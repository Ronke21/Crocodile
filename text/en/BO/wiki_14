==History==
===1848–1894: Foundation and early years===
The earliest record of a football match being played in the Huddersfield area is in 1848, when a team of men from Hepworth took on a team of men from Holmfirth near Whinney Bank in Holmfirth. Hepworth won a closely fought game which &quot;exhibited the usual amount of confusions, bloody noses, etc&quot; and took the prize of £5 which had been jointly donated by each side.

There appears to have been no formal structure to sport in the Huddersfield area until the opening of the Apollo Gymnasium on 3 August 1850. At this time the gymnasium was the only venue in the town where young men could take part in physical activities, it offered the opportunity to participate in fencing, swimming, bowling, cricket and many other sports.

In 1864 the Apollo Gymnasium was turned into the Gymnasium Theatre. The athletes of the gymnasium responded by forming a more organised athletics association. In an advertisement headed &quot;Huddersfield Athletic Club&quot; they invited &quot;gentlemen desirous of becoming members&quot; to a public meeting at 8 o&#x27;clock on the evening of 16 November 1864 at the Queen Hotel. The meeting went ahead, a hundred names were registered and a committee was formed. Within a month a new gymnasium was in service in a basement on Back John William Street. The club&#x27;s 1864 foundation (a few months before that of Hull F.C.) means that it is the oldest Rugby League club, both in terms of foundation date and continuous history; it celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2014.

On 27 January 1866, twenty members of the Huddersfield Athletic Club agreed to play a football match against twenty of the Huddersfield Rifle Corps at Rifle Field in Trinity Street. Although the result was a scoreless draw, a large crowd was attracted. In light of this, the Huddersfield Athletic Club agreed to start a football section which was to start at the beginning of December 1866. Initially the Huddersfield Athletic Club made no contribution to the support of the football club and each paying member was forced to pay a subscription of 2s/6d (half a crown/p). As the football club grew, it became a useful recruiting tool for the Huddersfield Athletic Club. In 1869 six matches were played and by 1870 three of the club&#x27;s players had been selected to represent Yorkshire. By 1872 there were so many players that a second team was formed.
The growth in popularity of the club and the need for better facilities led to the Huddersfield Athletic Club approaching St John&#x27;s Cricket Club with a proposal to merge the two clubs. St John&#x27;s Cricket Club had been formed in 1866 at Hillhouse and had moved to Fartown ground. By 1875, when amalgamation talks began, over £800 had been spent on developing the new ground. At a meeting on 27 November 1875, at the Thornhill Arms Inn the two clubs agreed to merge to form the Huddersfield Cricket and Athletics Club. The motion was passed by 55 votes to 37.

Initially the football section stayed at Rifle Field, but alterations made in the summer of 1878 meant that rugby could begin at the start of the 1878–79 season with the visit of Manchester Rangers on 2 November. The new ground would become the club&#x27;s home for 114 years and would provide the club&#x27;s famous &quot;Fartown&quot; nickname.

After the 1890–91 season, Huddersfield along with other Yorkshire Senior clubs Batley, Bradford, Brighouse, Dewsbury, Halifax, Huddersfield, Hull, Hunslet, Leeds, Liversedge, Manningham and Wakefield decided that they wanted their own county league starting in 1891 along the lines of a similar competition that had been played in Lancashire. The clubs wanted full control of the league but the Yorkshire Rugby Football Union would not sanction the competition as it meant giving up control of rugby football to the senior clubs.

===1895-1920s: Northern Union and golden years===
In 1895 the club were founder members of the Northern Rugby Football Union, (later the Rugby Football League).

The club has seen many ups and downs in its long history, but for the first 60 years of rugby league it was one of the powerhouses of the game, with only Wigan as rivals in terms of trophies won.

Harold Wagstaff was only fifteen years and one hundred and seventy-five days old when he played his first match for Huddersfield, against Bramley in November 1906. At the time, he was the youngest first-team player the game had seen, he had signed on for a £5 signing-on fee.

Huddersfield beat the touring 1908–09 Kangaroos 5–3. They were impressed enough with stand-off Albert Rosenfeld to sign him up that evening along with Australian Dual Code International Pat Walsh one of the best forwards of the Kangaroos. Rosenfeld played his first game against Broughton Rangers on 11 September 1909.

The club&#x27;s golden period came around the time of the First World War. The club was able to assemble a team of players from across the British Empire who swept all before them. Known as &quot;The Team of All Talents&quot;, they were led by Harold Wagstaff and are still regarded as one of the finest football teams ever to have played. In the five years leading up to the First World War they won 13 trophies.

Two members of the team, centre Harold Wagstaff and wing Albert Rosenfeld were honoured by inclusion in the original Rugby League Hall of Fame. They were later joined by the Cumberland second row Douglas Clark. Of just seventeen players to be elected to the Hall of Fame, no fewer than three were teammates in that famous Huddersfield side. In total, Huddersfield boast five representatives in the Hall of Fame, more than any other club.
The particular fame of &quot;The Team of All Talents&quot; sprung from their extraordinary three quarter play. In 1911–12, Rosenfeld became the first player to score more than 50 tries in a season – a feat previously thought to be impossible. That season he scored 78. His wing partner, Stan Moorhouse scored 52. In 1912–13, Rosenfeld scored 56, and then in 1913–14 he broke his own record with 80 tries, a record which stands to this day.

On 28 February 1914, the club defeated Swinton Park by a record 119–2 (Rosenfeld contributing 7 tries) in a Challenge Cup tie at Fartown. The record would stand until 26 November 1994 when the Huddersfield club broke their own World Record by defeating Blackpool Gladiators 142–4 in a Challenge Cup tie at the McAlpine Stadium – centre Greg Austin scoring 9 tries on his way to 52 tries that season, a world record for a centre. In the 1914–15 season they became only the second team to win &quot;all four cups&quot; when they lifted the Championship, the Challenge Cup, the Yorkshire County Cup, and the Yorkshire League. Huddersfield&#x27;s dominance prior to the First World War was such that they went unbeaten in 38 consecutive matches before the suspension of the league in 1915.

Huddersfield did not take part in the 1918–19 season. In the 1919–20 season, the first five games were won for a 43 match unbeaten run over six years which still stands as a record today. The unbeaten run consisted of 28 league matches, 8 Yorkshire Cup-ties, 5 Challenge Cup-ties and 2 League Championship play-offs. In addition, Huddersfield were drawing 8–8 in a Yorkshire Cup-tie that was abandoned because of fog and replayed.

The Yorkshire Cup and Yorkshire League trophies were already won when Huddersfield met Wigan in the Challenge Cup final which resulted in a 21–10 victory. Widnes were defeated in the Championship semi-final and Hull F.C. waited at Headingley as Huddersfield strove for a clean sweep of silverware. Huddersfield were missing five players who were touring Australasia with Great Britain and Hull won 3–2.

Albert Rosenfeld&#x27;s last game for the club was on 2 April 1921, a cup-tie against Leeds.

===Post-war era===
In the first full season after the war, a new record transfer fee of £1,650 was set when Dewsbury bought Bill Davies from Huddersfield.

Huddersfield won the League Championship in 1949, beating Warrington 13–12 in the final at Maine Road, Manchester in front of what was at the time a world record crowd of 75,194. This capitalised on a season which also brought home the Yorkshire League title.

The highest attendance at Fartown to watch a Huddersfield game was 32,912 against Wigan on 4 March 1950. More success followed in the 1950 season as Huddersfield retained the Yorkshire League title and reached another Championship final at Maine Road. However, on this occasion Wigan proved too strong, winning 20 points to 12. Huddersfield did, however, win the Yorkshire cup with a 16–3 victory over Castleford at Headingley.

On Saturday 17 November 1951, in an ordinary league game, Australian Lionel Cooper scored a club record ten tries, as Huddersfield defeated Keighley 48–3 at Fartown.

By the end of the 1950s, Huddersfield had won 3 Yorkshire cup finals, in 1950–51, 1952–53 and 1957–58, and the Challenge Cup final, in 1952–53. Huddersfield beat St. Helens 15–10 in the 1953 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley.

Wakefield Trinity beat Huddersfield 16–10 in the 1960 Yorkshire County Cup Final at Headingley, Leeds on 29 October 1960.

In the 1961–62 season Huddersfield were beaten by Wakefield Trinity in the Challenge Cup final but then the following week fortunes were reversed and Huddersfield won the Championship play off final at Odsal. This is the last major trophy the club collected.

In 1962, the league was split into East and West of the Pennines; Huddersfield and Hull Kingston Rovers met at Headingley, Leeds in the first final of the Eastern Division Championship on Saturday 10 November 1962.

Reigning Champions Huddersfield were favourites to lift the Eastern Division title, especially as Rovers were missing five first choice players with injuries. The Robins, however, set the early pace and were 10–0 up after 30 minutes. Despite a rally by Huddersfield, Rovers hung on to win 13–10.

===1970–1995: Decline and revival===
By the 1970s, the club had become a shadow of its former self; the old Fartown ground had fallen into disrepair and the club frequently finished in the lower reaches of the league. Local businessman, John Bailey, took a controlling interest in the stadium, the club and the pavilion. In 1984, in an attempt to revive the club, Huddersfield adopted the name &#x27;Barracudas&#x27; and Fartown was renamed &quot;Arena 84&quot;. As the crowds continued to stay away, it became clear that Bailey could not stem the decline.

Huddersfield Rugby League Club was on the point of collapse. A new board of directors took over in 1989 and injected some much needed financial resources into the club. The &#x27;Barracudas&#x27; and &#x27;Arena 84&#x27; names were dropped for the 1988–89 season. Nigel Stephenson was appointed as coach and Huddersfield were helped by several clubs, in particular Featherstone Rovers, to put a reasonable squad together. As well as beginning to improve the playing staff, the new owners also carried out a considerable amount of work on the Fartown stadium and by the end of the 1989–90 season significant progress was being made. Average crowds topped 1,000 for the first time in a decade.

Shortly after the 1991–92 season had begun, Alex Murphy took over as coach and Murphy led Huddersfield to become the first-ever champions of the newly formed third division. Promotion to the Second Division had been achieved, and there was pride once again in the famous claret and gold jersey. The expense of this achievement cost the club dearly and a new financial crisis arrived. However, along came a bright new consortium who it was hoped would begin to shape the future of the club once again. Unable to secure funding to upgrade it, the club left Fartown and moved to Huddersfield Town&#x27;s home ground at Leeds Road in 1992.

In 1993 six teams were invited to take part in an inaugural European Clubs Championship, the six teams consisted of two from the former USSR; Tiraspol and Moscow Magicians, two from France; AS Carcassonne and XIII Catalan,Batley and Huddersfield. Only weeks before departure, the plans collapsed as both Soviet clubs pulled out due to financial difficulties, closely followed by Batley and then Carcassonne who had just five players available due to a players&#x27; strike. This left just Huddersfield and XIII Catalan to meet in the &quot;final&quot; in Barcelona. The lead changed hands three times before Huddersfield held on for a 23–22 victory.

Following promotion as champions in 1991–92 Huddersfield finished a creditable 3rd in the 1992–93 second division, behind Featherstone and Oldham but the receiver was called in. In March 1994,Huddersfield went into administration and the receivers sacked Murphy as coach who was eventually replaced by George Fairburn. Under Fairburn&#x27;s tenure, the club finished 3rd again in the second division in 1994–95 and reached the final of the Second Division premiership competition at Old Trafford losing out to rivals Keighley Cougars and included a run to the quarter final of the challenge cup, beating rivals Halifax who were riding high in the first division and then hammering Keighley 30–0 at Keighley, a remarkable result considering Keighley had swept all before them and very rarely lost at home, the run was ended at Oldham where over 8,000 saw them go down 23–12 to the top tier side.

In November 1994, Huddersfield set world records for score and winning margin when they beat Blackpool Gladiators 142–4, although Barrow Raiders equalled the winning margin a day later by beating Nottingham City 138–0. These records stood for almost 24 years until York City Knights beat West Wales Raiders by 144–0 in April 2018.

===1992–1994 Ground moves and the end of Fartown===
In August 1992, following a 36–12 win over Ryedale York in a Yorkshire cup tie, although no one knew it at the time, it was to be the final ever game at Fartown, watched by 1,619 people, the next week, Huddersfield would begin their 2 year stint at the home of Huddersfield Town, however, plans had already been put in place for both the town&#x27;s professional clubs to groundshare. After the move from Fartown and the 2 seasons at Leeds Road, Huddersfield RLFC took a share in the new McAlpine Stadium (now known as John Smith&#x27;s Stadium), Huddersfield RLFC&#x27;s final game at Leeds Road saw Dewsbury inflict a 28–12 defeat on the Fartowners in a second division game on Thursday 21 April 1994. The new facility opened in August 1994, originally with just 2 stands completed and Huddersfield&#x27;s first game at the new ground saw Barrow thumped 50–12 in front of a crowd of 4,300. Although the reserves and junior teams continued to play at the ground, it was to be the final professional game played at the famous old ground.

===1996–1998: Summer era and the addition of Giants ===

In 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural Super League season and changed from a winter to a summer season. As the sport in Britain entered a new era it would be two years before Huddersfield rose again to the top level of the game. Ken Davy took over as chairman of Huddersfield and &quot;Giants&quot; was added to the team name.

Steve Ferres took over as coach. Garry Schofield joined Huddersfield for a six-figure sum. Ken Davy&#x27;s first trophy came in 1997 at Old Trafford, where Huddersfield beat Hull 18–0 in the Divisional Championship at Old Trafford. In 1998, due to the collapse of Paris Saint-Germain the club was promoted to Super League despite only finishing second in the second division. After helping the Giants into Super League, Schofield took over the coaching reins replacing Steve Ferres with Huddersfield saying that they needed a full-time coaching staff. Huddersfield struggled to adapt to a return to top tier for the first time in 2 decades, struggles continued, the team struggled to compete, winning only a handful of games. Garry Schofield was removed as Huddersfield Giants&#x27; coach after 13 games, having picked up two wins. Schofield was replaced by his assistant Phil Veivers as caretaker coach. Schofield later successfully sued the club for unfair dismissal. It took Huddersfield&#x27;s next three coaches more than 13 games to register two wins, with the club so far off the pace in their early Super League years.

===1999–2000: Huddersfield-Sheffield Giants===

Mal Reilly then took over with Veivers back as assistant coach. Huddersfield finished bottom of Super League and Reilly was sacked at the end of the season. In late 1999, the club merged with Sheffield Eagles almost purely for financial reasons. Sheffield coach John Kear took over as head coach of the merged side. They were officially known as the Huddersfield-Sheffield Giants, but more popularly as &#x27;Shuddersfield&#x27;. The Association of Premiership Clubs blocked proposals for a separate Huddersfield team in the Northern Ford Premiership. They played two home games in Sheffield at Bramall Lane with the others in Huddersfield, the away strip was in the Sheffield Eagles colours. In the 2000 season Huddersfield-Sheffield won only four games, three of them against rivals Wakefield Trinity Wildcats. This arrangement lasted only a season before the Huddersfield name was reverted to, due to rejection from both sets of fans. In the four seasons between 1998 and 2001, they lost 81 times in 99 matches, avoiding relegation for a variety of reasons. John Kear was sacked as coach and Veivers had a second spell as interim coach.

===2001–2004: Relegation and Revival again===
Australian Tony Smith was appointed as coach for the 2001 season after a rigorous process. This did not seem to have any effect as the club lost the first 14 matches of the season, culminating in a 78-point embarrassment by Bradford. This low point became a pivotal day for the club, however. The club won 6 and drew one of the remaining 14 games, only finishing bottom of the table after Wakefield Trinity&#x27;s appeal against a 4-point salary cap deduction was successful. Widnes won the NFP competition that year and the club was seen to be fit to play in Super League. Huddersfield were finally relegated, ironically, after their best season in Super League to date.

In 2002 Huddersfield remained a full-time professional team despite playing in the Northern Ford Premiership. The club went unbeaten for the entire league season, drawing only one match and winning a record equalling 29 games. Along the way the team accumulated 1,156 points to equal the record for points in a league season achieved in 8 more games by Leigh in 1986. The team won the Buddies Cup, as it was then known, and also the NFP Grand Final against Leigh in October 2002, which secured promotion back to the Super League for the 2003 season.

In 2003 under Smith, Huddersfield Giants finally established themselves as a Super League club, earning notable wins over Leeds (first time since 1965 ending a remarkable streak of 30 defeats), Wigan and St Helens and finishing 10th, above Wakefield Trinity and Halifax. After guiding Huddersfield back to Super League, Smith and assistant coach Brian McDermott moved onto Headingley to take control of Leeds. St Helens assistant coach and former Hull forward Jon Sharp was appointed head coach for 2004 and the team improved again, finishing 7th in the league and making their first appearance in the Challenge Cup semi-finals since 1971.

===2005–2009: Resurgence===
The beginning of the 2005 Super League season saw the club make its highest-profile signing in fifty years when Australian centre Michael De Vere signed from Brisbane Broncos, becoming the club&#x27;s first Australian international player since Pat Devery in the 1950s.

For the kick off of the 2006 season the club unveiled a host of new signings to strengthen the squad, including the iconic New Zealand international scrum-half Robbie Paul. After a convincing victory over Salford in the quarter final, the Giants faced Leeds (ironically coached by Tony Smith) in the Challenge Cup semi-final at Odsal, Bradford. Against all the odds, massive underdogs Huddersfield pulled out what is regarded as possibly their best performance of modern times, Stuart Donlan and Chris Nero with 2 tries apiece and Michael De Vere with a try and five goals steering them to a 30–12 victory. Huddersfield lost the 2006 Challenge Cup Final to eventual Super League champions St. Helens 42–12, but the performance heralded the best Huddersfield achievement since 1970.
The start of the 2007 season saw Huddersfield make some exciting signings, including Wests Tigers trio, Jamahl Lolesi, John Skandalis and Shane Elford, as well as Ryan Hudson. The season started horrendously for Huddersfield in terms of results. After seven consecutive losses they found themselves marooned at the foot of the table, 5 points adrift, but ironically with the second best defence in the league. Large sections of the fans began to question the coach&#x27;s ability and as a result crowds began to dwindle and morale was beginning to suffer.

By the end of May, the picture was totally different. Huddersfield had a Challenge Cup quarter-final to look forward to and had been on their longest ever winning streak since joining the Super League, nine games including two wins in the Challenge Cup including a 36–12 victory over Bradford in front of the Sky Television cameras on 18 May, Huddersfield&#x27;s first victory over Bradford since 1972 and ending a run of 20 consecutive defeats in the Super League era. In addition, John Sharp was named consecutively as Coach of the Month for April and May.

Huddersfield&#x27;s winning run came to an unexpected end in a shock 14–12 defeat by Salford at the Willows. They had been overwhelming favourites with fans and bookies. Following the 2006 Challenge Cup Final appearance, Giants continued their progress by beating Wakefield Trinity for the 9th consecutive occasion to qualify for the play-offs for the first time and a match against Hull F.C. at the KC Stadium, which was lost 22–16.

The opening 2 matches in 2008 were lost, to Leeds and to Bradford. However the 3rd match saw Sharp&#x27;s team beat Castleford 64–12. After a 48–0 loss to Catalans Dragons and a run of disappointing results, Sharp&#x27;s contract was terminated by Huddersfield. Following Sharp&#x27;s departure from the club in 2008, Kieron Purtill had a brief spell as caretaker coach alongside Paul Anderson.

Club chairman Ken Davy brought in a new head coach, Nathan Brown, and a new set of new players for the 2009 season. The season would prove to be the best the club had had for many years, new signing Brett Hodgson went on to win the Super League Man of Steel award and Huddersfield also picked up awards for &quot;Club of the Year&quot; and &quot;Coach of the Year&quot; for Brown. The Giants finished 3rd in the league and managed to reach the final of the Challenge Cup and marked the claret and gold&#x27;s first appearance at Wembley since 1962, however, they lost, somewhat controversially, 25–16 to league rivals Warrington, the team responded to their cup defeat by finishing the season in 3rd place but lost in the play-offs twice. Firstly to St. Helens away from home and then at home to Catalans Dragons but Huddersfield Giants were now a force in English Rugby League again.

===2010–2017: League leaders and decline===

Another decent season in 2010 saw the Giants finish the regular season in 5th, winning their last 5 games, but yet again, the play offs proved a tough nut to crack, following wins over Crusaders and a memorable win at Warrington, they succumbed to St Helens, playing their last ever game at Knowsley Road just 1 game away from the grand final. 2011 saw a 4th place finish, and included Huddersfield&#x27;s first win at Leeds since 1960 when a Danny Brough inspired Giants routed the Rhinos 38–4 but the Rhinos would get revenge, ending the Giants&#x27; season in the play offs, there was another cup quarter final appearance but the Giants lost to Castleford. 

After another promising recruitment drive from Huddersfield, they were yet again tipped to make big strides in the Super League in 2012. This season really proved as a roller-coaster ride for the &quot;Fartown Faithful&quot; who saw their team go from leading the Super League up to the halfway point but then tailing off to finish a disappointing 7th and yet again failing to make an impact on the play-offs, being comfortbaly beaten by Hull, However, another cup run gave the fans hope but they came up against a red-hot Warrington side in the semi final who beat them 33–6. During the season and during the poor dip in form Ken Davy decided it was time for change and terminated the contracts of coach Nathan Brown and captain Kevin Brown. Paul Anderson was given the task of finishing the season as best as possible, it was a sad end to Both Brown&#x27;s Huddersfield careers.

2013 was seen as somewhat of a transition season, with Anderson able to mould his own team after taking over midway through a tumultuous period the previous year, however, Anderson&#x27;s charges got off to a flyer, recording their first win at St Helens since 1978 with a 40–4 drubbing, that form kept up and Huddersfield found themselves in the top 2 for most of the season, a 30–12 hammering of Wigan, signalled the end of Wigan&#x27;s challenge and Huddersfield won the League Leader&#x27;s Shield, the first time they have finished top of the league in 81 years by hammering Rivals Wakefield 40–0. 5 of the team were selected for the Super League Dream Team, more than any other club, however, once again the play offs proved too much for the Giants, following a weakened team finishing the regular season with a big defeat at Bradford, Wigan beat Huddersfield in the first stage of the play off, meaning the Giants missed the chance to finally book a place at Old Trafford for the grand final, they were given a second chance however, and after seeing off Hull with a sublime performance to win 76–18, they again came unstuck at the hands of the Warrington Wolves and their season ended in bitter disappointment again.

In 2014, the club celebrated the 100th anniversary of the &quot;Team of all Talents&quot; who won &quot;All Four Cups&quot; in 1914, by playing in heritage jerseys to commemorate the feat, another 3rd place regular season finish saw another defeat in the play offs, this time, at the hands of Catalans Dragons at home, following a 57–4 hammering at Wigan in the first round.
2015 saw another push, but this time a 4th place finish, and after finishing 3rd in the &#x27;Super 8&#x27;s&#x27; earned another crack at Old Trafford, but again, the club failed to take the next step, beaten 32–8 at Wigan.

During the 2016 season, after a run of bad form, the Giants won only 1 out of their first 10 games, and lying at the bottom of the table, Anderson was dismissed as head coach, with Andy Kelly taking charge on an interim basis for a few games. It was later announced that the club had agreed terms with Australian Rick Stone to be the replacement head coach. Stone could not halt the slide and the club finished bottom of the regular season table for the first time since 2001, following the introduction of the &#x27;Super 8&#x27;s&#x27; the season before, the Giants narrowly avoided the relegation play off game by beating Hull KR 23–22 in their final game of the season.

2017 saw an overall improvement for the Giants as they finished 8th at the end of the regular season. A poor start to the season, not helped by injuries, culminated with the club being dumped out of the challenge cup at the first attempt by championship side Swinton, following the death of Jennifer Davy, long time supporter and wife of owner and chairman Ken, the team saw a more successful finish after the mid-season signings of Jordan Turner and Jordan Rankin, the week after the Swinton defeat, and with the club still in mourning for Mrs Davy, they went to Leeds with a depleted side and beat the Rhinos 31–12 in a highly emotional night for everyone concerned with the club. Following the Super8s, they remained in 8th. It was announced in September that Giants&#x27; prop Sebastine Ikahihifo had achieved a place in the Super League Dream Team after a highly impressive performance that season.

==== 2017: Women&#x27;s Side ====

In December 2017, it was announced that Huddersfield would be fielding an under 19s girls side for the 2018 season, with the overall aim of producing a competitive Women&#x27;s Super League team in 2019. Trials were held in January 2018. Huddersfeild Giants women team have played in the Women&#x27;s super league since 2021, in the 2022 season they finished bottom of the league, but avoided relegation. 

Only 3 years after forming, Huddersfield Giants Women won the Super League shield final in October 2021 by beating Featherstone Rovers 24–22 at Headingley and reached the Challenge Cup quarter final in 2022 but lost to reigning champions St Helens

===2018–2024: Woolford out, Watson failure===
Following a disappointing start to the 2018 season in which Huddersfield only won two of their opening seven games, head coach Rick Stone was sacked. former player, captain and academy coach Chris Thorman was announced as head coach on an interim basis to lead the team over the Easter period, Thorman could not stop the rot though, losing five and drawing one of his six games in charge. On 29 April 2018, former Canberra Raiders and St. George Illawarra Dragons player Simon Woolford was announced as the Giants new head coach, Woolford turned things around somewhat, winning 12 of his first 14 games as head coach, there was also a cup quarter final defeat at the hands of the Catalans Dragons but Huddersfield lost their last five games of the &#x27;Super 8&#x27;s&#x27; as Woolford&#x27;s honeymoon period ended.
Woolford&#x27;s first full season in 2019 was a difficult one, a bad start saw them languishing bottom before a brief pick up saw them up to 8th, but they could not sustain it and eventually finished 10th out of 12 teams. 
2020 saw a good start, winning four of the first five games and sitting 2nd on the ladder, a cup defeat at the hands of Toronto Wolfpack in March was disappointing but it proved to be the last game before the Covid pandemic struck, when the season resumed in August, with no crowds and at neutral grounds, the Giants could not replicate their early season form and they slipped down to 8th, despite being popular with the fans, Woolford left the Giants in September 2020 after being unable to agree a new contract, Luke Robinson took over as interim head coach until the end of season.

In 2020, the club announced that it had appointed Ian Watson as head coach from Salford starting in the 2021 Super League season. Watson was seen as the sports&#x27; best British coach after taking unfaniced Salford to a grand final and a challenge cup final, losing them both, but his Salford sides were seen as strong, fit, entertaining and hard to beat, his stock grown as Salford, like Huddersfield, had smaller crowds and smaller financial pull as other clubs, Watson was brought in to completely overhaul the playing and conditioning side of the club. The club had a disappointing year in the 2021 season finishing seventh on the table and missing the play off series but there did appear to be a change in attitude of the playing squad, Watson disposed of high profile, high earning players who were not prepared to do things his way and follow his processes. 

2022 became Huddersfield&#x27;s best season in a decade with Watson repeating his success with Salford when he steered Huddersfield to the Challenge cup final in May 2022, a comprehensive 25–4 semi final win over favourites Hull Kingston Rovers at Elland Road secured a final place against Wigan Warriors at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.On 28 May 2022, Huddersfield played in the 2022 Challenge Cup Final against Wigan. Huddersfield led Wigan for nearly the entire match until Wigan scored a try with two minutes remaining to win the game 16–14 and deny Huddersfield their first major trophy win in 60 years.
Huddersfield would finish the 2022 Super League season in third place on the table. In the elimination play off, Huddersfield suffered a shock 28–0 loss against Salford which ended their season. but hopes were high that the Watson effect was finally taking over.
Hopes for the 2023 Season were high following a decent 2022 but the team struggled to replicate their form and their playing style from 2022, following consecutive nillings, Huddersfield were dumped out of the cup at the first attempt by Watson&#x27;s old club, Salford, 4 heavy defeats followed putting pressure on Watson, who was required to get positive results and who the club had high hopes for, instead the Giants found themselves in 10th place and with their season petering out disappointingly, unrest about Watson&#x27;s methods were starting to grow. Huddersfield had a difficult campaign finishing ninth on the table and missing the playoffs.

In the 2024 Super League season, Huddersfield had a decent start, winning seven of their first ten games but the season would soon mirror the previous year, Watson was now under serious pressure, with his methods, performance and results scrutinised, following a run of one win in nine games, including a humiliating 46–10 pasting by Warrington in a cup semi final and with crowds dwindling rapidly, Watson was relieved of his duties following another (0–48) defeat at Warrington. Luke Robinson was once again given the interim head coach role but the damage was done with the club once again finishing 9th on the table.

===2025–present===
It was announced in September 2024 that Luke Robinson had been appointed head coach on a three-year deal.

===Academy/Youth system===
Despite not being one of the bigger or successful clubs in Super League, the Giants have a very good academy system, backed by the Supporters Association, who provide volunteers to run and promote the games and raise vital funds, in 2018, the academy team, under head of youth Andy Kelly and head coach Luke Robinson, and nicknamed &quot;Baby Giants&quot; by the supporters, made it to the top 4 grand final play off semi final for the first time. They were joined by Wigan, St Helens and Leeds, however they lost 50–0 to Wigan.[21] Some of that team have now made the step up to first grade level and as of 2022 Jake Wardle, Oliver Russell, Innes Senior, Louis Senior, Sam Hewitt, Jon Luke Kirby, Matty English, Oliver Wilson, Ronan Michael, Dom Young have all made the step up to first grade rugby. Other graduates from the Giants academy in the recent past include Huddersfield legends Leroy Cudjoe, Michael Lawrence and Jermaine McGillvary, also, Kruise Leeming, Jake Connor, Darnell McIntosh Sam Wood . As of 2022 there are currently 18 members of the first team squad who have graduated through Huddersfield&#x27;s own youth system.

==Stadia==
===1878–1992: Fartown Ground===

The Fartown Ground was originally a cricket ground before being occupied by Huddersfield rugby club in 1878. It hosted two Challenge Cup finals in 1908 and 1910 and hosted one football match. During the 1980s, the stadium fell into disrepair as Huddersfield struggled to attract crowds. Huddersfield left Fartown in 1992, but still used it as a training ground until 2004 and it still hosts amateur games.

===1992–1994: Leeds Road===

Huddersfield ground shared with Huddersfield Town at Leeds Road from 1992 to 1994.


===1994–Present: Kirklees Stadium===
In 1994 Huddersfield took a share in the then named McAlpine Stadium with Huddersfield Town after they both moved from Leeds Road. The stadium has hosted Challenge Cup semi finals on multiple occasions. The venue has a capacity of 24,500 with the Giants attendance record being 15,629 set on 10 February 2008 for match against rivals Leeds.

The club&#x27;s Academy, scholarship and Reserves side currently use the facilities at the Laund Hill complex which is home to Huddersfield YMCA Rugby Union club

==Supporters==
Despite not having the largest fanbase in super league they have a dedicated and loyal fanbase and a consistent following of around 200–300 dedicated away fans and average 4,000+ at a majority of the home games, the fans have been nicknamed &quot;the Cowbell Army&quot; due to the presence of Cowbells amongst the crowd.
There is also a vibrant contingent of fans known as &#x27;Block 7&#x27; at home games who sing, chant and creates a visual support for the team, this idea was developed in mid 2022.

The Huddersfield Giants Supporters Association (HGSA) are a voluntary group of supporters which aims to raise funds for the academy and scholarship teams, they hosts regular guest speakers evenings, fundraising events and also collect donations for a local food bank charity. They also help organise and promote the club&#x27;s reserves, under 18&#x27;s Academy and Under 16&#x27;s Scholarship games and raise valuable funds towards junior development, as well as liaising with the club on behalf of the supporters.

In 2019 the group were nominated for an award in the prestigious Huddersfield Community Awards evening for their work in junior and community development.

<text>Broadland is a local government district in Norfolk, England, named after the Norfolk Broads. Its council is based at the Broadland Business Park on the outskirts of Norwich. The district includes the towns of Acle, Aylsham, Reepham, Sprowston and Thorpe St Andrew. Several of the district&#x27;s settlements (including Sprowston and Thorpe St Andrew) form part of the Norwich built-up area, lying outside the city&#x27;s boundaries to the north-west and north-east. The district also includes numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. Some eastern parts of the district lie within The Broads.

The neighbouring districts are North Norfolk, Great Yarmouth, South Norfolk, Norwich and Breckland.

In 2013, Broadland was ranked as the most peaceful locality within the United Kingdom, having the lowest level of violent crime in the country.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole of one former district and parts of another, which were both abolished at the same time:
*Blofield and Flegg Rural District (parishes lying generally south-west of the River Bure, rest went to Great Yarmouth)
*St Faith&#x27;s and Aylsham Rural District

The new district was named Broadland after the Broads.

The council appointed a shared managing director with neighbouring South Norfolk Council in 2018. The two councils&#x27; staff were merged in 2020 and the councils moved to a new shared building in 2023.

==Governance==

Broadland District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Norfolk County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In the parts of the district within The Broads, town planning is the responsibility of the Broads Authority. The district council appoints one of its councillors to sit on that authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 elections, being run by a coalition of the Liberal Democrats, Labour, and Greens, led by Liberal Democrat councillor Sue Holland.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a subsequent by-election in September 2023 the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last full review of boundaries in 2004 the council has comprised 47 councillors representing 27 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

;UK Youth Parliament

Although the UK Youth Parliament is an apolitical organisation, the elections are run in a way similar to that of the Local Elections. The votes come from 11 to 18-year olds and are combined to make the decision of the next, 2-year Member of Youth Parliament. The elections are run at different times across the country with Broadland&#x27;s typically being in early Spring and bi-annually. Due to the large scale nature of Broadland&#x27;s and its bordering with all other districts, the district is represented by all four MYPs for Norfolk for ease and true representation.

===Premises===
In 2023 the council moved to the Horizon Centre, a modern office building at the Broadland Business Park on the outskirts of Norwich (in the parish of Postwick with Witton). The council shares the building with South Norfolk Council as part of their joint management and staff arrangement.
Prior to 2023 the council was based at Thorpe Lodge at 1 Yarmouth Road in Thorpe St Andrew, a converted 1820s house with substantial 1970s extensions.

==Towns and parishes==
The district is divided into 65 civil parishes. The parish councils for Aylsham, Reepham, Sprowston and Thorpe St Andrew have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council. The three most populous parishes at the 2021 census were Sprowston, Thorpe St Andrew and Hellesdon, all of which form part of the Norwich built-up area.

The district contains the following civil parishes:

*Acle, Alderford, Attlebridge, Aylsham
*Beeston St. Andrew, Beighton, Belaugh, Blickling, Blofield, Booton, Brampton, Brandiston, Brundall, Burgh and Tuttington, Buxton Lammas, Buxton
*Cantley, Cawston, Coltishall, Crostwick
*Drayton
*Felthorpe, Foulsham, Freethorpe, Frettenham
*Great Plumstead, Great Witchingham, Guestwick
*Hainford, Halvergate, Haveringland, Hellesdon, Hemblington, Hevingham, Heydon, Honingham, Horsford, Horsham St Faith, Horsham St Faith and Newton St Faith, Horstead with Stanninghall
*Lingwood and Burlingham, Little Plumstead, Little Witchingham
*Marsham, Morton on the Hill
*Old Catton, Oulton
*Postwick with Witton
*Rackheath, Reedham, Reepham, Ringland
*Salhouse, Salle, South Walsham, Spixworth, Sprowston, Stratton Strawless, Strumpshaw, Swannington
*Taverham, Themelthorpe, Thorpe St. Andrew
*Upton with Fishley
*Weston Longville, Woodbastwick, Wood Dalling, Wroxham

==Climate==
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot;. (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).
== Controversies ==
A total of £357,000 was paid to two managers leaving Broadland council as a result of the merger of two management teams at Broadland and South Norfolk councils, reported Private Eye in October 2020. (A further £594,000 in termination payments was to be shared between three managers leaving South Norfolk council due to the merger.) The councils reportedly claimed these so-called &quot;golden goodbyes&quot; would actually save money, as they would have fewer highly paid senior officials after they departed.

<doc id="449145" wikidata="Q488142" url="?curid=449145" title="Breckland District">
<text>Breckland is a local government district in Norfolk, England. Its council is based in Dereham, although the largest town is Thetford. The district also includes the towns of Attleborough, Swaffham and Watton, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas.

The district derives its name from the Breckland landscape region, a gorse-covered sandy heath of south Norfolk and north Suffolk. The term &quot;Breckland&quot; dates back to at least the 13th century.

The neighbouring districts are King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk, North Norfolk, Broadland, South Norfolk, Mid Suffolk and West Suffolk.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering six former districts which were all abolished at the same time:
*East Dereham Urban District
*Mitford and Launditch Rural District
*Swaffham Rural District
*Swaffham Urban District
*Thetford Municipal Borough
*Wayland Rural District

The new district was named Breckland after the distinctive landscape which covers parts of the area. The name was chosen following a competition organised by the outgoing authorities which invited local schools, organisations and individuals to put forward suggested names.

==Governance==
Breckland District Council, which styles itself &quot;Breckland Council&quot;, provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Norfolk County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Conservative majority control since 1999.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1998 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and subsequent by-elections and changes of allegiance up to February 2025, the composition of the council was:

Four of the independent councillors and the Green councillor sit together as the &#x27;Independent and Green Group&#x27;. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2015 the council has comprised 49 councillors representing 27 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

====UK Youth Parliament====

Although the UK Youth Parliament is an apolitical organisation, the elections are run in a way similar to that of the Local Elections. The votes come from 11 to 18 year olds and are combined to make the decision of the next, 2 year Member of Youth Parliament. The elections are run at different times across the country with Breckland&#x27;s typically being in early Spring and bi-annually.
===Premises===
The council has its headquarters at Elizabeth House, a modern office building on the edge of Dereham; the council moved its main offices there in 2003. Prior to that it had been based at the Guildhall on St Withburga Lane in Dereham, which had previously been the offices of Mitford and Launditch Rural District Council, one of the council&#x27;s predecessors.
The council also maintains an area office at Breckland House on St Nicholas Street in Thetford, which was completed in 1992 and formally opened on 20 May 1993 by Elizabeth II.

==Towns and parishes==

The district is entirely divided into 113 civil parishes. The parish councils for Attleborough, Dereham, Swaffham, Thetford and Watton have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council. The parishes are:

*Ashill, Attleborough
*Banham, Bawdeswell, Beachamwell, Beeston with Bittering, Beetley, Besthorpe, Billingford, Bintree, Blo&#x27; Norton, Bradenham, Brettenham, Bridgham, Brisley, Bylaugh

<text>North Norfolk is a local government district in Norfolk, England. Its council is based in Cromer, and the largest town is North Walsham. The district also includes the towns of Fakenham, Holt, Sheringham, Stalham and Wells-next-the-Sea, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas.

The district lies on the north coast of Norfolk, facing the North Sea, with much of its coastline lying within the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Some south-eastern parts of the district lie within The Broads. The neighbouring districts are Great Yarmouth, Breckland, Broadland and King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering seven former districts which were all abolished at the same time:
*Cromer Urban District
*Erpingham Rural District
*North Walsham Urban District
*Sheringham Urban District
*Smallburgh Rural District
*Walsingham Rural District
*Wells-next-the-Sea Urban District
A committee of the outgoing councils drew up a list of possible names for the new district to be considered by the Local Government Boundary Commission. Suggested names included North Norfolk, Seafields, Pastonacres, Norfolk Coastal and Cromer. The commission chose the name Pastonacres, which had been coined by a member of Smallburgh Rural District Council in recognition of the extensive landholdings in the area of the Paston family in medieval times. The name was not a popular choice locally, and at the very first meeting of the shadow Pastonacres District Council elected in 1973 it was resolved to change the name to North Norfolk, which was agreed by the government in September 1973, before the new district formally came into being in 1974.

==Governance==

North Norfolk District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Norfolk County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In the parts of the district within The Broads, town planning is the responsibility of the Broads Authority. The district council appoints one of its councillors to sit on that authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under Liberal Democrat majority control since 2019.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2004 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and subsequent by-elections and changes of allegiance up to July 2024, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 40 councillors representing 32 wards, with each ward electing one or two councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Council Offices on Holt Road in Cromer. The building was purpose-built for the council and opened in 1990.

==Geography==

At the time of the 2001 census, the district had an area of , with a population of 98,382 in 43,502 households.

==Demography==

The 2021 census results found that the local authority area had the highest proportions of population over 65 in the England and Wales, at 33.5%.
==Towns and parishes==

The district is entirely covered by 121 civil parishes. The parish councils for Cromer, Fakenham, Holt, North Walsham, Sheringham, Stalham and Wells-next-the-Sea have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;.

== Controversies ==
Almost £389,000 was given to the council&#x27;s &quot;joint head of paid services&quot;, Nick Baker, in the form of an &quot;exit package&quot;, reported &quot;Private Eye&quot; in October 2020. This was £89,000 more than the council had spent purchasing dwellings to support homeless people in 2019/20, the &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot; reported. The council&#x27;s opposition leader, Christopher Cushing, was quoted describing the payment to Baker as &quot;extraordinary&quot;. The &quot;Press&quot; also reported the total cost of so-called &quot;golden goodbyes&quot; for senior council staff had risen to £1.8 million.

<text>South Northamptonshire was a local government district in Northamptonshire, England, from 1974 to 2021. Its council was based in the town of Towcester, first established as a settlement in Roman Britain. The population of the Local Authority District Council in 2011 was 85,189.

The largest town in the district was Brackley, which had a population of 14,000 in 2008, followed by Towcester, which had a population of nearly 10,000. Other significant settlements in size included Deanshanger, Bugbrooke, Roade, King&#x27;s Sutton, Silverstone and Middleton Cheney. Many of the villages listed had populations exceeding 1,000.

==Geography==

===Elevations and shape===
The northern half of the district was generally higher than the south, reaching 192m AOD northeast of the centre of Aston-le-Walls, and 182m on the road east of Culworth, a village which also rests on top of the ridge following the general WSW line of the county and of the district but except for this is north of the district. This ridge is part of the Jurassic Way. Lower parts are at 85m AOD (above mean sea level) in the southwest corner and AOD in the northeast.

The district was shaped approximately like the Christian cross in an ENE orientation extending from its top at the southeast of Northampton and reaching to a north–south line south-by-southeast of Banbury, Oxfordshire. An additional arm near its foot reached north through the large village of Chipping Warden to Upper Boddington.

===Soil and geology===
Land was taken up with for the most part with arable agriculture peppered by villages, however allows space for two towns of significant size. Supporting this is a regular interspersion of two high fertility types of soil for most plants and crops: &quot;freely draining slightly acid but base-rich&quot;; and &quot;lime-rich loamy and clayey soils with impeded drainage&quot; soils, on a default (generally slightly lower) soil of &quot;slowly permeable seasonally wet slightly acid but base-rich loamy and clayey soils&quot; (of medium fertility). The district in terms of watercourses had sources and headwaters of the rivers Cherwell, Great Ouse and Nene.

===Whittlewood Forest===
Whittlewood Forest occupies a modest area for a forest and is broken up by fields (in the southern arm close to Milton Keynes which reaches to the Great Ouse) and this surrounds Whittlebury, the fields south of the upland village of Paulerspury on straight, Roman Watling Street which passes through the forest. This lies between Silverstone and Potterspury (also with a conservation area on Watling Street) or equally between Deanshanger and Towcester.

==Demography and human geography==
With just over 79,293 people in 2000 and 91,000 in 2008, a 14.8% increase.

The growth in population between 2001 and 2007 was the third largest of all districts in the country and consisted of 35,700 households.

The district was notable for the proportion of and growth in detached houses, and the district was one of a tiny proportion to have seen a growth in the proportion of this type of home relative to other types between 2001 and 2011.

==History==

The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, and was a merger of the municipal borough of Brackley, along with Brackley Rural District, Towcester Rural District, and part of Northampton Rural District.

The council chose to based itself in Towcester. It was initially based itself at Towcester Town Hall, which had been built in 1865 and had been bought by Towcester Rural District Council in 1935. The council moved to a new building at the junction of Springfields and Brackley Road in 1982, which in turn was replaced by another new building called The Forum on Moat Lane in 2015.

==Abolition and replacement==
In March 2018 at Northamptonshire County Council, following financial and cultural mismanagement by the cabinet and officers, the then Secretary of State for Local Government, Sajid Javid, sent commissioner Max Caller into the council, who recommended the county council and all district and borough councils in the county be abolished, and replaced by two unitary authorities, one covering the West, and one the North of the county. These proposals were approved in April 2019. It meant that the districts of Daventry, Northampton and South Northamptonshire were merged to form a new unitary authority called West Northamptonshire, whilst the second unitary authority North Northamptonshire consists of Corby, East Northamptonshire, Kettering and Wellingborough districts. These new authorities came into being on 1 April 2021. Elections for the new authorities were due to be held on 7 May 2020, but were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>East Northamptonshire was a local government district in Northamptonshire, England, from 1974 to 2021. Its council was based in Thrapston and Rushden. Other towns included Oundle, Raunds, Irthlingborough and Higham Ferrers. The town of Rushden was by far the largest settlement in the district. The population of the district at the 2011 Census was 86,765.

The district bordered onto the Borough of Corby, the Borough of Kettering, the Borough of Wellingborough, the Borough of Bedford, the City of Peterborough, the District of Huntingdonshire, South Kesteven District and the unitary authority county of Rutland.

The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by a merger of the municipal borough of Higham Ferrers, with the urban districts of Irthlingborough, Oundle, Raunds and Rushden, along with Oundle and Thrapston Rural District, and Newton Bromswold from Wellingborough Rural District.

Much of the district was home to Rockingham Forest, once a Royal hunting forest which takes its name from the village of Rockingham where William I built a castle.

The district was home to several of Northamptonshire&#x27;s airfields including Spanhoe, King&#x27;s Cliffe, Deenethorpe, Polebrook, Chelveston and Lyveden.

==Abolition and replacement==
In March 2018, following suspension of the County Council arising from its becoming insolvent, due to financial and cultural mismanagement by the cabinet and officers, the then Secretary of State for Local Government, Sajid Javid, sent commissioner Max Caller into the council, who recommended the county council and all district and borough councils in the county be abolished, and replaced by two unitary authorities, one covering the West, and one the North of the county. These proposals were approved in April 2019. It meant that the districts of Daventry, Northampton and South Northamptonshire were merged to form a new unitary authority called West Northamptonshire, whilst the second unitary authority North Northamptonshire consists of Corby, East Northamptonshire, Kettering and Wellingborough districts. These new authorities came into being on 1 April 2021. Elections for the new authorities were due to be held on 7 May 2020, but were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Geography==
There were six towns in the district. Rushden was by far the largest with a population of 29,272. It is situated in the very south of the district and forms a single urban area with the neighbouring town of Higham Ferrers which has a population of 7,145. The second largest town in the district was Raunds, population 8,641 followed closely by Irthlingborough, population 8,535. The smallest town in the district was Thrapston where the HQ of the East Northamptonshire council was located. Oundle is a historical market town with many ancient buildings, including St Peter&#x27;s parish church with the tallest spire in the county and a large public school. Higham Ferrers, which is part of Rushden&#x27;s urban area, was the birthplace for Henry Chichele and home of Chichele College. Irthlingborough was home to Rushden &amp; Diamonds Football Club before its liquidation.

There were no railway stations in East Northamptonshire. There is one College in East Northamptonshire.

==Election results==

2019 no election in any of the Northamptonshire districts, following a budgetary overspending crisis and subsequent plans to merge East Northamptonshire local authority with three other districts/boroughs to form a unitary authority of North Northamptonshire. In the meantime, councillors terms of office were extended at least up to 2020.

<doc id="449157" wikidata="Q4862422" url="?curid=449157" title="Baron Grey of Codnor">
<text>The title of Baron Grey of Codnor is a title in the peerage of England.
This barony was called out of abeyance in 1989, after 493 years, in favour of the Cornwall-Legh family of East Hall, High Legh, Cheshire. The Lords Grey of Codnor are senior lineal representatives of the noble house of Grey, and as hereditary peers are eligible for election to a seat in the House of Lords. They descend from the eldest son of Henry de Grey, whose younger son Sir John de Grey was father of the first Baron Grey de Wilton. The first Baron Grey of Ruthyn was son of a younger son of the 2nd Baron Grey de Wilton, and Sir John Grey of Groby, descended from a younger son of the 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn, was the ancestor of the last known male-line branch of the ancient Greys, who held and lost the titles of Marquess of Dorset and Duke of Suffolk before being created Baron Grey of Groby and then Earl of Stamford before extinction in 1976. The last Earl was coincidentally seated at Dunham Massey, near High Legh.

== History ==
This branch of the ancient Grey family was ed in the Middle Ages at Codnor Castle. Together with the other noble branches of the Greys, they share descent from the Norman knight Anchetil de Greye, a vassal of King William I. During the reign of King John, Sir Henry de Grey purchased the manor of Grays Thurrock in Essex from Isaac the Jew and his son Josce, confirmed by the king in 1195. Sir Henry de Grey also held the manor of Codnor, Derbyshire, granted by the boy King Henry III&#x27;s regents, as well as the manor of Grimston, Nottinghamshire; he married Isolda, daughter of Sir Hugh Bardolf by his wife Isabel &quot;née&quot; Twist. Sir Henry died a few years later in 1219, and his widow married again to Sir Reynold de Bohun.

Sir Henry de Grey&#x27;s many offspring include: his second son to whom he left the encumbered manor of Shirland; Sir John Grey, knighted for services to the King&#x27;s Stewardship of Sherwood Forest, who acquired the estates of Sir John de Huntingfield via his second marriage; his brother William Grey of Cavendish, Landford and Sandiacre, ancestor of the Barons Walsingham, whose ancestral domain remains a catholic shrine and place of pilgrimage; a fourth brother Henry died young; the eldest Richard de Grey inherited the title and estates as Baron Grey of Codnor: a key supporter of Henry of Winchester and the Provençals he was appointed Warden of the Channel Isles, charged with guarding the English coastline against potential French invasion. As well as being Sheriff of Hertfordshire and Essex, Lord Grey played a vital role on the coast of Gascony between 1248 and 1253. However, he fell out with the maturing King and his new courtiers, rebelling with De Montfort at the Battle of Lewes; he was captured after Evesham and taken prisoner, forfeited his lands, but in recognition of his blood rights, later restored to rightful inheritance. By 1223 he had married Lucy, daughter and heiress of John de Hume, before dying on 8 September 1271. His son, John de Grey married Lucy, daughter of Sir Raynold de Mohun of Dunster Castle, Somerset by Hawise, daughter of William le Fleming, and may have outlived his aged father by only a few months, leaving a fifteen-year-old boy to inherit.
Sir Henry de Grey saw military service under Edward I, was summoned to Parliament by writ in 1299, and before that, on the Gascony campaign of 1294–1297 He campaigned with Edward I at the Siege of Caerlaverock, and may have been with him on his last and fatal campaign across the Solway Firth in 1306–07. He seems to have been summoned to the Model Parliament as one of the King&#x27;s great nobles. His first wife was Eleanor Courtenay, sister of the 1st Earl of Devon, a fellow officer. After her death, he married Joan, daughter of Sir Ralph de Cromwell on 6 June 1301. He only left three children before he died in September 1308. His eldest, Sir Richard (1282–1335) was one of the Lords ordainer who rebelled against the Despencers, favourites of Edward II, but was subsequently pardoned in 1321. His son, Sir John took his mother&#x27;s FitzPayne lands in Nottingham, distinguished himself on the battlefield in Scotland and was appointed a Knight of the Garter. Lord Grey was at the Battle of Crecy and Siege of Calais. He was appointed Keeper of Rochester Castle, and married Alice, daughter of Sir Warren de Lisle, himself a distinguished soldier. His son, Sir Henry married the daughter of one of the most distinguished generals of Edward III&#x27;s court, Sir Reynold de Cobham , a brilliant commander, victorious in many battles and ancestor of the Viscounts Cobham. Grey married Joan de Cobham who gave birth to Richard, 1st Baron Grey de Codnor.

This ancient barony was created simply as Grey by writ, but is referred to as &quot;&quot;Grey of Codnor&quot; or &quot;Grey (of Codnor)&quot;&quot; to distinguish it from other Grey baronies, and so as not to be confused with the extant Grey earldom (&quot;of tea fame&quot;, a different branch of the family); by convention holders of such ancient baronies were styled simply as &quot;&quot;The Right Honourable The Lord Grey&quot; (but nowadays only as Rt Hon. if also appointed a Privy Counsellor). The style of &quot;Lord Grey&quot;&quot; had also previously been used a courtesy title by the Earls of Stamford and Warrington.

The Greys produced among others, Sir Richard de Grey (later 4th Baron), who pursued a distinguished career in the service of Edward III: Admiral of the Thames and South, King&#x27;s Chamberlain, Deputy Constable of the Tower, Marshal of All England and Keeper of several castles. Granted substantial lands on the Welsh Marches, he was responsible for crushing Owain Glyndŵr&#x27;s rebellion in 1410 and as Steward of Sherwood Forest and Constable of Nottingham Castle, his responsibilities later extended into the lawless lands of the South Wales valleys becoming Justiciar of Wales; subsequently he was posted on a diplomatic mission to Gascony, assuming the captaincy of Argentan Castle, during Henry V&#x27;s second French expedition in 1417. He married Elizabeth, younger daughter and co-heir of Ralph, 1st Baron Basset. Lord Grey died on 1 August 1418, leaving numerous issue.

In 1496, the title became abeyant on the death of the 7th Baron between his aunts, the three daughters of the 4th Baron: Elizabeth Zouche, Eleanor Newport, and Lucy Lenthall. A termination petition was first submitted to Parliament by Charles Walker, &quot;later&quot; Cornwall-Legh, who held a one-twelfth claim to the title, in 1926. Later that year the House of Lords select committee chaired by Lord Sumner recommended that &quot;inter alia&quot; no abeyance should be considered which is longer in date than 100 years and that only claims where the claimant lays claim to at least one-third of the dignity be considered. Cornwall-Legh died in 1934, and his son, Charles Legh Shuldham Cornwall-Legh , was permitted a relaxation of these conditions in 1936 as the original claim had begun before the parliamentary committee reported. After grants for extensions of time for various reasons submitted by Charles Cornwall-Legh, in 1989 the House of Lords Committee for Privileges, chaired by Lord Wilberforce, examined his legal right to the peerage title, &quot;Baron Grey de Codnor, of Codnor in the County of Derbyshire&quot;. It found that although the first, second and third Barons were summoned to Parliament, there was no evidence that they sat in a properly constituted Parliament. Richard Grey, fourth Baron was summoned in 1397, and did sit, and they held that the barony should be dated from then. It was satisfied that all proper and possible enquiries had been made to trace the descendants of Lucy, Eleanor and Elizabeth, which included Richard Bridgeman, 7th Earl of Bradford (a descendant of Eleanor (Newport)). The abeyance was subsequently terminated by Elizabeth II in favour of the Cornwall-Legh family, descendants of Lucy (Lenthall), which succeeded in the title in 1989. It was held in the judgement of 1989 that the 2nd and 3rd Barons Grey of Codnor (of the 1299 creation) did not properly sit in Parliament after being summoned, and the barony was therefore dated 1397 after evidence was found that Richard Grey, &quot;known as&quot; the fourth Baron, did take his seat in Parliament. The title had fallen into abeyance in 1496 on the death of Henry Grey, &quot;known as&quot; the seventh Baron, and after 493 years was terminated in the favour of Charles Cornwall-Legh , thereafter fifth Baron after the redesignation of title holders. the title is held by his son, the sixth Baron.

The Georgian Cornwall-Legh family seat of High Legh House, Knutsford, Cheshire, was demolished in the 1970s before the peerage was called out of abeyance. The High Legh House name is now used for a smaller building that had been called &quot;The Rood&quot;.

== Baron Grey of Codnor (1397) ==

=== Medieval Barons Grey of Codnor (1299) ===
The following have been historically referred to as holders of this Grey title. During the 1989 abeyance termination proceedings it was deemed that they were summoned to Parliament, but there was no evidence that they sat in a properly constituted Parliament. Having said that there is no reason why a title need be created by a writ of summons, it could also be issued by writ of patent directly from the Sovereign without any necessity for approval of a parliamentary assembly, which at any event were not in a fixed place in 13th and 14th centuries.

* Richard Grey, 2nd Baron Grey of Codnor (–1335)
* John Grey, 3rd Baron Grey of Codnor (1305 or 1311 – 1392).

=== Barons Grey of Codnor (1397) ===

The 1989 termination of the 1496 abeyance held that the barony be dated 1397, as there was evidence the 4th Baron sat in Parliament. The holders of the title from that date were renumbered, with Charles Cornwall-Legh succeeding as the 5th Baron on 30 October 1989.

* Richard Grey, 1st (4th) Baron Grey of Codnor (–1418)
* John Grey, 2nd (5th) Baron Grey of Codnor (1396–1431)
* Henry Grey, 3rd (6th) Baron Grey of Codnor (1406–1444)
* Henry Grey, 4th (7th) Baron Grey of Codnor (1435–1496) (abeyant 1496)
* Charles Legh Shuldham Cornwall-Legh, 5th Baron Grey of Codnor (1903–1996) (abeyance terminated 1989)
* Richard Henry Cornwall-Legh, 6th Baron Grey of Codnor (b. 1936)

The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s son Richard Stephen Cayley Cornwall-Legh (b. 1976).&lt;br&gt;
The heir apparent&#x27;s heir-in-line is his son Caspian Richard Cornwall-Legh (b. 2008)

<doc id="449162" wikidata="Q1854225" url="?curid=449162" title="Rushcliffe">
<text>Rushcliffe is a local government district with borough status in south Nottinghamshire, England. Its council is based in West Bridgford. The borough also includes the towns of Bingham and Cotgrave as well as numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. Some of the built-up areas in the north-west of the borough, including West Bridgford, form part of the Nottingham Urban Area.

The neighbouring districts are Broxtowe, Nottingham, Gedling, Newark and Sherwood, Melton, Charnwood, North West Leicestershire and Erewash.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered the whole area of two former districts and part of a third, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Basford Rural District (part)
*Bingham Rural District
*West Bridgford Urban District
The new district was named after the ancient Rushcliffe Wapentake, which had covered part of the area. Rushcliffe means &quot;cliff where grows&quot;, from Old English &quot;hris&quot; &quot;brushwood&quot; and clif &quot;cliff&quot;. The new Rushcliffe district was granted borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==

Rushcliffe Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Nottinghamshire County Council. Most of the borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Conservative majority control since 1999.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

=== Leadership ===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Rushcliffe. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2005 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:
Of the five independent councillors, three sit together as the &quot;Leake Independents&quot; group and two sit together as the &quot;Bingham Independents&quot; group. The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===

The council is based at the Ruscliffe Arena on Rugby Road in West Bridgford. The building is a combined leisure centre and council headquarters. The council moved into the new building in December 2016 and the leisure centre opened the following month. From 1982 to 2016 the council was based at Rushcliffe Civic Centre on Pavilion Road in West Bridgford, overlooking Trent Bridge. That building had been built in 1966 as a hotel called the Bridgford Hotel.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 44 councillors representing 24 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

=== Wards ===
The wards are:

*Abbey
*Bingham North
*Bingham South
*Bunny
*Compton Acres
*Cotgrave
*Cranmer
*Cropwell
*East Bridgford
*Edwalton
*Gamston
*Gotham
*Keyworth and Wolds
*Lady Bay
*Leake
*Lutterell
*Musters
*Nevile and Langar
*Radcliffe on Trent
*Ruddington
*Soar Valley
*Tollerton
*Trent Bridge
===Wider politics===
The borough straddles two parliamentary constituencies. Most of the borough is in the Rushcliffe constituency. The north-eastern part of the borough around Bingham and surrounding villages is in the Newark constituency.

South-east of Nottingham, the Rushcliffe boundary splits from the City of Nottingham boundary near the Holme Pierrepont Watersports Centre and then follows the River Trent to near RAF Syerston, which is the most northern part of the district, although Syerston the village itself is in the Newark and Sherwood district. It meets the River Devon near Cotham, then follows this river to the east southwards to where it meets the Leicestershire boundary. To the south, the Leicestershire/Rushcliffe boundary crosses the runways of the former RAF Langar with most of the airfield in Rushcliffe.

Rushcliffe is split between an urbanised north-west, containing suburbs of Greater Nottingham that have not been incorporated into the city, and the south and east which is predominantly rural, which stretches to the Leicestershire border. Many of these villages lie in the Vale of Belvoir. The Grantham Canal threads from nearby Grantham through Rushcliffe to the River Trent. Villages in the Vale of Belvoir include Redmile, Hickling, Harby, Stathern and Langar. Geographically, the River Soar marks the divide between the two counties.

==Towns and parishes==

The former West Bridgford Urban District is an unparished area. The rest of the borough is divided into civil parishes. The parish councils for Bingham and Cotgrave take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

==Media==
In terms of television, Rushcliffe is served by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central with television signals received from the Waltham transmitter and the Nottingham relay transmitter.

Radio stations for the area are:
*BBC Radio Nottingham
*Capital Midlands
*Smooth East Midlands
*Greatest Hits Radio Midlands

==Education==
Rushcliffe Spencer Academy and West Bridgford school have ranked regularly in the top 100 comprehensive schools in the UK for GCSE results. In 2014 West Bridgford was ranked at 63rd of all comprehensives in the UK with 83% achieving &#x27;5+ A*-C GCSEs (or equivalent) including English and maths GCSEs&#x27; and Rushcliffe 81st in the UK with 82% achieving 5 A*-C in 2014.

The Becket School (partly geographically outside the Rushcliffe district), West Bridgford School and Rushcliffe Spencer Academy get A level results for &#x27;Average point score per A level student (full-time equivalent)&#x27; in the top 10% of all schools in the UK, comprehensive or selective, better than many English grammar schools. These scores are in the top 2% for all UK comprehensives.

Sutton Bonington is in the south of the district, which has the Sutton Bonington Campus of the University of Nottingham.

<doc id="449163" wikidata="Q1497633" url="?curid=449163" title="Borough of Gedling">
<text>Gedling is a local government district with borough status in Nottinghamshire, England. The council is based in Arnold. The borough also includes Carlton along with villages and rural areas to the north-east of Nottingham. The main built-up part of the borough around Arnold and Carlton forms part of the Nottingham Urban Area.

The neighbouring districts are Ashfield, Newark and Sherwood, Rushcliffe and Nottingham.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered the whole area of two former districts and part of a third, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Arnold Urban District
*Basford Rural District (part, being the parishes of Bestwood Park, Burton Joyce, Calverton, Lambley, Linby, Newstead, Papplewick, Stoke Bardolph and Woodborough)
*Carlton Urban District
The new district was named after the old village of Gedling. The civil parish of Gedling had been abolished in 1935 and absorbed into the Carlton Urban District.

The new Gedling district was granted borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==

Gedling Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Nottinghamshire County Council. Parts of the borough are also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since 2011.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Gedling. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2003 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and changes of allegiance reported in November 2023, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Civic Centre in Arnot Hill Park. The building was purpose-built for the council in 1985 at a cost of £2.2 million. It was formally opened by Princess Anne on 1 November 1985.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2015 the council has comprised 41 councillors representing 19 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

=== Wards ===
The wards are:
*Bestwood St Albans
*Calverton
*Carlton
*Carlton Hill
*Cavendish
*Colwick
*Coppice
*Daybrook
*Dumbles
*Ernehale
*Gedling
*Netherfield
*Newstead Abbey
*Phoenix
*Plains
*Porchester
*Redhill
*Trent Valley
*Woodthorpe
===Parliamentary===
The borough is covered by two parliamentary constituencies. The more urban southern part of the borough adjoining Nottingham is in the Gedling constituency, which until 1983 was known as Carlton. The more rural northern part of the borough, including Calverton and Ravenshead, forms part of the Sherwood constituency.

==Parishes==

There are twelve civil parishes in the borough. The former Arnold Urban District and most of the former Carlton Urban District comprise an unparished area. The parish of Stoke Bardolph has a parish meeting rather than a parish council due to its small population.

*Bestwood Village
*Burton Joyce
*Calverton
*Colwick
*Lambley
*Linby
*Newstead
*Papplewick
*Ravenshead
*St Albans
*Stoke Bardolph
*Woodborough
==Culture==
The Bonington Theatre in Arnold is named after the landscape painter Richard Parkes Bonington.

The borough contains Newstead Abbey, a former Augustinian Priory. The building was converted into a house following the dissolution of the monasteries and was later the seat of the Byron family, including Lord Byron.

==Arms==
==Freedom of the Borough==
The following people and military units have received the Freedom of the Borough of Gedling.

===Individuals===
* Vernon, Lord Coaker: 17 June 2022.

===Military units===
* 2nd Battalion The Mercian Regiment: 20 October 2010.

<doc id="449166" wikidata="Q212130" url="?curid=449166" title="Cyclic permutation">
<text>In mathematics, and in particular in group theory, a cyclic permutation is a permutation consisting of a single cycle. In some cases, cyclic permutations are referred to as cycles; if a cyclic permutation has &quot;k&quot; elements, it may be called a &quot;k&quot;-cycle. Some authors widen this definition to include permutations with fixed points in addition to at most one non-trivial cycle. In cycle notation, cyclic permutations are denoted by the list of their elements enclosed with parentheses, in the order to which they are permuted.

For example, the permutation (1 3 2 4) that sends 1 to 3, 3 to 2, 2 to 4 and 4 to 1 is a 4-cycle, and the permutation (1 3 2)(4) that sends 1 to 3, 3 to 2, 2 to 1 and 4 to 4 is considered a 3-cycle by some authors. On the other hand, the permutation (1 3)(2 4) that sends 1 to 3, 3 to 1, 2 to 4 and 4 to 2 is not a cyclic permutation because it separately permutes the pairs {1, 3} and {2, 4}.

For the wider definition of a cyclic permutation, allowing fixed points, these fixed points each constitute trivial orbits of the permutation, and there is a single non-trivial orbit containing all the remaining points. This can be used as a definition: a cyclic permutation (allowing fixed points) is a permutation that has a single non-trivial orbit. Every permutation on finitely many elements can be decomposed into cyclic permutations whose non-trivial orbits are disjoint.

The individual cyclic parts of a permutation are also called [[Cycles and fixed points|cycles]], thus the second example is composed of a 3-cycle and a 1-cycle (or &quot;fixed point&quot;) and the third is composed of two 2-cycles.

== Definition ==
There is not widespread consensus about the precise definition of a cyclic permutation. Some authors define a permutation of a set to be cyclic if &quot;successive application would take each object of the permuted set successively through the positions of all the other objects&quot;, or, equivalently, if its representation in cycle notation consists of a single cycle. Others provide a more permissive definition which allows fixed points.

A nonempty subset of is a &quot;cycle&quot; of formula_1 if the restriction of formula_1 to is a cyclic permutation of . If is finite, its cycles are disjoint, and their union is . That is, they form a partition, called the cycle decomposition of formula_3 So, according to the more permissive definition, a permutation of is cyclic if and only if is its unique cycle.

For example, the permutation, written in cycle notation and two-line notation (in two ways) as
:formula_4
has one 6-cycle and two 1-cycles its cycle diagram is shown at right. Some authors consider this permutation cyclic while others do not.

With the enlarged definition, there are cyclic permutations that do not consist of a single cycle. 

More formally, for the enlarged definition, a permutation formula_1 of a set &quot;X&quot;, viewed as a bijective function formula_6, is called a cycle if the action on &quot;X&quot; of the subgroup generated by formula_1 has at most one orbit with more than a single element. This notion is most commonly used when &quot;X&quot; is a finite set; then the largest orbit, &quot;S&quot;, is also finite. Let formula_8 be any element of &quot;S&quot;, and put formula_9 for any formula_10. If &quot;S&quot; is finite, there is a minimal number formula_11 for which formula_12. Then formula_13, and formula_1 is the permutation defined by

:formula_15 for 0 ≤ &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;k&quot;

and formula_16 for any element of formula_17. The elements not fixed by formula_1 can be pictured as

:formula_19.

A cyclic permutation can be written using the compact cycle notation formula_20 (there are no commas between elements in this notation, to avoid confusion with a &quot;k&quot;-tuple). The &quot;length&quot; of a cycle is the number of elements of its largest orbit. A cycle of length &quot;k&quot; is also called a &quot;k&quot;-cycle.

The orbit of a 1-cycle is called a &quot;fixed point&quot; of the permutation, but as a permutation every 1-cycle is the identity permutation. When cycle notation is used, the 1-cycles are often omitted when no confusion will result.

== Basic properties ==

One of the basic results on symmetric groups is that any permutation can be expressed as the product of disjoint cycles (more precisely: cycles with disjoint orbits); such cycles commute with each other, and the expression of the permutation is unique up to the order of the cycles. The multiset of lengths of the cycles in this expression (the cycle type) is therefore uniquely determined by the permutation, and both the signature and the conjugacy class of the permutation in the symmetric group are determined by it.

The number of &quot;k&quot;-cycles in the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; is given, for formula_21, by the following equivalent formulas:
formula_22

A &quot;k&quot;-cycle has signature (−1)&quot;k&quot; − 1.

The inverse of a cycle formula_20 is given by reversing the order of the entries: formula_24. In particular, since formula_25, every two-cycle is its own inverse. Since disjoint cycles commute, the inverse of a product of disjoint cycles is the result of reversing each of the cycles separately.

== Transpositions ==
A cycle with only two elements is called a transposition. For example, the permutation formula_26 that swaps 2 and 4. Since it is a 2-cycle, it can be written as formula_27.

=== Properties ===
Any permutation can be expressed as the composition (product) of transpositions—formally, they are generators for the group. In fact, when the set being permuted is for some integer , then any permutation can be expressed as a product of formula_28 and so on. This follows because an arbitrary transposition can be expressed as the product of adjacent transpositions. Concretely, one can express the transposition formula_29 where formula_30 by moving to one step at a time, then moving back to where was, which interchanges these two and makes no other changes:

:formula_31

The decomposition of a permutation into a product of transpositions is obtained for example by writing the permutation as a product of disjoint cycles, and then splitting iteratively each of the cycles of length 3 and longer into a product of a transposition and a cycle of length one less:

:formula_32

This means the initial request is to move formula_33 to formula_34 formula_35 to formula_36 formula_37 to formula_38 and finally formula_39 to formula_40 Instead one may roll the elements keeping formula_33 where it is by executing the right factor first (as usual in operator notation, and following the convention in the article Permutation). This has moved formula_39 to the position of formula_34 so after the first permutation, the elements formula_33 and formula_39 are not yet at their final positions. The transposition formula_46 executed thereafter, then addresses formula_39 by the index of formula_35 to swap what initially were formula_33 and formula_50

In fact, the symmetric group is a Coxeter group, meaning that it is generated by elements of order 2 (the adjacent transpositions), and all relations are of a certain form.

One of the main results on symmetric groups states that either all of the decompositions of a given permutation into transpositions have an even number of transpositions, or they all have an odd number of transpositions. This permits the parity of a permutation to be a well-defined concept.

<doc id="449168" wikidata="Q1776967" url="?curid=449168" title="South Oxfordshire">
<text>South Oxfordshire is a local government district in the ceremonial county of Oxfordshire, England. Its council is temporarily based outside the district at Abingdon-on-Thames pending a planned move to Didcot, the district&#x27;s largest town. The areas located south of the River Thames are within the historic county of Berkshire.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of six former districts, which were abolished at the same time:
*Bullingdon Rural District
*Henley-on-Thames Municipal Borough
*Henley Rural District
*Thame Urban District
*Wallingford Municipal Borough
*Wallingford Rural District
The two Wallingford districts had previously been part of the administrative county of Berkshire, whilst the other four districts had been in the administrative county of Oxfordshire. The new district was originally given the name &quot;Wallingford&quot;. The shadow authority elected in 1973 to oversee the transition requested a change of name to &quot;South Oxfordshire&quot;, which was approved by the government before the new district formally came into being in 1974.

==Geography==
The River Thames flows for approximately 47 miles through South Oxfordshire, forming the historic county boundary between Berkshire and Oxfordshire. It is also joined by the River Thame within the district. A characteristic of the rivers within the district is that they have wide floodplains with few houses on them so that fluvial flooding is a lesser problem than flash flooding. Towns in the district are Didcot, Henley-on-Thames, Thame, Wallingford and Watlington.

==Villages==
:&quot;See List of civil parishes in South Oxfordshire
The larger villages in the district include:
*Benson
*Berinsfield
*Chalgrove
*Chinnor
*Cholsey
*Dorchester
*Ewelme
*Goring-on-Thames
*Lewknor
*Shiplake
*Sonning Common
*Wheatley

==Population change and distribution==

The 2001 Census recorded a population of just over 128,000 in the district. This was an increase of 7% since 1991. By the 2021 Census, the figure had risen to over 149,000.

Much of the district is rural in nature, with the land in agricultural use and around 70% of the district has a green belt or AONB designation (The northeast of the district forms part of the Oxford Green Belt). 50% of the district&#x27;s population lives outside its four main towns of Didcot, Henley-on-Thames, Thame and Wallingford.
==Governance==
South Oxfordshire District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Oxfordshire County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

Since 2008, the council has shared staff with neighbouring Vale of White Horse District Council.

===Political control===
The Liberal Democrats have held a majority of the seats on the council since the 2023 election. Despite having a majority, they form a joint administration with the Green Party, continuing a coalition which they had formed in 2019 when the council had been under no overall control.

The first election to the district council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2003 have been:
===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last full review of boundaries in 2015, the council has comprised 36 councillors representing 21 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council was initially based in various premises across the district in Henley, Thame, Wheatley, Wallingford and Didcot inherited from its predecessor authorities. In 1981 the council moved to a purpose-built headquarters on Benson Lane, Crowmarsh Gifford, near Wallingford.

On 15 January 2015, an arson attack destroyed the district council&#x27;s main offices in Crowmarsh Gifford. As the fire started in the early hours of the morning there were no fatalities or injuries. Immediately after the fire, the council was temporarily based in Abingdon, in the neighbouring Vale of White Horse district. From later in 2015 until 2022 the council was based at Milton Park, sharing a building with Vale of White Horse District Council. The Council initially intended to return to Crowmarsh, but in October 2020 it was announced that both councils plan on relocating to a new building in Didcot, to be built on a site known as Didcot Gateway opposite Didcot Parkway railway station, aiming for completion in 2023. In 2022 the councils vacated Milton Park and returned to Abingdon, again on a temporary basis, whilst waiting for the Didcot Gateway scheme to be ready.

==Media==
In terms of television, the area is served by BBC South and ITV Meridian broadcast from the Oxford transmitter. However, southern parts of the district which includes Henley-on-Thames is served by BBC London and ITV London broadcasting from the Crystal Palace transmitter. 

Radio stations for the area are BBC Radio Oxford, BBC Radio Berkshire (covering Henley-on-Thames), Heart South, and Greatest Hits Radio.

Local newspapers are &quot;Oxfordshire Guardian&quot;, &quot;Oxford Mail&quot; and &quot;Henley Standard&quot;.

==Recycling==
South Oxfordshire has consistently one of the best recycling rates in England, coming top of the league table of the percentage of waste sent for recycling, reuse or composting in 2022/23. The local authority has been placed near the top of the league table for over a decade.

==Energy consumption==
In May 2006, a report commissioned by British Gas showed that housing in South Oxfordshire produced the 5th highest average carbon emissions in the country at 7,356 kg of carbon dioxide per dwelling.

<text>West Oxfordshire is a local government district in northwest Oxfordshire, England, including towns such as Woodstock, Burford, Chipping Norton, Charlbury, Carterton and Witney, where the council is based.

==Area==
The area is mainly rural downland and forest, with the main economic activities being farming and associated trades. West Oxfordshire lies within the River Thames catchment area, with the Thames itself and its tributaries including the River Evenlode and River Windrush running through the area. Parts of the district suffered severe flooding during the 2007 floods in the UK. Some areas of the district lie within the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

==History==
West Oxfordshire district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of five former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Chipping Norton Municipal Borough
*Chipping Norton Rural District
*Witney Rural District
*Witney Urban District
*Woodstock Municipal Borough

The new district was named West Oxfordshire, describing its location within the wider county.

==Governance==

Oxfordshire has a two-tier structure of local government, with the five district councils (including West Oxfordshire District Council) providing district-level services, and Oxfordshire County Council providing county-level services. There is also a third tier of local government in West Oxfordshire of civil parishes.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2022 election. The Liberal Democrats subsequently formed an administration with Labour and the Greens, with Liberal Democrat Andy Graham becoming the leader of the council. The same coalition continued following both the 2023 and 2024 elections.

The first election to the district council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2001 have been:
===Composition===
Following the 2024 election and the November 2024 Chipping Norton by-election, the council&#x27;s political make-up was:
The next election is due in 2026.

===Elections===
{{also|West Oxfordshire District Council elections}}
Since the last full review of boundaries in 2002, the council has comprised 49 councillors representing 27 wards. Elections are held in three out of every four years, with one third of the seats on the council being elected at each election. Oxfordshire County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no district council elections.

===Premises===
The council is based at the former Witney Rural District Council offices on Woodgreen in Witney. The building was built as a large house in 1887 for one of the town&#x27;s blanket manufacturers, and was originally known as Springfield, 39 Woodgreen. The building was acquired by Witney Rural District Council around 1966 and is now known as Council Offices, Woodgreen.

==Towns and parishes==
{{further|List of civil parishes in Oxfordshire}}
The whole district is covered by civil parishes. The parishes of Burford, Carterton, Charlbury, Chipping Norton, Witney, and Woodstock have been declared towns and their parish councils therefore take the style &#x27;town council&#x27;. Bampton is a post town, but has a parish council rather than a town council.

<text>John Arthur Cunliffe (16 June 1933 – 20 September 2018) was an English children&#x27;s book author and television presenter who created the characters of &quot;Postman Pat&quot; and co-wrote and presented the first two series of &quot;Rosie and Jim&quot;.

==Early life==
John Arthur Cunliffe was born in Colne, Lancashire on 16 June 1933, the only child of Nelly and Arthur Cunliffe. His father left the family when John was a baby. His great-uncle Herbert introduced him to the literary works of Charles Dickens and William Shakespeare, and let him use the microscope he kept in his front room. Cunliffe was very tall for his age, and bullied at school because of this. He attended Colne Grammar School, and later lived in Kendal, Westmorland, where the area&#x27;s small towns and villages provided inspiration for his most famous character, Postman Pat. Greendale, where the series is set, is based on Longsleddale. Although Cunliffe wanted to become a writer when he left school, he was unsure how to go about this and from 1951 to 1973 was employed mainly as a librarian, including two years spent working for the British Council in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. From 1955 to 1956, he drove a van as a mobile librarian in rural Northumberland, and drew on this experience when creating &quot;Postman Pat&quot;.

After deciding to change career, in 1975 Cunliffe obtained a Certificate in Education from the Charlotte Mason College of Education in Ambleside, Cumbria, and taught at Castle Park Primary School in Kendal. He later worked for Manchester Education Committee as a visiting teacher/advisor on children&#x27;s books. From 1981 to 1985 he was deputy head teacher at Crowcroft Park Primary School in Manchester, following which he had a part-time job at Manchester Teacher&#x27;s Centre promoting the use of computers in primary schools.

==Writing career== 

===&quot;Postman Pat&quot;===

Cunliffe&#x27;s first book, &quot;Farmer Barnes Buys a Pig&quot;, was published in 1964 through contact with children&#x27;s author and publishing editor Philippa Pearce. In 1979, whilst teaching in Kendal, he applied unsuccessfully for a director&#x27;s job on the BBC TV programme &quot;Play School&quot;, but at lunch following the interview was asked if he could write a 13-part series for children set in the countryside. This resulted in the creation of &quot;Postman Pat&quot;, which was animated and directed by Ivor Wood, and first broadcast on 16 September 1981. He created Pat and Greendale as an idyllic village where everyone was nice to each other, in contrast to the bullying he suffered while growing up. Following the success of &quot;Postman Pat&quot;, Cunliffe became something of a local celebrity, and had a room dedicated to him at Kendal&#x27;s Museum of Lakeland Life. Until 1986, he received limited income from libraries through the Public Lending Right scheme, for which most of his books did not qualify being under 32 pages long.

===&quot;Rosie and Jim&quot;===

Cunliffe&#x27;s other well-known project, &quot;Rosie and Jim&quot;, was shown on ITV from 1990 to 2000. He co-wrote and presented the first 50 episodes, then turned some of them into books also writing three new stories not in the TV show. He intended to create a series closer to what he wanted overall, after being disappointed by some of the merchandising and tie-in books for &quot;Postman Pat&quot;, over which he had little control. His role as presenter was taken over by Pat Hutchins in 1995, and later by Neil Brewer in 1997.

===Other work===

In 2010, he released &quot;Ghosts&quot;, a children&#x27;s story for the iPad. He was patron of the Ilkley Literature Festival.

==Personal life and death==

Cunliffe married Sylvia May Thompson in 1960, and the couple had one son, Julian Edward. They lived at 32 Greenside in Kendal when they first came to the Lake District. Cunliffe was a keen fan of Alfred Wainwright, another Kendal resident, and annotated his copies of Wainwright&#x27;s books after completing particular walks. Despite the success of &quot;Postman Pat&quot;, when interviewed in 1987, Cunliffe and his wife were still living in their &quot;modest semi-detached house&quot; in the Manchester suburb of Withington, and for two and a half days a week he was working as an advisor to City of Manchester Education Committee on the use of computers in schools.

Cunliffe died of cardiopulmanory failure in Ilkley on 20 September 2018, at the age of 85. His death was first announced in the local newspaper, the &quot;Ilkley Gazette&quot;, which said he &quot;left his Ilkley home in a deluge of rain [...] never to return&quot;.

<text>North Shropshire was a local government district in Shropshire, England from 1974 to 2009. The district council was based at Edinburgh House in Wem. Other settlements included the towns of Ellesmere, Market Drayton and Whitchurch, as well as the large villages of Shawbury and Baschurch. The district bordered onto Wales, Cheshire and Staffordshire as well as the Shropshire districts of Oswestry, Shrewsbury and Atcham and the unitary Telford and Wrekin.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by a merger of Market Drayton Rural District and North Shropshire Rural District.

The district and its council were abolished on 1 April 2009, when the new Shropshire Council unitary authority was established, as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England.

==Settlements==
The district council classified Wem, Market Drayton, Whitchurch and Ellesmere as the market towns of North Shropshire, while it gave the classification of &quot;main service villages&quot; to Baschurch, Cheswardine, Clive, Cockshutt, Dudleston Heath, Hadnall, Hinstock, Hodnet, Prees, Shawbury, Tilstock, Welshampton and Woore. The district also included many other smaller villages and hamlets.

==Infrastructure==
The main roads in the district were the A41, A49 and the A53. There were no motorways.

There were four railway stations in the district: (Yorton, Wem, Prees and Whitchurch), all on the Welsh Marches Line. The Shrewsbury to Chester Line ran through the district as well, but the only station on that section of the line within North Shropshire had been at Baschurch, which had closed in 1965, prior to the district&#x27;s creation. The Shropshire Union Canal and Ellesmere Canal/Llangollen Canal both ran through the district.

==Political control==
The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 2009 was held by the following parties:

===Leadership===
The last leader of the council was David Minnery, a Conservative.

<doc id="449180" wikidata="Q1853334" url="?curid=449180" title="Taunton Deane">
<text>Taunton Deane was a local government district with borough status in Somerset, England. Its council was based in Taunton.

The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by a merger of the Municipal Borough of Taunton, Wellington Urban District, Taunton Rural District, and Wellington Rural District.

Taunton Deane was granted borough status in 1975, perpetuating the mayoralty of Taunton.

The district was given the name of an alternative form of the Taunton Deane Hundred.

In September 2016, West Somerset and Taunton Deane councils agreed in principle to merge the districts into one (with one council) subject to consultation. The new district would not be a unitary authority, with Somerset County Council still performing its functions. In March 2018 both councils voted in favour of the merger and it came into effect on 1 April 2019, with the first elections to the new council in May 2019. The new district was known as Somerset West and Taunton.

==Governance==

The district was governed by Taunton Deane Borough Council, and had periods of both Conservative and Liberal Democrat control, as well as times under no overall control. At the final election in 2015, the Conservatives gained an increased majority on the council.

==Settlements==

Settlements in bold have a town charter or a population over 2,500.

==Parishes==
Part of the former Taunton Municipal Borough is unparished.

==Demography==

The town of Taunton (which for population estimates includes the unparished area - or former municipal borough - plus the neighbouring parishes of Bishop&#x27;s Hull, Comeytrowe, Norton Fitzwarren, Staplegrove, Trull and West Monkton) had an estimated population of 61,400 in 2001.

Taunton formed part of the larger borough of Taunton Deane which also includes the town of Wellington and surrounding villages. Taunton Deane had an estimated population of 102,600 in 2001.

The figures below are for the Taunton Deane area.

==Education==

County schools (those which are not independent) in the five non-metropolitan districts of the county were operated by Somerset County Council, or are independent of the council and run as academies.

<text>A chain store or retail chain is a retail outlet in which several locations share a brand, central management and standardized business practices. They have come to dominate many retail markets, dining markets, and service categories in many parts of the world. A franchise retail establishment is one form of a chain store. In 2005, the world&#x27;s largest retail chain, Walmart, became the world&#x27;s largest corporation based on gross sales.

==History==

In 1792, Henry Walton Smith and his wife Anna established W.H. Smith as a news vending business in London that would become a national concern in the mid-19th century under the management of their grandson William Henry Smith. The world&#x27;s oldest national retail chain, the firm took advantage of the railway boom during the Industrial Revolution by opening news-stands at railway stations beginning in 1848. The firm, now called WHSmith, had more than 1,400 locations as of 2017.

In the U.S., chain stores likely began with J. Stiner &amp; Company, which operated several tea shops in New York City around 1860. By 1900, George Huntington Hartford had built The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, originally a tea distributor based in New York, into a grocery chain that operated almost 200 stores. Dozens of other grocery, drug, tobacco, and variety stores opened additional locations, around the same time, so that retail chains were common in the United States by 1910. Several state legislatures considered measures to restrict the growth of chains, and in 1914 concern about chain stores contributed to passage of the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Clayton Antitrust Act.

Isidore, Benjamin and Modeste Dewachter originated the idea of the chain department store in Belgium in 1868, ten years before A&amp;P began offering more than coffee and tea. They started with four locations for &quot;Maisons Dewachter&quot; (Houses of Dewachter): La Louvière, Mons, Namur and Leuze. They later incorporated as &quot;Dewachter frères&quot; (Dewachter Brothers) on January 1, 1875. The brothers offered ready-to-wear clothing for men and children and specialty clothing such as riding apparel and beachwear. Isidore owned 51% of the company, while his brothers split the remaining 49%. Under Isidore&#x27;s (and later his son Louis&#x27;) leadership, &quot;Maisons Dewachter&quot; would become one of the most recognized names in Belgium and France with stores in 20 cities and towns. Some cities had multiple stores, such as Bordeaux, France. Louis Dewachter also became an internationally known landscape artist, painting under the pseudonym Louis Dewis.

By the early 1920s, chain retailing was well established in the United States, with A&amp;P, Woolworth&#x27;s, American Stores, and United Cigar Stores being the largest. By the 1930s, chain stores had come of age, and stopped increasing their total market share. Court decisions against the chains&#x27; price-cutting appeared as early as 1906, and laws against chain stores began in the 1920s, along with legal countermeasures by chain-store groups. State taxes on chain stores were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1931. Between then and 1933, 525 chain-store tax bills were introduced in state legislatures, and by the end of 1933 special taxes on retail chains were in force in 17 states.

==Characteristics==
A chain store is characterised by the ownership or franchise relationship between the local business or outlet and a controlling business.

===Difference between a &quot;chain&quot; and formula retail===
While chains are typically &quot;formula retail&quot;, a chain refers to ownership or franchise, whereas &quot;formula retail&quot; or &quot;formula business&quot; refers to the characteristics of the business. There is considerable overlap because key characteristic of a formula retail business is that it is controlled as a part of a business relationship, and is generally part of a chain. Nevertheless, most codified municipal regulation relies on definitions of formula retail (e.g., formula restaurants), in part because a restriction directed to &quot;chains&quot; may be deemed an impermissible restriction on interstate commerce (in the US), or as exceeding municipal zoning authority (i.e., regulating &quot;who owns it&quot; rather than the characteristics of the business). Non-codified restrictions will sometimes target &quot;chains&quot;. A municipal ordinance may seek to prohibit &quot;formula businesses&quot; in order to maintain the character of a community and support local businesses that serve the surrounding neighborhood.

===Decline===

Brick-and-mortar chain stores have been in decline as retail has shifted to online shopping, leading to historically high retail vacancy rates. The hundred-year-old Radio Shack chain went from 7,400 stores in 2001 to 400 stores in 2018. FYE is the last remaining music chain store in the United States and has shrunk from over 1,000 at its height to 270 locations in 2018. In 2019, Payless ShoeSource stated that it would be closing all remaining 2,100 stores in the US.

==Restaurant chains==
A restaurant chain is a set of related restaurants in many different locations that are either under shared corporate ownership or franchising agreements. Typically, the restaurants within a chain are built to a standard format through architectural prototype development and offer a standard menu and/or services. Fast food restaurants are the most common, but sit-down restaurant chains also exist. Restaurant chains locations are often found near highways, shopping malls and densely populated urban or tourist areas.

=== Britain ===
In 1896, Samuel Isaacs from Whitechapel, east London opened the first fish and chips restaurant (as opposed to a take-away) in London, and its instant popularity led to a chain comprising 22 restaurants with locations around London and seaside resorts in southern England including Brighton, Ramsgate and Margate. In 1864, the Aerated Bread Company (ABC) began operating a chain of teashops in Britain. ABC would be overtaken as the leader in the field by Lyons, co-founded by Joseph Lyons in 1884. From 1909 Lyons began operating a chain of teashops which became a staple of the High Street in the UK, and at its peak, the firm numbered around 200 cafes.

==Opposition==

The displacement of independent businesses by chains has sparked increased collaboration among independent businesses and communities to prevent chain proliferation. These efforts include community-based organizing through Independent Business Alliances (in the U.S. and Canada) and &quot;buy local&quot; campaigns. In the U.S., trade organizations such as the American Booksellers Association and American Specialty Toy Retailers do national promotion and advocacy. NGOs like the New Rules Project and New Economics Foundation provide research and tools for pro-independent business education and policy while the American Independent Business Alliance provides direct assistance for community-level organizing.

==Regulation and exclusion==
A variety of towns and cities in the United States whose residents wish to retain their distinctive character—such as San Francisco; Provincetown, Massachusetts and other Cape Cod villages; Bristol, RI; McCall, Idaho; Port Townsend, Washington; Ogunquit, Maine; Windermere, Florida and Carmel-by-the-Sea, California—closely regulate, even exclude, chain stores. They don&#x27;t exclude the chain itself, only the standardized formula the chain uses, described as &quot;formula businesses&quot;. For example, there could often be a restaurant owned by McDonald&#x27;s that sells hamburgers, but not the formula franchise operation with the golden arches and standardized menu, uniforms, and procedures. The reason these towns regulate chain stores is aesthetics and tourism. Proponents of formula restaurants and formula retail allege the restrictions are used to protect independent businesses from competition.

<text>West Somerset was a local government district in the English county of Somerset from 1974 to 2019. The council covered a largely rural area, with a population of 34,900 in an area of ; it was the least populous non-unitary district in England. According to figures released by the Office for National Statistics in 2009, the population of West Somerset had the oldest average age in the United Kingdom at 52. The largest centres of population were the coastal towns of Minehead (population 10,000) and Watchet (4,400).

The council&#x27;s administrative headquarters were located in the village of Williton, with an additional office in Minehead.

In September 2016, West Somerset and Taunton Deane councils agreed in principle to merge the districts into one (with one council) subject to consultation. The new district would not be a unitary authority: it would still be part of the Somerset County Council area. In March 2018 both councils voted in favour of the merger and it came into effect on 1 April 2019, with the first elections to the new council in May 2019. The new authority was known as Somerset West and Taunton Council.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by a merger of the previous urban districts of Minehead and Watchet, along with Dulverton Rural District and Williton Rural District.

===Listed buildings===
There were 33 Grade I listed buildings in West Somerset: the oldest are Culbone Church (one of the smallest churches in England, and pre-Norman in origin) and Tarr Steps, which some say originates in the Bronze Age, although others date them from around 1400. Dunster has the greatest concentration of Grade I listed buildings including Dunster Castle, the Yarn Market, Gallox Bridge and Priory Church of St George. Other sites include manor houses such as Nettlecombe Court and Orchard Wyndham. The most recent buildings included in the list are Crowcombe Court which was completed in 1739 and the Church of St John the Baptist in Carhampton which was rebuilt in 1863. There are numerous religious structures in Somerset, with the largest number being Anglican parish churches, dating from Norman or medieval eras. Some of the churches are included in the Somerset towers, a collection of distinctive, mostly spireless Gothic church towers.
===Financial difficulties===
In 2012 financial difficulties at the council, including a £1 million reduction over three years, lead to plans to outsource most of the services provided to the population and make most of the staff redundant. It was proposed that some services may be shared with Taunton Deane council. In December 2012 the grant received from central government was increased by 0.9% meaning the council had £3.8million to spend on the provision of services.

==Geography==
West Somerset benefits from one of the most scenic landscapes in England. Nearly two-thirds of the western land area of the district forms part of Exmoor National Park, designated in 1954, while on the eastern edge of the district are the Quantock Hills, which in 1956 became the first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty created in the UK. Large areas of Exmoor and the Quantock Hills are also designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest because of their value for wildlife.

The West Somerset Railway runs through most of the district, from Bishop&#x27;s Lydeard in the south east to Minehead in the north west. Operated mainly as a tourist attraction, the railway runs mostly steam and some diesel locomotives.

==Governance==

West Somerset District Council was elected every four years, with 28 councillors being elected at each election. From the first election to the council in 1973 to the 1995 election the council had a majority of independents. Since then the Conservative Party won a majority at the 2003 election, but independents took a majority back at the 2007 election. Following the election in 2011 the Conservatives regained a majority, which they then held until the council&#x27;s abolition in 2019.

<text>Jordin John Kudluk Tootoo (; born February 2, 1983) is a Canadian former professional hockey player, who played for the Nashville Predators, Detroit Red Wings, New Jersey Devils and Chicago Blackhawks. Of Inuit, Ukrainian and English descent, he is the first Inuk player to play in the National Hockey League (NHL). Tootoo was widely regarded as one of the NHL&#x27;s best agitators and was able to annoy, fight, and outplay other players to help his team win. At the end of the 2016–17 NHL season, Tootoo had accumulated 65 goals, 96 assists and 1010 PIMs in 723 career NHL games since entering the league in 2003.

In addition to his on-ice skills, Tootoo is known for his charity and community outreach work, especially in northern communities.

On October 19, 2018, he officially announced his retirement on Twitter, saying &quot;After 220 regular-season games with the Wheat Kings and 723 games in the NHL I have decided to retire from the NHL to focus on giving back to the Indigenous community.&quot;

==Playing career==
===Nashville Predators===
Tootoo was 13 years old when he moved from Rankin Inlet to go play Bantam AAA hockey in Spruce Grove, Alberta. The Brandon Wheat Kings selected him in the 3rd round of the 1998 WHL Bantam Draft. Tootoo played for the Wheat Kings in the Western Hockey League (WHL) from 1999 to 2003 and was selected 98th overall in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft as the sixth choice of the Nashville Predators. He became the first player of Inuit descent to play in a regular-season NHL game when he suited up against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim on Opening Night October 9, 2003. He was also the first person of Inuit descent to be drafted by an NHL team. Tootoo wears the number &#x27;22&#x27; as a play on words of his name.

Tootoo got his first NHL point with an assist on a Dan Hamhuis goal against the St. Louis Blues on October 16, 2003 and scored his first NHL goal against the Atlanta Thrashers on October 23. Tootoo has also earned two &quot;Gordie Howe hat tricks&quot;on January 10, 2004, and December 8, 2007when he notched a goal, an assist, and a fighting major in each game.

He spent the 2005–06 season between the Nashville Predators and the Predators&#x27; minor league affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals, where he played during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. On July 21, 2006, he was re-signed by the Predators to a two-year contract. On January 31, 2008, he was re-signed to another two-year contract extension.

Tootoo scored his first playoff goal on April 10, 2008, against the Detroit Red Wings in the second period of Game 1 of the 2008 Western Conference Quarter Finals in a 3–1 loss.

Tootoo currently holds the franchise record for total penalty minutes (725) with Nashville. Over his 486 games with the Predators, Tootoo recorded 46 goals and 79 assists for a combined total of 125 points during his eight years (2003—2012) with the Predators.

On February 2, 2019, the Nashville Predators held &quot;Jordin Tootoo Night&quot; at Bridgestone Arena, hosting the Dallas Stars. Tootoo spoke with the media and participated in the pregame puck drop.

===Detroit Red Wings===

Tootoo was designated an unrestricted free agent after the 2011–12 season. He signed a three-year, $5.7 million contract with the Detroit Red Wings, Nashville&#x27;s Central Division rival on July 1, 2012. He scored his first goal as a Red Wing against his former team, the Predators on February 19, 2013.

On June 18, 2014, the Red Wings placed Tootoo on unconditional waivers for the purpose of a compliance buyout.

=== New Jersey Devils ===
Tootoo attended the training camp for the New Jersey Devils on a tryout basis and signed a one-year contract with the team on October 7, 2014. He played with the team for 68 games during the 2014–15 season. He scored 10 goals, had 5 assists, and sat for 72 PIM ranking 55th most penalty minutes in the NHL. On May 8, 2015, he was re-signed to a second one-year $825,000 contract.

===Chicago Blackhawks and retirement===
As a free agent on July 5, 2016, Tootoo left the Devils to sign a one-year contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. On February 28, 2017, Chicago agreed to extend Tootoo&#x27;s contract through the 2017–2018 season. In his year with the Chicago Blackhawks, he was nursing an upper body injury and placed on long term injury reserve which resulted in him being waived in November 2017.

On October 19, 2018, Tootoo retired from hockey after playing 723 NHL games. Despite his retirement, Tootoo said he plans to &quot;continue to work to enhance life for Native children who are suffering.&quot;

==Suspensions and disciplinary issues==
Tootoo faced NHL disciplinary action on multiple occasions for his actions. On March 17, 2007, Tootoo punched defenceman Stéphane Robidas of the Dallas Stars in the face during a game. Robidas was knocked unconscious and suffered a concussion. Two days later the NHL issued Tootoo a five-game suspension without pay, and accusations of &quot;dirty&quot; play were leveled. These accusations were resurrected after an incident on October 11, 2007, in which Tootoo hit the head of Daniel Winnik of the Phoenix Coyotes with his shoulder.

On December 6, 2011, the NHL suspended Tootoo again, this time for two games, as a result of a charging incident against Buffalo Sabres&#x27; goaltender Ryan Miller in a game played on December 3, 2011. The incident occurred after Nashville&#x27;s own GM, David Poile, publicly supported league action to prevent such hits on goaltenders.

Columbus Blue Jackets&#x27; forward Derek Dorsett accused Tootoo of throwing a sucker punch at him during a game on February 20, 2013.

==Personal life==
Jordin Tootoo&#x27;s older brother Terence played for the Roanoke Express of the ECHL in the 2001–02 season. Terence had a successful junior career with the OCN Blizzard, and was named the Express&#x27; Rookie of the Year. In August 2002, Terence died by suicide at the age of 22, in the wake of an arrest for drunk driving.

Tootoo&#x27;s middle name, &quot;Kudluk&quot;, means &quot;thunder&quot; in Inuktitut. Jordin&#x27;s mother Rose (&quot;née&quot; Harrison) is of English and Ukrainian descent, while his father Barney is an Inuk from Nunavut.

He is the paternal nephew of the former Manitoba Legislative Assembly Speaker George Hickes and cousin to former Nunavut Legislative Assembly Speaker and former federal minister Hunter Tootoo.

Although born in Manitoba, Tootoo grew up in Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, where he was taught to skate and play hockey by his father. Growing up in Rankin Inlet allowed Tootoo to learn the traditional Inuit lifestyle that includes hunting and camping, but also exposed him to mental and physical abuse. As the first Inuk to play in the National Hockey League he has become a role model for youth in Nunavut.

In 2007, Tootoo was in a relationship with former &quot;American Idol&quot; contestant and country music singer Kellie Pickler. Tootoo brought Pickler to his hometown of Rankin Inlet. The relationship ended that summer, due to Tootoo&#x27;s infidelity. It is widely believed that Pickler&#x27;s single &quot;Best Days of Your Life&quot; was written about Tootoo.

On December 27, 2010, Tootoo voluntarily entered the NHL/NHLPA&#x27;s Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health Program to receive treatment for an alcohol problem. Following successful completion of the program, he returned to finish the season and play in the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs.

In 2012 during the NHL hockey lockout Jordin Tootoo went to his home town of Rankin Inlet, Nunavut to host the first Team Tootoo hockey camp for the local kids. Tootoo&#x27;s main focus of the camp was making sure the kids were having fun and being able to enjoy themselves as a community. &quot;It’s going to be a really positive atmosphere. You’re going to learn hockey skills, but you’re also going to learn life skills and teamwork,&quot; he said.

In 2013 Stephen Brunt mentioned on radio that he was working on a book with Tootoo. The book was published on October 21, 2014, entitled &quot;All The Way: My Life on Ice&quot;.

==Team Tootoo Foundation==
In 2015 the New Jersey Devils nominated Tootoo for the 2015 NHL Foundation Player Award. This award is designated to a player that exhibits valued characteristics to the NHL; commitment, perseverance and teamwork. The player that is selected is granted 25,000 dollars to a foundation of their choice, which ended up being the kickstart to his foundation. Tootoo&#x27;s recognition comes from all the work his Team Tootoo Foundation has done in his hometown of Rankin Inlet, Nunavut and nationally. The inspiration that motivated Tootoo to start his foundation in 2011 was the suicide of his older brother Terence back in 2002. The main focus of The Team Tootoo Fund is to raise awareness for suicide prevention and anti-bullying programs for youths at risk. Having dealt with mental illness and suicide himself in the past he has been a positive voice for individuals struggling with these afflictions, often speaking out and sharing his story.

==International play==



Tootoo represented Canada at the 2003 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where he recorded two goals and one assist in six games, and won a silver medal.

<doc id="449192" wikidata="Q2116379" url="?curid=449192" title="South Staffordshire">
<text>South Staffordshire is a local government district in Staffordshire, England. Its council is based in Codsall. Other notable settlements include Brewood, Cheslyn Hay, Coven, Essington, Featherstone, Four Ashes, Great Wyrley, Huntington, Kinver, Landywood, Penkridge, Perton, Wedges Mills, Weston-under-Lizard and Wombourne. The district covers a largely rural area lying immediately to the west and north-west of the West Midlands conurbation.

The neighbouring districts are Stafford, Cannock Chase, Walsall, Wolverhampton, Dudley, Bromsgrove, Wyre Forest, Shropshire and Telford and Wrekin.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered two former districts, which were both abolished at the same time:
*Cannock Rural District
*Seisdon Rural District
The new district was named South Staffordshire, reflecting its position within the wider county.

==Governance==
South Staffordshire District Council, which styles itself &quot;South Staffordshire Council&quot;, provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Staffordshire County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Conservative majority control since 1976.

The first elections were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1982 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 42 councillors representing 20 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

The district covers a similar geographic area to South Staffordshire parliamentary constituency, although the north of the district is covered by the Stafford constituency. Sir Patrick Cormack of the Conservative Party held the South Staffordshire seat, and its predecessor, Staffordshire South-West, between 1974 and 2010, when he retired and the seat was won by Gavin Williamson for the Conservative Party.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Council Offices on Wolverhampton Road in Codsall. The building was purpose-built for the council shortly after it was created, opening in 1976 to replace buildings in Penkridge and Wombourne that the council inherited from its predecessors.

==Settlements and parishes==

The whole district is divided into civil parishes. No parish in South Staffordshire has been declared to be a town by its parish council. None of South Staffordshire&#x27;s settlements are classed as post towns either; postal addresses in the district therefore all include the name of a post town outside the district, the main ones being Cannock, Stourbridge, Stafford, Walsall and Wolverhampton. The district&#x27;s parishes are:
*Acton Trussell and Bednall
*Bilbrook
*Blymhill and Weston-under-Lizard
*Bobbington
*Brewood and Coven
*Cheslyn Hay
*Codsall
*Coppenhall
*Dunston
*Enville
*Essington
*Featherstone
*Great Wyrley
*Hatherton
*Hilton
*Himley
*Huntington
*Kinver
*Lapley, Stretton and Wheaton Aston
*Lower Penn
*Pattingham and Patshull
*Penkridge
*Perton
*Saredon
*Shareshill
*Swindon
*Teddesley Hay
*Trysull and Seisdon
*Wombourne
At the 2021 census the Office for National Statistics identified three built-up areas in the district with a population over 10,000, being Great Wyrley and Cheslyn Hay with 17,640 people, Wombourne with 12,815 and Codsall (including Bilbrook) with 11,865.

==Countryside==
There are many beauty spots within the South Staffordshire district, for example the village of Wombourne has the Wom Brook Walk and the Bratch Locks on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal in the nearby village of Bratch.
Other sites include:

<doc id="449195" wikidata="Q2116362" url="?curid=449195" title="Staffordshire Moorlands">
<text>Staffordshire Moorlands is a local government district in Staffordshire, England. Its council is based in Leek, the district&#x27;s largest town. The district also contains the towns of Biddulph and Cheadle, along with a large rural area containing many villages. North-eastern parts of the district lie within the Peak District National Park.

The area&#x27;s principal industries are agriculture, fashion and tourism. Visitor attractions include the National Trust property Biddulph Grange, the Churnet Valley Railway, the UK&#x27;s largest theme park Alton Towers Resort, and the annual Leek Arts Festival. There are also a variety of outdoor pursuits such as rock climbing (The Roaches), sailing (Rudyard Lake) and cycling (Waterhouses).

The neighbouring districts are East Staffordshire, Stafford, Stoke-on-Trent, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Cheshire East, High Peak and Derbyshire Dales.

==History==
Historically the area was contained in the Hundred of Totmonslow, except for the parish of Biddulph, which was in Pirehill Hundred. The district makes up the majority of the area of the now obsolete Totmonslow Hundred, with the remaining area of the Hundred now falling in East Staffordshire District. The Hundred was named after a small hamlet of Totmonslow in the parish of Draycott in the Moors, which is within Staffordshire Moorlands District.

The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 covering four former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Biddulph Urban District
*Cheadle Rural District
*Leek Rural District
*Leek Urban District
The new district was named Staffordshire Moorlands, reflecting the landscape of this sparsely populated and largely upland part of the county.

In February 2008, the council formed a strategic alliance with the neighbouring High Peak Borough Council to share a number of services and staff as a way of reducing costs, including a shared chief executive and senior management team.

==Governance==

Staffordshire Moorlands District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Staffordshire County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

Large parts of the district are within the Peak District National Park. In those areas, town planning is the responsibility of the Peak District National Park Authority. The district council appoints one of its councillors to serve on the 30-person National Park Authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being led by a Labour minority administration.

The first elections were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1999 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a subsequent change of allegiance in May 2024, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2003 the council has comprised 56 councillors representing 27 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

Staffordshire Moorlands is the local UK Parliament constituency. Its boundaries do not match up with the District Council area. The MP since 2010 has been Karen Bradley, a Conservative. She served as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport from 14 July 2016 until 8 January 2018, when she was appointed Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

===Premises===
The council is based at Moorlands House on Stockwell Street in Leek. The front part of the building facing Stockwell Street was formerly called New Stockwell House and had been built in 1937 as the headquarters of the Leek and Moorlands Building Society (later the Leek and Westbourne Building Society). The building was acquired in early 1974 as part of the preparations for the local government reorganisation later that year. A large extension including a new main entrance was added to the rear of the building in 1986, after which the building was renamed Moorlands House.

==Geography==
The Staffordshire Moorlands district is in the southern end and foothills of the Pennines, with some of the northern parts lying in the Peak District National Park. The terrain is mostly uplands to the north of the district and lower-lying to the south, with rolling hills, crags and valleys across forests and lakes. The upland terrain is divided into high gritstone moorlands of the Dark Peak in the northwest and limestone landscape of the White Peak in the northeast. The district is named after the moors in the northwest along with smaller patches of lowland heaths across the district, such as Wetley Moor near Werrington. The highest point in both the district and Staffordshire is Cheeks Hill, rising up to 520m (1,710 feet) on Axe Edge Moor.

The area approximately between Axe Edge Moor and the Churnet Valley is in the Dark Peak and includes the Roaches, a series of gritstone outcrops which rises to 505m (1,657 feet) and where several red-necked wallabies roamed free for many years. On the other hand, the western half of Dovedale and the Manifold Valley, including Thor&#x27;s Cave, Wetton Mill, Longnor and Butterton, are in the White Peak. The Churnet Valley is a steep-sided, wooded valley in the south of the district, running between Cheddleton and Rocester, also known as &quot;The Rhineland of Staffordshire&quot; or Staffordshire&#x27;s &quot;Little Switzerland&quot;.

The Staffordshire Moorlands is also home to the highest village in Britain, Flash. The village stands at 463m (1,518 feet) above sea level. This record was confirmed in 2007 by the Ordnance Survey after Wanlockhead in Scotland also claimed the record. The BBC&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot; investigated the case in a bid to settle the argument and Flash turned out to be the higher of the two.

The council maintains a number of local nature reserves including Biddulph Valley Way, Brough Park Fields, Cecilly Brook, Hales Hall Pool, Hoften&#x27;s Cross Meadows, Ladderedge Country Park and Marshes Hill Common.

==Media==
In terms of television, the area is served by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central broadcasting from Birmingham. Television signals are received the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter. However, Biddulph is served by BBC North West and ITV Granada, broadcast from Salford. Television signals for the town are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter.

Radio stations for the area are BBC Radio Stoke, Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire, Greatest Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire and Moorlands Radio, a community-based radio station that broadcasts from its studios in Leek.

&quot;The Sentinel&quot; is the local newspaper that covers the area.

==Towns and parishes==


The whole district is covered by civil parishes. The parish councils for Biddulph, Cheadle and Leek have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. The small parish of Blore with Swinscoe has a parish meeting rather than a parish council. The parishes are:

<text>Bärbel Bohley (24 May 1945 – 11 September 2010) was an East German opposition figure and artist. 

==Biography==
As an artist, Bohley won prizes from the authorities, including a trip to the Soviet Union. Her opposition to the government did not start until the 1980s. In 1983 she was expelled from the GDR artists federation (VBK) and was banned from travelling abroad or exhibiting her work in East Germany. She was accused of having contacts to the West German Green Party.

In 1985 she was one of the co-founders of the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights. In 1988 she was arrested during a demonstration and expelled from the DDR. She was given a six-month visa to the United Kingdom, and she returned to East Germany that August. In 1989 she was one of the founders of New Forum.

After the unification of Germany in 1990 she was involved in several court trials because she publicly proclaimed Gregor Gysi to have been a Stasi informer. Bohley spent several days in prison because she would neither publicly retract the statement nor pay a fine.

One of her later projects was a group help project near Sarajevo, where she put great effort into building homes in order to enable refugees to return after the armed conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Bärbel Bohley died on 11 September 2010 of lung cancer.

<doc id="449200" wikidata="Q1931811" url="?curid=449200" title="Mid Suffolk">
<text>Mid Suffolk is a local government district in Suffolk, England. The district is primarily a rural area, containing just three towns, being Stowmarket, Needham Market and Eye. Its council was based in Needham Market until 2017 when it moved to shared offices with neighbouring Babergh District Council in Ipswich, outside either district. In 2021 it had a population of 103,417.

The neighbouring districts are East Suffolk, Ipswich, Babergh, West Suffolk, Breckland and South Norfolk.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering five former districts which were all abolished at the same time:
*Eye Municipal Borough
*Gipping Rural District
*Hartismere Rural District
*Stowmarket Urban District
*Thedwastre Rural District
Thedwastre Rural District had been in the administrative county of West Suffolk prior to the reforms; the other districts had all been in East Suffolk. The new district was named Mid Suffolk, reflecting its position within the wider county.

==Governance==
Mid Suffolk District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Suffolk County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In 2011, Mid Suffolk and Babergh District Councils began working together, with one, fully integrated staff structure.

===Political control===
The council has been under Green Party majority control since the 2023 election, being the first time that the party had taken majority control of any council.

The first elections were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2003 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a subsequent by-election in May 2024, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in May 2027, where all seats of the council will be up for election.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 34 councillors representing 26 wards, with each ward electing one or two councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
Since 2017 Babergh and Mid Suffolk councils have their combined headquarters at Endeavour House in Ipswich, sharing the building with Suffolk County Council.
When first created the council inherited offices in Elmswell, Eye, Stowmarket and Needham Market from its predecessors. It initially used the former Hartismere Rural District Council offices on Castleton Way in Eye as its headquarters, retaining the former Gipping Rural District Council offices in Needham Market and Stowmarket Urban District Council offices at Red Gables on Ipswich Road as secondary offices.

The council initially decided to consolidate its offices in Stowmarket, being the district&#x27;s largest town and a central location, but no suitable site could be found there. Instead it decided to extend the former Gipping Rural District Council&#x27;s headquarters in Needham Market. The original building there was a large eighteenth century house called &quot;Hurstlea&quot; at 131 High Street. A large modern extension was built behind the original building, which was formally opened in January 1982.

==Towns and parishes==

The whole district is covered by civil parishes. The parish councils for Eye, Needham Market and Stowmarket have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

<doc id="449203" wikidata="Q797643" url="?curid=449203" title="Babergh District">
<text>Babergh District (pronounced , ) is a local government district in Suffolk, England. In 2021 it had a population of 92,300. The district is primarily a rural area, containing just two towns, Sudbury and Hadleigh, which was the administrative centre until 2017 when the council moved to shared offices with neighbouring Mid Suffolk District Council in Ipswich, outside either district. The district is named after the medieval Babergh Hundred, which covered part of the area.

The district includes parts of two designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Dedham Vale, known for its association with painter John Constable, and Suffolk Coast and Heaths.

The neighbouring districts are East Suffolk, Ipswich, Mid Suffolk, West Suffolk, Braintree, Colchester and Tendring.

== History ==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering five former districts which were all abolished at the same time:
*Cosford Rural District
*Hadleigh Urban District
*Melford Rural District
*Samford Rural District
*Sudbury Municipal Borough
Samford Rural District had been in the administrative county of East Suffolk prior to the reforms; the other districts had all been in West Suffolk.

The new district was named Babergh after the medieval hundred of Babergh, which had covered part of the area. Babergh Hundred is referred to in the Domesday Book of 1086; the modern district covers a larger area than the historic hundred, also covering the hundreds of Cosford and Samford. The council&#x27;s logo now says &quot;Babergh District Council – South Suffolk&quot;.

==Governance==
Babergh District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Suffolk County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In 2011, Babergh and Mid Suffolk District Councils began working together, with one, fully integrated staff structure.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2019 election. Following the 2023 election a coalition of the Greens, independents and Liberal Democrats formed to run the council.

The first elections were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
Prior to 2014 there was no formal position of leader of the council at Babergh, with political leadership provided instead by the chair of the policy and resources committee, or its successor, the strategy committee. From 2014 onwards, the chair of the strategy committee was also given the title of leader. The council then moved from a committee system to a leader and cabinet model in 2017, giving the leader additional powers to make executive decisions. The leaders (or chairs of policy and resources / strategy committees) since 1998 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 32 councillors representing 24 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
Since 2017 Babergh and Mid Suffolk councils have their combined headquarters at Endeavour House in Ipswich, sharing the building with Suffolk County Council.
When the council was first created it inherited offices in Sudbury, Hadleigh and Ipswich from its predecessor councils. The council initially based itself at the former Cosford Rural District Council&#x27;s offices at 32 High Street in Hadleigh. The council built itself a new headquarters on Corks Lane in Hadleigh, incorporating existing cottages and granaries into the new building. The new complex was formally opened on 4 June 1982.

==Geography==

The southern boundary of the district is marked almost exclusively by the River Stour, which also forms the border with Essex, and it is separated from East Suffolk by the River Orwell. The eastern part of the district forms a peninsula between the two tidal rivers, coming to a point at Shotley Gate.
&#x27;Constable Country&#x27; is cognate with a large tract of Babergh: drawing visitors to the Dedham Vale, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and the well-preserved villages of Long Melford, Lavenham and Kersey. The district also includes part of the built-up area of Ipswich at Pinewood.

==Demography==
Babergh&#x27;s population size has increased by 5.2%, from around 87,700 in 2011 to 92,300 in 2021 and covers an area of approximately .

==Towns and parishes==

The whole district is covered by civil parishes. The parish councils for Sudbury and Hadleigh have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

<text>Forest Heath was a local government district in Suffolk, England. Its council was based in Mildenhall. Other towns in the district included Newmarket. The population of the district at the 2011 Census was 59,748.

The district&#x27;s name reflected the fact that it contains parts of both Thetford Forest and the heathlands of Breckland. The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by a merger of Newmarket Urban District and Mildenhall Rural District. Forest Heath district was merged with the borough of St Edmundsbury on 1 April 2019 to form a new West Suffolk district.

Forest Heath was the home to two of the largest United States Air Force (USAF) airbases in the UK: RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall, as well as the headquarters of British horse racing, Newmarket Racecourse.

Forest Heath had had a high suicide rate when compared to the rest of Suffolk, to the East of England and to England overall. The reasons for this are unknown.

In the English indices of deprivation 2010 report published by the Department for Communities and Local Government, two parts of Forest Heath have the highest employment out of 32483 areas in England.

==Governance==
As of the 2015 Local Government Elections, the Conservatives held overall control of the District Council.
==Communities==
The district contains three market towns and twenty civil parishes.

<doc id="449209" wikidata="Q1234166" url="?curid=449209" title="Borough of Spelthorne">
<text>Spelthorne is a local government district with borough status in Surrey, England. Its council is based in Staines-upon-Thames; other settlements in the area include Ashford, Sunbury-on-Thames, Shepperton, Stanwell and Laleham. It is named after the medieval Spelthorne Hundred which had covered the area.

The borough is largely urban; although outside the boundaries of Greater London, it is almost entirely inside the M25 motorway which encircles London. The borough contains several large reservoirs, including the Wraysbury Reservoir, Staines Reservoirs and Queen Mary Reservoir, which all supply fresh water to London and surrounding areas.

The neighbouring districts are Elmbridge, Runnymede, Windsor and Maidenhead, Slough, Hillingdon, Hounslow and Richmond upon Thames, the latter three being London boroughs.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering two former districts which were both abolished at the same time:
*Staines Urban District
*Sunbury-on-Thames Urban District
These two urban districts had been part of Middlesex prior to 1965, when they had been transferred to Surrey on the creation of Greater London. The new district was named after the medieval hundred of Spelthorne, which had covered the area plus adjoining parts of modern Greater London. The district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

The borough ceded a small amount of land in 1995, when Poyle was transferred to Slough. The Spelthorne area was included in the Metropolitan Police District from 1840 until 2000, when it passed to Surrey Police.

Spelthorne remains part of the Church of England Diocese of London and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Westminster. The rest of Surrey falls into the Anglican dioceses of Guildford and Southwark, and the Roman Catholic diocese of Arundel and Brighton.

Floods in 2014 caused internal damage to 891 (or 2.2%) of homes in Spelthorne due to record rainfall causing Thames flooding. This compared to internal damage to more than 30% of homes in the neighbouring settlement of Wraysbury in the borough of Windsor and Maidenhead.

In 2014 a campaign group of local business leaders called for the borough – along with others close to the capital – to be transferred from the county of Surrey to Greater London. The proposal was generally opposed by the public and was not pursued.

==Governance==
Spelthorne Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Surrey County Council. There are no civil parishes in the borough, which is an unparished area.

On 27 February 2024, Spelthorne Borough Council unveiled their Corporate Plan for 2024-2028, highlighting their key priorities for the next few years. 

As of 2023, the council had £1.1 billion in borrowing, with the highest borrowing to income ratio of any council in England.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2020. Following the 2023 election, independent councillor Joanne Sexton was appointed leader of the council, with Liberal Democrat councillor Chris Bateson serving as deputy leader.

The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Spelthorne. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1995 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and subsequent by-elections and changes of allegiance up to July 2024, the composition of the council was:
Five of the independent councillors sit together as the &#x27;Independent Spelthorne Group&#x27;, the other sits with the Conservatives. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===
Since the last boundary changes in 2003 the council has comprised 39 councillors representing 13 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council offices are at Knowle Green in Staines. The building was opened in 1972 for the former Staines Urban District Council, shortly before that council was abolished in 1974 to be replaced by Spelthorne Borough Council.

==Parks, lakes and the River Thames==
The borough council estimates it has of parks, including, from Shepperton upstream, the Thames Path. Its sixteen main parks with recreational/sports facilities are supplemented by small greens and linear parks, such as those by the River Thames. The largest parks have woodland and flowering meadow. These support diverse and rare grasses, invertebrates and birds on a rich alluvial soil: &quot;Laleham Park&quot; and &quot;Sunbury Park&quot;.

The final great reduction of private parks was that of the early 20th century, a sale of Laleham manor demesne by the Earl of Lucan. The Jockey Club, as owner of Kempton Park Racecourse, is successor to the domain of the lords of the manor of Kempton – about 40% is a large nature reserve with its internal two large ponds abutting the Kempton Park Reservoirs Site of Special Scientific Interest, on Thames flood meadow.

The borough has five reservoirs, covering more than 15% of land, which apart from their main use of ensuring a stable and energy-efficient drinking water supply to London, are bird reserves and in the case of the Queen Mary Reservoir, a sailing training centre. A similar percentage of land is covered by other lakes, mostly former gravel pits no longer pumped out of water. The River Ash, Surrey starts and ends in the borough.

Of recognised high importance to nature is Staines Moor, which alongside &quot;Sheepwalk Lake and wetlands&quot;, Shepperton are the sites of special scientific interest (SSSI).

==Tourism==
Hospitality is widespread in the riverside towns. Sunbury and Staines town hubs are within of top UK attractions such as Windsor Castle, Thorpe Park, Hampton Court, Twickenham Rugby Stadium and Kew Gardens.

==Transport==
Staines is the borough&#x27;s main station, being served by South Western Railway services to London Waterloo, Reading and Windsor &amp; Eton Riverside.

==Other land use==
A January 2005 enhanced base map study by the Office for National Statistics managed to classify , 99% of land in Spelthorne. The findings of this study showed that the land use in Spelthorne was as follows:


Two Rivers Retail Park and Elmsleigh Shopping Centre in Staines-upon-Thames.
In 2016 there were:
*5,365 businesses (including retailers) in Spelthorne.
*a 10 screen cinema with Dolby Digital Surround Sound.
*12 miles of river frontage for picturesque walks.
*65% green belt land or water – a green and blue buffer offsetting local major economic contributors Heathrow Airport and the UK motorway network

==Sport and leisure==

The district has two publicly sponsored leisure centres and two private clubs with pools, and two without pools:
*Sunbury and Staines Leisure Centres
*the &quot;Thames Club&quot; Staines
*&quot;Nuffield Health&quot; Sunbury
*&quot;Pure Gym&quot; Staines
*&quot;The Gym &quot;Sunbury

It has two golf courses.

School-taught English sports: cricket and football are played at many pitches; the third, rugby union is played at the London Irish Hazelwood Centre sharing pitches with London Irish Amateur Rugby Football Club in Sunbury. Staines Rugby Club play next to the Feltham-Hanworth-Sunbury tripoint in Lower Feltham.

Spelthorne has two football clubs – semi- or non-professional – as the top men&#x27;s sides compete in the lower leagues:
Spelthorne hosts one of the county&#x27;s major archery clubs (Spelthorne Archers) and five lawn bowls clubs.

Fishing is open to all, subject to rod licensing, from the Thames Path National Trail and adjoining islands in Laleham and Staines as well as at lakes in Shepperton and Ashford. One rowing club is in the borough, at Laleham, with others nearby including Staines Boat Club across Staines Bridge from the town centre which organises a regatta to Penton Hook in July for racing shells. Sunbury Skiff and Punting Club is the newest of all six which are quite clustered on the Thames, several of which incorporate dongola racing, dragon boat racing and canoeing. It organises an August regatta with fireworks.

In May the Staines 10k charity run takes place organised by two local running/&#x27;strolling&#x27; clubs and the council. One of the more than 720 nationwide 5,000-metre running competitions of the major organiser is around the rugby union club in its borders, which has a small nature reserve it owns to one end.

Other venues hosting annual events in a range of sports are Kempton Park Racecourse and Staines Lammas Park.

==Towns and villages==
The stated proportion of land that is absorbed by domestic dwellings tends to be housing with gardens forming suburbs to London and otherwise has mid rise urban town centres with exceptional offices (in Staines-upon-Thames) and apartments (in Sunbury-on-Thames) which are high rise, including a minority of the social housing.

The non-urban parts, inclusive of the embanked water retaining reservoirs, are today for the most part Spelthorne&#x27;s parks and lakes. The bulk of the rest is mostly narrow buffering land being arable farming, horse-grazing meadows and sheep grazing on the reservoir embankments and fringes with Green Belt legal status. Shopping is available in each of the towns and in the village of Shepperton but not in the other small villages which are connected by road and bus to the nearby towns. Kempton Park Racecourse and Shepperton Studios are in Spelthorne. Staines is the largest town and has local government and judicial buildings. Each of the towns has libraries and schools.

In July 2017, Shepperton was named as the UK&#x27;s most courteous town by the National Campaign for Courtesy.

<doc id="449213" wikidata="Q2116333" url="?curid=449213" title="Surrey Heath">
<text>Surrey Heath is a local government district with borough status in Surrey, England. Its council is based in Camberley. Much of the area is within the Metropolitan Green Belt.

The neighbouring districts are Runnymede, Woking, Guildford, Rushmoor, Hart, Bracknell Forest, and Windsor and Maidenhead.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered the area of two former districts, which were both abolished at the same time:
*Frimley and Camberley Urban District
*Bagshot Rural District
The new district was named &quot;Surrey Heath&quot; in recognition of the extensive areas of heathland it contains, including Chobham Common and Lightwater Country Park, which form part of the wider Thames Basin Heaths. The new district was granted borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
Surrey Heath Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Surrey County Council. The eastern part of the borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
Since the 2023 election the council has been under Liberal Democrat majority control. Prior to 2023 the council had been led by Conservatives from its creation in 1974.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Surrey Heath. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1994 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election (including a postponed election in one ward) and a subsequent change of allegiance in July 2024, the composition of the council was:

Three of the four independent councillors sit together as &quot;The Community Group&quot;. The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===
The council is based at Surrey Heath House on Knoll Road in Camberley. The building was purpose-built for the council for £4.25m and was completed in 1987. The building was formally opened by Valerian Wellesley, Duke of Wellington on 17 July 1987.

===Controversies===
In 2016 the council bought The Square, the main shopping centre in the centre of Camberley, for £109million. By early 2023 the centre was reportedly valued at only £30 million, and the rents being received did not cover the interest payments on the debts the council had incurred in buying it.

In 2020 the council&#x27;s chief executive, Karen Whelan, resigned after an independent investigation found that a 30% increase in her remuneration during 2018–19 compared to the year before had been unlawfully approved by the former leader of the council, Moira Gibson.

==Geography==
The area forms the heart of the heath that spans Esher, Oxshott, Weybridge, Wisley, all around Woking, Brookwood, Deepcut, Pirbright, Frimley, Lightwater, Camberley, Chobham Common, Virginia Water and Ottershaw. It is made up of naturally wet, very acid sandy and loamy soil, which is just 1.9% of English soil and 0.2% of Welsh soil, which gives rise to pines and coniferous landscapes, such as pioneered at Wentworth and Foxhills estate (now spa, hotel, restaurant and golf club) by pro-American independence statesman Charles James Fox. In geology it gives rise to the name, Bagshot Formation.

The western section of the district is largely urbanised, with heaths nonetheless providing substantial green buffer around Camberley, Lightwater, Deepcut, Frimley, Frimley Green and Mytchett. The east of the district is less urbanized, and contains Surrey Heath&#x27;s four civil parishes:
*Bisley
*Chobham (includes Castle Green and Mimbridge)
*West End
*Windlesham (contains also Bagshot, Lightwater and Valley End).
The former Frimley and Camberley Urban District covering the west of the borough is an unparished area, governed directly by Surrey Heath Borough Council.

Within the borough there are five Sites of Special Scientific Interest, four of which are part of the Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area of European Importance as a habitat for certain endangered bird species; these make up some of the six Wildlife Reserves managed by Surrey Wildlife Trust in Surrey Heath.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 35 Councillors representing 14 wards, with each ward electing two or three Councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Wider politics===
The whole borough lies within the Surrey Heath constituency. The constituency is slightly larger than the borough, including the Normandy and Pirbright ward of Guildford Borough Council.

In 2014, the British Election Study named Surrey Heath as the most right-wing constituency in the country.

<doc id="449215" wikidata="Q1292592" url="?curid=449215" title="Borough of Elmbridge">
<text>Elmbridge is a local government district with borough status in Surrey, England. Its council is based in Esher, and other notable towns and villages include Cobham, Walton-on-Thames, Weybridge and Molesey. The borough lies just outside the administrative boundary of Greater London, but is almost entirely within the M25 motorway which encircles London. Many of the borough&#x27;s urban areas form part of the wider Greater London Built-up Area.

The neighbouring districts are Mole Valley, Guildford, Woking, Runnymede, Spelthorne, Richmond upon Thames and Kingston upon Thames, the latter two being London boroughs.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering two former districts which were both abolished at the same time:
*Esher Urban District
*Walton and Weybridge Urban District
The new district was named after the medieval Elmbridge hundred which had covered a similar area. The hundred appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Amelebrige&quot;. The name thus derives from the River Amele or Emley, an old name for the River Mole, rather than elm trees. The district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

In the early 1990s the neighbouring London Borough of Kingston upon Thames sought to have eastern parts of Elmbridge, including Long Ditton, Thames Ditton, Hinchley Wood, Weston Green and the Moleseys transferred to it, making the case that these areas had particularly strong social and economic ties to Kingston and Greater London. The proposal was considered by the Local Government Boundary Commission in 1992, but was not pursued.

==Governance==
Elmbridge Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Surrey County Council. Claygate is a civil parish, which forms a third tier of local government for that part of the borough only; the rest of the borough is an unparished area.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2016. Since the 2023 election the council has been run by a coalition of the Liberal Democrats and most of the residents&#x27; associations (RA), with a Liberal Democrat leader of the council.

The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Elmbridge. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2010 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, the composition of the council was:
The Thames Ditton and Weston Green RA, Esher RA, Molesey RA, Walton Society, and Weybridge and St George&#x27;s Independents sit together as the &quot;Residents&#x27; Associations Group&quot;, which forms the council&#x27;s administration in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. The next election is due in 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2016 the council has comprised 48 councillors representing 16 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council (one councillor for each ward) being elected each time for a four-year term of office. Surrey County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no borough council elections.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Civic Centre, off the High Street in the centre in Esher, which was purpose-built for the council in 1991.
When the council was created in 1974 it inherited offices at the Town Hall on New Zealand Avenue in Walton-on-Thames from Walton and Weybridge Urban District Council, and at Sandown House at 1 High Street from Esher Urban District Council. It initially used Walton Town Hall, a 1960s building, as its headquarters, retaining Sandown House as additional offices. The new Civic Centre was built on land behind Sandown House, which has since been converted into flats, whilst Walton Town Hall has been demolished.

==Geography==

In common with the nearby Surrey boroughs of Spelthorne and Epsom and Ewell, much of Elmbridge is a continuation of the built-up area of suburban London, and the areas of Molesey, Long Ditton, Thames Ditton, Hinchley Wood, Esher, Cobham and Claygate lie within the social and commercial orbit of neighbouring Kingston upon Thames. Molesey, Cobham, the Dittons and Claygate were included in the Metropolitan Police District from 1840 until 2000.

===Elevations, landscape and wildlife===
The northern third of the borough is flatter and fertile with free draining slightly acid loamy soil, similar to the south, as described in the Surrey article. In the next third, the first of the remarkable acid soil heaths in west Surrey begin to appear in places here , characterised by undulating heaths: these sandy and stony reliefs start in the east in the Esher Commons, covering the central swathe of the area including Oxshott Heath and Woods and areas of Weybridge and areas surrounding Wisley, a natural soil for pines, other evergreen trees as well as heather and gorse, described as naturally wet, very acid sandy and loamy soil which is just 1.9% of English soil and 0.2% of Welsh soil. Claremont Landscape Garden and Fan Court (now independent school) is on part of this elevated soil as is St George&#x27;s Hill. Most undeveloped land in Elmbridge is Metropolitan Green Belt.

The central band of forest/heath includes part of the &quot;Wisley and Ockham Commons&quot; reserve within the national wildlife trust scheme: see Surrey Wildlife Trust, several pine heath based golf courses and in the north there are reservoirs, on the side of which there is sheep grazing.

===Watercourses===
The Mole, passing the Grade I Church in Stoke D&#x27;Abernon, Cobham Mill at Grade II and Painshill Park and the Wey, passing Silvermere Golf Course and the Brooklands circuit, hotel and retail park, cut through the borough from south to north reaching the River Thames which denotes the northern border, stretching from Weybridge to Thames Ditton apart from inclusion of inhabited islands such as Wheatley&#x27;s Ait. The Wey and Mole have sources beyond gentle valleys which cut through the high North Downs to the south.

==Settlements within the Borough==
*Long Ditton
*Thames Ditton
*Hinchley Wood
*Claygate
*Weston Green
*Molesey (East Molesey)
*Esher &quot;including West End and Lower Green&quot;
*Oxshott
*Hersham &quot;including Burwood Park&quot;
*Molesey (West Molesey)
*Walton on Thames &quot;including Fieldcommon and Ashley Park&quot;
*Cobham &quot; including Fairmile and the hamlets of Hatchford&quot; and Downside
*Stoke D&#x27;Abernon
*Weybridge &quot;including St George&#x27;s Hill&quot;

==Affluence and The &quot;Grandees&quot;==
The borough is home to some of the county&#x27;s highest earners. It has been labelled Britain&#x27;s Beverly Hills by sections of the press. Famous residents, past and present, include Maurice Gibb Sir Cliff Richard, Mick Jagger, George Harrison, John Lennon, Ringo Starr, Ronnie Wood, Andy Murray, Kate Winslet, John Terry, Gary Lineker, Mick Hucknall, Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba, Theo Paphitis, Chris Tarrant, Peter Crouch, Michael Aspel and Shilpa Shetty.

St George&#x27;s Hill is noted as the site of one of the earliest experiments in common ownership of land by ordinary people, in a marked contrast to the area&#x27;s modern status as a wealthy private estate. In 1649 the &quot;Diggers&quot;, one of the radical groups set up in the aftermath of the English Civil War and the execution of Charles I seized common land in the area and lived by simple farming. As well as debates about religion and how the country should be run at this time these groups complained that even the Parliamentary side in the Civil War was dominated by &quot;Grandees&quot; i.e. wealthy nobles who often spent their time in comfort conducting fatuous debates in Parliament while the less well off risked their lives in the war to defeat an absolutist system. They were the subject of a long campaign of harassment by a local landowner and were eventually removed following a court case.

==Transport==
The M25 motorway has several junctions nearby and the A3(M) from London bisects the borough.

The main north-south road is the A244 for instance to London Heathrow Airport and starts in the borough at Walton Bridge leading to Esher and Oxshott then to Leatherhead. The east-west Leatherhead to Horsell, Woking road, the A245 leads by Cobham and Brooklands, Weybridge.

As to rail, the South West Main Line cuts through the borough, with four stations from Esher to Weybridge, one of which several express services call at: Walton on Thames in the Ashley Park estate of the south of the town. The branch lines have services with four stations in the borough via Cobham &amp; Stoke D&#x27;Abernon to Guildford; and a branch to Thames Ditton and Hampton Court railway station in East Molesey, both within Transport for London&#x27;s Zone 6.

Bus services include TfL Oyster card services to East and West Molesey, Hinchley Wood, Claygate and Esher.

Cycling is very popular, with the Thames Path passing through the north of the borough and the 2012 Summer Olympics hosting both of the main road cycling events in the borough with most of the road section around Hampton Court and with the sections of the routes taken to and from Box Hill.

==Economy==
The economy is diverse, with a strong local service sector, including numerous bars and restaurants, homes built and being built for city workers as the majority of locations have access to one of the Home Counties fastest commutes, trades including interior supplies, fitting, gardening, golf course/landscape management and a developed public/education sector. Of international renown are the employers Sony, Procter &amp; Gamble, JTI (formerly Gallaher) and Toshiba Information Systems alongside the local corporate venues and day-out attractions of Sandown Park Racecourse and Mercedes-Benz World. As of 2012, Elmbridge residents had average weekly earnings of £1162.

==Twinning==
The Borough of Elmbridge is not twinned with any towns. However, between 1966 and 2009 Elmbridge was formally twinned with the Paris suburb of Rueil-Malmaison, Hauts de Seine, France.

==Coat of arms==
The council&#x27;s arms were created upon the formation of the present day district, being formed out of symbols taken from the local towns and villages with the Latin motto meaning &quot;until the rivers cease&quot;. The arms include a depiction of an elm tree on a bridge, being a play on the district&#x27;s name.

<text>Mole Valley is a local government district in Surrey, England. Its council is based in Dorking, and the district&#x27;s other town is Leatherhead. The largest villages are Ashtead, Fetcham and Great Bookham, in the northern third of the district.

Most of the district is on the escarpments of or adjoins the Surrey Hills, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which cover parts of the North Downs and Greensand Ridge, including locally Leith Hill, Polesden Lacey and Box Hill. Denbies Wine Estate, the largest vineyard in the country, is on the hills north-west of Dorking. The Pilgrims&#x27; Way footpath runs along the North Downs. There are stations on the London–Worthing and Reading–Gatwick Airport railways, and in the northern third, a commuter stopping-service pattern line, London–Guildford (via Epsom) line.

The A24 road and the M25 motorway are the main thoroughfares and relative to London the incidence of car ownership is high. The area hosts hill-focussed sub-laps of the London–Surrey Classic cycling tour each year.

The neighbouring districts are Epsom and Ewell, Reigate and Banstead, Crawley, Horsham, Waverley, Guildford, Elmbridge and Kingston upon Thames, the latter being a London borough.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering three former districts which were all abolished at the same time:
*Dorking and Horley Rural District (except Horley and Salfords and Sidlow which went to Reigate and Banstead and parts of the parishes of Charlwood and Horley around Gatwick Airport which went to Crawley)
*Dorking Urban District
*Leatherhead Urban District
The new district was named after the River Mole, which flows through the area.

==Governance==
Mole Valley District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Surrey County Council. Parts of the district are covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government for their areas.

===Political control===
The council has been under Liberal Democrat majority control since 2019.

The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2012 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 39 councillors representing 13 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council (one councillor for each ward) elected each time for a four-year term of office. Surrey County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no district council elections.

Most of the district lies within the Mole Valley constituency, the exception being Ashtead which is within the Epsom and Ewell constituency.

===Premises===

The council is based at Pippbrook on Reigate Road in Dorking, which was purpose-built for the council and opened in 1984. It was built in the grounds of a large Victorian house, called Pippbrook House, which had served as the headquarters of the old Dorking Urban District Council from 1931 and then as Mole Valley District Council&#x27;s headquarters until the new building opened.

==Towns and parishes==

The former Leatherhead Urban District, which included Ashtead, Fetcham, Great Bookham and Little Bookham, is an unparished area, as is the majority of the former Dorking Urban District.

The rest of the district is covered by civil parishes:

*Abinger
*Betchworth
*Brockham
*Buckland
*Capel
*Charlwood
*Headley
*Holmwood
*Leigh
*Mickleham
*Newdigate
*Ockley
*Wotton
==Demographics==
A Legatum Prosperity Index published by the Legatum Institute in October 2016 showed Mole Valley as the second most prosperous council area in the United Kingdom, after the nearby Borough of Waverley.

==Churches graded II* or above==


==Emergency services==
Mole Valley is served by these emergency services:
* Surrey Police. Dorking Police Station is the lead station in Mole Valley Division, Leatherhead Police Station is now closed.
* South East Coast Ambulance Service The district has two Ambulance Stations – one in North Holmwood ( south of Dorking), and the other in Leatherhead.

<text>Epsom and Ewell () is a local government district with borough status in Surrey, England, covering the towns of Epsom and Ewell. The borough lies just outside the administrative boundary of Greater London, but it is entirely within the M25 motorway which encircles London. Many of the borough&#x27;s urban areas form part of the wider Greater London Built-up Area.

The neighbouring districts are Reigate and Banstead, Mole Valley, Kingston upon Thames and Sutton, the latter two being London boroughs.

==History==
Epsom and Ewell lies on the spring line on the north face of the North Downs where pervious chalk meets impervious London clay and a series of springs form. In Ewell the springs which form the Hogsmill River are evident, those in Epsom are less so. The springs attracted prehistoric people and remains have been found, mostly in Ewell and particularly near the Hogsmill. In Roman times the road now known as Stane Street, from London to Chichester, passed through Epsom and Ewell. Roman remains have been found in Ewell suggesting a sizeable settlement. Epsom and Ewell have Saxon names: Ewell takes its name from the spring in the centre of the town and Epsom, or Ebbisham, is the enclosure of Ebbi. A Saxon cemetery in The Grove in Ewell was excavated in the 1930s.

In medieval times the area was covered by three manors: Cuddington, which was owned by the Codington family; Epsom, which belonged to Chertsey Abbey; and Ewell, associated with Merton Priory. In 1538 the village of Cuddington was destroyed to make way for Henry VIII&#x27;s Nonsuch Palace and its parks. Henry died before the palace was complete but it was visited by his daughter Queen Elizabeth. It was demolished in 1682.

Epsom became a spa in the early 17th century when a spring containing Epsom salts was discovered on the Common. Its popularity with London society brought visits from Samuel Pepys and Nell Gwynne, the development of shops and inns and the oldest spa assembly rooms in England. This stands at the western end of Epsom High Street. Horse racing on Epsom Downs began during the spa period, but it was not until the Oaks was run in 1789 and the Derby the following year that it took on its present form. The first grandstand was built in 1830 and Queen&#x27;s Stand in 1995. The 1927 grandstand was demolished in 2007/8 and the new Duchess&#x27;s Stand opened in its place in 2009.

Many large houses were built in Epsom during and after the spa period. St Martin&#x27;s Church was rebuilt in 1825 and partly rebuilt in 1908 and the clock tower in the centre of the town replaced the earlier watchhouse in 1847. Ewell saw less change and, although now surrounded by suburbia. Its medieval church was replaced by the present Victorian one in 1848, but the medieval tower stands in the churchyard.

The Pre-Raphaelite painters, John Everett Millais and William Holman Hunt, had connections with both Ewell and Cuddington and used local scenes as backgrounds for a number of paintings, notably &#x27;Ophelia&#x27; by Millais and &#x27;The Light of the World&#x27; by Hunt.

In 1937, shortly after the creation of the current district, Epsom and Ewell was granted a coat of arms, which displays the district&#x27;s link with horse racing and spas. It is: &quot;Per chevron vert and argent, in chief two horses heads erased or and in base as many bars wavy azure.&quot; The motto is &quot;None Such&quot;, a pun on Nonsuch Palace. The same arms, with a different motto, are used by the local Epsom and Ewell High School.

In 1994 and 1995, minor alterations were made to the boundary of Epsom and Ewell with Greater London. This was first to better align the boundary with the Hogsmill River in West Ewell, as well as the roads in Stoneleigh. Prior to 1995, the border had followed the edge of old field boundaries not present since the development of Stoneleigh in the 1930s, causing the border to dissect roads, houses and gardens. The 1994-95 boundary alterations made very little net change in Epsom and Ewell&#x27;s population.

In 1995 Epsom and Ewell twinned with Chantilly in northern France, another racing town. Links are coordinated by Epsom and Ewell Town Twinning Association.

===Administrative history===
The parish of Epsom was made a local board district in 1850. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts in 1894. The urban district was enlarged in 1933 to take in the parishes of Ewell and Cuddington, and the following year the district&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Epsom and Ewell&quot;. It was made a municipal borough in 1937.

The district was considered for inclusion in Greater London in 1965 but was left unaltered by the London Government Act 1963. The district was redesignated as a non-metropolitan district in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, but kept the same boundaries and its borough status, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor, continuing Epsom and Ewell&#x27;s series of mayors dating back to 1937.

The area was in the Metropolitan Police District from 1840 until it was transferred to Surrey Police in 2000.

==Governance==
Epsom and Ewell Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Surrey County Council. There are no civil parishes in the borough, which is an unparished area.

===Political control===
Epsom and Ewell is one of the few councils dominated by a group not linked to a national political party. Epsom and Ewell Residents Association has been the main group on the council since the 1930s. Party affiliations were not recorded on ballot papers prior to 1970, but the Residents Association has certainly held a majority of the seats on the council since the reforms of 1974:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial at Epsom and Ewell Borough Council. The council does not appoint a leader of the council, with political leadership functions being split between the chair of the Residents Association and the chair of the strategy and resources committee. Since 2011 the chairs of the Residents Association have been:
The chairs of the strategy and resources committee since 2015 have been:
===Composition===
Following the 2023 election the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 35 councillors representing 14 wards, with each ward electing two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

Epsom and Ewell Parliamentary Constituency is one of the most Conservative seats and contains the entirety of the borough. As the population is not large enough for a full seat, it has also contained neighbouring areas. Since 1997 it also contains Ashtead, part of the Mole Valley district. Before boundaries changed in 1997 the constituency instead contained Banstead to the east, which is part of Reigate and Banstead borough.

===Premises===
The council is based at Epsom Town Hall on The Parade, which was completed in 1934 for the old Epsom Urban District Council.

==Geography==

The borough is at a range of elevations, scaling the lower slopes of the North Downs and drains into a large stream which springs above the surface in Ewell, the Hogsmill River which drains into the Thames at Kingston. The borough comprises:
*Epsom. Town and home of the Epsom Downs Racecourse.
*Ewell. Town and contains the suburbs of East Ewell, Ewell Court, Ewell Downs and West Ewell.
*Horton. Village west of Epsom.
*Langley Vale. Village to the south of Epsom Downs.
*Stoneleigh (except the far north of the suburb). Contains a large part of Nonsuch Park. 
*Worcester Park (part) (Cuddington ward).

A small portion of Cheam, including the eastern part of Nonsuch Park, as well as Nonsuch High School for Girls is in the eastern edge of the Borough.

===Demography and economics===
Much of the working population has middle (average) to upper-middle class levels of income. As to housing estates, housing prices are highest in the less densely developed Downs areas including the immediate border area to Cheam and Banstead; only the north-east of Epsom has housing close to the national average price. Its working class and its social housing recipients are concentrated most in the Ruxley and Court Wards of the Borough, among the most deprived in Surrey, but less so than the 50 most deprived wards of London. The average house price from sales in May 2021 was £561,577.

==Transport==
Railway stations in the borough include Epsom, Ewell East, Ewell West and Stoneleigh. Epsom Downs and Tattenham Corner stations sit on the borough borders. All stations in the Borough have accepted the Oyster card as payment and all except Epsom are in either fare zone 5 or 6. The borough is just north of, and entirely within, the M25 motorway. Gatwick Airport is 20 miles south from Epsom.

Numerous bus services run through Ewell into Epsom town centre such as London Buses services 166, 293, 406, 418, S2 and Surrey County Council subsidised services 460, 480, 318, Epsom local area routes E5, E9, E10 and E16. Most services were previously run by Quality Line however since the takeover of Epsom Coaches by the RATP Group, the Surrey County Council and commercial services have been contracted to different operators such as Falcon Coaches and Metrobus and the now defunct Buses Excetera (also known as Coaches Excetera) or have been discontinued entirely.

==Education==
The Borough of Epsom and Ewell has several secondary schools; Glyn School, Epsom and Ewell High School, Rosebery School for Girls and Blenheim High School. In addition it also has two private, fee paying schools; Epsom College and Ewell Castle School.
The borough also contains a special school for children and young people with autism and social communication difficulties; Linden Bridge School, in Worcester Park.

*North East Surrey College of Technology

===Higher education===
*University for the Creative Arts

<doc id="449223" wikidata="Q6863428" url="?curid=449223" title="MindVox">
<text>MindVox was an early Internet service provider in New York City. The service was referred to as &quot;the Hells Angels of Cyberspace&quot;. 

The service was founded in 1991 by Bruce Fancher (Dead Lord) and Patrick Kroupa (Lord Digital), two former members of the Legion of Doom hacker group. It was initially launched in March 1992 as an invite-only offering, and eventually made generally available to the public in November that same year.

MindVox was the second Internet Service Provider in New York City, and the first test message posted to Usenet via the service was created by the infamous hacker Phiber Optik, in 1992, while waiting for a Manhattan grand jury indictment for hacking activities. At this time, customers of the only other service provider had already posted nearly 6,000 messages. 

MindVox’s domain &quot;phantom.com&quot; was registered on 14 February 1992.

==Founding and early years==
The distinctive logo shown to the left was the system&#x27;s original ASCII art banner, appearing on the text-only service&#x27;s dial-up login page. MindVox was originally accessible only through telnet, FTP and direct dial-up. Its existence predates the invention of SSH and widespread use of the World Wide Web by several years. In later years, MindVox was also accessible via the web.

The parent company, Phantom Access Technologies, Inc., took its name from a hacking program written by Kroupa during his early teens, called Phantom Access.

MindVox functioned both as a private BBS service, containing its own dedicated discussion groups, termed &quot;conferences&quot; — though usually referred to as &quot;forums&quot; by users — as well as a provider of internet and Usenet access. By 1994 the subscriber base was at around 3,000. In many ways MindVox was a harder, edgier, New York incarnation of the WELL, a famous Northern Californian online community. While users were drawn from all over the world, the majority lived in the New York City area, and members who met through the conferences often became acquainted in person, either on their own, or through meetups that were termed &quot;VoxMeats&quot; (a formal gathering of members, whose &quot;double entendre&quot; name was rumored to be well-earned).

Prominent MindVox &quot;evangelists&quot; included sci-fi author Charles Platt, who wrote about MindVox for Wired Magazine and featured it within his book &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;. MindVox also attracted (sometimes with the aid of free accounts) artists, writers and activists, including Billy Idol, Wil Wheaton, Robert Altman, Douglas Rushkoff, John Perry Barlow, and Kurt Cobain. The level of hysteria and hype surrounding MindVox was so great that in 1993 executives at MTV who were using the system wanted to buy it outright and turn MindVox into a subsidiary of Viacom.

==&quot;Voices in My Head&quot;==
MindVox was deeply connected to the emerging non-academic hacker culture and ideas about the potentials of cyberspace, as can be seen in Patrick Kroupa&#x27;s essay, &quot;Voices in my Head, MindVox: The Overture&quot;, which announced the upcoming opening of MindVox, and crossed the line into shaping an entire culture&#x27;s mythology, seeing publication in magazines such as Wired, and extensive coverage throughout the media. &quot;Voices&quot; provided a compelling and sweeping first-person overview of the cultural forces that were at play in the hacker underground during the decade that pre-dated MindVox, considered by some the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of cyberspace.

More than a decade later, &quot;Voices&quot; remains one of the most read and widely distributed pieces of writing to ever emerge about the origins and possible futures of cyberspace. It was the spark that propelled Kroupa out of obscurity and into the pages of books, describing him as the Jim Morrison of cyberspace. &quot;Voices&quot; also helped turn MindVox from being just another ISP into a counter-cultural media darling meriting full-length features in magazines and newspapers such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

==&quot;Voice: Waffle ][+ the NeXTSTEP&quot;==
As with many things MindVox-related, the name of the software MindVox ran on, was both a play on words and an elaborate inside-joke. &quot;Voice: Waffle ][+ the NeXTSTEP&quot; (usually referred to simply as &quot;Voice,&quot; although it frequently was referred to by the plural &quot;Voices&quot; as well), was the name given to MindVox&#x27;s conferencing system. Waffle refers to the original software that MindVox was based on, the ][+ pays homage to Kroupa and Fancher&#x27;s hacker past and the use of Apple II computers; NeXTSTEP was a reference to the NeXT platform and operating system, with which MindVox was developed and launched.

As much as Patrick Kroupa&#x27;s &quot;Voices&quot; focused the media and counter-culture spotlight on MindVox; Fancher&#x27;s software was a source of tremendous attention in many MindVox-related stories and it&#x27;s unlikely that MindVox would have enjoyed its success without &quot;Voice&quot;. At the time MindVox launched, it was one of the first public-access ISPs in the world. The major technical difference between MindVox and every other system at the time, was instead of expecting newcomers to understand Unix and meet a cryptic shell prompt, the entire system was accessible through Fancher&#x27;s highly flexible interface.

The original Waffle software was written by Tom Dell, who was apparently part of MindVox from its inception. To this date there are Easter-eggs and cross-references on both MindVox and the system that Tom Dell became better known for in the late 1990s and beyond: Rotten.com. Going to Rotten&#x27;s search page, and triple-clicking on the whitespace located between the Contact section and the gray bar at the bottom, reveals an inscrutable ibogaine rant.

By the mid-1990s the original Waffle software was nearly unrecognizable; Fancher had converted &quot;Voice&quot; to a client-server architecture, included a web interface, and added elaborate &quot;power user&quot; features which seem to have been added to address the evolving needs of the community; or due to a strange combination of drugs, nostalgia and pure whim. An example of the latter case is VoxChat, a proprietary chat system written for MindVox by employee David Schenfeld, which spun off into the commercial product ENTchat after MindVox shut down. Diversi-Dial, and the Diversi-Dial spinoff ENTchat, allowed MindVox to connect via the Diversi-Dial chat protocol.), or in Kroupa&#x27;s own words:

:As of this writing there are roughly a dozen remaining DDIAL&#x27;s running on Apple computers, Novation has long since gone Chapter 11, Bill Basham (the author of DDIAL) has gone back to being a full-time doctor, and one slightly disturbed person in the Phantom Access Group has written the world&#x27;s only version of DDIAL that will run on Unix based machines and allow T1 connected, distributed sites with gigabytes of disk and thousands of users, to hook into Pig&#x27;s Knuckle Idaho&#x27;s very own 7 line DDIAL running at a blazing fast 300 baud. Why this was done is a question best left to mental health professionals.

The last sentence in the paragraph quoted above could be applied to many features present in the MindVox shell. It included advanced conferencing features interspersed with time-consuming, elaborate in-jokes with no commercial purpose whatsoever.
:The Fling Screen from MindVox. When inappropriate or extremely off-topic material was posted to a conference; moderators were unable to remove or destroy the message entirely, but they could move the message to the r0mPEr-RuM, a conference that was the collective garbage-dump of MindVox.

To this day the phantom.com MindVox archive continues its relationship with NeXT/NeXTSTEP, now in the form of Apple Computer&#x27;s macOS. Instead of using PHP, Perl or Active Server Pages, the entire site runs Apple&#x27;s WebObjects.

MindVox was a fusion of many strange parts, pieces and times. While Kroupa might be said to have provided the imaginative backstory of the &quot;thoughtscape&quot;, Fancher was largely responsible for the software that made it all work. The synergy of Kroupa, Fancher and the user-base MindVox attracted was a major aspect of MindVox&#x27;s rise to fame.

==The MindVox shutdown==
MindVox began to fall apart around 1996, when it ceased operating as an ISP, and shut off dial-up access. While the exact date of the shutdown is disputed, the &quot;New York Times&quot; lists the closure as occurring in July of that year. Ironically, this happened a few months after &quot;New York Magazine&quot; voted MindVox as one of the three best ISPs in New York.

A public message noted that free telnet access to the MindVox servers would still be available after the shutdown, but this did not last. While users were given the option to transfer their accounts to Interport Communications, the unique MindVox community did not survive.

Many different reasons have been given for the downfall, including increased competition from the arrival of large-scale providers like AT&amp;T, possible legal difficulties, and the apparent incestuousness of the company and its core users. But none of the theories provided realistic answers as to why the final days of MindVox seem to be closer to &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, and &quot;Altered States&quot;, than a successful or unsuccessful technology corporation. Much of the legal paperwork from the time reads like something out of &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;.

A 1999 article by Tom Higgins (username &quot;Tomwhore&quot; on the system), a user and one time employee of MindVox, summarized the turbulent closing thus:

:So what happened to MindVox? In short its customers happened. Under the strain of pleasing a paying customer base, watching a hobby turn into an industry and simply getting caught up in its own hype, MindVox tumbled into a soap opera nose dive of sex, drugs and mismanagement.

By 1997 Patrick Kroupa had effectively disappeared from public view. The last days of MindVox are more the stuff of mythology than recorded fact, with different publications listing different dates for the shutdown. The New York Times and Wired were apparently unable to arrive at a consensus, with the Times listing the sale of MindVox&#x27;s client-base and the closing of the system, in 1996, while Wired was still covering an apparently open and at least partially operational MindVox circa 1997.

Additional material suggests MindVox was never fully &quot;closed&quot; but simply closed to the public to become a private, invitation-only system. Rumors of a private, &quot;inside&quot; MindVox circulated, fueled by reprints of supposed internal MindVox messages from 1998 and 1999 that circulated on various mailing lists. The &quot;mindvox.com&quot; domain remained registered while, for a time, mail to &quot;phantom.com&quot; was redirected to Interport. The major discrepancy between the Times and Wired dates lends additional credence to the idea that MindVox continued, at least for a while, to support a community after its modem lines were turned off.

==MindVox in the 21st century==
During 2000 a variety of MindVox pieces went back online, at &quot;phantom.com&quot; and additional material was released by MindVox to &quot;textfiles.com&quot;. By 2001, Kroupa was back in the public eye and openly acknowledged being a lifelong heroin addict, who had finally kicked heroin and cocaine through the use of the hallucinogenic drug ibogaine.

It is unclear whether mailing lists on MindVox continued in perpetuity from the 1990s, or began reappearing in 2000, but in addition to the Vox list it was hosting, by 2001 MindVox was a hub of activity in the fields of harm reduction, drug policy reform, and psychedelic drugs (most notably Ibogaine).

While the drug-related community surrounding MindVox : Ibogaine has taken on a completely new life, the interactive system itself as well as the internal conferences and other services MindVox provided, have not returned (despite announcements and plans heralding the perpetually delayed rebirth of MindVox).

In 2005, MindVox was featured in two documentary films. Bruce Fancher is interviewed in &quot;&quot;, and Patrick Kroupa plays himself in &quot;&quot;.

On December 9, 2005, the Transcriptions Project, placed The Agrippa Files online, which included Matthew G. Kirschenbaum&#x27;s, &quot;Hacking &#x27;Agrippa&#x27;: The Source of the Online Text,&quot; an excerpt from his book &quot;Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination&quot;. The &quot;Agrippa&quot; discussed by Kirschenbaum was an unusual cyberpunk-influenced media project from 1992 by the science-fiction author William Gibson; its first public &quot;leak&quot; was to MindVox users in December of that year.

Within the chapter, Kirschenbaum references several personal letters to Patrick Kroupa, circa 2003, and reveals that Kroupa cooperated with him by placing all of MindVox back online &quot;for an hour or 5&quot; so that Kirschenbaum could view the context within which Agrippa was originally released. In discussing the service, Kirschenbaum referred to MindVox as &quot;a kind of interface between what Alan Sondheim has aptly called the &quot;darknet&quot; and the clean, well lighted cyberspaces&quot;.

==MindVox reloaded==

MindVox re-opened in the form of a closed alpha, on December 21st, 2012.

While the labyrinth of conferences, files and user interactions providing a unique overview of the birth of the public internet that are buried within the depths of MindVox have never re-surfaced or been made publicly available, limited archives of some parts of the service remain online at:
* https://web.archive.org/web/20050827230356/http://www.phantom.com/
* http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/

An IRC channel, EFnet #mindvox, created in the 1990s, has survived as a gathering place for some members of the older community.

<doc id="449224" wikidata="Q2301760" url="?curid=449224" title="Tandridge District">
<text>Tandridge is a local government district in east Surrey, England. Its council is based in Oxted, although the largest settlement is Caterham; other notable settlements include Warlingham, Godstone and Lingfield. In mid-2019, the district had an estimated population of 88,129.

Tandridge borders the Borough of Reigate and Banstead to the west, the London Borough of Croydon to the north, the London Borough of Bromley to the north-east, the Sevenoaks District of Kent to the east, the Wealden District of East Sussex to the south-east, the Mid Sussex District of West Sussex to the south and the Borough of Crawley, also in West Sussex, to the south-west.

The district contains parts of the North Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the Weald. It also contains several woodlands and some open heathland. Elevations above sea level range from at Botley Hill, in the North Downs near Oxted, to near Edenbridge.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered the whole area of two former districts, which were both abolished at the same time:
*Caterham and Warlingham Urban District
*Godstone Rural District
The new district was named after the medieval Tandridge Hundred, which had covered a similar area. From the seventeenth century onwards, hundreds gradually declined in importance as administrative divisions, with their functions passing to other bodies such as the county courts. The final administrative functions of hundreds had been extinguished in 1886. The Tandridge hundred was named after the hillside village and ridge of the North Downs, Tandridge.

The vast majority of the district is covered by the Metropolitan Green Belt to prevent extension of the London urban area.

The district is not currently twinned, but one of its towns, Lingfield, is twinned with Plaisance-du-Touch, a commune on the outskirts of Toulouse, France.

==Governance==
Tandridge District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Surrey County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2019. It has been led since 2021 by a minority administration comprising local party the Oxted and Limpsfield Residents Group (OLRG) and some of the independent councillors.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2000 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, the composition of the council is:

The twelve Residents Association councillors sit with the Oxted and Limpsfield Residents Group as the &quot;Residents&#x27; Alliance&quot; which forms the council&#x27;s administration. The next election is due 7 May 2026.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Council Offices on Station Road East in Oxted (the building is actually in the parish of Limpsfield). The building was purpose-built for the council in 1989 on the site of the old Godstone Rural District Council&#x27;s headquarters.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2024, the council has comprised 43 councillors representing 18 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with roughly a third of the council elected each time to serve a four-year term. Surrey County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no district council elections.

==Parishes==
The entire district is divided into civil parishes. The former Caterham and Warlingham Urban District was an unparished area until 2000, when six parishes were created covering that area: Caterham-on-the-Hill, Caterham Valley, Chaldon, Warlingham, Whyteleafe and Woldingham. None of Tandridge&#x27;s parish councils are styled as a &quot;town council&quot;. The Royal Mail classes Caterham, Godstone, Lingfield, Oxted, Warlingham, and Whytleafe as post towns.


Each civil parish is named after one of its towns or villages which has been established around an Anglican church. All other settlements/neighbourhoods with their own Anglican church or chapel and therefore traditionally in England defined as &quot;a village&quot; are marked with an asterisk.
A double asterisk indicates the locality has a church hall used as a Church of England church. One chapel in Limpsfield ecclesiastical parish and civil parish has no adjoining settlement, in Staffhurst Wood.

<doc id="449233" wikidata="Q1971075" url="?curid=449233" title="West Wiltshire">
<text>West Wiltshire was a local government district in Wiltshire, England, between 1974 and 2009, when it was superseded by the new Wiltshire unitary area.

The district was formed on 1 April 1974, further to the Local Government Act 1972, as a merger of the former urban districts of Bradford-on-Avon, Melksham, Trowbridge, Warminster and Westbury, along with Bradford and Melksham Rural District and the Warminster and Westbury Rural District. There were five towns in the district – Bradford-on-Avon, Melksham, Trowbridge, Warminster and Westbury – each surrounded by rural parishes. About two-thirds of the district&#x27;s population was in those towns.

The district council was based at purpose-built offices in Bradley Road, Trowbridge. It was abolished on 1 April 2009 as part of the structural changes to local government in England, when its functions were taken over by the new Wiltshire unitary authority.

==District Council==

West Wiltshire District Council had forty-four members, all elected together for a four-year term of office. The first elections were held in 1973 and the last in 2007.

===Political control=== 
Initially, in 1973, the district council had no overall control. The Conservatives took control during the 1980s, and then the Liberal Democrats from 1991 to 2003. At the elections of May 2003, 19 Conservatives, 19 Liberal Democrats, two Labour members and four Independents were elected. In this hung council, an administration of Conservatives and Independents led by Councillor A. G. Phillips (Independent) held office from May 2003 to May 2005, followed by a coalition of Liberal Democrats and Independents led by Councillor Sarah Content (Liberal Democrat), from May 2005 to May 2007. At the elections of May 2007, 26 Conservatives, 14 Liberal Democrats, and four Independents were elected as members of the Council, giving the Conservatives overall control for the first time since 1990. The Conservatives appointed Graham Payne (Conservative) as Leader and A. G. Phillips (by now also a Conservative) as Deputy Leader.

==Parliamentary representation==

At the parliamentary level, most of the district of West Wiltshire was in the Westbury constituency, with the remaining two parishes coming under Devizes. Throughout the district&#x27;s existence, both seats were held by Conservative Members of Parliament, latterly Andrew Murrison (Westbury) and Michael Ancram (Devizes).

<text>North Wiltshire was a local government district in Wiltshire, England, between 1974 and 2009, when it was superseded by the unitary area of Wiltshire.

The district was formed on 1 April 1974 by a merger of the municipal boroughs of Calne, Chippenham, and Malmesbury along with Calne and Chippenham Rural District, Cricklade and Wootton Bassett Rural District and Malmesbury Rural District. It shared its name with the North Wiltshire parliamentary constituency, the boundaries of which were coterminous with that of the district until 1997.

The new body&#x27;s headquarters were in central Chippenham at Bewley House, a large office block which had been built in 1967 for Calne and Chippenham Rural District Council. They later moved to newly built offices at Monkton Park, another site in the town centre, overlooking the River Avon.

The district was abolished on 1 April 2009 as part of the structural changes to local government in England, when its functions were taken over by the new Wiltshire Council unitary authority.

== Post-abolition events ==
Wiltshire Council retained the Monkton Park building as a satellite of its main offices at County Hall, Trowbridge.

Some local services, which had been the responsibility of the district council and had passed in 2009 to Wiltshire Council, were later transferred to the larger town and parish councils. Thus, by 2019, Chippenham Town Council had taken charge of a large park, a community centre and play areas, as well as services such as grounds maintenance and street cleaning.

<doc id="449237" wikidata="Q1427973" url="?curid=449237" title="Malvern Hills District">
<text>Malvern Hills is a local government district in Worcestershire, England. Its council is based in Malvern, the district&#x27;s largest town. The district also includes the towns of Tenbury Wells and Upton-upon-Severn and a large rural area covering much of the western side of the county, including numerous villages. The district is named after the Malvern Hills, which are a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The district was formed in 1998 had different boundaries to the 1974–1998 district. In the 2021 census the population of the Malvern Hills district was 79,973.

The neighbouring districts are Wyre Forest, Wychavon, Worcester, Tewkesbury, Forest of Dean, Herefordshire and Shropshire.

==History==

On 1 April 1998 the county of Hereford and Worcester was abolished, being split into a unitary authority of Herefordshire and a two-tier non-metropolitan county of Worcestershire. The parishes from Malvern Hills district which had been the rural districts of Bromyard and Ledbury prior to 1974 were transferred to the new Herefordshire authority, whilst the parishes which had been the old Tenbury Rural District were added to Malvern Hills District from the abolished Leominster District. As such the boundary between Worcestershire and Herefordshire as re-established in 1998 is almost identical to the pre-1974 boundary, the only exception being a small area containing Park Wood which had been transferred from Mathon to West Malvern in 1986 and so went to Malvern District and Worcestershire rather than Herefordshire. Following the boundary changes in 1998, the hills after which the district is named now lie principally along its western edges.

==Governance==
Malvern Hills District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Worcestershire County Council. The whole district is covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

Since 2014 the council has shared a chief executive and other staff with neighbouring Wychavon District Council.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2019. Since 2020 the administration has been a coalition of the independents and Greens.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 1 April 1974. A shadow authority was again elected in 1997 ahead of the significant district boundary changes which came into effect on 1 April 1998. Political control of the district council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2000 have been:
===Composition===
Following the 2023 election the composition of the council was:
The independents all sit together as the &quot;Democratic Independent&quot; group, which forms the council&#x27;s administration with the Greens. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 31 councillors representing 18 wards, each electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===

The council is based at the Council House on Avenue Road in Malvern. It was built between 1874 and 1880 as a house. It later served as a school from 1909 until 1925, when it was bought by the former Malvern Urban District Council and converted to become their headquarters, passing to Malvern Hills District Council on its creation in 1974.

==Geography==
The Malvern Hills themselves form the border between, and offer scenic views over, the counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire. The district includes approximately half of the Malvern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (prior to the 1998 alterations to its boundary, it covered most of the AONB). The district bounds onto the counties of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire, as well as the Worcestershire districts of Wychavon, Worcester and Wyre Forest.

The River Teme is famous for its fishing and runs across the northern half of the district, from Tenbury Wells, to its confluence with the River Severn near Worcester, close to the site of the Battle of Worcester. Historically, the Teme Valley was famous for its orchards and hop yards, though these declined during the second half of the 20th century, with some revival since . The River Severn forms the eastern boundary of the district (with Wychavon) between Stourport and Worcester, whilst to the south of Worcester the district includes parishes to the east of the Severn; the river is also popular with anglers and has public navigation rights.

The area has a significant spa heritage and Malvern water is bottled and distributed commercially worldwide. The spa buildings (The Pump Rooms) survive at Tenbury Wells and many free spring water sources are available to the public in and around Malvern. In the east of the district is Croome Court, a significant National Trust property.

<text>Tomáš Vokoun (; born 2 July 1976) is a Czech former professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1997 to 2013, mainly with the Nashville Predators. He was selected by the Montreal Canadiens in the ninth round, 226th overall, in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft, and played one game for the team, as well as playing with the Florida Panthers, Washington Capitals, and Pittsburgh Penguins. Internationally, Vokoun played for the Czech national team at several tournaments, including the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics, winning a bronze medal in 2006, as well as gold medals at the 2005 and 2010 World Championships.

==Playing career==

=== Early career (1994–1998) ===
Vokoun was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the ninth round of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft, 226th overall. He remained in the Czech Republic for another year, playing with Poldi Kladno.

Vokoun moved to North America for the 1995–96 season and played for the Wheeling Thunderbirds of the ECHL. He was called up to the Fredericton Canadiens of the American Hockey League (AHL) and played one playoff game. Having proven himself in the ECHL, Vokoun spent the 1996–97 season in Fredericton and played in his only game for Montreal; it was not a stellar debut, however, as he allowed four goals in only 20 minutes of play against the Philadelphia Flyers.

=== Nashville Predators (1998–2007) ===
After another season with the Fredericton Canadiens, Vokoun was chosen by the Nashville Predators in the 1998 NHL Expansion Draft on 26 June 1998.

Vokoun played 37 games for Nashville in their debut season and played nine games for the Milwaukee Admirals in the International Hockey League (IHL). Although he again split time between the two clubs the following season, by 2000, Vokoun established himself in the NHL, though he initially only saw limited action as the back-up to starter Mike Dunham. In 2002, Dunham was traded to the New York Rangers for Marek Židlický, Tomáš Klouček and Rem Murray, effectively awarding Vokoun the starting job.

Vokoun&#x27;s play was solid enough in 2003–04 to send him to the All-Star Game for the first time, and his goaltending was a major factor in the Predators&#x27; first-ever playoff berth that season. The team lost in six games to the Detroit Red Wings in the first round. In game 4 of that series, played in Nashville, Vokoun earned the first-ever playoff shutout in franchise history, stopping 41 Red Wing shots.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Vokoun played 19 regular season games for HIFK in the Finnish SM-liiga, posting a .940 save percentage. In the playoffs, Vokoun did not perform as well, posting an .846 save percentage in four games, the worst in the league in that year&#x27;s playoffs.

On 10 April 2006, the Predators announced Vokoun was afflicted by thrombophlebitis of the pelvis, a blood-clotting condition. He missed the team&#x27;s remaining regular season games and the entire playoffs while he recovered by taking blood-thinning drugs and avoiding physical activity. Back-up goaltender Chris Mason took his place as the starter, but the Predators failed to advance in the playoffs, again losing in the quarter-finals. On 24 July 2006, Vokoun was cleared to resume his career and returned for the 2006–07 NHL season. However, at the beginning of the season, Vokoun injured his thumb during a game and was required to have surgery. Pins were put in this thumb, and he played with the pins and a brace on his thumb.

=== Florida Panthers (2007–2011) ===

On the day of the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, Vokoun was traded to the Florida Panthers in exchange for a first-round selection in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, a second-round selection in the 2007 draft (58th overall) and a conditional second-round selection in either 2007 or 2008. Vokoun&#x27;s nine-year tenure in Nashville had him setting many of the Predators&#x27; goaltending records, all of which were overtaken by Pekka Rinne in the following decade.

Vokoun was selected to play for the Eastern Conference team in the 2008 NHL All Star Game in Atlanta.

During the 2008–09 NHL season, Vokoun recorded 26 wins for the Panthers as they battled for their first playoff berth since 2000. Although they ultimately fell short, the Panthers&#x27; being in position to qualify was due in large part to the goaltending of Vokoun and fellow goaltender Craig Anderson.

Vokoun was injured by teammate Keith Ballard in a game on 30 November 2009, when Ballard hit Vokoun with an errant stick in the head. Vokoun was carried off the ice on a stretcher and was treated at a nearby hospital for an ear laceration. Vokoun had just given up a goal to Ilya Kovalchuk of the Atlanta Thrashers and Ballard went to break his stick on the goal post in frustration, but caught Vokoun instead.

=== Washington and Pittsburgh (2011–2014) ===

Vokoun signed a one-year contract with the Washington Capitals on 2 July 2011 worth $1.5 million. Vokoun had a rough 2011–12 NHL season with the Capitals, as it was plagued by injury and inconsistent performance.

With Washington resorting to youngster Braden Holtby as their starting goaltender, Vokoun was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins on 4 June 2012 in exchange for a seventh-round pick in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. The following day, Vokoun signed to a two-year, $4 million contract. Since his customary sweater number 29 was being worn by Marc-André Fleury, Vokoun opted to wear number 92 with the Penguins; he became the first goaltender since Daren Puppa to wear a sweater number from 90 to 98.

On 30 March 2013, Vokoun set a personal best and Pittsburgh Penguins individual franchise record shutout streak of 187:30. He had two consecutive shutouts (on 28 March against the Winnipeg Jets and on 30 March against the New York Islanders) and a combined shutout with Marc-André Fleury on 26 March against the Montreal Canadiens. Vokoun played the third period to complete the shutout after Fleury was injured at the end of the second period. On 9 May 2013, Vokoun made his first playoff start in six seasons, a 31-save shutout against the New York Islanders in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Quarter-finals.

Vokoun was sidelined indefinitely after undergoing surgery to dissolve another blood clot in his pelvis during the 2013 pre-season. On 21 January 2014, it was reported Vokoun would begin skating in practice again, with no timetable as to his possible return. On 15 December 2014, Vokoun announced his retirement.

==International play==





Vokoun has represented the Czech Republic many times over the course of his playing career. His first international experience came with the under-20 team at the 1996 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where the Czechs finished in fourth place. His first senior experience came at the 2003 IIHF World Championship, where the Czechs again finished in fourth place. Overall, he has played for the Czechs at four IIHF World Championships, two Winter Olympic Games and also in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. He backstopped the Czechs to a third-place finish at the World Cup, gold medals at the 2005 and 2010 World Championships and won bronze with the team at the 2006 Olympics in Turin.

<text>Wyre Forest is a large, semi-natural (partially unmanaged) woodland and forest measuring which straddles the borders of Worcestershire and Shropshire, England. Knowles Mill, a former corn mill owned by the National Trust lies within the forest.

==Natural history==
The forest covers an area in local terms of 2,634 hectares (6,509 acres, ) and is noted for its variety of wildlife. Although now the Wyre Forest has been much deforested, it still extends from east of the A442 at Shatterford, north of Kidderminster in the east, almost to Cleobury Mortimer in the west and from Upper Arley in the north to Areley Kings, near Stourport in the south. It is one of the largest remaining ancient woodlands in Britain. Forestry England looks after around half of today&#x27;s forest. Around two-thirds of the forest has been designated as an SSSI (1,753.7 Ha), while a further fifth (549 Ha) is listed as a national nature reserve. Dowles Brook flows through the heart of the forest, and the A456 road also runs through the southern edge of the woodland.

It is one of the largest areas of semi-natural (partially unmanaged) woodland in the UK. Bird species to be found in the forest include hawfinch, dipper, wood warbler, common crossbill, spotted flycatcher, pied flycatcher, common redstart and long-eared owl, among many other woodland animals and plants. The small but colourful moth &quot;Oecophora bractella&quot; has one of its few English populations here, and does not seem to occur much further northwards.

The forest&#x27;s adders have been the subject of a notable study by Sylvia Sheldon.

On 9 April 2024, a family of 6 Eurasian Beavers &quot;(Castor Fiber)&quot; were reintroduced to a tributary of Dowles Brook, within a five-hectare enclosure spanning the stream and surrounding woodland.

==History==

The historic extent of the Wyre Forest is debatable. It is thought that it once stretched from Worcester to Bridgnorth along the west bank of the River Severn, but evidence for that is thin. Wyre Forest has none of the legal peculiarities of a historic forest at all, instead has those of a chase (of common land) with hunting rights belonging to the Mortimer family, who had the title Earl of March from 1328, as holders for centuries of the manor and liberty of Cleobury Mortimer, which technically still enjoys such hunting rights.

How far north the Mortimer family&#x27;s hunting rights extended is debatable, but it may have included the whole area in south east Shropshire of which they were overlords at the time of Domesday Book. While they may have had hunting rights there, much of the woodland in fact belonged to other manors, such as Upper Arley and Kinlet. A large tract of woodland on the north side of the Dowles Brook was Kingswood, a detached township of the parish of Stottesdon. The town of Bewdley, a Mortimer foundation, may have been cut out of the forest. Far Forest was until recent times part of the borough of Bewdley, though separated from the rest of it by New Parks, which were in Rock parish. Most rights to land in the forest belonged to these medieval manors.

The rights of the Mortimer family passed to the crown as a result of the accession of Edward IV, who was (amongst other things) previously Earl of March to the crown. Its description as &#x27;forest&#x27; probably dates from that period.

The extent of woodland two to three centuries ago was probably similar to that today. The manor of Cleobury Mortimer was alienated in the 16th century, leaving the crown only with the manor of Bewdley and Far Forest. Historical references to the Wyre Forest in this period seem to relate to this rather smaller area owned by the crown. In fact the crown&#x27;s involvement was slight as its rights were leased to local gentlemen. One series of leases related to the manor of Bewdley, but another concerned something called the &#x27;Wyre Forest&#x27;. This may have related to Far Forest, but that is not clear.
During the 16th century, coal mining throughout the Wyre was prevalent. Industry in the Wyre Forest continued throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. During those centuries, the forest was intensively managed as coppice to provide cordwood for the production of charcoal. The charcoal was used to fuel iron forges at Cleobury Mortimer, and at Wilden and elsewhere in the Stour valley. These supplied iron from manufacture into finished iron goods mainly in the Black Country. Coppicing in the Wyre also provided industry to towns such as Bewdley, where local Tanneries profited from the woodland. Charcoal burning continued into the 20th century.

A branch of the Severn Valley Railway, known as the Tenbury and Bewdley Railway once ran through the Wyre Forest. It branched from the main line north of Bewdley station and crossed the River Severn at Dowles Bridge, the supports of which still remain. The trackbed of the railway now forms part of National Cycle Route 45.

== Knowles Mill ==

One of nine possible mills that historically worked on Dowles Brook, Knowles Mill was built in the eighteenth century, and was later modified in the nineteenth century. The surviving building is two storeys high and the site also preserves an overshot mill wheel made of iron and a great spur wheel, alongside other remnant machinery. The first record of a mill on the site dates to 1757 when it was listed as for sale in a local newspaper. The mill and its surroundings are owned by the National Trust.

==Namesake==
The Wyre Forest District of Worcestershire, containing the towns Kidderminster, Bewdley and Stourport on Severn, takes its name from the forest. However, just over half the woodland is not in the district, and instead is in Shropshire, to the north.

<text>Wychavon () is a local government district in Worcestershire, England. The largest towns therein are Evesham and Droitwich Spa; the council is based in the town of Pershore. The district also includes numerous villages and surrounding rural areas, and includes part of the Cotswolds, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The district&#x27;s name references the Saxon Kingdom of Hwicce and the River Avon. The population in was .

The neighbouring districts are Malvern Hills, Worcester, Wyre Forest, Bromsgrove, Redditch, Stratford-on-Avon, Cotswold, and Tewkesbury.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of five former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Droitwich Municipal Borough
*Droitwich Rural District (except parish of Warndon, which went to Worcester)
*Evesham Municipal Borough
*Evesham Rural District
*Pershore Rural District (except parish of St Peter the Great County, which went to Worcester)
The name Wychavon was coined for the new district. &quot;Wych&quot; phonetically recalls the Saxon Kingdom of Hwicce, and &quot;Avon&quot; is for the River Avon.

==Governance==
Wychavon District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Worcestershire County Council. The whole district is covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

Since 2014 the council has shared a chief executive and other staff with neighbouring Malvern Hills District Council.


===Political control===
The council has been under Conservative majority control since 1999.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1999 have been:
===Composition===
Following the 2023 election the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 43 councillors representing 27 wards, each electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council is based at Pershore Civic Centre on Queen Elizabeth Drive, which was purpose-built for the council in 1991. The council also maintains offices in Droitwich and Evesham.

== Civil parishes ==

The whole district is divided into civil parishes. The parish councils for Droitwich Spa, Evesham and Pershore have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Broadway is a post town, but has not been declared a town by its parish council. The Wychavon district includes the following civil parishes:

<text>Antananarivo Province is a former province of Madagascar with an area of . It had a population of 5,370,900 in 2004. Its capital was Antananarivo, which is also the capital of the country. Established in 1965, it was the most important province of Madagascar in terms of industrial production. It was one of the most literate provinces and was dominated by the Merina people. Along with the other five provinces, it was abolished in 2007 after a referendum in favour of creation of smaller regions to help in development was approved. It was badly affected by plagues in the 20th century. In 2002 a state of emergency was proclaimed by the then president Didier Ratsiraka. The events that followed led to the other five provinces announcing the creation of a new republic that would have excluded Antananarivo Province. Peace was restored only when Marc Ravalomanana was installed as the country&#x27;s president.

== History and location ==

The province was administered by a provincial council whose members were elected by the local citizens for a term of five years. The council consisted of a governor and 12 general commissioners at maximum. The province used to be the most literate one in Madagascar and offered the most employment opportunities. As of 1997, only 34% of the population was illiterate and about 30% of the inhabitants had received education up to secondary level. In the same year about 42% of the country&#x27;s total civil servants were working in the province and two-thirds of the province&#x27;s inhabitants were above the poverty line. This was due to the presence of the country&#x27;s capital in the province . The province was located on a plateau generally called &quot;The Blue Forest&quot;. It was the most important political and commercial centre in Madagascar. The French colonial authority had established the province in 1946. During 1993 to 2001 the rate of people below poverty line in the province decreased steadily from 63.4% in 1993 to 61.8% in 1997, then to 57.1% in 1999 and finally 48.3% in 2001. In 1993 only Mahajanga Province was better in terms of percentage of poor population at 47.9%. In all the later surveys Antananarivo Province emerged as the best in terms of people above poverty. Around 30% of the Madagascar&#x27;s total population lived in the province. In 2003 a research paper titled &quot;Madagascar: Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper&quot; and published by the International Monetary Fund revealed that about 92% of the province&#x27;s households had access to potable water. Since it lies in Southern Hemisphere the province experiences winter season from April to October and humid summers during the rest of the year.

Except for Antsiranana Province, Antananarivo Province bordered all of the country&#x27;s other provinces. It was surrounded by Mahajanga Province in the north, Toamasina Province in the east, Fianarantsoa Province in the south and Toliara Province in the west. Antananarivo was the only landlocked province of Madagascar. Several plagues have affected the province. It was badly affected by plagues in 1924–25 and 1933–37. The earlier one caused 650 deaths in the entire province. A cholera epidemic in 1999–2000 which broke out in Mahajanga province also affected Antananarivo province. A malaria epidemic in 1987–88 claimed several lives in the capital.

== Political instability ==

This is the home province of the noted politicians Didier Ratsiraka, Norbert Ratsirahonana and Marc Ravalomanana. Ravalomanana was born in the village of Imerinkasinina, in Manjakandriana District of the province. Before becoming the country&#x27;s president, he had served as the mayor of Antananarivo. The province was dominated in population by the Merina, the island&#x27;s largest and most politically prominent ethnic group. In 2002 a state of emergency was proclaimed by the then president Didier Ratsiraka after Marc Ravalomanana announced that he had won a majority in the presidential election held in December 2001. However, the initial results of the election suggested that a second round was necessary. This led to severe political tension and public protests. The provinces supporting the presidency of Ratsiraka announced the creation of a new republic which excluded Antananarivo Province. In coastal areas the Merina people were subject to ethnic violence. Ratsiraka left the country and fled to France once the news of plans to assassinate him surfaced. In April 2002, the High Constitutional Court of Madagascar declared Ravalomanana the winner. Following the announcement he was appointed as the country&#x27;s president. and peace was restored within the country.

== Abolition ==

The President (PDS – Président de la Délégation Spéciale) of the province was Emile Rakotomalala. The provinces were abolished following the results of Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2007 which led to the formation of 22 smaller areas (&quot;faritra&quot; or regions) to facilitate regional development.

== Administrative divisions ==

<text>Antsiranana is a former province of Madagascar with an area of 43,406 km2. It had a population of 1,188,425 (July 2001). Its capital was Antsiranana. A diversity of ethnic groups are found in the province, including Anjoaty, Sakalava, Antakarana, Tsimihety, Antemoro, Betsimisaraka, Antandroy, etc.

==History==
A major battle took place at Diego-Suárez (now Antsiranana), the largest city in Antsiranana Province, in May 1942. &quot;Fierce fighting&quot; in the area saw over 500 Allied casualties. On 29 May, Japanese submarine I-10 surfaced off the coast and launched a Nakajima A6M2-N reconnaissance aircraft over the port. Operation Ironclad was relaunched, after being stalled, on 22 June to counterattack, with supporting forces from the East African Brigade Group and later the Rhodesian 27th Infantry Brigade in July.

==Geography==
Antsiranana Province bordered Toamasina Province to the southeast and Mahajanga Province to the southwest. The province has been described as being &quot;virtually isolated&quot;, because of Mt Tsaratanana, the highest peak, being situated in it at above sea level. The valleys are fertile, with tropical crops cultivated. There is a natural harbour at Antsiranana which contains a significant naval base.

Ankarana Reserve, in the northwest, was established in 1956. It is a small, partially vegetated plateau composed of 150-million-year-old middle Jurassic limestone. With an average annual rainfall of about , the underlying rocks are susceptible to erosion, thereby producing caves and underground rivers—a karst topography. The rugged relief and the dense vegetation have helped protect the region from human intrusion. The Ankarana Reserve is an important refuge for significant populations of the crowned lemur (&quot;Eulemur coronatus&quot;), Sanford&#x27;s brown lemur (&quot;Eulemur sanfordi&quot;) and other mammal species. Species of &quot;Podocarpus humbertii&quot; is found in dry lowland deciduous forest, sub-humid forest, and in wooded heath on mountain summits of gneiss and granite in the province between 1600 and 2410 metres.

A large bay, known as the Bay of Antisiranana forms part of the coastline in the north. Rich in biodiversity, in recent decades it has become a hotspot for conservationists. Many species found in the Bobaomby in particular, such as the Madagascan tree boa, the Madagascan ground boa and the crowned lemur have made the IUCN Red List as endangered or vulnerable. In July 2007, the Ministry of the Environment and Forests transferred management to a local committee. The Montagne des Français forest is now also under protection.

==Administrative divisions==
Antsiranana Province was divided into two regions - Diana and Sava. These two regions became the first-level administrative divisions when the provinces were abolished in 2009. They are subdivided into nine districts:
* Diana Region
** 1. Ambanja District (Ambanja)
** 2. Ambilobe District (Ambilobe)
** 5. Antsiranana Rural
** 6. Antsiranana
** 7. Nosy Be District (Nosy Be)
* Sava Region
** 3. Andapa District (Andapa)
** 4. Antalaha District (Antalaha)
** 8. Sambava District (Sambava)
** 9. Vohemar District (Vohemar)
==Economy and health==
Antsiranana Province is known for its sapphires. A number of Catholic schools set up by missionaries in the province are still scattered about.

Rural poverty is a major problem in the region, with 69.2% of the population reported to be suffering in 2001 according to reports by the International Monetary Fund. An unusual percentage of children in the province have been reported to be suffering from anemia, as high as 70% in some parts.

<text>Fianarantsoa Province is a former province of Madagascar. It has an area of 103,272 km2 and population of 3,366,291 (July 2001 estimate). Its capital was Fianarantsoa. The province along with the 5 other was abolished in 2007 in favour of creation of smaller regions to facilitate administration.

Apart from the capital the major towns were Andohapatsakana, Alakamisy, Fianarantsoa and Fanjakana. The province was home to four major national parks: Ranomafana National Park, Midongy Du Sud, Isalo National Park, and Andringitra. It was frequently referred by its abbreviated form of &quot;Fianar&quot;. Fianarantsoa means &quot;Good education&quot;.

== Geography and demographics ==

Fianarantsoa Province bordered the Toamasina Province in the north, Antananarivo Province in the northwest, Toliara Province in the west and Indian Ocean in the east. 60,000 people spoke the southern Malagasy Betsimisaraka language. In spite of presence of rice producing areas a very high majority of the population lived in poverty. The province&#x27;s economy suffered greatly due to environmental issues and poor agricultural practices. Around 75% of the province&#x27;s population lived below the poverty line. The province recorded the highest fertility rate in Madagascar. The average fertility rate per woman was greater than 6. The combined population of the Antananarivo and Fianarantsoa was more than that of the remaining provinces. It was the stronghold of former president Marc Ravalomanana. The major ethnic groups were Betsimisaraka, Betsileo, Antaisaka and Bara. Betsimisaraka and Antaisaka inhabited the east coast of the province while Betsileo people lived in the southern parts of the province.

== Fauna ==

Several shrew species like &quot;Microgale cowani&quot;, &quot;Microgale gracilis&quot;, &quot;Microgale gymnorhyncha&quot;, &quot;Microgale longicaudata&quot;, &quot;Microgale principula&quot;, &quot;Microgale pusilla&quot;, &quot;Microgale taiva&quot; and &quot;Microgale talazaci&quot; were endemic to the province. Many snake species were also endemic to the province.

== Education ==

Illiteracy was also an important issue. In 2002 around 1200 unopened schools were located in the province. Most of them were constructed by the government. The survival rates were very low. To increase the literacy rate the government had subsidised private schools.

== Abolition ==

The province&#x27;s president was Fidy Mpanjato Rakotonarivo (since 2005). The provinces were abolished following the results of Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2007 which led to the formation of 22 smaller areas (&quot;faritra&quot; or regions) to facilitate regional development.

== Administrative divisions ==
Fianarantsoa Province was divided into five regions of Madagascar - Atsimo-Atsinanana, Amoron&#x27;i Mania, Haute Matsiatra, Ihorombe and Vatovavy-Fitovinany. These five regions became the first-level administrative divisions when the provinces were abolished in 2009. They are sub-divided into 23 districts:
* Atsimo-Atsinanana region:
** 5. Befotaka
** 7. Farafangana
** 19. Midongy-Sud
** 21. Vangaindrano
** 23. Vondrozo
* Amoron&#x27;i Mania region:
** 2. Ambatofinandrahana
** 4. Ambositra
** 6. Fandriana
** 17. Manandriana
* Haute Matsiatra region:
** 1. Ambalavao
** 3. Ambohimahasoa
** 8. Fianarantsoa Rural
** 9. Fianarantsoa Urban
** 13. Ikalamavony
* Ihorombe region:
** 10. Iakora District (Iakora)
** 12. Ihosy District (Ihosy)
** 15. Ivohibe District (Ivohibe)
* Vatovavy-Fitovinany region:
** 11. Ifanadiana
** 14. Ikongo
** 16. Manakara-Atsimo
** 18. Mananjary
** 20. Nosy Varika
** 22. Vohipeno

<text>Mahajanga was a former province of Madagascar that had an area of 150,023 km2. It had a population of 1,896,000 (2004). Its capital was Mahajanga, the second largest city in Madagascar.

Except for Fianarantsoa, Mahajanga Province bordered all of the country&#x27;s other provinces–Antsiranana in the north, Toamasina in the east, Antananarivo in the southeast and Toliara in the southwest. Sea cucumbers were an important commercial product produced in the province.

In 1999, cholera epidemic broke out in the province. It infected 380 people and claimed 26 lives. The epidemic spread towards the southern Antananarivo and Toliara provinces. The province was hit by Cyclone Kamisy in June 1984. A large percentage of the province&#x27;s population lived below the poverty line.

A large area of the province was covered by rain forests. It had a rich variety of flora and fauna. Several lemur species were endemic to the province. Assassin spiders were discovered in the province&#x27;s Baie de Baly National Park. Another important national park is Ankarafantsika National Park. The national parks attract many tourists and served as an important economic advantage to the province. A Natural Science Center was created in Mahajanga in 1985.

Rice, cotton, tobacco and manioc were the important agricultural products. The province offered limited opportunities for higher and technical education. The health related facilities are limited. Anemia in children was common and the province offered poor transportation and security related facilities.

==Abolition==
The provinces were abolished following the results of Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2007 which led to the formation of 23 smaller areas (&quot;faritra&quot; or regions) to facilitate regional development.

== Administrative divisions ==
Mahajanga Province was divided into four regions - Betsiboka, Boeny, Melaky and Sofia. These four regions became the first-level administrative divisions when the provinces were abolished in 2009. They are subdivided into 21 districts:
* Betsiboka region:
** 10. Kandreho District
** 11. Maevatanana District
** 21. Tsaratanana District

<text>The Toamasina Province is a former province of Madagascar with an area of 71,911 km2. It had a population of 2,855,600 (2004). Its capital was Toamasina, the most important seaport of the country. The province was also known as Tamatave Province.

Except for Toliara, Toamasina Province bordered all of the country&#x27;s other provinces; Antsiranana in the north, Mahajanga in the northwest, Antananarivo in the southwest and Fianarantsoa in the south. Northern Betsimisaraka Malagasy and Southern Betsimisaraka Malagasy languages were widely spoken.

Despite the production of exportable crops the people inhabiting the rural regions of the province were mostly poor. In terms of rural poverty the province was only better than the Toliara province. In urban areas the condition was comparatively better and the percentage of people living below the poverty line was the least in the whole of Madagascar. The country&#x27;s largest harbour–Toamasina Harbour was located in the province. Vanilla farming was also an important activity.

In 2002 a state of emergency was declared by the then president Didier Ratsiraka after his rival Marc Ravalomanana announced that he had won the majority in the presidential elections held in December 2001. Major politicians of the provinces favouring Ratsiraka as the president met in Toamasina where they announced the creation of a new republic that would have excluded the landlocked Antananarivo Province. Toamasina favoured Ratsiraka as the president. Political tension prompted ethnic clashes and in the coastal provinces the Merina people were subject to attacks. Murders of people belonging to the Merina community were also reported. Peace was restored only when Ravalomanana was installed the country&#x27;s president and Ratsiraka left the country.

Lake Rasoabe and Ranomainty were located in the province. The coastal areas of the province were covered with dense rain forests and the province had a rich variety of flora and fauna. Lemurs were also found.

==Abolition==
The provinces were abolished following the results of Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2007 which led to the formation of 22 smaller areas (&quot;faritra&quot; or regions) to facilitate regional development.

== Administrative divisions ==
Toliara Province was divided into three regions of Madagascar - Alaotra-Mangoro, Analanjirofo and Atsinanana. These three regions became the first-level administrative divisions when the provinces were abolished in 2009. They are sub-divided into 18 districts:
* Alaotra-Mangoro region

<doc id="449268" wikidata="Q462925" url="?curid=449268" title="Randy Moss">
<text>Randy Gene Moss (born February 13, 1977) is an American former professional football wide receiver who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons with the Minnesota Vikings, Oakland Raiders, New England Patriots, Tennessee Titans, and San Francisco 49ers. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he holds the NFL single-season touchdown reception record (23 in 2007), as well as the NFL single-season touchdown reception record for a rookie (17 in 1998).

All-time, Moss ranks second in career touchdown receptions (leading the league five times in touchdown receptions, third most all-time) as well as fourth in career receiving yards. In addition to possessing extraordinary speed at his size (4.25 40-yard dash at 6 ft 4 in) and superior leaping ability (43-inch vertical), he was famously known for often securing spectacular contested catches in tight coverage by physically overpowering defenders. The term &quot;mossed&quot;, referring to this ability, has since become a common term in the football lexicon.

Moss played college football for the Marshall Thundering Herd and earned Unanimous All-American honors in 1997. A six-time Pro Bowl and four-time first-team All-Pro selection, Moss was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the first round of the 1998 NFL draft, where he set the single-season record for touchdown receptions in a rookie season and was named NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. In his first stint with the Vikings, Moss caught 90 touchdown receptions in his first seven seasons, as well as having more than 1,200 yards in each of his first six seasons. He was traded in 2005 to the Oakland Raiders, where he experienced a slump in play, notably due to the lack of talent surrounding him and perceived decline.

In 2007, Moss was then traded to the New England Patriots, where he experienced a career resurgence and set the single-season record for total touchdown receptions. That season, he helped lead the Patriots to a record breaking 16–0 regular season record. During both the 1998 and 2007 seasons, Moss was the catalyst of the two highest scoring offenses of all time at the time they occurred (556 points in 1998, 589 points in 2007), now ranking sixth and second all-time. In October 2010, Moss returned to the Vikings in a trade from the Patriots but was waived less than a month later and then claimed by the Tennessee Titans. After sitting out the 2011 season, Moss signed a one-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers in 2012 before retiring following the season.

He played in two Super Bowl games, XLII with the Patriots and XLVII with the 49ers, both losses. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018, and is a member of the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team and the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. 

Following his playing career, he began working for ESPN as a studio analyst for its &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot; and &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot; programs. In 2022, Moss left &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot;.
==Early life==
Moss was born in Rand, West Virginia. He attended DuPont High School, one of two schools that later consolidated into Riverside High School, where he excelled in football, basketball, baseball, and track. Randy was also on the school&#x27;s debate team. On the football field, Moss led the DuPont Panthers to back-to-back state championships in 1992 and 1993. He was a star at wide receiver, but also played free safety, returned kickoffs and punts, and was the team&#x27;s kicker and punter. In 1994, he was honored with the Harrison H. Kennedy Award as the West Virginia Football Player of the Year. &quot;Parade&quot; magazine named him to their annual All-American high school football team in 1995 and in 2009 named him one of the 50 greatest high school football players of all time. At DuPont, he was a teammate of future Chicago Bears linebacker Bobbie Howard.

In addition to playing football at DuPont, Moss was twice named West Virginia Player of the Year in basketball (in 1994 when he was co-player of the year and in 1995), where he was a teammate of future NBA player Jason Williams. In his senior season of basketball, Moss averaged 30.2 points, 13.7 rebounds, 5.1 steals, 3.8 blocks, and 3.1 assists while shooting 60% from field; he scored a school-record 1,713 career points.

As a sophomore in 1992, at the age of 15, Moss joined the track &amp; field team and was the West Virginia state champion in the 100 and 200 meters with times of 10.94 seconds and 21.95 seconds, respectively. This was the only year he competed on the school&#x27;s track team, but he would later join the Marshall track team and lower his 200 m time to 21.15 seconds. He also played center field for the baseball team.

==College career==
Moss&#x27;s dream was to play for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, but he also considered going to Ohio State, where his half-brother, Eric, had played offensive tackle. Former Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz said &quot;Randy Moss was the best high school football player I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden said &quot;He was as good as Deion Sanders. Deion&#x27;s my measuring stick for athletic ability, and this kid was just a bigger Deion.&quot;

After originally signing a letter of intent to play college football with Notre Dame in 1995, Moss took part in a racially charged fight at his high school that left one person hospitalized. On March 23, 1995, Moss had backed a friend in a hallway fight against a white student who had allegedly used racist comments towards Randy&#x27;s friend. Moss was initially charged with a felony for kicking the student, but it was later reduced to a misdemeanor. On August 1, 1995, Moss pleaded guilty to two counts of misdemeanor battery and was sentenced to 30 days behind bars at the South-Central Regional Jail in Charleston, West Virginia. He served 3 days in jail starting that night and would be required to serve the remaining 27 days within the following 18 months, after he completed his freshman year in college. Moss was expelled from DuPont and completed his education at Cabell Alternative School.

Notre Dame subsequently denied his enrollment application, but this did not stop another high-profile college football program from giving him a chance. Notre Dame officials suggested he attend Florida State due to the reputation of its coach, Bobby Bowden, for handling troubled players.

===Freshman (1995)===
Because of his signed letter of intent at Notre Dame, the NCAA considered him a transfer student to Florida State, so he had to redshirt the 1995 football season.

===Redshirt freshman season (1996)===
In 1996, while serving his 30-day jail sentence in a work-release program from 1995, Moss tested positive for marijuana, thus violating his probation, and was dismissed from Florida State. He served an additional 60 days in jail for the probation violation.

Ultimately, Moss transferred to Marshall University, about an hour&#x27;s drive from his home. Because Marshall was then a Division I-AA school, NCAA rules allowed him to transfer there without losing any further eligibility. In 1996, he set the NCAA Division I-AA records for the most games with a touchdown catch in a season (14), most consecutive games with a touchdown catch (13), most touchdown passes caught in a season (28 – tying Jerry Rice&#x27;s 1984 record), and most receiving yards gained by a freshman in a season (1,709 on 78 catches), a record which still stands. Moss was also the leading kickoff returner in Division I-AA on the season, with 612 total yards and a 34.0-yard average. The 1996 Marshall Thundering Herd went undefeated and won the Division I-AA title, with Moss having four touchdown receptions in the 1996 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship Game against Montana. It was Marshall&#x27;s last season before moving to Division I-A.

At the Southern Conference indoor track championships, Moss ran the 200 meters in 21.15 seconds, missing the conference record by only .02 seconds. Although Moss had not raced competitively for four years, his time was one of the best in the country that year.

===Sophomore season (1997)===

In the 1997 season, Marshall&#x27;s first in Division I-A, Moss and quarterback Chad Pennington were the centerpiece of an explosive offense that led the Thundering Herd to the Mid-American Conference title. Moss caught 26 touchdown passes that season, at the time a Division I-A record, and was a first-team All-American.

The first game of the season was on the road against the West Virginia Mountaineers where Marshall lost 42–31. The second game of the season saw Moss pick up right where he left off in 1996. Facing Army, Moss had five receptions for 186 yards and two touchdowns. Against Army, Moss&#x27;s first touchdown went for 79 yards and the second touchdown marked a career-long of 90 yards.

A week later, Moss posted his third career 200+ yard receiving game, against Kent State in a 42–17 victory. Two weeks after that was his fourth and final 200+ yard game in college, recording 13 catches for 205 yards and a Marshall single-game record of five touchdown receptions against Ball State.

In the 1997 Ford Motor City Bowl against Ole Miss, Moss added his 26th touchdown of the season on Marshall&#x27;s first offensive play from scrimmage. He streaked down the right sideline and caught an 80-yard touchdown pass from Pennington to tie the score at 7–7. NCAA rules at the time did not allow for statistics from bowl games to be combined with regular-season stats, so the touchdown did not officially increase his season touchdown record. The two teams traded the lead several times in the fourth quarter before Ole Miss running back Deuce McAllister scored on a 1-yard touchdown run with 31 seconds to play, giving them a 34–31 lead. Trying to pull out a last-second win, Pennington connected with Moss on a 40-yard pass on the final play of the game, but he was stripped of the ball as time expired. Moss finished the game with six receptions for 173 yards.

Moss finished his career at Marshall having scored at least one touchdown in all 28 games that he played. He won the Fred Biletnikoff Award as the season&#x27;s outstanding receiver regardless of position, and was a finalist for the 1997 Heisman Trophy, finishing fourth in the balloting. He was a Consensus All-American and won MAC Offensive Player of the Year. A controversial comment was made by Moss in 1997 at a ceremony at Marshall University where he was commenting in regards to the 1970 plane crash that killed most their football team that the crash &quot;was a tragedy, but it really wasn&#x27;t nothing big&quot;. Moss later claimed that the quotes were taken out of context. Nate Ruffin, a surviving member of the 1970 football team, later met with Randy Moss.

==Professional career==
===1998 NFL Draft===
Moss skipped his junior and senior seasons at Marshall and entered the NFL Draft. He did not attend the NFL Combine, opting instead for an individual workout at Marshall&#x27;s pro day. After the pro day was complete, Marshall head coach Bob Pruett informed the media that Moss had run two 40 yard sprints which timed at 4.24 and 4.28 by scouts&#x27; hand timers. Moss also posted a vertical leap of 47 inches. Numerous teams had scouts on hand with many noting the work-out was jaw dropping, with one Cowboys scout naming Moss the &quot;most gifted prospect in football history&quot;.

During the 1998 NFL draft, Moss, who was projected as a high first-round pick, was taken by the Minnesota Vikings with the 21st overall pick after a number of NFL clubs—even those in need of a WR—were concerned with Moss&#x27;s well-documented legal problems. Before the draft Moss was quoted as saying teams that passed on him &quot;will regret it once they see what kind of a player I am and what kind of guy I really am.&quot; The team most often cited for passing on Moss is the Dallas Cowboys. Moss grew up a Cowboys fan and wanted to play for the Cowboys. The Cowboys wanted Moss, but because of many off-field incidents of their own, team owner and GM Jerry Jones did not feel the team could draft Moss. Moss felt that the Cowboys lied to him because they had told him they would draft him. On draft day, Dallas went so far as to have a scout in Charleston, West Virginia, the same town where Moss and his mother were watching the draft. Dallas star receiver Michael Irvin even called to apologize to Moss, because Irvin&#x27;s own off-field problems were a main reason Moss was not drafted by Dallas. After the draft, Moss made a point of beating the Cowboys any time he faced them, getting his first opportunity to do so in Week 13 of his rookie season. In a game held at Texas Stadium, Moss torched Dallas with a 163-yard, 3-receptions for 3-touchdowns performance.

After the draft, Moss signed a 4-year, $4.5 million contract that included an additional $4 million in bonuses and incentives. As part of the deal, he received a $2 million signing bonus. Moss originally wore #18 in training camp (a number he would eventually wear for Oakland) but switched to the more conventional #84 before the regular season began.

===Minnesota Vikings===

====1998 season====
In 1998, Moss helped the Vikings to become the number 1 rated offense ever at the time, setting the single-season record for scoring (later surpassed by the 2007 New England Patriots, a team that also featured Moss) with 556 points.

The Vikings opened the season with a 31–7 rout against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Moss&#x27;s first NFL game would also be his first multi-touchdown game as he recorded four receptions for 95 yards and two touchdowns. His first NFL reception came on the third play of the game on an 11-yard pass from Brad Johnson. His first touchdown was a 48-yard reception He added a 31-yard touchdown reception on the Vikings&#x27; first possession of the second quarter to give the Vikings a 21–0 lead.

His first &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game came in Week 5 against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. He had five receptions for 190 yards and two touchdowns, including touchdown receptions of 52 yards and 44 yards, and two other receptions of 46 yards and 41 yards. He also had a 75-yard touchdown catch on the Vikings&#x27; first possession of the game that was nullified due to an offensive holding penalty.

In Week 12, against the Packers in a second divisional matchup, Moss had eight receptions for 153 receiving yards and a touchdown in the 28–14 victory. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against Green Bay. In Week 13, against the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day, Moss finished with three catches for 163 yards and three touchdowns all for 50+ yards as the Vikings beat the Cowboys 46–36. Moss was the first rookie to score three touchdowns on Thanksgiving. He also caught a pass for a 2-point conversion, AND picked up 50 yards on a defensive pass-interference penalty on Dallas. For that Thanksgiving game, Moss earned another NFC Offensive Player of the Week nomination. His last catch in the previous week&#x27;s game, and his first catch in the following week were also touchdowns, giving him five touchdown receptions on five consecutive catches. (Although the NFL does not keep records for consecutive catches resulting in touchdowns.) In the following week after the Thanksgiving game, this time against the Chicago Bears, Moss had another three-touchdown performance in the 48–22 victory.

The Vikings finished with a 15–1 record and were in position to represent the NFC in Super Bowl XXXIII. Moss had four receptions for 71 receiving yards and a touchdown in the 41–21 victory over the Arizona Cardinals in the Divisional Round. However, the Atlanta Falcons stunned the Vikings by winning the 1998 NFC Championship Game 30–27 in overtime. Moss had six receptions for 75 yards and a touchdown in the loss.

At the end of the 1998 regular season, Moss was named to the Pro Bowl, earned first team All-Pro honors, and won NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year for his rookie-record and league-leading 17 touchdown receptions and the third-highest receiving yardage (1,313) total. As a rookie, he finished third in voting for MVP and Offensive Player of the Year. He was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team for 1998.

====1999 season====
In Week 4, Moss had four receptions for 120 receiving yards and two touchdowns in the 21–14 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The game against Tampa Bay started a three-game streak of going for at least 120 receiving yards for Moss, with 122 against the Chicago Bears the following week and 125 in the game after that against the Detroit Lions. In Week 10, against the Chicago Bears, Moss had 12 receptions for a career-high 204 receiving yards in the 27–24 victory. Moss earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game verses the Bears. In the following game, he had seven receptions for 127 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown in the 35–27 victory over the San Diego Chargers. In Week 15, against the Green Bay Packers, he had five receptions for 131 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in the 24–20 victory. In Week 16, against the New York Giants, he threw a touchdown pass to Cris Carter in the 34–17 victory. In the regular season finale against the Detroit Lions, he had five receptions for 155 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown in the 24–17 victory.

Overall, Moss had another impressive season, catching 80 passes for 1,413 yards and 11 touchdowns, including a punt return for a touchdown. He went on to record five receptions for 127 yards and a touchdown in the Vikings 27–10 NFC Wild Card Round playoff win over the Dallas Cowboys. Minnesota lost in the Divisional Round to the St. Louis Rams 49–37, despite Moss catching nine passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns. Moss was fined $40,000, which was later reduced to $25,000, during that game due to squirting an NFL referee with a water bottle. There was a stipulation that he would have to pay the difference in addition to any other fine if he had another run-in with the league.

Moss earned his second straight Pro Bowl appearance, and turned in a record-breaking performance. He had nine receptions for a Pro Bowl record 212 yards and was given the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award.

====2000 season====
The 2000 season featured second-year quarterback Daunte Culpepper leading the team. Culpepper had been the team&#x27;s first-round draft pick in 1999; with a pick they received from the Redskins for quarterback Brad Johnson. He had been selected largely due to his extremely strong arm, which the team believed was perfectly suited for Moss&#x27;s deep routes. The decision proved correct. Culpepper was a rookie sensation, the Vikings started 7–0, and Moss was a leading MVP candidate. In that stretch was a Week 4 game against the Detroit Lions, where Moss had seven receptions for 168 receiving yards and three touchdowns in the 31–24 victory. For the second time in three seasons, Moss punished the Dallas Cowboys in Dallas on Thanksgiving Day, including a spectacular second half touchdown in which Moss caught the ball with his entire body out of bounds, aside from his toes. The play would be the feature shot in NFL commercials for years to come. In Week 16 against the Green Bay Packers, Moss had four receptions for 136 receiving yards and one touchdown in the 33–28 loss. Moss finished the season with a career-high 1,437 yards and league-leading 15 touchdown receptions. In doing so, he became the youngest and fastest player to ever catch over 3,000 yards and 45 touchdowns, earning him a third consecutive trip to the Pro Bowl, and second selection to the All Pro team. In the Divisional Round against the New Orleans Saints, Moss had two receptions for 121 receiving yards and two touchdowns in the 34–16 victory. In the NFC Championship, the Vikings were defeated 41–0 by the New York Giants. Moss was held to two receptions for 18 yards in the game

====2001 season====
In the offseason, Moss and his agent Danté DiTrapano began negotiating a new contract with the Minnesota Vikings. He was scheduled to earn $3.5 million in 2001. However, Moss, who was entering the final year of the rookie contract he signed in 1998, was seeking a long-term deal that would make him the highest-paid player in the NFL. His agent said, &quot;We want to break the tradition of quarterbacks being the highest-paid players.&quot; One option the Vikings had would be to apply the franchise tag after the season ended, but sources stated that Moss would request a trade if that happened because it would still be less than what he could command on the open market.

Just prior to the start of training camp in July, Vikings owner Red McCombs signed Moss to an 8-year, $75 million contract extension. The extension included a $10 million signing bonus and another $8 million in guarantees.

In Week 10, against the New York Giants, Moss had ten receptions for 171 receiving yards and three touchdowns in the 28–16 victory. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week. In Week 12 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he had eight receptions for 144 receiving yards and one touchdown in the 21–16 loss. In the following game against the Tennessee Titans, he had seven receptions for 158 receiving yards and a touchdown in the 42–24 victory. In the next game, against the Detroit Lions, he had seven receptions for 144 receiving yards and two touchdowns in the 27–24 loss. Despite finishing the season with 10 touchdowns and posting at least 1,000 receiving yards (1,233) for the fourth consecutive season, Moss failed to make the Pro Bowl for the first time in his career. The Vikings finished with a 5–11 record and missed the playoffs.

====2002 season====
After replacing Dennis Green on an interim basis to end the 2001 season, Mike Tice was officially named head coach on January 10, 2002. One of the strategies the Vikings&#x27; first-year head coach came up with was a formula to get Moss the ball more often. Coach Tice called it the Randy Ratio. It was an effort on the coaches part to throw 40% of the passes to Moss as a way to keep him involved in the offense more than he had been in the 2001 season when he had stretches in games where he was being shut out, and partly to use more game clock by sustaining long drives to give the Vikings defense a chance to rest. An assistant coach would stand on the sidelines during games and track how many times Moss had been thrown to, and then inform Tice of the percentages so that he is always aware of it. In the 2001 season, the Vikings record was 4–1 when Moss had 40% of the passes thrown his direction, and 1–10 in other games.

The strategy was a response to the &#x27;Randy Rules,&#x27; as Vikings receiver Chris Walsh called them. The Randy Rules, similar to the Jordan Rules, were a defensive strategy that teams employed when facing the Vikings to try and eliminate or reduce Randy&#x27;s impact on the game, and to prevent Moss from being matched up one-on-one with defenders because of his ability to burn them deep or outjump them in single coverage. Opposing teams would routinely double cover Moss with techniques such as having a cornerback attempt to jam him at the line of scrimmage, having a corner defend underneath with a safety defending against the deep ball, having a zone defense roll to Moss&#x27;s side of the field, and assigning &quot;spies&quot; to follow Moss everywhere he went.

Coach Tice discussed the strategy, explaining that Moss would be running more short and intermediate routes and fewer deep patterns. In training camp, Moss worked specifically on 12 new routes that he had rarely run in his first four NFL seasons, such as crossing patterns over the middle of the field and hook routes. Coach Tice said, &quot;When we say Randy Ratio, everybody in the league thinks, &#x27;OK, now they&#x27;re going to throw the ball down the field to Randy more and more and more.&#x27; That&#x27;s so far from the truth. In fact, we&#x27;ll probably throw the ball down the field to Randy this year even less.&quot;

The Randy Ratio did not last very long, as Tice scrapped the idea midway through the 2002 season. Randy Moss said &quot;I didn&#x27;t really care much about the Randy Ratio when it was brought up. I just wanted to win.&quot; In Week 15 against the New Orleans Saints, he had 11 receptions for 113 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in the 32–31 victory. In Week 16, Moss threw a touchdown pass to D&#x27;Wayne Bates in the 20–17 victory over the Miami Dolphins. Moss had seven games with least 100 receiving yards on the year. While Moss caught a career-high 106 passes, he also had a career-low seven touchdown receptions, and the Vikings struggled to a 6–10 record. Moss was named to his fourth Pro Bowl. Tice suggested after the season that it was a mistake to inform opponents about his offensive gameplan, but that it was a tool &quot;to motivate [Moss] and say he was the guy.&quot;

====2003 season====
Moss&#x27;s fortunes took a better turn on the football field during the 2003 regular season, where he became the second wide receiver in NFL history (behind Jerry Rice in 1995) to play more than 12 games (he played 16) while averaging over 100 yards and one touchdown per contest. In Week 1, against the Green Bay Packers, he had nine receptions for 150 receiving yards and a touchdown in the 30–25 victory. In Week 4, against the San Francisco 49ers, he had eight receptions for 172 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns in the 35–7 victory. In Week 7 against the Denver Broncos, he had ten receptions for 151 yards in the 28–20 victory. In the following game against the New York Giants, he had seven receptions for 125 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in the 29–17 loss. In Week 13, against the St. Louis Rams, he had ten receptions for 160 receiving yards and one touchdown in the 48–17 loss. In the following game against the Seattle Seahawks, he had eight receptions for 133 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in the 34–7 victory. In Week 16 against the Kansas City Chiefs, he had seven receptions for 111 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in the 45–20 victory. Overall, he finished with 111 receptions for 1,632 yards and 17 touchdowns. All three numbers either tied or became a new personal best for Moss. The Vikings finished the season 9–7 but missed the playoffs. One of Moss&#x27;s memorable highlights that year was when he lateraled to Moe Williams for a last-second touchdown during a home game against Denver. Moss was named to his fifth Pro Bowl.

In the offseason, he attended the Vikings strength and conditioning program and added five pounds of muscle to his frame.

====2004 season====
Moss started the season strong catching eight touchdowns in his first five games of the season, a 4–1 stretch for the Vikings. However, he sustained a hamstring injury to his right leg against the New Orleans Saints in Week 6 that hampered him for the next five weeks. He played in Week 7 against the Tennessee Titans, but had no receptions in a game for the first time in his career. He also played the following week against the New York Giants, but again recorded no receptions and was used mainly as a decoy. The injury eventually sidelined him for three straight weeks. He returned to the lineup in Week 12 with a touchdown catch against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He closed out the regular season with consecutive games going over the 100-yard mark with a touchdown in Weeks 14 and 15 against the Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions.

Even though he finished the season with 13 touchdowns in 13 games, he posted career lows in receptions (49) and receiving yards (767). 2004 was the first season in his career that he failed to reach the 1,000-yard mark.

On January 9, 2005, the Minnesota Vikings played division rival Green Bay Packers in an NFC Wild Card Round game. Moss finished the game with four catches for 70 yards and two touchdowns in the 31–17 win. After the second score, Moss trotted to the end zone goalpost and feigned pulling down his pants to moon the Green Bay fans. NFL on Fox announcer Joe Buck called it a &quot;disgusting act.&quot; Moss was fined $10,000 for his actions. Though the Vikings would win the game, they would lose in the next round of the playoffs to the Philadelphia Eagles, and Moss was traded at the end of the season.

===Oakland Raiders===

On March 2, 2005, Moss was traded to the Oakland Raiders for linebacker Napoleon Harris and the Raiders&#x27; first (7th overall, which Minnesota parlayed into wide receiver Troy Williamson) and seventh-round picks in the 2005 NFL Draft. Adding a player of Moss&#x27;s caliber generated optimism in Oakland. With fellow starter Jerry Porter wearing number 84, Moss changed his jersey number to 18, which had been his jersey number at Marshall and was initially not allowed for wide receivers when he entered the NFL in 1998, but had been made permissible in 2004 when a rule change allowed receivers to wear number 10–19 in addition to 80s numbers.

In his Raiders debut, Moss had five receptions for 130 yards and a touchdown in the 30–20 loss to the New England Patriots. In the following game, he had five receptions for 127 receiving yards and one touchdown in the 23–17 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Raiders&#x27; poor play was a theme throughout the season, while Moss suffered nagging injuries which limited his production. He surpassed the 1,000 mark on the final day of the 2005 season with seven receptions for 116 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns against the New York Giants. He finished the year with 1,005 receiving yards on 60 catches as the Raiders went 4–12.

In Week 7 of the 2006 season, Moss had seven receptions for 129 yards and one touchdown in the 22–9 victory over the Arizona Cardinals. Moss recorded 553 yards and three touchdowns on 42 receptions in 2006.

Moss was not happy in Oakland, and on November 14, 2006, when he was honored as a kick returner by having a college football award named after him, he responded to questions about his dropped passes and lackluster effort in several games. Moss said, &quot;Maybe because I&#x27;m unhappy and I&#x27;m not too much excited about what&#x27;s going on, so, my concentration and focus level tend to go down sometimes when I&#x27;m in a bad mood&quot;. Days later, he reiterated his unhappiness with losing games and being a member of the Raiders on his weekly segment with Fox Sports Radio, saying, &quot;I might want to look forward to moving somewhere else next year to have another start and really feel good about going out here and playing football&quot;.

===New England Patriots===

====2007 season====

There were rumors leading up to the 2007 NFL draft that the Raiders were eager to part ways with Moss through a trade. First-year Raiders head coach Lane Kiffin went so far as to contact their division rival Denver Broncos to &quot;gauge interest&quot;, but the Patriots and Green Bay Packers were the two teams most interested in acquiring Moss. Packers quarterback Brett Favre, who once said, &quot;There is no one in this league who puts fear in people more than Randy Moss,&quot; tried to persuade team management to trade for him, but a deal that both sides could agree to did not get done.

During the first day of the NFL Draft, the Patriots and Raiders discussed the trade several times before reaching an agreement. Bill Belichick spoke with Moss for the first time about the possibility of joining the Patriots at 2:30 Sunday morning. Moss boarded a plane and arrived in Boston later that morning on April 29 and was required to pass a team administered physical. Once he was cleared by Patriots officials, the teams completed a trade that sent Randy Moss to New England for a fourth-round selection in the 2007 NFL draft. The Patriots had acquired the draft pick the previous day from the San Francisco 49ers, and the Raiders selected John Bowie.

One of the conditions of the trade was that Randy Moss would have to restructure his contract for salary cap reasons. Just hours before the Moss trade was completed, New England quarterback Tom Brady converted $5.28 million of his 2007 base salary into a signing bonus that was spread out over the remaining portion of his contract so that it could free up cap room. This enabled the Patriots to absorb Moss&#x27;s incoming contract under the salary cap. Moss had two years remaining on his current deal and was scheduled to earn $9.75 million in 2007 and $11.25 million in 2008. Once the Patriots had Moss on their roster, he quickly agreed to a new one-year contract to replace his old one. The new deal gave him a $500,000 signing bonus, a base salary of $2.5 million, and the ability to earn an additional $1.75 million in incentives.

&quot;I&#x27;m still in awe that I&#x27;m a part of this organization,&quot; Moss said, clearly thrilled to join a team that could contend for the Super Bowl and to work with Coach Belichick. &quot;I think that he&#x27;s the kind of coach that can motivate me. He has a proven track record.&quot;

In the first week of training camp, during an 11-on-11 passing drill, Moss suffered a hamstring injury to his left leg. As a precaution, the injury prevented Moss from participating in any preseason games and he missed much of the rest of camp.

His first action in a Patriots uniform came against the New York Jets in Week 1. He quickly quieted critics who claimed that his skills had deteriorated by hauling in nine receptions for 181 yards, including a 51-yard touchdown reception in which he ran past three Jets defenders. He followed up the Jets game with three consecutive games, wins over the San Diego Chargers, Buffalo Bills, and Cincinnati Bengals, going over the 100-yard mark with two receiving touchdowns in each. In Week 7 against the Miami Dolphins, he had four receptions for 122 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in the 49–28 victory. In Week 9, against the Indianapolis Colts, he had nine receptions for 145 yards and a touchdown in the 24–20 victory. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against the Colts.

On November 4, 2007, James Black, NFL Editor for Yahoo! Sports wrote, &quot;Every week, in addition to out-leaping at least one defender for a touchdown, [Moss] keeps making incredible one-handed grabs that make you mutter, &#x27;How the heck did he come up with that? Two weeks later, he caught a career-high four touchdowns against the Buffalo Bills, all in the first half. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against the Bills. In Week 14, he had seven receptions for 135 receiving yards and two touchdowns in the 34–13 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers.

On December 29, the Patriots defeated the New York Giants 38–35, finishing their regular season with a perfect 16–0 record. Moss caught two touchdown passes for a total of 23, breaking the single-season record of 22 touchdown receptions previously set by Jerry Rice (in 12 games in the strike-shortened 1987 season). On the same play, Tom Brady broke Peyton Manning&#x27;s single-season record set in 2004 with his 50th touchdown pass. Moss recorded 98 catches for 1,493 yards in 2007, the highest yardage total in Patriots franchise history and the third-highest total number of catches, after teammate Wes Welker&#x27;s 112 catches that same season and Troy Brown&#x27;s 101 in 2001. He earned his sixth Pro Bowl selection and fourth first team All-Pro nomination. His 2007 season featured touchdowns in 13 of 16 games (including eight multi-touchdown games), nine 100-yard games, and six touchdown receptions of 40 or more yards. For the second-time in his NFL career, Moss was part of a team that broke the NFL single-season scoring record.

Despite his record-breaking 2007 season, Moss was relatively quiet in the playoffs, going two consecutive games without a touchdown for the first time all season. The Patriots defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Divisional Round and the San Diego Chargers in the AFC Championship. However, in Super Bowl XLII, against the New York Giants, he scored the go-ahead touchdown with 2:42 left in the fourth quarter on a six-yard pass from Tom Brady. The score was not enough for the heavily favored Patriots to end their only undefeated season with a Super Bowl win. Eli Manning drove the Giants down the field, connecting with Plaxico Burress for the game-winning touchdown and an upset over the Patriots. Two deep throws from Brady to Moss on 3rd &amp; 20 and 4th &amp; 20 on the Patriots final drive fell incomplete.

====2008 season====

On February 28, 2008, Moss became a free agent after the Patriots decided not to place the franchise tag on Moss. Although the Dallas Cowboys, Philadelphia Eagles, and Green Bay Packers were rumored to have interest in Moss, he decided to return to the Patriots, signing a three-year, $27 million deal on March 3, 2008. The contract included a $12 million signing bonus, and a total of $14.1 million guaranteed.

The first game of the 2008 season saw Brady suffer a torn ACL in his left knee while attempting a pass to Moss. The play occurred in the first half against the Kansas City Chiefs when safety Bernard Pollard dove at Brady&#x27;s leg while in his throwing motion. Moss described what he saw on the play by saying &quot;any time you see something like that, that looks foul, it looks dirty, it opens your eyes. So, me personally, it looked dirty.&quot; Matt Cassel replaced Brady for the rest of the season. In Week 12 against the Miami Dolphins, he had eight receptions for 125 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns in the 48–28 victory.

In 2008, Moss hauled in 69 catches for 1,008 yards and 11 touchdowns despite losing quarterback Tom Brady in the first game of the season.

====2009 season====
In the season opener of 2009, Moss caught a career-high 12 passes for 141 yards in a comeback 25–24 victory over the Buffalo Bills. In Week 5 against the Denver Broncos, Moss was placed deep in coverage on a Broncos Hail Mary attempt to end the first half, and intercepted Broncos quarterback Kyle Orton. In a snowy Week 6 game against the winless Tennessee Titans, Moss caught three touchdown passes from Tom Brady, two of them in the second quarter of the 59–0 victory as Brady set a record for most touchdown passes in a single quarter with five.

During the Patriots&#x27; bye week, Belichick stated that Moss &quot;is the smartest receiver he&#x27;s ever been around.&quot; He compared Moss&#x27;s ability to see the field and anticipate plays to that of Tom Brady, and to Lawrence Taylor, who Belichick coached with the New York Giants. He said Moss not only knows what he&#x27;s doing on a play, but what everybody else on the field is doing as well. &quot;That&#x27;s what makes them special. They just have a sixth, seventh sense&quot;, Belichick said. This sentiment was repeated when Moss was inducted into the Hall of Fame, as Belichick went further to say he learned from Moss.

In Week 9 against the Miami Dolphins, Moss recorded six catches for 147 yards and one touchdown in the 27–17 victory. The touchdown reception was the 140th of his career, which moved him into a tie for second place with Terrell Owens. 

The following week, in a prime time Sunday night matchup against the Indianapolis Colts, Moss had 179 yards and two touchdowns, including a 63-yard touchdown in the second quarter that moved him ahead of Terrell Owens for sole possession of second place in career touchdown receptions. In the 35–34 loss, he became just the 11th player in NFL history with 900+ receptions and the seventh player to reach 14,000+ career receiving yards.

In Week 16 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Moss had three receiving touchdowns in the 35–7 victory.

He finished the season with 83 receptions for 1,264 receiving yards and 13 receiving touchdowns. His 13 receiving touchdowns tied for the league lead. New England lost in the AFC Wild Card Round to the Baltimore Ravens 33–14. He was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame All-2000s first team.

====2010 season====
In the week leading up to the Patriots&#x27; 2010 season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals, Moss, who was entering the final year of his contract told CBS Sports that he &quot;did not feel wanted&quot; in New England absent a contract extension offer. Moss went on to catch five passes for 59 yards in Week 1. After the game, Moss told reporters that it would be his final season with the Patriots. The &quot;Boston Herald&quot; reported weeks later that Moss requested a trade following the game.

Moss had two receptions in Week 2 against the New York Jets, including a 34-yard touchdown that he caught one-handed after All-Pro cornerback Darrelle Revis pulled a hamstring. The following week against the Buffalo Bills, Moss had two more catches, both for touchdowns. His final game in New England came in Week 4 on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; against the Miami Dolphins; he did not record a catch in the game for the first time in his Patriots career as a touchdown pass attempt off a fake spike bounced off his hands in the end zone.
===Minnesota Vikings (second stint)===
Two days after the Patriots&#x27; game against Miami, Moss was traded to the Minnesota Vikings, in exchange for the Vikings&#x27; third-round selection (later used to select quarterback Ryan Mallett) in the 2011 NFL draft. The Patriots also sent a 2012 seventh-round selection to the Vikings as part of the trade.

On November 1, less than four weeks after being traded to Minnesota, Vikings head coach Brad Childress told Vikings players in a team meeting that Moss was going to be waived by the team, one day after he criticized Childress and teammates in a press conference following the Vikings&#x27; loss to the Patriots at Gillette Stadium. Just before the press conference, Moss reportedly told team owner Zygi Wilf that Childress was unfit to coach in the NFL and should be fired. Wilf reportedly considered firing Childress and keeping Moss, but Moss was officially waived the next day, November 2. Childress was eventually fired on November 22.

===Tennessee Titans===
Moss was claimed off waivers by the Tennessee Titans, the only team to submit a claim, on November 3, 2010. Moss played eight games with the Titans, starting four. He made six catches for 80 yards and no touchdowns.

Moss finished the 2010 season with career lows in receptions (28) and receiving yards (393). The Titans stated that they did not plan to re-sign Moss for the 2011 season, and he became a free agent.

===Initial retirement and comeback===
On August 1, 2011, Moss&#x27;s agent, Joel Segal, announced Moss&#x27;s decision to retire from professional football.

On February 13, 2012, his 35th birthday, Moss announced that he was coming out of retirement and was ready to play again.

===San Francisco 49ers===
On March 12, 2012, Moss signed a one-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers for undisclosed financial terms after a workout with the team&#x27;s head coach Jim Harbaugh. On September 9, 2012, Moss caught his 154th touchdown reception, and subsequently passed Terrell Owens for sole possession of second on the all-time receiving touchdown list. After Alex Smith suffered a concussion against the St. Louis Rams in week 10, Colin Kaepernick took over as the team&#x27;s quarterback, and Moss had at least two receptions in each of the remaining five games of the regular season. He finished the season with 28 catches for 434 yards and three touchdowns. Since the retirement of Terrell Owens at the end of 2010, he had been the NFL&#x27;s active leader in receiving yards. Moss eventually went on to play in Super Bowl XLVII, where he had two receptions for 41 yards in a 34–31 loss to the Baltimore Ravens.

===Charity===
Moss has participated in, founded, and financed many charitable endeavors since joining the NFL, particularly aimed at helping children. Many times when talking about his charity work, he has said he just looks forward to &quot;seeing smiles.&quot; He has donated clothing and food to needy families, given away free backpacks to Boston area school-children, and hosted autograph signings. He has also bussed children to amusement parks, NBA games, and even NFL games in which he has played.

On June 29, 2005, he hosted the Randy Moss Celebrity Charity Invitational Bass Tournament. The tournament was a one-day event that paired celebrities and corporate sponsors with pro fishermen to raise money for the Smile Network, which is a foundation that provides financial assistance to children with treatable mouth problems, such as cleft palate. The tournaments motto is &quot;fish for a smile.&quot;

In 2008, Moss formed the Links for Learning foundation, which was established to help children in his home state of West Virginia, and to build learning centers for the most needy student populations. In June, he and his former high school teammate Jason Williams hosted the foundations first annual charity golf tournament at the Sleepy Hollow Country Club in Hurricane, West Virginia. In March 2009, Moss&#x27;s foundation made a donation that enabled the Women and Children&#x27;s Hospital of Charleston, West Virginia to purchase a Starlight Children&#x27;s Foundation &#x27;Fun Center&#x27; for their patients. The &#x27;Fun Center&#x27; is a portable bedside entertainment system equipped with a TV, DVD player, and 22 Nintendo Wii games.

===Randy Moss Motorsports===

On April 29, 2008, Moss announced the formation of Randy Moss Motorsports, an auto racing team in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. In July 2008, Moss announced that he had bought a 50 percent share in Morgan-Dollar Motorsports, with the team&#x27;s No. 46 entry switching to No. 81. The team was reportedly shut down in 2012.

===Analyst career===
Upon his release from the 49ers, Moss was hired as an analyst for Fox Sports 1&#x27;s &quot;Fox Football Daily&quot; show. Moss was hired as an associate head coach and defensive coordinator at Victory Christian Center High School in Charlotte, North Carolina, in June 2014, where his son was attending high school and playing football.

In July 2016, Moss joined ESPN as an analyst, appearing on &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot; and &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot;. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018. In 2019, Moss was named to the National Football League 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.

==Personal life==
Moss&#x27;s parents are Maxine Moss and Randy Pratt. Moss has little contact with his father. He has a sister named Lutisia and had a brother Eric, who had a short stint in the NFL as an offensive tackle with the Minnesota Vikings. Moss has five children: Sydney, Senali, Thaddeus, and Montigo. Moss is a Christian, attested by his NFL Hall of Fame speech.

===Health===
In December 2024, Moss announced that he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot; to address an &quot;internal&quot; and unspecified health issue. He directed his message to men and urged them to get checkups and bloodwork done, without specifying any particular illness. On December 10, sportswriter Larry Fitzgerald Sr. publicly announced that Moss was battling liver cancer. This was refuted by Randy&#x27;s son Thaddeus. On December 13, Moss revealed that he had undergone a Whipple procedure to address bile duct cancer and that he was now &quot;a cancer survivor&quot;. On Thanksgiving, he had a stent inserted into his liver after experiencing discolored urine.

===Traffic incident===
On September 24, 2002, in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, Moss was driving and was preparing to make an illegal turn. A traffic control officer, noticing what he was about to do, stood in front of his vehicle and ordered him to stop. Eyewitness accounts of the event differ at this point, but Moss did not comply with the officer&#x27;s order, and she was bumped by his vehicle and fell to the ground. Moss was arrested, and a search of his vehicle revealed a joint amounting to less than a gram of marijuana in his ashtray. Initially charged with felony Suspicion of Assault with a Deadly Weapon and a misdemeanor marijuana possession, Moss spent the night in jail and was released the following morning. Moss pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor traffic violation and was ordered to pay a $1,200 fine and perform 40 hours of community service. While the criminal charges were thus disposed of, the civil lawsuit filed by the traffic control officer brought a substantial penalty fine &quot;in the low to mid six figures&quot;. Moss claimed that the joint was not his, and that he had let friends use his car prior to the accident.

===Marijuana use===
In April 1996, Moss smoked a joint just prior to turning himself in to jail. He was scheduled to finish the remainder of his 30-day sentence for misdemeanor battery while in high school. During his first week in jail, Moss was given a drug test that came back positive. He was placed in solitary confinement for a week and had 60 days attached to his 27-day sentence. Coach Bobby Bowden revoked his scholarship and Moss was dismissed from Florida State University for the failed drug test.

Moss tested positive in 2001 for marijuana under the NFL&#x27;s substance abuse program and was subject to additional random drug screening for two years. A first time violation of the NFL&#x27;s drug policy can result in up to 10 tests per month. Moss did not fail an NFL drug test again, and was rotated out of the program after two years.

In August 2005, during an interview with Bryant Gumbel, Moss admitted that he has smoked marijuana during his NFL career &quot;every blue moon.&quot; When asked whether he still used marijuana currently, Moss replied &quot;I might. I might have fun. And, you know, hopefully ... I won&#x27;t get into any trouble by the NFL by saying that, you know. I have had fun throughout my years and, you know, predominantly in the offseason.&quot; The interview drew criticism from the league office, and his agent tried to spin it that his words were taken out of context. In response, Moss said &quot;That was really me talking in the past tense of way back in the beginning of my career and my childhood – especially in high school and college.&quot;

===Dating violence allegations===
On January 15, 2008, Orlando-based radio station WDBO reported that Moss &quot;had&quot; been hit with a temporary injunction for protection against dating violence. According to the affidavit, Moss committed battery upon Rachelle Washington, causing serious injury, and then refused to allow her to seek medical attention. The affidavit out of Broward County reveals Moss cannot come within 500 feet of the victim and cannot use or possess firearms.
The next day, in a locker room press conference, Moss claimed the woman was simply looking for money &quot;over an accident.&quot; On March 3, 2008, Washington filed papers with the Broward County Circuit Court clerk&#x27;s office requesting that the restraining order be dissolved. No criminal charges were filed in the incident.

<text>3 Hits from Hell (stylized as 3 hits from HeLL) is the sixth release by American horror punk band Misfits. The 7&quot; EP was released in April 1981 via Plan 9 Records. While there was no actual insert, some of the first pressing included a Misfits Fiend Club ad.

All three songs were recorded on 2&quot; 16-track tape at Master Sound Productions in Franklin Square, New York, on August 7, 1980, with Bobby Steele on guitar for the main riff of &quot;London Dungeon&quot; and producer Robbie Alter playing the chords, while Jerry Only&#x27;s younger brother Doyle (Paul Caiafa) recorded guitar on the rest of the songs on September 5, 1980, following Bobby&#x27;s departure. It was during this session that Doyle officially joined the band as Bobby&#x27;s replacement.

While none of the other ten songs from this session were released until 1985, after the band had broken up, all 13 tracks were later remixed for the &quot;12 Hits from Hell&quot; release.

&quot;London Dungeon&quot; was written by Glenn Danzig about his experience while jailed in Brixton on December 2, 1979. Both &quot;Horror Hotel&quot; and &quot;Ghouls Night Out&quot; were based on horror films: &quot;Horror Hotel&quot; (a 1960 Christopher Lee vehicle) and the 1958 Ed Wood film &quot;Night of the Ghouls&quot;, respectively.

==Pressing history==
The pressing history and details of this three-song EP are the most confounding to record collectors of any Misfits&#x27; release. Since all of the known pressing records were incomplete or incorrect, it is impossible to know any more than a few facts mixed with much conjecture.

There were at least two, but possibly as many as five, distinct pressings. Estimates on the number and order of the various combinations of record attributes ranges from 3,000 to 7,000 black vinyl with a grey label and large spindle, which is known conclusively to be the earliest pressing, 2,000 to 7,000 black vinyl with a red label and large spindle, of which as many as 10 to 100 may actually be from an abbreviated earlier pressing, and 400 to 1,000 black vinyl with a red label and small spindle. The only fixed number is that there were 400 white vinyl copies with a red label and a large spindle, which was the final pressing. The total number of EPs pressed is estimated to be either 6,500 or 10,000, depending on which pressing information is to be believed.

<text>The Toliara Province (formerly Toliary or Tuléar) is a former province of Madagascar with an area of . It had a population of 2,229,550 (July, 2001). Its capital was Toliara. Near Toliara was the &quot;spiny forest&quot;. Toliara Province bordered the following provinces – Mahajanga Province in the north, Antananarivo Province in the northeast and Fianarantsoa Province in the east.

== Economy and population ==
Masikoro Malagasy and Tandroy Malagasy were the chief languages. Sea cucumbers were exported from the province and were an important factor in its economy. The deciduous Andronovory forest was located in the province.

The province was the poorest one in Madagascar. In 1993, 8 in every 10 person of the province was living below the poverty line. Despite the production of export crops the province recorded the highest rural poverty. The average fertility rate per woman was above 5. With 77 percent of its population being illiterate, Tolaira was the most illiterate province of Madagascar. Only 22 percent of the province&#x27;s population had received primary level education.

The commercially valuable softwood tree &quot;Givotia madagascariensis&quot;, found in Antananarivo and Toliara provinces was endemic to Madagascar. The oil producing plant &quot;moringa drouhardii&quot; was endemic to Toliara province. Deforestation was a major issue for the province. In April 1971, a peasant rebellion was organised by MONIMA leader Monja Joana. The peasants refused to pay taxes and the government retaliated by dissolving MONIMA and deporting Joana.

Toliara province offered poor transport and security facilities. Potable water was accessible to only 24.9% of the province&#x27;s households. It was rich in terms of minerals. Toliara province was in the news in July 2005 for its mining activity.

== Abolition ==

The provinces were abolished following the results of Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2007 which led to the formation of 22 smaller areas (&quot;faritra&quot; or regions) to facilitate regional development.

== Administrative divisions ==
Toliara Province was divided into four regions of Madagascar - Androy, Anosy, Atsimo Andrefana and Menabe. These four regions became the first-level administrative divisions when the provinces were abolished in 2009. They are sub-divided into 21 districts:
* Androy region:
** Ambovombe-Androy
** Bekily
** Beloha
** Tsiombe
* Anosy region:
** Amboasary Sud
** Betroka
** Taolanaro
* Atsimo-Andrefana region:
** Ampanihy Ouest
** Ankazoabo
** Benenitra
** Beroroha
** Betioky-Atsimo
** Morombe
** Sakaraha
** Toliara II
** Toliara
* Menabe region:
** Belon&#x27;i Tsiribihina
** Mahabo
** Manja
** Miandrivazo
** Morondava

<doc id="449274" wikidata="Q6690518" url="?curid=449274" title="Love Divine, All Loves Excelling">
<text>&quot;Love Divine, All Loves Excelling&quot; is a Christian hymn by Charles Wesley, first published in 1747. It was initially published as part of his &quot;Hymns for Those that Seek and Find&quot; and quickly became a central hymn in both Methodist and wider Christian worship. The hymn reflects Wesley&#x27;s teachings on Christian perfection, expressing a longing for God&#x27;s transforming and sanctifying grace. 

The hymn has been set to various tunes, with the enduring version being &quot;Hyfrydol&quot; by Welsh composer Rowland Prichard. It is sung in services, including royal weddings, across many denominations.

==Background==
It first appeared in Wesley&#x27;s &quot;Hymns for those that Seek, and those that Have Redemption&quot; (Bristol, 1747), apparently intended as a Christianization of the song &quot;Fairest Isle&quot; sung by Venus in Act 5 of John Dryden and Henry Purcell&#x27;s semi-opera &quot;King Arthur&quot; (1691), on which Wesley&#x27;s first stanza is modelled.

Wesley wrote:

::Love Divine, all Loves excelling,
::Joy of Heaven to Earth come down,
::Fix in us thy humble Dwelling,
::All thy faithful Mercies crown;

Dryden had written:

::Fairest Isle, all Isles Excelling,
::Seat of Pleasures, and of Loves;
::Venus here, will chuse her Dwelling,
::And forsake her Cyprian Groves.

In Dryden&#x27;s song, the goddess of love chooses the Isle of Britain over her native Cyprus; in Wesley&#x27;s hymn divine love itself is asked to choose the human heart as its residence over its native heaven.

The last lines of the hymn are likewise adapted from existing material. Wesley&#x27;s final lines,

::Till we cast our Crowns before Thee,
::Lost in Wonder, Love, and Praise!
evidently derive from (and improve on) Addison&#x27;s opening lines from his &quot;Hymn on Gratitude to the Deity&quot;

::When all thy mercies, O my God,
::My rising soul surveys;
::Transported with the view, I&#x27;m lost
::In wonder, love, and praise.

It has been suggested that Wesley&#x27;s words were written specifically for the tune by Purcell to which Dryden&#x27;s song had been set, and to which the hymn&#x27;s words themselves were later set (under the tune name &quot;Westminster&quot;) by John Wesley in his &quot;Sacred Melody,&quot; the &quot;annex&quot; to his &quot;Select Hymns with tunes annext&quot; (1761 et seq.).

Like many hymns, &quot;Love Divine&quot; is loosely trinitarian in organization: Christ is invoked in the first stanza as the expression of divine love; the Holy Spirit in the second stanza as the agent of sanctification; the Father in the third stanza as the source of life; and the Trinity (presumably) in the final stanza as the joint Creator of the New Creation. Like many hymns, too, this one is a tissue of biblical quotations, including &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot; (st. 2) as an epithet of Christ, from ; the casting of crowns before God&#x27;s throne (st. 4), from ; the promise that Christians shall be &quot;changed from glory into glory&quot; (st. 2 and 4), from ; as well as other, more general allusions.

==Textual history==

At its first appearance, the hymn was in four stanzas of eight lines (8.7.8.7.D), and this four-stanza version remains in common and current use to the present day, being taken up as early as 1760 in Anglican collections such as those by Madan (1760 and 1767), Conyers (1772), and Toplady (1776); in hymn books associated with
Whitefield (1767, 1800) and the Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s Connexion (1780, and 1800); and in Methodist hymn books slightly outside the mainstream (the &quot;Select Hymns&quot; of 1783; Spence&#x27;s &quot;Pocket Hymn Books&quot; of the early 19th century; and the American &quot;Wesleyan&quot; Methodist hymn books).

A second, abridged version (with the second stanza omitted), appeared as early as 1778 in &quot;Hymns and Psalms for the Service of Fitz-Roy Chapel&quot; (London, 1778), then in the Wesleyan &quot;Large Hymn Book&quot; of 1780, and thence in many others, chiefly British and predominantly Anglican, but including also many later official Methodist hymn books. A sample collation of 85 hymn books containing some version of this hymn suggests that the abridged version appears in roughly 25% of Protestant hymn books; the full four-stanza version in most of the remainder.

===Theologically-motivated alterations===
The omission of the second stanza is consistent with several other loci of textual variation in the hymn in this respect: the passages which are most subject to change tend for the most part to be those that 
advance a distinctively Wesleyan &quot;Perfectionist&quot; account of the Christian life—i.e. those that suggest that one can be completely cleansed of sin in this life, by means of a &quot;second blessing&quot; whereby committed and sanctified Christians rest wholly in God and may be said to share the holiness of Christ himself.

Many—certainly including those of a more Calvinist persuasion, and even perhaps Wesley&#x27;s brother John—found this idea troublesome. Even some fairly innocuous lines (&quot;Let us all thy Life receive,&quot; stanza 3) were probably read as suspiciously Perfectionist, hence the common alteration to &quot;Let us all thy &quot;Grace&quot; receive.&quot;

The same is probably true of other oft-changed lines. Most of the more enduring alterations occurred in one or another of the hymn books that together constituted the fledgling ecumenical
Evangelical hymnody that emerged in the decades around 1770, partly from the Calvinist wing of the Church of England, partly from Calvinistic Methodists and their circle; preeminently among them the collections of Martin Madan (1760 and many subsequent editions), his imitator Richard Conyers (1772); the more overtly Calvinistic Anglican Augustus Toplady; the hymn books of erstwhile Wesley ally, George Whitefield; and those associated with the Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s chapels (and their later incarnation as the Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s Connexion). Madan in particular is known for his influential hymn tinkering:

:Madan&#x27;s knack in reconstructing the work of other hands made his book a permanent influence both for good and evil. A number of familiar hymns still bear the marks of his editorial revision.

It was doubtless on theological grounds that the line &quot;Finish then thy New Creation&quot; (stanza 4) was often replaced by &quot;&quot;Carry on&quot; thy (or &#x27;the&#x27;) new creation,&quot; the latter suggesting an ongoing process of sanctification rather than its achievement; and &quot;Let us see thy great Salvation / Perfectly restor&#x27;d in Thee,&quot; frequently changed to &quot;...&quot;our whole&quot; salvation / &quot;secured by&quot; Thee&quot;), a formulation which also 
resolves some ambiguous referents. Wesley&#x27;s original probably meant (in crude paraphrase) &quot;let us experience the great salvation that you provide, so that we will be perfected by participation in you&quot;; 
unease with the ambiguity, and probably also with the theology, led to revised language that if less striking was felt to be clearer and more orthodox. Both of these changes were introduced by Augustus Toplady&#x27;s collection of 1776, followed by the Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s collections (e.g. that of 1780 and 1800).

&quot;Pure and sinless let us be&quot; (stanza 4) was toned down, or at least made less absolute, by alteration to &quot;Pure and &quot;holy,&quot;&quot; (Toplady 1776 again, followed again by the Countess of Huntingdon 1780 and 1800)
and similar substitutes, especially the very common &quot;Pure, &quot;unspotted&quot;&quot; (Madan, Conyers, and Whitefield) and &quot;Pure and &quot;spotless&quot;&quot; (John Wesley&#x27;s &quot;Select Hymns for ... all denominations&quot;, 5th ed. (1774) through 9th ed. (1783), followed by his &quot;Large Hymn Book&quot; (1780), and the Methodist &quot;Pocket Hymn Books.&quot;)

The second stanza, when it was not omitted altogether, offered, and continues to offer, two stumbling-blocks for theologically sensitive Christians: line 4 asks &quot;Let us find that Second Rest&quot;; and line 5, &quot;Take away our Power of sinning.&quot; The phrase &quot;Second Rest,&quot; to those for whom it was not simply obscure, would seem an explicit reference to Wesleyan &quot;Second Blessing&quot; theology; and the request to be stripped even of the ability to sin doubtless seemed to many unrealistic at best and blasphemous or immoral at worst, as appearing to &quot;be a prayer to take away our free moral agency.&quot;

 Upon the two doubtful lines in the centre of this stanza, that refined critic, Mr. Fletcher, of Madeley, has remarked:-- &#x27;Mr. Wesley says second rest, because an imperfect believer enjoys a first, inferior rest; if he did no, he would be no believer.&#x27; And of the line, &#x27;Take away the power of sinning,&#x27; he asks, &#x27;Is this expression not too strong? Would it not be better to soften it by saying, &quot;Take away the love of sinning?&quot; [or the bent of the mind towards sin.] Can God take away from us our power of sinning without taking away our power of free obedience?&#x27;

&quot;Second Rest&quot; is very generally replaced, usually by &quot;thy &quot;promised&quot; rest&quot;; or, later, by &quot;&quot;the promis&#x27;d rest&quot;; and &quot;the Power of Sinning&quot; by &quot;the &quot;love&quot; of sinning&quot; (probably introduced by Maddan 1767, followed by other representatives of 
the evangelical hymnody); or &quot;our &quot;bent&quot; of (or &#x27;to&#x27;) sinning&quot; (originally and still chiefly in Methodist collections).

In gist, editors (particularly Calvinists) were disposed to perceive Wesleyan doctrine (freewill Arminianism) lurking in the lyrics and to change them accordingly, thus eliciting John Wesley&#x27;s statement against changes which would make him and his brother accountable for &quot;the nonsense or the doggerel&quot; of others. Several rephrasings of &quot;Love Divine&quot; continue in circulation.

===Abridged versions===
Aside from the Wesleys&#x27; own abridgement, other abridged versions include one that combines the first half of the second stanza with the first half
of the third (omitting the remainder of each); another that omits the third stanza, as well as introducing some aesthetic changes that tend toward the bland; another that combines the first half of stanza 1 with the first half of stanza 2 into a single new stanza 1 and retains a modified version of stanza 4 as a new stanza 2; and yet another that omits the fourth.

Abbreviated Unitarian and Universalist versions of the
hymn are typical of those traditions
in the radical alterations they make, replacing most references to
Christ and all references to Trinitarian orthodoxy, as well as anything else they regarded as offensive to a 
universal and rational religion; typical too in that they therefore
replace &quot;Charles Wesley&quot; as the author in favor of &quot;anonymous.&quot; In one American Universalist
version from 1841 (and similarly in the Unitarian hymnal of 1872) the four-stanza Trinitarian hymn to Christ and his Spirit
is transformed into a two-stanza paean to God narrowly addressed as &quot;Father...almighty&quot;; 

in another, widely but mistakenly attributed to Yorkshire Baptist John Fawcett
under the title &quot;Praise to Thee, Thou Great Creator,&quot; &quot;Love Divine&quot; serves as a source for a cento, or
pastiche, combined with the
final stanza of Fawcett&#x27;s genuine hymn, &quot;Lo! the bright
and rosy morning&quot; (1782), this combination
appearing apparently for the first time in 
the Exeter Unitarian &quot;Collection of Psalms and Hymns for Social and Private Worship&quot; (1812).

::Father! Source of all compassion!
::Pure, unbounded grace is thine:
::Hail, the God of our salvation!
::Praise him for his love divine!

::Joyfully on earth adore him,
::Till in heaven our song we raise:
::There [var. Then] enraptur&#x27;d fall before him,
::Lost in wonder, love, and praise.

More recent times have in general been more respectful of Wesley&#x27;s
original, with the exception of those collections that by policy
eschew the second-person singular, replacing &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou&quot;
with &quot;you&quot; and sometimes introducing other changes in order
to maintain meter and rhyme.
Another exception is the two-stanza adaptation by Carroll Thomas Andrews (1969) that has
been reprinted in several Roman Catholic hymn books set to the tune &#x27;Hyfrydol.&#x27; Of the sixteen lines in Andrews&#x27; version, only 
three come directly from Wesley&#x27;s hymn, and another four or five perhaps owe something to the original, 
but the theme and force of the original are wholly lost.

==Popularity==
Judging by general repute, it is among Wesley&#x27;s finest: &quot;justly famous and beloved, better known than almost any other hymn of Charles Wesley.&quot; Judging by its distribution, it is also among his most successful: by the end of the 19th century, it is found in 15 of the 17 hymn books consulted by the authors of &quot;Lyric Studies.&quot; On a larger scale, it is found almost universally in general collections of the past century, including not only Methodist and Anglican hymn books and commercial and ecumenical collections, but also hymnals published by Reformed, Presbyterian, Baptist, Brethren, Seventh-day Adventist, Lutheran, Congregationalist, Pentecostal, and Roman Catholic traditions, among others including the Churches of Christ. Specifically, it appears in 1,328 of the North American hymnals indexed by the online &quot;Dictionary of North American Hymnology&quot;, comparable to Newton&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; (1,036), Wesley&#x27;s &quot;O for a Thousand Tongues&quot; (1,249), and Watts&#x27; &quot;When I Survey the Wondrous Cross&quot; (1,483), though still well short of Toplady&#x27;s &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; (2,139) or Wesley&#x27;s own &quot;Jesu, Lover of my Soul&quot; (2,164).

The hymn, initially sung by small Methodist societies, is now commonly performed at British state occasions, such as the wedding of Prince Charles and Diana and the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.

==Musical settings==

In current use, the hymn seems to be set most often, particularly in American hymnals, to the tune Beecher by John Zundel (1815–1882; from 
&quot;Christian Heart Songs,&quot; 1870); and to the stately Welsh tunes &quot;Hyfrydol&quot; by Rowland Hugh Prichard (1811–1887);
&quot;Blaenwern&quot; by William Penfro Rowlands (1860–1937); and &quot;Moriah&quot;—the latter two especially in Great Britain.
One of several tunes known, inevitably, as &quot;Love Divine,&quot; that by Sir John Stainer, appeared with the hymn first in the 1889 Supplement to &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot; and has persisted into several
modern British collections; Airedale, by Sir C. V. Stanford, appeared in the 1924 edition
of &quot;Hymns A &amp; M&quot; but seems confined there, as does Bithynia (by Samuel Webbe, 1740–1816; from Webbe&#x27;s &quot;Collection,&quot; 1792) in several Methodist collections. There has also been at least one modern attempt to revive the hymn&#x27;s original tune, &quot;Westminster.&quot;

<doc id="449278" wikidata="Q2367463" url="?curid=449278" title="Mohammedan">
<text>Mohammedan (also spelled &quot;Muhammadan&quot;, &quot;Mahommedan&quot;, &quot;Mahomedan&quot; or &quot;Mahometan&quot;) is a term for a follower of Muhammad, the Islamic prophet. It is used as both a noun and an adjective, meaning belonging or relating to, either Muhammad or the religion, doctrines, institutions and practices that he established. The word was formerly common in usage, but the terms &quot;Muslim&quot; and &quot;Islamic&quot; are more common today. Though sometimes used stylistically by some Muslims, a vast majority consider the term archaic or a misnomer, as it suggests that Muslims worship Muhammad himself and not God.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites 1663 as the first recorded usage of the English term; the older spelling &quot;Mahometan&quot; dates back to at least 1529. The English word is derived from Neo-Latin &quot;Mahometanus&quot;, from Medieval Latin &quot;Mahometus&quot;, Muhammad. It meant simply a follower of Mohammad.

In Western Europe, down to the 13th century or so, some Christians had the belief that Muhammad had either been a heretical Christian or that he was a god worshipped by Muslims. Some works of Medieval European literature referred to Muslims as &quot;pagans&quot; or by sobriquets such as the &quot;paynim foe&quot; (enemy). Depictions, such as those in the &quot;Song of Roland&quot;, show Muslims praying to a variety of &quot;idols&quot;, including Apollyon, Lucifer, Termagant, and Mahound. During the Trials of the Knights Templar (1300–1310s), reference was often made to their worship of the demon Baphomet; this is similar to &quot;Mahomet&quot;, the Latin transliteration of Muhammad&#x27;s name, and Latin was, for another 500 years, the language of scholarship and erudition for most of Europe.

These and other variations on the theme were all set in the &quot;temper of the times&quot; of the Muslim–Christian conflict, as Medieval Europe was becoming aware of its great enemy in the wake of the quickfire success of the Muslims through a series of conquests shortly after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, as well as the lack of real information in the West of the mysterious East.

==Obsolescence==
The term has been largely superseded by &quot;Muslim&quot; (formerly transliterated as &quot;Moslem&quot;) or &quot;Islamic&quot;. &quot;Mohammedan&quot; was commonly used in European literature until at least the mid-1960s. &quot;Muslim&quot; is more commonly used today, and the term &quot;Mohammedan&quot; is widely considered archaic or in some cases even offensive.

The term remains in limited use. The Government Muhammadan Anglo Oriental College in Lahore, Pakistan retains its original name, while the similarly named &quot;Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College&quot; in Aligarh, India was renamed Aligarh Muslim University in 1920. There are also a number of sporting clubs in Bangladesh and India which include the word, such as Mohammedan Sporting Club (Dhaka), Mohammedan Sporting Club (Chittagong), Mohammedan Sporting Club (Jhenaidah) and Mohammedan S.C. (Kolkata).

==Muslim objections to the term==
Some modern Muslims have objected to the term, saying that the term was not used by Muhammad himself or his early followers, and that the religion teaches the worship of God alone (see &quot;shirk&quot; and &quot;tawhid&quot;) and not Muhammad or any other of God&#x27;s prophets. Thus modern Muslims believe &quot;Mohammedan&quot; is a misnomer, &quot;which seem[s] to them to carry the implication of worship of Mohammed, as Christian and Christianity imply the worship of Christ.&quot; Also, the term &quot;al-Muḥammadīya&quot; (the Arabic equivalent of Mohammedan) has been used in Islam to denote several sects considered heretical.

==Usage by Muslims==

Islam has, and has had, many schools and branches. &quot;Tariqa Muhammadiyya&quot; (&quot;the Way of Mohammad&quot;) is a school of reform Sufism that arose in the 18th century and seeks to redirect and harmonize Sufi philosophy and practices with the authority and example of the prophet and hadith.

In Indonesia, &quot;Muhammadiyah&quot; (&quot;followers of Muhammad&quot;) is the name of a Sunni socioreligious reform movement that shuns syncretistic and Sufi practices and advocates a return to a purer form of Islam based on the hadith and examples from the life of the prophet. It has adapted institutions such as the Boy Scouts to Islamic ends as the Gerakan Pramuka Indonesia.

<text>The butterflyfish are a group of conspicuous tropical marine fish of the family Chaetodontidae; the bannerfish and coralfish are also included in this group. The approximately 129 species in 12 genera are found mostly on the reefs of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. A number of species pairs occur in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, members of the huge genus &quot;Chaetodon&quot;.

Butterflyfish look like smaller versions of angelfish (Pomacanthidae), but unlike these, lack preopercle spines at the gill covers. Some members of the genus &quot;Heniochus&quot; resemble the Moorish idol (&quot;Zanclus cornutus&quot;) of the monotypic Zanclidae. Among the paraphyletic Perciformes, the former are probably not too distantly related to butterflyfish, whereas the Zanclidae seem far less close.

==Description and ecology==

Butterflyfish mostly range from in length. The largest species, the lined butterflyfish and the saddle butterflyfish, &quot;C. ephippium&quot;, grow to . The common name references the brightly coloured and strikingly patterned bodies of many species, bearing shades of black, white, blue, red, orange, and yellow. Other species are dull in colour. Butterflyfish are a boundless, different group of marine percoids with delegates on practically all coral reef frameworks and in every single tropical ocean. Their bright and color patterns have drawn in much consideration, creating an abundance of data about their conduct and environment. Many have eyespots on their flanks and dark bands across their eyes, not unlike the patterns seen on butterfly wings. Their deep, laterally narrow bodies are easily noticed through the profusion of reef life. The conspicuous coloration of butterflyfish may be intended for interspecies communication. Butterflyfish have uninterrupted dorsal fins with tail fins that may be rounded or truncated, but are never forked.

Generally diurnal and frequenting waters less than deep (though some species descend to , butterflyfish stick to particular home ranges. These corallivores are especially territorial, forming pairs and staking claim to a specific coral head. Contrastingly, the zooplankton feeders form large conspecific groups. By night, butterflyfish hide in reef crevices and exhibit markedly different coloration.

Their coloration also makes them popular aquarium fish. However, most species feed on coral polyps and sea anemones. Balancing the relative populations of prey and predator is complex, leading hobby aquarists to focus on the few generalists and specialist zooplankton feeders.

Butterflyfish are pelagic spawners; that is, they release many buoyant eggs into the water, which become part of the plankton, floating with the currents until hatching. The fry go through a tholichthys stage, wherein the body of the postlarval fish is covered in large, bony plates extending from the head. They lose their bony plates as they mature. Only one other family of fish, the scats (Scatophagidae) express such an armored stage.

==Taxonomy, systematics and evolution==
The Chaetodontidae can be, but are not usually, divided into two lineages that arguably are subfamilies. The subfamily name Chaetodontinae is a little-used leftover from the period when the Pomacanthidae and Chaetodontidae were united under the latter name as a single family. Hence, Chaetodontinae is today considered a junior synonym of Chaetodontidae. In any case, one lineage of Chaetodontidae (in the modern sense) contains the &quot;typical&quot; butterflyfish around &quot;Chaetodon&quot;, while the other unites the bannerfish and coralfish genera. As the Perciformes are highly paraphyletic, the precise relationships of the Chaetodontidae as a whole are badly resolved.

Chaetodontidae is classified within the suborder Percoidei by the 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot;, but they are placed in an unnamed clade which sits outside the superfamily Percoidea. This clade contains 7 families which appear to have some relationship to Acanthuroidei, Monodactylidae, and Priacanthidae. Other authorities have paced the family in the order Chaetodontiformes alongside the family Leiognathidae. Presently, based on the most recent phylogenetic analyses, Eschmeyer&#x27;s Catalog of Fishes places it in the large, diverse order Acanthuriformes. Molecular analyses suggest that the Chaetodontidae shared a common ancestor with the Scatophagidae and Pomacanthidae that lived during the Early Eocene (54 Ma).

Before DNA sequencing, the taxonomy was confused about whether to treat these as species or subspecies. Also, numerous subgenera have been proposed for splitting out of &quot;Chaetodon&quot;, and it is becoming clear how to subdivide the genus if that is desired.

=== Fossil record ===
The fossil record of this group is disputed and marginal. Their restriction to coral reefs means their carcasses are liable to be dispersed by scavengers, overgrown by corals, and any that do fossilize will not long survive erosion. Many Eocene-aged fish such as &quot;Pygaeus&quot; have been variously referred to Chaetodontidae in the past; if used for calibration, it can be deduced that most living genera were probably distinct by the end of the Paleogene 23 Mya. However, these Eocene genera cannot be reliably referred to Chaetodontidae.

The earliest confirmed fossil specimens of Chaetodontidae are an indeterminate larval specimen from Frauenweiler, Germany, two tholichthys specimens from the Menilite Formation of Poland, as well as the extinct species &quot;Chaetodon (Blumchaetodon) wattsi&quot; from Italy; all date to the Early Oligocene. The occurrence of the first confirmed butterflyfish in the Early Oligocene is supported by molecular phylogenies indicating that the family may have arose during the Late Eocene.

===Genera===
The bannerfish-coralfish lineage can be further divided in two groups; these might be considered tribes, but have not been formally named. Genera are listed in order of the presumed phylogeny, from the most ancient to the youngest:

Bannerfish/coralfish lineage 1:
* &quot;Amphichaetodon&quot; 
* &quot;Coradion&quot; 
* &quot;Chelmon&quot; 
* &quot;Chelmonops&quot; 

Bannerfish/coralfish lineage 2:
* &quot;Forcipiger&quot; 
* &quot;Hemitaurichthys&quot; 
* &quot;Heniochus&quot; 
* &quot;Johnrandallia&quot; 

The &quot;typical&quot; butterflyfishes may eventually come to contain more genera; see &quot;Chaetodon&quot;:
* &quot;Chaetodon&quot; 
* &quot;Parachaetodon&quot; 
* &quot;Prognathodes&quot; 
* &quot;Roa&quot;

<doc id="449304" wikidata="Q855575" url="?curid=449304" title="A Mighty Fortress Is Our God">
<text>&quot;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God&quot; (originally written in German with the title &quot;&quot;) is one of the best known hymns by the Protestant Reformer Martin Luther, a prolific hymnwriter. Luther wrote the words and composed the hymn tune between 1527 and 1529. It has been translated into English at least seventy times and also into many other languages. The words are mostly original, although the first line paraphrases that of Psalm 46.

== History ==
&quot;A Mighty Fortress&quot; is one of the best known hymns of the Lutheran tradition, and among Protestants more generally. It has been called the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Reformation&quot; for the effect it had in increasing the support for the Reformers&#x27; cause. John Julian records four theories of its origin:

* Heinrich Heine: &quot;Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott&quot; was sung by Luther and his companions as they entered Worms on 16 April 1521 for the Diet;
* K. F. T. Schneider: it was a tribute to Luther&#x27;s friend Leonhard Kaiser, who was executed on 16 August 1527;
* Jean-Henri Merle d&#x27;Aubigné: it was sung by the German Lutheran princes as they entered Augsburg for the Diet in 1530, at which the Augsburg Confession was presented; and
* Some scholars believe that Luther composed it in connection with the Diet of Speyer (1529), at which the German Lutheran princes lodged their protest to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who wanted to enforce his 1521 Edict of Worms.

Alternatively, John M. Merriman writes that the hymn &quot;began as a martial song to inspire soldiers against the Ottoman forces&quot; during the Ottoman wars in Europe.

The earliest extant hymnal in which it appears is that of Andrew Rauscher (1531). It is believed to have been included in Joseph Klug&#x27;s Wittenberg hymnal of 1529, of which no copy remains. Its title was . Before that it is believed to have appeared in Hans Weiss Wittenberg&#x27;s hymnal of 1528, also lost. This evidence supports Luther having written it between 1527 and 1529, because Luther&#x27;s hymns were printed shortly after he wrote them.

==Tune==
Luther composed the melody, named from the text&#x27;s first line, in meter 87.87.55.56.7 (Zahn No. 7377a). This is sometimes denoted &quot;rhythmic tune&quot; to distinguish it from the later isometric variant, in 87.87.66.66.7-meter (Zahn No. 7377d), which is more widely known and used in Christendom. In 1906 Edouard Rœhrich wrote, &quot;The authentic form of this melody differs very much from that which one sings in most Protestant churches and figures in (Giacomo Meyerbeer&#x27;s) &quot;The Huguenots&quot;. ... The original melody is , by the way it bends to all the nuances of the text ...&quot;

While 19th-century musicologists disputed Luther&#x27;s authorship of the music to the hymn, that opinion has been modified by more recent research; it is now the consensus view of musical scholars that Luther did indeed compose the famous tune to go with the words.

== Reception ==
Heinrich Heine wrote in his 1834 essay , a history of emancipation in Germany beginning with the Reformation, that was the Marseillaise of the Reformation. This &quot;imagery of battle&quot; is also present in some translations, such as that of Thomas Carlyle (which begins &quot;A safe stronghold our God is still&quot;). In Germany, &quot;Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott&quot; was historically also used as a patriotic paean, which is why it was regularly sung at nationalistic events such as the Wartburg Festival in 1817. This patriotic undertone of the hymn emanates from its importance for the Reformation in general, which was regarded by the Protestants not only as a religious but as a national movement delivering Germany from Roman oppression. Furthermore, the last line of the fourth stanza of the German text, &quot;Das Reich muss uns doch bleiben&quot;, which is generally translated into English as &quot;The Kingdom&#x27;s ours forever&quot;, referring to the Kingdom of God, may also be interpreted as meaning the Holy Roman Empire must remain with the Germans.

The song is reported to have been used as a battle anthem during the Thirty Years War by forces under King Gustavus Adolphus, Lutheran king of Sweden. This idea was exploited by some 19th-century poets, such as Karl Curths, although there exists no primary source which supports this. The hymn had been translated into Swedish already in 1536, presumably by Olaus Petri, with the incipit, &quot;Vår Gud är oss en väldig borg&quot;. In the late 19th century the song also became an anthem of the early Swedish socialist movement.

In addition to being consistently popular throughout Western Christendom in Protestant hymnbooks, it is now a suggested hymn for Catholic Masses in the U.S., and appears in the &quot;Catholic Book of Worship&quot; published by the Canadian Catholic Conference in 1972. The eventful history and reception of &quot;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God&quot; has been presented interactively in Lutherhaus Eisenach&#x27;s revamped permanent exhibition since 2022.

=== English translations ===
The first English translation was by Myles Coverdale in 1539 with the title, &quot;Oure God is a defence and towre&quot;. The first English translation in &quot;common usage&quot; was &quot;God is our Refuge in Distress, Our strong Defence&quot; in J.C. Jacobi&#x27;s &quot;Psal. Ger.&quot;, 1722, p. 83.

An English version less literal in translation but more popular among Protestant denominations outside Lutheranism is &quot;A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing&quot;, translated by Frederick H. Hedge in 1853. Another popular English translation is by Thomas Carlyle and begins &quot;A safe stronghold our God is still&quot;.

Most North American Lutheran churches have not historically used either the Hedge or Carlyle translations. Traditionally, the most commonly used translation in Lutheran congregations is a composite translation from the 1868 &quot;Pennsylvania Lutheran Church Book&quot; (&quot;A mighty fortress is our God, a trusty shield and weapon&quot;). In more recent years a new translation completed for the 1978 &quot;Lutheran Book of Worship&quot; (&quot;A mighty fortress is our God, a sword and shield victorious&quot;) has also gained significant popularity.

=== Compositions based on the hymn ===

The hymn has been used by numerous composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach. There is a version for organ, BWV 720, written early in his career, possibly for the organ at Divi Blasii, Mühlhausen.
He used the hymn as the basis of his chorale cantata &quot;Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott&quot;, BWV 80 written for a celebration of Reformation Day. Bach also set the tune twice in his &quot;Choralgesänge&quot; (&quot;Choral Hymns&quot;), BWV 302 and BWV 303 (for four voices). Two orchestrations of Bach&#x27;s settings were made by conductors Leopold Stokowski and Walter Damrosch. Dieterich Buxtehude also wrote an organ chorale setting (BuxWV 184), as did Johann Pachelbel. George Frideric Handel used fragments of the melody in his oratorio &quot;Solomon&quot;. Georg Philipp Telemann also made a choral arrangement of this hymn and prominently used an extract of the verses beginning &quot;Mit unsrer Macht ist nichts getan&quot; in his famous &quot;Donnerode&quot;.

Felix Mendelssohn used it as the theme for the fourth and final movement of his Symphony No. 5, Op. 107 (1830), which he named &quot;Reformation&quot; in honor of the Reformation started by Luther; Joachim Raff wrote an Overture (for orchestra), &quot;Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott&quot;, Op. 127; Carl Reinecke quoted the hymn in his &quot;Zur Reformationsfeier&quot; Overture Op. 191; Giacomo Meyerbeer quoted it in his five-act grand opera &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; (1836); Charles-Valentin Alkan wrote an impromptu on this theme for pedal piano (in E♭ major Op. 69, 1866); 
and Richard Wagner used it as a &quot;motive&quot; in his &quot;Kaisermarsch&quot; (&quot;Emperor&#x27;s March&quot;), which was composed to commemorate the return of Kaiser Wilhelm I from the Franco-Prussian War in 1871. Two organ settings were written by Max Reger: his chorale fantasia &quot;Ein&#x27; feste Burg ist unser Gott&quot;, Op. 27, and a much shorter chorale prelude as No. 6 of his 52 Chorale Preludes, Op. 67, in 1902. Claude Debussy quoted the theme in his suite for piano duet, &quot;En blanc et noir&quot;. Alexander Glazunov quoted the melody in his &quot;Finnish Fantasy&quot;, Op. 88.

Ralph Vaughan Williams used the tune in his score for the film &quot;49th Parallel&quot;, most obviously when the German U-boat surfaces in Hudson Bay shortly after the beginning of the film. Flor Peeters wrote an organ chorale setting &quot;Ein feste Burg&quot; as part of his Ten Chorale Preludes, Op. 69, published in 1949. More recently it has been used by band composers to great effect in pieces such as &quot;Psalm 46&quot; by John Zdechlik and &quot;The Holy War&quot; by Ray Steadman-Allen. The hymn also features in &quot;Luther&quot;, an opera by Kari Tikka that premiered in 2000. It has also been used by African-American composer Julius Eastman in his 1979 work &quot;Gay Guerrilla&quot;, composed for an undefined number of instruments and familiar in its recorded version for 4 pianos. Eastman&#x27;s use of the hymn can arguably be seen as simultaneously a claim for inclusion in the tradition of &quot;classical&quot; composition, as well as a subversion of that very same tradition.

Mauricio Kagel quoted the hymn, paraphrased as &quot;Ein feste Burg ist unser Bach&quot;, in his oratorio &quot;Sankt-Bach-Passion&quot;, which tells Bach&#x27;s life and was composed for the tricentenary of Bach&#x27;s birth in 1985. Nancy Raabe composed a concertato on the hymn using organ, assembly, trumpet, and tambourine, the only such composition by a female composer.

<text>Convergence and Union (, CiU; ) was a Catalan nationalist electoral alliance in Catalonia, Spain. It was a federation of two constituent parties, the larger Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC) and its smaller counterpart, the Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC). It was dissolved on 18 June 2015.

CiU was a Catalan nationalist coalition. During its lifespan, it was usually seen as a moderate nationalist party in Spain, although a significant part of its membership had shifted to open Catalan independentism during the party&#x27;s last years, and by 2014 demonstrated its intention to hold a referendum on Catalan independence. There is some debate as to whether the coalition was conservative or centrist. Liberal tendencies dominate the larger CDC, while the smaller UDC is a Christian democratic party. As for its position in the nationalist debate, it was deliberately ambiguous so as to appeal to the broadest spectrum possible, from voters who seek full independence from Spain to those who are generally satisfied with the present self-government status. In general, the CDC tends to be more supportive of Catalan sovereignty, while the UDC is considered closer to traditional Catalan autonomism and more nuanced nationalism. The electoral manifesto for the elections in 2012 states that &quot;we want to build a wide social majority so that Catalonia can have its own State in the European frame, because Catalonia has the will to become a normal country among world&#x27;s countries and nations&quot;.

In the 2012 regional elections, CiU won 30.71% of the vote. It lost 12 seats in the Catalan Parliament, bringing them to a total of 50 deputies. While they have more than twice as many deputies as any other party, they were left 18 seats short of a majority in the 135-member body. After the election, they entered into coalition with the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), which has a completely different political orientation but also supports Catalan independence. &quot;El Periódico de Catalunya&quot; reported in August 2013 that the coalition may break apart due to fractions within the union about Catalan independence, with UDC opposing secessionism.

On 18 June 2015 CDC spokespersons declared the CiU federation &quot;finished&quot;, albeit amenable to an &quot;amicable&quot; separation. This occurred after an ultimatum had been issued by President Mas to UDC, due to their diverging positions on the Catalan independence process.

== Policies and ideology ==
CiU used to defend the notion of Catalonia as a nation within Spain, striving for the highest possible level of autonomy for Catalonia. However, it has recently become a pro-secession party.

CiU is generally considered a Catalan nationalist party; this is also the term it uses to describe itself. Both the Spanish and Catalan media perceive it as a moderate nationalist force. However, its liberal fraction (CDC) has a relatively strong current which advocates Catalan independence from Spain and which has grown stronger after 2006. Many high ranking exponents of the Democratic Convergence define CiU as an independentist political force. The party&#x27;s president Artur Mas has stated he would vote in favour of Catalan independence in a theoretical referendum of independence, but he added this would not be his official policy if elected as President of Catalonia.

On the other hand, the Christian democratic part of the coalition, the Democratic Union of Catalonia, is less favourable to the idea of an independent Catalonia. Nevertheless, several prominent members of the Democratic Union have also supported independence, especially since the late 2000s. However, the supporters of independence within the Democratic Union are a minority with much less influence than their counterparts in the Democratic Convergence.

==Terms of office==

At the Catalan level, CiU ruled the autonomous Catalan government during the 1980s until 2003 for 23 consecutive years led by Jordi Pujol (CDC). Pujol was succeeded in the party leadership by Artur Mas (CDC), while Unió&#x27;s leader (second at the CiU level) is Josep Antoni Duran i Lleida. It then served in opposition to a tripartite centre-left government of the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (PSC), the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and the Initiative for Catalonia Greens (ICV) until November 2010, when it regained power (but lacking an overall majority, still needing a coalition partner).

==2008 General Elections==
The party won 10 seats in the Congress of Deputies at the March 2008 elections.

CiU supported changes to the Catalan Statute of Autonomy to further increase Catalonia&#x27;s autonomy. It is currently the most voted party at regional elections in Catalonia, but in 2003 lost its absolute majority and is the main opposition party at the Catalan autonomous level, having been replaced in the government by a centre-left tripartite coalition formed in 2003 and re-formed after the 2006 Catalan regional elections, which were called due to divisions in the coalition.

==2010 Catalan elections==
On Sunday 28 November 2010 (28-N), CiU regained control of the regional parliament after seven years in opposition, winning about 38% of the popular vote, earning 62 seats out of the total 135. Its platform was broadly centrist, and somewhat ambiguous about independence from Spain.

In the 2010 elections, the turnout was just above 60%, and the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia were considered the biggest losers, holding only 28 seats of their former 37. All other parties lost support, as well, except the liberal-conservative People&#x27;s Party of Catalonia, which increased its support by 1.5%, and the liberal Citizens&#x27; Party which maintained their position.

==2012 Catalan elections==

On Sunday 25 November 2012, CiU maintained its control of the regional parliament by winning approximately 30 per cent of the popular vote and earning 50 seats of the total 135. This represents a drop in voter support since the 2010 election, with voter turn-out for the 2012 election at approximately 70%, or the highest since 1998. It is also the lowest percentage of the vote the coalition has scored since its formation in 1988.

<text>Suraiya Jamal Sheikh (15 June 1929 – 31 January 2004), mononymously known as Suraiya, was an Indian actress and playback singer who worked in Hindi films. In a career spanning from 1936 to 1964, Suraiya acted in over 70 films and sang 338 songs. Regarded among the finest and greatest actresses in the history of Indian cinema, she was known for her strong on-screen portrayals in a variety of genres. Suraiya was the most celebrated actress between the mid- to late 1940s and early 1950s and was paid more than her male counterparts.

Born in Lahore, Suraiya relocated to Bombay (now Mumbai) with her family when she was 1 year old. Apart from being a great actress, Suraiya was also a renowned playback singer, who mostly sang for herself. She sang her first song for &quot;Nai Duniya&quot; (1942), when she was only 12 years old. Suraiya made her first appearance as a child artist with the film &quot;Madame Fashion&quot; (1936), directed by Jaddanbai. She made her acting debut in 1941, with &quot;Taj Mahal&quot; in which she played the role of Mumtaz Mahal. Suraiya went onto establish herself as one of the leading actresses in Hindi cinema with films such as &quot;Ishaara&quot; (1943), &quot;Tadbir&quot; (1943), &quot;Phool&quot; (1945), &quot;Anmol Ghadi&quot; (1946), &quot;Omar Khaiyyam&quot; (1946), &quot;Parwana&quot; (1947), &quot;Dard&quot; (1947), &quot;Shair&quot; (1949), &quot;Dastan&quot; (1950), (1950), &quot;Diwana&quot; (1952), &quot;Bilwamangal&quot; (1954) and &quot;Mr. Lambu&quot; (1956).

Suraiya&#x27;s career marked a significant turning point in 1948–1949 with the highest grossing releases of the year—&quot;Vidya&quot; (1948), &quot;Pyar Ki Jeet&quot; (1948), &quot;Dillagi&quot; (1949) and &quot;Badi Behen&quot; (1949), that brought her public recognition. Her most notable portrayal was of a tawaif, Moti Begum in &quot;Mirza Ghalib&quot; (1954), which earned her critical acclaim and praises from two Prime Ministers of India. In her heyday, Suraiya was known as &quot;Malika-e-Husn&quot; (queen of beauty) and &quot;Malika-e-Adakari&quot; (queen of acting). 

Suraiya&#x27;s final film release was &quot;Rustam Sohrab&quot; (1963), after which she took retirement due to poor health. Suraiya received the Screen Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996, for her contribution to Indian cinema. She died on 31 January 2004, after suffering from various ailments, including hypoglycemia, ischaemia and insulinoma.

==Early life==
Suraiya was born as Suraiya Jamal Sheikh on 15 June 1929 in Lahore, British India (now Pakistan), to Aziz Jamal Sheikh and Mumtaz Sheikh in a Punjabi Muslim family. She was one year old, when her family moved to Mumbai (then called Bombay) to reside in Krishna Mahal at Marine Drive. Soon they were joined by her maternal uncle, M. Zahoor, who became a well known villain in the 1930s Bombay film industry and her maternal grandmother, Badshah Begum.

Suraiya belonged to a deeply religious Muslim family. She attended New High School, now known as J.B. Petit High School for Girls, in the Fort district of Bombay. At home, her grandmother gave her religious teachings in Persian. Suraiya&#x27;s childhood friends included Raj Kapoor and Madan Mohan, with whom she used to sing in children&#x27;s radio programmes at All India Radio. Suraiya did not have any professional training in music.

Born in an orthodox family, Suraiya was deeply religious and practiced Islam since her childhood. Suraiya was fond of literature, especially Urdu literature and use to read a lot of them.

==Acting career==
===Child artist and early work (1936–1943)===
Suraiya made her debut as a child actor in Jaddan Bai&#x27;s &quot;Madame Fashion&quot; in 1936 as Miss Suraiya. Later, she got a prominent role with the help of her uncle, M. Zahoor. During a holiday from school in 1941, she accompanied him to Bombay&#x27;s Mohan Studios to see the shooting of the film &quot;Taj Mahal&quot;, which was being directed by Nanubhai Vakil. Vakil noticed the charm and innocence of young Suraiya and selected her to play the role of Mumtaz Mahal, the film released in 1942 and marked her acting debut.

While she was singing for children&#x27;s programs for All India Radio (AIR) in Bombay, as a six-year old, Raj Kapoor and Madan Mohan were her co-artists. In fact, they first introduced her to AIR. Both were associated with her later as an adult, as her hero and as her music director respectively in films. At AIR, Zulfiqar Ali Bukhari was at that time the station director at the Bombay radio station. As soon as music director Naushad Ali heard Suraiya&#x27;s voice, he chose her to sing (at age 13) for Mehtab in Abdul Rashid Kardar&#x27;s film &quot;Sharda&quot; (1942). He became Suraiya&#x27;s mentor and she sang some of the best songs of her career under his baton. Later, he gave a string of hit songs when Suraiya became a full-fledged singing star in &quot;Anmol Ghadi&quot; (1946), &quot;Dard&quot; (1947), &quot;Dillagi&quot; (1949) and &quot;Dastaan&quot; (1950). As a child artist, Suraiya acted and also sang in the films, &quot;Usne Kya Socha&quot; (1937), &quot;Mother India&quot; (1938), &quot;Tamanna&quot; (1942), and &quot;Station Master&quot; (1942).

At the age of 14 in 1943, Suraiya appeared as a heroine in J.K. Nanda&#x27;s film &quot;Ishaara&quot;, opposite Prithviraj Kapoor. The film was the tenth highest grossing release of the year and marked Suraiya&#x27;s first commercial success. Devika Rani, who headed the Bombay Talkies production company, seeing Suraiya&#x27;s blooming brilliance as an actress and as a singer signed her on a five-year contract at Rs. 500 per month with her role in &quot;Hamari Baat&quot; (1943). In the film, she played the second lead alongside Devika Rani and had a duet dance and her song with Arun Kumar, &quot;Bistar Bicha Diya Hai Tere Ghar Ke Samne&quot; became very popular. It eventually earned her more success and became the eighth highest grossing release of the year.

===Rise to prominence and success (1944–1947)===
With no film release in 1944, the year 1945 proved to be a crucial year in Suraiya&#x27;s career. She had five films that year, including &quot;Yateem&quot;, &quot;Samrat Chandragupta&quot; and &quot;Main Kya Karoon&quot;. The five-year contract was revoked by Devika Rani on Suraiya&#x27;s request, when K. Asif offered Suraiya Rs. 40,000 for his directorial debut &quot;Phool&quot;. She played Shama alongside Prithviraj Kapoor. The film &quot;Tadbir&quot; marked her first film with K. L. Saigal, who liked her voice during a rehearsal of a song for Jayant Desai&#x27;s film &quot;Samrat Chandragupt&quot;, in which she was acting. He recommended her to Desai, opposite himself in &quot;Tadbir&quot;, where she played his lover Saguna. &quot;Phool&quot; and &quot;Tadbir&quot; became the fourth and fifth highest-grossing films of the year respectively. Baburao Patel in his review for &quot;Filmindia&quot;, praised Suraiya as the lead in &quot;Tadbir&quot;.

The films &quot;Jag Biti&quot; and &quot;1857&quot; were Suraiya&#x27;s first two releases of the year 1946. In &quot;1857&quot;, that was set against the backdrop of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, she played Tasnim opposite Surendra. Suraiya then acted as the second lead in Mehboob Khan&#x27;s &quot;Anmol Ghadi&quot; (1946) with Noor Jehan as the lead with Surendra. She played a willful village girl Basanti. Praising her performance in &quot;Anmol Ghadi&quot;, Dinesh Raheja of &quot;Rediff.com&quot; noted: &quot;True to her name Basanti, Suraiya wafts through the film like a rejuvenating spring breeze. She is achingly young and full of beans.&quot; Despite Jehan&#x27;s presence, the film proved to be a major breakthrough for Suraiya. She then reunited with K. L. Saigal in &quot;Omar Khaiyyam&quot;, playing Mehru. &quot;1857&quot;, &quot;Anmol Ghadi&quot; and &quot;Omar Khaiyyam&quot; emerged among the year&#x27;s highest grossing releases and consolidated Suraiya&#x27;s career.

Suraiya had five film releases in the year of India&#x27;s independence. She first played the free spirited Gopi, who is suspected to have an affair with a married man in &quot;Parwana&quot;. Although by then she had a few hit songs, the four solo songs which she sang in &quot;Parwana&quot; for music director Khwaja Khurshid Anwar made her a genuine singer-film star. It marked her final film with Saigal, who died a month before the film&#x27;s release. Suraiya then appeared in &quot;Dak Bangla&quot;, &quot;Naatak&quot;, &quot;Do Dil&quot; and &quot;Do Naina&quot;. Her last film of the year was &quot;Dard&quot;, with Munawwar Sultana as the lead actress and Nusrat as the hero. She played Hamida, who falls in love with a doctor. Her film &quot;Dard&quot; became a surprise hit and along with &quot;Parwana&quot;, it was one of the year&#x27;s biggest success.

===Critical acclaim and superstardom (1948–1954)===
Noor Jehan and Khursheed&#x27;s departure to Pakistan, inadvertently added to Suraiya&#x27;s success. Between 1948 and 1950, Suraiya earned both critical and commercial success. In 1948, she first played the lead opposite Motilal Rajvansh in &quot;Aaj Ki Raat&quot;. She next played the titular role in &quot;Kajal&quot; and appeared in &quot;Gajre&quot;. The year marked her first project opposite Dev Anand, who was relatively new. In &quot;Vidya&quot;, she played a wealthy woman who falls in love with a poor cobbler. While shooting for &quot;Vidya&quot;, she became romantically involved with him. When her film opposite Rehman, &quot;Pyar Ki Jeet&quot; was released, it caused large crowds outside Suraiya&#x27;s house that was uncontrollable. Suraiya also acted in &quot;Shakti&quot; and &quot;Rang Mahal&quot; that year. Out of these seven films, &quot;Pyar Ki Jeet&quot; became the biggest hit. In her films with Anand, Suraiya was always the first biller in the credits, indicating her stardom. As per the book, &quot;The Women of Punjab&quot;, as a singing actress opposite Anand, her films achieved umpteen jubilees.

The year 1949 marked the peak of Suraiya&#x27;s success with 11 film releases, a rare feat for an actress at that point of time. &quot;Naach&quot;, &quot;Lekh&quot;, &quot;Duniya&quot; and &quot;Char Din&quot; were mediocre films. She then played a married woman Shanta, whose husband loves a dancer in &quot;Singaar&quot;. Suraiya then reunited with Dev Anand in &quot;Jeet&quot; (as Jeet) and &quot;Shair&quot; (as Rani), playing his childhood sweetheart in both these films. Suraiya then played Kamla in &quot;Balam&quot; and Kanchan in &quot;Amar Kahani&quot;. In &quot;Dillagi&quot;, Suraiya played Mala, who is in love with Swaroop (played by Shyam), but is forced to marry someone else. Deepa Gahlot praised the film and added it in her book &quot;50 Films that Deserve a New Audience&quot;. Her last film of the year was &quot;Badi Behen&quot; with Rehman, where she played a protective elder sister Shyama. During the premiere of &quot;Badi Behen&quot;, there was a very large crowd outside the cinema hall and the police had to baton-charge when Suraiya was walking into the hall. Suraiya stopped going to the premieres of her films, after the incident. &quot;Dillagi&quot;, &quot;Badi Behen&quot; and &quot;Singaar&quot; were the biggest commercial successes of the year.

In 1950, Suraiya&#x27;s first few releases were &quot;Shaan&quot;, &quot;Khiladi&quot; and &quot;Kamal Ke Phool&quot;. She then acted opposite Dev Anand in &quot;Nilli&quot; and 
. In &quot;Nilli&quot;, she plays the titular role of an ordinary girl turned into a princess, while &quot;Afsar&quot; was the first film produced under Anand&#x27;s production Navketan Films, with Suraiya playing Bimla. Her biggest success of the year was &quot;Dastan&quot;. Suraiya played an orphan Indira opposite Raj Kapoor. Bhaichand Patel stated that Suraiya&#x27;s acting &quot;over-shadowed&quot; that of Kapoor. From the mid-to late 1940s to the early 1950s, Suraiya was the highest-paid and most popular star of the Indian cinema. From 1948 to 1949, she appeared in over 18 films, most of which turned out to be among the highest grossing releases of the year. From 1945 to 1954, she acted in twelve highest-grossing films.

During the years 1951–53, Suraiya&#x27;s career saw a fluctuation with a series of commercial failures—in the films &quot;Shokiyan&quot;, &quot;Rajput&quot;, &quot;Resham&quot;, &quot;Moti Mahal&quot;, &quot;Lal Kunwar&quot;, &quot;Khubsoorat&quot;, &quot;Goonj&quot; and &quot;Mashuqa&quot;. The last two films opposite Dev Anand &quot;Do Sitare&quot; and &quot;Sanam&quot; (as Sadhana Devi) were moderate hits. &quot;Sanam&quot; marked their last film together as post that, Suraiya and Anand never worked together. The only major commercial success in this period was &quot;Diwana&quot; opposite Suresh. She played a nomadic woman Laali who was married to a prince, but was separated by his father. The film became a success and celebrated a Silver Jubilee at the box office, becoming Suraiya&#x27;s second film after &quot;Anmol Ghadi&quot; to do so.

Suraiya made a comeback in 1954. She played a tawaif Moti Begum in her career&#x27;s most notable film, &quot;Mirza Ghalib&quot;, which won two awards at the 1954 National Film Awards. Suraiya shone both as an actress and as a singer for her rendition of Ghalib&#x27;s lover, Chaudvin. Jawaharlal Nehru, commented on seeing the film, &quot;Tumne Mirza Ghalib kii ruuh ko zindaa kar diyaa,&quot; (&quot;You have brought the soul of Mirza Ghalib back to life&quot;). While reviewing the film, Samira Sood of &quot;The Print&quot; called Suraiya the &quot;soul&quot; of the film and stated: &quot;This movie belongs to Suraiya, whose voice communicates not only love, longing, hope and heartbreak, but the centuries-old magic of Ghalib.&quot; In her next release, Suraiya again played a courtesan, named Chintamani in &quot;Bilwamangal&quot;. Later, Suraiya played Shobha, whose husband dies in war in &quot;Waris&quot; and Sahebzadi Aalam, whose is in love with a poet in &quot;Shama Parwana&quot;, opposite Shammi Kapoor. Among these, &quot;Waaris&quot; turned out to be a moderate success.

===Later work, setback and retirement (1955–1964)===
In the mid-50s, Suraiya told Lata Mangeshkar once that she would soon be cutting down on her films. Lata told her not to do so. After 1954, Suraiya started to cut down on her work and appeared in films occasionally. Her two releases of 1955 were &quot;Kanchan&quot; (1955), which was released in 1949 as &quot;Amar Kahani&quot; and re-released as &quot;Kanchan&quot;, and &quot;Inam&quot;. In 1956, she played a protective sister Jyoti in &quot;Mr. Lambu&quot;, which was a box office hit. In 1958, Suraiya appeared in three films: &quot;Trolly Driver&quot;, with Rehman where she played Renu, &quot;Miss 1958&quot; and &quot;Maalik&quot;. Post a two-year absence, Suraiya appeared as Roshan Ara in &quot;Shama&quot; in 1961.

The 1963 film &quot;Rustam Sohrab&quot;, with Prithviraj Kapoor was her last film. Suraiya played a princess Shehzadi Tahmina opposite Kapoor&#x27;s Rustom Zabuli. Suraiya in an interview said that during the shooting of the film, she suffered from low blood pressure, which she cited as the reason for her retirement from acting. Her song &quot;Ye kaisi ajab dastan ho gayi hai&quot;, from the film is considered among her best songs. Suraiya&#x27;s final film association was in 1964, when she produced the film &quot;Shagoon&quot;. She produced the film under the name Suraiya Mubin. For her contribution to the Indian cinema, Suraiya received the Screen Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996 and Bimal Roy Memorial Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999.

===Incomplete projects===
Suraiya&#x27;s film &quot;Jaanwar&quot; in the early 1950s with Dilip Kumar as the leading star (and K. Asif as director), was left incomplete by her, as she refused to act in the film, because of rough behaviour by Dilip Kumar during the shooting of the film, when he tore her blouse and bruised her back so badly that it took a month to heal. Later, director-producer K. Asif wanted a kissing scene. Suraiya knew that censors would not pass it. When she asked Asif how he would get it through the censors, he could not satisfy her and she withdrew from the film. There was another story also, that Dilip Kumar and K. Asif were hand in glove to exploit and humiliate Suraiya, because Suraiya had earlier ignored Dilip Kumar&#x27;s plea to act with her. So they did some torrid scene and kept on repeating it for four days. Fed up with this ghastly behaviour of the two, Suraiya refused to act for them and withdrew from the film. In 1953, Suraiya refused the film &quot;Anarkali&quot; as heroine, a role which went to Bina Rai.

Two other of her films were left incompleted, one of which was &quot;Pagalkhana&quot; (also, in early 50s), with Bharat Bhushan as lead actor, which was abandoned by the producer director P.L. Santoshi after eight reels, because of financial constraints. The other was an English version of &quot;Wajid Ali Shah&quot;, starring Suraiya and Ashok Kumar in 1953, being filmed by British film director Herbert Marshall, was shelved after being made for some time. A number of her films were announced with advertisements in film magazines, but were partially made or did not take off. These were &quot;Palken&quot; with Shekhar, to be produced and directed by Devendra Goel, for Goel Cine Corporation; &quot;Gumrah&quot; by Globe Pictures, Bombay; &quot;Nigah&quot; by CB Films; &quot;Sanwri&quot; by Kundi Art Productions, produced and directed by Niranjan and &quot;Ching Chow&quot; to be produced by Nigaristan (producers of &quot;Moti Mahal&quot;). Later, it was revealed that Suraiya was K. Asif&#x27;s first choice to play Anarkali in &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; (1960).

==Music career==
Suraiya is regarded as the first actor-singer of Independent India. In his book, Tilak Rishi noted: &quot;Suraiya was people&#x27;s choice as the most popular singing superstar&quot;. She made her singing debut as a child-singer was &quot;Boot Karun Main Polish Babu&quot; in the film &quot;Nai Duniya&quot; (1942), composed by Naushad. She went on to sing playback for actress Mehtab for &quot;Sharda&quot; (1942), &quot;Kanoon&quot; (1943) and &quot;Sanjog&quot; (1942–43) for Naushad and A.R. Kardar (director-producer), when her principal, Miss P.F. Puttack, took a strong view of her truancy from school, and her &#x27;adventure&#x27; came to an abrupt halt. When Mehtab first saw baby Suraiya, she was hesitant to have her as her playback singer, but on hearing her, she wanted Suraiya to sing all her songs in her films. Even in later years, in 1946, Mehtab was so attached to Suraiya&#x27;s singing, that she requested Suraiya to record disc versions of her songs in her film &quot;Shama&quot; (1946), produced by Sohrab Modi, when Suraiya had become a busy heroine and had left singing playback in films for Mehtab. Suraiya then sang for Mehtab, in her own disc versions which were recorded by Shamshad Begum in the film.

Suraiya debuted with Manna Dey in his first Hindi film song, and their only duet &#x27;Jago ayee usha&#x27; in &quot;Tamanna&quot; in 1942, was directed by his uncle, the famous K. C. Dey. Again in 1942, Suraiya paired with Rajkumari in &quot;Station Master&quot; ( with music director Naushad) for the song &#x27;Sajan ghar aye&#x27;. Suraiya acted in both these films. In 1943, Suraiya sang a song &quot;Ek Tu Hoo, Ek Main Hoon&quot;, music composed by Naushad, in the film &quot;Kanoon&quot;, which was the first song in Bombay music industry, which had characteristics of Latin American music. The song &quot;Bistar Bicha Liya Hai Tere Dar Ke Samne Ghar Hum Ne Le Liya hai Tere Ghar ke Samne&quot;, which Suraiya sang in duet with Arun Kumar for the film &quot;Hamari Baat&quot; (1943) was a major success.

A few years later, the singer-actor, K. L. Saigal was so impressed by the singing of the 16-year-old Suraiya, that he agreed to have her opposite him in the film &quot;Tadbir&quot; as a heroine and a singer in 1945. The music was directed by Lal Mohammad in the film. &quot;Rani khol de dawar milne ka din aa gaya&quot; is a memorable song from the film, she sang it with Saigal. Saigal again opted for Suraiya as his heroine and a singer in the films &quot;Omar Khayyam&quot; (1946) (with music director Lal Mohammad) and &quot;Parwana&quot; (1947) (with music director Khurshid Anwar). &quot;Parwana&quot; was Saigal&#x27;s last film and was released after his death. Later, Suraiya continued to work with music director Naushad in a few films, and in 1946, she appeared with actress Noor Jehan in &quot;Anmol Ghadi&quot; as a co-star, with Naushad as the music director. She sang three songs in the film which became popular, of which &#x27;Man leta hai angdai&#x27; went viral throughout the country. The musical film &quot;Dillagi&quot; (1949), under Kardar&#x27;s direction, with Naushad&#x27;s music, became a silver jubilee hit, with Suraiya becoming a national rage with her songs and acting. She sang about 51 songs for Naushad.

Suraiya&#x27;s hits included songs like &quot;Woh paas rahen ya door rahen&quot;, &quot;Tere nainon ne chori kiya&quot;, &quot;Tu mera chand, main teri chandni&quot;, &quot;Man mor hua matwala&quot;, and &quot;Nain diwane ik nahin mane&quot;. Khurshid Anwar was the music director in three films of Suraiya, viz. &quot;Ishara&quot; (1943), &quot;Parwana&quot; (1947) and &quot;Singaar&quot; (1949). Suraiya sang 13 songs in these films. With the music director duo, Husnlal Bhagatram, Suraiya sang in 10 films and recorded the most songs (58, excluding 6 repeat songs for the film &quot;Kanchan&quot;) for any music director from 1948 to 1958. The films were &quot;Pyar Ji Jeet&quot; (1948), &quot;Aaj Ki Raat&quot; (1948), &quot;Naach&quot; (1949), &quot;Balam&quot; (1949), &quot;Bari Behen&quot;(1949), &quot;Amar Kahani&quot;(1949), &quot;Sanam&quot; (1951), &quot;Shama Parwana&quot;(1954), &quot;Kanchan&quot; (1955) and &quot;Trolley Driver&quot; (1955). Her song &quot;O, door janewale, wada na bhul jana&quot; in &quot;Pyar Ki Jeet&quot; in 1948 became a hit all over India. Suraiya did only three films with music composer Sachin Dev Burman &quot;Vidya&quot; (1948), (1949) and &quot;Lal Kunwar&quot; (1952), as she was associated with other composers, and S.D. Burman came late into the scene in Bombay. Yet, most of their songs are memorable. &quot;Man mor hua matwala&quot; (in ), &quot;Nain Deewane&quot;, &quot;Layi khushi ki dunia&quot; (with Mukesh in &#x27;Vidya&#x27;) and &quot;Preet sataye teri yaad na&quot; in &quot;Lal Kunwar&quot; being some of them.

Ghulam Mohammad gave music for the National Award-winning film &quot;Mirza Ghalib&quot; (1954), in which she sang memorable songs of Mirza Ghalib. &quot;Kajal&quot;, &quot;Shair&quot; and &quot;Shama&quot; were other films for which he composed music for Suraiya. Other directors who composed music for her in her film songs, include C. Ramchandra in the film &quot;Dewana&quot;, Roshan in the film &quot;Masuka&quot;, K. Dutta (in the films, &quot;Rang Mahal&quot; and &quot;Yateem&quot;), Krishen Dayal (in the film, &quot;Lekh&quot; for songs, such as, &quot;Dil ka qarar lut gaya&quot; and &quot;Badra ki chaon tale&quot;), S. Mohinder (in &quot;Nilli&quot;), Sardul Kwatra (in &quot;Goonj&quot;), Madan Mahan (in &quot;Khubsoorat&quot;), Roshan (in &quot;Mashuqa&quot; for songs, such as, &quot;Mera bachpan wapas aya&quot;), S.N.Tripahi (in &quot;Inaam&quot;), O.P. Nayyar (in &quot;Mr. Lamboo&quot;) and N. Dutta (in &quot;Miss 58&quot;). The music for her film, &quot;Main kya karoon&quot; (1945) was composed by Nino Mujamdar, for the film &quot;Shakti&quot; by Ram Prashad. Hansraj Behl composed music for the films &quot;Khilari&quot; (songs, such as, &quot;Chahat ka bhulana mushkil hai&quot; and Dil nashad na ro&quot;), &quot;Shaan&quot; (songs, such as, &quot;Tarap ae dil&quot;), &quot;Rajput&quot;, &quot;Moti Mehal&quot; and &quot;Resham&quot;. Her music director in the film &quot;Shokian&quot; (songs, such as, &quot;Ratoon ki neend chheen li&quot;) was Jamal Sen and Bilo C. Rani directed music in the film &quot;Bilwamangal&quot; (songs, such as, &quot;Parwano se preet sekh le&quot;), Shyam Sunder gave music for her films, &quot;Char Din&quot; and &quot;Kamal ke Phool&quot;. Sajjad Husain was her music director in two films, viz. &quot;1857&quot; and &quot;Rustom Sohrab&quot;.

==Personal life==
Suraiya was in a relationship with actor Dev Anand for four years from 1948 to 1951. Anand nicknamed Suraiya &quot;Nosey&quot;, while to Suraiya, Dev Anand was &quot;Steve&quot;, a name chosen from a book Dev Anand had given her. Suraiya also called Anand &quot;Devina&quot; and he called her &quot;Suraiyana&quot;, while faking an Italian accent. Kamini Kaushal, who worked with Suraiya and Anand in &quot;Shair&quot; (1949), said in an interview to &quot;Filmfare&quot; in 2014, that Suraiya would pass on her letters to her to be delivered to Anand, when her grandmother started keeping an eye on their love-affair.

During the shooting of &quot;Jeet&quot; (1949), both Anand and Suraiya, had made plans for marriage and elopement, but at the last minute, an assistant director, jealous of their marriage, informed Suraiya&#x27;s grandmother, who dragged her home from the scene. In the &#x27;Star and Style&#x27; interview, Suraiya said that she gave in only when both her grandmother and her maternal uncle threatened to get Dev Anand killed. While shooting (1950), Dev Anand again proposed to her and gave her an engagement diamond ring worth rupees 3000. Suraiya&#x27;s maternal grandmother, was fiercely opposed to Suraiya marrying Anand. She was supported by Suraiya&#x27;s maternal uncle Zahoor and some film persons, viz. composer Naushad, director-producer A.R. Kardar, lyricist Naqshab and director M. Sadiq. Her grandmother had opposed the relationship, mainly because they were Muslims and Anand was a Hindu. The covert reason was that Suraiya was the only earning member of the family.

Suraiya and Anand were stopped from acting together after their last film in 1951 by her grandmother. Thereafter, Suraiya remained unmarried by her own choice for the rest of her life. In an interview with &quot;Stardust&quot;, in June 1972, Suraiya revealed that she lacked the courage to resist her family and that Anand truly loved her. Anand wanted her to be bold and marry him in a civil court, but she refused. Dev Anand went on to marry Kalpana Kartik two years later in 1954 in a hurried simple marriage. Suraiya remained unmarried all her life.

=== Friendships ===
While working as a child artist at All India Radio, Suraiya became friends with Raj Kapoor and Madan Mohan, who later became an actor and music director respectively. Suraiya shared a cordial relationship with many people from the industry and was friends with Paidi Jairaj, Nimmi, Nirupa Roy, Tabassum and lyricist Hasan Kamal. Suraiya established a close bond with composer Naushad, whom she considered her mentor. Naushad stated that post her departure from the industry, Suraiya limited her friends circle and met only few people occasionally.

==Later life and death==
In 1963, Suraiya retired from acting career, supposedly due to two reasons. Her father Aziz Jamal Sheikh died that year, and because of her health problems. Suraiya lived with her mother Mumtaz Begum after her father&#x27;s death. Her friends in the industry were Paidi Jairaj, Nimmi, Nirupa Roy and Tabassum, whom she met occasionally. In 1979, Suraiya gave an interview to Raju Bhartan for &quot;The Illustrated Weekly of India&quot;, gaining limelight. After her mother&#x27;s death in 1987, Suraiya became lonely. She lived in Krishna Mahal, Marine Drive, since the early 1940s. Suraiya possessed several apartments in Worli, Mumbai and property in Lonavala, near Pune.

Suraiya was concerned about the increase of sexualized imagery and violence in films. Speaking at a 1994 Cine Society event, she decried the producers&#x27; evident idea that this was good entertainment, and the Censor Board&#x27;s overly lax &quot;see no evil, speak no evil&quot; approach to the matter. She said this was &quot;leading the new generation in a wrong direction&quot;.

In December 1998, Suraiya then over 68 years old, while in New Delhi to receive the Sahitya Academy Award during Mirza Ghalib&#x27;s bi-centenary celebrations, talked in a low voice and declined to sing, saying she had left “mosiqui (music) years ago”. Tabassum, who worked with Suraiya said, &quot;It&#x27;s sad that she had shut her doors to the world in her last days. But she&#x27;d talk comfortably with me on the phone. I remember our last conversation. I asked her: &quot;Aapa kaisi hain?&quot; (Elder sister, how are you?&quot;) She replied in verse: &quot;Kaisi guzar rahi hai sabhi poochte hai mujhse, kaise guzaarti hoon koi nahin poochta.&quot;( &quot;Everybody asks me &#x27;how are you&#x27;, but nobody asks me how I spend my days and nights.&quot;) (As told to Farhana Farook in 2012).

Suraiya died at Mumbai&#x27;s Harkishandas Hospital on 31 January 2004 aged 75, after being admitted there for a week previously suffering from various ailments, including hypoglycemia, ischaemia and insulinoma. Among her visitors were Sunil Dutt, Naushad and Pratap A. Rana. Actor Dharmendra, who was her ardent fan, attended her funeral. She was buried at Badakabarastan in Marine Lines, Mumbai. During the last six months of her life, Suraiya lived with her lawyer, Dhimant Thakkar and his family. After her death, Suraiya&#x27;s property at Worli and her house at Marine Drive went into legal dispute, as she did not leave behind an explicit will. In 2006, Mumbai High Court granted her Pakistani cousin, Mehfooz Ahmed (maternal uncle M. Zahoor&#x27;s son) the right to administer the estate. In 2008, Ahmed, who never met her for over 40 years before her death, got the right to the rented house at Krishna Mahal, valued at 7.5 crores rupees, as a tenant by the High Court judgement (according to Mumbai&#x27;s old rent control laws) over her family lawyer. The cousin had no objection to the house being sold.

==Public image==
Suraiya is regarded as one of the greatest and most accomplished actresses of Indian cinema. She is noted for her simple roles, sweet voice and beauty. One of the highest paid actress of the 1940s and 1950s, Suraiya appeared in &quot;Box Office India&quot;″s &quot;Top Actresses&quot; list seven times, from 1944 to 1950, and topped the list for three years (1948–1950). &quot;Box Office India&quot; also named her as the &quot;Best Actress&quot; of the 1940–1949 period. In 2022, she topped &quot;Outlook India&quot;″s &quot;75 Best Bollywood Actresses&quot; list. In 2013, Suraiya&#x27;s film looks were voted as the &quot;Best on-screen beauty&quot;, on the completion of 100 years of the Indian cinema. Suraiya set fashion trends, that are still relevant and her sarees are a major style statement of the 1940s and 1950s.

After Suraiya established her career as a leading lady, she subsequently use to charge ₹1 lakh to ₹2 lakh per film and had a collection of limousines, including a Buick and a Lincoln. Suraiya was the highest paid actress of her time and was the first Indian actress who was paid more than her male co-actors. In his book &quot;The Immortal Queen Suraiya&quot;, Ranjan Sain wrote about her work ethics, he said, &quot;Suraiya&#x27;s day began with recitations from the Holy Quran, some exercise and breakfast. Next were shoots at the studios where she was known to be very friendly and treated everyone with respect. She had no airs or demands and would make no fuss about anything, from her hair and makeup to costumes, camera angles, footage or dialogues. She faced the camera with confidence and accepted the outcome with grace.&quot; Commenting on Suraiya&#x27;s stardom, Ismat Chughtai stated: &quot;After her early work as a singer, Suraiya took a big leap and became a film star — one who sparkled so brightly that for a while, even Nargis paled before her.

In 1946, Suraiya&#x27;s film &quot;Anmol Ghadi&quot; celebrated Silver Jubilee (25 weeks continuous run in one or more cinema halls) in Bombay and other cities of India. In 1951, the inaugural issue of the film news-weekly &quot;Screen&quot; featured Suraiya on its cover. In the early fifties, her singing made a significant mark in people&#x27;s lives [in India and Pakistan], so much so that fruit sellers sold watermelons in her name, &quot;Le lo babuji bade meethein hai, Suraiya ke khet ke hai.&quot; (These watermelons are as sweet as Suraiya&#x27;s voice). Actor Dharmendra admitted to being a big fan of the actress. He remembers walking miles to see Suraiya&#x27;s &quot;Dillagi&quot; 40 times. Singer Lata Mangeshkar confessed to look up to her and said, &quot;Suraiyaji sang mostly her songs on screen, and not for others. In my opinion, she was a very refined actress, truly gifted. Her acting was subtle and sensitive.&quot; Actors Iftekhar, Rehman and director M. Sadiq admired Suraiya and had expressed their desire to marry the actress. Due to her perceived appeal, Suraiya became one of the brand ambassadors of beauty products by Lux.

On her films and roles, Suraiya stated: &quot;Most of my roles were simple, but the audiences loved them. I was lucky to have got simple, melodious and easy to pick up songs to sing, and work with the best composers of the day like Naushad, Husnlal-Bhagatram and Anil Biswas.&quot; Post the release of her film &quot;Bari Behen&quot; (1949), Suraiya stopped attending film premieres. Suraiya said, &quot;When I went for the premiere of the movie, there was such a big crowd outside! As I walked into the theatre, they pulled at my clothes. There was a lathi charge and people were injured. I stopped going for premieres thereafter.&quot; Suraiya was known to be the most popular actress in the early years of Independence and was known for her female characters that &quot;stood shoulder-to-shoulder&quot; with their male counterparts. T. J. S. George stated in &quot;The Life and Times of Nargis&quot; that, Suraiya ruled &quot;unchallenged&quot; post partition. In his book &quot;Bollywood&#x27;s Top 20 Superstars of Indian Cinema&quot;, Niranjan Iyengar wrote about her and noted: &quot;Suraiya had become a national rage post her success in 1948-1949. Her glamour was hailed by film scribes as comparable to actresses Rita Hayworth, Lana Turner and Ava Gardner&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
Suraiya was known as the first superstar singer-actress of Indian films. She was widely successful as an actress and singer and was called &quot;Singing Star&quot;. Music director Naushad found Suraiya&#x27;s voice as the voice of the girl next door. He said, &quot;It was an unsophisticated and charming voice and very effortless.&quot; Journalist Rauf Ahmed added Suriya on his &quot;Biggest stars in Hindi filmdom&quot; list and noted, &quot;A singing sensation of her time, Suraiya was the first female star. No one has been able to emulate her.&quot; A writer from &quot;Saregama&quot; noted, &quot;A singer by nature, an actress by coincidence, and a legend by her own making; Suraiya was the last actor and singer in Hindi cinema back in the 1940s before the era of playback singers kicked in.&quot; Pran Nevile of &quot;The Hindu&quot; termed her an &quot;unforgettable singing legend&quot; and noted, &quot;In her heyday, she turned a legend and the highest paid artiste of her time. During the mid-forties, she dominated the film world with her music.&quot; In &quot;The Immortal Queen Suraiya&quot;, Ranjan Sain stated: &quot;Suraiya became a huge star, yet was very disciplined and handled her busy work schedule efficiently. With 11 releases in 1949 [something no other actress had achieved], she unleashed hysteria all over the country.&quot;

===Screen image—acting and singing style===
Suraiya is known among the finest actresses of Indian cinema. Alongside Noor Jehan, she was the biggest star in the country before Independence. She earned praises with her roles in the films: &quot;Anmol Ghadi&quot;, &quot;Vidya&quot;, &quot;Pyar Ki Jeet&quot;, &quot;Bari Behen&quot;, &quot;Dillagi&quot;, &quot;Dastaan&quot; and &quot;Mirza Ghalib&quot;. From 1948 to 1949, a trio of hits—&quot;Pyar Ki Jeet&quot;, &quot;Badi Behan&quot; and &quot;Dillagi&quot;—made Suraiya a star. In the post-independence era, the cinema initially was mainly female-oriented, with Suraiya being the front-runner. Her path-breaking roles include portrayal of a willful girl in &quot;Anmol Ghadi&quot;, a strong and protective sister in &quot;Bari Behen&quot; and &quot;Mr. Lambu&quot;, a wealthy women in love with a poor cobbler in &quot;Vidya&quot;, an orphan in &quot;Dastaan&quot;, a nomadic woman in &quot;Diwana&quot;, a courtesan in &quot;Mirza Ghalib&quot; and &quot;Bilwamangal&quot;, and a princess in &quot;Rustam Sohrab&quot;. She named her roles in the films - &quot;Parwana&quot;, &quot;Kajal&quot; and &quot;Mirza Ghalib&quot; as her favourites.

The author of &quot;Celebrities: A Comprehensive Biographical Thesaurus of Important Men and Women in India&quot;, credited Suraiya for saving several films, with her &quot;fine portrayals and dulcet songs&quot;. Arushi Jain of &quot;The Indian Express&quot; said that she was the highest-paid actor, earning more than her male counterparts. She noted, &quot;Indian audiences of a certain vintage will remember Suraiya as a mesmerising face, a soulful voice and a graceful performer during 1940-1950s.&quot; Asjad Nazir of &quot;Eastern Eye&quot; termed her &quot;screen queen&quot; and said, &quot;The biggest music and film star in India created the kind of mania with fans not seen before, with unprecedented crowds gathering to catch a glimpse of her.&quot; Journalist Adi Katrak called her, the first artist of the film industry to enjoy &quot;star value&quot; and noted her 1940s stardom to be bigger than that of Nargis and Dilip Kumar. He also noted how Suraiya was a &quot;freelance&quot;, not bounded by contracts of big productions.

Suraiya generally preferred &quot;spunky roles&quot; in contrast to her submissive, swooning peers. Her strong female characters were a significant feature of pre-independence Indian films. According to Kanana Jhingana, Suraiya acted as a link to connect &quot;tradition and modernity&quot; with her films, her work represented the inclusion of Muslim voices and bodies in the aural/visual composite of Hindi cinema. Dinesh Raheja of &quot;Rediff.com&quot; noted, &quot;Save for her arresting, almond-shaped eyes, Suraiya was not a classic beauty; nor did she trained in classical music. But, what gave her an edge over contemporaries Kamini Kaushal and Nargis was her ability to sing her own songs. Suraiya&#x27;s dastaan, ajeeb but fascinating, continues to thrive on lore, speculation and memories.&quot; A journalist of &quot;Outlook India&quot; called her a &quot;singing superstar&quot; and stated, &quot;The only Hindi film actress to be felicitated by two Prime Ministers for the same role – with which she performed a salutary service to Indian literature. Suraiya, both on and off the screen, sent audiences swooning with her films.&quot;

Suraiya was equally known for her singing and was the only actor-singer in Hindi cinema before the start of playback singing era. Commenting on her singing style, Ashok Ranade opined: &quot;Suraiya&#x27;s voice is neither thin nor broad and its strength is clearly felt in pronunciation of individual words, projection of line-endings and the facility with which she moves in the given tonal framework. Suraiya&#x27;s voice is adequate for a kind of singing which maintains a relationship of continuity with speech tone --- a fact often lost sight of&quot;. Manish Telikicherla Chary said that Suraiya dominated the 1940s and 1950s with her singing. Vijay Poolakkal in his book stated that Suraiya was Husnlal Bhagatram&#x27;s first choice as female singer in the 40s. Param Arunachalam of &quot;DNA India&quot; wrote, &quot;Suraiya was among the last of the actor-singers who transitioned gracefully from the live singing to playback singing era.&quot; A &quot;News18 India&quot; writer noted, &quot;In a professional manner, Suraiya&#x27;s performances were distinguished by elegance and grace, and she sang from the depths of passion and tenderness in her heart and soul.&quot;

===Legacy===
In November 1956, Suraiya was sent to the Soviet Union by the Government of India as part of a delegate consisting of Raj Kapoor, Nargis and Kamini Kaushal, where her films were screened. When Suraiya&#x27;s film &quot;Mirza Ghalib&quot; was awarded the President&#x27;s gold medal for the Best Feature Film of 1954 during the 2nd National Film Awards, the then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, praised her acting and songs and said that, Suraiya brought Mirza Ghalib&#x27;s soul to life (Tumne Mirza Ghalib ki rooh ko zindaa kar diyaa). Suraiya later stated that she thought his praise was &quot;more worthy than an Oscar&quot;. In 1998, Suraiya was honoured for perpetuating Mirza Ghalib&#x27;s memory by her acting and songs by the then prime minister of India, Atal Behari Vajpayee during the Mirza Ghalib bi-centenary celebrations in New Delhi. In 2003, Suraiya was honoured and awarded a memento by the Dadasaheb Phalke Academy and Screen World Publication at a special function organised on the 134th birth anniversary of Dadasaheb Phalke.

On her death, Dev Anand said &quot;I felt sad on her death. I did not go to her funeral because I would have been reminded of the past. I cried from a distance.&quot; Anand later wrote about his days with Suraiya in his autobiography, &quot;Romancing With Life&quot; in 2007. Dilip Kumar added, &quot;Suraiya was a caring girl, very affectionate, particularly with junior artistes... Suraiya will be sorely missed, even though she had been a recluse for decades.&quot;

In May 2013, a postage stamp, bearing her image in various roles, was released by the &quot;India Post&quot; of the Government of India to honour her on the occasion of the 100 years of Indian Cinema. Suraiya&#x27;s songs, as a tribute to her, are played every year on her birth anniversary (15 June) and her death anniversary (31 January), by Radio Ceylon. In 2016, Bhaichand Patel wrote about Suraiya in his book &quot;Bollywood&#x27;s Top 20: Superstars of Indian Cinema&quot;. ShemarooMe gave tribute to Suraiya through the shows &quot;Naam Toh Suna Hoga&quot; and &quot;Screen Legends&quot;, in 2021 and 2022 respectively. In 2023, an exhibition at Kiran Nadar Museum of Art in Noida, named &quot;Sitaare Zameen Par&quot;, had portraits of Suraiya that were captured by JH Thakkar. The same year, her souvenirs were auctioned online, along with that of other actresses. In 2024, Ranjan Sain published Suraiya&#x27;s biography, &quot;The Immortal Queen Suraiya&quot;.

Giving tribute to Suraiya, &quot;The Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;The screen goddess and singing star, Suraiya Jamal Sheikh, had the world at her feet. Her career spanned a little over two decades but she left behind a vast repertoire of songs and films for audiences to delight in.&quot; &quot;Outlook&quot; wrote after her death, &quot;She evoked the kind of hysteria [in the late 1940s] that can be compared only with Rajesh Khanna in his heyday from 1969 to 1972. Ask any old-timer and they would confirm that people bunked offices, schools and colleges, even shops closed on the opening day of her films, to see her films first day, first show.&quot; &quot;The Hindu&quot; wrote about Suraiya: &quot;What can you say about a lady, who was courted by Dev Anand, respected by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, but feared by Lata Mangeshkar! That she was beautiful, talented, adored by millions, but died a lonely single woman? Or, that she was the best ever superstar singer-actress of Indian films, yet walked away to a self-imposed exile at the height of her glory? Yes, Suraiya was all this, plus &#x27;a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma&#x27; who resolutely shunned screen and media once she departed from the arc lights.&quot;

<doc id="449341" wikidata="Q1129443" url="?curid=449341" title="Democratic Convergence of Catalonia">
<text>The Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (; , CDC), frequently shortened as Convergence (; ) was a Catalan nationalist, liberal political party in Catalonia (Spain), currently still existing without any political activity.

The party was originally created around the figure of Jordi Pujol in 1974, but it was not legally registered until February 1977. Between 1978 and 2015, the party was a member of the Convergence and Union (CiU) alliance that dominated Catalan politics for almost the entirety of its existence; first as an electoral alliance with the christian democratic Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC), then as a party federation on 2 December 2001. For 37 years, both parties contested all elections under the CiU umbrella, being the first political group in the Parliament of Catalonia for its entire history and forming the regional government for nearly three decades (1980–2003 and 2010–2015). In June 2015, the CiU federation split over the issue of Catalan independence.

On 8–10 July 2016, the party was refounded into the Catalan European Democratic Party (PDeCAT), with CDC&#x27;s political activity being passed to the new party, though CDC has remained active as a way to preserve its public funding and electoral rights in favour of the PDeCAT and the Together for Catalonia alliance. At the time of the party&#x27;s refoundation in July 2016, it had 15,019 members.

The party was founded on 17 November 1974 in Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey as a &quot;political movement&quot; centered around the figure of Jordi Pujol. After the death of dictator Francisco Franco and in the wake of the Spanish transition to democracy, CDC was constituted as a political party in February 1976, being officially registered as such one year later in 1977. Convergence&#x27;s aim would be to articulate itself as a transversal big tent political platform, able of bringing together various social sectors—from left to right in the political spectrum—of public life in Catalonia.

Ahead of the first democratic election on 15 June 1977, CDC formed the Democratic Pact for Catalonia electoral alliance for the Congress of Deputies, together with the Socialist Party of Catalonia–Regrouping (PSC–R), Democratic Left of Catalonia (EDC) and the National Front of Catalonia (FNC); for the Spanish Senate it formed the Democracy and Catalonia coalition with the PSC–R, EDC and Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC). In the spring of 1978, a sector of the party unsuccessfully proposed its renaming as &quot;Nationalist Party of Catalonia&quot;, a name which would be used by several party members 42 years later for another political force.

On 19 September 1978, CDC and UDC established the Convergence and Union (CiU) alliance, under which both parties would contest together all elections held in Catalonia throughout the next 37 years together. From the 1979 Spanish general election onwards, CDC and UDC would maintain the CiU alliance for all elections at all levels of administration: local, regional and general.

===Political hegemony===
Until their split in June 2015, the CiU alliance would dominate Catalan regional politics from the 1980s to the early 2000s, providing for Jordi Pujol&#x27;s long stay in the regional government for 23 consecutive years, until a left-wing alliance comprising the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (PSC), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Initiative for Catalonia Greens (ICV) was able to oust CiU from government and into opposition. It would not be until the 2010 Catalan regional election held seven years later that CiU, under Artur Mas&#x27;s leadership, was returned to government.

Beyond its dominance of Catalan politics, CDC sought to have influence in the Spanish parliament, collaborated with governments both under the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) (and more critically, in the 1993–1996 period when the PSOE was forced into a minority government) as well as under the People&#x27;s Party (PP) (1996–2004), giving their support to both parties&#x27;s attempts to form government, then maintaining confidence and supply agreements with them. CiU&#x27;s support to Felipe González&#x27;s government provided for the development of the &quot;state of autonomies&quot; the foundations for the financing of the autonomous communities. Under the PP governments of José María Aznar, CDC supported the liberalizing and budgetary control measures that allowed Spain to eventually adopt the euro as the country&#x27;s currency. In the so-called &quot;Majestic Pacts&quot; signed between CiU and the PP after the latter&#x27;s victory in the 1996 Spanish general election, both parties had also agreed to further expand on the development of regional financing started during González&#x27;s tenure, the abolition of compulsory military service and the devolution of powers to the autonomous communities.

Pujol&#x27;s retirement ahead of the 2003 Catalan regional election prompted Artur Mas—who served as chief minister () and Pujol&#x27;s protégée during the late stages of his government—as his successor as CDC leader and CiU leading candidate. After CiU&#x27;s victory in the 2010 regional election, Mas would become the new president of the Government of Catalonia, introducing previously unseen variable geometry in the region&#x27;s politics: first by partnering with the opposition&#x27;s main party the PSC, then seeking collaboration with the local PP branch for approving the regional budget. As a result of the 11 September 2012 demonstration, Mas sought to capitalize on the social momentum of independence by triggering a snap election for 25 November, hoping to expand his parliamentary majority and attain an absolute majority; instead, his party suffered a severe setback by falling from 62 to 50 seats, having to rely on the support of the pro-independence Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) to keep himself in power. Frictions with CDC&#x27;s alliance partner UDC over the issue of independence ended up in the termination of CiU as a political project in June 2015.

Concurrently, the party had been shaken by CDC founder Jordi Pujol&#x27;s confession on 25 July 2014 that he had hidden &quot;money located abroad&quot; from the Public Treasury for 34 years, allegedly attributed to his father&#x27;s, Florenci Pujol, heritage. In his statement, Pujol regretted never having found the &quot;right time&quot; for the regularization of these amounts of money and asked the public for forgiveness. Various media outlets pointed out that this money was located in secret bank accounts abroad and could have benefitted from the fiscal amnesty promoted by the Spanish government of Mariano Rajoy in 2012. Coupled with the ongoing judicial investigations on an alleged CDC corruption scandal involving the payment of illegal commissions in exchange for the award of public works—in what would be known as the &quot;3% case&quot; because of that amount being the percentage of the public works&#x27; budgets that was to be illegally paid—Pujol&#x27;s confession caused a profound commotion in Catalan society, which had the former president as a revered public figure with a large amount of influence.

Following CiU&#x27;s breakup, CDC contested the 2015 Catalan regional election within the Junts pel Sí coalition, and the 2015 Spanish general election within the Democracy and Freedom alliance. The 2016 Spanish general election would be the only one in CDC&#x27;s long electoral history which the party would contest entirely on its own.

===Refoundation and legacy===
In a party ballot held on 21 May 2016 to determine the party&#x27;s future, CDC members were asked whether they backed a &quot;renovation&quot; of the party as it was, or instead supported a full &quot;refoundation&quot; with the establishment of a new, different party, leading to a 67–32% result in favour of refoundation. As a result, during its congress held from 8 to 10 July 2016, the new Catalan European Democratic Party (PDeCAT) was established, out of a desire for presenting a renewed trademark disassociated from CDC&#x27;s corruption scandals, occurring during its long-term dominance of Catalan regional politics. The refoundation, intended as a pre-ordained scheme which the party&#x27;s grassroots ultimately took away from its leadership, would only hasten the blurring of the post-convergent political space, after seeing the loss of the historical CDC label, the dilution of the PDeCAT within the Junts pel Sí parliamentary group with a number of various parties and independents, the increasing influence of Catalan president Carles Puigdemont in regional politics even after his ousting and subsequent self-exile in late October 2017 and the eventual coalescing of former pro-independence CDC members around the Together for Catalonia umbrella, dominated by Puigdemont&#x27;s own party, the National Call for the Republic.

Several parties would be formed from splinter CDC/PDeCAT elements weary of Puigdemont&#x27;s growing influence and seeking to occupy the vacuum left by CiU&#x27;s dissolution and appeal to Convergence&#x27;s &quot;orphan&quot; voters. These included the Free (Lliures) party founded by former regional minister Antoni Fernández Teixidó, Convergents (CNV) of former regional minister of justice Germà Gordó, the Democratic League (LD) of political scientist Astrid Barrio and the Nationalist Party of Catalonia (PNC) led by former PDeCAT coordinator-general between 2016 and 2018 Marta Pascal.

===Corruption convictions===
On 15 January 2018, a court in Barcelona ruled that CDC had received €6.6 million in illegal commissions from building firm Ferrovial between 1999 and 2009, in exchange for public works contracts. The scheme used the Palau de la Música Catalana concert venue as a front for false invoicing. Twelve people were jailed and fined millions. The former CDC treasurer Daniel Osàcar was sentenced to four years and five months in prison and fined €3.7 million for influence peddling and money laundering. Fèlix Millet, the former director of the Palau, was jailed for just under 10 years and fined €4.1 million and his deputy, Jordi Montull, received a 7 years and six months sentence and was fined €2.9 million. Millet and Montull were the individuals who benefited most from the scam, controlling the Palau&#x27;s funds. The &quot;Turkey Telegraph&quot; noted the &quot;final impunity of the CDC leaders&quot;, and also the impunity for the company that paid illegal commissions. Earlier in January, Artur Mas, who was a close ally of Osàcar, had stepped down as party president.

<doc id="449342" wikidata="Q661871" url="?curid=449342" title="Jägermeister">
<text> ( , ) is a German digestif made with 56 herbs and spices. Developed in 1934 by Wilhelm and Curt Mast, it has an alcohol by volume of 35% (61 degrees proof, or US 70 proof). The recipe has not changed since its creation, and the drink continues to be sold in a green glass bottle. It is the flagship product of Mast-Jägermeister SE headquartered in , Germany.

==History==
Wilhelm Mast was a vinegar manufacturer and wine trader in the city of Wolfenbüttel, Germany. His son, Curt Mast (1897–1970), was passionate about the production of spirits and liqueurs, and always keen to help his father in the business even at an early age. In 1934, at age 37, after he took over his father&#x27;s business, Curt devised the recipe for &quot;Jägermeister&quot;.

Curt was an enthusiastic hunter. The name &quot;Jägermeister&quot; in German literally means &quot;Master Hunter&quot;, &quot;Hunt Master&quot;, or &quot;master of the hunt&quot;. It is a title for a high-ranking official in charge of matters related to hunting and gamekeeping. The term &quot; had existed as a job title for many centuries. In 1934, the new (Reich hunting law) redefined the term, applying it to senior foresters, game wardens, and gamekeepers in the German civil service. was appointed (Reich hunting master) when the new hunting law was introduced. Thus, when Jägermeister was introduced in 1935, its name was already familiar to Germans, who sometimes called the product &quot;.

 came to greater international attention particularly through the work of Sidney Frank (1919–2006), who ran an American liquor importing company. From the 1980s, he promoted the drink in the youth and student market, as a drink for parties – a quite different niche to its traditional conservative brand position in its native German market. &quot;New York&quot; magazine quoted a market research firm describing him as &quot;a promotional genius&quot; for making &quot;a liqueur with an unpronounceable name...drunk by older, blue-collar Germans as an after-dinner digestive aid... synonymous with &#x27;party&#x27;.&quot; The company ultimately purchased Sidney Frank Importing in 2015.

==Composition==
 is a type of liqueur called (herbal liqueur). It is akin to other European liqueurs, such as from Denmark, balsam and from Moldova, from the Netherlands, from Hungary, from the Czech Republic, Gorzka Żołądkowa from Poland, from Slovakia, from Croatia, Riga Black Balsam from Latvia, from Serbia, from Italy, Licor Beirão from Portugal, and and from France. In contrast to those beverages, has a sweeter taste. In Germany itself, there are quite a few competitors, such as , , , , , and , some of which are as sweet as Jägermeister.

&#x27;s ingredients include 56 herbs, fruits, roots, and spices, including citrus peel, licorice, anise, poppy seeds, saffron, ginger, juniper berries, and ginseng. These ingredients are ground, then steeped in water and alcohol for two to three days. This mixture is filtered and stored in oak barrels for about a year. Then the liqueur is filtered again, and mixed with sugar, caramel and alcohol.

The company recommends that be kept on ice and served cold, and suggests that it be kept in a freezer at −18 °C (0 °F) or on tap between .

Contrary to a rumor that has circulated on the internet, does not contain deer or elk blood.

==Label==

The label on Jägermeister bottles features a glowing Christian cross seen between the antlers of a stag. This image is a reference to the two Christian patron saints of hunters, Hubert of Liège and Eustace, both of whom converted to Christianity after experiencing a vision in which they saw a Christian cross between the antlers of a stag.

The product name is written in &quot;textura&quot; and is one of the few surviving examples of the use of the long s in print.

The label contains the following verse from the poem , by the forester, hunter, and ornithologist ; von Riesenthal is not credited on the label.

&lt;poem&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

According to , the translation is:

&lt;poem&gt;It is the hunter&#x27;s honour that he
Protects and preserves his game,
Hunts sportsmanlike, honours the
Creator in His creatures.&lt;/poem&gt;

A loose translation which preserves the rhyme and meter is:

&lt;poem&gt;This is the hunter&#x27;s badge of glory,
That he protect and tend his quarry,
Hunt with honour, as is due,
And through the beast to God is true.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Cocktails==

* A Surfer on Acid is made with equal parts of , Malibu, and pineapple juice.
* The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse is a shot made with equal parts , Rumple Minze, , and Bacardi 151.

<text>Cross of Iron (German: &quot;Steiner – Das Eiserne Kreuz&quot;, lit. &quot;Steiner – The Iron Cross&quot;) is a 1977 war film directed by Sam Peckinpah, featuring James Coburn, Maximilian Schell, James Mason and David Warner. Set on the Eastern Front in World War II during the Soviets&#x27; Caucasus operations against the German Kuban bridgehead on the Taman Peninsula in late 1943, the film focuses on the class conflict between a newly arrived, aristocratic Prussian officer who covets winning the Iron Cross and a cynical, battle-hardened infantry NCO.

An international co-production between British and West German financiers, the film&#x27;s exteriors were shot on location in Yugoslavia.

==Plot==

Corporal Rolf Steiner is a veteran soldier of the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front of World War II. During a successful raid on an enemy mortar position, his reconnaissance platoon captures a Russian boy soldier. As the platoon returns to friendly lines, Captain Stransky arrives to take command of Steiner&#x27;s battalion. The regiment&#x27;s commander, Colonel Brandt, wonders why Stransky would ask to be transferred to the Kuban bridgehead from more comfortable duties in occupied France. Stransky proudly tells Brandt and the regimental adjutant, Captain Kiesel, that he applied for transfer to front-line duty in Russia so that he can win the Iron Cross.

Stransky meets Steiner as he returns from the patrol and orders the prisoner shot. Steiner refuses and Corporal Schnurrbart takes the boy off into hiding. Steiner reports to Stransky shortly after, where he is informed of his promotion to senior sergeant. Following the meeting Stransky discerns that his adjutant, Lieutenant Triebig, is a closeted homosexual which is a death penalty offence in the German Army.

The platoon celebrates the birthday of their leader, Lieutenant Meyer. Steiner takes the young Russian to the forward positions to release him, where he is accidentally killed by advancing Soviet troops in a major attack. The Germans are forced to defend their positions. Stransky is overcome by fear in his bunker while Meyer is killed leading a successful counterattack. Steiner is wounded and sent to a military hospital.

After his hospital stay, characterised by flashbacks and a romantic liaison with a nurse, played by Senta Berger, Steiner is offered a home leave but decides instead to return to his men. There he learns Stransky has been nominated for an Iron Cross for the counterattack Meyer had led. Stransky&#x27;s award requires two witnesses as confirmation. He blackmails Triebig and attempts to persuade Steiner to corroborate his claim with promises of preferential treatment after the war. Brandt questions Steiner in the hope that he will expose Stransky&#x27;s lies, but Steiner only states that he hates all officers, even those as &quot;enlightened&quot; as Brandt and Kiesel, and requests a few days to ponder his answer.

When his battalion is ordered to retreat, Stransky does not notify Steiner&#x27;s platoon. Making their way back through now-enemy territory, the men capture an all-female Russian detachment. While Steiner is busy, Zoll, a despised Nazi Party member, takes one of the women into the barn to rape her. She bites his genitals and he kills her. Meanwhile, young Dietz, left to guard the rest of the women alone, is distracted and killed as well. Disgusted, Steiner locks Zoll up with the vengeful Russian women, taking their uniforms to use as a disguise.

As the men near the German lines, they radio ahead to avoid friendly fire. Stransky suggests to Triebig that Steiner and his men be &quot;mistaken&quot; for Russians. Triebig orders his men to shoot the incoming Germans; only Steiner, Krüger and Anselm survive. Triebig denies responsibility, but Steiner kills him and makes Krüger the platoon leader, telling him to look after Anselm. Steiner then goes hunting for Stransky.

The Soviets launch a major assault. Brandt orders Kiesel to evacuate, telling him that men like him will be needed to rebuild Germany after the war. Brandt then rallies the fleeing troops for a counterattack.

Steiner locates Stransky. But instead of killing him, he hands him a weapon, and offers to show him &quot;where the Iron Crosses grow&quot;. Stransky accepts Steiner&#x27;s &quot;challenge&quot;, and they head off together for the battle. The film closes with Stransky trying to figure out how to reload his MP40, while being shot at by an adolescent Russian soldier who resembles the boy soldier released by Steiner. When Stransky asks Steiner for help, Steiner begins to laugh. His laughter continues through the credits, which feature &quot;Hänschen klein&quot; again and segues to black-and-white images of civilian victims from World War II and later conflicts.

==Production==
===Pre-production===
&quot;Cross of Iron&quot; was a joint Anglo-German production between EMI Films and ITC Entertainment of London and Rapid Films GmbH from Munich. Although the West German producer, Wolf C. Hartwig had secured a budget of $4 million, only a fraction of it was available as pre-production started. This created delays on location because local services and film crews demanded payment before commencing work.

In July 1975 EMI Films announced the film would be made as part of a slate of eleven films worth £6 million. The title was then &quot;Sergeant Steiner&quot; and the film would star Robert Shaw.

===Writing===
Screenplay credits are given to Julius Epstein, James Hamilton and Walter Kelley. Their source material was the 1956 novel &quot;The Willing Flesh&quot; by Willi Heinrich, a fictional work that was loosely based on the true story of Johann Schwerdfeger (1914-2015). The real-life Wehrmacht NCO was a highly decorated combat veteran who fought through both the Battle of the Caucasus and Kuban pocket.

===Filming===
Filming, which began on March 29, 1976, was shot on location at Trieste in Italy and Yugoslavia. Scenes were filmed around Obrov in Slovenia, and Zagreb and Savudrija in Croatia. Interiors were completed at Pinewood Studios in England.

The film is noted for featuring historically accurate weaponry and equipment such as Soviet T-34/85 tanks (which were obtained from the arsenal of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army), Russian PPSh-41s and German MG 42s and MP40s. According to star James Coburn, the Yugoslav government had promised that all the military equipment would be ready for the start of filming, but Hartwig&#x27;s lack of budget meant that considerable delays occurred when half the equipment was missing just as the production was about to begin.

Peckinpah&#x27;s alcoholism was also affecting the filming schedule because every day he was consuming 180° proof Slivovitz (&quot;Šljivovica&quot;). However every two to three weeks Peckinpah would go on a binge resulting in lost shooting days while he was allowed to regain his cognitive abilities.

Due to the various productions delays, the film had cost overruns of £2 million. With no more money, Hartwig and his co-producer Alex Winitsky tried to halt the production on July 6, 1976 (the 89th day of shooting) before the final scene had been filmed. The original ending was expected to take three days to film in an abandoned rail yard and special effects teams had already spent several days wiring pyrotechnics for the shoot. However, with the costs now at $6 million there was no more money. Coburn was so annoyed at this, he had Hartwig and Winitsky thrown off the set before making Peckinpah film a quick improvised ending for the film.

===Post production===
Peckinpah spent five weeks going through the rushes to create a final cut. Working continuously four to five hours a day overseeing the editing, he started snorting cocaine along with his drinking. He relied heavily on his experience with his 1969 Western &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; to create the film&#x27;s pace (the slow motion during violent scenes) and its visual style.

==Reception==
===Box office===
At the time of its release, the film performed poorly at the box office in the US and received mixed reviews. Its bleak, anti-war tone was unable to get noticed amidst the excitement surrounding the box-office hit &quot;Star Wars&quot;, released the same year. However, it performed very well in West Germany, with the best box-office earnings of any film released there since &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, and audiences and critics across Europe responded well to the film.
===Critical===
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;Mr. Peckinpah&#x27;s least interesting, least personal film in years ... I can&#x27;t believe that the director ever had his heart in this project, which, from the beginning, looks to have been prepared for the benefit of the people who set off explosives. However, the battle footage is so peculiarly cut into the narrative that you often don&#x27;t know who is doing what to whom.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; stated, &quot;&#x27;Cross of Iron&#x27; is Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s idea of an antiwar tract but which more than anything else affirms the director&#x27;s prowess as an action filmmaker of graphic mayhem ... the Wolf C. Hartwig production is well but conventionally cast, technically impressive, but ultimately violence-fixated to its putative philosophic cost.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 0.5 stars out of 4 and wrote, &quot;There are plenty of questions to be asked about &#x27;Cross of Iron,&#x27; Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s latest bloodbath picture. Questions such as, &#x27;Why was this film made?&#x27;&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Everything Peckinpah and his writers have to say about war in &#x27;Cross of Iron&#x27; has been better expressed by others and Peckinpah himself. Since &#x27;Cross of Iron&#x27; is too familiar to engage us intellectually, it becomes a wearying, numbing spectacle of carnage that tends to inure us to the violence it so graphically depicts.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a peculiarly pointless, expendable new action film,&quot; adding, &quot;If Peckinpah had something specific in mind when he began this project, an international co-production shot in Yugoslavia, he has lost the train of thought somewhere along the line.&quot; In the opinion of Filmcritic.com, &quot;Peckinpah indulges in endless combat scenes (this was his only war movie), which try the patience of viewers who came for the real story.&quot;

Fans of the film include Quentin Tarantino, who used it as inspiration for &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;. Orson Welles, when he saw the film, cabled Peckinpah, praising the latter&#x27;s film as &quot;the best war film he had seen about the ordinary enlisted man since &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;.&quot; Iain Johnstone, reviewing the film&#x27;s release on Blu-ray in June 2011, praised the film, saying &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; bears all the hallmarks of a real classic, which ranks with Peckinpah&#x27;s finest work. As a poignant reminder of the sheer brutal obscenity of war, it has rarely been equalled.&quot; Mike Mayo wrote in his book &quot;&quot;War Movies: Classic Conflict on Film&quot; that &quot;Cross of Iron&quot;, Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s only war film, &quot;is a forgotten masterpiece that has never really managed to overcome its troubled and expensive production.&quot; Jay Hyams wrote in &quot;War Movies&quot; that while Peckinpah had directed &quot;many films about battles between groups of armed men...this was the first in which both sides wear uniforms.&quot; Coburn said the film was one of his favorites of those he had been in. (The movie is generally considered one of the best of Coburn&#x27;s later movies.)

The film holds a score of 70% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 20 reviews.

==Sequel==
The film &quot;Breakthrough&quot;, which was mostly financed by West German producers, was released in 1979. It was made by Anglo-American director Andrew McLaglen who, like Peckinpah, was known for Westerns. Several changes were made to the sequel. For instance, the action was moved from Russia to the Western Front and Richard Burton replaced Coburn as Sgt Steiner. &quot;Breakthrough&quot; was panned by critics, who criticised it for a confusing plot, poor dialogue, aged cast, and undistinguished acting. The film involved Steiner saving the life of an American officer (Robert Mitchum) and a conspiracy to assassinate Adolf Hitler.

==Re-release==
To coincide with its release on Blu-ray, a new print of &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; was screened at selected cinemas in Britain in June 2011.
