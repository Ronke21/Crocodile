<text>U.S. Route 11 or U.S. Highway 11 (US 11) is a major north–south United States Numbered Highway extending across the eastern U.S. The southern terminus of the route is at US 90 in Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge in eastern New Orleans, Louisiana. The northern terminus is at the Rouses Point–Lacolle 223 Border Crossing in Rouses Point, New York. The route continues across the border into Canada as Route 223. US 11, created in 1926, maintains most of its original route. The route north of Knoxville, Tennessee, follows a route similar to Interstate 81 (I-81). While it is signed as a north–south route, it physically travels in a northeast–southwest direction.

Until 1929, US 11 ended just south of Picayune, Mississippi, at the Pearl River border with Louisiana. It was extended through Louisiana after that.

The Maestri Bridge, which carries US 11 across Lake Pontchartrain, served as the only route to New Orleans from the east for six weeks after Hurricane Katrina due to its sturdy construction. The storm virtually destroyed the I-10 Twin Span Bridge and damaged the Fort Pike Bridge on US 90.

I-81, constructed in the 1960s, parallels the route of US 11 in many areas. Beyond I-81&#x27;s southern terminus, other Interstates run along corridors paralleling US 11, specifically I-59, which is joined to I-81 by I-40, I-75, and I-24.

===Louisiana===
US 11 spans within the state of Louisiana. Its southern terminus is located in New Orleans East at a junction with US 90 (Chef Menteur Highway). The route begins as a two-lane highway that travels northward through a remote stretch of marshland within both the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge and the New Orleans city limits. After crossing over I-10 at exit 254, US 11 proceeds across Lake Pontchartrain on the Maestri Bridge, a span dating from 1928 that parallels the I-10 Twin Span Bridge. Midway across the lake, US 11 enters unincorporated St. Tammany Parish. Upon reaching the north shore, US 11 follows Pontchartrain Drive into the city of Slidell, where it becomes a busy four-lane commercial corridor.

After a brief concurrency with Louisiana Highway 433 (LA 433), US 11 turns onto Front Street and travels alongside the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) line through Slidell&#x27;s historic district. During this stretch, the route intersects both US 190 Business (Fremaux Avenue) and mainline US 190 (Gause Boulevard), both four-lane thoroughfares connecting with nearby I-10. Returning to two-lane capacity, US 11 crosses to the west side of the NS line on a narrow overpass built in 1937. At the north end of the city, US 11 intersects I-12 at exit 83, which is located just west of a major interchange with I-10 and I-59.

A few miles later, US 11 enters the town of Pearl River and intersects LA 41 (Watts Road). Here, the route turns southeast onto Concord Boulevard and proceeds a short distance to exit 3 on I-59. US 11 turns north onto I-59 and utilizes the four-lane Interstate alignment for the remainder of its distance in Louisiana. Following a second interchange serving the small town, I-59 and US 11 cross the West Pearl River into the dense Honey Island Swamp. Along this stretch is an exit connecting to Old US 11, a remnant of the pre-Interstate alignment that provides access to Pearl River Wildlife Management Area. US 11 crosses into the state of Mississippi with I-59 on a bridge spanning the main branch of the Pearl River just south of Nicholson, Mississippi.

===Mississippi===

US 11 runs for approximately in Mississippi. It enters the state along I-59, passing through several groves of trees. After a short distance, US 11 and I-59 interchange at exit 1 with Mississippi Highway 607 (MS 607), where MS 607 ends and US 11 takes over its northeastern alignment away from I-59. US 11 generally parallels I-59 across Mississippi, serving as a local business route and following city streets through communities such as Hattiesburg, Laurel, and Meridian, where I-59 begins a concurrency with I-20 eastbound. It leaves the state east of Meridian concurrent with US 80, entering the state of Alabama.

===Alabama===

US 11 spans in Alabama. It and US 80 split into Alabama near Cuba, with US 80 following an eastward track toward Demopolis. US 11, in contrast, continues to parallel the I-20/I-59 freeway through Livingston to Eutaw, where US 11 joins US 43. The overlapping routes proceed northeast to Tuscaloosa, where US 43 splits from US 11 and heads north. US 11, however, continues along the I-20/I-59 corridor to Birmingham. US 11 overlaps I-20/59 for approximately between Woodstock and Bessemer. From Bessemer into Birmingham, the route is locally known as the &quot;Bessemer Superhighway&quot;. US 11 is cosigned with State Route 5 (SR 5) between Woodstock and Birmingham. US 11 through the western side of Birmingham is known as the Bessemer Superhighway and 3rd Avenue West. It passes near the Alabama State Fairgrounds, Rickwood Field (one of the oldest baseball stadiums in the U.S.), and Legion Field (known for hosting football games). On the east side of Birmingham, US 11 is known locally as 1st Avenue North and as Roebuck Parkway.

West of downtown Birmingham, US 11 intersects US 78. US 78 turns east onto US 11, forming an overlap as the roadway enters the heart of the city. In the midst of the city center, US 78 breaks from US 11, progressing south of US 11 as the two routes exit the city. East of downtown, I-20 splits from I-59, with US 11 following I-59 to the northeast. US 11 passes through Gadsden and Fort Payne before crossing into Georgia northeast of Hammondville.

Throughout Alabama, US 11 is paired with unsigned State Route 7 (SR 7).

Until 1955, US 11 was routed to Ashville and Gadsden following the current routes of SR 23 and US 411 and followed Third Street and went west on Forrest Avenue in downtown Gadsden. It was relocated to its present route to Attalla, with the original route designated as an alternate route until 1963.

The routes that corresponds to US 11&#x27;s route in Alabama includes the Bear Meat Cabin Road (Huntsville Road), the Rome and Tuscaloosa Road (also called &quot;Georgia Road&quot;) from Birmingham, and the Chattanooga Road (also called Alabama Road) from Attalla.

===Georgia===
After entering the state from Alabama, US 11 and State Route 58 (SR 58) travel northeast, parallel to I-59, through the valley between Sand and Lookout mountains. The routes travel through the county seat of Dade County, Trenton, where they are briefly concurrent with SR 136. In the community of Wildwood, US 11 and SR 58 intersect the eastern terminus of SR 299 before continuing north into Tennessee. US 11 extends within the state&#x27;s borders.

US 11 and SR 58 see an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 5,000 vehicles or more north of Trenton. However, most of the route&#x27;s through traffic has been diverted to I-59, which closely parallels the route not only in Georgia but also in Alabama and Mississippi.

===Tennessee===
US 11 enters Tennessee west of Chattanooga. The route, concurrent with State Route 38 (SR 38) from the state line north, runs parallel to I-24 for to an intersection with Cummings Highway (US 41/US 64/US 72/SR 2). While SR 38 terminates here, US 11 follows the highway east into downtown Chattanooga. At the intersection of Broad Street and East 23rd Street, US 11 and US 64 separate from US 41 and US 72 and follow East 23rd east through downtown. The routes briefly overlap with US 41, here concurrent to US 76, on Dodds Avenue before resuming an easterly progression on Brainerd Road thereafter called Lee Highway. The road is also called Lee Highway in southwestern Virginia.

East of downtown, I-24 terminates while I-75 continues east along the I-24 right-of-way. US 11 and US 64 continue to the northeast, paralleling I-75 to Cleveland. In Downtown Cleveland, US 64 separates from US 11, following US 74 east out of the city.

US 11 remains close to I-75 as it heads north, passing through Athens, Sweetwater, Loudon, and Lenoir City before entering Farragut. On the western edge of town, US 11 merges with US 70 at Dixie Lee Junction to form Kingston Pike. The routes remain joined for just over as they pass through Farragut and West Knoxville before diverging again in Downtown Knoxville.

In East Knoxville, US 11 splits into US 11W and US 11E, with US 70 following US 11E.

===U.S. Route 11E===

Traversing from Knoxville, Tennessee, to Bristol, Virginia, US 11E connects the cities and towns of New Market, Jefferson City, Morristown, Greeneville, Tusculum, Jonesborough, Johnson City, Bluff City, and Bristol, all in Tennessee. After crossing into Virginia, it reconnects with US 11W.

===U.S. Route 11W===

Traversing from Knoxville, Tennessee, to Bristol, Virginia, US 11W connects the cities and towns of Blaine, Rutledge, Bean Station, Rogersville, Surgoinsville, Church Hill, Mount Carmel, and Kingsport, all in Tennessee. After crossing into Virginia, it reconnects with US 11E.

===Virginia===
US 11W and US 11E rejoin as US 11 in Bristol less than a mile north of the Tennessee–Virginia state line. As Lee Highway, US 11 proceeds northeastward through Abingdon, Wytheville, and Radford. In this area, I-81 was constructed parallel to US 11.

At Christiansburg, US 11 joins US 460 and the two routes overlap for to Salem, where the two highways split. US 11 winds through Roanoke on several roads, sometimes opposite the signed direction.

Part of the Carolina Road, a colonial trail, follows the roadbed of US 11, also known as the Lee Highway, through Virginia. Near Cloverdale is the historical marker: &quot;This is the old road from Pennsylvania to the Yadkin Valley, over which in early times settlers passed going south. On it were the Black Horse Tavern and the Tinker Creek Presbyterian Church.&quot;

From Roanoke, the highway continues through Buchanan, Lexington, Staunton, Harrisonburg, and Winchester in the Shenandoah Valley. (Between Buchanan and Lexington, US 11 passes over famed Natural Bridge). I-81 was constructed parallel to US 11 through many of these cities, although it generally bypassed the smaller towns. US 11 enters West Virginia about northeast of Winchester. Through the Great Appalachian Valley, US 11 follows much of former Valley Pike, a former colonial trace and important roadway during the Civil War.

===West Virginia===

US 11 enters West Virginia less than southeast of I-81. US 11 heads northeast for about through Berkeley County, passing through Inwood, Martinsburg, and Falling Waters before crossing the Potomac River into Maryland. The road is known as Winchester Avenue south of Martinsburg and as Williamsport Pike north of the city.

===Maryland===

In Maryland, US 11 passes over the Potomac River into Williamsport and through Hagerstown in Washington County before crossing the Mason–Dixon line into Pennsylvania. I-81 was constructed along much the same route in the 1960s.

===Pennsylvania===
US 11 and I-81 enter Pennsylvania south of Greencastle. Known as the Molly Pitcher highway, US 11 follows I-81 northeast through the Cumberland Valley, running parallel to each other as they pass through Chambersburg, Shippensburg, and Carlisle. Northeast of Carlisle in Middlesex Township, US 11 interchanges with the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76) and I-81 in succession. US 11, now to the south of I-81, continues eastward into the western suburbs of Harrisburg as the Carlisle Pike.

In Camp Hill, a close suburb of Harrisburg, US 11 stops paralleling I-81 and joins US 15 northward through the western suburbs of Harrisburg. As the road exits the Harrisburg area, US 11 and US 15 begin to parallel the Susquehanna River as both head northward. The two routes remain overlapped to an intersection in Shamokin Dam, where US 15 branches off to the northwest, following the path of the West Branch Susquehanna River northward. US 11, in contrast, continues to parallel the main Susquehanna River, passing through municipalities such as Danville, Bloomsburg, and Berwick prior to reaching Wilkes-Barre.

In Wilkes-Barre, US 11 breaks from the Susquehanna and begins to run parallel to I-81 once more. From Wilkes-Barre, the highway goes through nearby Scranton, becoming the North Scranton Expressway north of downtown. In Clarks Summit, just north of Scranton, US 11 intersects US 6. US 6 joins US 11 westward to Factoryville, where US 11 separates from US 6 and resumes its northerly trek through Susquehanna County to the New York–Pennsylvania border.

===New York===
US 11 proceeds northwestward through New York from the Pennsylvania border to Binghamton. US 11 and I-81 continue to parallel each other as they head north through Cortland and Syracuse. The route continues northward to Watertown. US 11 heads northeast from Watertown, passing along the northern edge of Fort Drum and traversing a number of towns and villages, including Canton and Potsdam. US 11 passes north of the Adirondack Park passing through Malone. At Rouses Point, US 11 joins New York State Route 9B and heads north to the Rouses Point–Lacolle 223 Border Crossing, becoming Route 223.

<doc id="456566" wikidata="Q649513" url="?curid=456566" title="Spinner dolphin">
<text>The spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) is a small dolphin found in off-shore tropical waters around the world. It is famous for its acrobatic displays in which it rotates around its longitudinal axis as it leaps through the air. It is a member of the family Delphinidae of toothed whales.

==Taxonomy==
The spinner dolphin is sometimes referred to as the long-snouted dolphin, particularly in older texts, to distinguish it from the similar Clymene dolphin, which is often called the short-snouted spinner dolphin. The species was described by John Gray in 1828. The four named subspecies are:

*Eastern spinner dolphin (&quot;S. l. orientalis&quot;), from the tropical eastern Pacific.
*Central American or Costa Rican spinner dolphin (&quot;S. l. centroamericana&quot;), also found in the tropical eastern Pacific.
*Gray&#x27;s or Hawaiian spinner dolphin (&quot;S. l. longirostris&quot;), from the central Pacific Ocean around Hawaii but represents a mixture of broadly similar subtypes found worldwide.
*Dwarf spinner dolphin (&quot;S. l. roseiventris&quot;), first found in the Gulf of Thailand.

The species, though, displays greater variety than these subspecies might indicate. A hybrid form characterized by its white belly inhabits the eastern Pacific. Other less distinct groupings inhabit other oceans.

The species name comes from the Latin word for &quot;long-beaked.&quot;

==Description==
Spinner dolphins are small cetaceans with a slim build. Adults are typically 129–235 cm long and reach a body mass of 23–79 kg. This species has an elongated rostrum and a triangular or subtriangular dorsal fin. Spinner dolphins generally have tripartite color patterns. The dorsal area is dark gray, the sides light gray, and the underside pale gray or white. Also, a dark band runs from the eye to the flipper, bordered above by a thin, light line. However, the spinner dolphin has more geographic variation in form and coloration than other cetaceans. In the open waters of eastern Pacific, dolphins have relatively small skulls with short rostra. A dwarf form of spinner dolphin occurs around Southeast Asia. In these same subspecies, a dark dorsal cape dims their tripartite color patterns. Further offshore, subspecies tend to have a paler and less far-reaching cape. In certain subspecies, some males may have upright fins that slant forward. Some populations of spinner dolphin found in the eastern Pacific have backwards-facing dorsal fins, and males can have dorsal humps and upturned caudal flukes.

==Ecology==
The spinner dolphin lives in nearly all tropical and subtropical waters between 40°N and 40°S. The species primarily inhabits coastal waters, islands, or banks. However, in the eastern tropical Pacific, spinner dolphins live far from shore. Spinner dolphins may use different habitats depending on the season.

The spinner dolphin feeds mainly on small mesopelagic fish, squids, and sergestid shrimps, and will dive 200–300 m to feed on them. Spinner dolphins of Hawaii are nocturnal feeders and forage in deep scattering layers, which contain many species. The dwarf spinner dolphin may feed mostly on benthic fish in reefs and shallow water. Off Oahu, Hawaii, spinner dolphins forage at night and cooperatively herd their prey into highly dense patches. They swim around the prey in a circle and a pair may swim through the circle to make a catch. Spinner dolphins are in turn preyed on by sharks. Other possible predators include the killer whale, the false killer whale, the pygmy killer whale and the short-finned pilot whale. They are susceptible to parasites, and are known to exhibit both external ones like barnacles and remoras, and internal ones, like nematodes, trematodes, cestodes and acanthocephalans.

==Behavior and life history==

Due to the spinner dolphin foraging and feeding at night, in certain regions, such as Hawaii and northern Brazil, dolphins spend the daytime resting in shallow bays near deep water. Spinner dolphins rest as a single unit, moving back and forth slowly in a tight formation but just out of contact with one another. These resting behaviors are observed for about four to five hours daily. During rest periods, spinner dolphins rely on vision rather than echolocation. At dusk, they travel offshore to feed. They travel along the shore during foraging trips, and the individuals that occupy the same bay may change daily. Some individual dolphins do not always go to a bay to rest; however, in Hawaii, dolphins do seem to return to the same site each trip.

Spinner dolphins live in an open and loose social organization. The spinner dolphins of Hawaii live in family groups, but also have associations with others beyond their groups. Mothers and calves form strong social bonds. Spinner dolphins seem to have a promiscuous mating system, with individuals changing partners for up to some weeks. A dozen adult males may gather into coalitions. Vocalizations of spinner dolphins include whistles, which may be used to organize the school, burst-pulse signals, and echolocation clicks. The spinner dolphin has a 10-month gestation period, and mothers nurse their young for one to two years. Females are sexually mature at four to seven years, with three-year calving intervals, while males are sexually mature at seven to 10 years. Spinner dolphins live for about 20-25 years. Breeding is seasonal, more so in certain regions than others.

Although most spinner dolphins are found in the deeper waters offshore of the islands, the rest of the Hawaiʻi population has a more coastal distribution. During daytime hours, the island-associated stocks of Hawaiian spinner dolphins seek sanctuary in nearshore waters, where they return to certain areas to socialize, rest, and nurture their young.

===Spinning behavior===
Spinner dolphins are known for their acrobatics and aerial behaviors. A spinner dolphin comes out of the water front first and twists its body as it rises into the air. When it reaches its maximum height, the dolphin descends back into the water, landing on its side. A dolphin can make two to seven spins in one leap; the swimming and rotational speed of the dolphin as it spins underwater affects the number of spins it can do while airborne. These spins may serve several functions. Some of these functions are believed by experts to be acoustic signaling or communication. Another reason is to remove ectoparasites such as remoras. Dolphins may also make nose-outs, tail slaps, flips, head slaps, &quot;salmon leaps&quot;, and side and back slaps.

==Conservation status==
The protected status of spinner dolphins are CITES Appendix II and Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) protected throughout its range as well as MMPA depleted in its eastern stock. Tens of thousands of spinner dolphins, mostly eastern and white-bellied varieties, were killed in the 30 years after purse seine fishing for tuna began in the 1950s. The process killed probably half of all eastern spinner dolphins. They have also been contaminated by pollutants such as DDT and PCBs. Spinner dolphins, as with other species affected by ETP tuna purse-seine fishing, are managed nationally by the coastal countries and internationally by the IATTC. The IATTC has imposed annual stock mortality limits on each purse seine and promulgated regulations regarding the safe release of dolphins.

The eastern tropical Pacific and Southeast Asian populations of the spinner dolphin are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), since they have an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organized by tailored agreements.

In addition, the spinner dolphin is covered by Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU). Spinner dolphins are susceptible to disease and two of the recorded diseases within them are toxoplasmosis and cetacean morbillivirus. The number of cases reported however is fairly low in the species.

Spinner dolphins in Hawaii receive multiple daily visits to their near-shore resting grounds, with boats taking people out daily to snorkel and interact with the local dolphin population. Such activities are increasingly coming under criticism on the grounds of possible harm to the dolphins, and efforts are being made both to educate the public in order to minimise human impact on the dolphins, and to bring in regulations to govern these activities.

In 2023, 33 swimmers were arrested for reportedly harassing dolphins off the coast of the Big Island of Hawaii. The swimmers reportedly broke federal law by swimming within 45 meters (50 yards) of the dolphins. The ban went into effect in 2021 due to dolphins not getting enough rest during the day to forage for food at night. The swimmers were caught by drone footage pursuing the dolphins as they tried to escape.

<text>Branch and bound (BB, B&amp;B, or BnB) is a method for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems and using a bounding function to eliminate sub-problems that cannot contain the optimal solution. It is an algorithm design paradigm for discrete and combinatorial optimization problems, as well as mathematical optimization. A branch-and-bound algorithm consists of a systematic enumeration of candidate solutions by means of state space search: the set of candidate solutions is thought of as forming a rooted tree with the full set at the root. The algorithm explores &quot;branches&quot; of this tree, which represent subsets of the solution set. Before enumerating the candidate solutions of a branch, the branch is checked against upper and lower estimated &quot;bounds&quot; on the optimal solution, and is discarded if it cannot produce a better solution than the best one found so far by the algorithm.

The algorithm depends on efficient estimation of the lower and upper bounds of regions/branches of the search space. If no bounds are available, the algorithm degenerates to an exhaustive search.

The method was first proposed by Ailsa Land and Alison Doig whilst carrying out research at the London School of Economics sponsored by British Petroleum in 1960 for discrete programming, and has become the most commonly used tool for solving NP-hard optimization problems. The name &quot;branch and bound&quot; first occurred in the work of Little &quot;et al.&quot; on the traveling salesman problem.

==Overview==
The goal of a branch-and-bound algorithm is to find a value that maximizes or minimizes the value of a real-valued function , called an objective function, among some set of admissible, or candidate solutions. The set is called the search space, or feasible region. The rest of this section assumes that minimization of is desired; this assumption comes without loss of generality, since one can find the maximum value of by finding the minimum of . A B&amp;B algorithm operates according to two principles:

* It recursively splits the search space into smaller spaces, then minimizing on these smaller spaces; the splitting is called &quot;branching&quot;.
* Branching alone would amount to brute-force enumeration of candidate solutions and testing them all. To improve on the performance of brute-force search, a B&amp;B algorithm keeps track of &quot;bounds&quot; on the minimum that it is trying to find, and uses these bounds to &quot;prune&quot; the search space, eliminating candidate solutions that it can prove will not contain an optimal solution.

Turning these principles into a concrete algorithm for a specific optimization problem requires some kind of data structure that represents sets of candidate solutions. Such a representation is called an &quot;instance&quot; of the problem. Denote the set of candidate solutions of an instance by . The instance representation has to come with three operations:

* produces two or more instances that each represent a subset of . (Typically, the subsets are disjoint to prevent the algorithm from visiting the same candidate solution twice, but this is not required. However, an optimal solution among must be contained in at least one of the subsets.)
* computes a lower bound on the value of any candidate solution in the space represented by , that is, for all in .
* determines whether represents a single candidate solution. (Optionally, if it does not, the operation may choose to return some feasible solution from among .) If returns a solution then provides an upper bound for the optimal objective value over the whole space of feasible solutions.
Using these operations, a B&amp;B algorithm performs a top-down recursive search through the tree of instances formed by the branch operation. Upon visiting an instance , it checks whether is equal or greater than the current upper bound; if so, may be safely discarded from the search and the recursion stops. This pruning step is usually implemented by maintaining a global variable that records the minimum upper bound seen among all instances examined so far.

===Generic version===
The following is the skeleton of a generic branch and bound algorithm for minimizing an arbitrary objective function . To obtain an actual algorithm from this, one requires a bounding function , that computes lower bounds of on nodes of the search tree, as well as a problem-specific branching rule. As such, the generic algorithm presented here is a higher-order function.

# Using a heuristic, find a solution to the optimization problem. Store its value, . (If no heuristic is available, set to infinity.) will denote the best solution found so far, and will be used as an upper bound on candidate solutions.
# Initialize a queue to hold a partial solution with none of the variables of the problem assigned.
# Loop until the queue is empty:
## Take a node off the queue.
## If represents a single candidate solution and , then is the best solution so far. Record it and set .
## Else, &quot;branch&quot; on to produce new nodes . For each of these:
### If , do nothing; since the lower bound on this node is greater than the upper bound of the problem, it will never lead to the optimal solution, and can be discarded.
### Else, store on the queue.

Several different queue data structures can be used. This FIFO queue-based implementation yields a breadth-first search. A stack (LIFO queue) will yield a depth-first algorithm. A best-first branch and bound algorithm can be obtained by using a priority queue that sorts nodes on their lower bound. Examples of best-first search algorithms with this premise are Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm and its descendant A* search. The depth-first variant is recommended when no good heuristic is available for producing an initial solution, because it quickly produces full solutions, and therefore upper bounds.

==== Pseudocode ====
A C++-like pseudocode implementation of the above is:

// C++-like implementation of branch and bound, 
// assuming the objective function f is to be minimized
CombinatorialSolution branch_and_bound_solve(
 CombinatorialProblem problem, 
 ObjectiveFunction objective_function /*f*/,
 BoundingFunction lower_bound_function /*bound*/) 
 // Step 1 above.
 double problem_upper_bound = std::numeric_limits&lt;double&gt;::infinity; // = B
 CombinatorialSolution heuristic_solution = heuristic_solve(problem); // x_h
 problem_upper_bound = objective_function(heuristic_solution); // B = f(x_h)
 CombinatorialSolution current_optimum = heuristic_solution;
 // Step 2 above
 queue&lt;CandidateSolutionTree&gt; candidate_queue;
 // problem-specific queue initialization
 candidate_queue = populate_candidates(problem);
 while (!candidate_queue.empty()) { // Step 3 above
 // Step 3.1
 CandidateSolutionTree node = candidate_queue.pop();
 // &quot;node&quot; represents N above
 if (node.represents_single_candidate()) { // Step 3.2
 if (objective_function(node.candidate()) &lt; problem_upper_bound) {
 current_optimum = node.candidate();
 problem_upper_bound = objective_function(current_optimum);
 // else, node is a single candidate which is not optimum
 else { // Step 3.3: node represents a branch of candidate solutions
 // &quot;child_branch&quot; represents N_i above
 for (auto&amp;&amp; child_branch : node.candidate_nodes) {
 if (lower_bound_function(child_branch) &lt;= problem_upper_bound) {
 candidate_queue.enqueue(child_branch); // Step 3.3.2
 // otherwise, bound(N_i) &gt; B so we prune the branch; step 3.3.1
 }
 return current_optimum;


In the above pseudocode, the functions codice_1 and codice_2 called as subroutines must be provided as applicable to the problem. The functions (codice_3) and (codice_4) are treated as function objects as written, and could correspond to lambda expressions, function pointers and other types of callable objects in the C++ programming language.

===Improvements===
When formula_1 is a vector of formula_2, branch and bound algorithms can be combined with interval analysis and contractor techniques in order to provide guaranteed enclosures of the global minimum.

== Applications ==

This approach is used for a number of NP-hard problems:
* Integer programming
* Nonlinear programming
* Travelling salesman problem (TSP)
* Quadratic assignment problem (QAP)
* Maximum satisfiability problem (MAX-SAT)
* Nearest neighbor search (by Keinosuke Fukunaga)
* Flow shop scheduling
* Cutting stock problem
* Computational phylogenetics
* Set inversion
* Parameter estimation
* 0/1 knapsack problem
* Set cover problem
* Feature selection in machine learning
* Structured prediction in computer vision
* Arc routing problem, including Chinese Postman problem
* Talent Scheduling, scenes shooting arrangement problem

Branch-and-bound may also be a base of various heuristics. For example, one may wish to stop branching when the gap between the upper and lower bounds becomes smaller than a certain threshold. This is used when the solution is &quot;good enough for practical purposes&quot; and can greatly reduce the computations required. This type of solution is particularly applicable when the cost function used is &quot;noisy&quot; or is the result of statistical estimates and so is not known precisely but rather only known to lie within a range of values with a specific probability.

==Relation to other algorithms==
Nau &quot;et al.&quot; present a generalization of branch and bound that also subsumes the A*, B* and alpha-beta search algorithms.

== Optimization Example ==
Branch and bound can be used to solve this problem

Maximize formula_3 with these constraints

formula_4

formula_5

formula_6

formula_7 and formula_8 are integers. 

The first step is to relax the integer constraint. We have two extreme points for the first equation that form a line: formula_9 and formula_10. We can form the second line with the vector points formula_11 and formula_12. 

The third point is formula_13. This is a convex hull region so the solution lies on one of the vertices of the region. We can find the intersection using row reduction, which is formula_14, or formula_15 with a value of 276.667. We test the other endpoints by sweeping the line over the region and find this is the maximum over the reals. 

We choose the variable with the maximum fractional part, in this case formula_8 becomes the parameter for the branch and bound method. We branch to formula_17 and obtain 276 @ formula_18. We have reached an integer solution so we move to the other branch formula_19. We obtain 275.75 @formula_20. We have a decimal so we branch formula_7 to formula_22 and we find 274.571 @formula_23. We try the other branch formula_24 and there are no feasible solutions. Therefore, the maximum is 276 with formula_25 and formula_26.

<text>Music in Moldova is closely related to that of its neighbour and cultural kin, Romania. Moldovan folk is known for swift, complex rhythms (a characteristic shared with many Eastern European traditions), musical improvisation, syncopation and much melodic ornamentation. Pop, hip hop, rock and other modern genres have their own fans in Moldova as well. Modern pop stars include O-Zone, a Moldovan band whose &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; was a major 2004 European hit, guitarist and songwriter Vladimir Pogrebniuc, Natalia Barbu, who is well known in Germany, Romania and Ukraine, and Nelly Ciobanu. The band Flacai became well known in the 1970s across Moldova, turning their hometown of Cahul into an important center of music.

==Folk music==
During the Soviet era, Moldovan folk culture flourished, and was strongly promoted by the government. However, many elements were altered to obscure the shared history of Romania and Moldova, because the Soviet Union wanted to discourage secession.

The &quot;Mioriţa&quot; is ancient ballad that is a very important part of Moldovan folk culture.

Moldova&#x27;s folk music and dance companies, troupes and orchestras are well known, especially Joc, an academic dance company; a &quot;joc&quot; is a celebration that includes dances, as well as the part of a town where the dancing takes place.

The Orchestra of Moldovan Folk Music and Dance was founded in 1949; the orchestra plays Romanian, Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, German music.

Music festivals in Moldova include The Faces of Friends, held in the town of Cahul; this festival was founded in 1996.

<doc id="456587" wikidata="Q747551" url="?curid=456587" title="Videodrome">
<text>Videodrome is a 1983 Canadian science fiction body horror film written and directed by David Cronenberg and starring James Woods, Sonja Smits, and Debbie Harry. Set in Toronto during the early 1980s, it follows the CEO of a small UHF television station who stumbles upon a broadcast signal of snuff films. Layers of deception and mind-control conspiracy unfold as he attempts to uncover the signal&#x27;s source, complicated by increasingly intense hallucinations that cause him to lose his grip on reality.

Distributed by Universal Pictures, &quot;Videodrome&quot; was the first film by Cronenberg to gain backing from any major Hollywood studio. With the highest budget of any of his films to date, the film was a box-office bomb, recouping only $2.1 million from a $5.9 million budget. The film received praise for the special makeup effects, Cronenberg&#x27;s direction, Woods and Harry&#x27;s performances, its &quot;techno-surrealist&quot; aesthetic, and its cryptic, psychosexual themes. Cronenberg won the Best Direction award and was nominated for seven other awards at the 5th Genie Awards.

Now considered a cult classic, the film has been cited as one of Cronenberg&#x27;s best, and a key example of the body horror and science fiction horror genres.
==Plot==
Max Renn is the president of CIVIC-TV, a Toronto UHF television station specializing in sensationalist programming. Harlan, the operator of CIVIC-TV&#x27;s unauthorized satellite dish, shows Max &quot;Videodrome&quot;. Purportedly broadcast from Malaysia, it is a plotless show depicting victims being violently tortured and eventually murdered. Believing this to be the future of television, Max orders Harlan to begin unlicensed use of the show.

Nicki Brand, a sadomasochistic radio host who becomes sexually involved with Max, is aroused by an episode of &quot;Videodrome&quot;. Upon learning it is actually broadcast out of Pittsburgh, she goes to audition for the show but never returns. Max contacts Masha, a softcore pornographer, and asks her to help him investigate &quot;Videodrome&quot;. Through Masha, Max learns that the footage is real and is the public &quot;face&quot; of a political movement. Masha further informs him that the enigmatic media theorist Brian O&#x27;Blivion knows about &quot;Videodrome&quot;.

Max tracks down O&#x27;Blivion to a homeless shelter where vagrants engage in marathon sessions of television viewing. He discovers that O&#x27;Blivion&#x27;s daughter Bianca runs the mission, aiding her father&#x27;s vision of a world where television replaces everyday life. Later, Max views a videotape of O&#x27;Blivion explaining that &quot;Videodrome&quot; is a socio-political battleground in which a war is being fought to control the minds of the people of North America. Max then hallucinates that Nicki speaks directly to him and causes his television to undulate as he kisses the screen. Disturbed, Max returns to O&#x27;Blivion&#x27;s homeless shelter. Bianca tells him that &quot;Videodrome&quot; carries a broadcast signal that gives malignant brain tumors. O&#x27;Blivion considers it as part of his vision, and hallucinations are a higher form of reality. When O&#x27;Blivion found out it was to be used for malevolent purposes, he attempted to stop his partners only to be killed by his own invention. In the year before his death, O&#x27;Blivion recorded thousands of videos, which now form the basis of his television appearances.

Later that night, Max hallucinates placing his handgun in a slit in his abdomen. He is contacted by &quot;Videodrome&quot;s producer, Barry Convex of the Spectacular Optical Corporation, an eyeglasses company that acts as a front for an arms company, who uses a device to record Max&#x27;s fantasies. Max then wakes up to find Masha&#x27;s corpse in his bed. He frantically calls Harlan to photograph the body as evidence, but, shortly after he arrives, her body is gone.

Wanting to see the latest Videodrome broadcast, Max meets Harlan at his studio. Harlan reveals that he has been working with Convex to recruit Max to their cause. They aim to end North America&#x27;s cultural decay by using &quot;Videodrome&quot; to kill anyone too obsessed with sex and violence. Convex then inserts a brainwashing Betamax tape into Max&#x27;s torso. Under Convex&#x27;s influence, Max kills his colleagues at CIVIC-TV. He attempts to kill Bianca, who stops him by showing him a videotape of Nicki&#x27;s murder on the Videodrome set. Bianca then &quot;reprograms&quot; Max to her father&#x27;s cause: &quot;Death to &quot;Videodrome&quot;. Long live the new flesh.&quot; On her orders, he kills Harlan, whose hand transforms into a stielhandgranate after he inserts it into Max&#x27;s torso slit and explodes, and Convex, whose body erupts into massive tumors and tears itself apart after Max shoots him with a gun fused to his hand.

Now wanted for murder, Max takes refuge on a derelict boat in the Port Lands. Appearing to him on television, Nicki tells him he has weakened &quot;Videodrome&quot;, but to defeat it, he must &quot;leave the old flesh&quot; and ascend to the next level. The television shows an image of Max shooting himself in the head, which causes the set to explode. Reenacting what he has just seen, Max utters the words &quot;Long live the new flesh&quot; and shoots himself.

===Development===
The basis for &quot;Videodrome&quot; came from David Cronenberg&#x27;s childhood. Cronenberg used to pick up American television signals from Buffalo, New York, late at night after Canadian stations had gone off the air, and worry he might see something disturbing not meant for public consumption. As Cronenberg explained, &quot;I&#x27;ve always been interested in dark things and other people&#x27;s fascinations with dark things. Plus, the idea of people locking themselves in a room and turning a key on a television set so that they can watch something extremely dark, and by doing that, allowing themselves to explore their fascinations.&quot; Cronenberg watched Marshall McLuhan, on whom O&#x27;Blivion was based, and McLuhan later taught at the University of Toronto while Cronenberg was a student there, although he never took any of McLuhan&#x27;s classes.

Cronenberg&#x27;s first exploration of themes of the branding of sex and violence and media impacting people&#x27;s reality was writing a treatment titled &quot;Network of Blood&quot; in the early 1970s; its premise was a worker for an independent television company (who would become Max Renn in &quot;Videodrome&quot;) unintentionally finding, in the filmmaker&#x27;s words, &quot;a private television network subscribed to by strange, wealthy people who were willing to pay to see bizarre things.&quot; He later planned the story to be told from the main character&#x27;s first-person perspective, showcasing a duality between how insane he looks to other people and how he himself perceives a different reality in his head. Concepts similar to &quot;Network of Blood&quot;″s were further explored in a 1977 episode of the CBC Television series &quot;Peep Show&quot; Cronenberg directed, named &quot;The Victim.&quot; The film&#x27;s fictional station CIVIC-TV was modeled on the real-life Toronto television station CITY-TV, which was known for broadcasting pornographic content and violent films in its late-night programming bloc &quot;The Baby Blue Movie&quot;.

Victor Snolicki, Dick Schouten, and Pierre David of Vision 4, a company taking advantage of Canada&#x27;s tax shelter policies, aided Cronenberg in the film&#x27;s financing. Vision 4 dissolved after Schouten&#x27;s death and reorganized into Filmplan International which funded &quot;Scanners&quot;. Solnicki, David, and Claude Héroux formed Filmplan II which gave financial backing to &quot;Videodrome&quot;. This was the last film Cronenberg made under Canada&#x27;s film tax shelter policy.

Cronenberg&#x27;s increased reputation made it easier for his projects to get produced, leading to the film&#x27;s $5.5 million budget, more interest from studios and producers, and a larger number of interested actors to choose from. After the box office success of &quot;Scanners&quot;, Cronenberg turned down the chance of directing &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, having had no desire to direct material produced by other filmmakers. Cronenberg met with David in Montreal to discuss ideas for a new film, with the former pitching two ideas, one of them being &quot;Videodrome&quot;.

Cronenberg started writing the first draft of &quot;Videodrome&quot; in January 1981, and, as with first drafts of Cronenberg&#x27;s prior projects, included many parts not featured in the final cut to make it more acceptable for audiences; this included Renn having an explosive grenade as a hand after he chops off his flesh gun during a hallucination, Renn and Nicki melting, via a kiss, into an object that then melts an on-looker, and five other characters besides Barry also dying of cancer. Cronenberg admits that he was worried that the project would be rejected by Filmplan due to the excessive violent content of an early draft, but it was approved, with Claude Héroux joking that the movie would get a triple X rating. Although talent for the film was attracted using the first draft, alterations were made constantly from pre-production to post-production.

Accumulation of the cast and crew started in the summer of 1981 in Toronto, with most of the supporting actors being local performers of the city. &quot;Videodrome&quot;″s three producers, David, Claude Héroux and Victor Solnicki, suggested James Woods for the role of Max Renn; they unsuccessfully tried to attach him to another film they produced, &quot;Models&quot; (1982). Woods was a fan of &quot;Rabid&quot; (1977) and &quot;Scanners&quot;, and met Cronenberg in Beverly Hills for the part; Cronenberg liked the fact that Woods was very articulate in terms of delivery, and Woods appreciated the filmmaker&#x27;s oddball style as well as being a &quot;good controversialist&quot; with &quot;a lot of power.&quot; Cronenberg doubled for Woods in the scene where Max puts on the Videodrome helmet since the actor was afraid of getting electrocuted. Co-star Debbie Harry was recommended by David, and Cronenberg cast her after viewing her two times in &quot;Union City&quot; (1980) and a Toronto audition. She had never had such a large part before, and said that the more experienced Woods gave her a number of helpful suggestions.

===Filming===
The film was shot in Toronto from October 27 to December 23, 1981, on a budget of $5,952,000 (), with the financing equally coming from Canada and the United States. 50% of the film&#x27;s budget came from Universal. The initial week of filming being devoted to videotaping various monitor inserts. These included the television monologues of Professor Brian O&#x27;Blivion, as well as the &quot;Videodrome&quot; torture scenes and the soft-core pornographic programs &quot;Samurai Dreams&quot; and &quot;Apollo &amp; Dionysus&quot;. The video camera used for the monitor scenes was a Hitachi SK-91. The film&#x27;s cinematography was handled by Mark Irwin, who was very uncomfortable with doing the monitor scenes; he was far more experienced with composing shots for regular film cameras than videotapes, disliked the flat television standards of lighting and color, and couldn&#x27;t compose his shots privately as all of the film crew watched the monitors as the shots were being set up. Cronenberg stated that &quot;Videodrome&quot; was the first time that he fired a crew worker due to an incident between a hairdresser and Harry.

The &quot;Samurai Dreams&quot; short was filmed in half a day without any audio recorded at a rented spot at a Global TV studio in Toronto, and lasted five minutes longer than what ended up in the final film.

Three different endings were filmed. The ending used in the final film, wherein Max shoots himself on the derelict ship, was James Woods&#x27; idea. One of the initial intentions for the ending was to include an epilogue after the suicide, wherein Max, Bianca, and Nicki appear on the set of &quot;Videodrome&quot;. Bianca and Nicki are shown to have chest slits like Max, from which grotesque, mutated sex organs emerge. Another ending featured an orgy between Bianca, Max, and Nicki after Max shoots himself and sex-organs were designed for the scene, but Cronenberg decided to remove the scene.

===Effects===
Rick Baker, who worked on the effects of &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;, did the effects for the film. However, his desired six months of preparation was reduced to two months and less effects were created due to a reduced budget.

One of the scenes cut from the script showed Max and Nicki&#x27;s faces melting together while kissing and going across the floor to a bystander&#x27;s leg and melting him.

Michael Lennick served as special video effects supervisor. To create the breathing effects of the television set that Max interacts with, Frank C. Carere utilized an air compressor with valves hooked to a piano keyboard that he himself operated. The undulating screen of the television set was created using a video projector and a sheet of rubbery dental dam. Baker stated that &quot;I knew we would need a flexible material ... we tested with a weather balloon first, stretching it over a frame the size of a TV screen, and pushed a hand through it to see how far it stretched, and then we rear-projected on it.&quot; Betamax videotape cassettes were used as items to be inserted into Max&#x27;s stomach slit, because VHS cassettes were too large to fit the faux abdominal wound. Woods found the stomach slit uncomfortable, and after a long day of wearing it, vented, &quot;I am not an actor anymore. I&#x27;m just the bearer of the slit!&quot; Baker&#x27;s original concept for Max&#x27;s flesh gun featured eyes, mouth and foreskin, which Cronenberg found to be &quot;too graphic&quot;. The cancer effects caused by Max&#x27;s flesh gun went through various tests, with some tests having the face of the victim being distorted through the use of solvents, but Baker decided against this upon learning that his mentor, Dick Smith, had recently used the same technique in &quot; Spasms&quot;. Baker settled on having the cancer tumors burst out from the body of Barry Convex, with his crew operating a dummy underneath the set. Lennick devised effects such as having the image of the Videodrome television set distort whenever Max would whip it through the use of a device which he called the &quot;Videodromer&quot;, and glitch and twitch effects related to Max&#x27;s visions through the Videodrome helmet, but these effects were scrapped due to budget and time concerns.

===Music===

An original score was composed for &quot;Videodrome&quot; by Cronenberg&#x27;s close friend, Howard Shore. The score was composed to follow Max Renn&#x27;s descent into video hallucinations, starting out with dramatic orchestral music that increasingly incorporates, and eventually emphasizes, electronic instrumentation. To achieve this, Shore composed the entire score for an orchestra before programming it into a Synclavier II digital synthesizer. The rendered score, taken from the Synclavier II, was then recorded being played in tandem with a small string section. The resulting sound was a subtle blend that often made it difficult to tell which sounds were real and which were synthesized.

The soundtrack was also released on vinyl by Varèse Sarabande, and was re-released on compact disc in 1998. The album itself is not just a straight copy of Shore&#x27;s score, but a remix. Shore has commented that while there were small issues with some of the acoustic numbers, &quot;on the whole I think they did very well&quot;.

===Editing===
Cronenberg stated that the first test screening of a 72-75 minute cut of the film was &quot;the most disastrous screening you can imagine&quot;. He and editor Ronald Sanders &quot;thought we had cut it really tight, but it was totally incomprehensible that you didn&#x27;t even know that Max Renn worked at Civic TV, I&#x27;d cut out all the footage that explained that&quot;.

The MPAA requested multiple edits to the film. Bob Remy, the head of Universal Pictures, also suggested removing the scene in &quot;Samurai Dreams&quot; showing the dildo. Cronenberg was confused by Remy&#x27;s suggestion as the &quot;MPAA didn&#x27;t even ask me to cut that. Why is he asking me to cut that&quot;. Thom Mount told Cronenberg that it was due to Remy having &quot;a problem with cocks&quot;. The film&#x27;s runtime was 87 minutes and 18 seconds in Canada and the United States, but was 15 seconds longer in the international version.

Cronenberg was critical of edits Universal Pictures performed on the film without request from the MPAA.

== Themes ==
According to Tim Lucas, &quot;Videodrome&quot; deals with &quot;the impression of a sprawlingly technological world on our human senses; the fascination and horror of sex and violence; and the boundaries of reality and consciousness.&quot;

==Release==
David was able to get Universal Pictures to finance and distribute the film based &quot;on a one-page description,&quot; according to Cronenberg. &quot;Videodrome&quot; was distributed by Universal Pictures in Canada and the United States, and by Les Films Mutuels in Quebec. It was released in six hundred theatres on February 4, 1983.

Cronenberg stated that Sidney Sheinberg regretted giving the film a wide theatrical release rather than treating it as an art film. Around 900 prints of the film were distributed according to Cronenberg, and the film was only in theaters for a short amount of time. Cronenberg stated that &quot;Videodrome&quot; &quot;wasn&#x27;t an exploitation sell, and it wasn&#x27;t an art sell. I don&#x27;t know what it was.&quot;

==Reception==
The film holds a aggregate rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews, with an average score of . Its consensus states, &quot;Visually audacious, disorienting, and just plain weird, &quot;Videodrome&quot; musings on technology, entertainment, and politics still feel fresh today.&quot; It has been described as a &quot;disturbing techno-surrealist film&quot; and &quot;burningly intense, chaotic, indelibly surreal, absolutely like nothing else&quot;.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked on the film&#x27;s &quot;innovativeness&quot;, and praised Woods&#x27; performance as having a &quot;sharply authentic edge&quot;. Adam Smith of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film 4 out of 5 possible stars, calling it a &quot;perfect example&quot; of body horror. The staff of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film &quot;proves more fascinating than distancing&quot;, and commended the &quot;stunning visual effects&quot;. Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave the film a negative review, calling it &quot;simultaneously stupefying and boring&quot;.

C.J. Henderson reviewed &quot;Videodrome&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 63. Henderson commented that &quot;Despite the fact that &quot;Videodrome&quot; came and went faster than Superman and his bullet, it is still an excellent picture. It is a genre film of high caliber, posing a number of important questions.&quot;

Christopher John reviewed &quot;Videodrome&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #14 and commented that &quot;As usual, Cronenberg has pulled no punches in getting his message across. The movie is tight, and perfectly clear for anyone willing to &quot;watch&quot; the screen and &quot;think&quot; about what they are seeing.&quot;

Trace Thurman of Bloody Disgusting listed it as one of eight &quot;horror movies that were ahead of their time&quot;. It was also selected as one of the &quot;23 weirdest films of all time&quot; by &quot;Total Film&quot;. Nick Schager of &quot;Esquire&quot; ranked the film at number 10 on their list of &quot;the 50 best horror movies of the 1980s&quot;.

===Awards===
The film won a number of awards upon its release. At the 1984 Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film, it tied with &quot;Bloodbath at the House of Death&quot; for Best Science-Fiction Film, and Mark Irwin received a CSC Award for Best Cinematography in a Theatrical Feature. &quot;Videodrome&quot; was also nominated for eight Genie Awards, with David Cronenberg tying Bob Clark&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; for Best Achievement in Direction.

It was the first Genie Award that Cronenberg won.

&quot;Videodrome&quot; was named the 89th-most-essential film in history by the Toronto International Film Festival.

==Home media==
&quot;Videodrome&quot; was released on VHS and DVD in the late 1990s by Universal Studios Home Entertainment, who also released the film on LaserDisc.

The film was released on DVD by the Criterion Collection on August 31, 2004, and their Blu-ray edition was released on December 7, 2010. The Criterion Blu-ray features two commentary tracks, one with Cronenberg and cinematographer Mark Irwin, and the other with actors James Woods and Deborah Harry. Among the other special features are a documentary titled &quot;Forging the New Flesh&quot;; the soft-core video &quot;Samurai Dreams&quot;; the 2000 short film &quot;Camera&quot;; three trailers for &quot;Videodrome&quot;; and &quot;Fear on Film&quot;, which consists of an interview with Cronenberg, John Carpenter and John Landis, hosted by Mick Garris.

In 2015, Arrow Films released the film on Blu-ray in Region B with further special features, including Cronenberg&#x27;s short films &quot;Transfer&quot; (1966) and &quot;From the Drain&quot; (1967), as well as his feature films &quot;Stereo&quot; (1969) and &quot;Crimes of the Future&quot; (1970).

==Novelization==
A novelization of &quot;Videodrome&quot; was released by Zebra Books alongside the movie in 1983. Though credited to &quot;Jack Martin&quot;, the novel was, in fact, the work of horror novelist Dennis Etchison. Cronenberg reportedly invited Etchison up to Toronto, where they discussed and clarified the story, allowing the novel to remain as close as possible to the actions in the film. There are some differences, however, such as the inclusion of the &quot;bathtub sequence&quot;, a scene never filmed in which a television rises from Max Renn&#x27;s bathtub like in Sandro Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot;. This was the result of the lead time required to write the book, which left Etchison working with an earlier draft of the script than was used in the film.

<doc id="456588" wikidata="Q822930" url="?curid=456588" title="Cheaper by the Dozen (2003 film)">
<text>Cheaper by the Dozen is a 2003 American comedy film directed by Shawn Levy. It is a remake of the 1950 film of the same name. Both films were inspired by the semi-autobiographical book &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; by Frank Bunker Gilbreth Jr. and his sister Ernestine Gilbreth Carey. It stars Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt, Hilary Duff, Tom Welling, and Piper Perabo, alongside Kevin G. Schmidt, Alyson Stoner, Jacob Smith, Forrest Landis, Liliana Mumy, Morgan York, Blake Woodruff, Brent and Shane Kinsman, Paula Marshall, and Alan Ruck in supporting roles. Outside of a passing mention of the Gilbreth name, the film has little connection with the original source material.

The film was released on December 25, 2003, by 20th Century Fox and grossed $190 million worldwide against a $40 million budget. The Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus criticized the film for its lack of humor.

A sequel, &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen 2&quot;, was released in 2005. Another remake was released in 2022 on Disney+.

==Plot==

Tom Baker is a football coach at a small rural college in Midland, Illinois, where he raised twelve children. His wife, Kate, has written her story in a book and hopes to send it to her friend for publication. One day, Tom unexpectedly receives an offer from his old friend and football teammate Shake McGuire to coach at his alma mater in his hometown of Evanston, Illinois. Tom accepts the offer, and demands all the children vote on moving. Despite losing the vote, Tom has the entire family return to Evanston for a better home and space. The atmosphere at the Bakers&#x27; new house is tense and the situation at school is even worse.

When her book is ready to pick up for publication, Kate is required to do a national book tour to promote it. Tom thinks that he can handle everything in the family&#x27;s household while Kate is away, so he hires the family&#x27;s oldest child, Nora, and her self-absorbed boyfriend, Hank, to manage the children. When Nora and Hank arrive, the younger children make Hank the target of their prank by soaking his underwear in raw meat and siccing the Bakers&#x27; pet dog Gunner on him to bite his buttocks, prompting him to refuse to assist in babysitting. As a result, Nora drives off with Hank, while Tom lectures them for their prank.

After Kate departs for her book tour, Tom realizes that he cannot handle the children on his own after a chaotic night. He tries to hire a housekeeper, but nobody is willing to work with a family as large as the Bakers. Tom decides to bring the football players from work into his house for game practicing in the living room (to prepare for the Saturday night football game) while the children perform chores and their household games. However, they start causing trouble at school and Charlie, the Bakers&#x27; oldest son, is removed from the football team. Kate overhears from the children about the chaos and cancels the book tour to take charge of the situation. Kate&#x27;s publisher decides to create an additional promotion for her book by inviting Oprah Winfrey to tape a segment about the Bakers in their home instead.

Despite much coaching from Kate, the Bakers are not able to demonstrate the loving, strongly bonded family that Kate described in her book. When Mark, one of the younger children, becomes upset that his pet frog has died, a heated fight erupts moments before the segment starts, leading the cameramen to call Winfrey to cancel the segment. Mark runs away from home, prompting the Bakers to find him. Tom indulges a hunch that Mark is trying to run back to the Bakers&#x27; old home, and eventually finds Mark on an Amtrak train departing from Chicago to Midland.

Reuniting with the rest of their family, the Bakers begin to address their issues with each other, and Tom ultimately resigns from his position at his alma mater.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 24% rating based on reviews from 119 critics and an average score of 4.58/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;In this family of twelve children, much chaos ensues, but little hilarity.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 46 out of 100 based on 30 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an A− grade.

Despite this, the film was given &quot;Two Thumbs Up&quot; from Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper on their television show. Ebert in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and called it &quot;lighthearted fun&quot;.

Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; was critical of the uneven tone of the film, varying between &quot;schmaltzy/gooey and slapstick/gross-out&quot; and wrote that it was &quot;as far from the original pic and its autobiographical memoir source as it can be while retaining the same title&quot; but predicted a wide-ranging audience for the film.

===Box office===
The film ranked at #2 for the weekend, grossing $27,557,647 in its opening weekend ($35,397,241 including its Thursday Christmas Day gross of $7,839,594) from 3,298 theaters for an average of $8,356 per theater ($10,733 average per theater over four days), being kept from the top spot by &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. The film went on to gross $138,614,544 in North America, and an additional $51,597,569 internationally, for a total gross of $190,212,113 worldwide, nearly five times its $40 million budget.

===Accolades===
Ashton Kutcher was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor for his performance in this, &quot;Just Married&quot; and &quot;My Boss&#x27;s Daughter&quot; but lost to Ben Affleck with &quot;Daredevil&quot;, &quot;Gigli&quot; and &quot;Paycheck&quot;.

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS and DVD on April 6, 2004 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

<doc id="456590" wikidata="Q1127291" url="?curid=456590" title="Clever Hans">
<text>Clever Hans (; ) was a horse that appeared to perform arithmetic and other intellectual tasks. In 1907, psychologist Oskar Pfungst demonstrated that the horse was not actually performing these mental tasks, but was watching the reactions of his trainer. The horse was responding directly to involuntary cues in the body language of the human trainer, who was entirely unaware that he was providing such cues. In honour of Pfungst&#x27;s study, this type of artifact in research methodology has since been referred to as the &quot;Clever Hans effect&quot; and has continued to be important to the observer-expectancy effect and later studies in animal cognition.
Pfungst was an assistant to German philosopher and psychologist Carl Stumpf, who incorporated the experience with Hans into his further work on animal psychology and his ideas on phenomenology.

==Spectacle==

During the early twentieth century, the public was especially interested in animal intelligence owing in large part to Charles Darwin&#x27;s recent publications. The case of Clever Hans was taken to show an advanced level of number sense in an animal.

Hans was a horse owned by Wilhelm von Osten, who was a gymnasium mathematics teacher, an amateur horse trainer and phrenologist and was considered to be a mystic. Hans was said to have been taught to add, subtract, multiply, divide, work with fractions, tell the time, keep track of the calendar, differentiate between musical tones, and read, spell, and understand German. Von Osten would ask Hans, &quot;If the eighth day of the month comes on a Tuesday, what is the date of the following Friday?&quot; Hans would answer by tapping his hoof eleven times. Questions could be asked both orally and in written form. Von Osten exhibited Hans throughout Germany and never charged admission. Hans&#x27; abilities were reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1904.

After von Osten died in 1909, Hans was acquired by several owners. He was then drafted into World War I as a military horse and &quot;killed in action in 1916 or was consumed by hungry soldiers&quot;.

==Investigation==
The great public interest in Clever Hans led the German board of education to appoint a commission to investigate von Osten&#x27;s scientific claims. Philosopher and psychologist Carl Stumpf formed a panel of 13 people, known as the &quot;Hans Commission&quot;. This commission consisted of a veterinarian, a circus manager, a cavalry officer, a number of schoolteachers, and the director of the Berlin zoological gardens. This commission concluded in September 1904 that no tricks were involved in Hans&#x27;s performance.

The commission passed off the evaluation to Oskar Pfungst, who tested the basis for these claimed abilities by:
# Isolating horse and questioner from spectators, so no cues could come from them
# Using questioners other than the horse&#x27;s master
# By means of blinders, varying whether the horse could see the questioner
# Varying whether the questioner knew the answer to the question in advance.

Using a substantial number of trials, Pfungst found that the horse could get the correct answer even if von Osten himself did not ask the questions, ruling out the possibility of fraud. However, the horse gave the right answer only when the questioner knew what the answer was and the horse could see the questioner. He observed that when Hans could see the questioner, the horse got 89 percent (50 out of 56) of the answers correct, but when Hans was not able to see the questioner, the horse answered only six percent (2 out of 35) of the questions correctly. 

Pfungst was aware of the ability of circus trainers to train horses to respond to small gestures, and was aware of a number of cases of dogs, like that of English astrophysicist Sir William Huggins, who were able to point to an object their master was looking at or who were able to &quot;bark&quot; the answer to questions like square roots while staring at their master&#x27;s face, and so after refuting his initial suspicion of a fraud involving whispering or the like, began to consider accidental communication with Hans. Pfungst then examined the behaviour of the questioner in detail, and showed that as the horse&#x27;s taps approached the right answer, the questioner&#x27;s posture and facial expression changed in ways that were consistent with an increase in tension, which was released when the horse made the final, correct tap. This provided a cue that the horse could use to stop tapping. The social communication systems of horses may depend on the detection of small postural changes, and this would explain why Hans so easily picked up on the cues given by von Osten, even if these cues were subconscious.

Pfungst carried out laboratory tests with human subjects, in which he played the part of the horse. Pfungst asked subjects to stand on his right and think &quot;with a high degree of concentration&quot; about a particular number, or a simple mathematical problem. Pfungst would then tap out the answer with his right hand. He frequently observed &quot;a sudden slight upward jerk of the head&quot; when reaching the final tap, and noted that this corresponded to the subject resuming the position they had adopted before thinking of the question.

Some critics of Pfungst suggest that a proper way of validating the body language hypothesis should involve Pfungst acting out the same body language cues himself in order to reliably get Hans to give wrong answers. This would have validated the hypothesis that Hans is simply tapping in correspondence with certain body language cues, independently of the true answer; however, Pfungst never was able to successfully validate his hypothesis in this manner. 

After the investigations by Pfungst were done, von Osten, who was never persuaded by Pfungst&#x27;s findings, continued to show Hans around Germany, attracting large and enthusiastic crowds.

==The Clever Hans effect==
After Pfungst had become adept at giving Hans performances himself, and believed he was fully aware of the subtle cues which made them possible, he discovered that he would produce these cues involuntarily regardless of whether he wished to exhibit or suppress them. Recognition of this phenomenon has had a large effect on experimental design and methodology for all experiments whatsoever involving sentient subjects, including humans.

The risk of Clever Hans effects is one reason why comparative psychologists normally test animals in isolated apparatus, without interaction with them. However this creates problems of its own, because many of the most interesting phenomena in animal cognition are only likely to be demonstrated in a social context, and in order to train and demonstrate them, it is necessary to build up a social relationship between trainer and animal. This point of view has been strongly argued by Irene Pepperberg in relation to her studies of parrots (Alex), and by Allen and Beatrix Gardner in their study of the chimpanzee Washoe. If the results of such studies are to gain universal acceptance, it is necessary to find some way of testing the animals&#x27; achievements which eliminates the risk of Clever Hans effects. However, simply removing the trainer from the scene may not be an appropriate strategy, because where the social relationship between trainer and subject is strong, the removal of the trainer may produce emotional responses preventing the subject from performing. It is therefore necessary to devise procedures where none of those present knows what the animal&#x27;s likely response may be.

The Clever Hans effect has also been observed in drug-sniffing dogs. A study at University of California, Davis revealed that cues can be telegraphed by the handler to the dogs, resulting in false positives.

A 2004 study of Rico, a border collie reported by his owners as having a vocabulary of over 200 words, avoided the Clever Hans effect by having the owner ask the dog to fetch items from an adjacent room, so that the owner could not provide real time feedback while the dog was selecting an object.

A study conducted in 2012 examined the socio-communicative ability of dogs with humans, looking at how much of an influence an owner, if present, would have on their dog during an object-choice pointing task, including looking at whether a Clever Hans effect was present. The study concluded that when the experimenter provided a pointing gesture regardless of the owner’s knowledge, and that when no pointing cue was given to the dog, it only performed at chance level. This study proved that, for this pointing task, there was no Clever Hans effect affecting the dogs&#x27; performance, as long as the owners did not actively influence them.

Similarly, a study done in 2013 also examined whether a Clever Hans effect was present in a two-way object choice test and included an experimental group in which the owners actively tried to influence their dog&#x27;s decision. The results showed that the experimenter had the strongest effect on the dog&#x27;s choice in this task, regardless of the owner&#x27;s knowledge or actions. This provides evidence that the Clever Hans effect is not always present when humans and dogs interact.

Pfungst&#x27;s final experiment showed that Clever Hans effects can occur in experiments with humans as well as with animals. For this reason, care is often taken in fields such as perception, cognitive psychology, and social psychology to make experiments double-blind, meaning that neither the experimenter nor the subject knows what condition the subject is in, and thus what their responses are predicted to be. Another way in which Clever Hans effects are avoided is by replacing the experimenter with a computer, which can deliver standardized instructions and record responses without giving clues.

=== Clever Hans effect in Artificial Intelligence ===
In the field of Artificial Intelligence, the Clever Hans effect describes a phenomenon where an algorithm seems to make correct predictions without having the relevant data and/or by using incorrect reasoning. This effect can appear, when a Deep Neural Network&#x27;s predictions are dominated by unknown features, which were not intended for the task, e.g. when an Image Classifier &quot;reads&quot; text on a photo instead of analysing the image motif.

The Clever Hans effect can also be seen as a &quot;secret&quot; overfitting of Deep Neural Networks towards an unknown feature. This overfitting might not affect the algorithm at all as long as the unknown feature is present, while it could lead to unpredictable fails in the absence of the unknown feature. The existence of this effect and its practical imperceceptibility restrict the robustness and validity of most AI models. Explainable AI research tries to find methods to fully comprehend the decision making of AI models in order to detect such Clever Hans correlations.

The German conceptual artist Max Haarich demonstrated the Clever Hans effect in Artificial Intelligence with his art installation “Smart Hans”. Based on the information from Oskar Pfungst&#x27;s book &quot;Clever Hans&quot; (1911), the installation shows an animated horse and uses facial detection and pose estimation to predict which number a person is currently thinking about.

<text>Beclean (; Hungarian and German: &quot;Bethlen&quot;) is a town in Bistrița-Năsăud County, in north-eastern Transylvania, Romania. The town administers three villages: Coldău (&quot;Goldau&quot;; &quot;Várkudu&quot;), Figa (&quot;Füge&quot;), and Rusu de Jos (&quot;Alsóoroszfalu&quot;). 

==Geography==
The town lies on the Transylvanian Plateau, at the confluence of the river Someșul Mare with its affluent, the Șieu. It is located in the western part of the county, at a distance of from the town of Năsăud and from the county seat, Bistrița; the city of Dej is to the west, in Cluj County.

==History==

The town of Beclean is the ancestral seat of the Hungarian Bethlen family.

In 1850, the town had 1,475 inhabitants, of which 805 were Romanians, 327 Hungarians, 163 Jews, 163 Roma, 5 Germans, and 12 of other ethnicities. At the 2011 census, it had 10,628 inhabitants; of those, 81.6% were Romanians, 14.2% Hungarians, and 3.7% Roma. At the 2021 census, Beclean had a population of 11,260.

==Transportation==

Beclean is the site of an important railway junction (the train station is called Beclean pe Someș), where secondary routes to Sighetu Marmației and Suceava diverge from the main Căile Ferate Române railway line 400 from Brașov to Satu Mare.

The town is traversed by two national roads: (part of European route E58), which joins Dej in Cluj County to Suceava, and , which joins Beclean to Cârlibaba in Suceava County. Additionally, county road DJ172A connects it to Gherla in Cluj County, while road DJ172F provides an alternate route to Dej.

==Education==

Beclean is home to four high schools: the Petru Rareș National College, the Henri Coandă Technological High School, the Beclean Agricultural Technological High School, and High School Nr. 1. There is also a middle school, the Grigore Silași Gymnasium.

==Natives==

<doc id="456601" wikidata="Q468700" url="?curid=456601" title="The Fly (1986 film)">
<text>The Fly is a 1986 American science fiction body horror film directed and co-written by David Cronenberg. Produced by Brooksfilms and distributed by 20th Century Fox, the film stars Jeff Goldblum, Geena Davis, and John Getz. Loosely based on George Langelaan&#x27;s 1957 short story of the same name and the 1958 film of the same name, &quot;The Fly&quot; tells of an eccentric scientist who, after one of his experiments goes wrong, slowly turns into a fly-hybrid creature. The score was composed by Howard Shore and the make-up effects were created by Chris Walas, along with makeup artist Stephan Dupuis.

&quot;The Fly&quot; was released on August 15, 1986, to positive reviews. It grossed $60.6 million at the box office, becoming a commercial success. Walas and Dupuis&#x27; work on the film resulted in them winning an Academy Award for Best Makeup. The tagline of the film, &quot;Be afraid. Be very afraid.&quot;, has been used in many other productions as part of popular culture. A sequel, directed by Walas, was released in 1989. In November 2024, a new film set in the same universe as Cronenberg&#x27;s film was announced, to be written and directed by Nikyatu Jusu.

== Plot ==

Seth Brundle, a brilliant but eccentric scientist, meets Ronnie Quaife, a science journalist, at a press event. He takes her back to his home and laboratory and shows her his invention: a set of &quot;telepods&quot; that allows instantaneous teleportation between them. Seth convinces Ronnie to keep the invention secret in exchange for exclusive rights to the story, and she documents his work. Although the telepods can transport inanimate objects, they mutilate live tissue, as demonstrated when a baboon is turned inside-out during an experiment.

Seth and Ronnie begin a relationship. Their first sexual encounter inspires Seth to reprogram the telepod to understand the makeup of living tissue. After he successfully teleports a second baboon, Ronnie hurriedly leaves to confront her editor Stathis Borans about his threat, spurred by his jealousy of Seth, to publish the story without her consent. Embittered and convinced she is rekindling her relationship with Stathis, Seth teleports himself alone, unaware that a housefly has slipped inside the transmitter pod with him. He emerges from the receiving pod seemingly normal. Seth and Ronnie later reconcile.

Seth starts to exhibit increased strength, stamina, and sexual potency, which he attributes to the teleportation &quot;purifying&quot; his body. Ronnie grows concerned about Seth&#x27;s changing personality and the strange, bristly hairs growing from a wound on his back. Seth becomes arrogant and violent, insisting that the teleportation process is beneficial, and tries to force Ronnie to undergo teleportation. When she refuses, he abandons her, goes to a bar and partakes in an arm-wrestling match, where he leaves his opponent with a compound fracture. He brings a woman named Tawny back to his warehouse to have intercourse. When Seth tries to coerce her into teleporting, Ronnie stops him and Seth throws her out as well.

When his fingernails begin falling off, Seth realizes something is wrong. He discovers that the telepod computer, confused by the presence of two lifeforms in the sending pod, fused him with the fly at the molecular-genetic level.

Seth continues to deteriorate, losing body parts and becoming less human in appearance. After several weeks, he reconnects with Ronnie and says he is becoming a hybrid of human and insect he nicknamed &quot;Brundlefly.&quot; He has begun vomiting digestive enzymes onto his food to dissolve it and gained the ability to cling to walls and ceilings. He realizes he is losing his human reason and compassion, driven by primitive impulses he cannot control.

Seth installs a fusion program into the telepod computer, planning to dilute the fly genes in his body with human DNA. Ronnie learns that she is pregnant by Seth and has a nightmare of giving birth to a giant maggot. She has Stathis persuade a doctor to perform an abortion in the middle of the night. Having overheard their conversation, Seth abducts Ronnie before the abortion can take place and begs her to carry the child to term, since it may be the last remnant of his humanity. Stathis breaks into Seth&#x27;s lab with a shotgun, but Seth disfigures him with his corrosive vomit.

Seth reveals his desperate plan to Ronnie: he will use the telepods to fuse himself and her, together with their unborn child, into one entity. As Seth drags her into one of the telepods, she accidentally rips off his jaw, triggering his final transformation into an insectoid-human creature, shedding decayed human skin. Seth traps Ronnie inside the first telepod and enters the other. The wounded Stathis uses his shotgun to sever the cables connecting Ronnie&#x27;s telepod to the computer, allowing Ronnie to escape. Seth becomes fused with the metal door and cabling of telepod 2. As the deformed Seth crawls out of the receiving pod, Ronnie picks up Stathis&#x27; shotgun and hesitantly pulls the trigger, killing Seth at his request.

==Production==
===Preproduction===
In the early 1980s, co-producer Kip Ohman approached screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue with the idea of remaking the classic science fiction horror film &quot;The Fly&quot;. Pogue began by reading George Langelaan&#x27;s short story and then watching the original film, which he had never seen. Deciding that this was a project in which he was interested, he talked with producer Stuart Cornfeld about setting up the production, and Cornfeld very quickly agreed. The duo then pitched the idea to executives at 20th Century Fox and received an enthusiastic response, and Pogue was given money to write a first draft screenplay. He initially wrote an outline similar to that of Langelaan&#x27;s story, but both he and Cornfeld thought that it would be better to rework the material to focus on a gradual metamorphosis instead of an instantaneous monster. However, when executives read the script, they were so unimpressed that they immediately withdrew from the project. After some negotiation, Cornfeld orchestrated a deal whereby Fox would agree to distribute the film if he could set up financing through another source.

The new producer was Mel Brooks; the film was to be produced by his company, Brooksfilms. Cornfeld was a frequent collaborator and friend of Brooks. Cornfeld introduced Brooks to David Lynch through &quot;Eraserhead&quot; and they later produced Lynch&#x27;s &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;. (Brooks would leave his name off the film&#x27;s credits, to avoid confusing viewers who might expect &quot;a Mel Brooks film&quot; to be a comedy.) Cornfeld gave the script to Brooks, who liked it but felt that a different writer was needed. Pogue was then removed from the project, and Cornfeld hired Walon Green for a rewrite. However, Green&#x27;s draft was not a step in the desired direction, so Pogue was then sought to polish the material.

At the same time, Brooks and Cornfeld were trying to find a suitable director. David Cronenberg was shown the script for &quot;The Fly&quot; by Marc Boyman, who later produced &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, but Cronenberg was working on &quot;Total Recall&quot; at the time. Cornfeld decided on a young British director named Robert Bierman after seeing one of his short films. Bierman was flown to Los Angeles to meet with Pogue, and the film was in the very early stages of preproduction when tragedy struck: Bierman&#x27;s family had been vacationing in South Africa, and his daughter was killed in an accident. Bierman boarded a plane to go to his family, and Brooks and Cornfeld waited for a month before approaching him about resuming work on the picture. Bierman told them that he was unable to start working so soon, and Brooks told him that he would wait three months and contact him again. At the end of the three months, Bierman told him that he could not commit to the project. Brooks told him that he understood and had him freed from his contract.

===Writing===

Cronenberg&#x27;s agent, Mike Marcus, informed Cronenberg, after he left the &quot;Total Recall&quot; production, that Mel Brooks was interested in &quot;The Fly&quot;. Cronenberg agreed to sign on as director if he would be allowed to rewrite the script. Cronenberg, who watched the original film when it came out, was critical of the initial script stating that &quot;I remember reading it and the first sixteen pages were awful&quot;. Cronenberg was paid twice the amount that he was paid for directing &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;.

Cronenberg stated that &quot;one line of dialogue from Chuck&#x27;s script&quot; remained in the final version. Despite the extensive rewrite of Pogue&#x27;s script, Cronenberg insisted during Writers Guild arbitrations that he and Pogue share screenplay credit, since he felt that his version could not have come to pass without Pogue&#x27;s script to serve as a foundation. He did not meet with Pogue, who liked the film, until after the film was released.

Pogue&#x27;s version of the lead scientist &quot;was rather a dull, clever techno guy; just a boring, handsome guy&quot; according to Cronenberg.

===Casting===
Brooks wanted Pierce Brosnan to play the role of Seth Brundle, but Cronenberg rejected the casting. John Malkovich was the top choice for the role, but he declined. John Lithgow was also offered the role but turned it down, stating it was too grotesque. Michael Keaton and Richard Dreyfuss were also considered. Jeff Goldblum was proposed for the lead by Cronenberg as Goldblum was willing to perform with prosthetic makeup unlike other proposed actors like Dreyfuss.

Cornfeld opposed Geena Davis&#x27; casting due to her being Goldblum&#x27;s then-real-life girlfriend. Cronenberg wanted Davis and Cornfeld made him &quot;look at other actresses, but they were all disasters&quot; which even Cornfeld admitted. Davis requested that Cronenberg play the gynecologist as she did not want a stranger performing the role.

===Filming===

The film&#x27;s budget was reported as $9 million and $15 million. It was shot in Canada at the Kleinburg Studio in Toronto. Chris Walas, who worked on &quot;Scanners&quot;, was hired to create the film&#x27;s special effects. Principal photography began on December 1, 1985, in Toronto.

The film&#x27;s audio mixing was done in London as it was cheaper than Los Angeles. The producers commissioned musician Bryan Ferry to record a song for the film for promotional purposes. The resulting track was &quot;Help Me&quot;. A music video was made for the song, and footage from the film was prominently featured in it. Cronenberg admitted to liking the song, but he felt that it was inappropriate to the film itself. Brooks and Cornfeld originally wanted to play the song over the closing credits, but after Cronenberg screened it for them, they agreed with the director that it did not mesh with the movie. As a result, the song is featured only briefly in the film, in the background during the scene where Brundle challenges Marky in the bar. &quot;Help Me&quot; became rather obscure, as it was not included on the film&#x27;s soundtrack release. The song resurfaced in 1993 on the Roxy Music/Bryan Ferry compact disc &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot;.

The design of Brundle&#x27;s telepods was inspired by the engine cylinder of Cronenberg&#x27;s Ducati Desmo motorcycle.

===Deleted and alternate scenes===
After filming ended early in 1986, a rough cut of &quot;The Fly&quot; was shown to Fox executives, who were very impressed. A rough cut was then previewed at Toronto&#x27;s Uptown Theatre in the spring of that year. Due to a strong audience reaction, the graphic and infamous &quot;monkey-cat&quot; sequence was cut from the film to make it easier for audiences to maintain sympathy for Brundle&#x27;s character. Another preview screening was subsequently held at the Fox lot in Los Angeles, and this version featured the &quot;butterfly baby&quot; coda. As before, the screening results dictated that the scene be cut. Another ending had Ronnie wake up next to Stathis, who she is married to, and is pregnant with his child, but it was disliked by audiences according to Cronenberg.

===Makeup and creature effects===

The Academy Award-winning makeup was designed and executed by Chris Walas, Inc. over a period of three months. The final &quot;Brundlefly&quot; creature was designed first, and then the various steps needed to carry protagonist Seth Brundle to that final incarnation were designed. The transformation was intended to be a metaphor for the aging process. To that end, Brundle loses hair, teeth and fingernails, with his skin becoming more and more discolored and lumpy. The intention of the filmmakers was to give Brundle a bruised and cancerous look that gets progressively worse as the character&#x27;s altered genome slowly asserts itself, with the final Brundlefly hybrid creature literally bursting out of Brundle&#x27;s hideously deteriorated human skin. The creature itself was designed to appear horribly asymmetrical and deformed, and not at all a viable or robust organism.

Various looks were tested for the makeup effects. Some early test footage can be seen on the 2005 &quot;The Fly&quot;: Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD, as well as the Blu-ray release.

The transformation was broken up into seven distinct stages, with Jeff Goldblum spending many hours in the makeup chair for Brundle&#x27;s later incarnations.

* Stages 1 and 2: subtle, rash-like skin discoloration that leads to facial lesions and sores, with tiny fly hairs dotting Goldblum&#x27;s face, in addition to the patch of fly hairs growing out of the wound on Brundle&#x27;s back.
* Stages 3 and 4-A: piecemeal prosthetics covering Goldblum&#x27;s face (and later his arms, feet, and torso), wigs with bald spots, and crooked, prosthetic teeth (beginning with stage 4-A).
* Stage 4-B: deleted from the film (but briefly appeared in the trailer), this variant of stage 4 was seen only in the &quot;monkey-cat&quot; scene, and required Goldblum to wear the first of two full-body foam latex suits, as Brundle has stopped wearing clothing at this point.
* Stage 5: the second full-body suit, with more exaggerated deformities, and which also required Goldblum to wear distorting contact lenses that made one eye look larger than the other.
* Stage 6: the final &quot;Brundlefly&quot; creature (referred to as the &quot;space bug&quot; by the film&#x27;s crew), depicted by various partial and full-body cable- and rod-controlled puppets.
* Stage 7: another puppet which represented the mortally injured Brundlefly-Telepod fusion creature (initially dubbed the &quot;Brundlebooth&quot; and later the &quot;Brundlething&quot; by the crew) as seen in the film&#x27;s final moments.

== Music ==
The score to &quot;The Fly&quot; was composed and conducted by Howard Shore, and performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra. It was released on record, cassette, and Compact Disc (with three additional tracks exclusively included on the latter) by Varèse Sarabande, and in 2005, it was remastered and reissued on a two-disc set with Christopher Young&#x27;s album for &quot;The Fly II&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film earned $40,456,565 domestically and $20,172,594 internationally, totaling $60,629,159 at the worldwide box office.

===Critical response===
According to Metacritic, &quot;The Fly&quot; received &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, based on a weighted average of 81 out of 100 from 12 critic reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 74 reviews are positive for the film, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;David Cronenberg combines his trademark affinity for gore and horror with strongly developed characters, making &quot;The Fly&quot; a surprisingly affecting tragedy.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

After its release, &quot;The Fly&quot; was described as a remake that surpasses the original and exceeds the potential of the original story. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it a rare personal work of art that is also a commercial success. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; hailed the film as a stunning piece of filmmaking that allowed the audience to identify with the monstrous creation. &quot;Time&quot; wrote that &quot;The Fly&quot; is a shocking horror film and also the most touching romance film of the year. Conversely, Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the film for what she considered distractingly excessive gore, lack of emotional depth and tonal inconsistency. She felt that the film tries to be too many things at once and ultimately falls short, despite Goldblum&#x27;s performance and the ambitious vision of Cronenberg.

Cronenberg was surprised when &quot;The Fly&quot; was seen by some critics as a cultural metaphor specifically for AIDS, since he originally intended the film to be a more general analogy for disease itself, terminal conditions like cancer and, more specifically, the aging process:

&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; film critic Gene Siskel named &quot;The Fly&quot; as the tenth-best film of 1986. In agreement with Siskel, fellow Chicago film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, said the film was on his top 20 films list for 1986 and that &quot;Goldblum, I think, deserves an Academy Award nomination&quot; for his role in &quot;The Fly.&quot; In 1989, &quot;Premiere&quot; and &quot;American Film&quot; magazines both conducted independent polls of American film critics, directors and other such groups to determine the best films of the 1980s, and &quot;The Fly&quot; appeared on both lists.

In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; magazine film critics Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel included &quot;The Fly&quot; in their list of the &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s All-Time 100 Movies. &quot;Time&quot; later named it one of the 25 best horror films. The film was ranked #33 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot;. Similarly, the Chicago Film Critics Association named &quot;The Fly&quot; the 32nd scariest film ever made. In 2021, &quot;The Daily Star&quot; ranked &quot;The Fly&quot; at the top of its list of greatest short story adaptations, praising the film for &quot;exhibit[ing] how greater a short story can evolve, and very much become its own detached, barely recognisable thing.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;The Fly&quot; was nominated for the awards in the chart below. Many genre fans and film critics at the time thought that Jeff Goldblum&#x27;s performance would receive a Best Actor Oscar nomination, but this did not happen. Gene Siskel subsequently stated that Goldblum most likely &quot;got stiffed&quot; out of a nomination because the older Academy voters generally do not honor horror films.

===Legacy===
The quote &quot;Be afraid. Be very afraid.&quot; was also used as the film&#x27;s marketing tagline, and this became so ingrained in popular culture (as it—and variants—have appeared in numerous films and TV series) that many people who are familiar with the phrase are unaware that it originated in &quot;The Fly&quot;.

On October 10, 2020, the film was referenced in a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch regarding the 2020 vice presidential debate. Jim Carrey provided an impression of Jeff Goldblum.

Heavy metal band Ice Nine Kills released &quot;F.L.Y&quot; as part of their 2021 album &quot;The Silver Scream 2: Welcome to Horrorwood&quot;. The song is inspired by the 1986 film.

==Other media==
===Sequel===

Whereas the 1958 original was followed by two sequels, Cronenberg has said that the stories in his films have definitive beginnings and endings, and he has never considered making a sequel to one of his own films, although others have made sequels to Cronenberg films, including &quot;Scanners&quot; (1981).

&quot;The Fly II&quot; (1989) was directed by Chris Walas, the man behind the makeup and creature effects of both films and &quot;Gremlins&quot;. It is a direct continuation of &quot;The Fly&quot;. It features Veronica Quaife giving birth to Brundle&#x27;s mutant son before dying, and it focuses on the Bartok company&#x27;s attempts to get the Telepods working again.

David Cronenberg was not involved with the project. The only actor to return for the sequel was John Getz as an embittered Stathis Borans. Veronica Quaife appears briefly in the film. She is played by Saffron Henderson, since Geena Davis declined to reprise the role. Jeff Goldblum appears in archival footage of Seth Brundle in two scenes, including the post-teleportation interview segment that was deleted from the first film.

An early treatment for a sequel, written by Tim Lucas, involved Veronica Quaife dealing with the evils of the Bartok company. Brundle&#x27;s consciousness had somehow survived within the Telepod computer, and the Bartok scientists had enslaved him and were using him to develop the system for cloning purposes. Brundle becomes able to communicate with Veronica through the computer, and he eventually takes control of the Bartok complex&#x27;s security systems to gruesomely attack the villains. Eventually, Veronica frees Brundle by conspiring with him to reintegrate a non-contaminated version of his original body. Cronenberg endorsed this concept at the time. Geena Davis was open to doing a sequel (and only pulled out of &quot;The Fly II&quot; because her character was to be killed in the opening scene), while Goldblum was not (although he determined a cameo appearance was acceptable), and this treatment reflects that. However, a later treatment written by Jim and Ken Wheat was used as the basis for the final script, written by Frank Darabont. Mick Garris also wrote a treatment, with elements incorporated into the final film.

===Comic books===
Beginning in March 2015 IDW Publishing released &quot;The Fly: Outbreak&quot;, a five-issue comic book miniseries written by Brandon Seifert. The story is a direct sequel to the events of &quot;The Fly II&quot;, and features Seth Brundle&#x27;s son, Martin, inadvertently causing a transgenic outbreak while attempting to cure Anton Bartok, to whom he&#x27;d previously transferred his mutant genes at the end of &quot;The Fly II&quot;.

==Canceled projects==
===Renny Harlin&#x27;s alternate sequel===
In the 1990s, Geena Davis was involved with an alternate sequel to &quot;The Fly&quot;, to be directed by her then-husband, Renny Harlin, titled &quot;Flies&quot;. The script by Richard Jefferies featured a story in which Veronica gives birth to twin boys, but survives the ordeal. The paranoid Veronica fears that the boys will begin developing fly-hybrid characteristics. When they eventually do, she uses the teleporter to merge the untainted human genes from each twin into a single, new being. As a result, the authorities believe that she murdered one of the children, since there is now only one child.

===Todd Lincoln&#x27;s second remake===
In 2003, it was announced that a second remake of &quot;The Fly&quot; was being developed, to be directed by Todd Lincoln, produced by Fox Searchlight Pictures, and released in 2006, but this did not happen.

===David Cronenberg&#x27;s sequel===
In 2009, it was rumored that David Cronenberg himself was preparing to direct a second remake of &quot;The Fly&quot;, but it was not until 2011 that the director addressed the rumors. Cronenberg stated that he had written not a remake, but rather a &quot;sort of&quot; sequel script to his 1986 version, and would film it if 20th Century Fox gave the project the go-ahead: 
Cronenberg elaborated further when interviewed by &quot;Empire&quot; in 2012: 
In a late 2012 interview, Cronenberg provided additional details on why the project had stalled, citing 
 He also described the project as &quot;more of a sequel or a sidebar. It was a meditation on fly-ness. None of the same characters or anything and, of course, with an understanding of modern technology.&quot;

Despite Cronenberg&#x27;s prior assertions that he does not make sequels to his films, he returned to &quot;The Fly&quot; for the opera &quot;The Fly&quot; in 2008, and his proposed sequel film project would mark a second return to the material, as well as his first sequel to one of his previous movies. However, the film is not moving forward.

On June 15, 2018, Jeff Goldblum said he would be interested in doing a sequel only if Cronenberg was involved, even though his character died. &quot;I don&#x27;t think my character would be involved because of course I got tragically mutated with the fly and then the machine, oh boy. But maybe I show up as a grandchild of the original Seth Brundle, or Seth Brundle had a brother. Had a brother that emerges in some ways! Who knows, I don&#x27;t know but David Cronenberg was a thrill to work with. Boy, if he was involved, I&#x27;d like to work with him again, I&#x27;ll tell you that.&quot;

<text>Piper Lisa Perabo ( ; born October 31, 1976) is an American actress. Following her breakthrough in the comedy-drama film &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot; (2000), she starred in &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; (2003), its sequel &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen 2&quot; (2005), &quot;The Prestige&quot; (2006), &quot;Angel Has Fallen&quot; (2019), and as CIA agent Annie Walker in the USA Network spy drama series &quot;Covert Affairs&quot; (2010–2014), for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama.

==Early life==
Born in Dallas, Texas and raised in Toms River, New Jersey, Perabo is the child of Mary Charlotte (née Ulland), a physical therapist, and George William Perabo, a lecturer in poetry at Ocean County College. She is of English, German, and Irish (father) and Norwegian (mother) descent; her surname is sometimes mistakenly described as Portuguese. 

Perabo&#x27;s parents named her after actress Piper Laurie. She is the eldest of three children with two brothers, Noah and Adam. She graduated from Toms River High School North in 1994, and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in theater from Honors Tutorial College at Ohio University in 1998. In 1996, she attended the Trinity/La MaMa Performing Arts Program. She also studied Latin, physics, and poetry in her final year.

Perabo was first noticed a year before she graduated from college. She was in New York City, visiting her then-boyfriend, and accompanied him to an audition. Casting director Denise Fitzgerald spotted her and asked her to read for a part. She was not cast, but when Fitzgerald found out that she did not have any representation, she made phone calls on Perabo&#x27;s behalf and found her an agent.

==Career==
===1997–2007: Beginning and breakthrough===
After graduating, Perabo moved to New York, where she worked as a waitress. She also studied acting at the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club and had roles in various plays. She was cast in her first feature film just a month after moving to the city, Marc Levin&#x27;s comedy &quot;Whiteboyz&quot;. In 2000, she was cast in the romantic musical comedy-drama film &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot; as Violet &quot;Jersey&quot; Sanford, for which she won an MTV Movie Award for Best Music Moment for &quot;One Way or Another&quot;. Despite the film&#x27;s mixed response from critics, it was a box office success, grossing over $113 million worldwide. She also appeared in &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; as FBI agent Karen Sympathy.

After the success of &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;, Perabo decided to focus on independent films. In 2001, she starred in an independent Canadian drama called &quot;Lost and Delirious&quot;, playing a boarding school student who falls in love with a female classmate (played by Jessica Paré). The film was met with mixed reviews, but the performances of Perabo, Paré and co-star Mischa Barton were widely praised. Perabo&#x27;s performance in particular received critical acclaim; Loren King of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it her &quot;breakout performance&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Owen Gleiberman called her &quot;an actress of glittering ferocity&quot; and her performance &quot;a geyser of emotion&quot;. Jim Lane of the &quot;Sacramento News &amp; Review&quot; said that &quot;Perabo is a revelation, wild and fiery — it&#x27;s a breakthrough performance, astonishing in its fervency&quot; and Roger Ebert praised her performance for its sincerity and &quot;wonderful abandon and conviction&quot;.

The next year she starred as a French exchange student in the independent comedy &quot;Slap Her... She&#x27;s French&quot;, which was shelved in North America for two years, then released under the new title &quot;She Gets What She Wants&quot;. The film was released under its original title in Europe. She had a role as the eldest Baker child, Nora, in &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; (2003), a role she reprised in the film&#x27;s 2005 sequel. Her other films include &quot;The I Inside&quot; (2003), &quot;Perfect Opposites&quot; (2004), &quot;George and the Dragon&quot; (2004), &quot;The Cave&quot; (2005), &quot;Imagine Me &amp; You&quot; (2005), &quot;Edison&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Prestige&quot; (2006).
===2008–present: &quot;Covert Affairs&quot; and other work===
In 2008, Perabo co-starred with Jamie Lee Curtis in the family comedy film &quot;Beverly Hills Chihuahua&quot;. Also that year, she made her off-Broadway debut in the Neil LaBute play &quot;Reasons to Be Pretty&quot;. As the play&#x27;s run was coming to an end, she read the script for the USA Network television spy drama series &quot;Covert Affairs&quot;: &quot;I was reading movie scripts and I wasn&#x27;t finding anything that was really speaking to me and my agent suggested that I read [the &quot;Covert Affairs&quot; script]. And I hadn&#x27;t thought about doing television, but when I read it, it kind of changed everything for me. She&#x27;s such a powerful character, she&#x27;s so smart, the action is so intense, and I really thought it would be fun to do.&quot;

The following year, Perabo was cast as CIA field agent Annie Walker, the lead character in &quot;Covert Affairs&quot;. For her work in the series, she received a nomination for the 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama. The series ran for five seasons, from 2010 to 2014.

In September 2012, Perabo had a supporting role, alongside Bruce Willis, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Emily Blunt, in the time travel thriller film &quot;Looper&quot;. In December 2012, she was cast in a recurring role on the sitcom &quot;Go On&quot;. Her character, Simone, was a former member of Matthew Perry&#x27;s character&#x27;s support group, who returned and became his love interest. She was originally scheduled to appear in three episodes, but this was increased to four.

Perabo had a starring role in the thriller &quot;Into the Grizzly Maze&quot;, which was released in 2015. She starred as Julia George in the ABC drama series &quot;Notorious&quot; (2016). She co-starred with Antonio Banderas in the thriller film &quot;Black Butterfly&quot;, which was released in May 2017. In June 2018, it was announced that Perabo was cast as Sara in the Netflix comedy series &quot;Turn Up Charlie&quot;. Also in 2019, she starred as Leah Banning in the action film &quot;Angel Has Fallen&quot;. In 2020, she had a recurring role as Linda Craft in the Showtime supernatural horror series &quot;Penny Dreadful: City of Angels&quot;.

Perabo co-starred as Angela in the 2020 dark comedy film, &quot;Spontaneous&quot;.

In 2021, Perabo joined the cast of &quot;Yellowstone&quot; as Summer Higgins, an animal rights activist and ally of John (season 4).

==Personal life==
In 2013, Perabo became engaged to director and writer Stephen Kay; they married on July 26, 2014, in New York City. Perabo is stepmother to Kay&#x27;s daughter.

Perabo has been close friends with actress Lena Headey since they starred together in the 2005 films &quot;The Cave&quot; and &quot;Imagine Me &amp; You&quot;. She speaks fluent French, advocates for LGBT rights and women&#x27;s political leadership, and serves on the advisory board of VoteRunLead. She is part owner of Employees Only, a Prohibition-themed bar in the West Village, that opened in 2005, and Jack&#x27;s Wife Freda, a SoHo restaurant that opened in 2012.

==Political activism==
Perabo was arrested for protesting Brett Kavanaugh&#x27;s Supreme Court confirmation hearing.
She was also arrested in November 2019 while attending one of Jane Fonda&#x27;s weekly climate change protests.

Perabo endorsed Elizabeth Warren in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries and regularly uses her Twitter and Instagram accounts to advocate for voter registration and voter education. She has encouraged followers to seek out VoteRiders to learn more about Voter ID requirements.

Perabo is an advisory board member for The Hometown Project, a non-profit organisation that works to help elect candidates in local races.

Perabo endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election.

<doc id="456612" wikidata="Q20819848" url="?curid=456612" title="Checkmate">
<text>Checkmate (often shortened to mate) is any game position in chess and other chess-like games in which a player&#x27;s king is in check (threatened with ) and there is no possible escape. Checkmating the opponent wins the game.

In chess, the king is never actually captured. The player loses as soon as the player&#x27;s king is checkmated. In formal games, it is usually considered good etiquette to resign an inevitably lost game before being checkmated.

If a player is not in check but has no legal moves, then it is &quot;stalemate&quot;, and the game immediately ends in a draw. A checkmating move is recorded in algebraic notation using the hash symbol &quot;#&quot;, for example: 34.Qg3#. 
==Examples==
A checkmate may occur in as few as two moves on one side with all of the pieces still on the board (as in fool&#x27;s mate, in the opening phase of the game), in a middlegame position (as in the 1956 game called the Game of the Century between Donald Byrne and Bobby Fischer), or after many moves with as few as three pieces in an endgame position.



==Etymology==
The term &quot;checkmate&quot; is, according to the Barnhart Etymological Dictionary, an alteration of the Persian phrase &quot;shāh māt&quot; () which means &quot;the King is helpless&quot;. Persian &quot;māt&quot; applies to the king but in Sanskrit &quot;māta&quot;, also pronounced &quot;māt&quot;, applied to his kingdom &quot;traversed, measured across, and meted out&quot; thoroughly by his opponent; &quot;māta&quot; is the past participle of &quot;mā&quot; verbal root. Others maintain that it means &quot;the King is dead&quot;, as chess reached Europe via the Arab world, and Arabic &quot;māta&quot; () means &quot;died&quot; or &quot;is dead&quot;. Moghadam traced the etymology of the word &quot;mate&quot;. It comes from a Persian verb &quot;mandan&quot; (), meaning &quot;to remain&quot;, which is cognate with the Latin word and the Greek &quot;menō&quot; (, which means &quot;I remain&quot;). It means &quot;remained&quot; in the sense of &quot;abandoned&quot; and the formal translation is &quot;surprised&quot;, in the military sense of &quot;ambushed&quot;. &quot;Shāh&quot; () is the Persian word for the monarch. Players would announce &quot;Shāh&quot; when the king was in check. &quot;Māt&quot; () is a Persian adjective for &quot;at a loss&quot;, &quot;helpless&quot;, or &quot;defeated&quot;. So the king is in &quot;mate&quot; when he is ambushed, at a loss, helpless, defeated, or abandoned to his fate.

In modern Persian, the word &quot;mate&quot; depicts a person who is frozen, open-mouthed, staring, confused and unresponsive. The words &quot;stupefied&quot; or &quot;stunned&quot; bear close correlation. So a possible alternative would be to interpret &quot;mate&quot; as &quot;unable to respond&quot;. A king being in &quot;mate&quot; (shah-mat) then means a king is unable to respond, which would correspond to there being no response that a player&#x27;s king can make to the opponent&#x27;s final move. This interpretation is much closer to the original intent of the game being not to kill a king but to leave him with no viable response other than surrender, which better matches the origin story detailed in the Shahnameh.

In modern parlance, the term &quot;checkmate&quot; is a metaphor for an irrefutable and strategic victory.

==History==
In early Sanskrit chess ( 500–700), the king could be and this ended the game. The Persians (c. 700–800) introduced the idea of warning that the king was under attack (announcing &quot;check&quot; in modern terminology). This was done to avoid the early and accidental end of a game. Later, the Persians added the additional rule that a king could not be moved into check or left in check. As a result, the king could not be captured, and checkmate was the only decisive way of ending a game.

Before about 1600, the game could also be won by capturing all of the opponent&#x27;s pieces, leaving just a bare king. This style of play is now called &quot;annihilation&quot; or &quot;robado&quot;. In Medieval times, players began to consider it nobler to win by checkmate, so annihilation became a half-win for a while, until it was abandoned.

==Two major pieces==

Two (queens or rooks) can easily checkmate on the edge of the board using a technique known as the &quot;ladder checkmate&quot;. The process is to put the two pieces on adjacent or and force the king to the side of the board by using one piece to check the king and the other to cut it off from going up the board. In the illustration, White checkmates by forcing the Black king to the edge, one row at a time. The ladder checkmate can be used to checkmate with two rooks, two queens, or a rook and a queen.


==Basic checkmates==
There are four fundamental checkmates when one side has only their king and the other side has only the minimum needed to force checkmate, i.e. (1) one queen, (2) one rook, (3) two bishops on opposite-colored squares, or (4) a bishop and a knight. The king must help in accomplishing all of these checkmates. If the winning side has more material, checkmates are easier.

The checkmate with the queen is the most common, and easiest to achieve. It often occurs after a pawn has queened. A checkmate with the rook is also common, but a checkmate with two bishops or with a bishop and knight occurs infrequently. The two-bishop checkmate is fairly easy to accomplish, but the bishop and knight checkmate is difficult and requires precision.

===King and queen===

The first two diagrams show representatives of the basic checkmate positions with a queen, which can occur on any edge of the board. Naturally, the exact position can vary from the diagram. In the first of the checkmate positions, the queen is directly in front of the opposing king and the white king is protecting its queen. In the second checkmate position, the kings are in opposition and the queen mates on the (or ) of the king.

|White checkmates easily.
With the side with the queen to move, checkmate can be forced in at most ten moves from any starting position, with optimal play by both sides, but usually fewer moves are required. In positions in which a pawn has just promoted to a queen, at most nine moves are required.

In the position diagrammed, White checkmates easily by confining the black king to a rectangle and shrinking the rectangle to {{chessgloss|forcing move|force}} the king to the edge of the board:

Avoid stalemate
The winning side must be careful to not stalemate the opposing king, whereas the defender would like to get into such a position. There are five general types of stalemate positions that can occur, which the stronger side must avoid. The first two are more common.

The first diagram shows the basic checkmate position with a rook, which can occur on any edge of the board. The black king can be on any square on the edge of the board, the white king is in opposition to it, and the rook can check from any square on the rank or file (assuming that it cannot be captured). The second diagram shows a slightly different position where the kings are not in opposition but the defending king must be in a corner.

With the side with the rook to move, checkmate can be forced in at most sixteen moves from any starting position. Again, see for a demonstration of how the king and rook versus king mate is achieved.

In the third diagram position, White checkmates by confining the black king to a rectangle and shrinking the rectangle to force the king to the edge of the board:

===King and two bishops {{anchor|Two bishops}}===

The two bishops checkmate is the checkmate of a lone king by the opponent&#x27;s two bishops and king.{{efn|&quot;Against one knight or one bishop the defender cannot lose even if he wants to.&quot;{{sfn|Fine|1979|p=1}}}} 
The superior side is able to {{chessgloss|forced move|drive}} the lone king into a corner and {{chessgloss|forced mate|force mate}} using the two bishops and king collaboratively. The only stipulation is that the two bishops must move on opposite-colored squares.{{efn|Only an underpromotion can result in bishops on same-colored squares.}}{{sfn|Fine|1979|p=4|ps=, &quot;Two bishops of the same color cannot administer mate; a mating position is not even conceivable. The same holds true of nine (or more!) bishops all of one color.&quot;}} Accomplishing the mate requires a maximum of 19 moves.

|Checkmate via a side square adjacent to a corner square
{{col-end}}

The king and bishops cooperate to drive the enemy king to an edge of the board, and then into a corner to deliver the mate.{{sfn|Fine|1979|p=1}} &quot;The process, though a bit lengthy, is fascinating because it gives us a glimpse of the power of the two bishops on the open board.&quot;

Three basic checkmate positions are possible via the two bishops checkmate.{{sfn|Fine|1979|p=3}} The first is a checkmate in the corner. The second position is a checkmate on a side square next to the corner square (this position can theoretically occur anywhere along an edge, but can only be forced adjacent to a corner). With the side with the bishops to move, checkmate can be forced in at most nineteen moves, except in some very rare positions (0.03% of the possible positions). The third checkmate position is possible but not forceable.{{sfn|Fine|1979|p=3}}

It is not too difficult for two bishops to force checkmate, with the aid of their king. Two principles apply:
{{unordered list|style=list-style-position:inside
 |The bishops are best when they are near the {{chessgloss|center}} of the board and on adjacent diagonals. This cuts off the opposing king.
 |The king must be used aggressively, in conjunction with the bishops.

In the position from Seirawan, White wins by first forcing the black king to the side of the board, then to a corner, and then checkmates. It can be any side of the board and any corner. The process is:

:1. Ke2 Ke4 (Black tries to keep his king near the center) 2. Be3 Ke5 (forcing the king back, which is done often) 3. Kd3 Kd5 4. Bd4 Ke6 5. Ke4 Kd6 (Black tries a different approach to stay near the center) 6. Bc4 (White has a fine position; the bishops are centralized and the king is active) 6... Kc6 (Black avoids going toward the side) 7. Ke5 Kd7 (Black is trying to avoid the a8-corner) 8. Bd5 (keeping the black king off c6) 8... Kc7 9. Bc5 Kd7 10. Bd6! (an important move that forces the king to the edge of the board) 10... Ke8 (Black is still avoiding the corner) 11. Ke6 (now the black king cannot get off the edge of the board) 11... Kd8 12. Bc6 (forcing the king toward the corner) 12... Kc8 (Black&#x27;s king is confined to c8 and d8; the white king must cover a7 and b7) 13. Kd5 (13. Ke7{{chesspunc|?}} is stalemate) 13... Kd8 14. Kc5 Kc8 15. Kb6 Kd8 (now White must allow the king to move into the corner) 16. Bc5 Kc8 17. Be7! (an important move that forces the king toward the corner) 17... Kb8 18. Bd7! (the same principle as the previous move) 18... Ka8 19. Bd8 (White must make a move that gives up a tempo; this move is such a move, along with Bc5, Bf8, Be6, or Ka6) 19... Kb8 20. Bc7+ Ka8 21. Bc6# (as the first diagram in this section).

This is not the shortest forced checkmate from this position. Müller and Lamprecht give a fifteen-move solution; however, it contains an inaccurate move by Black (according to endgame tablebases).

Of the basic checkmates, this is the most difficult one to {{chessgloss|forced mate|force}}, because these two pieces cannot form a linear barrier to the enemy king from a distance. Also, the checkmate can be forced only in a corner that the bishop controls.
Two basic checkmate positions are shown with a bishop and a knight, or the bishop and knight checkmate. The first position is a checkmate by the bishop, with the black king in the corner. The bishop can be on other squares along the diagonal, the white king and knight have to be on squares that attack g8 and h7. The second position is a checkmate by the knight, with the black king on a side square next to the corner. The knight can be on other squares that check the black king. The white king must be on a square to protect the bishop and cover a square not covered by the knight.

With the side with the bishop and knight to move, checkmate can be forced in at most thirty-three moves from any starting position, except those in which the defending king is initially forking the bishop and knight and it is not possible to defend both. However, the mating process requires accurate play, since a few errors could result in a draw either by the fifty-move rule or stalemate.

Opinions differ as to whether or not a player should learn this checkmate procedure. James Howell omits the checkmate with two bishops in his book because it rarely occurs but includes the bishop and knight checkmate. Howell says that he has had it three times (always on the defending side) and that it occurs more often than the checkmate with two bishops. On the other hand, Jeremy Silman includes the checkmate with two bishops but not the bishop plus knight checkmate because he has had it only once and his friend John Watson has never had it. Silman says: &quot;... mastering it would take a significant chunk of time. Should the chess hopeful really spend many of his precious hours he&#x27;s put aside for chess study learning an endgame he will achieve (at most) only once or twice in his lifetime?&quot;

|After 1.Na3+?, 1...Kc1! draws.
This position is an example of a stalemate, from the end of a 1966 endgame study by A. H. Branton. White has just moved 1.Na3+? If Black moves 1...Kc1!, then White must move his bishop to save it because if the bishop is {{chessgloss|captured}}, the position is a draw because of the {{chessgloss|insufficient material}} rule. But after any bishop move, the position is a stalemate.

A back-rank checkmate is a checkmate delivered by a rook or queen along a back rank (that is, the row on which the pieces [not pawns] stand at the start of the game) in which the mated king is unable to move up the board because the king is blocked by friendly pieces (usually pawns) on the second rank. An example of a back-rank checkmate is shown in the diagram. It is also known as the &quot;corridor mate&quot;.

The scholar&#x27;s mate (also known as the four-move checkmate) is the checkmate achieved by the moves:

:1. 2. 3. 4. 

The moves might be played in a different order or in slight variation, but the basic idea is the same: the queen and bishop combine in a simple mating attack on f7 (or f2 if Black is performing the mate). There are also other ways to checkmate in four moves.

The fool&#x27;s mate, also known as the two-move checkmate, is the quickest possible checkmate. A prime example consists of the moves:

:1. 2. 

resulting in the position shown. (The pattern can have slight variations, for example White might play f4 instead of f3 or move the g-pawn first, and Black might play ...e6 instead of ...e5.)

===Smothered mate===
{{Main|Smothered mate}}


A smothered mate is a checkmate delivered by a knight in which the mated king is unable to move because it is surrounded (or &quot;smothered&quot;) by its own pieces.

The mate is usually seen in a corner of the board, since fewer pieces are needed to surround the king there. The most common form of smothered mate is seen in the adjacent diagram. The knight on f7 delivers mate to the king on h8 which is prevented from escaping the check by the rook on g8 and the pawns on g7 and h7. Similarly, White can be mated with the white king on h1 and the knight on f2. Analogous mates on a1 and a8 are rarer, because {{chessgloss|kingside}} castling is more common as it safely places the king closer to the corner compared to {{chessgloss|queenside}} castling.

==Rare checkmates==

In some rare positions it is possible to force checkmate with a king and knight versus a king and pawn.

===Unusual mates===
There are also positions in which a king and a knight can checkmate a king and a bishop, knight, or rook; or a king and a bishop can checkmate a king with a bishop on the other color of squares or with a knight, but the checkmate cannot be forced if there is no other material on the board (see the diagrams for some examples). Nevertheless, it keeps these {{chessgloss|material}} combinations from being ruled a draw because of &quot;insufficient mating material&quot; or &quot;impossibility of checkmate&quot; under the FIDE rules of chess. The U.S. Chess Federation rules are different. In a typical position with a {{chessgloss|minor piece}} versus a minor piece, a player would be able to claim a draw if they have a limited amount of time left.

It is impossible to &quot;force&quot; checkmate with a king and two knights, although checkmate positions are possible (see the first diagram). In the second diagram, if Black plays 1...Ka8{{chesspunc|??}} White can checkmate with 2.Nbc7#, but Black can play 1...Kc8 and escape the threat. The defender&#x27;s task is easy – they simply have to avoid moving into a position in which they can be checkmated on the next move, and they always have another move available in such situations.

In the third diagram, one knight is guarding c1, leaving the other knight to try to checkmate. After 1.Ndc3+ Ka1, White needs to get the knight on e2 to c2. But if White plays 2.Nd4, Black is stalemated.

Under some circumstances, two knights and a king can force checkmate against a king and pawn (or rarely more pawns). The winning plan, quite difficult to execute in practice, is to blockade the enemy pawn(s) with one of the knights, maneuver the enemy king into a stalemated position, then bring the other knight over to checkmate. (See Two knights endgame.)

;Three knights

Three knights and a king can force checkmate against a lone king within twenty moves (assuming that the lone king cannot quickly win a knight). These situations are generally only seen in chess problems, since at least one of the knights must be a promoted piece, and there is rarely a reason to promote a pawn to a piece other than a queen (see Underpromotion).

<doc id="456613" wikidata="Q3218057" url="?curid=456613" title="Larry Gonick">
<text>Larry Gonick (born 1946) is an American cartoonist best known for &quot;The Cartoon History of the Universe&quot;, a history of the world in comic book form, which he published in installments from 1977 to 2009. He has also written &quot;The Cartoon History of the United States&quot;, and he has adapted the format for a series of co-written guidebooks on other subjects, beginning with &quot;The Cartoon Guide to Genetics&quot; in 1983. The diversity of his interests, and the success with which his books have met, have together earned Gonick the distinction of being &quot;the most well-known and respected of cartoonists who have applied their craft to unravelling the mysteries of science&quot;.

==Early life ==
Gonick was born in 1946, in San Francisco, California. He studied mathematics at Harvard University, receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1967 and his master&#x27;s degree in 1969. He currently lives in San Francisco, California.

==Comic strips and cartoons==
From 1990 to 1997, Gonick penned a bimonthly &quot;Science Classics&quot; cartoon for the science magazine &quot;Discover&quot;. Each two-page comic discussed a recent scientific development, often one in interdisciplinary research.

During the 1994-95 academic year, Gonick was a Knight Science Journalism Fellow at MIT.

In 1997, his 14-issue series, &quot;Candide in China,&quot; published on the World Wide Web, described Chinese inventions.

He also used to write the &quot;Kokopelli &amp; Company&quot; comic that appeared in the magazine &quot;Muse&quot;.

He drew the satirical, anti-corporate comic &quot;Commoners&quot; for &quot;Common Ground&quot; and later explained: 
:Feeling alternately mournful and enraged about the shameless expropriation of public space, public enterprise, publicly held goods like the atmosphere, oceans, and rivers, not to mention roads, parks, sidewalks, genomes, and the broadcast spectrum—indeed the very idea of the common good—I decided to do something about it! Well, say something, anyway.

Between 2009 and 2011 Gonick drew a humorous webcomic entitled &quot;Raw Materials&quot; that deals with technology and business matters, especially database administration.

==Awards==
In 1999, Gonick was awarded the Inkpot Award.

<text>Turpan () or Turfan () is a prefecture-level city located in the east of the autonomous region of Xinjiang, China. It has an area of and a population of 693,988 (2020). The historical center of the prefectural area has shifted a number of times, from Yar-Khoto (Jiaohe, to the west of modern Turpan) to Qocho (Gaochang, to the southeast of Turpan) and to Turpan itself.

==Names==
Historically, many settlements in the Tarim Basin, being situated between Chinese, Turkic, Mongolian, and Persian language users, have a number of cognate names. Turpan or Turfan is one such example. The original name of the city is unknown. The form Turfan, while older than Turpan, was not used until the middle of the 2nd millennium CE and its use became widespread only in the post-Mongol period.

==History==

Turpan has long been the centre of a fertile oasis (with water provided by the &quot;karez&quot; canal system) and an important trade centre. It was historically located along the Silk Road. At that time, other kingdoms of the region included Korla and Yanqi.

Along with city-states such as Krorän (Loulan) and Kucha, Turpan has been inhabited by people speaking the Indo-European Tocharian languages up to at least the 8th century AD. Manuscripts from the 5th to the 8th century AD shows that the Tocharian A (Turfanian, Agnean, or East Tocharian; natively ārśi) of Qarašähär (ancient Agni, Chinese Yanqi and Sanskrit Agni) and Turpan (ancient Turfan and Xočo) was used in the region for administration and religious texts.

The Jushi Kingdom ruled the area in the 1st millennium BC, until it was conquered by the Chinese Han dynasty in 107 BC. It was subdivided into two kingdoms in 60 BC, between the Han and its enemy the Xiongnu Empire. The city changed hands several times between the Xiongnu and the Han, interspersed with short periods of independence. Nearer Jushi has been linked to the Turpan Oasis, while Further Jushi to the north of the mountains near modern Jimsar.

After the fall of the Han dynasty in 220, the region was virtually independent but tributary to various dynasties. Until the 5th century AD, the capital of this kingdom was Jiaohe (modern Yarghul west of Turpan).

Many Han Chinese along with Sogdians settled in Turfan during the post Han dynasty era. The Chinese character dominated Turfan in the eyes of the Sogdians. Kuchean speakers made up the original inhabitants before the Chinese and Sogdian influx. The oldest evidence of the use of Chinese characters was found in Turfan in a document dated to 273 AD.

In 327, the Gaochang Commandery (&quot;jùn&quot;) was created in the Turfan area by the Former Liang under Zhang Jun. The Chinese set up a military colony/garrison and organized the land into multiple divisions. Han Chinese colonists from the Hexi region and the central plains also settled in the region. Gaochang was successively ruled by the Former Liang, Former Qin and Northern Liang.

In 439, remnants of the Northern Liang, led by Juqu Wuhui and Juqu Anzhou, fled to Gaochang where they would hold onto power until 460 when they were conquered by the Rouran Khaganate.

===Gaochang Kingdom===

At the time of its conquest by the Rouran Khaganate, there were more than ten thousand Han Chinese households in Gaochang. The Rouran Khaganate, which was based in Mongolia, appointed a Han Chinese named Kan Bozhou to rule as King of Gaochang in 460, and it became a separate vassal kingdom of the Khaganate. Kan was dependent on Rouran backing. Yicheng and Shougui were the last two kings of the Chinese Kan family to rule Gaochang.

At this time the Gaoche was rising to challenge power of the Rouran in the Tarim Basin. The Gaoche king Afuzhiluo killed King Kan Shougui, who was the nephew of Kan Bozhou. and appointed a Han from Dunhuang, named Zhang Mengming (張孟明), as his own vassal King of Gaochang. Gaochang thus passed under Gaoche rule.

Later, Zhang Mengming was killed in an uprising by the people of Gaochang and replaced by Ma Ru (). In 501, Ma Ru himself was overthrown and killed, and the people of Gaochang appointed Qu Jia () from Jincheng Commandery as their king. Qu Jia at first pledged allegiance to the Rouran, but the Rouran khaghan was soon killed by the Gaoche and he had to submit to Gaoche overlordship. Later, when the Göktürks emerged as the supreme power in the region, the Qu dynasty of Gaochang became vassals of the Göktürks.

While the material civilization of Kucha to its west in this period remained chiefly Indo-Iranian in character, in Gaochang it gradually merged into the Tang aesthetics. Qu Wentai, King of Gaochang, was a main patron of the Tang pilgrim and traveller Xuanzang.

===Tang conquest===

The Tang dynasty had reconquered the Tarim Basin by the 7th century AD and for the next three centuries the Tibetan Empire, the Tang dynasty, and the Turks fought over dominion of the Tarim Basin. Sogdians and Chinese engaged in extensive commercial activities with each other under Tang rule. The Sogdians were mostly Mazdaist at this time. The Turpan region was renamed Xi Prefecture () when the Tang conquered it in 640 AD, had a history of commerce and trade along the Silk Road already centuries old; it had many inns catering to merchants and other travelers, while numerous brothels are recorded in Kucha and Khotan. According to Valerie Hansen, even before the Tang conquest, Han ethnic presence was already so extensive that the cultural alignment of the city led to Turpan&#x27;s name in the Sogdian language becoming known as &quot;Chinatown&quot; or &quot;Town of the Chinese&quot;. As late as the tenth century, the Persian source Hudud Al-Alam continued to refer to the town as Chīnanjkanth (Chinese town).

In Astana Cemetery, a contract written in Sogdian detailing the sale of a Sogdian girl to a Chinese man was discovered dated to 639 AD. Individual slaves were common among silk route houses; early documents recorded an increase in the selling of slaves in Turpan. Twenty-one 7th-century marriage contracts were found that showed, where one Sogdian spouse was present, for 18 of them their partner was a Sogdian. The only Sogdian men who married Chinese women were highly eminent officials. Several commercial interactions were recorded, for example a camel was sold priced at 14 silk bolts in 673, and a Chang&#x27;an native bought a girl age 11 for 40 silk bolts in 731 from a Sogdian merchant. Five men swore that the girl was never free before enslavement, since the Tang Code forbade commoners to be sold as slaves.

The Tang dynasty became weakened considerably due to the An Lushan Rebellion, and the Tibetans took the opportunity to expand into Gansu and the Western Regions. The Tibetans took control of Turfan in 792.


Clothing for corpses was made out of discarded, used paper in Turfan which is why the Astana graveyard is a source of a plethora of texts.

Seventh or 8th century dumplings and wontons were found in Turfan.

===Uyghur rule===
In 803, the Uyghurs of the Uyghur Khaganate seized Turfan from the Tibetans. The Uyghur Khaganate however was destroyed by the Kirghiz and its capital Ordu-Baliq in Mongolia sacked in 840. The defeat resulted in the mass movement of the Uyghurs out of Mongolia and their dispersal into Gansu and Central Asia, and many joined other Uyghurs already present in Turfan. In the early twentieth century, a collection of some 900 Christian manuscripts dating to the ninth to the twelfth centuries was found by the German Turfan expeditions at a monastery site at Turfan.

==== Idikut kingdom ====

The Uyghurs established a Kingdom in the Turpan region with its capital in Gaochang or Kara-Khoja. The kingdom was known as the Uyghuria Idikut state or Kara-Khoja Kingdom that lasted from 856 to 1389 AD. The Uyghurs were Manichaean but later converted to Buddhism and funded the construction of cave temples in the Bezeklik Caves. The Uyghurs formed an alliance with the rulers of Dunhuang. The Uyghur state later became a vassal state of the Kara-Khitans and then as a vassal of the Mongol Empire. This Kingdom was led by the Idikuts or Saint Spiritual Rulers. The last Idikut left Turpan area in 1284 for Kumul and then Gansu to seek protection of the Yuan dynasty, but local Uyghur Buddhist rulers still held power until the invasion by the Moghul Khizr Khoja in 1389.

====Turfan expeditions====
German scientists conducted archaeological expeditions, known as the German Turfan expeditions, at the beginning of the 20th century (between 1902 and 1914). They discovered paintings and other art treasures that were transported to the Museum of Asian Art in Berlin.

Artifacts of Manichaean and Buddhist provenance were also found in Turfan. During World War II, many of these artifacts were destroyed or looted.

====Turfan fragments====
Uyghur, Persian, Sogdian and Syriac documents have been found in Turfan. Turfan also has documents in Middle Persian.

All these are known as the Turfan fragments. They comprise a collection of over 40,000 manuscripts and manuscript fragments in 16 different languages and 26 different typefaces in different book forms. They are in the custody of the Berlin State Library where their study continues.

These writings deal with Buddhist as well as Christian-Nestorian, Manichaean and secular contents. The approximately 8,000 Old Turkic Buddhist texts make up the largest part of this.

A whole series of Sogdian Buddhist scriptures were found in Turpan (and also in Dunhuang), but these date from the Tang dynasty (618–907) and are translations from Chinese. Earlier Sogdian Buddhist texts could not be found.

Christian texts exist mainly in Syriac and Sogdian, but also as Syriac-Sogdian bilinguals (bilingual texts), as well as some Turkish-Nestorian fragments. They include fragments of Sogdian translations of works by Isaac the Syrian.

Manichaean texts survive in Middle Persian, Parthian, Sogdian and Uyghur; the Sogdian and Uyghur documents show a notable adaptation to Buddhism, but there is also evidence of a reverse influence.

Important parts of the Gospel of Mani were found here, for example. Also, parts of the Arzhang (Book of Pictures), one of the holy books of Manichaeism were discovered.

Most of the Buddhist texts survive in only fragmentary form. There are several Indian Sanskrit texts from various schools of Mahayana and Hinayana, Uyghur texts that are mostly translations from Sanskrit, Tocharian and, starting in the 9th century, increasingly from the Chinese.

Many of the Uyghur documents and fragments of Buddhist scriptures edited to date include didactic texts (sutras) and philosophical works (the abhidharma). In contrast to the other Buddhist contents, the monastic discipline texts (the vinaya) did not seem to be translated, but rather taught and studied in Sanskrit.

===Conversion to Islam===
The conversion of the local Buddhist population to Islam was completed in the second half of the 15th century.

After being converted, the descendants of the previously Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the &quot;infidel Kalmuks&quot; (Dzungars) were the ones who built Buddhist monuments in their area.

===15th and 16th centuries===
Buddhist images and temples in Turfan were described in 1414 by the Ming diplomat Chen Cheng.

As late as 1420, the Timurid envoy Ghiyāth al-dīn Naqqāsh, who passed through Turpan on the way from Herat to Beijing, reported that many of the city&#x27;s residents were &quot;infidels&quot;. He visited a &quot;very large and beautiful&quot; temple with a statue of Shakyamuni; in one of the versions of his account it was also claimed that many Turpanians &quot;worshipped the cross&quot;.
The Moghul ruler of Turpan Yunus Khan, also known as Ḥājjī &#x27;Ali (ruled 1462–1478), unified Moghulistan (roughly corresponding to today&#x27;s Eastern Xinjiang) under his authority in 1472. Around that time, a conflict with the Ming China started over the issues of tribute trade: Turpanians benefited from sending &quot;tribute missions&quot; to China, which allowed them to receive valuable gifts from the Ming emperors and to do plenty of trading on the side; the Chinese, however, felt that receiving and entertaining these missions was just too expensive. (Muslim envoys to the early Ming China were impressed by the lavish reception offered to them along their route through China, from Suzhou to Beijing, such as described by Ghiyāth al-dīn Naqqāsh in 1420–1421.)

Yunus Khan was irritated by the restrictions on the frequency and size of Turpanian missions (no more than one mission in 5 years, with no more than 10 members) imposed by the Ming government in 1465 and by the Ming&#x27;s refusal to bestow sufficiently luxurious gifts on his envoys (1469). Accordingly, in 1473 he went to war against China, and succeeded in capturing Hami in 1473 from the Oirat Mongol Henshen and holding it for a while, until Ali was repulsed by the Ming dynasty into Turfan. He reoccupied Hami after Ming left. Henshen&#x27;s Mongols recaptured Hami twice in 1482 and 1483, but the son of Ali, Ahmad Alaq, who ruled Eastern Moghulistan or Turpan Khanate, reconquered it in 1493 and captured the Hami leader and the resident of China in Hami (Hami was a vassal state to Ming). In response, the Ming dynasty imposed an economic blockade on Turfan and kicked out all the Uyghurs from Gansu. It became so harsh for Turfan that Ahmed left. Ahmed&#x27;s son Mansur succeeded him and took over Hami in 1517. These conflicts were called the Ming–Turpan conflict.

Several times, after occupying Hami, Mansur tried to attack China in 1524 with 20,000 men, but was beaten by Chinese forces. The Turpan kingdom under Mansur, in alliance with Oirat Mongols, tried to raid Suzhou in Gansu in 1528, but were severely defeated by Ming Chinese forces and suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese refused to lift the economic blockade and restrictions that had led to the battles and continued restricting Turpan&#x27;s tribute and trade with China. Turfan also annexed Hami.

===18th and 19th centuries===
The Imin mosque of Turfan was built in 1779.

Francis Younghusband visited Turpan in 1887 on his overland journey from Beijing to India. He said it consisted of two walled towns, a Chinese one with a population of no more than 5,000 and, about a mile (1.6 km) to the west, a Turk town of &quot;probably&quot; 12,000 to 15,000 inhabitants. The town (presumably the &quot;Turk town&quot;) had four gateways, one for each of the cardinal directions, of solid brickwork and massive wooden doors plated with iron and covered by a semicircular bastion. The well-kept walls were of mud and about 35 ft (10.7 m) tall and 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 m) thick, with loopholes at the top. There was a level space about 15 yards (14 m) wide outside the main walls surrounded by a musketry wall about 8 ft (2.4 m) high, with a ditch around it some 12 ft (3.7 m) deep and 20 ft (6 m) wide. There were drumtowers over the gateways, small square towers at the corners and two small square bastions between the corners and the gateways, &quot;two to each front&quot;. Wheat, cotton, poppies, melons and grapes were grown in the surrounding fields.

Turpan grapes impressed other travelers to the region as well. The 19th-century Russian explorer Grigory Grum-Grshimailo, thought the local raisins may be &quot;the best in the world&quot; and noted the buildings of a &quot;perfectly peculiar design&quot; used for drying them called chunche.

Mongols, Chinese and Chantos all lived in Turfan during this period.

===20th and 21st centuries===
In 1931, a Uyghur rebellion broke out in the region, after a Chinese commander tried to forcibly marry a local girl. The Chinese responded by indiscriminately attacking Muslims; this turned the entire countryside against the Chinese administration and the Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and Tungans joined the rebels.

On 19 August 1981, Deng Xiaoping conducted an inspection in Turpan Prefecture.

On 31 March 1995, Turpan and Dunhuang became sister cities.

== Geography ==
=== Subdivisions ===
Turpan directly controls one district and two counties.


Turpan is located about southeast of Ürümqi, Xinjiang&#x27;s capital, in a mountain basin, on the northern side of the Turpan Depression, at an elevation of above sea level. Outside of Turpan is a small volcanic cone, the Turfan volcano, that is said to have erupted in 1120 as described in the Song dynasty. In June 1995, a book of standard names for local geography was published.

=== Climate ===
Turpan has an extremely continental desert climate (Köppen Climate Classification &quot;BWk&quot;. Trewartha &quot;BWho&quot;), with long, extremely hot summers (resembling a hot desert climate or &quot;BWh&quot;) and somewhat short but very cold winters, with very brief spring and autumn in between. Annual precipitation is very low, amounting to only . The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, or a very large seasonal variation of ; the annual mean is . With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 48% in December to 75% in September, sunshine is abundant and the city receives 2,912 hours of bright sunshine annually.

Extremes have ranged from to with Sanbao to its east having recorded a national all time record high for China at , although a reading of in July 1975 is regarded as dubious.
However, the high heat and dryness of the summer, when combined with the area&#x27;s ancient system of irrigation, allows the countryside around Turpan to produce great quantities of high-quality fruit.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2015 government census, the city of Turpan had a population of 651,853 (population density 15.99 inh./km2). Islam is largest religion. The breakdown by ethnicity was as follows:

=== Language ===
There is Chinese influence in the vocabulary of Uyghur dialect in Turpan.

=== Assimilation ===
Turpan Uyghurs have more Han Chinese features and looks than Uyghurs elsewhere and this is suggested to be due to intermarriage between Han Chinese and Uyghurs in the past according to the locals. Due to physical features found in Uyghurs in Turpan it was claimed that Uyghurs married slaves sent to Turpan&#x27;s Lukchun area by the Qing according to the Manchu Ji Dachun.

== Economy ==
Turpan is an agricultural economy growing vegetables, cotton, and especially grapes being China&#x27;s largest raisin producing area. There is a steady increase in farming acreage devoted to grapes backed by strong local government support for increased production. The local government has coordinated improvements in raisin distribution, offered preferential loans for grape cultivation, and free management training to growers. The annual Turpan Grape festival includes a mass wedding of Uyghurs funded by the government.

== Transport ==

Turpan is served by the Lanzhou–Xinjiang High-Speed Railway through the Turpan North Railway Station. Turpan Railway Station is the junction for two conventional lines, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang and the Southern Xinjiang Railways.

China National Highway 312 passes through Turpan.

The Tulufan Jiaohe Airport is close to Turpan North Railway Station.

==Attractions==
Turpan is home to one of several caves associated with the pious Christian and Muslim legend of the Seven Sleepers.

<text>Kofi Awoonor (born George Kofi Nyidevu Awoonor-Williams; 13 March 1935 – 21 September 2013) was a Ghanaian poet, author and diplomat. His work combined the poetic traditions of his native Ewe people with contemporary and religious symbolism to depict Africa during decolonization. He started writing under the name George Awoonor-Williams, and was also published as Kofi Nyidevu Awoonor. He taught African literature at the University of Ghana. Professor Awoonor was among those who were killed in the September 2013 attack at Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya, where he was a participant at the Storymoja Hay Festival.

==Early life==
George Kofi Nyidevu Awoonor-Williams was born in Wheta, in the Volta region of what was then the Gold Coast, present-day Ghana. He was the eldest of 10 children in the family. He was a paternal descendant of the Awoonor-Williams family of Sierra Leone Creole descent. His grandmother was an Ewe dirge singer. 

== Education ==
He attended Achimota School and then proceeded to the University of Ghana, graduating in 1960. While at university he wrote his first poetry book, &quot;Rediscovery&quot;, published in 1964. Like the rest of his work, &quot;Rediscovery&quot; is rooted in African oral poetry. His early works were inspired by the singing and verse of his native Ewe people, and he later published translations of the work of three Ewe dirge singers (&quot;Guardians of the Sacred Word: Ewe Poetry&quot;, 1973).

He studied literature at University College London, earning a Master&#x27;s Degree in 1970. He got his Ph.D. at SUNY at Stony Brook, in New York in 1972.

== Career ==
After graduating in 1960, Awoonor worked as a researcher for the Institute for African Studies and began participating in the pan-African campaigns of Kwame Nkrumah. He was appointed to the Ghana Film Corporation. He helped to found the Ghana Playhouse, where he played the lead role in Wole Soyinka&#x27;s &quot;The Lion and the Jewel&quot;. In the 1960s, he edited the literary journal &quot;Okyeame&quot; and was an associate editor of &quot;Transition Magazine&quot;.

While in England, he wrote several radio plays for the BBC, and began using the name Kofi Awoonor.

He spent the early 1970s in the United States, studying and teaching at Stony Brook University (then called SUNY at Stony Brook) where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1972. While in the United States he wrote &quot;This Earth, My Brother&quot; and &quot;Night of My Blood&quot;, both books published in 1971.

Awoonor returned to Ghana in 1975 as head of the English department at the University of Cape Coast. Within months he was arrested for helping a soldier accused of trying to overthrow the military government and was imprisoned without trial. His sentence was remitted in October 1976. &quot;The House by the Sea&quot; (1978) is about his time in jail. 

Awoonor was Ghana&#x27;s ambassador to Brazil from 1984 to 1988, before serving as ambassador to Cuba. From 1990 to 1994, Awoonor was Ghana&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, where he headed the committee against apartheid. He was also a former Chairman of the Council of State, the main advisory body to the president of Ghana, serving in that position from 2009 to January 2013.

== Poetry ==
The early poetry of Awoonor borrows from the Ewe oral tradition. In his critical book Guardians of the &quot;Sacred Word and Ewe Poetry&quot;, he rendered Ewe poetry in translation &quot;(1974)&quot;. &quot;The Breast of the Earth: A Study of the History, Culture, and Literature of Africa South of the Sahara is another work of literary criticism (1975).&quot;

== Death ==
On 21 September 2013, Awoonor was among those killed in an attack at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi. He was in Kenya as a participant in the Storymoja Hay Festival, a four-day celebration of writing, thinking and storytelling, at which he was due to perform on the evening of his death. His nephew Nii Parkes, who was attending the same literary festival, has written about meeting him for the first time that day. The Ghanaian government confirmed Awoonor&#x27;s death the next day. His son Afetsi Awoonor, who had accompanied him, was also shot, but was later discharged from hospital.

Awoonor&#x27;s remains were flown from Nairobi to Accra, Ghana, on 25 September 2013.

His body was cremated and buried at a particular spot in his hometown at Wheta in the Volta Region. Also there was no crying or mourning at his funeral all according to his will before death.

==Understanding and interpreting his works==

It is said that Awoonor wrote a great number of his poems as if he was envisioning his own demise.
But he is a peculiar and unique writer, one who strives, almost too hard, to bring his ancestry and culture into his poems, sometimes even borrowing words from the local Ewe dialect.
Being such a strong and avid practitioner of the traditional religion meant that he was of a relict species. Especially for one so highly educated, it was an even rarer phenomenon.
That awareness, not only that he was a relict specimen as an individual, but that the entire culture was suffering entropy, may have come through his poems in a manner that would suggest at first that he was writing about his mortal end.
Besides the personal and cultural lament, Awoonor also shrewdly decried what he would have considered the decadent spectre of Western influences (religions, social organisation and economic philosophy) on the history and fortunes of African people in general. He would lambast the thoughtless exuberance with which Africans themselves embraced such things, and gradually engineered what he would have considered a self-degradation that went far beyond a loss of cultural identity. He would often construct his writings to look at these things through the lens of his own Ewe culture.

<text>Kryptos is a sculpture by the American artist Jim Sanborn located on the grounds of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) headquarters, the George Bush Center for Intelligence in Langley, Virginia.

Since its dedication on November 3, 1990, there has been much speculation about the meaning of the four encrypted messages it bears. Of these four messages, the first three have been solved, while the fourth message remains one of the most famous unsolved codes in the world. It is said that a fifth message will reveal itself after the first four are solved. The sculpture continues to be of interest to cryptanalysts, both amateur and professional, who are attempting to decipher the fourth passage. The artist has so far given four clues to this passage.

== Description ==

The sculpture comprises four large copper plates with other elements consisting of water, wood, plants, red and green granite, white quartz, and petrified wood. The most prominent feature of the entire part is a large vertical &quot;S&quot;-shaped copper screen resembling a scroll or a piece of paper emerging from a computer printer, half of which consists of encrypted text, that is located in the northwest corner of the New Headquarters Building courtyard, outside of the agency&#x27;s cafeteria. The characters are all found within the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, along with question marks, and are cut out of the copper plates. The main sculpture contains four separate enigmatic messages, three of which have been deciphered.

In addition to the main part of the sculpture, Sanborn also placed other pieces of art on the CIA grounds, such as several large granite slabs with sandwiched copper sheets outside the entrance to the New Headquarters Building. Several Morse code messages are found on these copper sheets, and one of the stone slabs has an engraving of a compass rose pointing to a lodestone. The ciphers&#x27; increasing &quot;complexity&quot; through the entrance into the courtyard is intended to be as if it &quot;were a fossil&quot;. Other elements of Sanborn&#x27;s installation include a landscaped garden area, a fish pond with opposing wooden benches, a reflecting pool, and other pieces of stone, including a triangle-shaped black stone slab.

The name &quot;Kryptos&quot; comes from the ancient Greek word for &quot;hidden&quot;, and the theme of the sculpture is &quot;intelligence gathering&quot;. The cost of building the sculpture in 1988 was (worth ~ in 2024).

== Encrypted messages ==
The ciphertext on the left-hand side of the sculpture (as seen from the courtyard) of the main sculpture contains 869 characters in total: 865 letters and 4 question marks. In April 2006, Sanborn released information stating that a letter was omitted from this side of &quot;Kryptos&quot; &quot;for aesthetic reasons, to keep the sculpture visually balanced&quot;. There are also three misspelled words in the plaintext of the deciphered first three passages, which Sanborn has said was intentional, and three letters (&quot;YAR&quot;) near the beginning of the bottom half of the left side are the only characters on the sculpture in superscript.

The right-hand side of the sculpture comprises a keyed Vigenère encryption tableau, consisting of 867 letters. One of the lines of the Vigenère tableau has an extra character (&quot;L&quot;). Bauer, Link, and Molle suggest that this may be a reference to the Hill cipher as an encryption method for the fourth passage of the sculpture. However, Sanborn omitted the extra letter from the small &quot;Kryptos&quot; models that he sold.

Sanborn worked with a retiring CIA employee named Edward Scheidt to come up with the cryptographic systems used on the sculpture. Edward Scheidt stated that the difficulty of the encryption was around nine out of ten. He said that his intention was for it to be solved in five to ten years. He also said that there was an intentional &quot;change in the methodology&quot; of the encryption. Sanborn has also stated that should he die before the entire sculpture is deciphered, someone should be able to confirm the solution. In 2020, Sanborn stated that he planned to put the secret to the solution up for auction once he died.

Sanborn had stated that the sculpture contains a riddle within a riddle, which will be solvable only after the four encrypted passages have been deciphered. He has given conflicting information about the sculpture&#x27;s answer, saying at one time that he gave the complete solution to the then-CIA director William Webster during the dedication ceremony, but later, he also said that he had not given Webster the entire solution. He did, however, confirm that a passage of the plaintext of the second message reads, &quot;Who knows the exact location? Only WW.&quot;

== Solvers ==
The first person to announce publicly that he had solved the first three passages was Jim Gillogly, a computer scientist from southern California, who deciphered these passages using a computer, and revealed his solutions in 1999. After Gillogly&#x27;s announcement, the CIA revealed that their analyst David Stein had solved the same passages in 1998 using pencil and paper techniques, although at the time of his solution the information was only disseminated within the intelligence community. No public announcement was made until July 1999, although in November 1998 it was revealed that &quot;a CIA analyst working on his own time [had] solved &#x27;the lion&#x27;s share&#x27; of it&quot;.

The NSA claimed that some of their employees had solved the same three passages but would not reveal names or dates until March 2000, when it was learned that an NSA team led by Ken Miller, along with Dennis McDaniels and two other unnamed individuals, had solved passages1–3 in late 1992. In 2013, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Elonka Dunin, the NSA released documents that show these attempts to solve the &quot;Kryptos&quot; puzzle in 1992, following a challenge by Bill Studeman, then Deputy Director of the CIA. The documents show that by June 1993, a small group of NSA cryptanalysts had succeeded in solving the first three passages of the sculpture.

All previous attempts to solve &quot;Kryptos&quot; found that passage 2 ended with &quot;WESTIDBYROWS&quot;. However, in 2005, Nicole Friedrich, a logician from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, determined that another possible plaintext was &quot;WESTXLAYERTWO&quot;. On April 19, 2006, Sanborn contacted an online community dedicated to the &quot;Kryptos&quot; puzzle to inform them that he made an error in the sculpture by omitting an &quot;S&quot; in the ciphertext (an &quot;X&quot; in the plaintext), and he confirmed that the last passage of the plaintext was &quot;WESTXLAYERTWO&quot;, and not &quot;WESTIDBYROWS&quot;.

The question with which it ends is asked by Lord Carnarvon, to which Carter in the book replied, &quot;wonderful things&quot;. Field notes from the expedition, however, show his reply as, &quot;Yes, it is wonderful&quot;.

== Clues given for passage4 ==

When commenting in 2006 about his error in passage2, Sanborn said that the answers to the first three passages contain clues to the fourth passage. In November 2010, Sanborn released a clue, publicly stating that &quot;NYPVTT&quot;, the 64th–⁠69th letters in passage4, become &quot;BERLIN&quot; after decryption.

Sanborn gave &quot;The New York Times&quot; another clue in November 2014: the letters &quot;MZFPK&quot;, the 70th–⁠74th letters in passage4, become &quot;CLOCK&quot; after decryption. The 74th letter is &quot;K&quot; in both the plaintext and ciphertext, meaning that it is possible for a character to encrypt to itself. Sanborn further stated that in order to solve passage4, &quot;You&#x27;d better delve into that particular clock&quot;, but added, &quot;There are several really interesting clocks in Berlin.&quot; The particular clock in question is presumably the Berlin Clock, although the Alexanderplatz World Clock and Clock of Flowing Time are other candidates.

In an article published on January 29, 2020, by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Sanborn gave another clue: at positions 26–34, ciphertext &quot;QQPRNGKSS&quot; is the word &quot;NORTHEAST&quot;.

In August 2020, Sanborn revealed that the four letters in positions 22–25, ciphertext &quot;FLRV&quot;, in the plaintext are &quot;EAST&quot;. Sanborn commented that he &quot;released this layout to several people as early as April&quot;.

== Related sculptures ==
After producing &quot;Kryptos&quot;, Sanborn&#x27;s first cryptographic sculpture, he went on to make several other sculptures with codes, including an &quot;Untitled Kryptos Piece&quot; and &quot;Cyrillic Projector&quot;, which contain encrypted Russian Cyrillic text that includes an extract from a classified KGB document. The cipher on one side of Sanborn&#x27;s 1997 sculpture &quot;Antipodes&quot; repeats part of the text from &quot;Kryptos&quot; with slight differences.

== In popular culture ==
The dust jacket of the US version of Dan Brown&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; contains two references to &quot;Kryptos&quot;—one on the back cover (coordinates printed light red on dark red, vertically next to the blurbs) is a reference to the coordinates mentioned in the plaintext of passage2, except the degree digit is off by one. When Brown and his publisher were asked about this, they both gave the same reply: &quot;The discrepancy is intentional&quot;. The coordinates were part of the first clue of the second &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; WebQuests, with the first answer being &quot;Kryptos&quot;. The other reference is hidden in the brown &quot;tear&quot; artwork—the upside-down text &quot;Only WW knows&quot; is another reference to the second message on &quot;Kryptos&quot;. &quot;Kryptos&quot; was also featured in another of Dan Brown&#x27;s novels, &quot;The Lost Symbol&quot; (2009).

A small version of &quot;Kryptos&quot; appears in the season 5 episode of &quot;Alias&quot; &quot;S.O.S.&quot;. In it, Marshall Flinkman says he has cracked the code just by looking at it during a tour visit to the CIA office. The solution he describes sounds like the solution to the first two parts. It was also mentioned as &quot;Kryptos Donuts&quot; in the sixth episode of &quot;The Recruit&quot; Season 1, &quot;I.N.A.S.I.A.L.&quot;.

<text>Zarlink Semiconductor (acquired by Microsemi in October 2011, itself acquired by Microchip in March 2018) was a fabless semiconductor company specializing in the design and manufacture of communication and medical semiconductor integrated circuits, modules, and other devices. In 2011, Microsemi acquired Zarlink in a hostile takeover and merged it into its own operations.

In its last years as an independent entity, the company&#x27;s core capabilities were in network timing, voice enhancement and ultra low-power wireless communication. Its head offices were located in Ottawa, Canada. Zarlink sold products to 3,000 customers in more than 100 countries. In 2011, it had approximately 500 employees worldwide, including in development centres in Canada and the U.S., and specialized fabrication facilities in Wales. Essentially all of its manufacturing was done off-shore through subcontracting partners.

==History==
===Early history===
Zarlink was part of Mitel Corporation which was founded by Terry Matthews and Michael Cowpland in 1973. In 1982 the company developed the industry&#x27;s first T1/E1 framer chip and later introduced the industry&#x27;s first echo cancellation chip in 1996.

In 1998, Mitel acquired GEC-Plessey Semiconductor in the UK from the General Electric Company for US $225 million in cash, through which it gained wireless technology and communications ASIC and systems integration expertise, including RF (Radio Frequency) technology. The combined semiconductor businesses at the time ranked Mitel among the top ten networking companies in the world.

===21st century===
By 2000, the semiconductor and PBX divisions had combined annual revenues of USD $1.4 billion. However the semiconductor business was experiencing significant growth while the PBX division grew more slowly in the face of competition from Cisco, Avaya and other significant players.

===PBX division===
With Kirk Mandy as CEO and President, Mitel in 2001 sold its PBX division back to Terry Matthews along with the Mitel name for CDN $300 million. The PBX division had growth of 5-6% annually while the semiconductor division had been growing at 45-47%. Soon after, Mandy retired and was replaced by a management team drawn mainly from National Semiconductor.

===Division renamed===
The semiconductor division was renamed Zarlink to reflect its interest in networking. It derives either from the Latin word &quot;Caesar&quot; or Russian word &quot;Tsar&quot; meaning &quot;one having great power or authority&quot; and the word &quot;link&quot; which means &quot;to connect or be connected&quot;. With the sale Zarlink became a pure play semiconductor company focused on specialized markets. Over time it became virtually fabless by selling essentially all of its fabrication plants and other manufacturing facilities to third parties and outsourcing the bulk of its production.

===Foundry===
In 2002 Zarlink sold its foundry in Bromont, Quebec, Canada to Dalsa Corporation, and its wafer fabrication facility in Plymouth, UK to X-FAB Semiconductor Foundries AG. In the same year, the company unveiled the industry&#x27;s first high-density CESoP (Circuit Emulation Services-over-Packet) packet processor to allow service providers to carry TDM traffic over IP networks.

In 2003 it significantly expanded its timing portfolio to offer a comprehensive range of digital, analog and module synchronization products. With worsening economic conditions globally Zarlink implemented several workforce reductions while trying to widely diversify the company&#x27;s product portfolio. This strategy proved to be unsuccessful. Mandy returned to head up the company in 2003. In the following years there were several additional workforce reductions and non-core assets were sold off.

===RF Front-End===
In 2005 it announced the sale of its RF Front-End consumer business to Intel and in 2006 the sale of its Packet Switching product group to Conexant Systems.

In 2004 one of Zarlink&#x27;s RF transmitters was used in a swallowable camera capsule by Given Image. The chip was produced by X-Fab and transmits two movie-quality images per second from the capsule, allowing a more thorough and non-invasive examination of the gastrointestinal tract. In 2009 the company announced that it had shipped over one million RF chips for use in Given Imaging&#x27;s PillCam SB video capsules.

===Transceiver chip===
In 2005 Zarlink introduced the ZL70100 ultra low-power transceiver chip that met the Medical Device Radiocommunications Service standard of the FCC and the ETSI, used to link implanted medical devices and base stations. In 2008 the ZL70101 won an EE Times Product of the Year award. In the same year the company announced that it had already shipped over 30,000 modules incorporating the chip to St. Jude Medical for use in implanted defibrillators. The chip and module is being designed into a variety of medical implantable devices and external instruments such as pacemakers, defibrillators, and devices used to treat dystonia, acute pain, parkinsons, epilepsy, and other advanced monitoring, diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

In June 2007 Zarlink acquired Legerity, a privately held former division of AMD, headquartered in Austin, Texas for US$134.5 million in cash. Legerity was a supplier of analog voice technologies for carrier, enterprise and residential gateway equipment.

===Analog foundry===
In February 2008, it sold an unprofitable analog foundry in Swindon, United Kingdom and successfully defended itself against a dissident shareholder battle led by a 5 percent stakeholder accusing Zarlink of overspending on R&amp;D.

===Implant project===
Zarlink announced a Zarlink-led Self-Energizing Implantable Medical Microsystem (SIMM) project which successfully designed and tested an in-body microgenerator that will harvest energy from the heartbeat to power implanted medical devices. In 2009 the project was named winner of the Emerging Technology Award at the Institution of Engineering and Technology&#x27;s (IET) Innovation Awards in London, England.

===Late history===
In May 2010 it sold its Optical Products Group in Sweden and Phoenix and set its focus on its timing, synchronization, medical and line circuit businesses. In September 2010 it sold a campus located in Järfälla, Sweden for US$16M to a company affiliated with the Stendorren group in Stockholm.

Following the Legerity acquisition Zarlink significantly reduced its manufacturing costs, made changes to its management team (including the appointment of Garry Tanner to CEO, formerly COO at Legerity), launched three new technology platforms (one for each of its businesses) and aggressively drove the company&#x27;s finances forward. Fiscal 2011 operating income reached $39 million up from $19 million the previous year and net income reached $69 million, up from $7 million in 2011. In 2011 revenues from its timing and synchronization business grew by 38% while its voice telephony business grew by 34%. The company&#x27;s share price rose tenfold compared to March 2009, and it roughly doubled its cash and cash equivalents to $124 million at the end of the first quarter, from $62 million a year earlier. Its revenues reached $220 million in fiscal 2011 and profits grew eightfold.

===Takeover===
Zarlink&#x27;s turnaround attracted several supposedly &quot;unsolicited&quot; offers by Microsemi, an $800 million company. After being rebuffed Microsemi was forced to improve its valuation of the company. In reaction to the increased offers Zarlink&#x27;s Board launched a strategic alternatives review process. In October, 2011 Microsemi agreed to acquire Zarlink for $3.98 a share, a nearly 70% premium over its trading price, for a total consideration of over USD $630 million.

<text>Agnita (; ; Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Ongenîtlen&quot;; ) is a town on the Hârtibaciu river in Sibiu County, Transylvania, central Romania. It is considered the locality in the center of the country. The town administers two villages, namely Coveș (; ) and Ruja (; ).

== Demographics ==

The population was 8,300 at the 2011 census, of which 94.2% were Romanians, 2.9% Hungarians, 1.5% Roma, and 1% Germans (more specifically Transylvanian Saxons).

== History ==

The first document mentioning it is a land sale contract signed in 1280 by one Henric from &quot;Sancta Agatha&quot;. In 1376, Louis I of Hungary granted to the village the right to hold a market. In 1466, Matthias Corvinus granted to the village the right to carry trials (&quot;jus gladi&quot;) and built a fortress to defend the Kingdom of Hungary from the Ottoman Empire.

Agnita, mentioned for the first time in a document from 1280, is a town with traditional crafts, famous for the old guilds of tanners, shoemakers, tailors, coopers and potters, with semi-rural economy.

Here is one of the oldest peasant fortification in Transylvania. Initiated in the thirteenth century, it was amplified successively came to be in the seventeenth century, three fortified enclosure with towers. The city center is a church-hall with three ships (naves with stands) and turn west (XV around the year 1409). In turn strengthened the church has undergone many transformations. The four towers of the fortified church - the shoemakers, tailors, blacksmiths and coopers - demonstrates the economic strength of these guilds, and were assigned to the defense that those portions of the wall in case of armed conflict. City Museum has a substantial collection of medieval art (Gothic chests, architecture, sculpture, ceramics, etc.).

King of Hungary, Louis of Anjou, conferred Agnita (or villa Zenthagata) since 1376, the right to hold an annual fair on 24 June (day of St. John). Subsequently, this right was extended to two other fairs. In 1466, a Hungarian king granted the town Agnita right &quot;ius Gladiator&quot;, i.e., the right to decide and execute the death sentence. In the same year, the village was allowed to keep half of the contingent settlement of royal troops to defend their own city to the church from falling into foreign hands, since it was near the frontier into Wallachia. Until 1950, when the city was declared, there was a common Agnita fair (Marktgemeinde).

The railway was built in 1898 from Sighișoara to the terminus at Agnita railway station and further extended to Sibiu in 1910 with a station at Coveș. However, by 1965 the route was curtailed at Agnita with the closure of the line north including the section through the town. As a result, a new station was built in the west; however, in 2001 this too was closed. The line is a historic monument and there is an active movement to restore the entire line.

<doc id="456631" wikidata="Q685912" url="?curid=456631" title="Junkers Ju 287">
<text>The Junkers Ju 287 was a multi-engine tactical jet bomber built in Nazi Germany in 1944. It featured a novel forward-swept wing, and the first two prototypes (which were aerodynamic testbeds for the production Ju 287) were among the very few jet propelled aircraft ever built with fixed landing gear.

==Development==
The Ju 287 was intended to provide the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; with a bomber that could avoid interception by outrunning enemy fighters. The swept-forward wing was suggested by the project&#x27;s head designer Dr. Hans Wocke as a way of providing extra lift at low airspeeds—necessary because of the poor responsiveness of early turbojets at the vulnerable times of takeoff and landing. A further structural advantage of the forward-swept wing was that it would allow for a single massive weapons bay in the best location, the centre of gravity of the plane, with the main wing spar passing behind the bomb bay. The same structural requirement meant the wing could then be located at the best aerodynamic location, the centre of the fuselage. Prior to the assembly of the first Ju 287, an He 177 A-3 (designated as an He 177 prototype, V38) was modified at the Letov plant in Prague to examine the technical characteristics of this single large bomb bay design.

The first and second prototypes (Ju 287 V1 and V2; both designated Ju 288 V201 and Ju 288 V202 for security reasons) were intended to evaluate the concept, with V1 being intended to test the FSW and V2 being earmarked for evaluating flight at high subsonic speeds, and both were assembled from the fuselages of the He 177 A-3, the tail of the Ju 188G-2, main undercarriage and nosewheels taken from shot-down B-24 Liberators, all of which were fixed to lower weight and complexity, and equipped with spats to reduce drag. The fixed undercarriage was used as the wing box couldn&#x27;t have cutouts for wheel stowage which would reduce wing torsion box stiffness required for the forward sweep design. Later prototypes with higher power engines and higher top speed would have the undercarriage stowage in the centre fuselage sides. Two of the Jumo 004 engines were hung in nacelles (pods) under the wings, with the other two mounted in nacelles added to the sides of the forward fuselage. The Ju 287 had been initially intended to be powered by four Heinkel-Hirth HeS 011 engines, but because of the development problems experienced with that engine, the BMW 003 was selected in its place. The second prototype (Junkers Ju 287 V2) would have had six engines (originally four underwing BMW 003s and two fuselage-mounted Jumo 004s, but later changed to two triple clusters composed of four Jumo 004s and two BMW 003s), and also differed from the Ju 287 V1 in having the main undercarriage struts with an inward cant, the horizontal stabilizer lowered by 30 centimeters, and light grey-colored trouser pants for the nose wheels. The third and fourth prototypes, the Ju 287 V3 and V4, had six BMW 003s in a triple cluster under each wing, and featured the all-new fuselage and tail design intended for the production bomber, the Ju 287A-1, utilizing a pressurised cockpit used on the Junkers Ju 288. The Ju 287 V5 and V6 were similar but had tail armament, full operational equipment, and ejection seats. The Ju 287B-1 would have had six Junkers Jumo 004s arranged in the same configuration as the BMW 003s that were to power the Ju 287A-1.

Flight tests began on 8 August 1944 (pilot: Siegfried Holzbaur), with the aircraft displaying extremely good handling characteristics, as well as revealing some of the problems of the forward-swept wing under some flight conditions. The most notable of these drawbacks was excessive in-flight flexing of the main spar and wing assembly in the manner of wing warping. Tests suggested that the warping problem would be eliminated by concentrating greater engine mass under the wings. This technical improvement would be incorporated in the subsequent prototypes with under wing engines moved forward under leading edge as a mass balance. The components for the Junkers Ju 287 V2 had been completed by that time, and were shipped to Brandis for final assembly. Seventeen test flights of the Ju 287 V1 were undertaken in total, which passed without notable incident. Minor problems, however, did arise with the turbojet engines and the equally-experimental HWK 109-501 higher-thrust (14.71 kN apiece) bipropellant &quot;Starthilfe&quot; RATO booster units, which proved to be unreliable over sustained periods. This initial test phase was designed purely to assess the low-speed handling qualities of the forward-swept wing, but despite this the V1 was dived at full jet power on at least one occasion, attaining a speed in the medium dive-angle employed of 660 km/h. To gain data on airflow patterns, small woolen tufts were glued to the airframe and the &quot;behavior&quot; of these tufts during flight was captured by a cine camera mounted on a sturdy tripod directly ahead of the plane&#x27;s tailfin. After the seventeenth and last flight in September 1944, the V1 was transferred to the Luftwaffe&#x27;s primary &quot;Erprobungsstelle&quot; evaluation and test centre at Rechlin, for flow tests. By this time, the Ju 287 program along with the Heinkel He 343 project were shelved to save resources for the Volksjäger emergency fighter program. However, in March 1945, for unknown reasons, the Ju 287 program was restarted, with the RLM issuing a requirement for mass production of the jet bomber (100 airframes a month) as soon as possible.

==Postwar development==
The Junkers factory in Dessau was overrun by the Red Army in late April 1945. Before long, the Junkers Ju 287 V2 had been almost completed, waiting for its engines to be fitted, and construction of the V3 had reached 80-90 percent completion, while the V4 was reportedly 60 percent complete. Both V1 and V2 were destroyed by the personnel at the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; test base in Brandis to avoid capture by Allied forces. Wocke and his staff were captured by the Red Army and taken to the Soviet Union, and remnants of V2, especially the wings, were used in construction of the EF 131 which was flown on 23 May 1947, but by that time, jet development had already overtaken the Ju 287. A final much-enlarged derivative, the EF 140, was tested in prototype form in 1949 but soon abandoned.

<doc id="456632" wikidata="Q753896" url="?curid=456632" title="Fool's mate">
<text>The Fool&#x27;s mate is the fastest checkmate in chess delivered after the fewest possible moves from the game&#x27;s starting position. It arises from the following moves, or similar:

:1. e6
:2. ?? 

The mate can be achieved in two moves only by Black, giving checkmate on the second move with the queen. Fool&#x27;s mate received its name because it can occur only if White commits an extraordinary blunder. Black can be mated in an analogous way, although this requires an additional move, with White&#x27;s queen delivering checkmate on the third move. Even among rank beginners, this checkmate rarely occurs in practice.

The mate is an illustration of the weakness shared by both players along the f- and g- during the opening phase of the game. A player may also suffer an early checkmate if the f- and g-pawns are advanced prematurely and the kingside is not properly defended, as shown in historical games recorded in chess literature.

==History==
Fool&#x27;s mate was named and described in &quot;The Royal Game of Chess-Play&quot;, a 1656 text by Francis Beale that adapted the work of the early chess writer Gioachino Greco.

Prior to the mid-19th century, there was not a prevailing convention as to whether White or Black moved first; according to Beale, the matter was to be decided in some prior contest or decision of the players&#x27; choice. In Beale&#x27;s example, Black was the player to move first, with each player making two moves to various squares or &quot;houses&quot;, after which White achieved checkmate.

Beale&#x27;s example can be paraphrased in modern terms where White always moves first, algebraic notation is used, and Black delivers the fastest possible mate after each player makes two moves: 1.f3 e6 2.g4 Qh4

==Move sequence possibilities==

There are eight distinct ways in which fool&#x27;s mate can be reached. White may alternate the order of f- and g-pawn moves, Black may move their e-pawn to e6 or e5, and White may move their f-pawn to f3 or f4.

==Variations==
Mating patterns similar to fool&#x27;s mate can occur early in the game. Such patterns in historical games illustrate the weakness along the e1–h4 and e8–h5 diagonals early in the game. White can mate Black using a pattern that resembles fool&#x27;s mate, though it takes at least an extra turn.

===White to mate in three moves===
White can achieve a checkmate similar to fool&#x27;s mate. When the roles are reversed, however, White requires an extra third turn or half-move, known in computer chess as a ply. In both cases, the principle is the same: a player advances their f- and g-pawns such that the opponent&#x27;s queen can mate along the unblocked diagonal. A board position illustrating White&#x27;s version of fool&#x27;s mate—with White to mate—was given as a problem in &quot;Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess&quot;, and also as an early example in a compendium of problems by László Polgár. The solution in Fischer&#x27;s book bore the comment &quot;Black foolishly weakened his King&#x27;s defenses. This game took three moves!!&quot; One possible sequence leading to the position is 1. e4 g5 2. d4 f6 3. Qh5. 

A possibly apocryphal variant of the fool&#x27;s mate has been reported by several sources. The 1959 game 1. e4 g5 2. Nc3 f5?? 3. Qh5# has been attributed to Masefield and Trinka, although the first player&#x27;s name has also been reported as Mayfield or Mansfield and the second player&#x27;s name as Trinks or Trent. Further, a similar mate can occur in From&#x27;s Gambit: 1. f4 e5 2. g3 exf4 .

There are other possible three-move mates for White, such as 1. e4 e5 2. Qh5 Ke7?? 3. Qxe5#. The total number is 347.

===Black to mate in three moves===

If the typical fool&#x27;s mate setup is played, except White plays h3 instead of g4, a similar forced mate can result: 2... Qh4+ 3. g3 Qxg3#. Like fool&#x27;s mate, there are eight distinct ways for this to happen.

===Teed vs. Delmar===

A well-known in the Dutch Defence occurred in the game Frank Melville Teed–Eugene Delmar, 1896:

:1. d4 f5 2. Bg5 h6 3. Bh4 g5 4. Bg3 f4
It seems that Black has won the bishop, but now comes ...

:5. e3
Threatening Qh5#.

:5... h5 6. Bd3
Probably better is 6.Be2, but the move played sets a trap.

:6... Rh6
Defending against Bg6#, but ...

:7. Qxh5+
White sacrifices his queen to draw the black rook away from its control of g6.

:7... Rxh5 8. Bg6#
===Greco vs. NN===
A similar trap occurred in a game published by Gioachino Greco in 1625:

:1. e4 b6
:2. d4 Bb7
:3. Bd3 f5?
:4. exf5 Bxg2?
:5. Qh5+ g6
:6. fxg6 Nf6??
Opening up a flight square for the king at f8 with 6...Bg7 would have prolonged the game. White still wins with 7.Qf5! Nf6 8.Bh6 Bxh6 9.gxh7 Bxh1 (9...e6 opens another flight square at e7; then White checks with 10.Qg6+ Ke7) 10.Qg6+ Kf8 11.Qxh6+ Kf7 12.Nh3, but much slower than in the game.
:7. gxh7+! Nxh5 
:8. Bg6

<text>Uricani (; ) is a town in the Jiu Valley region of Hunedoara County, in southern Transylvania, Romania. it had a population of 6,669.

==History==
Uricani is first mentioned in a certified document dated 1888, when the locality was referred to as &quot;Hobicza-Urikány&quot; (in Romanian both Hobiceni-Uricani and Uricani-Hobiceni versions were used). The name of Uricani is derived from the union of two villages, Hobița (&quot;Hobica&quot;, listed in documents from 1473 first as &quot;Ohabycza&quot;) and Uric (&quot;Urik&quot;, from 1473 first as &quot;Wryk&quot;) from Hațeg Land. After 1920 the locality&#x27;s name was changed to Uricani. Over time, the village of Câmpu lui Neag functioned as either a separate commune or as a village belonging to Uricani. In 1965, Uricani was declared a city. It administers two villages, Câmpu lui Neag (&quot;Kimpulunyág&quot;) and Valea de Brazi.

Like the other Jiu Valley cities, Uricani&#x27;s principal economic activities revolve around the region&#x27;s coal mines, although the city, like the region, is in a period of transition as the mines have been gradually closed and many of the workers made redundant.

==Location==
The city location lies on the western side of Jiu Valley and at the foot of the Retezat Mountains, with the geographical coordinates of 23° 10′ meridian, east longitude and 45° 25′ parallel, north latitude. The city is located in Hunedoara County and adjacent to Mehedinți and Gorj counties. It lies at an altitude of on the west side of the Petroșani Depression and along the West Jiu River. Its area also contains the smaller waterways of Lazarul, Valea de Pești, Buta, and Bilugu, as well as the fresh water reservoir which contains the drinking water used throughout Jiu Valley.

Uricani is accessed via the national road , the long west branch of the that connects the cities of Petroșani, Vulcan, Lupeni, and Uricani.

The city covers , the largest geographical area of all the Jiu Valley cities. The city limits are bordered to the east by Cow’s Valley, to the west by Retezat National Park, to the north by peaks of the Retezat Mountains, including Custura, Lazarul , and Tulisa , and to the south by peaks of the Vâlcan Mountains, including Coarnele and Șiglăul Mare . The surrounding mountains are part of the Southern Carpathians, in an area sometimes referred to as the Transylvanian Alps.

<text>The Pennsylvanian is a daily daytime Amtrak train running between New York City and Pittsburgh via Philadelphia. The trains travel across the Appalachian Mountains, through Pennsylvania&#x27;s capital Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, suburban and central Philadelphia, and New Jersey en route to New York. The entire train ride takes about 9 hours total: 1.5 hours between New York and Philadelphia, 2 hours between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, and 5.5 hours between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh.

The &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; uses the same Amtrak-owned Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line as the &quot;Keystone Service&quot; trains, but continues further west via the Pittsburgh Line through Altoona and the Allegheny Mountains, eventually terminating its run in Pittsburgh. The Main Line and Pittsburgh Line collectively make up the Keystone Corridor, a federally-designated corridor for high-speed rail service.

==History==
===20th century===
Prior to Amtrak&#x27;s founding, the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; route was covered by the &quot;Duquesne&quot;, named after Fort Duquesne in Pittsburgh, and by the &quot;Juniata&quot;. Both trains operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad and from 1968 to 1971 by the PRR&#x27;s successor, the Penn Central. The &quot;Duquesne&quot; had a long history, finally becoming a daily New York–Pittsburgh train on October 25, 1959, numbered 16 eastbound and 25 westbound. When the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s successor, Penn Central, was formed in 1968, it continued to operate the &quot;Duquesne&quot; and the &quot;Juniata.&quot;

With the start of Amtrak operations on May 1, 1971, the &quot;Duquesne&quot; was renamed the &quot;Keystone&quot; and renumbered 42 westbound and 43 eastbound with the first Amtrak timetable on November 14, 1971. The &quot;Keystone&quot; was discontinued on April 30, 1972.

The immediate impetus for the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; was the discontinuance of the &quot;National Limited&quot;, a New York–Kansas City train which had provided service over the corridor. That train, in turn, was the successor of the famed &quot;Spirit of St Louis.&quot; The &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; began on April 27, 1980, as a state-supported daylight train between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, with connecting service to New York City via the &quot;Philadelphian&quot;, a Clocker train westbound and the &quot;Montrealer&quot; eastbound.

At the time the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; was inaugurated, the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; was departing Pittsburgh at an inconvenient early morning hour. The new train ran with Amfleet equipment, including a cafe car. Pennsylvania agreed to pay 20% of the train&#x27;s costs for the first year, or $580,000, with the state and Amtrak eventually splitting the costs 50/50 by the third year.

Between 1981 and 1983, &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; equipment was turned every night to operate a second state-supported train, the &quot;Fort Pitt&quot;, which ran from Pittsburgh to Altoona. Amtrak withdrew this train in early 1983 after the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) declined to continue subsidizing the increased operation. At the time the &quot;Fort Pitt&quot; carried 30 passengers per day. On October 30, 1983, the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; was extended to New York City, eliminating the transfer at Philadelphia.

After significant ridership gains in 1984, PennDOT proposed that a second train be added to the route. PennDOT and Amtrak would have split the costs evenly. Amtrak officials were favorable, but budget problems stalled the plan.

In the late 1980s, passenger rail groups urged Amtrak to extend the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; to Cleveland, Ohio. Proposals included new stations in Sewickley and Beaver Falls. Pressure increased in 1989 when Amtrak announced the re-routing of the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; and &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; over that same route as part of a restructuring of routes in Indiana. As part of this change, the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; began serving the Cleveland–Pittsburgh route, albeit in the middle of the night. Amtrak and PennDOT considered two routes for an extended &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot;: one via Alliance, Ohio, following the route of the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot;, and one via Youngstown, Ohio, partially following the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot;, with a new stop in New Castle, Pennsylvania.

On November 7, 1998, Amtrak extended the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; through to Chicago along the route of the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; via Toledo, finally bringing a daylight connection to Cleveland. The &quot;Three Rivers&quot; continued to run over a different schedule via Akron, Ohio and Fostoria. As part of the change Amtrak truncated the eastern end to Philadelphia, enabling the train to complete the run within a single day. 

The change was driven by Amtrak&#x27;s growing mail and express business; Pittsburgh–Philadelphia ridership suffered. 

===21st century===
Amtrak returned the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; to the New York–Pittsburgh route on January 27, 2003, citing low ridership and Amtrak&#x27;s withdrawal from the express freight business. 

On November 1, 2004, Amtrak merged the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; and &quot;Three Rivers&quot;, keeping the latter name with a western terminus in Chicago. Amtrak had sought $2.5 million in assistance from Pennsylvania to keep both trains running. On March 8, 2005, Amtrak truncated service to Pittsburgh-New York City, and restored the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; name to the route.

The train has been primarily financed by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation since October 1, 2013, when the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 took effect. This federal law eliminated federal subsidies for Amtrak routes less than in length. 

In late 2019, the train began operating with a baggage car for checked baggage and bicycle handling at New York, Newark, Philadelphia, Lancaster, Harrisburg, Altoona, Johnstown and Pittsburgh. 

In March 2020, service on the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; was suspended as part of a round of service reduction in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Service resumed on June 1, 2020.

== Proposed expansion ==

===Increased frequency===

The Pennsylvania State Rail Plan 2020 called for a second round-trip Amtrak train between Pittsburgh and New York City, with one trip beginning and terminating in Cleveland. The second trip was then projected to begin during the fiscal year running from October 2023 to September 2024. The feasibility, schedule, and cost of adding a second train were underway as of November 2020.

In June 2022, the state and Norfolk Southern announced an agreement for a $200 million capacity improvement, with a second &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; round trip to be added by 2025. By August 2023, the opening date had slipped to 2026, with construction on the necessary infrastructure planned to start in 2024. In September 2023, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and Norfolk Southern reached an agreement on making the necessary $200 million worth of improvements to the line for a second daily service.

In December 2023, the project was awarded $143.6 million from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) with PennDOT providing 20% in matching funds. The &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; route was also selected into the FRA&#x27;s Corridor Identification and Development Program, granting $500,000 to study further service increases.

===Westward extension===

There is currently no through service west of Pittsburgh, though the &quot;Floridian&quot; continues to provide service to Chicago. As part of its federally mandated analysis of the worst-performing long-distance routes, Amtrak determined that reinstating a through-car connection with the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; would result in the highest gain in monetary and customer service measurements of possible options. To implement this, Amtrak plans to operate a Viewliner sleeper car, an Amfleet cafe car and two Amfleet coaches between Chicago and New York approximating the historic &quot;Broadway Limited&quot;, via the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; and &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot;. This would begin when funding and equipment is available. On January 28, 2011, it was announced that Pennsylvania had received a $750,000 grant from the federal government to study expanding service westwards from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh along the route of the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot;, including higher speeds and additional frequencies.

== Operation ==
=== Equipment ===

A typical &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; consists of a locomotive, a Viewliner baggage car, an Amfleet Business Class coach, Amfleet Café car, and four or five Amfleet coaches.

Between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, trains are pulled by a GE Genesis diesel locomotive at speeds up to . Between Philadelphia and New York, the service operates over the Northeast Corridor which has overhead electric wires and trains are pulled by Siemens ACS-64 electric locomotives at speeds up to 

In the coming years all equipment will be replaced with Amtrak Airo trainsets, the railroad&#x27;s branding of its combination of Siemens Venture passenger cars and a Siemens Charger diesel-electric locomotive. The trainsets for the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; will have six passenger cars, which will include a food service area and a mix of 2x2 Coach Class and 2x1 Business Class seating. The car closest to the locomotive will be a specialized &quot;Auxiliary Power Vehicle&quot; which will include a pantograph to collect power from overhead lines and will feed it to four traction motors in the car, and via a DC link cable, to the four traction motors in the locomotive. The arrangement will offer a near seamless transition between power sources, a process that currently requires a time-consuming locomotive change in Philadelphia.

=== Classes of service ===
All classes of service include complimentary WiFi, an electric outlet (120 V, 60 Hz AC) at each seat, reading lamps, fold-out tray tables. Reservations are required on all trains, tickets may be purchased online, from an agent at some stations, a ticketing machine at most stations, or, at a higher cost, from the conductor on the train.
*Coach Class: 2x2 seating. Passengers self-select seats on a first-come, first-served basis.
*Business Class: 2x2 seating with complimentary soft drinks.

=== Ridership ===
Over fiscal years 2009–2016, ridership grew from 199,484 to 223,114, an increase of 10.6%. Ridership peaked at 231,720 in FY 2015. Ticket revenue grew from $7,819,404 to $11,555,451, an increase of 47.8%. Starting in 2017 Amtrak stopped reporting their revenue data alongside ridership data. as such it was excluded.

Starting in fiscal year 2020, Amtrak revised how it calculates ridership, causing a small but noticeable drop in the 2019 numbers. It was chosen to report the revised metrics below.

==== COVID-19 ====
The impact of COVID-19 was split across FY2020 and FY2021, as reflected in the lower than average passenger numbers across those two years. The pandemic caused an initial drop of ridership in FY2020 of 39% on the route as compared to FY2019. The drop remained throughout FY2021, with a relative drop of 40.3% compared to FY2019, the last fiscal year pre-covid data exists.

=== Route ===

Going westwards, the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; initially follows the portion of the Amtrak-owned Northeast Corridor from New York City to Philadelphia; the remainder of the route follows the historic Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Main Line. It reverses direction in Philadelphia and follows the Amtrak-owned Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line to Harrisburg. The remaining portion over the Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Pittsburgh Line follows the Juniata River and then Little Juniata River to Altoona, after which it climbs Allegheny Mountain and then follows the Little Conemaugh River and then Conemaugh River. After crossing Chestnut Ridge, it winds across the Allegheny Plateau before descending Brush Creek and Turtle Creek into the Pittsburgh area.

It was released on 10 March 2003 and is Cradle of Filth&#x27;s only album on a major label, Sony Records, after which they transferred to Roadrunner. It features the one hundred and one-piece Budapest Film Orchestra including the forty-piece Budapest Film Choir. The album is partly based on John Milton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;.

== Background ==
In addition to the Miltonic arc, the album also features stand-alone tracks such as the Nile tribute &quot;Doberman Pharaoh&quot; and the Aleister Crowley-influenced &quot;Babalon A.D. (So Glad for the Madness)&quot;.

== Recording ==
This is the first Cradle of Filth release since &quot;V Empire&quot; to feature only one full-time guitar player (Paul Allender), as former guitarist Gian Pyres quit the band shortly before the writing and recording process. Keyboardist Martin Powell played session guitars for the album as well as keyboards. This is also the first album to feature Dave Pybus on bass. He would go on to play on all of Cradle&#x27;s subsequent releases until 2012. Narration on the first track of each section is by David McEwen, who played Kemper in the 2001 horror film &quot;Cradle of Fear&quot; (also starring Cradle frontman Dani Filth) and appeared in the video for &quot;Her Ghost in the Fog&quot;, miming Doug Bradley&#x27;s vocals.

A cover of Cliff Richard&#x27;s &quot;Devil Woman&quot; was originally recorded during the &quot;Damnation and a Day&quot; sessions, but only surfaced on the special edition of &quot;Nymphetamine&quot; in 2005, re-recorded, with some of the lyrics altered (&quot;feminine ways&quot; became &quot;nymphetamine ways&quot;).

The album&#x27;s recording process was documented on Cradle&#x27;s 2005 video release &quot;Peace Through Superior Firepower&quot;.

== Videos ==
The album spawned two DVD singles for the songs &quot;Babalon A.D. (So Glad for the Madness)&quot; and &quot;Mannequin&quot;. The former was directed by Wiz (who had previously worked with Marilyn Manson), and was modelled on Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s film &quot;Salò&quot;; an adaptation of the Marquis de Sade&#x27;s &quot;The 120 Days of Sodom&quot;. The latter, reminiscent of the films of Jan Švankmajer, was directed by Thomas Mignone, and featured stop motion animation by George Higham.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Damnation and a Day&quot; received a mixed response from critics. AllMusic wrote, &quot;[&quot;Damnation and a Day&quot;] has some grand-sounding moments, and is recorded cleanly, with the symphonic and operatic elements being perhaps its best. But it is endless, and only a true Filth fan could tell one song from another&quot;, ultimately calling it a &quot;taxing, less-than-monumental work that won&#x27;t win them many new mainstream fans, if that&#x27;s at all what they had in mind.&quot; Influential extreme metal website Chronicles of Chaos wrote, &quot;The songs are lengthy without exception, exploring multiple motifs, but the quality has been stretched out to breaking point. Whereas &quot;Midian&quot; offered us glossy slabs of great atmospheric metal, &quot;Damnation&quot; serves up overblown constructions that only capture your interest in sporadic bursts&quot;, before finishing with, &quot;It is a real shame that Cradle&#x27;s mainstream label debut should sound this misguided; one can painfully hear the effort that has been put into making &quot;Damnation and a Day&quot; a reality. What will sadden most CoF devotees is the reality that the insidious atmosphere that suffused &quot;The Principle of Evil Made Flesh&quot; through to &quot;Dusk... and Her Embrace&quot; has all but disappeared&quot;.

<doc id="456653" wikidata="Q254597" url="?curid=456653" title="Ethan Allen Express">
<text>The Ethan Allen Express is a daily passenger train operated by Amtrak in the United States between New York City and Burlington, Vermont, via Albany, New York. One daily round trip is operated on a north–south route with a 7-hour 35 minute scheduled running time. The train is subsidized by New York and Vermont for the portion north of Albany. It is named for Vermont cofounder and American Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen.

&quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; service began on December 2, 1996, acting as an extended &quot;Empire Service&quot; train. It was the first passenger service to Rutland since 1953 and the first to use the line between Rutland and Whitehall since 1934. The train&#x27;s schedule has been adjusted a number of times, particularly in the early years of its operation, in an attempt to serve both tourists to Vermont and Vermonters traveling to New York City. From February 1998 to April 2002, a second northbound trip was operated – at some times only a shuttle service from Albany.

An infill station in Fair Haven, Vermont, was added in November 1997; it was replaced with a stop in nearby Castleton in January 2010. Service north of Albany was suspended from March 2020 to July 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. An extension to Burlington, Vermont, with new stations in Middlebury and Vergennes began service on July 29, 2022. Further proposed expansions include a second daily train running via North Bennington, Vermont; an extension to Essex Junction, Vermont, to connect with the &quot;Vermonter&quot;; and additional infill stations and higher speeds in Vermont.

== Operation ==
===Route===
The &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; operates approximately north–south between New York Penn Station and Burlington, save for an approximately east–west section between Whitehall, New York, and Rutland, Vermont. All of the route south of Whitehall is also used by the &quot;Adirondack&quot;. The stretch between Schenectady and New York City is also used by &quot;Empire Service&quot;, &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;, and &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; trains; the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; acts as an additional &quot;Empire Service&quot; trip on this portion. The train is scheduled for 7 hours 35 minutes between New York City and Burlington. Northbound trips depart in the early afternoon; southbound trips depart in the late morning.

The train operates over the following trackage:
*Vermont Railway: Burlington, Vermont–Whitehall
*Canadian Pacific Kansas City: Canadian Subdivision (Whitehall–Glenville, New York) and Freight Subdivision (Glenville–Schenectady, New York)
*CSX Transportation/Amtrak Hudson Subdivision: Schenectady–Poughkeepsie, New York
*Metro-North Railroad Hudson Line: Poughkeepsie–Spuyten Duyvil, Bronx, New York City
*Amtrak Empire Connection: Spuyten Duyvil–New York Penn Station

The &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; operates as higher-speed rail on the Hudson Subdivision, with speeds up to . Maximum speeds are on the Hudson Line, on the Empire Connection, on the Freight Subdivision, on the Canadian Subdivision, and on the Vermont Railway.

=== Equipment ===

&quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; trains typically have five Amfleet passenger cars: four coaches plus a club car with 2x1 business class seating and a cafe area. Trains operate with two GE P32AC-DM dual-mode locomotives, one at each end, which operate on third rail electric power in Penn Station and the Empire Connection tunnel and on diesel power for the rest of the route.

In the late 2020s and early 2030s, all equipment will be replaced with Amtrak Airo trainsets, the railroad&#x27;s branding of its combination of Siemens Venture passenger cars and a Siemens Charger diesel-electric locomotive. The trainsets for the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; will have six passenger cars, which will include a cab control car food service area and a mix of 2x2 coach and 2x1 business class seating. The car closest to the locomotive will have batteries to supply electricity to traction motors in the locomotive when operating in Penn Station and the Empire Connection tunnel, eliminating the need for third rail propulsion.

=== Ridership and funding ===
Ridership in Fiscal Year 20 was . The train is subsidized by New York and Vermont for the portion north of Albany, in proportion to mileage on that section in each state. In FY 2019, the Vermont portion of the subsidy (44%) was $1.57 million, while the New York portion was about $2 million.

The Vermont Agency of Transportation subsidizes discounted fares for most intra-Vermont travel on the route. The route is supplemented by two daily bus round trips operated by Vermont Translines between Albany and Burlington which act as Amtrak Thruway connections to Empire Corridor trains at Albany–Rensselaer. These bus routes also provide Amtrak connections for several Vermont towns presently without direct Amtrak service, such as Bennington and Manchester.

== History ==
=== Planning and service start ===

Prior passenger service between Rutland and points south was operated by the Delaware and Hudson Railroad over the Whitehall Branch (Rutland–Whitehall) and Washington Branch (–Eagle Bridge) and by the Rutland Railroad over its mainline (–Rutland–) and Chatham Branch (Rutland–Chatham). Washington Branch and Whitehall Branch passenger service ended on June 24, 1934. The Rutland Railroad continued to operate passenger service to Rutland, including the New York City–Montreal &quot;Green Mountain Flyer&quot; and &quot;Mount Royal&quot;, until 1953. After the Rutland filed to abandoned its entire system in 1963, the state-owned Vermont Railway took over freight service on most of the lines in 1964. The Central Vermont Railway continued to operate the &quot;Montrealer&quot;, providing passenger service to the eastern and northern parts of the state, until 1966. Amtrak took over intercity passenger service in the United States in 1971 and resumed the overnight &quot;Montrealer&quot; in 1972.

Politicians including Curtis McCormack unsuccessfully attempted to obtain funding for Amtrak service to Rutland in the 1980s. Then-governor Howard Dean created the Vermont Rail Council headed by McCormack in 1991, with instruction to study Rutland service, but most attention was focused on the &quot;Montrealer&quot;. In late 1994, Amtrak announced that the &quot;Montrealer&quot; would be discontinued due to budget cuts. While state officials worked to retain that service, adding a route to Rutland (and possibly Burlington) was also supported by Dean. In April 1995, the &quot;Montrealer&quot; was cut back to St. Albans as the state-subsidized &quot;Vermonter&quot; on a daytime schedule. Later than month, $3.5 million was included in a federal funding bill. Along with $1 million from the Vermont Railway and $743,000 from the state, this funded $5.24 million in trackwork, which upgraded of the Whitehall Branch from to maximum speed.

The state originally planned to call the new service the &quot;Green Mountain Flyer&quot; after the former Rutland Railroad train. However, the Green Mountain Railroad objected, as they already used that name for a tourist train. On August 15, 1996, the state announced it would be called the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; after Vermont cofounder and American Revolutionary War patriot Ethan Allen. The state agreed to a $200,000 annual subsidy, which reflected the cost of extending one &quot;Empire Service&quot; round trip from Albany to Rutland. Service began with the northbound trip on December 2, 1996, with the first southbound trip the following day. The &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; began with stops in , , , , , , , , , and New York City. Because the &quot;Adirondack&quot; already served the section between New York City and Whitehall, the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; only added and one station (Rutland) to the Amtrak system. A trailer was used as a temporary station at Rutland; the station building, funded by $700,000 from the federal government, did not open until 1999.

=== Early service changes ===

The &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; was intended to support tourism in the Rutland areas, particularly winter travel to Killington Ski Resort and Pico Mountain. The train&#x27;s schedule has been adjusted a number of times, particularly in the early years of its operation, in an attempt to serve both tourists to Vermont and Vermonters traveling to New York City. The initial schedule had a running time slightly over five hours, with afternoon departures from both terminals on weekdays. Saturday southbound trains departed Rutland at 7:05am to allow for weekend trips to New York City, while Sunday trains in both directions departed in the later afternoon to accommodate weekend trips.

In October 1997, the southbound Saturday departure moved to the same afternoon time as weekdays, while the Friday and Sunday northbound departures moved to the late-afternoon time. An infill station at Fair Haven was added on November 12, 1997. On February 15, 1998, Amtrak added a morning northbound train from Albany to Rutland, providing a connection from the northbound &quot;Maple Leaf&quot;; this gave a second northbound trip to Rutland, though still only one southbound trip. The change reduced the state subsidy by eliminating the need for overnight crew accommodations: the morning northbound trip turned around to become the afternoon southbound trip, while the afternoon northbound trip deadheaded from Rutland to Albany in the late evening for servicing.

In October 1998, the Sunday southbound departure was shifted two hours later to allow more time for skiers, while the Saturday southbound departure was moved up to match weekdays. From August 16 to October 31, 1999, the Vermont Railway operated the &quot;Ethan Allen Connection&quot; between Rutland and Burlington with an intermediate stop at Middlebury. It was discontinued due to low ridership; most passengers only rode between Rutland and Burlington, with just 20–25% connecting to the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot;. On October 31, northbound service was reconfigured. A daily train departed New York at 6:15 am – an hour earlier than the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot;. The afternoon northbound train continued to run Monday–Thursday; the Saturday northbound shifted to that time, while the Sunday afternoon northbound was canceled. The Friday northbound trip became an express operating nonstop between New York and Schenectady, with a hour schedule – the fastest time ever scheduled for the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot;.

A baggage car was added to the train for bikes and ski equipment in late 1998, but it could not be used for luggage until February 2000 when an attendant was hired for Rutland station. The baggage car was removed in 2002 due to low usage, elimination of station agents due to state budget cuts, and the older baggage cars not being certified for as high speeds as the rest of the train. The schedule was simplified on April 29, 2001: daily afternoon trips in both direction, plus a morning Albany–Rutland northbound trip with no New York connection. The morning trip became a New York–Rutland trip on July 9, while the Sunday trip was again moved to later in the afternoon. The morning trip was cut back to an Albany–Rutland shuttle in January 2002 and discontinued entirely that April. In April 2003, the Friday northbound trip was moved later in the evening, while weekday southbound trips were moved to a 7:15 am departure. Monday and Saturday southbound departures were moved to 10:45 am in November 2004. The Monday southbound trip was moved back to match the other weekdays in October 2007.

=== Further changes ===

In October 2008, the Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) proposed eliminating the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; and replacing it with a bus, citing budgetary restrictions. The proposal was rejected by a legislative committee. VTrans again proposed ending service in January 2009. Opposition from the Vermont Rail Action Network and local political leaders resulted in the service being kept. On January 2, 2010, the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; began stopping at Castleton. Service to Fair Haven ended on January 9.

Beginning in the mid-2000s, poor track conditions between Whitehall and Rutland also affected the train&#x27;s performance. In February 2011, VTrans began an investigation into the Vermont Rail System&#x27;s handling of the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; after Amtrak ranked VRS as the worst host railroad in the country. On-time performance of the train was below 70% by that time, with track conditions responsible for 91% of delays. Vermont Rail Systems began track work in April 2011, which reduced travel times by 10 minutes by that October. The project, funded by both the railroad and the state of New York at a cost of $3.25 million, involved rebuilding about of track and eight grade crossings. By February 2012, additional trackwork had resulted in a 15-minute southbound and 25-minute northbound reduction in travel time between Rutland and Whitehall.

The Friday northbound trip operated on the same mid-afternoon schedule from July 10 to September 5, 2017, during track work at New York Penn Station. From May 26 to September 3, 2018, the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; and other Empire Corridor trains were diverted to Grand Central Terminal during further Penn Station track work. On March 26, 2020, the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; was suspended north of Albany–Rensselaer at the request of Vermont Governor Phil Scott due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Service to Rutland resumed on July 19, 2021, with $1 promotional fares on that date for travel within Vermont.

=== Extension to Burlington ===

Even before service began, state planners intended to later extend the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; from Rutland to Burlington. In 2005, Senator Jim Jeffords obtained a $30 million earmark for upgrades to the Rutland–Burlington rail corridor in preparation for a possible &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; extension. Jeffords had long championed passenger rail in western Vermont, which does not have an interstate highway. His original goal was New York–Burlington service via Bennington. The Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) applied three times for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds to rebuild the tracks between Rutland and Burlington; none of the applications were successful.

The state received $9 million in Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery funds for the project in 2013, and an additional $10 million in 2015. This completed funding for the $26 million project, which included rebuilding of track to allow speeds of for freight and for passenger trains between Rutland and Burlington. Other work included the construction of stations at and , a new platform at Burlington Union Station, adding crossovers and passing sidings, improving grade crossings, and rebuilding a wye at Rutland. The former New Haven Junction station building was relocated, as it was too close to the tracks. A separately-funded project constructed a rail tunnel in downtown Middlebury to replace aging bridges and increase clearances for freight use.

VTrans originally planned for trains to lay over overnight at Union Station, but nearby residents objected to having the locomotive idle there. In March 2020, VTrans indicated that the Vermont Railway yard to the south would instead be modified to accommodate the train. The two new stations and the new Burlington platform were built in 2020–2022. In October 2021, Amtrak and Vermont Rail System began running qualification trips between Rutland and Burlington to familiarize train crews with the new route. 

Revenue service to Burlington began on July 29, 2022, with trains departing early afternoon northbound and late morning southbound all days. It was the first direct passenger rail service to Burlington in 69 years. The first day of service was marred by a temporary suspension of all Amtrak service west of Albany caused by a deteriorating trackside structure, the Central Warehouse, in North Albany. Passengers were bussed between Saratoga Springs and Albany–Rensselaer. The extension caused an immediate increase in ridership, with August 2022 ridership about 50% higher than August 2019. Ridership in Fiscal Year 2023 – the first full fiscal year of Burlington service – was 86,638, exceeding the pre-pandemic FY 2019 figure of 50,515. 

=== Future ===

VTrans listed several possible improvements to the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; in the 2021 Vermont Rail Plan. These included potential infill flag stops in Brandon and Shelburne. Positive train control and track upgrades would allow the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; to reach speeds of , up from , on sections between Whitehall and Burlington. This would save about 15 minutes per trip, with an estimated increase of 1,400 to 2,600 annual riders by 2040. VTrans also analyzed a possible extension of the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; from Burlington to Essex Junction via the New England Central Railroad Winooski Branch, where transfer could be made with the &quot;Vermonter&quot;. The branch would first have to be upgraded to increase its current passenger train speed limit of . This would attract between 4,900 and 7,800 additional riders per year by 2040 (assuming the &quot;Vermonter&quot; is extended to Montreal).

In 2014, VTrans and the New York State Department of Transportation studied the potential serving southwestern Vermont either with a second daily train or rerouting the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot;. The proposed alternative was to extend an &quot;Empire Service&quot; train to Rutland, operating on a more southern route than the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; between Glenville, New York and Rutland. It would use existing Canadian Pacific Railway (now Canadian Pacific Kansas City), Pan Am Railways (now CSX Transportation), and Vermont Railway freight lines, with new intermediate stops at Mechanicville, New York, North Bennington, Vermont, and Manchester, Vermont. The 2021 Vermont Rail Plan indicated that should it be implemented, this second service would also extend to Burlington.

In December 2023, the Federal Railroad Administration accepted an application by VTrans to enter the New York–Albany–Mechanicville–Bennington–Rutland–Burlington route into its Corridor Identification and Development Program. The program grants $500,000 toward service planning and prioritizes the route for future federal funding. The application referred to the route as the Green Mountain Corridor.

<text>Phenacetin (; acetophenetidin, &quot;N&quot;-(4-ethoxyphenyl)acetamide) is a pain-relieving and fever-reducing drug, which was widely used following its introduction in 1887. It was withdrawn from medicinal use as dangerous from the 1970s (e.g., withdrawn in Canada in 1973, and by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1983).

==History==
Phenacetin was introduced in 1887 in Elberfeld, Germany by German company Bayer, and was used principally as an analgesic; it was one of the first synthetic fever reducers to go on the market. It is also known historically to be one of the first non-opioid analgesics without anti-inflammatory properties. Although paracetamol (acetaminophen) was produced earlier, a historical accident saw it ignored after Joseph von Mering&#x27;s 1893 assessment.

Prior to World War One, Britain imported phenacetin from Germany. During the war, a team including Jocelyn Field Thorpe and Martha Annie Whiteley developed a synthesis in Britain.

==Known mechanism of action==
Phenacetin&#x27;s analgesic effects are due to its actions on the sensory tracts of the spinal cord. In addition, phenacetin has a depressant action on the heart, where it acts as a negative inotrope. It is an antipyretic, acting on the brain to decrease the temperature set point. It is also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (subacute type) and intercostal neuralgia.

In vivo, one of two reactions occur. Usually phenacetin&#x27;s ether is cleaved to leave paracetamol (acetaminophen), which is the clinically relevant analgesic. A minority
of the time the acetyl group is removed from the amine, producing carcinogenic p-phenetidine. This reaction is quite rare, however, as evidenced by the fact that the drug was on the market for almost 100 years before a statistical link was established, when Canada, followed by the United States, withdrew it from the market.

==Preparation==
The first synthesis was reported in 1878 by Harmon Northrop Morse. Morse&#x27;s cited article describes the synthesis of paracetamol from 4-aminophenol and acetic acid.

Phenacetin may be synthesized as an example of the Williamson ether synthesis: ethyl iodide, paracetamol, and anhydrous potassium carbonate are heated in 2-butanone to give the crude product, which is recrystallized from water.

==Uses==
=== Medical ===
Phenacetin was widely used until the third quarter of the twentieth century, often in the form of an A.P.C., or &quot;aspirin-phenacetin-caffeine&quot; compound analgesic, as a remedy for fever and pain. An early formulation (1919) was Vincent&#x27;s APC in Australia.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration ordered the withdrawal of drugs containing phenacetin in November 1983, due to its carcinogenic and kidney-damaging properties. It was also banned in India. As a result, some branded, and previously phenacetin-based, preparations continued to be sold, but with the phenacetin replaced by safer alternatives. A popular brand of phenacetin was Roche&#x27;s Saridon, which was reformulated in 1983 to contain propyphenazone, paracetamol and caffeine. Coricidin was also reformulated without phenacetin. Paracetamol is a metabolite of phenacetin with similar analgesic and antipyretic effects, but the new formulation has not been found to have phenacetin&#x27;s carcinogenicity.

=== Other ===
Phenacetin has been used as a cutting agent to adulterate cocaine in the UK and Canada, due to the similar physical properties. There, it has been given the nickname &quot;magic&quot;.

Due to its low cost, phenacetin is used for research into the physical and refractive properties of crystals. It is an ideal compound for this type of research.

In Canada, phenacetin is used as a laboratory reagent, and in a few hair dye preparations (as a stabilizer for hydrogen peroxide). While it is considered a prescription drug, no marketed drugs contain phenacetin.

==Safety==
Phenacetin, and products containing phenacetin, have been shown in an animal model to have the side effect and after-effect of carcinogenesis. In humans, many case reports have implicated products containing phenacetin in urothelial neoplasms, especially urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis. Phenacetin is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as carcinogenic to humans. In one prospective series, phenacetin was associated with an increased risk of death due to urologic or renal diseases, death due to cancers, and death due to cardiovascular diseases.
In addition, people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may experience acute hemolysis, or dissolution of blood cells, while taking this drug. Acute hemolysis is possible in the case of patients who develop an IgM response to phenacetin leading to immune complexes that bind to erythrocytes in blood. The erythrocytes are then lysed when the complexes activate the complement system.

Chronic use of phenacetin is known to lead to analgesic nephropathy characterized by renal papillary necrosis. This is a condition which results in destruction of some or all of the renal papillae in the kidneys. It is believed that the metabolite &quot;p&quot;-phenetidine is at least partly responsible for these effects.

One notable death that can possibly be attributed to the use of this drug was that of the aviation pioneer Howard Hughes. He had been using phenacetin extensively for the treatment of chronic pain; it was stated during his autopsy that phenacetin use may have been the cause of his kidney failure.

== In popular culture ==
A 1974 episode of the Yorkshire Television series &quot;Justice&quot;, &quot;Duty of Care&quot;, features a court case that resulted from a woman dying of phenacetin poisoning, as a result of taking A.P.C. for five years. This explained that phenacetin caused renal papillary necrosis.

In the book &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; chapter 4, &quot;APCs for headaches&quot; is included in a list of valuable things to take on motorcycle trips.

<text>The Black Eye Galaxy (also called Sleeping Beauty Galaxy or Evil Eye Galaxy and designated Messier 64, M64, or NGC 4826) is a relatively isolated spiral galaxy 17 million light-years away in the mildly northern constellation of Coma Berenices. It was discovered by Edward Pigott in March 1779, and independently by Johann Elert Bode in April of the same year, as well as by Charles Messier the next year. A dark band of absorbing dust partially in front of its bright nucleus gave rise to its nicknames of the &quot;Black Eye&quot;, &quot;Evil Eye&quot;, or &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; galaxy. M64 is well known among amateur astronomers due to its form in small telescopes and visibility across inhabited latitudes.

This galaxy is inclined 60° to the line-of-sight and has a position angle of 112°. At the distance of this galaxy, it has a linear scale of per arcsecond. The morphological classification in the De Vaucouleurs system is (R)SA(rs)ab, where the &#x27;(R)&#x27; indicates an outer ring-like structure, &#x27;SA&#x27; denotes a non-barred spiral, &#x27;(rs)&#x27; means a transitional inner ring/spiral structure, and &#x27;ab&#x27; says the spiral arms are fairly tightly wound. Ann et al. (2015) gave it a class of SABa, suggesting a weakly barred spiral galaxy with tightly wound arms.

M64 is a type 2 Seyfert galaxy with an HII/LINER nucleus. The central region is a weak source of radio emission. A soft X-ray source has been detected at the nucleus, which is most likely coming from the circumnuclear region rather than directly from an active galactic nucleus. There is an inner disk of molecular gas that is truncated at a radius of . At present, the non-rotational motions of this disk do not significantly feed the core, but the disk does produce a vigorous rate of star formation, with also approximately 100 billion stars inside the galaxy. There is also evidence of a recent large inflow of mass. The central supermassive black hole is calculated to have a mass of about .

The interstellar medium of Messier 64 consists of two counter-rotating disks that are approximately equal in mass. The inner disk contains the prominent dust lanes of the galaxy. The stellar population of the galaxy exhibits no measurable counter-rotation. Possible formation scenarios include a merger with a gas-rich satellite galaxy in a retrograde orbit, or the continued accretion of gas clouds from the intergalactic medium. It has a diameter of .

<text>In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Phoebe ( ; ) is one of the first generation of Titans, who were one set of sons and daughters of Uranus and Gaia, the sky and the earth. With her brother and consort Coeus she had two daughters, Leto and Asteria. She is thus the grandmother of the Olympian gods Apollo and Artemis, as well as the witchcraft goddess Hecate.

According to the myth, she was the original owner of the site of the Oracle of Delphi before gifting it to her grandson Apollo. Her name, meaning &quot;bright&quot;, was also given to a number of lunar goddesses like Artemis and later the Roman goddesses Luna and Diana, but Phoebe herself was not actively seen as a moon goddess in her own right in ancient religion or mythology.

== Etymology ==
The Greek name &quot;Phoíbē&quot; is the feminine form of &quot;Phoîbos&quot; meaning &quot;pure, bright, radiant&quot;, an epithet given to Apollo as a sun-god. &quot;Phoebe&quot; was also an epithet of Artemis as a moon-goddess. Due to Apollo&#x27;s role in myth, the name additionally came to mean &quot;prophet&quot;, giving words like &quot;phoibázō&quot; &quot;to prophesize&quot;. As an adjective, it was also used to refer to &quot;clear, pure&quot; water.

== Family ==
Phoebe is a Titaness, one of the twelve (or thirteen) divine children born to Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth). Phoebe&#x27;s consort was her brother Coeus, with whom she had two daughters, first Leto, who bore Apollo and Artemis, and then Asteria, a star goddess who bore an only daughter, Hecate. Hesiod in the &quot;Theogony&quot; describes Phoebe as &quot;&quot; (&quot;khrysostéphanos&quot;, meaning &quot;golden-crowned&quot;).

== Mythology ==
Through Leto, Phoebe was the grandmother of Apollo and Artemis. The names &quot;Phoebe&quot; and &quot;Phoebus&quot; (masculine) came to be applied as synonyms for Artemis/Diana and Apollo respectively, as well as for Luna and Sol, the lunar goddess and the solar god, by the Roman poets; the late-antiquity grammarian Servius writes that &quot;Phoebe is Luna, like Phoebus is Sol.&quot; Phoebe was, like Artemis, identified by Roman poets with the Roman moon goddess Diana. Phoebe means &quot;bright&quot; but is functionally only a name; in mythology, the role of moon goddess is fulfilled by other deities as her grandchildren inherit her name. Because of this Apollo is sometimes known as &quot;Phoebeus Apollo&quot;.

According to a speech that Aeschylus puts into the mouth of the Delphic priestess herself in &quot;The Eumenides&quot;, Phoebe received control of the Oracle at Delphi from her sister Themis, who herself had received it from their mother Gaia, and then passed it on Apollo, her grandson, as a gift for his birthday: D. S. Robertson noted &quot;Phoebe in this succession seems to be his private invention,&quot; reasoning that in the three great allotments of oracular powers at Delphi, corresponding to the three generations of the gods, &quot;Ouranos, as was fitting, gave the oracle to his wife Gaia and Kronos appropriately allotted it to his sister Themis.&quot; Robertson also speculates that in Zeus&#x27; turn to make the gift, Aeschylus could not report that the oracle was given directly to Apollo, who had not yet been born, and thus Phoebe was interposed. These supposed male delegations of the powers at Delphi as expressed by Aeschylus are not borne out by the usual modern reconstruction of the sacred site&#x27;s pre-Olympian history.

== Iconography ==
Due to her minimal presence in both mythology and religion Phoebe was traditionally not depicted in ancient Greek or Roman art, so she has no distinct iconography. Nevertheless, Phoebe appears on the southeast corner of the Pergamon Altar which depicts the Gigantomachy, fighting against a Giant with animal features, similar to the one her daughter Leto is fighting. Phoebe, wearing a diadem and a very creased dress, is seen wielding a flaming torch and fighting next to her daughter other Asteria.

== Legacy ==
Phoebe, one of the moons of Saturn is named after this goddess, as the sister of Cronus, Saturn&#x27;s Greek equivalent. Phoebe (also spelled Phebe) is also a popular feminine given name in the English-speaking world.

<doc id="456666" wikidata="Q2052932" url="?curid=456666" title="2004 Australian federal election">
<text>The 2004 Australian federal election was held in Australia on 9 October 2004. All 150 seats in the House of Representatives and 40 seats in the 76-member Senate were up for election. The incumbent Liberal Party of Australia led by Prime Minister of Australia John Howard and coalition partner the National Party of Australia led by John Anderson defeated the opposition Australian Labor Party led by Mark Latham.

Until 2019, this was the most recent federal election in which the leader of the winning party would complete a full term of Parliament as Prime Minister. Also until, 2022 this was the most recent federal election in which both leaders were from the same city area. Future Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull entered Parliament in this election.

== Pre-election issues ==

In the wake of the 2002 Bali Bombings and the 2001 World Trade Center attacks, the Howard government along with the Blair and Bush governments, initiated combat operations in Afghanistan and an alliance for invading Iraq, these issues divided Labor voters who were disproportionately anti-war, flipping those votes from Labor and to the Greens. The second issue was the ongoing and continued worsening of the Millennium Drought continued to bolster support for the Nationals water management policies of the Murray-Darling river system, diverting focus away from rural and inner-city community water supplies and focusing on Regional and Farmland water supplies.

==Campaign==

The Prime Minister, John Howard, announced the election at a press conference in Canberra on 29 August, after meeting the Governor-General, Major General Michael Jeffery, at Government House.

=== Opening shots: &quot;who do you trust?&quot; ===

Trust was a central theme of both the Liberal and Labor campaign platforms. In a press conference announcing that the election had been called for October 9th, Howard asked &quot;Who do you trust to keep the economy strong and protect family living standards?&quot; &quot;Who do you trust to keep interest rates low? Who do you trust to lead the fight on Australia&#x27;s behalf against international terrorism?&quot;

Howard, who turned 65 in July, declined to answer questions about whether he would serve a full three-year term if his government was re-elected. &quot;I will serve as long as my party wants me to,&quot; he said.

At a press conference in Sydney half an hour after Howard&#x27;s announcement, Opposition Leader Mark Latham welcomed the election, saying the Howard government had been in power too long. He said the main issue would be truth in government. &quot;We&#x27;ve had too much dishonesty from the Howard Government&quot;, he said. &quot;The election is about trust. The Government has been dishonest for too long.&quot;

=== Labor starts ahead in national opinion polls ===

The campaign began with Labor leading in all published national opinion polls. On 31 August, Newspoll published in &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper gave Labor a lead of 52% to 48% nationwide, which would translate into a comfortable win for Labor in terms of seats. Most commentators, however, expected the election to be very close, pointing out that Labor was also ahead in the polls at the comparable point of the 1998 election, which Howard won.
Howard had also consistently out-polled Latham as preferred Prime Minister by an average of 11.7 percentage points in polls taken this year.

=== After the first week, the Coalition draws ahead ===

After the first week of campaigning, a Newspoll conducted for News Corporation newspapers indicated that the Coalition held a lead on a two-party-preferred basis of 52% to 48% in the government&#x27;s 12 most marginal held seats. To secure government in its own right, Labor needed to win twelve more seats than in the 2001 election. In the same poll, John Howard increased his lead over Mark Latham as preferred Prime Minister by four points. The Taverner Research poll conducted for &quot;The Sun-Herald&quot; newspaper revealed that younger voters were more likely to support Labor, with 41% of those aged 18 to 24 supporting Labor, compared with 36% who support the Coalition.

=== A terrorist attack on the Australian embassy in Jakarta marks the second week ===

On 9 September, during the second week of campaigning the election was rocked by a terrorist attack on the Australian embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia. John Howard expressed his &quot;utter dismay at this event&quot; and dispatched Foreign Minister Alexander Downer to Jakarta to assist in the investigation. Mark Latham committed the Labor party&#x27;s &quot;full support to all efforts by the Australian and Indonesian governments to ensure that happens&quot;. The parties reached an agreement that campaigning would cease for 10 September out of respect for the victims of this attack and that this would be in addition to the cessation of campaigning already agreed upon for 11 September in remembrance of the terrorist attacks in 2001.

=== The leaders debate and the worm turns in Latham&#x27;s favour ===

A debate between John Howard and Mark Latham was televised commercial-free on the Nine Network at 7:30pm on Sunday 12 September. In a change from previous election debates, which involved a single moderator, the leaders were questioned by a five-member panel representing each of the major media groups in Australia. There was a representative from commercial television (Laurie Oakes), the ABC (Jim Middleton), News Limited (Malcolm Farr), John Fairfax Holdings (Michelle Grattan) and radio (Neil Mitchell). After an opening address, Howard and Latham responded to questions posed by the panel and had the opportunity to make a closing statement. The Nine Network permitted other television organisations to transmit the feed, but only the ABC chose to.

The debate was followed (only on the Nine Network) by an analysis of the leaders&#x27; performance by the &quot;worm&quot;. The worm works by analysing the approval or disapproval of a select group of undecided voters to each statement that a leader makes. Throughout the debate, according to the worm, Latham performed strongly and Howard performed poorly. A final poll of the focus group found that 67% of the focus group believed that Latham won the debate and that 33% of the focus group believed that Howard won. Major media outlets generally agreed that Latham had won the debate, although they pointed out that with no further debates scheduled and nearly four weeks of the campaign remaining, Latham&#x27;s gain in the momentum from the debate was unlikely to be decisive. Political commentators noted that the 2001 election debate, between Howard and then opposition leader Kim Beazley, gave the same worm results yet Labor still lost that election.

=== At the midpoint, it is too close to call ===

By the midpoint of the campaign, after Labor had released its policies on taxation and education, polls showed that the election was still too close to call. The Newspoll in &quot;The Australian&quot;, showed (21 September) Labor leading with 52.5% of the two-party-preferred vote. The ACNielsen poll published in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;The Age&quot; showed the Coalition ahead on 52%. The Morgan poll, which has a poor recent record of predicting federal elections, showed Labor ahead with 53% on the weekend of 18–19 September. A Galaxy Poll in the Melbourne &quot;Herald Sun&quot; showed the Coalition ahead with 51%, but showed Labor gaining ground.

Despite Latham&#x27;s strong performance in the debate, most political commentators argued that he had not gained a clear advantage over Howard. They pointed to anomalies in Labor&#x27;s tax policy and the controversy surrounding Labor&#x27;s policy of reducing government funding to some non-government schools as issues which Howard was successfully exploiting.

John Howard and John Anderson launched the Coalition election campaign at a joint function in Brisbane on 26 September. Howard&#x27;s policy speech can be read at the Liberal Party website. Anderson&#x27;s policy speech can be read at the National Party website.

Mark Latham&#x27;s policy speech was delivered, also in Brisbane, on 29 September.

=== Contradictory polls in the fourth week ===

During the fourth week of the campaign contradictory polls continued to appear. The ACNielsen poll published in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;The Age&quot; on 25 September showed the Coalition ahead with 54%, which would translate into a large majority for the government. The Newspoll in &quot;The Australian&quot; on 28 September showed Labor ahead with 52%, which would give Labor a comfortable majority.

=== Tasmanian forests erupt as the main issue during the last week ===
In the last days of the campaign the environment policies regarding the logging of Tasmania&#x27;s old-growth forests were released by both major parties, but too late for the Greens to adjust their preference flows on how-to-vote cards in most electorates as the majority were already printed. In the game of &quot;cat and mouse&quot; on Tasmanian forest policy between Mark Latham and John Howard, Latham eventually lost out when Dick Adams (Labor member for the Tasmanian seat of Lyons), Tasmanian Labor Premier Paul Lennon and CFMEU&#x27;s Tasmanian secretary Scott McLean all attacked Latham&#x27;s forest policy. At a timber workers&#x27; rally on the day Labor&#x27;s forestry policy was announced, Scott McLean asked those gathered to pass a resolution of no confidence in Mr Latham&#x27;s ability to lead the country. Michael O&#x27;Connor, assistant national secretary of the CFMEU said the Coalition&#x27;s forest policy represented a much better deal for his members than Labor&#x27;s policy. Australian Labor Party national president Carmen Lawrence later said that &quot;Labor has only itself to blame for the backlash over its forestry policy&quot; and that it was a strategic mistake to release the policy so late in the election campaign. She stated that she was disappointed in criticism from within the ALP and union movement, and that the party did not leave itself enough time to sell the package.

Treasury and the Department of Finance reported on the validity of Labor&#x27;s costings of their promises. They claimed to identify a different flaw to that identified by Liberal Treasurer Costello, but overall Labor was satisfied with the report.

=== The handshake ===

On the morning of 8 October, the day before the election, a television crew filmed Latham and Howard shaking hands as they crossed paths outside an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio studio in Sydney. The footage showed Latham appearing to draw Howard towards him and tower over his shorter opponent. The incident received wide media coverage and, while Latham claimed to have been attempting to get revenge for Howard squeezing his wife&#x27;s hand too hard at a press function, it was variously reported as being &quot;aggressive&quot;, &quot;bullying&quot; and &quot;intimidating&quot; on the part of Latham. The Liberal Party campaign director, Brian Loughnane, later said this incident generated more feedback to Liberal headquarters than anything else during the six-week campaign, and that it &quot;brought together all the doubts and hesitations that people had about Mark Latham&quot;. Latham disputes the impact of this incident, however, having described it as a &quot;Tory gee-up: we got close to each other, sure, but otherwise it was a regulation man&#x27;s handshake. It&#x27;s silly to say it cost us votes – my numbers spiked in the last night of our polling.&quot; (&quot;Latham Diaries&quot;, p. 369) According to Latham&#x27;s account of events, Latham came in close to Howard for the handshake to prevent Howard shaking with his arm rather than his wrist.

=== Final opinion polls are not conclusive ===

The final opinion polls continued to be somewhat contradictory, with Newspoll showing a 50–50 tie and the Fairfax papers reporting 54–46 to the Coalition. Most Australian major daily newspaper editorials backed a return of the Howard government, with the notable exceptions of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, which backed neither party, and &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;, which backed Labor.

== Preference deals ==

As in all Australian elections, the flow of preferences from minor parties can be crucial in determining the outcome. The close of nominations was followed by a period of bargaining among the parties. Howard made a pitch for the preferences of the Australian Greens by appearing to offer concessions on the issue of logging in old-growth forests in Tasmania, and the Coalition directed its preferences to the Greens ahead of Labor in the Senate, but the Greens nevertheless decided to allocate preferences to Labor in most electorates. In exchange, Labor agreed to direct its preferences in the Senate to the Greens ahead of the Democrats (but critically, not ahead of other minor parties), increasing the chances that the Greens would displace Australian Democrats Senators in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia.

The Democrats in turn did a preference deal with the Family First Party, which angered some Democrats supporters who viewed Family First&#x27;s policies as incompatible with the Democrats&#x27;.

=== The effect of preference deals on Senate outcomes ===

In Victoria, Family First, the Christian Democrats and the DLP allocated their senate preferences to Labor, to help ensure the re-election of the number three Labor Senate candidate, Jacinta Collins, a Catholic who has conservative views on some social issues such as abortion. In exchange, Labor gave its Senate preferences in Victoria to Family First ahead of the Greens, expecting Family First to be eliminated before these preferences were distributed. In the event, however, Labor and Democrat preferences helped Family First&#x27;s Steve Fielding beat the Greens&#x27; David Risstrom to win the last Victorian Senate seat and become Family First&#x27;s first federal parliamentarian. This outcome generated some controversy and highlighted a lack of transparency in preference deals. Family First were elected in Victoria after receiving 1.88% of the vote, even though the Greens had the largest minor party share of the vote with 8.8%. In Australia, 95% of voters vote &quot;above the line&quot; in the Senate. Many &quot;above the line&quot; voters do not access preference allocation listings, although they are available in polling booths and on the AEC website, so they are therefore unaware of where their vote may go. The result was one Family First, three Liberal and two Labor Senators elected in Victoria.

In Tasmania, Family First and the Democrats also directed their Senate preferences to Labor, apparently to preclude the possibility of the Liberals winning a majority in the Senate and thus reducing the influence of the minor parties. The Australian Greens&#x27; Christine Milne appeared at risk of losing her Senate seat to a Family First candidate shortly after election night, despite nearly obtaining the full required quota of primary votes. However, strong performance on postal and prepoll votes improved Milne&#x27;s position. It was only the high incidence of &quot;below the line&quot; voting in Tasmania that negated the effect of the preference swap deal between Labor and Family First. The result was one Green, three Liberal and two Labor Senators elected in Tasmania.

In New South Wales, Democrat preferences flowing to Labor rather than the Greens were instrumental in Labor&#x27;s winning of the last Senate seat. Had Democrat preferences flown to the Greens rather than Liberals for Forests and the Christian Democrats, then the final vacancy would have been won by the Greens&#x27; John Kaye. The scale of Glenn Druery&#x27;s (of the Liberals for Forests party) preference deals was revealed by the large number of ticket votes distributed when he was eliminated from the count. He gained preferences from a wide range of minor parties such as the Ex-Service Service and Veterans Party, the Outdoor Recreation Party, and the Non-Custodial Parents Party. Liberals for Forests also gained the preferences of two leftish parties – the Progressive Labour Party and the HEMP Party. When Druery was eventually excluded, these preferences flowed to the Greens, but the Greens would rather have received the preferences earlier in the count. In the end, three Liberal/National Senators and three Labor Senators were elected in New South Wales.

In Western Australia, the Greens&#x27; Rachel Siewert was elected to the final vacancy after the final Labor candidate was excluded. This was a gain for the Greens at the expense of the Democrats Brian Greig. While the Democrats had done a preference swap with Family First, the deal in Western Australia did not include the Christian Democrats. As a result, when the Australian Democrats were excluded from the count, their preferences flowed to the Greens, putting them on track for the final vacancy. The result was one Green, three Liberal and two Labor Senators elected in Western Australia.

In South Australia, the Australian Democrats negotiated a crucial preference swap with Family First that prevented the Greens winning the final vacancy. If the Democrats had polled better, they would have collected Family First and Liberal preferences and won the final vacancy. Former Democrat Leader Meg Lees also contested the Senate in South Australia, but was eliminated late in the count. However, Lees did have some impact on the outcome, as there were large numbers of below the line preferences for both the Progressive Alliance (as well as One Nation) which were widely spread rather than flowing to the Democrats. When the Democrats were excluded, preferences flowed to Family First which prevented the Greens&#x27; Brian Noone passing the third Labor candidate. This resulted in a seat that could otherwise have been won by the Greens instead being won by Labor on Green preferences. The flow of One Nation preferences to Labor made it impossible for either Family First or the Liberal Party to win the final vacancy. Labor&#x27;s Dana Wortley was elected to the final vacancy. The result in South Australia was split 3 Liberal, 3 Labor.

In Queensland, Pauline Hanson attracted 38,000 below the line votes and pulled away from One Nation. Preferences from the Fishing Party kept the National Party&#x27;s Barnaby Joyce ahead of Family First and Pauline Hanson. Joyce then unexpectedly won the fifth vacancy ahead of the Liberal Party. The sixth and last vacancy was then won by Liberal Russell Trood. The outcome was 1 National, 3 Liberals and 2 Labor.

The election of both Barnaby Joyce and Russell Trood to the Senate in Queensland resulted in the Coalition gaining control of the Senate and was confirmed by the National Party&#x27;s Senate Leader Ron Boswell&#x27;s in a televised telephone call to Prime Minister John Howard. This result was not widely predicted prior to the election.

=== The effect of preference deals on House of Representatives and national outcomes ===

Despite constant media attention on preference deals, and a widely held belief that the two party preferred result for the election would be close, the Newspoll figures during the three months prior to the election showed little alteration in the first preference margin between the parties, nor was there any evidence of any voter volatility. The figures suggested, then, that as the Coalition&#x27;s first preference vote was healthy, the most likely result was a Government victory. This was born out in the election results when the Liberal first preference vote of 40.5 per cent was 3.4 percentage points higher than in 2001, while Labor&#x27;s first-preference vote of 37.6 per cent was its lowest since the elections of 1931 and 1934. Preference flows from minor parties are much more likely to affect an election outcome when the two major parties are close. The collapse of Labor&#x27;s primary vote therefore negated this effect, even though 61 out of 150 House of Representatives seats were decided on preferences.

The national outcome of minor party preference distributions (in order of number primary votes received) is summarised in the following table:

==Party leaders==

* John Howard had been an MP since 1974, leader of the Liberal Party since 1995 (he was previously leader from 1985 to 1989), and Prime Minister since March 1996. He turned 65 in July 2004, and is more than 20 years older than Mark Latham. Howard is by far the most experienced politician in Australian federal politics and is considered a master of political strategy, a reputation which was enhanced during the 2004 campaign. Although most commentators agreed that he did not perform well in the debate with Latham, his dogged campaigning on interest rates, economic certainty and national security was effective in persuading voters in marginal seats to stick with the Coalition.
* John Anderson had been an MP since 1988 and leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Minister since 1999. Although talented and personable, he was unable to stem the long-term decline in the Nationals&#x27; rural electoral base. During 2003 he considered retiring from Parliament at this election, but was persuaded not to. Despite his personal standing, the Nationals lost another seat (Richmond) and struggled to win a Senate spot in Queensland. Anderson stepped down as leader in July 2005.
* Mark Latham had been an MP since 1994 and was elected leader of the Australian Labor Party in December 2003. Latham initially made a good impression, but a series of controversies during 2004 caused much criticism of his alleged inconsistency and volatility. His campaign was aggressive and colourful, with a series of bold policy announcements late in the campaign. This galvanised Labor&#x27;s base but many commentators felt that Latham&#x27;s policies and personality alienated middle-class voters. In retrospect Labor&#x27;s forests policy was a major miscalculation, costing two seats in Tasmania. Latham also failed to effectively counter Howard&#x27;s campaign on interest rates. Latham resigned for health reasons in January 2005 from both his position as Leader of the Opposition and as Member for Werriwa in the House of Representatives.
* Andrew Bartlett had been a Senator since 1997 and leader of the Australian Democrats since 2002 when Natasha Stott Despoja stood down from the position. The efforts to revive the Democrats&#x27; public support were unsuccessful. A widely publicised incident in December 2003 where he confronted Liberal Senator Jeannie Ferris while exiting the Senate chamber did not help these efforts. The Democrats&#x27; election result in 2004 was the worst in the party&#x27;s history to that time. He chose not to recontest the leadership after that election, and Senator Lyn Allison took on the leadership role.
* Bob Brown had been a Senator and the informal leader of the Australian Greens since 1996. By opposing Australia&#x27;s participation in the Iraq War he established himself as the most prominent figure of the Australian left. But media predictions that the Greens would greatly increase their vote and win a Senate seat in every state, or even win House seats, were not realised. Although the Greens took some votes from the Democrats, many flowed to other parties and the predicted big inroads into Labor&#x27;s base vote did not occur.

==Disclosure==
Dates for financial disclosure for the 2004 Federal election were specified by the Australian Electoral Commission. Broadcasters and publishers had to lodge their returns by 6 December, while candidates and Senate groups needed to lodge by 24 January 2005. This information was made available for public scrutiny on 28 March 2005.

==Results==
===House of Representatives ===




===Senate ===

==House of Representatives preference flows==

* The Nationals had candidates in 9 seats where three-cornered-contests existed, with 84.70% of preferences favouring the Liberal Party.
* The Greens contested all 150 electorates with preferences strongly favouring Labor (80.86%)
* Family First contested 109 electorates with preferences favouring the Liberal/National Coalition (66.57%)
* The Democrats contested 125 electorates with preferences slightly favouring Labor (58.91%)
* One Nation contested 77 electorates with preferences slightly favouring the Liberal/National Coalition (56.4%)

==Seats changing hands==
In the House of Representatives, the Coalition won eight seats from Labor: Bass (Tas), Bonner (Qld), Braddon (Tas), Greenway (NSW), Hasluck (WA), Kingston (SA), Stirling (WA) and Wakefield (SA). Labor won four seats from the Coalition: Adelaide (SA), Hindmarsh (SA), Parramatta (NSW) and Richmond (NSW). The Coalition thus had a net gain of four seats. The redistribution had also delivered them McMillan (Vic), formerly held by Christian Zahra of Labor and won by Liberal Russell Broadbent; and Bowman (Qld), formerly held by Labor&#x27;s Con Sciacca and won by Liberal Andrew Laming. Labor, meanwhile, received the new seat of Bonner (Qld) and the redistributed Wakefield (SA), both of which were lost to the Liberal Party. The Labor Party regained the seat of Cunningham, which had been lost to the Greens in a by-election in 2002.

==Analysis==
The Coalition parties won 46.7% of the primary vote, a gain of 3.7% over the 2001 election. The opposition Australian Labor Party polled 37.6%, a loss of 0.2 percentage points. The Australian Greens emerged as the most prominent minor party, polling 7.2%, a gain of 2.2 points. Both the Australian Democrats and One Nation had their vote greatly reduced. After a notional distribution of preferences, the Australian Electoral Commission estimated that the Coalition had polled 52.74% of the two-party-preferred vote, a gain of 1.7 points from 2001.

The Liberal Party won 74 seats, the National Party 12 seats and the Country Liberal Party (the Northern Territory branch of the Liberal Party) one seat, against the Labor opposition&#x27;s 60 seats. Three independent members were re-elected. The Coalition also won 39 seats in the 76-member Senate, making the Howard government the first government to have a majority in the Senate since 1981. The size of the government&#x27;s win was unexpected: few commentators had predicted that the coalition would actually increase its majority in the House of Representatives, and almost none had foreseen its gaining a majority in the Senate. Even Howard had described that feat as &quot;a big ask&quot;.

The election result was a triumph for Howard, who in December 2004 became Australia&#x27;s second-longest serving Prime Minister, and who saw the election result as a vindication of his policies, particularly his decision to join in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The results were a setback for the Labor leader, Mark Latham, and contributed to his resignation in January 2005 after assuming the leadership from Simon Crean in 2003. The defeat made Labor&#x27;s task more difficult: a provisional pendulum for the House of Representatives, showed that Labor would need to win 16 seats to win the following election. However, Kim Beazley said that the accession of Latham to the ALP leadership, in December 2003, had rescued the party from a much heavier defeat. Beazley stated that polling a year before the election indicated that the ALP would lose &quot;25–30 seats&quot; in the House of Representatives. Instead the party lost a net four seats in the House, a swing of 0.21 percentage points. There was also a 1.1-point swing &quot;to&quot; the ALP in the Senate. The Coalition gaining control of the Senate was enabled by a collapse in first preferences for the Australian Democrats and One Nation.

Members and Senators defeated in the election include Larry Anthony, the National Party Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, defeated in Richmond, New South Wales; former Labor minister Con Sciacca, defeated in Bonner, Queensland; Liberal Parliamentary Secretaries Trish Worth (Adelaide, South Australia) and Ross Cameron (Parramatta, New South Wales); and Democrat Senators Aden Ridgeway (the only indigenous member of the outgoing Parliament), Brian Greig and John Cherry. Liberal Senator John Tierney (New South Wales), who was dropped to number four on the Coalition Senate ticket, was also defeated.

Celebrity candidates Peter Garrett (Labor, Kingsford Smith, New South Wales) and Malcolm Turnbull (Liberal, Wentworth, New South Wales) easily won their contests. Prominent clergyman Fred Nile failed to win a Senate seat in New South Wales. The first Muslim candidate to be endorsed by a major party in Australia, Ed Husic, failed to win the seat of Greenway, New South Wales, for Labor. The former One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, failed in her bid to win a Senate seat in Queensland as an independent.

Minor parties had mixed results. The Australian Democrats polled their lowest vote since their creation in 1977, and did not retain any of the three Senate seats they were defending. The Australian Greens won their first Senate seat in Western Australia and retained the Seat they were defending in Tasmania. They did not achieve a widely expected Senate Seat in Victoria, due to fellow progressive parties, the Australian Labor Party and The Australian Democrats, as well as some micro parties, joining with the conservative parties in a preference deal with far-right evangelist Christian party Family First, which despite a popular vote of just 1.7% received so many preferences from the unsuccessful Candidates of other parties that it eventually overtook the Greens David Risstrom&#x27;s 7.4% vote and claimed that Senate Seat. As predicted, the Greens did not gain Senate seats in Queensland or South Australia, partly because of similar preference deals by fellow progressive parties, but also because of a traditionally lower vote in these States. Predictably, the Greens lost their first and (at the time) only Lower House seat of Cunningham, which they had gained by way of an electoral anomaly at the 2002 by-election in that Seat, which when The Liberal Party did not provide a Candidate, caused atypical voting patterns, overwhelmingly amongst voters who would normally have voted for The Liberals and did not want to vote for their traditional nemeses, The Labor Party.

The Australian Progressive Alliance leader, Senator Meg Lees, and the One Nation parliamentary leader, Senator Len Harris, lost their seats. One Nation&#x27;s vote in the House of Representatives collapsed. The Christian Democratic Party, the Citizens Electoral Council, the Democratic Labor Party, the Progressive Labour Party and the Socialist Alliance all failed to make any impact. The Family First Party polled 2% of the vote nationally, and their candidate Steve Fielding won a Senate seat in Victoria.

<text>The International Development Research Centre (IDRC; , &quot;CRDI&quot;) is a Canadian federal Crown corporation. As part of Canada&#x27;s foreign affairs and development efforts, IDRC champions and funds research and innovation within and alongside developing regions to drive global change. IDRC invests in high-quality research in developing countries, shares knowledge with researchers and policymakers for greater uptake and use, and mobilizes global alliances to build a more sustainable and inclusive world.

<text>The following notable companies are based in New Zealand. For further information on the types of business entities in this country and their abbreviations, see &quot;Business entities in New Zealand&quot;.

New Zealand is a wealthy country, with a relatively high GDP per capita and a relatively low rate of poverty. Since the 1980s, New Zealand has transformed from an agrarian, regulated economy to a more industrialised, free market economy that can compete globally. Since 1984, government subsidies including for agriculture have been eliminated; import regulations have been liberalised; exchange rates have been freely floated; controls on interest rates, wages, and prices have been removed; and marginal rates of taxation reduced. The restructuring and sale of state-owned enterprises in the 1990s reduced government&#x27;s role in the economy. Many of the largest companies lost ground and new enterprises were established. New Zealand companies are dependent on international trade, mainly with Australia, the European Union, the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Canada. The major capital market is the New Zealand Exchange, known as the NZX.

== Largest firms==
95% of the companies entirely within New Zealand are classed as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The Financial Reporting Act 1993 defines a large company as one that satisfied at least one of two criteria:
*Total assets of the entity and its subsidiaries (if any) exceed NZ$60 million
*Total revenue of the entity and its subsidiaries (if any) exceeds NZ$30 million.

Several of the largest firms are listed below:

== Notable firms ==
This list includes notable companies with primary headquarters located in the country. The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark taxonomy. Organisations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct.

For convenience, the word &quot;Limited&quot;, which every company registered or re-registered under the Companies Act 1993 must have at the end of its name, is reduced to the common and universally recognised term &quot;Ltd&quot;, which is a specifically permitted abbreviation under the Act. In the New Zealand registration system, unlike those of some other countries, the term &quot;Incorporated&quot; is restricted to societies (generally nonprofit) under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908.

<doc id="456678" wikidata="Q318727" url="?curid=456678" title="Municipalities of Nicaragua">
<text>The 15 departments and 2 autonomous regions of Nicaragua are divided into 153 municipalities. The formation and dissolution of municipalities is governed by the Law of Municipalities (in Spanish: &quot;Ley No.40 - Ley de Municipalidades&quot;), drafted and approved by the National Assembly on July 2. 1988.

The municipalities are responsible for planning and urban development, collection of municipal taxes, maintenance of public utilities and other services, such as parks, sewerage and public cemeteries. Whilst municipal governments may not be responsible for large highways, small roads and tracks usually come under their control. Additionally, municipal governments may issue permits for the operation of urban and intermunicipal bus services.

Other functions of municipal governments include the establishment of libraries, museums, municipal bands, zoos, the promotion of traditional and folklore festivals and various activities promoting education, culture, sports and tourism in the municipality.

== List of municipalities ==

Notes:

*&quot;Year&quot; refers to the date the municipality was created. In some cases, the year refers to the date of the foundation of the municipality seat. This is particularly the case of colonial cities.

<doc id="456679" wikidata="Q690347" url="?curid=456679" title="Rock of Gibraltar">
<text>The Rock of Gibraltar (from the Arabic name Jabal Ṭāriq , meaning &quot;Mountain of Tariq&quot;) is a monolithic limestone mountain high dominating the western entrance to the Mediterranean Sea. It is situated near the end of a narrow long promontory stretching due south into the Mediterranean Sea and is located within the British territory of Gibraltar, and is 27 km north-east of Tarifa, Spain, the southwestern tip of Europe on the Iberian Peninsula. The rock serves as an impregnable fortress and contains a labyrinthine network of man-made tunnels known as the Tunnels of Gibraltar. Most of the Rock&#x27;s upper area comprises a nature reserve which is home to about 300 Barbary macaques. It is a major tourist attraction.

The Rock of Gibraltar, the northern of the two historic Pillars of Hercules, was known to the Romans as &quot;Mons Calpe&quot; (&quot;Mount Calpe&quot;), the other southern pillar on the African side of the Strait of Gibraltar being &quot;Mons Abila&quot;, identified today as either Monte Hacho or Jebel Musa, with a distance of about 27 km between the two &quot;pillars&quot;. According to ancient legend fostered by the Greeks and the Phoenicians, and later adopted by the Romans, the two pillars marked the western limit of the known world, although the Phoenicians had sailed beyond this point into the Atlantic Ocean, both northward and southward.

==Geology==

The Rock of Gibraltar is a monolithic promontory. The Main Ridge has a sharp crest with peaks over above sea level, formed by Early Jurassic limestones and dolomites. It is a deeply eroded and highly faulted limb of an overturned fold. The sedimentary strata composing the Rock of Gibraltar are overturned, with the oldest strata overlying the youngest strata. These strata are the Catalan Bay Shale Formation (youngest), Gibraltar Limestone, Little Bay Shale Formation (oldest), and Dockyard Shale Formation (age unknown). These strata are noticeably faulted and deformed.

Predominantly of shale, the Catalan Bay Shale Formation also contains thick units composed of either brown calcareous sandstone, soft shaly sandstone interbedded with bluish-black limestone, and interlayered greenish-gray marls and dark gray cherts. The Catalan Bay Shale Formation contains unidentifiable echinoid spines and belemnite fragments and infrequent Early Jurassic (Middle Lias) ammonites.

The Gibraltar limestone consists of greyish-white or pale-gray compact, and sometime finely crystalline, medium to thick bedded limestones and dolomites that locally contain chert seams. This formation comprises about three quarters of the Rock of Gibraltar. Geologists have found various poorly preserved and badly eroded and rolled marine fossils within it. The fossils found in the Gibraltar limestone include various brachiopods, corals, echinoid fragments, gastropods, pelecypods, and stromatolites. These fossils indicate an Early Jurassic age (Lower Lias) for the deposition of the Gibraltar limestone.

The Little Bay and Dockyard shale formations form a very minor part of the Rock of Gibraltar. The Little Bay Shale Formation consists of dark bluish-gray, unfossiliferous shale, which is interbedded with thin layers of grit, mudstone, and limestone. It predates the Gibraltar limestone. The Dockyard Shale Formation is an undescribed variegated shale of unknown age that lies buried beneath the Gibraltar&#x27;s dockyard and coastal protection structures.

Although these geological formations were deposited during the early part of the Jurassic Period some 175–200 million years ago, their current appearance is due to far more recent events of about 5 million years ago. When the African tectonic plate collided tightly with the Eurasian Plate, the Mediterranean became a lake that, over the course of time, dried up during the Messinian salinity crisis. The Atlantic Ocean then broke through the Strait of Gibraltar, and the resultant flooding created the Mediterranean Sea. The Rock forms part of the Betic Cordillera, a mountain range that dominates southeastern Iberia. The local geology of the region has been uplifting the rock at roughly per year for the past 200,000 years (or a total uplift of around ), and for at least 50,000 years before that had been uplifted by per year for a combined uplift of about in the past 250,000 years.
Today, the Rock of Gibraltar forms a peninsula jutting out into the Strait of Gibraltar from the southern coast of Spain. The promontory is linked to the continent by means of a sandy tombolo with a maximum elevation of . To the north, the Rock rises vertically from sea level up to at Rock Gun Battery. The Rock&#x27;s highest point stands near the south end above the strait at O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s Battery. The Rock&#x27;s central peak, Signal Hill and the top station of the Gibraltar Cable Car, stands at an elevation of . The near-cliffs along the eastern side of the Rock drop down to a series of wind-blown sand slopes that date to the glaciations when sea levels were lower than today, and a sandy plain extended east from the base of the Rock. The western face, where the City of Gibraltar is located, is comparatively less steep.

Calcite, the mineral that makes up limestone, dissolves slowly in rainwater. Over time, this process can form caves. For this reason the Rock of Gibraltar contains over 100 caves. St. Michael&#x27;s Cave, located halfway up the western slope of the Rock, is the most prominent and is a popular tourist attraction.

Fossils of Neanderthals have been found at several sites in Gibraltar. In 1848, a Neanderthal woman&#x27;s skull was found at Forbes&#x27; Quarry, located on the north face of the Rock. However, its significance was not recognized until after the 1856 discovery of the type specimen in the Neander Valley. Excavations in Gorham&#x27;s Cave, located near sea level on the eastern side of the Rock, found evidence it was used by Neanderthals, and plant and animal remains in the cave gave evidence of Neanderthals&#x27; highly varied diet.

==Eastern Face==

The Eastern Face of the Rock comprises steep cliffs and scree slopes descending to the sea, allowing little space for human habitation. In modern times a road (Sir Herbert Miles Road, named after Lieutenant General Sir Herbert Miles, Governor of Gibraltar 1913-1918) has been cut into the shore, its southernmost part being through a tunnel (Dudley Ward Way, named after Sir Alfred Dudley Ward, Governor of Gibraltar 1962-1965) in the rock.
Towards the south-east end of the Rock close to sea-level is located Gorham&#x27;s Cave, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Fortification==
===Moorish Castle===

The Moorish Castle is a relic of Moorish rule over Gibraltar, which lasted for 710 years. It was built in the year AD 711, when the Berber chieftain Tariq ibn-Ziyad first landed on the rock that still bears his name. The 17th-century Muslim historian Al-Maqqari wrote that upon landing, Tariq burned his ships.

The principal building that remains is the Tower of Homage, a massive building of brick and very hard concrete called &quot;tapia&quot;. The upper part of the tower housed the former occupants&#x27; living apartments and Moorish bath.

===Galleries===
A unique feature of the Rock is its system of underground passages, known as the Galleries or the Great Siege Tunnels.

The first of these was dug towards the end of the Great Siege of Gibraltar, which lasted from 1779 to 1783. General Elliot, afterwards Lord Heathfield, who commanded the garrison throughout the siege, was anxious to bring flanking fire on the Spanish batteries in the plain below the North face of the Rock. On the suggestion of Sergeant-Major Henry Ince of the Royal Engineers, he had a tunnel bored from a point above Willis&#x27;s Battery to communicate with the Notch, a natural projection from the North face. The plan was to mount a battery there. There was no intention at first of making embrasures in this tunnel, but an opening was found necessary for ventilation; as soon as it had been made a gun was mounted in it. By the end of the siege, the British had constructed six such embrasures, and mounted four guns.

The Galleries, which tourists may visit, were a later development of the same idea and were finished in 1797. They consist of a whole system of halls, embrasures, and passages, of a total length of nearly . From them, one may see a series of unique views of the Bay of Gibraltar, the isthmus, and Spain.

===Second World War onwards===

When World War II broke out in 1939, the authorities evacuated the civilian population to Morocco, the United Kingdom, Jamaica, and Madeira so that the military could fortify Gibraltar against a possible German attack. By 1942 there were over 30,000 British soldiers, sailors, and airmen on the Rock. They expanded the tunnel system and made the Rock a keystone in the defence of shipping routes to the Mediterranean.

In February 1997, it was revealed the British had a secret plan called Operation Tracer to conceal servicemen in tunnels beneath the Rock in case the Germans captured it. The team in the rock would have radio equipment with which to report enemy movements. A six-man team waited undercover at Gibraltar for two and a half years. The Germans never got close to capturing the rock and so the men were never sealed inside. The team was disbanded to resume civilian life when the war ended.

===Sayings===
The saying &quot;solid as the Rock of Gibraltar&quot; is used to describe an entity that is very safe or firm.

The motto of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment and Gibraltar itself is (Latin for &quot;No Enemy Shall Expel Us&quot;).

==Nature reserve==

Approximately 40% of Gibraltar&#x27;s land area was declared a nature reserve in 1993.

===Flora and fauna===
The flora and fauna of the Gibraltar Nature Reserve are of conservation interest and are protected by law. Within it is a range of animals and plants, but the highlights are the Barbary macaques (the famous &quot;Rock apes&quot;), the Barbary partridges, and flowers such as Gibraltar&#x27;s own chickweed, thyme and the Gibraltar candytuft. The Barbary macaques may have originated from an escape of North African animals transported to Spain; it is also possible that the original Gibraltar macaques are a remnant of populations that are known to have spread throughout Southern Europe during the Pliocene, up to 5.5 million years ago. Some animals of the Rock have been reintroduced by the Alameda Wildlife Conservation Park who have three Barbary macaques.

====Birds====
The Rock of Gibraltar, at the head of the Strait, is a prominent headland, which accumulates migrating birds during the passage periods. The vegetation on the Rock, unique in southern Iberia, provides a temporary home for many species of migratory birds that stop to rest and feed before continuing migration for their crossing over the sea and desert. In spring, they return to replenish before continuing their journeys to Western Europe, journeys which may take them as far as Greenland or Russia.

The Rock has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International, because it is a migratory bottleneck, or choke point, for an estimated 250,000 raptors that cross the Strait annually, and because it supports breeding populations of Barbary partridges and lesser kestrels.

<doc id="456682" wikidata="Q5142301" url="?curid=456682" title="Cold Lazarus">
<text>Cold Lazarus is a four-part British television drama written by Dennis Potter with the knowledge that he was dying of pancreatic cancer. It forms the second half of a pair with the television serial &quot;Karaoke&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;Karaoke&quot; and &quot;Cold Lazarus&quot; were filmed as a single production by the same team; both were directed by Renny Rye and feature Albert Finney as the writer Daniel Feeld. The plays were unique in being co-productions between the BBC and Channel 4, something Potter had expressly requested before his death.

Parts of &quot;Karaoke&quot; and &quot;Cold Lazarus&quot; were filmed in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, which is where Dennis Potter was born and raised, and children from local schools including St Briavels Parochial Primary School appeared in the film as extras in flashbacks.

==Plot==
&quot;Cold Lazarus&quot; is set in the 24th century, in a dystopian US-annexed Britain (a.k.a the 51st state) where the ruined streets are unsafe, and where society is run by American oligarchs in charge of powerful commercial corporations which run the US government and have annexed the British Isles. Experiences are almost all virtual, and anything deemed authentic (such as coffee and cigarettes) has either been banned or replaced by synthetic substitutes.

At a cryonics research institute in the former capital city of London, funded by the pharmaceuticals tycoon Martina Masdon, a group of scientists led by Dr. Emma Porlock is working on reviving the mind of the 20th-century writer Daniel Feeld, whose head was frozen after Feeld&#x27;s death shortly after the events of &quot;Karaoke.&quot;, but prior to the Y2K-caused world war 3 which lead to the future depicted, Unable to see any profit in the project, Masdon considers discontinuing it, but the media mogul David Siltz, who has been spying on Masdon, envisages making a fortune from broadcasting Feeld&#x27;s memories on TV, and proposes to Porlock that her team work for him.

Porlock is unaware that a member of her team, Fyodor Glazunov is a member of the resistance group RON (&#x27;Reality Or Nothing&#x27;), which attempts to undermine the reliance of society upon advanced technology by carrying out violent attacks. Glazunov identifies Kaya, another of Porlock&#x27;s team, as a potential recruit to his superior Andrew Milton, but Milton kills Kaya, believing her unsuitable. Angered by Kaya&#x27;s murder, Glazunov kills Milton. Porlock then discovers the truth about Glazunov but, to distract him from the possibility of killing her, consults with him about the Siltz deal. Glazunov approves of the broadcast of Feeld&#x27;s memories, which he believes might provoke a revolt against the &#x27;inauthentic&#x27; life propagated by the authorities. It is shortly after this that Porlock accepts Siltz&#x27;s offer, just as Masdon realises the potential of the Lazarus project.

As more of Feeld&#x27;s thoughts and memories are unearthed, it becomes evident not only that Feeld&#x27;s mind is conscious of its predicament, but also that Feeld is attempting to communicate with the scientists, and is pleading to be allowed to die. At this point Glazunov, Porlock and Luanda Partington (another long standing member of the team) begin to doubt the morality of their project. Another of their team, Watson, having been coerced into informing on his colleagues, unwittingly denounces Glazunov as a RON member and saboteur. Having been warned, Glazunov heads for the laboratory to put Feeld out of his misery. In the confrontation that ensues, Glazunov is able to kill Siltz, and, after a final communication with Feeld (in which they make eye contact), he destroys the laboratory, Feeld&#x27;s head, and himself, in the process.

==Cast==
*Albert Finney as Daniel Feeld
*Frances de la Tour as Emma Porlock
*Ciarán Hinds as Fyodor Glazunov

The series also featured an early TV appearance by Rupert Penry-Jones as a militiaman.

Additionally, some of the cast of &quot;Karaoke&quot; appear in Feeld&#x27;s flashbacks.

==Episodes==
*Episode 1: &quot;One&quot;. 26 May 1996. This first broadcast of this episode had an audience of 3.8 million people. Running time: 50 or 52 minutes.
*Episode 2: &quot;Two&quot;. 2 June 1996.
*Episode 3: &quot;Three&quot;. 9 June 1996.
*Episode 4: &quot;Four&quot;. 16 June 1996.

==Broadcast and release==
The show was first broadcast on Channel 4 in 1996 on Sunday evenings, with a repeat on BBC1 the following day.

The series was broadcast in the United States in 1997 on Bravo. The series had previously been offered to PBS.

Both series are available to watch online via the Channel 4 website. 

Both &quot;Karaoke&quot; and &quot;Cold Lazarus&quot; were released on DVD from Acorn Media in September 2010. The four episodes are embodied in two discs. The discs include menus and biographies.

==Reception==
Christpher Dunkley said that &quot;Cold Lazarus&quot; is &quot;astonishing&quot;.

==Legacy==
Many of the futuristic costumes made for the actors to wear in &quot;Cold Lazarus&quot; were later bought by the film company Wibbell Productions and subsequently used in the feature film &quot;The Vampires of Bloody Island&quot; in 2007. Wibbell later sold many of them individually to private collectors in 2013.

A spaceship prop, in 2023, was in Leighton Buzzard and for sale.

<text>Max Barry (born 18 March 1973) is an Australian author. He also maintains a blog on various topics, including politics. When he published his first novel, &quot;Syrup&quot;, he spelled his name &quot;Maxx&quot;, but subsequently has used &quot;Max&quot;.

Barry is also the creator of &quot;NationStates&quot;, an online game created to help advertise &quot;Jennifer Government&quot; that eventually evolved into its own online community. He is the owner of the website &quot;Tales of Corporate Oppression&quot;. He lives in Melbourne with his wife and daughters and worked as a marketer for Hewlett-Packard before he became a novelist. He also has his own website, maxbarry.com

In early 2004 Barry converted his web site to a blog and began regularly posting to it. In the November 2004 issue of the magazine &quot;Fast Company&quot; the novel &quot;Company&quot; was ranked at number 8 on a list of the top 100 &quot;people, ideas, and trends that will change how we work and live in 2005&quot;. Barry wrote the screenplay for &quot;Syrup,&quot; which was released in theatres on 7 June 2013. Universal Pictures has acquired screen rights to &quot;Company&quot;, which will be adapted by Steve Pink. &quot;Jennifer Government&quot; was optioned by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney&#x27;s now defunct Section Eight Productions. His book, &quot;Machine Man&quot;, initially was an online serial, but has since been updated and published in 2011 by Vintage Books. The film rights have been picked up by Mandalay Pictures.

<text>Kochis also spelt as Kuchis (Pashto: کوچۍ Kuchis) are pastoral nomads belonging primarily to the Ghilji Pashtuns. It is a social rather than ethnic grouping, although they have some of the characteristics of a distinct ethnic group. They live southern and eastern Afghanistan, the largest population of Kuchis is probably in Registan Desert in southern Afghanistan In the southern, western and northern regions of Afghanistan they are also referred to at times as maldar (Pashto: مالدار maldar, &quot;herd-owner&quot;), or Powindah. Some of the most notable Ghilji Kochi tribes include the Kharoti, Niazi, Andar, Akakhel, and nasar Ahmadzai. In the Pashto language, the terms are کوچۍ Kochai (singular) and کوچیان Kochian (plural). In the Persian language, کوچی &quot;Kochi&quot; and &quot;Kochiha&quot; are the singular and plural forms (respectively).

==Description==
The National Multi-sectoral Assessment of Kochi in 2004 estimated that there are about 2.4 million Kochis in Afghanistan, with around 1.5 million (60%) remaining fully nomadic; over 100,000 have been displaced due to natural disasters such as flood and drought in the past few years.

The nomads and semi-nomads, generally called &quot;Kuchi&quot; in Afghanistan, mostly keep sheep and goats. The produce of the animals (meat, dairy products, hair and wool) is exchanged or sold in order to purchase grain, vegetables, fruit and other products of settled life. In this way an extensive network of exchange has developed along the main routes annually followed by the nomads. The merchant &quot;Powindah&quot; (Ghilji) [or Ghilzai] Pashtuns used to move annually from the Afghanistan mountains to the valley of the Indus. These long-distance migrations were stopped in the early 1960s when the border with Afghanistan and Pakistan were closed, but many Kuchis are still allowed to cross as border officials recognize the Kuchi migrations which occur seasonally and allow them to pass even in times of political turmoil. In recent decades, migrations inside Afghanistan continue, although trucks are now often being used to transport livestock and family from one place to another.

==History==

Kochis historically abstained from politics, because they are nomadic, but under Afghanistan&#x27;s constitution, they were given ten seats in parliament. Provisions are written into the Afghanistan Constitution (Article 14) aimed at improving the welfare of Kochis, including provisions for housing, representation, and education. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, before the 30 years of war, Kochis owned 30 per cent of the country&#x27;s goats and sheep and most of the camels for years, and they were largely responsible for the supply of slaughter animals, wool, ghee and quroot to the national economy. 

Kochis were also favored by the Kings of Afghanistan, who were themselves ethnic Pashtuns, since the late 1880s. They were awarded &quot;firman,&quot; or royal proclamations, granting them use of summer pastures all over Afghanistan including the northern parts of the country. During the Taliban era, Kochis were a main factor and supporter of the Taliban and their leader Mullah Omar. As a result, the northern ethnic groups (Hazara, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Turkmens) have a long-standing distrust of the Kochi. This political dispute has been deepened over the decades of Kochi transhumance, whereby some Kochis became absentee landlords in their summer areas in the north through customary seizure procedures to attach debtors&#x27; land. However, the Kochis themselves see the northern minority groups as a non-Afghan race, and claims the Kochis were natives of northern Afghan region, and that during many years of invasion such as Genghis Khan and Timur, they escaped south.

In 2010 in western Kabul, when Kuchi refugees attempted to resettle on their ancestral lands, they clashed with local Hazara residents. The fighting continued for several days and resulted in casualties among both communities. 

Kochis have been identified by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan as one of the largest vulnerable populations in the country. As Afghanistan&#x27;s population grows, competing claims over summer pastures, both for rainfed cultivation and for grazing of the settled communities&#x27; livestock, have created conflict over land across central and northern Afghanistan. Paying head-count fees for each animal crossing someone else&#x27;s property is exacting a harsh economic toll on the Kochi way of life, one that is already having to contend with recurrent droughts that are now occurring with increasing frequency. There are communities of Pashtun Kochi origin in other parts of the world as well, including in the Caribbean, Africa and Europe. In Pakistan, some Kochis are found in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

==In Popular Culture==

James A. Michener describes Kochi life in his 1963 novel Caravans, set in 1946 Afghanistan.

<doc id="456706" wikidata="Q1480392" url="?curid=456706" title="Rebirth (Buddhism)">
<text>Rebirth in Buddhism refers to the teaching that the actions of a sentient being lead to a new existence after death, in an endless cycle called &quot;saṃsāra&quot;. This cycle is considered to be &quot;dukkha&quot;, unsatisfactory and painful. The cycle stops only if Nirvana (liberation) is achieved by insight and the extinguishing of craving. Rebirth is one of the foundational doctrines of Buddhism, along with karma and Nirvana. Rebirth was a key teaching of early Buddhism along with the doctrine of karma (which it shared with early Indian religions like Jainism). In Early Buddhist Sources, the Buddha claims to have knowledge of his many past lives. Rebirth and other concepts of the afterlife have been interpreted in different ways by different Buddhist traditions.

The rebirth doctrine, sometimes referred to as reincarnation or transmigration, asserts that rebirth takes place in one of the six realms of samsara, the realms of gods, demi-gods, humans, the animal realm, the ghost realm and hell realms. Rebirth, as stated by various Buddhist traditions, is determined by karma, with good realms favored by &quot;kusala karma&quot; (good or skillful karma), while a rebirth in evil realms is a consequence of &quot;akusala karma&quot; (bad or unskillful karma). While nirvana is the ultimate goal of Buddhist teaching, much of traditional Buddhist practice has been centered on gaining merit and merit transfer, whereby one gains rebirth in the good realms and avoids rebirth in the evil realms.

The rebirth doctrine has been a subject of scholarly studies within Buddhism since ancient times, particularly in reconciling the rebirth doctrine with its anti-essentialist &quot;anatman&quot; (not-self) doctrine. The various Buddhist traditions throughout history have disagreed on what it is in a person that is reborn, as well as how quickly the rebirth occurs after each death.

Some Buddhist traditions assert that &quot;vijñana&quot; (consciousness), though constantly changing, exists as a continuum or stream (&quot;santana&quot;) and is what undergoes rebirth. Some traditions like Theravada assert that rebirth occurs immediately and that no &quot;thing&quot; (not even consciousness) moves across lives to be reborn (though there is a causal link, like when a seal is imprinted on wax). Other Buddhist traditions such as Tibetan Buddhism posit an interim existence (&quot;bardo&quot;) between death and rebirth, which may last as long as 49 days. This belief drives Tibetan funerary rituals. A now defunct Buddhist tradition called Pudgalavada asserted there was an inexpressible personal entity (&quot;pudgala&quot;) which migrates from one life to another.

== Buddhist terminology and doctrine ==
There is no word corresponding exactly to the English terms &quot;rebirth&quot;, &quot;metempsychosis&quot;, &quot;transmigration&quot; or &quot;reincarnation&quot; in the traditional Buddhist languages of Pāli and Sanskrit. Rebirth is referred to by various terms, representing an essential step in the endless cycle of &quot;samsara&quot;, terms such as &quot;re-becoming&quot; or &quot;becoming again&quot; (Sanskrit: punarbhava, Pali: punabbhava), re-born (&quot;punarjanman&quot;), re-death (&quot;punarmrityu&quot;), or sometimes just &quot;becoming&quot; (Pali/Sanskrit: bhava), while the state one is born into, the individual process of being born or coming into the world in any way, is referred to simply as &quot;birth&quot; (Pali/Sanskrit: jāti). The entire universal process of beings being reborn again and again is called &quot;wandering about&quot; (Pali/Sanskrit: ).

Some English-speaking Buddhists prefer the term &quot;rebirth&quot; or &quot;re-becoming&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;punarbhava&quot;; Pali: &quot;punabbhava&quot;) to &quot;reincarnation&quot; as they take the latter to imply an entity (soul) that is reborn. Buddhism denies there is any such soul or self in a living being, but does assert that there is a cycle of transmigration consisting of rebirth and redeath as the fundamental nature of existence.

== Historical context ==
Before the time of the Buddha, many ideas on the nature of existence, birth and death were in vogue. The early layers of the Vedas do not mention the doctrine of Karma and rebirth but mention the belief in an afterlife. According to Sayers, these earliest layers of the Vedic literature show ancestor worship and rites such as &quot;sraddha&quot; (offering food to the ancestors). The later Vedic texts such as the &quot;Aranyakas&quot; and the &quot;Upanisads&quot; show a different soteriology based on reincarnation, they show little concern with ancestor rites, and they begin to philosophically interpret the earlier rituals. The idea of reincarnation and karma have roots in the Upanishads of the late Vedic period, predating the Buddha and the Mahavira. The Sramana schools affirmed the idea of soul, karma and cycle of rebirth. The competing Indian materialist schools denied the idea of soul, karma and rebirth, asserting instead that there is just one life, there is no rebirth, and death marks complete annihilation. From these diverse views, Buddha accepted the premises and concepts related to rebirth, but introduced innovations. According to various Buddhist scriptures, Buddha believed in other worlds,

Buddha also asserted that there is karma, which influences the future suffering through the cycle of rebirth, but added that there is a way to end the cycle of karmic rebirths through &quot;nirvana&quot;. The Buddha introduced the concept that there is no soul (self) tying the cycle of rebirths, in contrast to themes asserted by various Hindu and Jaina traditions, and this central concept in Buddhism is called &quot;anattā&quot;; Buddha also affirmed the idea that all compounded things are subject to dissolution at death or &quot;anicca&quot;. The Buddha&#x27;s detailed conception of the connections between action (karma), rebirth and causality is set out in the twelve links of dependent origination.

== In Early Buddhism ==
There are several references to rebirth in the Early Buddhist texts (henceforth EBTs). Some key suttas which discuss rebirth include &quot;Mahakammavibhanga Sutta&quot; (Majjhima Nikaya &quot;MN&quot; 136); &quot;Upali Sutta&quot; (MN 56); &quot;Kukkuravatika Sutta&quot; (MN 57); &quot;Moliyasivaka Sutta&quot; (Samyutta Nikaya &quot;SN&quot; 36.21); and &quot;Sankha Sutta&quot; (SN 42.8).

There are various terms which refer to the rebirth process, such as &quot;Āgati-gati&quot;, &quot;Punarbhava&quot; and others. The term &quot;Āgati&quot; literally means &#x27;coming back, return&#x27;, while &quot;Gati&quot; means &#x27;going away&#x27; and &quot;Punarbhava&quot; means &#x27;re-becoming&#x27;. Numerous other terms for rebirths are found in the Buddhist scriptures, such as &quot;Punagamana&quot;, &quot;Punavasa&quot;, &quot;Punanivattati&quot;, &quot;Abhinibbatti&quot;, and words with roots of &quot;*jati&quot; and &quot;*rupa&quot;.

According to Damien Keown, the EBTs state that on the night of his awakening, the Buddha attained the ability to recall a vast number of past lives along with numerous details about them. These early scriptures also state that he could remember &quot;as far as ninety one eons&quot; (&quot;Majjhima Nikaya&quot; i.483). An interpretation of these memories is a link to deceased ancestors and their individual lives and memories, with later views interpreting these as personal memories of past lives.

Bhikkhu Sujato notes that there are three main principles of rebirth in early Buddhism:

# Rebirth is regarded as an ongoing process to be escaped from in the search for liberation.
# Rebirth is determined by one&#x27;s own mind, particularly one&#x27;s ethical choices.
# The practice of Buddhism aims at ending rebirth.

According to Bhikkhu Anālayo, the Buddhist teaching of Dependent Origination is closely connected with the doctrine of rebirth. One of the 12 elements of Dependent Origination is &quot;birth&quot; (&quot;jati&quot;), which according to Anālayo refers to the rebirth of living beings. He cites SN 12.2 and its parallel in Samyukta Agama &quot;SA&quot; 298 as evidence. SN 12.2 defines &quot;birth&quot; in the context of Dependent Origination as &quot;the birth of the various beings into the various orders of beings, their being born, descent into the womb, production, the manifestation of the aggregates, the obtaining of the sense bases.&quot;

The early Buddhist conception of rebirth is one in which consciousness is always dependent on other factors, mainly name and form (&quot;nama-rupa&quot;) which refers to the physical body and various cognitive elements (such as feeling, perception and volition). Because of this, consciousness (&quot;viññana&quot;) is seen as supported by the body and its cognitive apparatus and cannot exist without it (and vice versa). However, consciousness can jump from one body to another (this is compared to how a spark from a hot iron can travel through the air in AN 7.52). This process applies to the very moment of conception, which requires a consciousness to enter the womb. This is indicated by Dirgha Agama &quot;DA&quot; 13 and its parallels (DN 15, Madhyama Agama &quot;MA&quot; 97). DA 13 states: [The Buddha said]: Ananda, in dependence on consciousness there is name and form. What is the meaning of this? If consciousness did not enter the mother&#x27;s womb, would there be name and form? [Ananda] replied: No.The same sutra states that if consciousness were to depart from the womb, the fetus could not continue to grow. Drawing on these sutras and others (such as SN 22.8 and SA 1265) Anālayo concludes that &quot;consciousness appears to be what provides the transition from one body to another&quot;. However, according to Sujato, the EBTs indicate that it is not just consciousness which undergoes rebirth, but some form of all the five aggregates.

The EBTs also seem to indicate that there is an in-between state (&quot;antarābhava&quot;) between death and rebirth. According to Bhikkhu Sujato, the most explicit passage supporting this can be found in the &quot;Kutuhalasāla Sutta&quot;, which states that &quot;when a being has laid down this body, but has not yet been reborn in another body, it is fuelled by craving.&quot;

Another term which is used to describe what gets reborn in the EBTs is &quot;gandhabba&quot; (&quot;spirit&quot;). According to the &quot;Assalayana Sutta&quot; (and its parallel at MA 151), for conception to be successful, a &quot;gandhabba&quot; must be present (as well as other physiological factors).

According to the EBTs, this rebirth consciousness is not a tabula rasa (blank slate), but contains certain underlying tendencies (&quot;anusaya&quot;) which in turn &quot;form an object for the establishment of consciousness&quot; (SA 359, SN 13.39). These subliminal inclinations are thus a condition for continued rebirth and also carry imprints from past lives.

According to the EBTs, past life memories can be retrieved through the cultivation of deep meditative states (&quot;samadhi&quot;). The Buddha himself is depicted as having developed the ability to recollect his past lives as well as to access the past life memories of other conscious beings in texts like the &quot;Bhayabherava Sutta&quot; (MN 4, the parallel Agama text is at Ekottara Agama 31.1) and the &quot;Mahapadana Sutta&quot; (DN 14, parallel at DA 1). Another key point affirmed by the EBTs is that the series of past lives stretches so far back into the past that a beginning point cannot be found (see e.g. SN 15.3 and SA 938).

=== Cosmology and liberation ===
In traditional Buddhist cosmology the rebirth, also called reincarnation or metempsychosis, can be in any of the six realms of existence. These are called the &quot;Gati&quot; in cycles of re-becoming, &quot;Bhavachakra&quot;. The six realms of rebirth include three good realms: Deva (heavenly, god), Asura (demigod), and Manusya (human); and three evil realms: Tiryak (animals), Preta (ghosts), and Naraka (hellish). The realm of rebirth is conditioned by the &quot;karma&quot; (deeds, intent) of current and previous lives; good karma will yield a happier rebirth into good realms while bad karma is believed to produce rebirth which is more unhappy and evil.

The release from this endless cycle of rebirth is called &quot;nirvana&quot; (Sanskrit: निर्वाण, &#x27;; Pali: &#x27;) in Buddhism. The achievement of &quot;nirvana&quot; is the ultimate goal of Buddhist teaching. However, much of traditional Buddhist practice has been centered on gaining merit and merit transfer, whereby an individual gains rebirth for oneself or one&#x27;s family members in the good realms, and avoids rebirth in the evil realms.

An important part of the early Buddhist soteriology is the four stages of awakening. With each stage, it was believed that one abandons certain mental defilements or &quot;fetters&quot;. Furthermore, each stage of awakening was believed to be associated with being closer to the ending of rebirth in the following manner:

* The Sotāpanna (Stream-enterer) – Still has up to seven rebirths left
* Sakadāgāmi (Once Returner) – Will only return for one more human rebirth
* Anāgāmi – Will only return once more to a heavenly realm
* Arahant – Has cut off rebirth completely, will not be reborn

=== Right View and Rebirth ===
According to the early Buddhist texts, accepting the truth of rebirth (glossed as the view that &quot;there is this world &amp; the next world&quot; in suttas like MN 117) is part of right view, the first element of the noble eight-fold path. While some scholars like Tilmann Vetter and Akira Hirakawa have questioned whether the Buddha saw rebirth as important, Johannes Bronkhorst argues that these views are based on scant evidence from the EBTs. He further writes that &quot;in so far as the texts allow us to reach an answer...the Buddha did believe in rebirth.&quot;

As noted by Anālayo, a standard definition of wrong view in the EBTs &quot;explicitly covers the denial of rebirth and the fruition of karma&quot;. The denial of rebirth is rejected as an &quot;annihilationist&quot; view in the &quot;Brahmajala Sutta&quot; (DN 1, Chinese parallel at DA 21, a Tibetan parallel also exists). The &quot;Samaññaphala Sutta&quot; (parallel at DA 27) also critiques the view of a school of ancient Indian materialism called Carvaka (which rejected rebirth and held that &quot;all are destroyed at death&quot;). According to this Sutta, to hold this view while living in a time when the Buddha&#x27;s teachings are available is equivalent to being born dumb and dull.

However, Anālayo argues that since there are different definitions of right view in the early texts, this &quot;leaves open the possibility that someone may engage in practices related to the Buddhist path to liberation without necessarily pledging faith in rebirth. It does not leave open the possibility of denying rebirth outright, however, since that would amount to holding wrong view&quot;. Because of this, Anālayo writes that the question of rebirth may simply be set aside without going as far as to deny rebirth and affirm annihilation.

An advice given in various EBTs is not to waste time speculating about what one might have been in the past and what they will be in the future. Such advice can be found in the &quot;Sabbasava Sutta&quot; (MN 2, with a parallel at MA 10). In contrast to this, various early texts regularly recommend the direct recollection of one&#x27;s own past lives as one of the three higher knowledges which correspond to the realizations attained by the Buddha on the night of his awakening. According to Anālayo, there is a major difference between direct access to our past lives through mental training (which is encouraged) and theoretical speculation (which is not).

Some early discourses also depict various Buddhist monks who seriously misunderstood the nature of rebirth. In one discourse, the &quot;Mahatanhasankhaya sutta&quot; (MN 38, MA 201), a monk comes to the conclusion that it is this very same consciousness that will be reborn (as opposed to a dependently originated process). In another discourse, the &quot;Mahapunnama sutta&quot; (MN 109, SA 58), a monk misapplies the doctrine of not-self to argue that there is nobody who will be affected by the fruition of karma.

== Later Developments and Theories ==

While the vast majority of Buddhists accept some notion of rebirth, they differ in their theories about the rebirth mechanism and precisely how events unfold after the moment of death. Already at the time of the Buddha there was much speculation about how to explain how rebirth occurs and how it relates to the doctrines of not-self and impermanence.

After the death of the Buddha, the various Buddhist schools which arose debated numerous aspects of rebirth, seeking to provide a more systematic explanation of the rebirth process. Important topics included the existence of the intermediate state, the exact nature of what undergoes rebirth, the relationship between rebirth and not-self, and how karma affects rebirth.

Both the Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika and the Theravāda tradition interpreted the teaching of the 12 factors (&quot;nidana&quot;) of dependent origination by using a three life model (the previous life, the present life and the future life). However, their Abhidharma works also state that the 12 factors of dependent origination can be understood as active in the present moment.

=== Karma and What Is Reborn ===
An important question which was debated by Indian Buddhist thinkers was the question of what exactly gets reborn, and how this is different from the Indian concept of an &quot;attā&quot; (ātman, unchanging self), which Buddhism rejects. The early Buddhist texts sometimes speak of an &quot;evolving consciousness&quot; (Pali: &quot;samvattanika viññana,&quot; M.1.256) or a &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; (Pali: &quot;viññana sotam&quot;, D.3.105) as that which transmigrates. However, according to Bruce Matthews, &quot;there is no single major systematic exposition on this subject&quot; in the Pali Canon.

Some Buddhist scholars such as Buddhaghosa, held that the lack of an unchanging self (&quot;atman&quot;) does not mean that there is a lack of continuity in rebirth, since there is still a causal link between lives. The process of rebirth across different realms of existence was compared to how a flame is transferred from one candle to another.

Various Indian Buddhist schools like the Sautrantika, Mahasamghika and the Mahasisaka held that the karmic link between lives could be explained by how karmic effects arose out of &quot;seeds&quot; which were deposited in a mental substratum. The Sautrantika Elder Srilata defended the theory of a &quot;subsidiary element&quot; (&quot;anudhatu&quot; or *&quot;purvanudhatu&quot;) which corresponds to the seed theory. The Sautrantika school held this was a &quot;transmigrating substratum of consciousness&quot;. It argued that each personal action &quot;perfumes&quot; the individual stream of consciousness and leads to the planting of a seed that would later germinate as a good or bad karmic result. This allowed them to explain what underwent the process of rebirth.

The Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika school on the other hand did not make use of the seed theory, since they held an eternalist theory of time, which held that phenomena (dharmas) in the past, present and future exist. Because of this, they argued that after an action was done by a person, it still continued to exist, and to be in a state of &quot;possession&quot; (&quot;prāpti&quot;) vis a vis the mindstream (&quot;santana&quot;) of the person who performed the action. According to Vaibhāṣikas, it was this which guaranteed the capacity of past karma to produce an effect long after it had been performed.

The seed theory was defended by the influential Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu in his &quot;Abhidharmakosha&quot;. It is also present in the &quot;Viniscayasamgrahani&quot; of the &quot;Yogacarabhumi&quot;. The Sarvastivada Abhidharma master Saṃghabhadra states that the seed theory was referred to by different names including: subsidiary elements (&quot;anudhatu&quot;), impressions (&quot;vasana&quot;); capability (&quot;samarthya&quot;), non-disappearance (&quot;avipranasa&quot;), or accumulation (&quot;upacaya&quot;).

The seed theory was adopted and further developed by the Yogacara school into their doctrine of the &quot;container consciousness&quot; (&quot;alaya-vijñana&quot;), which is a subliminal and constantly changing stream of consciousness that stores the seeds and undergoes rebirth. Asanga&#x27;s &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot; equated the alaya-vijñana with similar teachings found in other Buddhist schools which indicates that the idea of a rebirth consciousness was widespread. He states that this is the same idea which is called &quot;root-consciousness&quot; (&quot;mula-vijñana&quot;) by the Mahasamghika schools and what the Sthavira schools call the &quot;bhavaṅga&quot;.

According to Lobsang Dargyay, the Prāsaṇgika branch of the Madhyamaka school (which is exemplified by the philosopher Chandrakirti), attempted to refute every concept for a support or a storehouse of karmic information (including the alaya-vijñana). Instead, some Prāsaṇgika philosophers argue that a karmic action results in a potential which will ripen later. This potential is not a thing and does not need a support. However, other Madhyamaka thinkers (which are classified as &quot;Svatantrikas&quot; by Tibetans scholars), generally adopted the Sautrantika concept of tendencies stored in the stream of consciousness.

The Theravāda school&#x27;s doctrine of the bhavaṅga (Pali, &quot;ground of becoming&quot;, &quot;condition for existence&quot;) is another theory that was used to explain rebirth. It is seen as a mental process which conditions the next mental process at the moment of death and rebirth (though it does not actually travel in between lives, see below).

The Pudgalavada school of early Buddhism accepted the core premise of Buddhism that there is no ātman, but asserted that there is a &quot;personal entity&quot; (&quot;pudgala&quot;, &quot;puggala&quot;) that retains karmic merit and undergoes rebirth. This personal entity was held to be neither different nor identical to the five aggregates (&quot;skandhas&quot;). This concept was attacked by Theravada Buddhists in the early 1st millennium CE. The personal entity concept was rejected by the mid-1st millennium CE Pali scholar Buddhaghosa, who attempted to explain rebirth mechanism with &quot;rebirth-linking consciousness&quot; (&quot;patisandhi&quot;-&quot;citta&quot;). It was also criticized by northern Buddhist philosophers like Vasubandhu.

=== Intermediate Existence ===
Another topic which gave rise to much debate among Indian Buddhists was the idea of the intermediate existence (&quot;antarabhāva&quot;). According to Andre Bareau, the Indian Buddhist schools were split on this issue. While the Sarvāstivāda, Sautrantika, Pudgalavada, Pūrvaśaila and late Mahīśāsaka accepted this doctrine, the Mahāsāṃghika, early Mahīśāsaka, Theravāda, Vibhajyavāda and the &quot;Śāriputrābhidharma&quot; (possibly Dharmaguptaka) rejected it in favor of an immediate leap of the consciousness from one body to the next.

In the &quot;Abhidharmakosha&quot;, Vasubandhu defends the theory of the intermediate existence. He argues that each intermediate being is made up of the five aggregates, that it arises in the place of death and carries the &quot;configuration of the future being.&quot; Furthermore, according to Vasubandhu, this conscious intermediate being becomes aroused on seeing their future parents joined in intercourse and it becomes envious of one of the parents. Because of this desire and hatred, it becomes attached to the womb where it conditions the first moment of &quot;birth existence&quot; (&quot;pratisamdhi&quot;).

In Tibetan Buddhism, the intermediate existence (Tibetan: &quot;bardo&quot;) concept developed elaborate descriptions of numerous visions experienced during the process of dying, including visions of peaceful and wrathful deities. These ideas led to various maps for navigating the intermediate existence which are discussed in texts like the &quot;Bardo Thodol&quot;.

In contrast to this, the Theravāda scholar Buddhaghosa argued that rebirth occurs in one instant as part of a process called &quot;rebirth-linking&quot; (&quot;patisandhi&quot;). According to Buddhaghosa, at death, the sense faculties dissolve one by one until only consciousness is left. The very last moment of consciousness at death (&quot;cuti viññana&quot;) conditions the very first instant of consciousness of the next life, the &quot;patisandhi viññana&quot;, which occurs at the time of conception. The relationship is compared to that between a seal and wax. While they are not the same entity, the wax impression is conditioned by the seal. Therefore, in the classic Theravāda view, nothing actually transmigrates.

In spite of the rejection of the intermediate state by such an influential figure, some modern Theravāda scholars (such as Balangoda Ananda Maitreya) have defended the idea of an intermediate state. It is also a very common belief among monks and laypersons in the Theravāda world (where it is commonly referred to as the &quot;gandhabba&quot; or &quot;antarabhāva&quot;).

== Buddhist Arguments for Rebirth ==
=== Empirical Arguments ===
Ancient Buddhists as well as some moderns cite the reports of the Buddha and his disciples of having gained direct knowledge into their own past lives as well as those of other beings through a kind of parapsychological ability or extrasensory perception (termed &quot;abhiñña&quot;). Traditional Buddhist philosophers like Dharmakīrti have defended the concept of special yogic perception (&quot;yogi-pratyakṣa&quot;) which is able to empirically verify the truth of rebirth. Some modern Buddhists authors like K.N. Jayatilleke also argue that the Buddha&#x27;s main argument in favor of rebirth was based on empirical grounds, and that this included the idea that extra-sensory perception (Pali: &quot;atikkanta-manusaka&quot;) can provide a validation for rebirth.

Modern Buddhists such as Bhikkhu Anālayo and Jayatilleke have also argued that rebirth may be empirically verifiable and have pointed to certain parapsychological phenomena as possible evidence, mainly near-death experiences (NDEs), past-life regression, reincarnation research and xenoglossy. Both Anālayo and B. Alan Wallace point to the work of the American Psychiatrist Ian Stevenson as providing possible evidence of rebirth. This is not just a recent phenomenon. According to Anālayo, ancient Chinese Buddhists also pointed to anomalous phenomena such as NDEs to argue for the truth of rebirth. Furthermore, according to Roger R. Jackson, the Indian Buddhist philosopher Śāntarakṣita (725–788) argues in his &quot;Tattvasaṅgraha&quot; that newborn children exhibit a wide range of complex desires, emotions and mental states that could not exist without the force of past habit, and thus they must be based on the habits acquired in a past life.

Wallace also notes that several modern Buddhist figures, such as Pa Auk Sayadaw and Geshe Gedun Lodro have also written about how to train the mind to access past life memories. The Burmese monk Pa Auk Sayadaw is known for teaching such methods and some of his western students like Shaila Catherine have written about this and their experiences in practicing it.

B. Alan Wallace argues that first person introspection is a valid means of knowledge about the mind (when that introspection is well trained by meditation) and has been used by numerous contemplatives throughout history. He writes that a well trained mind, &quot;which may be likened to an inwardly focused telescope,&quot; should be able to access &quot;a subtle, individual mind stream that carries on from one lifetime to another.&quot; Wallace proposes that a research project using well trained meditators could access information from past lives in an accurate manner and these could then be checked by independent third person observers.

=== Metaphysical arguments ===

Besides defending the status of the Buddha as an epistemically authoritative or reliable person (&quot;pramāṇa puruṣa&quot;), Indian Buddhist philosophers like Dignaga (c. 480–540 CE) and Dharmakīrti (fl. c. 6th or 7th century), as well as later commentators on their works, also put forth philosophical arguments in favor of rebirth and especially directed against the reductionist materialist philosophy of the Carvaka school.

In his &quot;Pramanavarttika&quot;, Dharmakīrti defends rebirth by initially focusing on refuting the materialist doctrine of the Carvaka school, which held that the support (&quot;asraya&quot;) for cognition is the body and that when the body is destroyed, cognition is destroyed. Modern Buddhists who argue in favor of rebirth like B. Alan Wallace often begin by mounting similar arguments against materialism and physicalism, pointing to the current philosophical debate on the &quot;hard problem of consciousness&quot; and arguing that conscious properties cannot be reduced to physical properties. Indeed, according to Wallace &quot;the metaphysical views of materialism are in fundamental conflict with the Buddhist worldview regarding the nature of the mind&quot;

According to Richard P. Hayes, Dharmakīrti denied that mental events were a mere byproduct of the body, instead holding that &quot;both mental events and physical events can be seen as effects of the same set of causal conditions.&quot; For Dharmakīrti, all events are dependent on multiple causes, and they must be preceded by an &quot;antecedent causal condition&quot; of the same class. This means that all mental events &quot;must have&quot; a previous mental event as part of its causal nexus (presumably stretching back before one&#x27;s birth). According to Hayes, Dharmakīrti holds therefore that &quot;both physical factors and nonphysical factors play a role in the formation of mental events&quot;, if not there would be no difference between sentient beings and inanimate matter.

Philosopher Evan Thompson outlines Dharmakīrti&#x27;s main point as follows: &quot;matter and consciousness have totally different natures; an effect must be of the same nature as its cause; hence consciousness cannot arise from or be produced by matter (though material things can condition or influence consciousness).&quot; Thompson further notes that for Dharmakīrti, the nature of matter is that it is obstructive, it resists other instances of matter, while the nature of consciousness is altogether different since it is capable of including diverse objects within itself at the same time without any of them obstructing the other. Furthermore, phenomenal consciousness is able to illuminate or cognize objects (as well as itself, i.e. it is self-reflexive) and has intentionality, while matter does not.

Eli Franco mentions that for Dharmakīrti, the position that cognition &quot;can arise from the body alone, independent of their similar causes&quot; at the moment of birth is irrational. That is, if the mind is not being conditioned by a previous cognitive event, then it cannot arise from inert matter. Dharmakīrti also argues that mental events can causally condition physical events, and thus there is no reason to privilege matter as being primary. According to Martin Willson, this kind of argument is the most commonly used in the Tibetan philosophical tradition to establish the truth of rebirth and in its most simple form can be put as follows:With respect to the knowing (consciousness or mind) of an ordinary being just born: it is preceded by earlier knowing; because it is knowing.Willson notes that this relies on two further assumptions, the first is that any mental continuum must have previous causes, the second is that materialism is false and that mind cannot emerge solely from matter (emergentism).

According to Jacob Andrew Lucas, the strength of Dharmakīrti&#x27;s argument lies on its two key premises:
# Consciousness, or the mental continuum, has characteristics that are distinct from physical characteristics.
# The substantial cause for any event is a prior event with the same character (i.e. it is a homogeneous cause).
However, as Lucas notes, we should not take Dharmakīrti to be arguing in favor of a strict mind-body dualism, since in all systems of Buddhist thought, the mind and body are deeply interconnected and dependent on each other. Dharmakīrti &#x27;s point is merely that consciousness cannot arise from physical factors alone, which does not entail that consciousness is totally separate from physical factors.

Jacob Andrew Lucas provides a modern formulation of an argument for rebirth which draws on the work of Galen Strawson. Strawson argues against emergence as well as against proto-experiential qualities and argues for a form of constitutive panpsychism. Lucas rejects constitutive panpsychism as a live option for a Buddhist due to various issues including the &quot;combination problem&quot; and because it supports the idea that the conscious subject collapses into micro-experiences when the body dies. Lucas then proceeds to argue for an unbroken stream of consciousness or an indivisible cluster of conscious experience &quot;that can neither arise from nor collapse into rudimentary factors that are devoid of the distinctive characteristics of consciousness.&quot;

Theravada Abhidhamma makes a similar argument to Dharmakīrti&#x27;s. According to the Abhidhamma teacher Nina van Gorkom, physical and mental events (&quot;dhammas&quot;) both depend on each other and on previous events of the same category (i.e. mental events must also be conditioned by previous mental events, and so on). In Abhidhamma, the mental event (&quot;citta&quot;) which arises at the first moment of life is called the rebirth consciousness or &quot;patisandhi-citta.&quot; According to van Gorkom, &quot;there isn&#x27;t any citta which arises without conditions, the &quot;patisandhi-citta&quot; must also have conditions. The &quot;patisandhi-citta&quot; is the first &quot;citta&quot; of a new life and thus its cause can only be in the past.&quot;

=== Pragmatic arguments and wager theories ===
Various Buddhists and interpreters of the Buddhist texts such as David Kalupahana and Etienne Lamotte, have argued that the Buddha is a kind of pragmatist regarding truth, and that he saw truths as important only when they were soteriologically useful. Thus, the Buddhist position on rebirth could be defended on pragmatic grounds instead of empirical or logical grounds. Some modern Buddhists have taken this position.

The American monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu has argued for the acceptance of the Buddhist idea of rebirth as a type of pragmatic wager argument (Pali: &quot;apaṇṇaka&quot;, &quot;safe bet&quot; or &quot;guarantee&quot;). Thanissaro argues that &quot;the Buddha stated that it&#x27;s a safe wager to assume that actions bear results that can affect not only this lifetime but also lifetimes after this than it is to assume the opposite.&quot; Thanissaro cites Majjhima Nikaya 60 (&quot;Apaṇṇaka sutta&quot;) where the Buddha says that if there is an afterlife, those who perform bad actions have &quot;made a bad throw twice&quot; (because they are harmed in this world and in the next) while those who perform good actions will not, and thus he calls his teaching a &quot;safe-bet teaching&quot;. This ancient wager argument is similar in structure to modern wager arguments like Pascal&#x27;s Wager and the Atheist&#x27;s Wager.

According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu:The Buddha&#x27;s main pragmatic argument is that if one accepted his teachings, one would be likely to pay careful attention to one&#x27;s actions, so as to do no harm. This in and of itself is a worthy activity regardless of whether the rest of the path was true. When applying this argument to the issue of rebirth and karmic results, the Buddha sometimes coupled it with a second pragmatic argument that resembles Pascal&#x27;s wager: If one practices the Dhamma, one leads a blameless life in the here-and-now. Even if the afterlife and karmic results do not exist, one has not lost the wager, for the blamelessness of one&#x27;s life is a reward in and of itself. If there is an afterlife with karmic results, then one has won a double reward: the blamelessness of one&#x27;s life here and now, and the good rewards of one&#x27;s actions in the afterlife. These two pragmatic arguments form the central message of this sutta.Sri Lankan Buddhist philosopher K.N. Jayatilleke writes that the Buddha&#x27;s &quot;wager argument&quot; in MN 60 is that a rational person (&quot;viññu puriso&quot;) would reason as follows:

The &quot;Kālāma Sutta&quot; also contains a similar wager argument towards rebirth, called the &quot;four assurances&quot; or &quot;four consolations&quot;. These four assurances are as follows:

# &quot;If there is another world, and if there is the fruit and result of good and bad deeds, it is possible that with the breakup of the body, after death, I will be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.&quot;
# &quot;If there is no other world, and there is no fruit and result of good and bad deeds, still right here, in this very life, I maintain myself in happiness, without enmity and ill will, free of trouble.&quot;
# &quot;Suppose evil comes to one who does evil. Then, when I have no evil intentions toward anyone, how can suffering afflict me, since I do no evil deed?&quot;
# &quot;Suppose evil does not come to one who does evil. Then right here I see myself purified in both respects.&quot;

=== Moral arguments ===
According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, part of the reason the Buddha recommended having conviction in the truth of rebirth was that his teaching on the nature of human action would be incomplete without reference to rebirth. Thanissaro argues that the distinction that the Buddha draws between skillful and unskillful actions is based on the consequences of these actions, and that this provides a strong motivation to do good as long as rebirth holds. This is because actions can sometimes take many lifetimes to yield their results (and thus bad persons do not always experience bad consequences in one lifetime as can be seen in SN 42.13 and MN 136) and therefore only a multi-life perspective can lead to &quot;a complete and convincing case that unskillful actions should always be avoided, and skillful ones always developed.&quot;

Thanissaro further writes that:If you assume that your actions have results, and those results will reverberate through many lifetimes, it&#x27;s easier to stick to your principles not to lie, kill, or steal even under severe duress. And even though you may not &quot;know&quot; whether these assumptions are true, you cannot plan an action without implicitly wagering on the issue. This is why simply stating, &quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; is not an adequate response to the questions of rebirth and the efficacy of karma. The attitude behind it may be honest on one level, but it&#x27;s dishonest in thinking that this is all that needs to be said, for it ignores the fact that you have to make assumptions about the possible results of your actions every time you act.B. Alan Wallace writes that nihilistic and materialistic views which reject rebirth &quot;undermine any sense of moral responsibility, and this is bound to have a profoundly detrimental effect on societies that adopt such beliefs.&quot; He further argues:If we embrace a materialistic worldview, we will naturally seek satisfaction and fulfillment by turning our attention to the outside world, looking for novel sensory and intellectual experiences as well as new material acquisitions. Likewise, when we focus on decreasing our level of suffering and pain, once again our orientation will be outward, looking for scientific and technological breakthroughs to relieve our suffering. Human desire for ever-greater happiness seems to be insatiable, and a materialistic worldview strongly supports materialistic values and a way of life centered on the never-ending quest of consumerism... A materialistic outlook that focuses our attention on the bounties of the external physical world simultaneously blinds us to the inner resources of the human heart and mind. If all our efforts go toward the alleviation of suffering and realization of happiness by external means, the inner ways that we might pursue the good life will be unexplored. A materialistic worldview provides no rationale for making a commitment to ethics or spiritual practice of any kind. Material values and consumerism are naturally aligned with materialism, which reduces meditation to a means for making a materialistic way of life more bearable.According to Alexander Berzin, acceptance of rebirth also has positive moral consequences, particularly in our practice of the Buddhist path. Berzin writes that an understanding of rebirth allows one to better cultivate compassion and loving-kindness towards all beings, since it allows us to see how in past lives, we have been related to all beings and how they have been our mothers (and vice versa). Likewise, we have also been many different types of beings in the past (male, female, animals, numerous nationalities etc). According to Berzin, this reflection allows us to better relate to other sentient beings.

==Modern naturalistic interpretations==
In the 1940s, J. G. Jennings interpreted the teaching of rebirth in a less than literal sense. Believing that the doctrine of anatta (not-self) is incompatible with the view that the actions of one individual can have repercussions for the &quot;same&quot; individual in a future life, Jennings argued that the doctrine of actual transmigration was an &quot;Indian dogma&quot; that was not part of the original teachings of the Buddha. However, rebirth could instead be understood as the recurrence of our selfish desires which could repeat themselves &quot;in endless succeeding generations&quot;. In this interpretation, our actions do have consequences beyond our present lives, but these are &quot;collective not individual.&quot;

The British Buddhist thinker Stephen Batchelor has recently posited a similar view on the topic:Regardless of what we believe, our actions will reverberate beyond our deaths. Irrespective of our personal survival, the legacy of our thoughts, words, and deeds will continue through the impressions we leave behind in the lives of those we have influenced or touched in any way.The Thai modernist Buddhist monk Buddhadāsa (1906–1993) also had a rationalistic or psychological interpretation of rebirth. He argued that since there is no substantial entity or soul (&quot;atman&quot;),  &quot;there is no one born, there is no one who dies and is reborn. Therefore, the whole question of rebirth is quite foolish and has nothing to do with Buddhism…in the sphere of the Buddhist teachings there is no question of rebirth or reincarnation.&quot; However, Buddhadāsa did not completely reject the rebirth doctrine, he only saw the idea that there is something that gets reborn into a future womb as &quot;trivial&quot;. Instead of this &#x27;literal&#x27; view, he interpreted the true meaning of rebirth as the re-arising of the sense of self or &quot;I&quot; or &quot;me&quot;, a kind of &quot;self-centredness&quot; which is &quot;a mental event arising out of ignorance, craving, and clinging.&quot; According to Buddhadāsa, this is what &quot;rebirth&quot; truly means on the ultimate level (&quot;paramattha&quot;) of discourse.

== Comparison with rebirth doctrines in Hinduism and Jainism ==
The rebirth theories in different traditions within Hinduism rely on their foundational assumption that soul exists (Atman, attā), in contrast to Buddhist assumption that there is no soul. Hindu traditions consider soul to be the unchanging eternal essence of a living being, and in many of its theistic and non-theistic traditions the soul asserted to be identical with Brahman, the ultimate reality. Thus while both Buddhism and Hinduism accept the karma and rebirth doctrine, and both focus on ethics in this life as well as liberation from rebirth and suffering as the ultimate spiritual pursuit, they have a very different view on whether a self or soul exists, which impacts the details of their respective rebirth theories.

Rebirth and karma doctrine in Jainism differ from those in Buddhism, even though both are non-theistic Sramana traditions. Jainism, in contrast to Buddhism, accepts the foundational assumption that soul exists (&quot;Jiva&quot;) and is involved in the rebirth mechanism. Further, Jainism considers that the rebirth has a start, that rebirth and redeath cycle is a part of a progression of a soul, karmic dust particles emanate from ethical or unethical intent and actions, these karmic particles stick to the soul which determines the next birth. Jainism, further asserts that some souls can never achieve liberation, that ethical living such as Ahimsa (non-violence) and asceticism are means to liberation for those who can attain liberation, and that liberated souls reach the eternal &quot;siddha&quot; (enlightened state) that ends their rebirth cycles. Jainism, like Buddhism, also believes in realms of birth and is symbolized by its emblematic Swastika sign, with ethical and moral theories of its lay practices focussing on obtaining good rebirth.

==Life and career==
Thorn was born in Luxembourg City. His early childhood, however, was spent in Strasbourg where his father worked for the French railways. At the outbreak of World War II the family returned to Luxembourg. While still at school he engaged in resistance activities during the German occupation, and spent several months in prison. After the war he initially studied medicine in Montpellier, then switched to law, and continued his studies in Lausanne and Paris, and practised law in Luxembourg from 1955. In 1957 he married Liliane Petit, a journalist. He entered politics in 1959, representing the liberal Democratic Party. He was a member of the European Parliament from 1959 to 1969. He was Chairman of the Democratic Party from 1962 to 1969. From 1961 to 1963 he was one of the aldermen of the City of Luxembourg.

Thorn was Foreign Minister and Foreign Trade Minister of Luxembourg from 1969 to 1980, Prime Minister from 1974 to 1979 and Minister of Economics from 1977 to 1980. He was also President of the United Nations General Assembly from 1975 to 1976 for its 30th session.

As Prime Minister from 1974 to 1979 he presided over a socialist-liberal coalition, between his own Democratic Party and the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. This was the first Luxembourg government since World War II that did not involve the dominant Christian Social People&#x27;s Party (CSV), and similarly, he was the first non-CSV prime minister since the war. He was the head of government even though his party had fewer seats in the legislature than its coalition partner.

== European Commission ==
In 1980 Thorn was chosen as president of the commission of the European Communities (now called the European Union), in succession to Roy Jenkins. He took office on 12 January 1981. France and Britain had been against his appointment as commission president, whereas his candidature was supported by the smaller countries and by West Germany, this because of Luxembourg&#x27;s involvement in building up the commission.

His presidency was marked by several difficulties. It coincided with a time of economic and political crisis, of Eurosclerosis, inside the European Community. Relations between the commission and British government under Margaret Thatcher declined, over her demands that Britain should be compensated by other countries for its share of payments towards the commission budget. There was also tension due to other EC governments&#x27; reservations about Britain&#x27;s role in the Falklands War; and due to some European leaders&#x27; opposition to United States foreign policy and the deployment of cruise missiles and Pershing missiles in Europe. This was in addition to the long-running international recession, and occasional threats of trade wars. This all &quot;combined to put the aspirations of Thorn and other supporters of European integration on hold&quot;. However, as EC President, Thorn did manage to reach agreement on a common fisheries policy, and laid the basis for Portugal and Spain joining the European Community. Greece had just joined when his mandate started in 1981.

Although Thorn was not considered a very forceful commission president, during his term of office the commission continued to expand its power, both at the expense of the national governments of EC members, and of the European Parliament, with which it engaged in a constant power struggle. In this, Thorn laid the groundwork for his successor Jacques Delors, who took the commission to the height of its power.

== Post-Presidency ==
After leaving the commission presidency in 1985, Thorn went into business. He was chairman of Luxembourg&#x27;s largest media company CLT, and president of the Banque Internationale à Luxembourg from 1985 to 1999.

Thorn remained active in international and political affairs, as President of the International European Movement and as a member of the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg conference and of the Jean Monnet Committee. He was also president of the Liberal International. He was married to Liliane Thorn-Petit (1933–2008), a journalist, with whom he had one son.

<text>The Syrian pound or lira (; abbreviation: LS or SP in Latin, ل.س in Arabic, historically also [[Pound sign|£S]], and £Syr; ISO code: SYP) is the currency of Syria. It is issued by the Central Bank of Syria. The pound is nominally divided into 100 piastres ( &quot;qirsh,&quot; plural قروش &quot;qurūsh&quot; in Arabic, abbreviated to ), although piastre coins are no longer issued. 

Before 1947, the Arabic inscription of the word &quot;qirsh&quot; was spelled with the initial Arabic letter غ, after which the word began with ق. Until 1958, banknotes were issued with Arabic on the obverse and French on the reverse. Since 1958, English has been used on the reverses, hence the three different names for this currency. Coins used both Arabic and French until independence, then only Arabic.

== History ==
=== French mandate ===
During the period when Syria was a part of the Ottoman Empire, which lasted about 400 years, the Ottoman pound was its main currency. Following the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the placing of Syria under a mandate (French occupation), the Egyptian pound was used in the territories under French and British mandates, including Lebanon, Transjordan and Palestine. Upon taking Lebanon and Syria under its separate mandate, the French government sought to replace the Egyptian currency and granted a commercial bank, the Banque de Syrie (a French affiliate of the Ottoman Bank), the authority to issue a currency for territories under its new mandate.

The pound (or in French) was introduced in 1919 and was set at a value of 20 francs. As the political status of Lebanon evolved, the Banque de Syrie, which was to act as the official bank for Lebanon and Syria, was renamed the Banque de Syrie et du Grand-Liban (BSL). BSL issued the Syro-Lebanese pound for 15 years, starting in 1924. Two years before the expiration of the 15-year period, BSL split the Lebanese-Syrian currency into two separate currencies that could still be used interchangeably in either state. In 1939, the bank was renamed the Banque de Syrie et du Liban.

In 1941, the peg to the French franc was replaced by a peg to sterling of LS 8.83125 = £1, as a consequence of the occupation of Syria by British and Free French forces. This rate was based on the pre-war conversion rate between the franc and sterling. In 1946, following devaluation of the franc, the pound was pegged once again to the franc at a rate of LS 1 = 54.35 F. In 1947, Syria joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar at LS 2.19148 = US$1, a rate which was maintained until 1961.

===Independence===
The Lebanese and Syrian currencies split in 1948. From 1961, a series of official exchange rates were in operation, alongside a parallel, black market rate which reflected the true market rate for Syrian pounds in Jordan and Lebanon where there was a healthy trade in the Syrian currency. The market was allowed to flourish because everybody, including government and public sector companies, needed it. The black market rate diverged dramatically from the official rate in the 1980s. In July 2007, the currency was pegged to the IMF SDR (Special Drawing Rights).

=== Syrian Civil War ===
There was a capital flight to nearby countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Turkey, as a result of the Syrian Civil War that started in 2011. In addition, Syria has been subject to sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union and other countries, which shut Syria out of the global financial system. To circumvent the sanctions, Syrians effected foreign transactions through banks in neighbouring countries, especially Lebanon. As a result, the official exchange rate has deteriorated significantly, falling from LS 47 = US$1 in March 2011 to LS 515 = US$1 in July 2017 and 7500 = US$1 in April 2023 (after the Lebanese liquidity crisis)

On 31 October 2019, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad mentioned in an interview that liberating territories had complex economic consequences. While it removed foreign-funded support for terrorists, it also cut off dollar inflows that stabilize local economies:
Following the fall of the Assad regime at the end of 2024, Ahmed al-Sharaa, president of the Syrian transitional government, stated that he intends to replace the Syrian pound with a new currency once it re-stabilizes.

===Exchange rate===
On 5 December 2005, the selling rate quoted by the Commercial Bank of Syria was LS 48.4 = US$1. A rate of about LS 50 to US$1 was usual in the early 2000s, but the rate is subject to fluctuations. Since the start of the civil war in 2011, the pound&#x27;s unofficial exchange rate has deteriorated significantly. It was LS 47 = US$1 in March 2011 and LS 515 in July 2017. Since July 2007, the Syrian pound has been pegged to the IMF SDR (Special Drawing Rights).

On 29 November 2019, following the Lebanese protests, the black market rate was LS 765 = US$1, a decrease of 30% since the turmoil started in Lebanon a month earlier, as the protests led Lebanese banks to impose tight controls on hard currency withdrawals and transfers abroad, making it hard for Syrians to access funds held by them in those banks.

The black-market rate fell to LS 950 on 2 December 2019, another 25% decrease, while the official rate set by the central bank was LS 434 = US$1.

On 13 January 2020, the currency deteriorated further, as more than LS 1,000 was traded for US$1 in the black market, despite being valued at LS 434 = US$1 by the Syrian Central Bank. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Syria, the Syrian pound continued to fall against the U.S. dollar in the black market, where US$1 equaled more than LS 1,600 in May 2020. A month later, the Syrian pound passed LS 2,000 against the dollar, and a few days later, it passed LS 3,000 against the dollar.

Upon the implementation of the U.S. sanctions related to the Caesar Act, anti-government local authorities in Idlib Governorate adopted the Turkish lira in place of the plummeting Syrian pound. Turkish lira has also replaced Syrian pound in other Turkish occupied areas of northern Syria, such as Afrin and Jarablus.

On 31 December 2022, the Syrian pound hit a new record low again on the black market, where each US$1 cost LS 7,150, twice as much as a year before. In 2023, the exchange rate continued deterioration, reaching LS 15,000 per US$1.

During the 2024 Syrian opposition offensives, the exchange rate fell to a record low of LS 25,000 per US$1. After the fall of the Assad regime, the currency was traded between LS 12,500 and 10,000 per US$1.

==Coins==
In 1921, cupro-nickel piastre coins were introduced, followed in 1926 by aluminium bronze 2p and 5p. In 1929, holed, nickel-brass 1pt and silver 10p, 25p and 50p were introduced. Nickel-brass pt coins were introduced 1935, followed by zinc 1pt and aluminium-bronze pt in 1940. During the Second World War, brass 1pt and aluminium p emergency coins were issued. These pieces were crudely produced and undated.

A new coinage was introduced between 1947 and 1948 in denominations of p, 5p, 10p, 25p, 50p and LS 1, with the p, 5p and 10p struck in cupro-nickel and the others in silver. Aluminium-bronze replaced cupro-nickel in 1960, with nickel replacing silver in 1968. In 1996, following high inflation, new coins were introduced in denominations of LS 1, LS 2, LS 5, LS 10 and LS 25, with the LS 25 being bimetallic. In 2003, LS 5, LS 10, and LS 25 coins were issued, with latent images. On December 26, 2018, the Central Bank of Syria introduced a LS 50 coin for general circulation to replace the banknote of that denomination. Due to high inflation, only 50 pound coin is in circulation. All other coins are worthless by Dec 2022.

==Banknotes==

In 1919, the Banque de Syrie introduced notes for 5p, 25p and 50p, LS 1 and LS 5. These were followed, in 1920, by notes for LS 1, LS 10, LS 25, LS 50 and LS 100. In 1925, the Banque de Syrie et du Grand-Liban began issuing notes and production of denominations below 25p ceased. Notes below LS 1 were not issued from 1930. In 1939, the issuing body again changed its name, to the Banque de Syrie et du Liban.

Between 1942 and 1944, the government introduced notes for 5p, 10p, 25p and 50p. In the early 1950s, undated notes were issued by the Institut d&#x27;Emission de Syrie in denominations of LS 1, LS 5, LS 10, LS 25, LS 50 and LS 100, followed by notes dated 1955 for LS 10 and LS 25. The Banque Centrale de Syrie took over paper money issuance in 1957, issuing the same denominations as the Institut d&#x27;Emission.

In 1958, the French language was removed from banknotes and replaced by English. Notes were issued for LS 1, LS 5, LS 10, LS 25, LS 50, LS 100 and LS 500. In 1966, the design of the LS 25, LS 50, and LS 100 notes were changed. In 1976 and 1977, the designs changed for all the denominations except the LS 500 note.

In 1997 and 1998, a new series of notes was introduced in denominations of LS 50, LS 100, LS 200, LS 500 and LS 1,000, with the lower denominations replaced by coins. In 2009, the LS 50, LS 100, and LS 200 pound notes were changed with an entirely new design.
On 2 July 2014, a new LS 500 note was introduced, followed by a LS 1,000 note on 30 July 2015, a LS 2,000 note on 2 July 2017, and a LS 5,000 note on 24 January 2021.

===2009 series===
On 27 July 2010, the Central Bank of Syria issued a new series of banknotes dated 2009 in denominations of LS 50, LS 100, and LS 200. The notes were designed by Austrian banknote designer Robert Kalina.
The Central Bank of Syria issued new LS 500 and LS 1,000 notes in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The reverse of the new LS 1,000 note features an image of a Roman mosaic painting discovered in Deir al-Adas. President Bashar al-Assad was added to the LS 2,000 note in 2017. A LS 5,000 note was released in January 2021.

<text>The Kerr metric or Kerr geometry describes the geometry of empty spacetime around a rotating uncharged axially symmetric black hole with a quasispherical event horizon. The Kerr metric is an exact solution of the Einstein field equations of general relativity; these equations are highly non-linear, which makes exact solutions very difficult to find.

== Overview ==
The Kerr metric is a generalization to a rotating body of the Schwarzschild metric, discovered by Karl Schwarzschild in 1915, which described the geometry of spacetime around an uncharged, spherically symmetric, and non-rotating body. The corresponding solution for a &quot;charged&quot;, spherical, non-rotating body, the Reissner–Nordström metric, was discovered soon afterwards (1916–1918). However, the exact solution for an uncharged, &quot;rotating&quot; black hole, the Kerr metric, remained unsolved until 1963, when it was discovered by Roy Kerr. The natural extension to a charged, rotating black hole, the Kerr–Newman metric, was discovered shortly thereafter in 1965. These four related solutions may be summarized by the following table, where &quot;Q&quot; represents the body&#x27;s electric charge and &quot;J&quot; represents its spin angular momentum:

According to the Kerr metric, a rotating body should exhibit frame-dragging (also known as Lense–Thirring precession), a distinctive prediction of general relativity. The first measurement of this frame dragging effect was done in 2011 by the Gravity Probe B experiment. Roughly speaking, this effect predicts that objects coming close to a rotating mass will be entrained to participate in its rotation, not because of any applied force or torque that can be felt, but rather because of the swirling curvature of spacetime itself associated with rotating bodies. In the case of a rotating black hole, at close enough distances, all objects – even light – &quot;must&quot; rotate with the black hole; the region where this holds is called the ergosphere.

The light from distant sources can travel around the event horizon several times (if close enough); creating multiple images of the same object. To a distant viewer, the apparent perpendicular distance between images decreases at a factor of 2 (about 500). However, fast spinning black holes have less distance between multiplicity images.

Rotating black holes have surfaces where the metric seems to have apparent singularities; the size and shape of these surfaces depends on the black hole&#x27;s mass and angular momentum. The outer surface encloses the ergosphere and has a shape similar to a flattened sphere. The inner surface marks the event horizon; objects passing into the interior of this horizon can never again communicate with the world outside that horizon. However, neither surface is a true singularity, since their apparent singularity can be eliminated in a different coordinate system. A similar situation obtains when considering the Schwarzschild metric which also appears to result in a singularity at dividing the space above and below &quot;r&quot;s into two disconnected patches; using a different coordinate transformation one can then relate the extended external patch to the inner patch (see &quot;&quot;) – such a coordinate transformation eliminates the apparent singularity where the inner and outer surfaces meet. Objects between these two surfaces must co-rotate with the rotating black hole, as noted above; this feature can in principle be used to extract energy from a rotating black hole, up to its invariant mass energy, &quot;Mc&quot;2.

The LIGO experiment that first detected gravitational waves, announced in 2016, also provided the first direct observation of a pair of Kerr black holes.

== Metric ==
The Kerr metric is commonly expressed in one of two forms, the Boyer–Lindquist form and the Kerr–Schild form. It can be readily derived from the Schwarzschild metric, using the Newman–Janis algorithm by Newman–Penrose formalism (also known as the spin–coefficient formalism), Ernst equation, or Ellipsoid coordinate transformation.

=== Boyer–Lindquist coordinates ===

The Kerr metric describes the geometry of spacetime in the vicinity of a mass rotating with angular momentum . The metric (or equivalently its line element for proper time) in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates is

{\Sigma} \sin^{2}\theta \right) \sin^{2}\theta \ d\phi^{2} - \frac{2r_\text{s} ra \sin^{2} \theta}{\Sigma} c \, dt \, d\phi
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where the coordinates are standard oblate spheroidal coordinates, which are equivalent to the cartesian coordinates

where formula_1 is the Schwarzschild radius

and where for brevity, the length scales and have been introduced as


A key feature to note in the above metric is the cross-term . This implies that there is coupling between time and motion in the plane of rotation that disappears when the black hole&#x27;s angular momentum goes to zero.

In the non-relativistic limit where (or, equivalently, ) goes to zero, the Kerr metric becomes the orthogonal metric for the oblate spheroidal coordinates
 dr^{2} + \Sigma d\theta^{2} + \left(r^{2} + a^{2} \right) \sin^{2}\theta d\phi^{2} &lt;/math&gt;|}}

=== Kerr–Schild coordinates ===
The Kerr metric can be expressed in &quot;Kerr–Schild&quot; form, using a particular set of Cartesian coordinates as follows. These solutions were proposed by Kerr and Schild in 1965.

Notice that k is a unit 3-vector, making the 4-vector a null vector, with respect to both &quot;g&quot; and &quot;η&quot;. Here &quot;M&quot; is the constant mass of the spinning object, &quot;η&quot; is the Minkowski tensor, and &quot;a&quot; is a constant rotational parameter of the spinning object. It is understood that the vector is directed along the positive z-axis. The quantity &quot;r&quot; is not the radius, but rather is implicitly defined by
Notice that the quantity &quot;r&quot; becomes the usual radius &quot;R&quot;
: formula_2
when the rotational parameter approaches zero. In this form of solution, units are selected so that the speed of light is unity (). At large distances from the source (&quot;R&quot; ≫ &quot;a&quot;), these equations reduce to the Eddington–Finkelstein form of the Schwarzschild metric.

In the Kerr–Schild form of the Kerr metric, the determinant of the metric tensor is everywhere equal to negative one, even near the source.

=== Soliton coordinates ===
As the Kerr metric (along with the Kerr–NUT metric) is axially symmetric, it can be cast into a form to which the Belinski–Zakharov transform can be applied. This implies that the Kerr black hole has the form of a gravitational soliton.

== Mass of rotational energy ==
If the complete rotational energy of a black hole is extracted, for example with the Penrose process, the remaining mass cannot shrink below the irreducible mass. Therefore, if a black hole rotates with the spin , its total mass-equivalent is higher by a factor of in comparison with a corresponding Schwarzschild black hole where is equal to . The reason for this is that in order to get a static body to spin, energy needs to be applied to the system. Because of the mass–energy equivalence this energy also has a mass-equivalent, which adds to the total mass–energy of the system, .

The total mass equivalent (the gravitating mass) of the body (including its rotational energy) and its irreducible mass are related by
: formula_3

== Wave operator ==
Since even a direct check on the Kerr metric involves cumbersome calculations, the contravariant components of the metric tensor in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates are shown below in the expression for the square of the four-gradient operator:
{\Sigma}\sin^{2}\theta\right) \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right)^{2}- \frac{2r_\text{s}ra}{c\Sigma\Delta} \frac{\partial}{\partial\phi} \frac{\partial}{\partial{t}} +\frac{1}{\Delta\sin^{2}\theta} \left(1 - \frac{r_\text{s}r}{\Sigma}\right) \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial\phi}\right)^{2} + \frac{\Delta}{\Sigma} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\right)^{2} + \frac{1}{\Sigma} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\right)^{2}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

== Frame dragging ==
We may rewrite the Kerr metric () in the following form:
{g_{\phi\phi}} \right) dt^{2} 
+ g_\mathrm{rr} dr^{2} + g_{\theta\theta} d\theta^{2} + g_{\phi\phi} \left( d\phi + \frac{g_{t\phi}}{g_{\phi\phi}} dt \right)^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

This metric is equivalent to a co-rotating reference frame that is rotating with angular speed Ω that depends on both the radius &quot;r&quot; and the colatitude &quot;θ&quot;, where Ω is called the Killing horizon.
{g_{\phi\phi}} = \frac{r_\text{s} r a c}{\Sigma \left( r^{2} + a^{2} \right) + r_\text{s} r a^{2} \sin^{2}\theta}.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Thus, an inertial reference frame is entrained by the rotating central mass to participate in the latter&#x27;s rotation; this is called frame-dragging, and has been tested experimentally.
Qualitatively, frame-dragging can be viewed as the gravitational analog of electromagnetic induction. An &quot;ice skater&quot;, in orbit over the equator and rotationally at rest with respect to the stars, extends her arms. The arm extended toward the black hole will be torqued spinward. The arm extended away from the black hole will be torqued anti-spinward. She will therefore be rotationally sped up, in a counter-rotating sense to the black hole. This is the opposite of what happens in everyday experience. If she is already rotating at a certain speed when she extends her arms, inertial effects and frame-dragging effects will balance and her spin will not change. Due to the equivalence principle, gravitational effects are locally indistinguishable from inertial effects, so this rotation rate, at which when she extends her arms nothing happens, is her local reference for non-rotation. This frame is rotating with respect to the fixed stars and counter-rotating with respect to the black hole. A useful metaphor is a planetary gear system with the black hole being the sun gear, the ice skater being a planetary gear and the outside universe being the ring gear. This can also be interpreted through Mach&#x27;s principle.

== Important surfaces ==

There are several important surfaces in the Kerr metric (). The inner surface corresponds to an event horizon similar to that observed in the Schwarzschild metric; this occurs where the purely radial component &quot;g&quot; of the metric goes to infinity. Solving the quadratic equation yields the solution:
: formula_4
which in natural units (that give ) simplifies to:
: formula_5

While in the Schwarzschild metric the event horizon is also the place where the purely temporal component &quot;g&quot; of the metric changes sign from positive to negative, in Kerr metric that happens at a different distance. Again solving a quadratic equation yields the solution:
: formula_6
or in natural units:
: formula_7

Due to the cos&quot;θ&quot; term in the square root, this outer surface resembles a flattened sphere that touches the inner surface at the poles of the rotation axis, where the colatitude &quot;θ&quot; equals 0 or &quot;π&quot;; the space between these two surfaces is called the ergosphere. Within this volume, the purely temporal component &quot;g&quot; is negative, i.e., acts like a purely spatial metric component. Consequently, particles within this ergosphere must co-rotate with the inner mass, if they are to retain their time-like character. A moving particle experiences a positive proper time along its worldline, its path through spacetime. However, this is impossible within the ergosphere, where &quot;g&quot; is negative, unless the particle is co-rotating around the interior mass  with an angular speed at least of . Thus, no particle can move in the direction opposite to central mass&#x27;s rotation within the ergosphere.

As with the event horizon in the Schwarzschild metric, the apparent singularity at &quot;r&quot; is due to the choice of coordinates (i.e., it is a coordinate singularity). In fact, the spacetime can be smoothly continued through it by an appropriate choice of coordinates. In turn, the outer boundary of the ergosphere at &quot;r&quot; is not singular by itself even in Kerr coordinates due to non-zero term.

== Ergosphere and the Penrose process ==

A black hole in general is surrounded by a surface, called the event horizon and situated at the Schwarzschild radius for a nonrotating black hole, where the escape velocity is equal to the velocity of light. Within this surface, no observer/particle can maintain itself at a constant radius. It is forced to fall inwards, and so this is sometimes called the &quot;static limit&quot;.
A rotating black hole has the same static limit at its event horizon but there is an additional surface outside the event horizon named the &quot;ergosurface&quot; given by
: formula_8
in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates, which can be intuitively characterized as the sphere where &quot;the rotational velocity of the surrounding space&quot; is dragged along with the velocity of light. Within this sphere the dragging is greater than the speed of light, and any observer/particle is forced to co-rotate.

The region outside the event horizon but inside the surface where the rotational velocity is the speed of light, is called the &quot;ergosphere&quot; (from Greek &quot;ergon&quot; meaning &quot;work&quot;). Particles falling within the ergosphere are forced to rotate faster and thereby gain energy. Because they are still outside the event horizon, they may escape the black hole. The net process is that the rotating black hole emits energetic particles at the cost of its own total energy. The possibility of extracting spin energy from a rotating black hole was first proposed by the mathematician Roger Penrose in 1969 and is thus called the Penrose process. Rotating black holes in astrophysics are a potential source of large amounts of energy and are used to explain energetic phenomena, such as gamma-ray bursts.

== Features ==
The Kerr geometry exhibits many noteworthy features: the maximal analytic extension includes a sequence of asymptotically flat exterior regions, each associated with an ergosphere, stationary limit surfaces, event horizons, Cauchy horizons, closed timelike curves, and a ring-shaped curvature singularity. The geodesic equation can be solved exactly in closed form. In addition to two Killing vector fields (corresponding to &quot;time translation&quot; and &quot;axisymmetry&quot;), the Kerr geometry admits a remarkable Killing tensor. There is a pair of principal null congruences (one &quot;ingoing&quot; and one &quot;outgoing&quot;). The Weyl tensor is algebraically special, in fact it has Petrov type D. The global structure is known. Topologically, the homotopy type of the Kerr spacetime can be simply characterized as a line with circles attached at each integer point.

Note that the inner Kerr geometry is unstable with regard to perturbations in the interior region. This instability means that although the Kerr metric is axis-symmetric, a black hole created through gravitational collapse may not be so. This instability also implies that many of the features of the Kerr geometry described above may not be present inside such a black hole.

A surface on which light can orbit a black hole is called a photon sphere. The Kerr solution has infinitely many photon spheres, lying between an inner one and an outer one. In the nonrotating, Schwarzschild solution, with , the inner and outer photon spheres degenerate, so that there is only one photon sphere at a single radius. The greater the spin of a black hole, the farther from each other the inner and outer photon spheres move. A beam of light traveling in a direction opposite to the spin of the black hole will circularly orbit the hole at the outer photon sphere. A beam of light traveling in the same direction as the black hole&#x27;s spin will circularly orbit at the inner photon sphere. Orbiting geodesics with some angular momentum perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the black hole will orbit on photon spheres between these two extremes. Because the spacetime is rotating, such orbits exhibit a precession, since there is a shift in the variable after completing one period in the variable.

=== Trajectory equations ===

The equations of motion for test particles in the Kerr spacetime are governed by four constants of motion. The first is the invariant mass of the test particle, defined by the relation
formula_9
where is the four-momentum of the particle. Furthermore, there are two constants of motion given by the time translation and rotation symmetries of Kerr spacetime, the energy , and the component of the orbital angular momentum parallel to the spin of the black hole .
formula_10 and
formula_11

Using Hamilton–Jacobi theory, Brandon Carter showed that there exists a fourth constant of motion, , now referred to as the Carter constant. It is related to the total angular momentum of the particle and is given by
formula_12

Since there are four (independent) constants of motion for degrees of freedom, the equations of motion for a test particle in Kerr spacetime are integrable.

Using these constants of motion, the trajectory equations for a test particle can be written (using natural units of ),
formula_13
with
* formula_14
* formula_15
* formula_16
where is an affine parameter such that . In particular, when the affine parameter , is related to the proper time through .

Because of the frame-dragging-effect, a zero-angular-momentum observer (ZAMO) is corotating with the angular velocity which is defined with respect to the bookkeeper&#x27;s coordinate time . The local velocity of the test-particle is measured relative to a probe corotating with . The gravitational time-dilation between a ZAMO at fixed and a stationary observer far away from the mass is
formula_17
In Cartesian Kerr–Schild coordinates, the equations for a photon are
formula_18
formula_19
where is analogous to Carter&#x27;s constant and is a useful quantity
formula_20
formula_21

If we set , the Schwarzschild geodesics are restored.

== Symmetries ==
The group of isometries of the Kerr metric is the subgroup of the ten-dimensional Poincaré group which takes the two-dimensional locus of the singularity to itself. It retains the time translations (one dimension) and rotations around its axis of rotation (one dimension). Thus it has two dimensions. Like the Poincaré group, it has four connected components: the component of the identity; the component which reverses time and longitude; the component which reflects through the equatorial plane; and the component that does both.

In physics, symmetries are typically associated with conserved constants of motion, in accordance with Noether&#x27;s theorem. As shown above, the geodesic equations have four conserved quantities: one of which comes from the definition of a geodesic, and two of which arise from the time translation and rotation symmetry of the Kerr geometry. The fourth conserved quantity does not arise from a symmetry in the standard sense and is commonly referred to as a hidden symmetry.

== Overextreme Kerr solutions ==
The location of the event horizon is determined by the larger root of . When (i.e. ), there are no (real valued) solutions to this equation, and there is no event horizon. With no event horizons to hide it from the rest of the universe, the black hole ceases to be a black hole and will instead be a naked singularity.

== Kerr black holes as wormholes ==
Although the Kerr solution appears to be singular at the roots of , these are actually coordinate singularities, and, with an appropriate choice of new coordinates, the Kerr solution can be smoothly extended through the values of corresponding to these roots. The larger of these roots determines the location of the event horizon, and the smaller determines the location of a Cauchy horizon. A (future-directed, time-like) curve can start in the exterior and pass through the event horizon. Once having passed through the event horizon, the coordinate now behaves like a time coordinate, so it must decrease until the curve passes through the Cauchy horizon.

== Anti-universe region ==

The Kerr metric, which describes the spacetime geometry around a rotating black hole, can be extended beyond the inner event horizon. In the Boyer-Lindquist coordinate system formula_22, this inner horizon is located at

formula_23

As one crosses this inner horizon, the radial coordinate formula_24 continues to decrease, even becoming negative.

=== The ring singularity and beyond ===

At formula_25, a peculiar feature arises: a ring singularity. Unlike the point singularity in the Schwarzschild metric (a non-rotating black hole), the Kerr singularity is not a single point but a ring lying in the equatorial plane (formula_26). This ring singularity acts as a portal to a new region of spacetime.

If we avoid the equatorial plane (formula_27), we can smoothly continue the coordinate formula_24 to negative values. This region with formula_29 is interpreted as an entirely new, asymptotically flat universe, often called the &quot;anti-universe.&quot; This anti-universe has some surprising properties:

Negative ADM Mass: The anti-universe possesses a negative Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass, which can be thought of as the total mass-energy of the spacetime as measured at infinity. A negative mass is a highly unusual concept in general relativity, and its physical interpretation is still debated.

=== Closed timelike curves and the Cauchy horizon ===

Within the anti-universe, an even stranger phenomenon occurs. The metric component formula_30, which is related to the azimuthal direction around the ring singularity, can change sign. Specifically, formula_30 is given by:

formula_32

When formula_30 becomes negative, the coordinate formula_34 becomes timelike, and a linear combination of the coordinates formula_35 and formula_34 becomes spacelike. This leads to the existence of closed timelike curves (CTCs). A CTC is a path through spacetime where an object could travel back to its own past, violating causality.

The boundary where formula_30 changes sign and CTCs first appear is called the Cauchy horizon. It is defined by the condition formula_38, which gives

formula_39

The Cauchy horizon acts as a boundary beyond which the familiar notions of cause and effect break down. The presence of CTCs raises fundamental questions about the predictability and consistency of the laws of physics in these extreme regions of spacetime.

The anti-universe region of the extended Kerr metric is a fascinating and perplexing theoretical construct. It presents a scenario with a negative mass, reversed time orientation, and the possibility of time travel through closed timelike curves. While the physical reality of the anti-universe remains uncertain, its study provides valuable insights into the nature of spacetime, gravity, and the limits of our current understanding of the universe.

While it is expected that the exterior region of the Kerr solution is stable, and that all rotating black holes will eventually approach a Kerr metric, the interior region of the solution appears to be unstable, much like a pencil balanced on its point. This is related to the idea of cosmic censorship.

== Relation to other exact solutions ==
The Kerr geometry is a particular example of a stationary axially symmetric vacuum solution to the Einstein field equation. The family of all stationary axially symmetric vacuum solutions to the Einstein field equation are the Ernst vacuums.

The Kerr solution is also related to various non-vacuum solutions which model black holes. For example, the Kerr–Newman electrovacuum models a (rotating) black hole endowed with an electric charge, while the Kerr–Vaidya null dust models a (rotating) hole with infalling electromagnetic radiation.

The special case of the Kerr metric yields the Schwarzschild metric, which models a &quot;nonrotating&quot; black hole which is static and spherically symmetric, in the Schwarzschild coordinates. (In this case, every Geroch moment but the mass vanishes.)

The &quot;interior&quot; of the Kerr geometry, or rather a portion of it, is locally isometric to the Chandrasekhar–Ferrari CPW vacuum, an example of a colliding plane wave model. This is particularly interesting, because the global structure of this CPW solution is quite different from that of the Kerr geometry, and in principle, an experimenter could hope to study the geometry of (the outer portion of) the Kerr interior by arranging the collision of two suitable gravitational plane waves.

== Multipole moments ==
Each asymptotically flat Ernst vacuum can be characterized by giving the infinite sequence of relativistic multipole moments, the first two of which can be interpreted as the mass and angular momentum of the source of the field. There are alternative formulations of relativistic multipole moments due to Hansen, Thorne, and Geroch, which turn out to agree with each other. The relativistic multipole moments of the Kerr geometry were computed by Hansen; they turn out to be
: formula_40

Thus, the special case of the Schwarzschild vacuum () gives the &quot;monopole point source&quot; of general relativity.

&quot;Weyl multipole moments&quot; arise from treating a certain metric function (formally corresponding to Newtonian gravitational potential) which appears the Weyl–Papapetrou chart for the Ernst family of all stationary axisymmetric vacuum solutions using the standard euclidean scalar multipole moments. They are distinct from the moments computed by Hansen, above. In a sense, the Weyl moments only (indirectly) characterize the &quot;mass distribution&quot; of an isolated source, and they turn out to depend only on the &quot;even order&quot; relativistic moments. In the case of solutions symmetric across the equatorial plane the &quot;odd order&quot; Weyl moments vanish. For the Kerr vacuum solutions, the first few Weyl moments are given by
: formula_41

In particular, we see that the Schwarzschild vacuum has nonzero second order Weyl moment, corresponding to the fact that the &quot;Weyl monopole&quot; is the Chazy–Curzon vacuum solution, not the Schwarzschild vacuum solution, which arises from the Newtonian potential of a certain finite length uniform density thin &quot;rod&quot;.

In weak field general relativity, it is convenient to treat isolated sources using another type of multipole, which generalize the Weyl moments to &quot;mass multipole moments&quot; and &quot;momentum multipole moments&quot;, characterizing respectively the distribution of mass and of momentum of the source. These are multi-indexed quantities whose suitably symmetrized and anti-symmetrized parts can be related to the real and imaginary parts of the relativistic moments for the full nonlinear theory in a rather complicated manner.

Perez and Moreschi have given an alternative notion of &quot;monopole solutions&quot; by expanding the standard NP tetrad of the Ernst vacuums in powers of (the radial coordinate in the Weyl–Papapetrou chart). According to this formulation:
* the isolated mass monopole source with &quot;zero&quot; angular momentum is the &quot;Schwarzschild vacuum&quot; family (one parameter),
* the isolated mass monopole source with &quot;radial&quot; angular momentum is the &quot;Taub–NUT vacuum&quot; family (two parameters; not quite asymptotically flat),
* the isolated mass monopole source with &quot;axial&quot; angular momentum is the &quot;Kerr vacuum&quot; family (two parameters).
In this sense, the Kerr vacuums are the simplest stationary axisymmetric asymptotically flat vacuum solutions in general relativity.

== Open problems ==
The Kerr geometry is often used as a model of a rotating black hole but if the solution is held to be valid only outside some compact region (subject to certain restrictions), in principle, it should be able to be used as an exterior solution to model the gravitational field around a rotating massive object other than a black hole such as a neutron star, or the Earth. This works out very nicely for the non-rotating case, where the Schwarzschild vacuum exterior can be matched to a Schwarzschild fluid interior, and indeed to more general static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions. However, the problem of finding a rotating perfect-fluid interior which can be matched to a Kerr exterior, or indeed to any asymptotically flat vacuum exterior solution, has proven very difficult. In particular, the Wahlquist fluid, which was once thought to be a candidate for matching to a Kerr exterior, is now known not to admit any such matching. At present, it seems that only approximate solutions modeling slowly rotating fluid balls are known (These are the relativistic analog of oblate spheroidal balls with nonzero mass and angular momentum but vanishing higher multipole moments). However, the exterior of the Neugebauer–Meinel disk, an exact dust solution which models a rotating thin disk, approaches in a limiting case the Kerr geometry. Physical thin-disk solutions obtained by identifying parts of the Kerr spacetime are also known.

<text>Java or Dzau ( ; , &quot;Dzaw&quot;; &quot;Dzhava&quot;) is a town of approximately 1,500 people in the disputed &quot;de facto&quot; independent Republic of South Ossetia, internationally considered part of Shida Kartli, Georgia (except by the Russian Federation and four other UN member states). According to Georgia&#x27;s current official administrative division, Java is a main town of Java district in the north of Shida Kartli region. According to the South Ossetian side Dzau is an administrative center of Dzau district. The town is situated on the southern slopes of the Greater Caucasus, within the Greater Liakhvi Gorge, above sea level. 

Java is the second largest urban settlement in South Ossetia, after Tskhinvali. It is located outside the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe-defined boundaries of the Georgian-Ossetian conflict zone – an area within a 15-km radius of Tskhinvali.

The town played a major role in the Russo-Georgian War, with most of the South Ossetian military forces being located there at the time of the Georgian offensive. During the Battle of Tskhinvali, the government of South Ossetia relocated to Java. 

Georgia had accused the Russian military of building a large military base in Java before the war. These concerns were brought by the President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, to the attention of the UN General Assembly on September 26, 2007. After the war, Russia announced it was constructing military bases in Java and Tskhinvali, which would be ready in 2010.

<text>Baron Clinton is a title in the Peerage of England. Created in 1298 for Sir John de Clinton, it is the seventh-oldest barony in England.

==Creation and early history==
The title was granted in 1298 to Sir John de Clinton, a knight who had served in the Scottish and French wars. The peerage was created by writ, which means that it can descend through both male and female lines. It is thus one of the most ancient English titles still in existence.

William, the younger son of the first Baron, was also summoned to parliament by writ on 6 September 1330 as Baron de Clynton, even though his elder brother, the second Baron, was sitting in parliament under the same title. He was created Earl of Huntingdon in 1337.

The second Baron, John, fought with the king&#x27;s army, which defeated Edward II&#x27;s cousin Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1321. He was knighted by 1324. The third Baron fought at the Battle of Poitiers in the Hundred Years&#x27; War and was the Constable of Warwick Castle (1390-97). He married at least three times. His first wife, Idonea de Saye, was the daughter of Geoffrey de Saye, 2nd Lord Saye. He was succeeded in the barony by their grandson, son of their son Sir William Clinton (&quot;DVP&quot; 25 October 1383).

In 1399, upon the death of the fourth Baron&#x27;s cousin, Elizabeth de Saye de Falvesley Heron, Baroness Saye, the fourth Baron succeeded to the Saye lands and styled himself Lord Saye. He married three times; firstly, to Anne Trivett, daughter of Sir Thomas Trivett; secondly, to Alice or Anne FitzWarin, daughter of the 2nd Baron Botreaux and the widow of the 6th Lord Fitzwarin; and thirdly to Mary Retford, widow of Sir Henry Retford.

He was succeeded by his son from his second marriage. The fifth Baron fought on the Yorkist side in the Wars of the Roses. He was attainted in 1461 but later restored to his title. The sixth Baron was recognised in 1471 as Lord Clinton and Saye, but was not called to Parliament under either title. He married Elisabeth, daughter of Sir Richard Fiennes, and took Fiennes as an alias, and Clinton and Saye baronies continued to be linked for several generations. The 10th and 11th Barons were called to Parliament as Baron Clinton de Saye.

Edward Clinton, 9th Baron Clinton was created Earl of Lincoln in 1572. The titles remained united until 1692 upon the death of his great-great-great-grandson, Edward de Clinton, fifth Earl of Lincoln and 13th Baron Clinton. The earldom was inherited by the late Earl&#x27;s cousin, the sixth Earl (see the Earl of Lincoln for later history of this title) while the barony fell into abeyance between the issue of his two aunts, Lady Margaret Clinton (d. 1688) and Lady Arabella Clinton, the daughters of Theophilus de Clinton, 4th Earl of Lincoln and 12th Baron Clinton.

==Barony into first abeyance==

The abeyance of 1692 was terminated in 1721 in favour of Hugh Fortescue (d. 1751), fourteenth Baron Clinton, the grandson of Lady Margaret Clinton (d. 1688), the eldest daughter of Theophilus de Clinton, 4th Earl of Lincoln and 12th Baron Clinton (d. 1667). Lady Margaret had married Hugh Boscawen (1625–1701), MP, of Tregothnan in Cornwall, and their daughter Bridget Boscawen (d. 1708) married Hugh Fortescue (1665–1719) (son of Arthur Fortescue by Barbara Elford) and had issue Sir Hugh Fortescue (d. 1751). In 1746, he was created Baron Fortescue, of Castle Hill in the County of Devon (with remainder to his half-brother Matthew Fortescue) and Earl Clinton, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. The Earl was childless and on his death the earldom of Clinton became extinct but his two baronies continued. He was succeeded in the barony of Fortescue (according to the special remainder) by his half-brother, the second Baron Fortescue (see Earl Fortescue for later history of this title). The barony of Clinton was inherited by his second cousin Margaret Rolle, 15th Baroness Clinton, the granddaughter of Lady Arabella Clinton, the younger daughter of Theophilus de Clinton, 4th Earl of Lincoln and 12th Baron Clinton (d. 1667). Margaret Rolle was the widow of Robert Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford (d. 1751) and the daughter of Samuel Rolle, the son of Robert Rolle (d. 1660), MP, of Heanton Satchville, Devon, by his wife Lady Arabella Clinton. She was succeeded by her son, George Walpole, third Earl of Orford and 16th Baron Clinton (d. 1791). He was childless and on his death in 1791 the earldom passed to his uncle, the fourth Earl of Orford (see the Earl of Orford for later history of this title), while the barony of Clinton became dormant.

==Barony dormant==
The barony, which had been dormant since 1791, was successfully claimed in 1794 by the late Earl of Orford&#x27;s cousin Robert George William Trefusis (1764–1797), who became the 17th Baron Clinton. He was the three-times great-grandson of Lady Arabella Clinton, the younger daughter of the fourth Earl of Lincoln. Lady Arabella&#x27;s daughter Bridget Rolle had married Francis Trefusis of Trefusis in Cornwall, and had issue Samuel Trefusis (1677–1724), whose great-grandson was the 17th Baron Clinton.

The 18th Baron served as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to the Duke of Wellington during the Peninsular War. He was succeeded by his younger brother, who represented Callington in the House of Commons, in which role he was notable. He was succeeded by his son, the 20th Baron Clinton (1834–1904). He served as Under-Secretary of State for India from 1867 to 1868 in the Conservative administrations of the Earl of Derby and Benjamin Disraeli and was also Lord Lieutenant of Devonshire. In 1867 Baron Clinton assumed by Royal licence the additional surnames of Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes, which were those of his father-in-law. His son, the 21st Baron, held minor office in the coalition government of David Lloyd George and served as Lord Warden of the Stannaries.

==Barony into second abeyance==
Following the death of the 21st Baron Clinton on 5 July 1957, the barony fell into abeyance between his two daughters: The Hon. Harriet Fane (14 November 1887 – 15 March 1958), who married Maj. Henry Nevile Fane, only son of Sir Edmund Fane (whom she divorced in 1935); and the Hon. Fenella Bowes-Lyon (19 August 1889 – 19 July 1966), an aunt of Queen Elizabeth II through her marriage to John Bowes-Lyon, second son of the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. The abeyance of 1957 was terminated 18 March 1965 in favour of Gerald Neville Mark Fane Trefusis, the 22nd Lord Clinton, who was the great-grandson of the 21st Baron Clinton and grandson of Hon. Harriet Fane. His great-aunt Fenella supported his eight-year legal fight to succeed as baron. Baron Clinton had already in 1958 assumed by deed poll the additional surname of Trefusis and had inherited the 85,000-acre estate in Devon from his great-grandfather.

==Residences==
The family seat is Heanton Satchville, Huish, near Merton in North Devon, which was built in 1782 as &quot;Innis House&quot; by James Innis, Duke of Roxburgh, and was purchased by the 18th Baron Clinton in about 1805, renamed Heanton Satchville, which burned down in 1935 and was rebuilt.

After the death of Hon. Mark Rolle in 1907, Bicton House became the main residence of the 21st Baron Clinton until his death in 1957, where much grand entertaining occurred until the start of World War II and where a herd of 150 deer were kept in the park. The Duke and Duchess of York spent part of their honeymoon there.

The 1st Baron resided at Maxstoke Castle, Warwickshire, the inheritance of his wife. The 5th Baron exchanged it for lands in Northamptonshire. The 9th Baron&#x27;s chief seat was in Lincolnshire on an estate which was the inheritance of his wife Elizabeth Blount. The seat of the 14th Baron Clinton was Castle Hill, Filleigh, rebuilt by him in the Palladian style. The seat of the 15th Baroness was Heanton Satchville, Petrockstowe, the ancient Rolle seat, although she spent the later part of her life on the Continent, having left her first husband, and died in Pisa. Her son the 16th Baron largely abandoned that residence in favour of Houghton Hall in Norfolk. Although he had the legal power to do so, he did not end the tail-male of the Rolle estates, and the estates thus passed to the Trefusis family not to his own heirs male the Lords Cholmondely, heirs to the Walpole estates, who unsuccessfully claimed the Rolle estates from the 18th Baron Clinton in a lengthy court case. Heanton Satchville, Petrockstowe became the seat of the 17th Baron only for a short time as it burnt down in 1795 and he died two years later. His son the 18th Baron when he came of age purchased Innes House on the other side of a marshy valley in the parish of Huish and renamed it Heanton Satchville.

<text>A parterre is a part of a formal garden constructed on a level substrate, consisting of symmetrical patterns, made up by plant beds, plats, low hedges or coloured gravels, which are separated and connected by paths. Typically it was the part of the garden nearest the house, perhaps after a terrace. The view of a parterre from inside the house, especially from the upper floors, was a major consideration in its design. The word &quot;parterre&quot; was and is used both for the whole part of the garden containing parterres and for each individual section between the &quot;alleys&quot;.

The pattern or the borders of the beds may be marked by low, tightly pruned, evergreen hedging, and their interiors may be planted with flowers or other plants or filled with mulch or gravel. Parterres need not have any flowers at all, and the originals from the 17th and 18th centuries had far fewer than modern survivals or reconstructions. Statues or small evergreen trees, clipped as pyramids or other shapes, often marked points in the pattern, and an &quot;allée&quot; of medium-sized trees often ran along the side. Otherwise, the parterre was normally an area of openness, with the various elements very low, contrasting with the height of the house, and with the taller areas of the garden beyond. This made the parterre both a place to be seen - typically everyone walking in the parterre, and observers from around it, could see everyone else - but also a place for the most private conversations, as no one else could approach without being seen. The paths are constituted with gravel or (much less often in historical examples) with turf grass.

French parterres developed from the patterned compartments of French Renaissance gardens, what are called in England &quot;knot gardens&quot;. Later, in the 17th century Baroque garden, they became more elaborate and stylised, on the continent often using the &quot;parterre en broderie&quot; style of spreading and curving branches, derived from embroidery. The French formal garden parterre inspired many similar parterres throughout Europe, though the parterres in the gardens of Versailles are rather muted; those in palace gardens in the Holy Roman Empire and in eventually Russian-controlled eastern Europe, are often more extensive and extravagant.

Parterre-style areas reappeared in many large gardens from the mid-19th century, now much more lavishly planted with bedded-out flowers, and with less strictly geometrical designs. From around the mid-20th century, as interest in Baroque gardens revived, garden designers have made many attempts to recreate or to restore Baroque parterres, at least as regards the layout; planting often continues to be much thicker, and the height of hedges higher, than would have been the case in the originals.

==History==
Claude Mollet, from a dynasty of nurserymen-designers that lasted into the 18th century, developed the parterre in France. His inspiration in developing the 16th-century patterned &quot;compartimens&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, simple interlaces formed of herbs, either open and infilled with sand, or closed and filled with flowers) was the painter Etienne du Pérac, who returned from Italy to the Château d&#x27;Anet near Dreux, France, where he and Mollet were working. Around 1595, Mollet introduced compartment-patterned parterres to the royal gardens of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Fontainebleau. The fully developed scrolling embroidery-like &quot;parterres en broderie&quot; first appear in Alexandre Francini&#x27;s engraved views of the revised horticultural plans of Fontainebleau and Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1614.

Clipped boxwood met with resistance from horticultural patrons for its &quot;naughtie smell&quot; as the herbalist Gervase Markham described it. By 1638, Jacques Boyceau described the range of designs in boxwood that a horticulturist should be able to cultivate:

Parterres are the low embellishments of gardens, which have great grace, especially when seen from an elevated position: they are made of borders of several shrubs and sub-shrubs of various colours, fashioned in different manners, as compartments, foliage, embroideries (&quot;passements&quot;), moresques, arabesques, grotesques, guilloches, rosettes, sunbursts (&quot;gloires&quot;), escutcheons, coats-of-arms, monograms and emblems (&quot;devises&quot;).
By the 1630s, elaborate &quot;parterres de broderie&quot; appeared at Wilton House in Wilton, England, that were so magnificent that they were engraved, which engraving is the only remaining trace of them. &quot;&quot;Parterres de pelouse&quot; or &quot;parterres de gazon&quot; denominate cutwork parterres of low growing herbs (&quot;e.g.&quot;, camomile) as much as closely scythed turf grass. The separation of plant beds of a parterre is denominated an &quot;alley of compartiment&quot;&quot;.

But these remained relatively rare in England, where many earlier knot gardens were replaced with simpler designs of &quot;quincunxes, squares or rectangles of grass set in gravel with perhaps some topiary, statues or plants in pots at the corners&quot;.
Many parterre designs were only &quot;cutwork&quot; in grass and gravel, often of different colours. Reddish &quot;brick dust&quot;, mostly brick waste crushed to gravel-sized pieces, was a popular addition to stone. These required less maintenance, and looked good from the upper storeys of the house. In country houses the owner was often only in residence in the summer, when the relatively small range of flowers available at the time had mostly finished their display. Stephen Switzer, an English gardener of the early 18th century, advised against using flowers at all in country house gardens for this reason, an extreme position, not often followed:the nobler Diversions of the Country take place ... [after the end of May]... when the Beauty of Flowers is gone, and Borders are like Graves, and rather a Blemish than Beauty to our finest gardens.
In top gardens flowers in parterres were typically grown in pots in the greenhouse, and placed into the parterre only for as long as their blooms lasted. This was the system at the Grand Trianon sub-palace at Versailles, where the king is said to have arrived for dinner with the garden in one colour of flowers, which had all been changed to another colour by the time he left. The relatively small and enclosed garden of the Trianon, originally called the &quot;Palace of Flora&quot;, was in effect the flower garden of Versailles, and Le Notre said in 1694 that 2,000,000 flower pots were used there over a year.

Parterre gardens lost favour in the 18th century and were superseded, within the naturalistic English landscape garden style, which emerged in England from the 1720s by flower gardens, or shrubberies from the mid-century, both very often planned round a snake-like serpentine path. In particular, Capability Brown, the most prolific garden designer of the mid-century, often brought a wide lawn right up to the terrace of the main garden front, to give Neoclassical houses the appearance of classical buildings in paintings by artists such as Claude Lorrain. Many English parterres were dug up as a result. The flowering plants were often moved to the side of the house.

===&quot;Parterres en broderie&quot;===
The &quot;parterre en broderie&quot; took its name from contemporary styles of metalwork embroidery (&quot;broderie&quot; in French), then used in the most formal clothes of both men and women at court. Similar styles live on in the goldwork embroidery on diplomatic uniforms which some, mostly European, countries continue to use to the present day. At the time this style of ornament was used in many media in the decorative arts. The main motifs are usually wreaths and strapwork, more rarely they are in the shape of monograms and figures.

Generally any hedging was very low, to enable the patterns to be readable from the main rooms facing the garden of the &quot;bel étage&quot; of the house. New houses were often given wide high terraces, from which the parterre could be admired; these were filled in summer with greenhouse plants in pots. No Baroque broderie parterres have been preserved in their entirety in the original, but in the late 20th century there have been increasing attempts to reconstruct them. In Germany, for example, those of Schloss Augustusburg in Brühl (around 1730) or Schwetzingen (1753–1758) have been reconstructed.

In England &quot;parterres en broderie&quot; were always rare, &quot;probably there were never more than twenty examples of it in the whole of England&quot;. However, Hampton Court was one prominent example.

===Plats===

A plat (in America entangled with the same word as used for a plot of building land) was a parterre section of plain grass lawn, perhaps with a central feature such as a fountain or statue, and small clipped trees at the corners. A stretch of good lawn was much admired, and these were rather surprisingly popular, especially in England, where year-round rainfall usually meant summer watering was unnecessary to keep a green surface. Other terms included &quot;tapis vert&quot; (&quot;green carpet&quot;), the name given to the huge one in the Gardens of Versailles. In French &quot;plat&quot; means &quot;flat&quot;.
The placing of plats in the most prominent positions of the &quot;best garden&quot; seems to have begun in England in the 1630s, and over the rest of the century a parterre section entirely consisting of plats became a distinct English style, probably used in most gardens, especially those of the gentry rather than noble magnates. Among the royal palaces, Somerset House was converted by Inigo Jones in the 1630s, and the Privy Gardens at Hampton Court Palace and Whitehall Palace by 1640. Whitehall had 16 relatively small plats with statues in the middle, and in 1662 a much larger bowling-green was added alongside.

A plat could double as a bowling-green for early versions of lawn bowls, a highly popular, mostly male, sport in England. There were other forms of ground billiards and lawn games, that evolved in the 19th century into sports such as croquet and lawn tennis. Before 1600 plats had already become usual for forecourts, which were left plain so as not to distract from the entrance front of the house.

The English gardener Stephen Switzer wrote in 1718:Bowling-green or plain Parterres, the Method of which they [the French] own to have receiv’d from England, ... [are] of the most Use, and is, above all, the beautifullest with us in England, on Account of the Goodness of our Turf, and that Decency and unaffected Simplicity which it affords to the Eye of the Beholder.

On the continent a &quot;boulingrin&quot; (a mangled French version of &quot;bowling-green&quot;) was a sunken compartment of fine lawn, typically found in the bosquet part of the garden rather than among the parterres. In French the name is also used for the game of bowls, and the greens it is played on. Several French writers were ready to concede the superiority of English grass, including Andre Mollet and Dezallier d&#x27;Argenville; apart from the climate some attributed it to the selection of the turf and the frequency and quality of the cutting.

Plats typically came in pairs, one on each side of an allée down the central axis. The garden at Ham House near London has been restored, following extensive research, to have a parterre of eight plats, four wide and two deep, facing the main garden front, with a replanted wilderness beyond. At the side of the house is a smaller and more complicated parterre in compartments, with flowers, now called the &quot;Cherry Garden&quot;. Perhaps as a concession to modern taste, the plats are now planted with 500,000 spring bulbs and wild flowers, which are unlikely to have been an original feature.

To the French a &quot;parterre anglais&quot; (or &quot;a la anglais&quot; or &quot;a la angloise&quot;) meant in the Baroque period a plat edged with a thin border (&quot;plate-bande&quot;) of low flowers. Antoine Dezallier d’Argenville&#x27;s English translation, &quot;The Theory and Practice of Gardening&quot; (1712) described these:PARTERRES after the English Manner are the plainest and meanest of all. They should consist only of large Grass-plots all of a Piece, or cut but little, and be encompassed with a Border of Flowers, separated from the Grass-work by a Path of Two or Three Foot wide, laid smooth and sanded over, to make the greater Distinction
As well as grass, English writers including Samuel Pepys and Sir William Temple also congratulated themselves on the superiority of the native gravels. From about 1670, perhaps under the influence of Versailles, those English owners who could afford them began to install fountains, generally where alleys between plats met up. Statues in or around 17th-century English parterres tended to be castings in lead from the Low Countries, painted to resemble marble or bronze.

===Compartmented parterres===
The third main type of parterre covered a wide range of often rather complicated designs, many harking back to the knot garden. &quot;Open knots&quot; were complicated designs without interlacing; many gentry owners designed these themselves. These were often more heavily planted with flowering plants, and this style was often used for flower gardens at the side of the house. At its simplest it might just be a group of rectangular flower beds, with alleys around them, or designs in &quot;cutwork&quot;.

===Revival===
In the 19th century parterres were revived in a somewhat different form, coinciding with the availability of carpet bedding, the annual mass planting of non-hardy flowers as segments of colour which constituted a design. Level substrates and a raised vantage point from which to view the design were required, and so the parterre was revived in a modified style. By now a parterre often meant a collection of flower beds in fairly formal shapes, but often avoiding straight lines, arranged on a lawn, perhaps with some gravel paths, as at Waddesdon Manor, a new-build of the late 1870s.

Jane Loudon&#x27;s &quot;Gardening for Ladies&quot; (1845) says: Parterres of embroidery are now rarely to be met with either in France or England... Parterres of compartments... are at present common both in France and England...In a word, parterres are now assemblages of flowers in beds or groups, either on a ground of lawn or gravel... The shape of the beds in either case depends on the style of architecture of the house to which the parterre belongs, or to the taste and fancy of the owner. Whatever shapes are adopted, they are generally combined into a symmetrical figure; for when this is not the case the collection of beds ceases to be a parterre, or a flower-garden...In planting parterres there are two different systems; one is to plant only one kind of flower in a bed so as that each bed shall be a mass of one colour, and the other is to plant flowers of different colours in the same bed.

From the 20th century, apart from a few projects aimed at an authentic restoration, where enough information on the old designs exists, newly planted parterres tend to be small but with complex knot-type designs, much more thickly planted and often with higher box edges than would have been the case in the originals. A much larger number of Victorian parterres have survived in something like their original state, both in houses and public parks and other gardens, and these remain attractive to modern visitors.

Many restored parterres are increasingly threatened by fungi and insects, especially the box tree moth, and alternative species are being explored, for example at RHS Wisley.

==Examples==

Parterres tended to survive better the further east one went in Europe, and the imperial Russian palaces have many of the best remaining examples.

At Kensington Palace, the planting of the parterres was by Henry Wise, whose nursery was nearby at Brompton. In an engraving from 1707 to 1708, the up-to-date Baroque designs of each section are clipped scrolling designs, symmetrical around a centre, in low hedging punctuated by trees formally clipped into cones; however, their traditional 17th century layout, a broad central gravel walk dividing paired plats, each subdivided in four, appears to have survived from the Palace&#x27;s former (pre-1689) existence as Nottingham House. Subsidiary wings have subsidiary parterres, with no attempt at overall integration.

At Prince Eugene&#x27;s Belvedere Palace, Vienna, a sunken parterre before the façade that faced the city was flanked in a traditional fashion with raised walks from which the pattern could best be appreciated. To either side, walls with busts on herm pedestals backed by young trees screen the parterre from the flanking garden spaces. Formal baroque patterns have given way to symmetrical paired free scrolling rococo arabesques, against the gravel ground. Little attempt seems to have been made to fit the framework to the shape of the parterre. Beyond (in the shadowed near foreground) paired basins have central jets of water.

In the UK, modern parterres exist at Trereife House in Penzance (Cornwall), at Drumlanrig Castle in Dumfriesshire and at Bodysgallen Hall near Llandudno. Examples can also be found in Ireland, such as at Birr Castle. One of the largest in Britain is at Cliveden in Buckinghamshire, which covers an area of ; it consists of symmetrical wedge-shaped beds filled with &quot;Nepeta&quot; (&quot;catmint&quot;), &quot;Santolina&quot; and &quot;Senecio&quot;, edged with box hedges. Sentinel pyramids of yew stand at the corners. Some early knot gardens have been covered over by lawn or other landscaping but the traces are visible as undulations in the present day landscape. An example of this phenomenon is the early 17th-century garden of Muchalls Castle in Scotland. At Charlecote Park in Warwickshire the original parterre from the 1800s has been recreated on the terrace overlooking the river.

<doc id="456728" wikidata="Q449058" url="?curid=456728" title="Reflexology">
<text>Reflexology, also known as zone therapy, is an alternative medical practice involving the application of pressure to specific points on the feet, ears, and hands. This is done using thumb, finger, and hand massage techniques without the use of oil or lotion. It is based on a pseudoscientific system of zones and reflex areas that purportedly reflect an image of the body on the feet and hands, with the premise that such work on the feet and hands causes a physical change to the supposedly related areas of the body.

There is no convincing scientific evidence that reflexology is effective for any medical condition.

==Definition==
In a Cochrane Collaboration review, reflexology is defined as follows: &quot;Reflexology is gentle manipulation or pressing on certain parts of the foot to produce an effect elsewhere in the body.&quot;

The Australian Government&#x27;s Department of Health define reflexology as &quot;a system of applying pressure, usually to the feet, which practitioners believe stimulates energy and releases &#x27;blockages&#x27; in specific areas that cause pain or illness.&quot;

==History==
Practices resembling reflexology may have existed in previous historical periods. Similar practices have been documented in the histories of India, China and Egypt. Reflexology was introduced to the United States in 1913 by William H. Fitzgerald, M.D. (1872–1942), an ear, nose, and throat specialist, and Edwin F. Bowers. Fitzgerald claimed that applying pressure had an anesthetic effect on other areas of the body. It was modified in the 1930s and 1940s by Eunice D. Ingham (1889–1974), a nurse and physiotherapist. Ingham claimed that the feet and hands were especially sensitive and mapped the entire body into &quot;reflexes&quot; on the feet, renaming &quot;zone therapy&quot; as reflexology. Many of the modern reflexologists use Ingham&#x27;s methods, or similar techniques of reflexologist Laura Norman.

==Effectiveness==
In 2015, the Australian Government&#x27;s Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance. Reflexology was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. Accordingly, in 2017, the Australian government named reflexology as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would &quot;ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence&quot;.

Reviews from 2009 and 2011 have found no evidence sufficient to support the use of reflexology for any medical condition. A 2009 systematic review of randomized controlled trials concludes: &quot;The best evidence available to date does not demonstrate convincingly that reflexology is an effective treatment for any medical condition.&quot;

There is no clinical evidence that reflexology is effective to treat cancer. Cancer Research UK have commented that &quot;there is no scientific evidence to prove that reflexology can cure or prevent any type of disease, including cancer&quot;.

==Claimed mechanism==
There is no consensus among reflexologists on how reflexology is supposed to work; a unifying theme is the idea that areas on the foot correspond to areas of the body and that by manipulating these one can improve health through one&#x27;s qi. Reflexologists divide the body into ten equal vertical zones, five on the right and five on the left. Concerns have been raised by medical professionals that treating potentially serious illnesses with reflexology, which has no proven efficacy, could delay the seeking of appropriate medical treatment.

Reflexologists posit that the blockage of an energy field, invisible life force, or Qi, can prevent healing. Another tenet of reflexology is the belief that practitioners can relieve stress and pain in other parts of the body through the manipulation of the feet. One claimed explanation is that the pressure received in the feet may send signals that &#x27;balance&#x27; the nervous system or release chemicals such as endorphins that reduce stress and pain. These hypotheses are rejected by the medical community who cite a lack of scientific evidence and the well-tested germ theory of disease.

Reflexology&#x27;s claim to manipulate energy (Qi) is unsupported by science; there is no scientific evidence for the existence of life energy (Qi), &quot;energy balance&quot;, &quot;crystalline structures&quot; or &quot;pathways&quot; in the body.

In &quot;Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial&quot;, Simon Singh states that if indeed the hands and feet &quot;reflect&quot; the internal organs, reflexology might be expected to explain how such &quot;reflection&quot; was derived from the process of Darwinian natural selection, but Singh says that no argument or evidence has been adduced.

==Regulation==
In the United Kingdom, reflexology is coordinated on a voluntary basis by the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC). Registrants are required to meet Standards of Proficiency outlined by Profession Specific Boards but since CNHC is voluntary anyone practicing can describe themselves as a reflexologist. When the CNHC began admitting reflexologists, a skeptic searched for, and found, 14 of them who were claiming efficacy on illnesses. Once pointed out, the CNHC had the claims retracted as it conflicted with the UK&#x27;s Advertising Standards Authority code.

Reflexology is one of the most used alternative therapies in Denmark. A national survey from 2005 showed that 21.4% of the Danish population had used reflexology at some point and 6.1% had used reflexology within the previous year. A study from Norway showed that 5.6% of the Norwegian population in 2007 had used reflexology within the last 12 months.

<text>Computer-aided engineering (CAE) is the general usage of technology to aid in tasks related to engineering analysis. Any use of technology to solve or assist engineering issues falls under this umbrella. 

== Overview ==
Following alongside the consistent improvement in computer graphics and speed, computer aid assists engineers with once complicated and time consuming tasks with the input of information and a press of a button. 

It includes finite element method or analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), multibody dynamics (MBD), durability and optimization. It is included with computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) in a collective term and abbreviation computer-aided technologies (CAx).

The term CAE has been used to describe the use of computer technology within engineering in a broader sense than just engineering analysis. It was in this context that the term was coined by Jason Lemon, founder of Structural Dynamics Research Corporation (SDRC) in the late 1970s. However, this definition is better known today by the terms CAx and product lifecycle management (PLM).

CAE systems are individually considered a single node on a total information network and each node may interact with other nodes on the network.

== CAE fields and phases ==
CAE areas covered include:
*Stress analysis on components and assemblies using finite element analysis (FEA);
*Thermal and fluid flow analysis computational fluid dynamics (CFD);
*Multibody dynamics (MBD) and kinematics;
*Analysis tools for process simulation for operations such as casting, molding, and die press forming;
*Optimization of the product or process.

In general, there are three phases in any computer-aided engineering task:
*Pre-processing – defining the model and environmental factors to be applied to it (typically a finite element model, but facet, voxel, and thin sheet methods are also used);
*Analysis solver (usually performed on high powered computers);
*Post-processing of results (using visualization tools).

This cycle is iterated, often many times, either manually or with the use of commercial optimization software.

==CAE in the automotive industry==
CAE tools are widely used in the automotive industry. Their use has enabled automakers to reduce product development costs and time while improving the safety, comfort, and durability of the vehicles they produce. The predictive capability of CAE tools has progressed to the point where much of the design verification is done using computer simulations (diagnosis) rather than physical prototype testing. CAE dependability is based upon all proper assumptions as inputs and must identify critical inputs (BJ). Even though there have been many advances in CAE, and it is widely used in the engineering field, physical testing is still a must. It is used for verification and model updating, to accurately define loads and boundary conditions, and for final prototype sign-off.

==The future of CAE in the product development process==
Even though CAE has built a strong reputation as a verification, troubleshooting and analysis tool, there is still a perception that sufficiently accurate results come rather late in the design cycle to really drive the design. This can be expected to become a problem as modern products become ever more complex. They include smart systems, which leads to an increased need for multi-physics analysis including controls, and contain new lightweight materials, with which engineers are often less familiar. 
CAE software companies and manufacturers are constantly looking for tools and process improvements to change this situation. 

On the software side, they are constantly looking to develop more powerful solvers, to better utilize computer resources, and to include engineering knowledge in pre and post-processing. On the process side, they try to achieve a better alignment between 3D CAE, 1D system simulation, and physical testing. This should increase modeling realism and calculation speed. 

CAE software companies and manufacturers try to better integrate CAE in the overall product lifecycle management. In this way they can connect product design with product use, which is needed for smart products. This enhanced engineering process is also referred to as predictive engineering analytics.

<text>Baron de Clifford is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1299 for Robert de Clifford (&quot;c.&quot;1274–1314), feudal baron of Clifford in Herefordshire, feudal baron of Skipton in Yorkshire and feudal baron of Appleby in Westmoreland. The title was created by writ, which means that it can descend through both male and female lines. The Norman family which later took the name &quot;de Clifford&quot; settled in England after the Norman Conquest of 1066 and was first seated in England at Clifford Castle in Herefordshire. The first Baron served as Earl Marshal of England but was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. His 8th generation descendant the 11th Baron, was created Earl of Cumberland in 1525, whose grandson the 3rd Earl was a noted naval commander. On the latter&#x27;s death in 1605, the earldom passed to his younger brother, the 4th Earl (see the Earl of Cumberland for later history of this title).
The barony of de Clifford was claimed in 1628 by his daughter and only child, Lady Anne Clifford, but the House of Lords postponed the hearing. The barony remained dormant until 1678, when Nicholas Tufton, 3rd Earl of Thanet, was allowed to claim the peerage and became the fifteenth Baron de Clifford. He was the son of Lady Margaret Sackville, daughter of the aforementioned Anne Clifford. On the death of the Earl&#x27;s younger brother, the sixth Earl, in 1721, the earldom and barony separated. The earldom was inherited by the late Earl&#x27;s nephew, the seventh Earl (see the Earl of Thanet for further information on this title).

The barony fell into abeyance between the Earl&#x27;s five daughters, Lady Katherine, Lady Anne, Lady Isabel, Lady Margaret and Lady Mary. It remained in abeyance until 1734 when the abeyance was terminated in favour of the third daughter, Margaret, who became the nineteenth Baroness. She was the wife of Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester. On her death in 1775, the title again fell into abeyance, this time between her sisters and their heirs. The abeyance was terminated only a year later in favour of Edward Southwell, the 20th Baron. He was the grandson of Lady Catherine Tufton, eldest daughter of the sixth Earl of Thanet. He was succeeded by his son, the 21st Baron. He was childless and on his death in 1832, the barony fell into abeyance between his sisters Hon. Sophia Southwell and Hon. Elizabeth Southwell and the heirs of his deceased sister Hon. Catherine Southwell.

The peerage was called out of abeyance in 1833 in favour of Sophia Coussmaker, the twenty-second holder. She was the only surviving child of Hon. Catherine Southwell and her husband George Coussmaker. The 22nd baroness was the wife of John Russell, third son of Lord William Russell, third son of Francis Russell, Marquess of Tavistock, eldest son and heir of John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford. She was succeeded by her son, the 23rd Baron, Liberal Member of Parliament for Tavistock.

In 1935 Edward Russell, 26th Baron de Clifford became the last peer to be tried in the House of Lords for a felony, manslaughter, the result of a car accident. He was found not guilty. , the title is held by his grandson Miles Russell, 28th Baron de Clifford.

Other members of the Clifford family have been created barons, namely as Baron Clifford (created 1628, in abeyance since 1858) and Baron Clifford of Chudleigh (created 1672), which title is extant and which family is the senior surviving branch of the Norman de Clifford family of Clifford Castle. Members of the family have also been created baronets as Baronet Clifford of Flaxbourne, New Zealand, Baronet Clifford of the Navy and Baronet Clifford-Constable of Tixall, Staffordshire.

<text>A test screening, or test audience, is a preview screening of a film or television series before its general release to gauge audience reaction. Preview audiences are selected from a cross-section of the population and are usually asked to complete a questionnaire or provide feedback in some form. Harold Lloyd is credited with inventing the concept, having used it as early as 1928. Test screenings have been recommended for starting filmmakers &quot;even if a film festival is fast approaching&quot;.

==Notable examples and outcomes of test screenings==

In 2004, Roger Ebert, the late reviewer for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, wrote that test screenings by filmmakers are &quot;valid&quot; to get an idea of an audience response to a rough cut. But &quot;too often, however, studio executives use preview screenings as a weapon to enforce their views on directors, and countless movies have had stupid happy endings tacked on after such screenings.&quot; Ebert writes that Billy Wilder dropped the first reel from &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; after a test screening. Producer Tim Bevan emphasizes that the goal of the film editing process is to turn unedited film &quot;into 85 to 110 minutes of story that people are going to want to go and see&quot;, and he &quot;absolutely believes in the testing process. 99.9 times out of 100 the audience will speak louder than anybody else&quot;. Even though &quot;editing rooms can be very combative places&quot; with directors, the test results make the process &quot;less combative.&quot; While filming &quot;Johnny English&quot; (2003) with director Peter Howitt, testing led to reshoots of the beginning of the film to set up the character better, and &quot;test scores leaped considerably.&quot;

Edgar Wright, writer and director of &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, said in an interview that in test screenings done before the film&#x27;s special effects were completed, audiences remarked that the ending was &quot;a bit abrupt&quot; and &quot;lame&quot;. After being given a low budget and two days to finish shooting, the filmmakers added a &quot;15 second&quot; ending, which follow-up press screening audiences liked, leading to one reviewer changing his earlier bad review, giving &quot;an extra star&quot;. Dan Myrick and Ed Sanchez, directors of &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; said, &quot;We had a hour cut [...] We had no idea what we had, so we had to show it to an audience and get their reaction.&quot; At this screening, the filmmakers met their future producer.

Feedback from a test screening may be used to alter the movie before it is released. This may be as simple as changing the title of the film (as in the case of the film that became &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;), or it may be more substantial. Cases exist of where test screenings prompted filmmakers to completely change the ending of a movie (by having a character die who would have survived, or vice versa, for instance); examples include &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;Final Destination&quot;, &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;, &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;, &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;. Test screenings showed negative audience reactions to onscreen kissing between Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts (in &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;); the test response to his onscreen kiss with Mimi Rogers (in &quot;The Mighty Quinn&quot;) led to the scene being cut. Director John Carpenter has been quoted as saying &quot;We&#x27;ve just had a test screening, and the upshot is we&#x27;re throwing out the first reel, and starting with reel two.&quot; during the pre-dubbing for &quot;Escape from New York.&quot;

In a test screening for the Harrison Ford spy thriller &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;, the audience started to applaud during the main villain&#x27;s climactic death scene, but &quot;it was over before they could&quot;; this resulted in reshoots. According to the director, Phillip Noyce, screening a trimmed-down version of the film for test audiences resulted in &quot;more people thinking it was longer, than when it was long&quot;, supporting the studio&#x27;s insistence on a 142-minute version.

Different test audiences can produce startlingly different results. After agreeing on what they thought would be a final &quot;lean and mean&quot; cut, and validating it with a test audience, producer/screenwriter Chris Jones and director Genevieve Jolliffe, of &quot;Urban Ghost Story&quot;, presented a test screening for some &quot;industry people&quot;, who declared the film &quot;too slow.&quot; This result caused the two filmmakers to argue extensively between themselves, but they tried cutting 15 minutes from the first 25, the &quot;baggy&quot; part. Jones relates that the results left them with &quot;our jaws on the floor, saying &#x27;why on earth did we leave all that junk in?&#x27;&quot;

According to a June 2008 article from &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Two weeks before the release of &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; (2004), director Paul Greengrass got together with its star, Matt Damon, came up with a new ending and phoned the producers saying the new idea was &quot;way&quot; better, it would cost $200,000 and involve pulling Damon from the set of &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 12&quot; for a re-shoot. Reluctantly the producers agreed—the movie tested 10 points higher with the new ending&quot;.

During test screenings of Wolfgang Petersen&#x27;s &quot;Troy&quot;, test audiences reacted negatively to the film. The producers reported that audiences listed Gabriel Yared&#x27;s unfinished score as a factor, calling it &quot;too brassy and bold&quot; and &quot;too old fashioned&quot;. On the screening prints, Yared&#x27;s score had lacked the intended choir parts to balance the &quot;brassy&quot; parts. The filmmakers sought a replacement composer before informing Yared of his firing, and asked James Horner to write a new score in two weeks. In later reviews, several film score critics describe Yared&#x27;s score as superior to Horner&#x27;s.

Director Ridley Scott &quot;snuck in&quot; to the first test screening of &quot;American Gangster&quot; and stayed because &quot;no one moved&quot; in the audience, indicating that they were &quot;fully engaged&quot;. Some screenings are intended only to determine how best to market a film; director Kevin Smith writes that he &quot;hates&quot; test screenings, and &quot;doesn&#x27;t know any filmmaker&quot; who enjoys the process, but describes a very good audience response and focus group in Kansas City, MO at the sole marketing test screening for &quot;Clerks II&quot;.

In television, test screenings may be used before a series debuts, to help fine-tune the concept (as with &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, leading to the Muppets appearing onscreen with human characters, rather than in separate segments), or to pre-test specific episodes.

Adam West in his book &quot;Back to the Batcave&quot; stated that test screenings for the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; television series incorporated audience-controlled dials monitored by computer. Shown to about one hundred recruited audience members, the pilot episode received &quot;the worst score in the history of pilot testing&quot;, in the &quot;high 40s&quot;, where the average pilot score was in the mid-60s. Several adjustments were made to the show and retested, including a laugh track, then narration; the test results were the same. The decision was made to add &quot;huge new special effects gags that would look great in promos.&quot;

Wes Craven&#x27;s film &quot;Deadly Friend&quot; had a test screening by Warner Bros. that was set up for audiences mostly consisting of Craven&#x27;s fans, as he had a large fan base after the critical and commercial success of his previous theatrically released film, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;. The audience reaction was overwhelmingly negative, criticizing the lack of graphic violence and gore that was shown in Craven&#x27;s previous films. Warner Bros. eventually discovered Craven&#x27;s fan base and forced writer Bruce Joel Rubin to write six additional splatter sequences into his script. Craven and Rubin virtually disowned the film by that point.

During post-production of Carlo Carlei&#x27;s 2013 adaptation of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, test screening audiences disliked the film, and cited James Horner&#x27;s score as one of its weaknesses. After the film&#x27;s producers argued with Carlei about replacing the score, they commissioned Abel Korzeniowski to write a replacement score. The film was once again screened, with one version having Horner&#x27;s score, the other having Korzeniowski&#x27;s new score. The producers then chose to reject Horner&#x27;s score because the screening with Korzeniowski&#x27;s score had gotten higher ratings from the audience.

<text>Herbert Czaja (November 5, 1914 – April 18, 1997) was a German Christian democratic politician. Czaja was born to a multi-ethnic and multilingual family in Cieszyn in Poland, which was part of Austria-Hungary at the time of his birth. During the Second Polish Republic he was politically active in the German Christian People&#x27;s Party, a centrist party representing German-speaking Catholics in Poland, and obtained a doctorate in philology from the Jagiellonian University. In 1946 he was expelled from his native Poland by the communist regime during the expulsion of Germans after World War II and came as a refugee to Stuttgart in West Germany, where he worked as a teacher and became active in politics for the Christian Democratic Union.

He served as a member of the city council of Stuttgart from 1947 to 1953, as a member of the Bundestag from 1953 to 1990, was a long-time member of the Central Committee of German Catholics from 1948, and was President of the Federation of Expellees from 1970 to 1994. His political activity focused both on the refugees from Eastern Europe and on Catholic affairs. In the official propaganda of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, Czaja was portrayed as one of West Germany&#x27;s most important politicians and his influence often exaggerated. After the Cold War, Czaja was involved in Polish-German reconciliation efforts. He was awarded the Knight Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1984.

== Early life in Austria-Hungary and Poland ==

Herbert Czaja was born in Teschen (Cieszyn) in Austria-Hungary to a bilingual family of Polish, Czech and German origin. Cieszyn was a typically multi-ethnic city where many had both Polish and German (Austrian) roots. His father Albert Czaja was a respected notary who was fluent in Polish, German and Czech; his mother was Louise née Smekal. His father&#x27;s name Czaja is Polish, while his mother&#x27;s name Smekal is of Czech origin. Herbert Czaja became a Polish citizen at age four when his hometown became part of the Second Polish Republic. He was fluent in Polish and German.

Czaja studied German studies, history, and philosophy in Vienna and Kraków. Influenced by his bilingual family and upbringing, he became interested in minority issues, and during the 1930s, he was active in German student organisations in the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship of Poland, as a member of Senator Eduard Pant&#x27;s German Christian People&#x27;s Party, a Catholic party working for the interests of the German minority in Poland. In 1937, he joined the German Association for the National Pacification of Europe, an anti-Nazi group in Poland founded by Eduard Pant. At the same time, he worked as a teacher in eastern Upper Silesia. In 1939, before the start of World War II, he received his doctorate in German literature at the Jagiellonian University with the dissertation &quot;Stefan Georges Ringen um autonomes Menschentum&quot; (&quot;The struggle of Stefan George for autonomous humanity&quot;). His doctoral advisor was Adam Kleczkowski, one of Poland&#x27;s most respected German studies scholars. He then briefly worked as a scientific assistant at the Jagiellonian University.

During World War II, when his hometown was annexed by Germany, he was considered part of the ethnic German community by the German authorities. From October 1940 to March 1941 Czaja worked as a secondary school teacher in Zakopane and then from March 1941 to May 1942 in Przemyśl. He continued to be involved in anti-Nazi activities, but fearing prosecution for treason and upon the advice of a friend, he volunteered for the Wehrmacht in 1942 to get away from Silesia, serving until he was severely wounded in early 1945.

==Expulsion from Poland==
When Czaja returned to Cieszyn, his parents&#x27; home had been destroyed, communists had taken control over Poland and the situation of ethnic Germans in Silesia was dire. The boundaries between Germans and Poles were blurry in multi-ethnic families like the Czajas, and Czaja appears to initially have been considered Polish upon his return to his hometown. Czaja&#x27;s mentor and doctoral advisor Adam Kleczkowski offered him a position at the Jagiellonian University to undertake a Habilitation, but Czaja would be required to declare Polish nationality. Under the circumstances of ethnic persecution of the group he felt most attached to and a communist dictatorship now in place in Poland, Czaja was unwilling to declare Polish nationality. Shortly after in 1946, Czaja was expelled by the Polish People&#x27;s Republic authorities during the expulsion of Germans after World War II.

==Political career in West Germany==

Herbert Czaja settled in Stuttgart, where he immediately became involved in politics for the Christian Democratic Union and its youth wing, the Junge Union.

He was a member of the city council of Stuttgart from 1947 to 1953. He also co-founded the Union of Expellees in the CDU and chaired the branch in Northern Württemberg. In 1948 he was elected a member of the Central Committee of German Catholics, an office he held for decades. His political career in West Germany focused equally on refugee affairs and on Catholic issues. He was also a central member of the Ackermann Community, a Catholic organisation promoting ties between Germans and Czechs.

He served as a member of the Bundestag, the Parliament of West Germany, from 1953 to 1990. During this time he represented Stuttgart-Nord from 1983 to 1990. He also served as spokesman of the Landsmannschaft der Oberschlesier from 1969 and was president of the Federation of Expellees (&quot;Bund der Vertriebenen&quot;, BdV) from 1970 to 1994.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Czaja voted, along with several conservative politicians, against the recognition of the Oder-Neisse line as the Polish-German definitive border. Also in 1990, he argued that the reunification of the Federal Republic of Germany with the territory of the former German Democratic Republic was not a complete reunification according to the German constitution of 1949, as it did not include the eastern provinces of Germany as of 1937. Czaja proposed to establish out of Western Poland an autonomous zone under international administration.

During the Cold War, Herbert Czaja figured prominently in the official state propaganda of the communist regime of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, and was often portrayed as an enemy of the state. His influence in West German politics was often exaggerated by the Polish communists.

After the end of the Cold War, he was active in Polish-German reconciliation efforts in the 1990s, and worked as an adviser for the authorities of Opole Voivodeship in modern Poland. While promoting ethnic peace between Poles and Germans, he maintained that the historically eastern German provinces could in the future be reunited with Germany, as he repeated in his 1996 book &quot;Unterwegs zum kleinsten Deutschland?&quot; Czaja however stated that no expulsions may ever be repeated; that millions of Poles had lived in a German state before and could so once again if these lands would be reintegrated into Germany. Czaja explicitly called for a Centre against Expulsions in Berlin to be established by Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic in a joint effort to promote peace and reconciliation.

==Family==
Czaja died in Stuttgart in 1997, survived by a wife and ten children. His oldest daughter, Christine Maria Czaja, published a biography of her father in 2003, titled &quot;Herbert Czaja: Anwalt für Menschenrechte&quot; (Herbert Czaja: Advocate for Human Rights).

==Honours==
Herbert Czaja was awarded the Officer&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1968. He was awarded the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the same order in 1973 and the Knight Commander&#x27;s Cross in 1984. He was awarded the Medal of Merit of Baden-Württemberg in 1988. A street in Stuttgart, Dr.-Herbert–Czaja-Weg, was named in his honour in 2002.

<text>Willis Eugene Lamb Jr. (; July 12, 1913 – May 15, 2008) was an American physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1955 &quot;for his discoveries concerning the fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum.&quot; The Nobel Committee that year awarded half the prize to Lamb and the other half to Polykarp Kusch, who won &quot;for his precision determination of the magnetic moment of the electron.&quot; Lamb was able to precisely determine a surprising shift in electron energies in a hydrogen atom (see Lamb shift). Lamb was a professor at the University of Arizona College of Optical Sciences.

==Biography==
Lamb was born in Los Angeles, California, United States and attended Los Angeles High School. First admitted in 1930, he received a Bachelor of Science in chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley in 1934. For theoretical work on scattering of neutrons by a crystal, guided by J. Robert Oppenheimer, he received the Ph.D. in physics in 1938. Because of limited computational methods available at the time, this research narrowly missed revealing the Mössbauer Effect, 19 years before its recognition by Mössbauer. He worked on nuclear theory, laser physics, and verifying quantum mechanics.

Lamb was a physics professor at Stanford from 1951 to 1956. Lamb was the Wykeham Professor of Physics at the University of Oxford from 1956 to 1962, and also taught at Yale, Columbia and the University of Arizona. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963. In 2000, The Optical Society elected him an Honorary member.

Lamb is remembered as a &quot;rare theorist turned experimentalist&quot; by D. Kaiser.

==Quantum physics==

In addition to his crucial and famous contribution to quantum electrodynamics via the Lamb shift, in the latter part of his career he paid increasing attention to the field of quantum measurements. In one of his writings Lamb stated that &quot;most people who use quantum mechanics have little need to know much about the interpretation of the subject.&quot; Lamb was also openly critical of many of the interpretational trends on quantum mechanics and of the use of the term photon.

==Personal==
In 1939 Lamb married his first wife, Ursula Schäfer, a German student, who became a distinguished historian of Latin America (and assumed his last name). After her death in 1996, he married physicist Bruria Kaufman in 1996, whom he later divorced. In 2008 he married Elsie Wattson.

Lamb died on May 15, 2008, at the age of 94, due to complications of a gallstone disorder.

<text>Baron Willoughby de Eresby ( ) is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1313 for Robert de Willoughby. Since 1983, the title has been held by Jane Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 28th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby.

==History==
The title of Baron Willoughby was created by writ in 1313 for Robert de Willoughby, lord of the manor of Eresby in the parish of Spilsby, Lincolnshire. He was the son of Sir William de Willoughby and Alice, daughter of John Beke, 1st Baron Beke of Eresby. The writ was addressed to &quot;Roberto de Wylghby&quot;, and the suffix of de Eresby was added to the title between 1350 and 1360 to distinguish it from other members of the de Willoughby family.

The fourteenth Baron was created Earl of Lindsey in 1626. His great-grandson, the fourth Earl and seventeenth Baron, was created Marquess of Lindsey in 1706 and Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven in 1715. On the death of the first Duke&#x27;s great-grandson, the fourth Duke, the Dukedom, Marquessate and Earldom were inherited by his uncle, while the Barony of Willoughby de Eresby fell into abeyance between the late Duke&#x27;s sisters Lady Priscilla and Lady Georgiana. In 1780, the title was called out of abeyance in favour of Priscilla. She was the wife of Peter Burrell, 1st Baron Gwydyr. Their son Peter inherited both Baronies. On the death of Peter&#x27;s only son Albyric, the Barony of Gwydyr was passed on to a cousin, while the Barony of Willoughby de Eresby fell into abeyance between his sisters Clementina Drummond-Willoughby, wife of Gilbert John Heathcote, 1st Baron Aveland and Charlotte, wife of Robert Carrington, 2nd Baron Carrington. In 1871 the abeyance was terminated in favour of Clementina. She was succeeded by her and Lord Aveland&#x27;s son Gilbert, 2nd Baron Aveland and 25th Baron Willoughby de Eresby. In 1892 he was created Earl of Ancaster, a revival of the Ancaster title created for his maternal ancestor in 1715. On the death of his grandson, the third Earl, in 1983, the Earldom and Barony of Aveland became extinct (while the Baronetcy also held by the Earl was passed on to a distant relative), while the Barony of Willoughby de Eresby was inherited by the late Earl&#x27;s daughter, Nancy, the present holder of the title.

Since 1626, the Barony of Willoughby de Eresby has been associated with office of Lord Great Chamberlain. In that year, the first Earl of Lindsey inherited the Great Chamberlainship. Upon the death of the fourth Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven, it was divided between his sisters Priscilla and Georgiana (who was later Marchioness of Cholmondeley). Thereafter, the barony of Willoughby de Eresby has been associated with the senior share of the Lord Great Chamberlainship. However, it has not been associated with the highest share. The share belonging to Lady Cholmondeley has been passed intact to her heirs, the Marquesses of Cholmondeley, but Lady Willoughby de Eresby&#x27;s share has been split between many heirs. As of 2004, only one-fourth of the Lord Great Chamberlainship is possessed by the holder of the barony.

The peerage has been held by a woman six times, more than any other peerage except that of Baron de Ros.

The family seats are Grimsthorpe Castle in Edenham, near Bourne, Lincolnshire and Drummond Castle, near Crieff, Perthshire, Scotland, originally the family seat of the Drummond earls of Perth. Both are managed by the Grimsthorpe and Drummond Castle Trust.

<text>In the C programming language, Duff&#x27;s device is a way of manually implementing loop unrolling by interleaving two syntactic constructs of C: the - loop and a switch statement. Its discovery is credited to Tom Duff in November 1983, when Duff was working for Lucasfilm and used it to speed up a real-time animation program.

Loop unrolling attempts to reduce the overhead of conditional branching needed to check whether a loop is done, by executing a batch of loop bodies per iteration. To handle cases where the number of iterations is not divisible by the unrolled-loop increments, a common technique among assembly language programmers is to jump directly into the middle of the unrolled loop body to handle the remainder.
Duff implemented this technique in C by using C&#x27;s case label fall-through feature to jump into the unrolled body.

==Original version==
Duff&#x27;s problem was to copy 16-bit unsigned integers (&quot;shorts&quot; in most C implementations) from an array into a memory-mapped output register, denoted in C by a pointer. His original code, in C, looked as follows:
send(to, from, count)
register short *to, *from;
register count;
 do { /* count &gt; 0 assumed */
 *to = *from++;
 } while (--count &gt; 0);


This code assumes that initial . Since the output location is a memory-mapped register, the pointer is not incremented as would be required for a memory-to-memory copy.

If were always divisible by eight, unrolling this loop eight-fold would produce the following:
send(to, from, count)
register short *to, *from;
register count;
 register n = count / 8;
 do {
 *to = *from++;
 *to = *from++;
 *to = *from++;
 *to = *from++;
 *to = *from++;
 *to = *from++;
 *to = *from++;
 *to = *from++;
 } while (--n &gt; 0);


Duff realized that to handle cases where is not divisible by eight, the assembly programmer&#x27;s technique of jumping into the loop body could be implemented by interlacing the structures of a switch statement and a loop, putting the switch&#x27;s labels at the points of the loop body that correspond to the remainder of :
send(to, from, count)
register short *to, *from;
register count;
 register n = (count + 7) / 8;
 switch (count % 8) {
 case 0: do { *to = *from++;
 case 7: *to = *from++;
 case 6: *to = *from++;
 case 5: *to = *from++;
 case 4: *to = *from++;
 case 3: *to = *from++;
 case 2: *to = *from++;
 case 1: *to = *from++;
 } while (--n &gt; 0);
}
Duff&#x27;s device can be applied with any size for the unrolled loop, not just eight as in the example above.

==Mechanism==
Based on an algorithm used widely by programmers coding in assembly for minimizing the number of tests and branches during a copy, Duff&#x27;s device appears out of place when implemented in C. The device is valid C by virtue of two attributes in C:
# Relaxed specification of the statement in the language&#x27;s definition. At the time of the device&#x27;s invention this was the first edition of &quot;The C Programming Language&quot; which requires only that the body of the be a syntactically valid (compound) statement within which labels can appear prefixing any sub-statement. In conjunction with the fact that, in the absence of a statement, the flow of control will &quot;fall through&quot; from a statement controlled by one label to that controlled by the next, this means that the code specifies a succession of copies from sequential source addresses to the memory-mapped output port.
# The ability to jump into the middle of a loop in C.

This leads to what the &quot;Jargon File&quot; calls &quot;the most dramatic use yet seen of fall through in C&quot;. C&#x27;s default fall-through in case statements has long been one of its most controversial features; Duff himself said that &quot;This code forms some sort of argument in that debate, but I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s for or against.&quot;

Although valid in C, Duff&#x27;s device goes against common C guidelines, such as the MISRA guidelines. Some compilers (e.g. CompCert) are restricted to such guidelines and thus reject Duff&#x27;s device unless specifically instructed otherwise.

==Simplified explanation==
The basic idea of loop unrolling is that the number of instructions executed in a loop can be reduced by reducing the number of loop tests, sometimes reducing the amount of time spent in the loop. For example, in the case of a loop with only a single instruction in the block code, the loop test will typically be performed for every iteration of the loop, that is every time the instruction is executed. If, instead, eight copies of the same instruction are placed in the loop, then the test will be performed only every eight iterations, and this may gain time by avoiding seven tests. However, this only handles a multiple of eight iterations, requiring something else to handle any remainder of iterations.

Duff&#x27;s device provides a solution by first performing the remainder of iterations, followed by iterating as many times as necessary the multiple of eight similar instructions. To determine the number of remainder iterations, the code first calculates the total number of iterations modulo eight. According to this remainder, the program execution will then &quot;jump&quot; to a codice_1 statement followed by &quot;exactly the number of iterations needed&quot;. Once this is done, everything is straightforward: the code continues by doing iterations of groups of eight instructions; this has become possible since the remaining number of iterations is a multiple of eight.

Duff&#x27;s device provides a compact loop unrolling by using the case keyword &quot;both inside and outside the loop&quot;. This is unusual because the contents of a case statement are traditionally thought of as a block of code nested inside the case statement, and a reader would typically expect it to end before the next case statement. According to the specifications of C language, this is not necessary; indeed, case statements can appear anywhere inside the switch code block, and at any depth; the program execution will simply jump to the next statement, wherever it may be.

==Performance==
Many compilers will optimize the switch into a branch table just as would be done in an assembly implementation.

The primary increase in speed versus a simple, straightforward loop, comes from loop unwinding that reduces the number of performed branches, which are computationally expensive due to the need to flushand hence stallthe instruction pipeline. The codice_2 statement is used to handle the remainder of the data not evenly divisible by the number of operations unrolled (in this example, eight short moves are unrolled, so the codice_2 handles an extra 1–7 shorts automatically).

This automatic handling of the remainder may not be the best solution on all systems and compilers in some cases two loops may actually be faster (one loop, unrolled, to do the main copy, and a second loop to handle the remainder). The problem appears to come down to the ability of the compiler to correctly optimize the device; it may also interfere with pipelining and branch prediction on some architectures. When numerous instances of Duff&#x27;s device were removed from the XFree86 Server in version 4.0, there was an improvement in performance and a noticeable reduction in size of the executable.&lt;ref name=&quot;lkml-0008.2/0171&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, before applying any program optimization, it should be benchmarked or its compiled output should be explored, to verify that it performs as expected on the target architecture, optimization level, and compiler. Additionally, the risk of the optimized code deployed on different platforms where it may not remain the fastest option should be considered.

For the purpose of memory-to-memory copies (which, as mentioned above, was not the original use of Duff&#x27;s device), the standard C library provides the function codice_4; it will not perform worse than a memory-to-memory copy version of this code, and may contain architecture-specific optimizations that make it significantly faster.

<text>The Convention of the Hungarian Baptist Churches of Romania (; ) is a Baptist Christian association of Hungarian churches in Romania within the larger Baptist Union of Romania, united for promoting cooperative ministry. The convention operates as a &quot;sister&quot; denomination to the Baptist Union of Romania and is a member of the European Baptist Federation and the Baptist World Alliance. 

==History==
In the 1870s Anton Novak, an Ethnic German colporteur of the British and Foreign Bible Society, began to meet and study the Scriptures with a group of Reformed Christians in Transylvania. In 1875, Heinrich Meyer baptized eight of them and formed them into a church in Salonta Mare. This was the first Baptist church in Transylvania.

The Baptist Union of Romania was formed in 1920, but Saxons, Hungarians, and Rusyn-Ukrainians maintained associations to promote their own interests. The &quot;Recognized Hungarian Baptist Union of Romania&quot; was founded at Salonta in October 1920. The &quot;Unrecognized Hungarian Baptist Union of Romania&quot; was formed around the same time in Nuşfalău. In 1922, the &quot;Recognized Hungarian Baptist Union&quot; associated with the &quot;Baptist Union of Romania&quot; as a department within it, and also joined the Baptist World Alliance. The two Hungarian Baptist groups united to become the &quot;Hungarian Baptist Convention of Romania&quot; in 1935.

Government instability and change brought varying challenges to the Baptists of Romania, especially from 1955 to 1989, under the Communist regime. During this time believers were harassed, churches closed, ministers threatened, and educational work prohibited. In 1948, the &quot;Hungarian Baptist Convention&quot; was closed. The &quot;Union of the Hungarian Baptist Churches of Romania&quot; was organized in Cluj-Napoca on February 3, 1990. In 1996, the name &quot;Union&quot; was changed to &quot;Convention&quot;.

According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 8,321 members in 253 churches.

<text>Charles &quot;Trip&quot; Tucker III, portrayed by Connor Trinneer, is a fictional character in the television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;.

Tucker was the chief engineer on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and also briefly served in the same role aboard at the Enterprise&#x27;s sister ship &quot;Columbia&quot;.

==Biography==
Tucker was born in 2121. His nickname &quot;Trip&quot; is short for &quot;Triple&quot;, as he is the third generation of his family to be named Charles Tucker. He joined the United Earth Starfleet in 2139 and first met Jonathan Archer around 2143, a decade prior to the launch of &quot;Enterprise,&quot; when the two worked together on an early warp 2 prototype vessel using the warp engine designed by Archer&#x27;s father, Henry Archer.

While a knowledgeable engineer, Tucker can be rash and &quot;illogical&quot;, an opinion that early on causes friction between &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s Vulcan science officer, T&#x27;Pol, and him. During the first year of &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s mission, he finds himself coping with situations with which no Starfleet engineer has ever coped, and is a key player in the vessel finally achieving maximum speed at warp 5.

Tucker also enjoys occasional romantic relationships, including one with an exotic alien engineer in the episode &quot;Unexpected&quot;. When challenged about these relationships, his stock phrase is, &quot;I was a perfect gentleman&quot;. He is statistically the greatest charmer aboard the &quot;Enterprise,&quot; and he has gone down in &quot;Star Trek&quot; history as the first human male ever to be pregnant and the first human male ever to be in a relationship with a member of another species.

In the last episode of the second season, Earth was attacked by an alien race called the Xindi. The attack was made by a prototype weapon that struck from Florida crossing into Venezuela, over the Caribbean Sea, and caused the deaths of 7 million people, including Tucker&#x27;s sister. This left Tucker emotionally scarred and unable to sleep without experiencing vivid nightmares. At the request of Dr. Phlox, Tucker agreed to undergo Vulcan neuropressure treatments with T&#x27;Pol. Although the treatments required very intimate contact between the two, no signs were seen at first of anything beyond a professional relationship developing between the officers.

At a crucial point during the Xindi mission, Tucker suffered a potentially fatal injury, and the only way to save his life was to create a clone to harvest needed brain cells. The clone, named &quot;Sim&quot;, grew to adulthood over only a few days, and many of the crew became fond of him, in particular T&#x27;Pol, who actually kissed Sim after he confessed to being attracted to T&#x27;Pol — but adding that he was uncertain whether those feelings were his own or Tucker&#x27;s. Against Sim&#x27;s objections, Archer ordered him to undergo the medical procedure to extract the needed cells to save Tucker&#x27;s life, though this proved fatal to Sim.

As the Xindi mission progressed, Tucker found himself growing closer to T&#x27;Pol, and the two briefly became lovers, an event T&#x27;Pol later dismissed as an experiment, although the real cause was a side effect of her addiction to the substance Trellium D, which affected her emotional judgment.

Tucker admitted to T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s mother he was in love with her daughter during a trip to Vulcan with her after the Xindi mission, during which she decided to marry her fiancé Koss in an arranged marriage. Although T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s mother encouraged Tucker to express his feelings to her daughter, he chose not to do so. Later, following the dissolution of T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s marriage, Tucker considered becoming involved with her again; however. In the episode &quot;Observer Effect&quot;, T&#x27;Pol expressed great concern for Tucker, suggesting her feelings for him remained strong, despite her claims to the contrary.

In 2154, during a mission to prevent a Romulan automated marauder from starting a war, Tucker determined that his attraction to T&#x27;Pol was negatively affecting his ability to do his job. After the mission, he requested, and received, a transfer to the new NX Class starship, &quot;Columbia&quot;.

During this period, Tucker began experiencing vivid daydreams involving T&#x27;Pol, without understanding that she was actually unintentionally communicating with him via mental telepathy when she attempted to meditate. In the episode &quot;Bound&quot;, it was revealed that Tucker and T&#x27;Pol had become psychically bonded when they had made love a year earlier, although this link apparently did not manifest itself right away.

During the events of the episode &quot;Divergence&quot;, Tucker was temporarily reassigned to &quot;Enterprise&quot; to facilitate repairs following a run-in with the Klingons. He subsequently submitted a request to Archer return to &quot;Enterprise&quot; full-time.

Tucker served as &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s chief engineer for a full decade, and prepared to transfer to one of the newly built warp 7-capable starships following the decommissioning of &quot;Enterprise&quot; in 2161, which was to coincide with the signing of the Federation Charter. The series finale &quot;These Are the Voyages...&quot; revealed that Tucker and T&#x27;Pol ended their romantic relationship at some point after the events of &quot;Terra Prime&quot;, for reasons as yet unrevealed. Despite this, the two remained close, and Tucker had to reassure T&#x27;Pol that the decommissioning of &quot;Enterprise&quot; and their reassignment to different vessels would not have any bearing on their friendship.

In the last episode, when Shran&#x27;s former associates track down &quot;Enterprise&quot; and board the ship, they demand that Archer take them to Shran, but the captain refuses. The aliens are about to kill Archer, so Trip, thinking fast, tells them that he will take them to Shran. When Archer protests, the aliens knock him out. Trip leads the aliens into what appears to be a harmless utility closet — he tells them it is simply a com station and he is going to get Shran to come to them. Trip tells them he just needs to connect a couple of things, but when he brings a pair of conduits together, a massive explosion erupts, taking out both Trip and the aliens. Trip dies after being fatally wounded. However, what is seen is a holodeck simulation being run by Will Riker. Whether his death is an actual event is not definitively established.

Also, in the Star Trek Enterprise relaunch novels set after &quot;These Are the Voyages...&quot;, it was revealed that Trip&#x27;s death from the explosion was faked so he could join Section 31 to spy on the Romulans, however this has never been solidified as being canon.

==Personal life==
In 2153, Tucker lost his sister, Elizabeth, in the Xindi attack on Earth which destroyed her hometown in southern Florida. In a first-season episode, &quot;Fusion&quot;, he reveals he has a brother with whom he practiced dancing, although he is never seen. His parents survived the attack and later relocated to Mississippi; they are invited to attend the signing of the United Federation of Planets treaty in 2161, and keep their promise to attend even after Tucker&#x27;s death. T&#x27;Pol requests the opportunity to meet them at this occasion, but whether she does is not known.

At least three offspring have — directly or indirectly — been linked to Tucker:
* In 2151, Tucker is accidentally impregnated by a Xyrillian female, but has the unborn fetus transplanted into another Xyrillian before it was born. The offspring is not genetically related to Tucker as Xyrillian reproduction only uses the mother&#x27;s genes. No further information about this offspring has been revealed. (&quot;Unexpected&quot;)
* In an alternate timeline in the episode &quot;E²&quot;, at some point following an incident that sent &quot;Enterprise&quot; back to the year 2037, Tucker and T&#x27;Pol marry and have a son, Lorian, whose fate after the restoration of the timeline has yet to be revealed.
* In 2155, in the episode &quot;Demons&quot;, Tucker learns that he has a six-month-old daughter, the mother apparently being T&#x27;Pol. It is revealed that the daughter was cloned using Tucker and T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s DNA, which was stolen from &quot;Enterprise&quot; by an infiltrator working for Terra Prime. The cloning procedure was improperly executed, however, and the daughter — whom T&#x27;Pol named &quot;Elizabeth&quot; after Tucker&#x27;s sister — dies soon after being rescued. The child&#x27;s death leaves Tucker emotionally devastated as T&#x27;Pol — herself emotionally drained — tries to comfort him.

Trip is knowledgeable about the ancient board game Go, and actually has a Go board in his cabin (he is seen playing the game with the title character of the episode &quot;Cogenitor&quot;)

Trip has a brief romance with princess Kaitamma (played by Padma Lakshmi) from Krios Prime in &quot;Precious Cargo&quot;. They enjoy a passionate one-night stand when the pair find themselves alone on an uninhabited planet. When Trip returns to the Enterprise, and she to her own planet, she invites Trip to come visit her on Krios Prime after she will have become ruler.

Trip and Malcolm Reed become close friends after being stuck together in Shuttlepod 1 for 3 days after they find evidence that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was destroyed (Shuttlepod One).

==Alternate timelines==
In the alternate timeline seen in the episode &quot;Twilight&quot;, Tucker becomes captain of &quot;Enterprise&quot; following the incapacitation of Jonathan Archer and T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s resignation from Starfleet. He is killed when &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s bridge is destroyed shortly before Archer resets the timeline.

As stated above, the episode &quot;E²&quot; takes place in an altered timeline. Except that Lorian is the son of T&#x27;Pol and Tucker, little else is revealed of the alternate Trip. He is long deceased by the time Lorian&#x27;s version of &quot;Enterprise&quot; makes rendezvous with its namesake.

The &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; episode &quot;Fissure Quest&quot; depicts a version of T&#x27;Pol from a timeline where she was married to Tucker for 63 years.

==Mirror Universe==
In the Mirror Universe two-part episode, Tucker is the chief engineer of the ISS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, but is badly disfigured due to exposure from heavy delta ray radiation emanating from his &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s engines. This version of Tucker also had a sexual relationship with the Mirror T&#x27;Pol, who once exploited this relationship in her attempt to sabotage &quot;Enterprise&quot;; she used a mind meld to implant a posthypnotic suggestion in Tucker&#x27;s mind. It is implied this is not the first time she has used him in this way. Tucker is subsequently tortured in the agony booth, but vehemently denies any wrongdoing, insisting that he has always been loyal to the Empire and Archer. In the end, Archer tells Reed to break Tucker before releasing him from the booth, much to Tucker&#x27;s horror. He later confronts T&#x27;Pol in main engineering and tells her he spent four hours in the booth. This version of Tucker, along with much of the ISS &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew, travels to the USS &quot;Defiant&quot; – which had been discovered in the Mirror Universe – and tries to get the ship working to further the Mirror Archer&#x27;s attempt to take over the Terran Empire. Tucker successfully foils a plot by the Mirror Phlox to sabotage key systems aboard &quot;Defiant&quot;.

==Novels==
In the framing story of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; novel, &quot;Last Full Measure&quot; (May 2006), it is revealed that Tucker did not actually die in &quot;These Are the Voyages...&quot;, but survived and lived to be over 120 years of age (Tucker meets the young James T. Kirk and his family). The details of this plot point are revealed in the novel &quot;The Good That Men Do&quot; (written, as was &quot;Last Full Measure&quot;, by Andy Mangels and Michael A. Martin).

In &quot;The Good That Men Do&quot;, Tucker becomes impatient to do something about the coming Romulan threat to Earth, though Starfleet has ordered &quot;Enterprise&quot; to return home to bolster the upcoming formation of the Coalition of Planets (a precursor to the United Federation of Planets).

Tucker&#x27;s crewmate, Malcolm Reed, puts him in contact with Harris who operates within Section 31. Tucker agrees to an undercover mission into Romulan territory to find and neutralize the Romulans&#x27; new warp 7 engine program, which will be faster than almost all other warp drives in existence (at this time the Vulcans had warp 7 capability) and would undoubtedly endanger the Coalition. He is successful, but in the process, he learns that Vulcans and Romulans were once one species. Tucker reluctantly agrees to remain officially &quot;dead&quot;, lest this secret become public and thereby endanger the newly formed coalition. Also, the novel suggests that Tucker&#x27;s extended lifespan is partly due to the genetic engineering he receives to pass as a Romulan.

In the novel &quot;The Romulan War: To Brave the Storm&quot;, it is hinted that although Commander Trip Tucker III is officially classified as dead, a small chance existed that he made it out of the escape pod. Resuming his life under an assumed name, he has two children with T&#x27;Pol, a son and daughter.

==Portrayal==

Connor Trinneer based Trip&#x27;s accent on a character from Oklahoma he had done in a play, only for it to be later established that the character was from Florida.
Before Trinneer was cast, Zach Galligan also auditioned for the role. As a conceptual model for the character Trinneer thought of him as &quot;a wonderkind NASCAR engine guy mechanic who happened to be in this other place.&quot;

==Reception==
In 2009, IGN ranked Trip as the 21st best character of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In 2017, Screen Rant ranked the Trip the 13th most attractive person in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

In 2018, TheWrap ranked Trip Tucker as the 16th best main cast character of &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall.

<text>Percival (, also written Perceval, Parzival, Parsifal), alternatively called Peredur (), is a figure in the legend of King Arthur, often appearing as one of the Knights of the Round Table. First mentioned by the French author Chrétien de Troyes in the tale &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;, he is best known for being the original hero in the quest for the Grail before being replaced in later literature by Galahad.

==Etymology and origin==
The earliest reference to Perceval is found in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27;s first Arthurian romance &quot;Erec et Enide&quot;, where, as &quot;Percevaus li Galois&quot; (Percevaus of Wales), he appears in a list of Arthur&#x27;s knights. In another of Chrétien&#x27;s romances, &quot;Cligés&quot;, Perceval is a &quot;renowned vassal&quot; who is defeated by the knight Cligés in a tournament. He then becomes the eponymous protagonist of Chrétien&#x27;s final romance, &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;.

In the Welsh romance &quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot;, the corresponding figure goes by the name Peredur. The name &quot;Peredur&quot; may derive from Welsh &quot;par&quot; (spear) and &quot;dur&quot; (hard, steel). It is generally accepted that Peredur was a well-established figure before he became the hero of &quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot;. However, the earliest Welsh Arthurian text, &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, does not mention Peredur in any of its extended catalogues of famous and less famous warriors. Peredur does appear in the romance &quot;Geraint and Enid&quot;, which includes &quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot; in a list of warriors accompanying Geraint. A comparable list in the last pages of &quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot; refers to a Peredur &quot;Paladr Hir&quot; (&quot;of the Long Spear-Shaft&quot;), whom Peter Bartrum identifies as the same figure. Peredur may derive in part from the sixth-century Coeling chieftain Peredur son of Eliffer. The Peredur of Welsh romance differs from the Coeling chieftain if only in that his father is called Efrawg, rather than Eliffer, and there is no sign of a brother called Gwrgi. Efrawg, on the other hand, is not an ordinary personal name, but the historical Welsh name for the city of York (; British/Old Welsh: &quot;Cair Ebrauc&quot;; Modern Welsh: &quot;Efrog&quot;). This may represent an epithet that denoted a local association, possibly pointing to Eliffer&#x27;s son as the prototype, but which came to be understood and used as a patronymic in the Welsh Arthurian tales.

Scholars disagree as to the exact relationship between Peredur and Percival. Arthur Groos and Norris J. Lacy argue that it is most likely that the use of the name Peredur in &quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot; &quot;represent[s] an attempt to adapt the name [Perceval] to Welsh onomastic traditions&quot;, as the Welsh romance appears to depend on Chrétien de Troyes, at least partially, as a source, and as the name Peredur is attested for unrelated characters in &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; and &quot;Roman de Brut&quot;. Rachel Bromwich, however, regards the name Perceval as a loose French approximation of the Welsh name Peredur. Roger Sherman Loomis attempted to derive both Perceval and Peredur from the Welsh Pryderi, a mythological figure in the Four Branches of the Mabinogi, a derivation that Groos and Lacy find &quot;now seems even less likely&quot;.

In all of his appearances, Chrétien de Troyes identifies Perceval as &quot;the Welshman&quot; (&quot;li Galois&quot;), indicating that, even if he does not originate in Celtic tradition, he alludes to it. Groos and Lacy argue that, &quot;even though there may have been a pre-existing &#x27;Perceval prototype,&#x27; Chrétien was primarily responsible [...] for the creation of [one of] the most fascinating, complex, and productive characters in Arthurian fiction&quot;.

In some French texts, the name &quot;Perceval&quot; is derived from either Old French &quot;per ce val&quot; (through this valley) or &quot;perce val&quot; (pierce the valley). These etymologies are not found in Chrétien de Troyes, however. &quot;Perlesvaus&quot; etymologizes the name (there: &quot;Pellesvax&quot;) as meaning &quot;He Who Has Lost The Vales&quot;, referring to the loss of land by his father, while also saying Perceval called himself &quot;Par-lui-fet&quot; (made by himself). Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s German &quot;Parzival&quot; provides the meaning &quot;right through the middle&quot; for the name (there: Parzival). Richard Wagner followed a discredited etymology proposed by journalist and historian Joseph Görres that the name derived from Arabic &quot;fal parsi&quot; (pure fool) when choosing the spelling &quot;Parsifal&quot; for the figure in his opera.

==Arthurian legend==
=== Peredur ===
In a large series of episodes, &quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot; tells the story of Peredur&#x27;s education as a knight. It begins with his birth and secluded upbringing as a naive boy by his widowed mother. When he meets a group of knights, he joins them on their way to King Arthur&#x27;s court. Once there, he is ridiculed by Cei and sets out on further adventures, promising to avenge Cei&#x27;s insults to himself and those who defended him. While travelling he meets two of his uncles. The first, who is analogous to the Gornemant of &quot;Perceval&quot;, trains him in arms and warns him not to ask the significance of what he sees. The second uncle is analogous to Chrétien&#x27;s Fisher King, but what Peredur sees being carried before him in his uncle&#x27;s castle is not the Holy Grail (Old French &quot;graal&quot;), but a salver containing a man&#x27;s severed head. The text agrees with the French poem in listing a bleeding lance among the items which are carried in procession. The young knight does not ask about significance of these items and proceeds to further adventure, including a stay with the Nine Witches and the encounter with the woman who was to be his true love, Angharad. Peredur returns to Arthur&#x27;s court, but soon embarks on another series of adventures that do not correspond to material in &quot;Perceval&quot;. Eventually, the hero learns the severed head at his uncle&#x27;s court belonged to his cousin, who had been killed by the Witches. Peredur avenges his family and is celebrated as a hero.

Several elements in the story, such as the severed head on a salver, a hunt for a unicorn, the witches, and a magical board of &quot;gwyddbwyll&quot;, have all been described as Celtic ingredients that are not otherwise present in Chrétien&#x27;s story. Goetinck sees in &quot;Peredur&quot; a variant on the Celtic theme of the sovereignty goddess, who personifies the country and has to be won sexually by the rightful king or heir to secure peace and prosperity for the kingdom. N. Petrovskaia has recently suggested an alternative interpretation, linking the figure of the Empress with Empress Matilda.

=== Perceval ===
Chrétien de Troyes wrote the first story of Perceval as the main character, the unfinished &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;, in the late 12th century. Other famous accounts of his adventures include Wolfram&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot; and the now-lost &quot;Perceval&quot; attributed to Robert de Boron.

There are many versions of Perceval&#x27;s birth. In Robert de Boron&#x27;s account, he is of noble birth, and his father is variably stated to be either Alain le Gros, King Pellinore, or another worthy knight. His mother is usually unnamed, but plays a significant role in the stories. His sister is sometimes the bearer of the Holy Grail, but not originally; she is sometimes named Dindrane. In the tales in which he is Pellinore&#x27;s son, his brothers include Aglovale, Lamorak and Dornar, as well as a half-brother named Tor by his father&#x27;s affair with a peasant woman. After the death of his father, Perceval&#x27;s mother takes him to the forest, where she raises him ignorant of the ways of men until he is 15. Eventually, a group of knights passes through the forest and Perceval is struck by their heroic bearing. Wanting to be a knight himself, he travels to King Arthur&#x27;s court. In some versions, his mother faints in shock upon seeing her son leave. After proving his worthiness as a warrior, he is knighted and invited to join the Knights of the Round Table.

In Chrétien de Troyes&#x27;s &quot;Perceval&quot;, the character is already connected to the Grail. He meets the crippled Fisher King and sees a grail, not yet identified as &quot;holy&quot;, but he fails to ask the question that would heal the injured king. Upon learning of his mistake, Perceval vows to find the Grail castle again and fulfill his quest. The story breaks off soon after, to be continued in a number of different ways by various authors, such as in &quot;Perlesvaus&quot; and &quot;Sir Perceval of Galles&quot;. In the later accounts of Arthurian prose cycles, and consequently Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, the true Grail hero is Galahad, the son of Lancelot, but, though his role in the romances is diminished, Percival remains a major character and is one of only two knights (the other is Bors) who accompany Galahad to the Grail castle and complete the quest with him.

In early versions, Perceval&#x27;s sweetheart is Blanchefleur and he becomes the King of Carbonek after healing the Fisher King. In later versions, he is a virgin who dies after achieving the Grail. In Wolfram&#x27;s version, Perceval&#x27;s son is Lohengrin, the Knight of the Swan.

==In modern culture==
* Most famously, the character appears in Wagner&#x27;s influential and controversial 1882 opera &quot;Parsifal&quot;.
*Daniel Mangrané&#x27;s &quot;The Evil Forest&quot; () is a free retelling set in Spain during the barbarian invasions, with Gustavo Rojo as the titular character. It features some music by Wagner.
*Richard Monaco&#x27;s 1977 book &quot;Parsival: Or, a Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; is a re-telling of the Percival legend.
*Éric Rohmer&#x27;s 1978 film &quot;Perceval le Gallois&quot; is an eccentrically staged interpretation of Chrétien&#x27;s original poem.
*John Boorman&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Excalibur&quot; retells &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; and gives Percival (Perceval) a leading role.
*A version of Percival appears in the 1982-1985 DC Comics limited series &quot;Camelot 3000&quot;.
*The 1991 film &quot;The Fisher King&quot; written by Richard LaGravenese is a modern retelling in which the parallels shift between characters, who discuss the legend.
*In the comic series based on the cartoon &quot;Gargoyles&quot;, Peredur fab Ragnal (Percival&#x27;s Welsh name) achieves the Holy Grail and becomes the Fisher King. To honor his mentor Arthur, he establishes a secret order which will guide the world to greater prosperity and progress, which eventually becomes the Illuminati. Part of achieving the Grail is the bestowal of longevity upon Peredur and his wife, Fleur, along with certain other members of the order being granted longer lifespans. He still appears young in 1996, when his organization comes into conflict with the reawakened Arthur.
*He was the protagonist of the 2000 book &quot;Parzival: The Quest of the Grail Knight&quot; by Katherine Paterson, based on Wolfram&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot;.
*The 2003 novel &quot;Clothar the Frank&quot; by Jack Whyte portrays Perceval as an ally of Lancelot in his travels to Camelot.
*He appears in the French comedy TV series &quot;Kaamelott&quot; as a main character, portrayed by Franck Pitiot. He is depicted as a well-meaning but childish and idiotic knight for whom King Arthur has a soft spot, and is often paired with the equally-incompetent Caradoc.
*In the BBC television series &quot;Merlin&quot;, Percival is a large, strong commoner. After helping to free Camelot from the occupation of Morgana, Morgause, and their immortal army (which is supplied by a grail-like goblet called the Cup of Life), he is knighted along with Lancelot, Elyan and Gwaine, against the common practice that knights are only of noble birth. He is also one of the few Round Table knights to survive Arthur&#x27;s death. He is portrayed by the actor Tom Hopper.
*In Philip Reeve&#x27;s &quot;Here Lies Arthur&quot;, he appears as Peredur, son of Peredur Long-knife, who is raised as a woman by his mother, who had already lost many sons and her husband to war. He befriends the main character, Gwyna/Gwyn. He is one of the few major characters to survive to the end and travels with Gwen (in a male disguise) as &#x27;Peri&#x27;, his childhood shortened name as a woman, playing a harp to Gwen&#x27;s stories.
*Erica Schroeder portrayed a female version of Percival in the video game &quot;Sonic and the Black Knight&quot; (2009). The character&#x27;s appearance was based on Blaze the Cat.
*Wade Watts, the main character of Ernest Cline&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot; (and its film adaptation) names his virtual reality avatar &quot;Parzival&quot; as a reference to Percival and to his role in Arthurian legend, particularly Wade&#x27;s role improving OASIS as the story&#x27;s Fisher-King character.
*Percival appears in Season 5 of the American TV series &quot;Once Upon A Time&quot;. He is one of King Arthur&#x27;s knights, who dances with Regina at the ball when she visits Camelot. Percival, however, recognises her as the Evil Queen and tries to kill her, but he is killed by Prince Charming first.
*Patricia A. McKillip&#x27;s 2016 novel &quot;Kingfisher&quot; includes elements of the story of Percival and the Fisher King. Young Pierce (Percival meaning &quot;pierce the valley&quot;), after a chance meeting with knights, leaves his mother, who has sheltered him from the world and travels to become a knight.
*In Guy Ritchie&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;King Arthur: Legend of the Sword&quot;, Craig McGinlay plays Percy, another of Arthur&#x27;s friends; who is later knighted as Sir Percival.
*In the 2017 television series &quot;Knightfall&quot;, Percival (called &quot;Parsifal&quot;) appears as a young peasant farmer who joins the Knights Templar as a novice knight.
*In the 2020 television series &quot;Cursed&quot;, Billy Jenkins plays a boy, nicknamed Squirrel, who is Percival.
*The 2022 short novel &quot;Spear&quot; by Nicola Griffith is a retelling of the story of Percival. Its protagonist, Peretur, disguises herself as a man and hopes to become a knight.

<text>Hernán Padilla Ramírez (born May 5, 1938) is a retired physician and former two-term Mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico.

== Biography ==
Graduated from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in 1963. After training as a nephrologist, he entered private practice and joined the military with the Puerto Rico National Guard and the U.S. Army Reserve in Fort Meade Maryland. He was sent to active duty during the Gulf War and assigned to Walter Reed Army Medical Center. In 1967, he became politically active, participating in the pro-statehood campaign leading to the July 27 political status plebiscite, as a leader of Estadistas Unidos (Statehooders United), a non-partisan group founded by long-time Statehood Republican Party gubernatorial candidate Luis A. Ferré. On August 20, 1967, at the assembly in Carolina, Puerto Rico at which the organization was dissolved, Padilla and other party leaders proposed the creation of a new political party that would eventually be known as the New Progressive Party (NPP) or Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP) in Spanish.

In January, 1969 and after the NPP&#x27;s electoral triumph and his own election as a state representative, in spite of being a freshman, he was selected as House Majority Leader for the 1969–1973 term. After the NPP&#x27;s defeat in 1972 and his own reelection, he served as Minority Whip until 1977. In 1976, he won the NPP nomination for mayor of San Juan after a three-way competition with attorney Baltasar Corrada del Río and Senator Sila Nazario, and was elected to the post in November of that year, succeeding newly elected Governor Carlos Romero Barceló and Carlos S. Quirós who served a days-long stint as mayor following Romero&#x27;s swearing-in as governor and the official beginning of the 1977–1981 term. His term as mayor was marked by a major expansion of sports and community facilities and the first attempt to wrestle with San Juan&#x27;s looming solid waste crisis. He also served as President of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, being the first Hispanic in that position. Hernan Padilla built the San Juan&#x27;s Municipal Tower in Hato Rey, San Juan&#x27;s Central Park, the Pedrin Zorilla Coliseum, Paseo de Diego, and others installations. He also created San Juan&#x27;s Municipal police department.

Reelected as mayor in 1980, Padilla became increasingly dissatisfied with Romero and the incumbent governor&#x27;s capacity to lead the party to another victory in 1984 after barely winning reelection by less than one-half of one percent margin in 1980. The tensions between both leaders led to Padilla splitting from the NPP and creating the Puerto Rican Renewal Party (PRP), and aspiring for governor under the PRP banner. Pro-statehood votes in 1984 were split between the PRP and the NPP, which renominated Romero, resulting in the Popular Democratic Party return to power, through the election to an unprecedented non-consecutive second term, of Rafael Hernández Colón as governor.

After 1984, he returned to medical practice as a nephrologist, serving with the National Capital Area for Kaiser Permanente. In 1991 he was the subject of one television advertisement by Kaiser that was regularly aired across the United States.

Padilla channelled his post-1984 political energies through national initiatives, serving as chairman for the US Council for Puerto Rico Statehood (USCPRS). He has rejoined the NPP and was the surprise keynote speaker at the party&#x27;s August 2010 convention in Río Grande, Puerto Rico, at the invitation of party president, Gov. Luis Fortuño, who considers Padilla one of his mentors.

Padilla now lives in Miramar, Florida. He is a member of Fraternidad Fi Sigma Alfa since 1956.

In 2009, he was appointed to represent the Puerto Rico House of Representatives on the five-member board of directors of the Puerto Rico Public-Private Partnerships Authority that regulates public-private partnerships in Puerto Rico.

Dr. Padilla writes a weekly column in the largest circulation newspaper in Puerto Rico, El Nuevo Dia, about current political, ideological, economic and administrative issues in Puerto Rico. He also writes a column for El Sentinel, a Spanish weekly publication of the Sun Sentinel in South Florida.

<doc id="456772" wikidata="Q2354342" url="?curid=456772" title="The Makioka Sisters">
<text>is a novel by Japanese writer Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki that was serialized from 1943 to 1948. It follows the lives of the wealthy Makioka family of Osaka from the autumn of 1936 to April 1941, focusing on the family&#x27;s attempts to find a husband for the third sister, Yukiko. It depicts the decline of the family&#x27;s upper-middle-class, suburban lifestyle as the specter of World War II and Allied Occupation hangs over the novel.

It was translated into English by Edward G. Seidensticker, and published by Alfred A. Knopf.

Patrick McCoy of the &quot;Japan Times&quot; described the book as being &quot;Tolstoyan in length and scope.&quot;

==Story==
===Title===

The novel&#x27;s title, , means lightly falling snow and is also used in classical Japanese poetry. The image suggests falling cherry blossoms in early spring—a number of poets confess to confusing falling cherry blossoms with snow. Falling cherry blossoms are a common symbol of impermanence, a prevalent theme of the novel. The in &quot;Sasameyuki&quot; is the same as the &quot;yuki&quot; in Yukiko&#x27;s name, suggesting that she is the central character of the novel.

These nuances do not translate well into English. The translator, Edward Seidensticker, struggled over the title. Translations like &quot;Fine Snow&quot; and &quot;Snow Flurries&quot; do not convey the elegance or layers of meaning in the Japanese title.

===Plot===

;Book One

The Makiokas are an upper-middle-class family from Osaka, Japan. At the time of their father&#x27;s prime, they were one of the wealthiest families in the region, but over the last generation their fortunes have fallen into decline. The main branch lives in Osaka, at the family home, and consists of the eldest sister, Tsuruko, her husband, Tatsuo, who has taken the Makioka name, and their six children. The branch house is located in Ashiya, an affluent suburb between Osaka and Kobe, and consists of the second-oldest sister, Sachiko, her husband, Teinosuke (also an adopted Makioka), and their young daughter, Etsuko. Tsuruko and Sachiko have two younger sisters, Yukiko and Taeko, who are unmarried and move between the main house and the branch house.

As the novel opens, the Makiokas&#x27; pride has led them to dismiss the numerous marriage proposals they have received for Yukiko in the past, but, now that their fortunes have declined, the rate of proposals has slowed, and Yukiko, now thirty, remains without a husband. To make matters worse, her name was mistakenly printed in place of Taeko&#x27;s in a local newspaper story: Taeko had run away with Okubata. Tatsuo demanded a retraction, but instead, the newspaper ran a correction, replacing Yukiko&#x27;s name with Taeko&#x27;s. The article embarrassed the Makioka family and stained both Yukiko&#x27;s and Taeko&#x27;s names; unhappy with the way Tatsuo handled the affair and generally dissatisfied with his cautious nature, Yukiko and Taeko have begun spending most of their time at the Ashiya house. In the wake of the newspaper incident, Taeko finds refuge in doll making—she is quite skilled, and her dolls are sold in department stores. She convinces Sachiko to find her a studio, where she spends a great deal of time working on her dolls.

Itani brings Sachiko a marriage prospect, a man named Segoshi. Hurried by Itani, the family agrees to an informal before they can thoroughly check Segoshi&#x27;s background. The Makiokas become optimistic about their chances of making the match, but are eventually forced to decline when they discover that Segoshi&#x27;s mother is afflicted with a kind of dementia which was considered hereditary.

A few months later, Sachiko receives word of another marriage prospect, this time from an old classmate, Mrs. Jimba. The prospective groom is a middle-aged widower named Nomura. Sachiko is not particularly excited about him, because of his aged appearance, but decides to have him investigated all the same. She asks Mrs. Jimba to give them one or two months to make a decision.
In the meantime, the bank Tatsuo works for has decided to send him to Tokyo to manage a branch office. Despite Tsuruko&#x27;s attachment to the Osaka house, both her and her husband sorely need additional income, as Tatsuo&#x27;s inheritance from the Makioka&#x27;s father is running out. As a result, he and his family will move to Tokyo, and it is decided that Yukiko and Taeko should go with them. Taeko is allowed to stay in Ashiya for a short while to tend to her business, but Yukiko is to leave immediately.

Yukiko is unhappy in Tokyo, and Tsuruko suggests they send her back to Osaka for a while. A follow-up letter regarding Nomura arrives from Mrs. Jimba, just as Sachiko is searching for an excuse to send for Yukiko. Though not enthusiastic about the match, the Makiokas agree to a miai as a pretense for bringing Yukiko back to Ashiya.

Shortly before the miai, Sachiko has a miscarriage, and the Makiokas are forced to postpone meeting Nomura. When Sachiko, Teinosuke, and Yukiko finally meet him, a week later, Sachiko is surprised at how old he looks. After dinner, they are taken back to Nomura&#x27;s house, where he shows them the Buddhist altar where he prays for his dead wife and children. Yukiko, put off by his insensitivity, declares that she cannot marry him. The family refuses Nomura&#x27;s marriage proposal, and Yukiko is sent back to Tokyo.

;Book Two

Taeko&#x27;s interest in dolls wanes and she begins to devote time to Western-style sewing and traditional Osaka dance, taught by Yamamura Saku. A dance recital is held at the Ashiya house with Taeko as one of the performers. A personable young photographer named Itakura takes pictures at the request of Okubata. Itakura and Taeko are already acquainted; he photographs her dolls. 

A month later, a disastrous flood strikes the Kansai region. Taeko is attending a sewing school in the area hardest hit. Itakura rescues her. Impressed by his heroism, Taeko begins to fall for him. Sometime after this, Taeko&#x27;s dancing teacher dies, an occurrence that not only shows the changing times - in order to support her craft, Saku is revealed to have had lived in an extraordinarily small and empty house - but also foils Taeko&#x27;s dreams to be named a successor in the Yamamura school. As a result, she turns her attention yet again towards dress-making

 Eventually Taeko&#x27;s and Itakura&#x27;s relationship becomes suspect to Okubata, who sends a letter to Sachiko. When Sachiko brings up the matter with Taeko, she reveals that she has grown dis-satisfied with Okubata - as a result of his infidelity towards her, and now intends to marry Itakura. Sachiko, however, is disgusted with Itakura for his lower-class upbringing, and opposes her decision; nevertheless, despite the prospect of being disinherited by the main branch, Taeko is determined to marry him. 
Taeko wants to study fashion design in France with her sewing teacher and asks Sachiko to convince the main house to support her, a decision which is opposed by the main house, on the grounds that, when Taeko inevitably marries Okubata, she will have no need to support herself - looking for alternative sources of money, then, could indicate she plans on spurring his advances. When Taeko&#x27;s sewing teacher abandons her plans to go to France, Taeko decides to open a Western-style dress shop. She goes to Tokyo to ask the main house for money, but is immediately called back to Osaka because Itakura has fallen ill.

Itakura is hospitalized for an inner-ear infection and dies of gangrene resulting from complications of surgery. Itakura&#x27;s death alleviates Sachiko&#x27;s concern that Taeko will marry below their class. Taeko, however, attends memorial services for the deceased photographer for five weeks after his death (memorial services are held for seven weeks). 

;Book Three

In June, Tatsuo&#x27;s eldest sister alerts Sachiko of a marriage prospect, a Mr. Sawazaki from a prominent Nagoya family. Sachiko, Yukiko, Taeko, and Etsuko visit Tatsuo&#x27;s sister in Ōgaki so that Yukiko can attend the miai. The miai does not go well: Sachiko is left with a negative impression, and Sawazaki rejects the marriage. This is the first time the Makiokas have been refused by a marriage prospect.

Upon her return, Sachiko hears that Taeko has taken up again with Okubata. As the relationship grows increasingly open, Teinosuke informs Tsuruko. Tsuruko demands that Taeko be sent to Tokyo; Taeko refuses and is disinherited.

Later, Itani presents another marriage prospect for Yukiko. The potential suitor, Hashidera, is an attractive candidate, but he is uncertain if he wants to remarry. Teinosuke takes Yukiko to meet him and goes to great lengths to see the match through, but Yukiko&#x27;s shyness causes Hashidera to call off the negotiations.

Just after this, Sachiko is informed that Taeko has fallen severely ill at Okubata&#x27;s house. At first, it is assumed that she has dysentery, but the diagnosis is later changed to anthrax. Taeko&#x27;s condition grows progressively worse, and the sisters are torn between finding better care and allowing Taeko to be seen at Okubata&#x27;s house. Eventually she is moved to the hospital of a family friend, where she slowly recovers.

Meanwhile, Sachiko is told that Taeko has been living off of Okubata since being disinherited. Sachiko also hears that Taeko may be involved with a bar tender named Miyoshi. Sachiko is aghast, but now sees a marriage between Taeko and Okubata as a necessity. After Taeko has recovered, Sachiko learns that Okubata is being pressured by his family to go to Manchuria; Sachiko and Yukiko think that Taeko should go with him. Taeko objects, but Yukiko pushes her, saying that she is indebted to Okubata for everything he has given her. Taeko leaves the house in tears and stays away for two days. Okubata eventually decides against going to Manchuria.

The Makiokas also learn that Itani is planning to sell her shop and travel to America, but before her departure, Itani informs Sachiko that she has another suitor for Yukiko. His name is Mimaki, an illegitimate son of a viscount. The sisters travel to Tokyo to meet him, and he quickly charms them. While in Tokyo, Taeko tells Sachiko that she is four months pregnant with Miyoshi&#x27;s child. Sachiko and Teinosuke arrange for Taeko to have the baby secretly at Arima. To protect the Makiokas’ reputation, Teinosuke asks Okubata to remain silent about Taeko&#x27;s behavior. Okubata agrees, on condition that Teinosuke compensate him for the money he has spent on Taeko. Teinosuke agrees to pay him two-thousand yen. Taeko&#x27;s baby dies at birth, and Taeko moves in with Miyoshi.

The Makiokas are pressed to answer Mimaki&#x27;s marriage proposal. Yukiko accepts, whereupon Teinosuke sends a letter to the main house asking for their consent. The wedding date and location are set, and a house is secured for the new couple. Yukiko is not excited when her wedding kimono arrives and suffers from diarrhea, which persists on the train ride to Tokyo.

==Background==

Tanizaki was born in Tokyo in 1886. After the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and fire, which destroyed Tokyo, he settled permanently in Kansai, the region where &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot; is set. Many of the characters and events in &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot; are loosely based on real people and events: Sachiko is modeled after Tanizaki&#x27;s third wife, Matsuko, and Sachiko&#x27;s sisters correspond to Matsuko&#x27;s. Sachiko&#x27;s husband, Teinosuke, does not resemble Tanizaki, however. &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot; spans the period from autumn 1936 to April 1941, ending about seven months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The novel references a number of contemporary events, such as the Kobe flood of 1938, the Second Sino-Japanese War, and the growing tensions in Europe. Publication began in 1943, at the height of World War II. The popularity of the novel attracted the attention of government censors, who ordered that publication be halted, saying: “The novel goes on and on detailing the very thing we are most supposed to be on our guard against during this period of wartime emergency: the soft, effeminate, and grossly individualistic lives of women.”

==Themes==

Decline and decay are prominent themes of &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot; and are emphasized by the repetition of certain events. The succession of Yukiko&#x27;s suitors, the Makiokas’ yearly cherry-viewing excursions, and the increasing severity of illness in the novel form a pattern of “decline-in-repetition”. In reaction to this decline, the characters long for an idealized past—they attempt to remain connected to their past through yearly rituals and observances. The Makiokas’ adherence to these rituals connects them to the traditions of the merchant class from the Edo period and reflects Tanizaki&#x27;s belief that the Edo-period culture had been preserved in Osaka. Throughout, the novel contrasts the Kansai and Kantō regions. &quot;Tokyo&#x27;s poverty, bleakness, and disorder serve to set off Ashiya&#x27;s harmonious integration of tradition, modernity, and cosmopolitanism&quot;. By extolling the virtues of the Kansai region in contrast to Tokyo, Tanizaki may have been making a political statement. The unfavorable comparison of Tokyo to Kansai &quot;in the context of the war years, [is] a subversive reminder of the nonmilitary roots of Japanese culture and a sort of &#x27;secret history&#x27; of Japan from 1936 to 1941&quot;.

==Publication==

&quot;Sasameyuki&quot; began as a serial in the magazine &quot;Chūō Kōron&quot; in 1943, but publication was halted by the Information Bureau of the Japanese War Ministry after two installments, the first in the issue for New Year 1943 (now Book 1, Chapters 1 to 8) the second in the issue for March 1943 (now Book 1, Chapters 9 to 13). In 1944, Tanizaki published 248 copies of a privately printed edition of Book One, with financial backing from &quot;Chūō Kōron&quot;; this was, again, censured by the military. After the conclusion of World War II, the novel was published in three parts: Book 1 in 1946, Book 2 in 1947, and Book 3 in 1948.

==Reception and legacy==

The novel has been called “the greatest cosmopolitan novel since the Meiji Restoration”. Following its success, Tanizaki was awarded the Mainichi Prize for Publication and Culture and the Asahi Culture Prize. The novel has been translated into at least 14 languages. The English translation, by Edward G. Seidensticker, was published in 1957 as &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot;.

According to Charles E. Hamilton of the University of California, Berkeley, many reviews in the United States of the English translation were &quot;marked by an air of discomfiture&quot;, with some reviews being uncivil and others offering &quot;factitious praise&quot;. 

Donald Barr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared and contrasted the English translation of the novel with &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen. Barr concluded that &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot; &quot;has in an immense degree the power of veracity, which is second only to the power of truth.&quot; Hamilton argued that Barr&#x27;s comparison with Austen was done &quot;inaptly&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; stated that the book had &quot;a heroism that [...] bends to the winds of fate like a reed and, never breaking, wins the subtler triumph of endurance.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; stated that significant portions of the book &quot;are dull enough to make U.S. readers wonder if they are not in the hands of the Japanese sandman.&quot; According to Hamilton, Anthony West of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, in Hamilton&#x27;s own words, &quot;guyed the book at scurrilous length as a mere exercise in medical naturalism.&quot;

Hamilton himself called the translation in the English version &quot;skillful&quot;. One criticism Hamilton had was the loss of the Kansai dialect in the translation.
