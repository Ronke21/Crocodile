<text>Sir James Robert George Graham, 2nd Baronet (1 June 1792 – 25 October 1861) was a British statesman, who notably served as Home Secretary and First Lord of the Admiralty. He was the eldest son of Sir James Graham, 1st Baronet, by Lady Catherine, eldest daughter of the 7th Earl of Galloway.

In 1819, he married Fanny Callander, youngest daughter of Sir James Campbell of Craigforth and Ardkinglas Castle. Sir James was created Doctor of Laws at the University of Cambridge in 1835, was Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow, 1840. He was First Lord of the Admiralty from 1830 to 1834 when he resigned on account of the government pressing for a reform of the Irish Church. He became Secretary of the Home Department from September 1841 to July 1846 and again First Lord of the Admiralty from December 1852 until February 1855. He was a member of the Council of the Duchy of Lancaster, and Deputy Lieutenant for county of Hertfordshire. He represented Kingston upon Hull from 1818 to 1820; for St Ives in 1820; for Carlisle from 1826 until 1829; for East Cumberland from 1830 until 1837; for Pembrokeshire District from 1838 until 1841; for Dorchester from 1841 until 1847; for Ripon from 1847 until July 1852; and was again returned for Carlisle from 1852 until his death in 1861. Graham Land in Antarctica is named after him.

==Background and education==
Graham was born at Naworth, Cumberland, the son of Sir James Graham, 1st Baronet, by his wife Lady Catherine, daughter of John Stewart, 7th Earl of Galloway. He was taught at a private school at Dalston in Cumberland, kept by the Rev. Walter Fletcher, before attending Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford. He left Oxford after two years and while travelling for his pleasure abroad, he took up a position of private secretary to Lord Montgomerie, British diplomat in Sicily, during the period of the Napoleonic Wars. When Montgomerie became ill the responsibility for the mission fell on Graham. When Lord William Bentinck returned to the Embassy he agreed that Graham should retain the post. During this time he conducted the negotiations which led to the separation of Joachim Murat from Napoleon. When the war ended he returned to England. Back in London he became friends with Wilfrid Lawson, who went on to join Graham in politics. Lawson also became Graham&#x27;s brother-in-law and father to Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet, of Brayton.

==Early political career==
===Whig beginnings===
Back in London, Graham immersed himself in political affairs. Although his father was a staunch Tory he made his headquarters in Brooks&#x27;s Club where he made many Whig contacts. On 10 June 1818 he announced that he would contest the mercantile borough of Hull. Known at the time as the Yorkshire Dandy on account of his fine appearance and flowery speech, he stood on the Whig doctrine of Parliamentary reform, the abolition of unnecessary positions and pensions, peace, retrenchment, the abolition of the slave trade, and religious and civil liberties. After three days of open voting and official scrutiny, Graham entered parliament as the junior member by a mere four votes. However, he had gained the seat at great personal expense and notwithstanding other donations accrued a debt of £6,000. In January 1820, George IV succeeded thus forcing a dissolution of parliament. As a result of his past support for radical measures he failed to gain the necessary support to retain the Yorkshire seat and in consequence he stood and won the Cornish seat of St Ives, heading the poll with 205 votes. At Westminster, Graham maintained his campaign for economy, generally opposing the Government&#x27;s proposed increase in the Royal Family&#x27;s Civil List. However his parliamentary career, although undistinguished, now became brief: when charged with bribing the electorate he resigned rather than contest an expensive suit.

===Agricultural improver===
Graham returned to Cumberland and began a programme of improving the family estate at Netherby, with the intention that such improvements would benefit both the landowner and the tenant. He began with a one-off gesture, wiping out the arrears of his tenants debts. He reduced the number of small uneconomic farms on the estate; he rebuilt the cottages and farm-buildings, introduced tile drains whereby much marshy land was reclaimed, and improved the breed of stock on the estate, spending in excess of £100,000 over a twenty-year period. He eventually studied the Corn Laws and their effects upon the community, publishing his conclusions in a pamphlet of 114 pages entitled &quot;Corn and Currency&quot;, which brought him into prominence as a man of advanced Liberal opinions. He argued that liberal economics rather than protection would best serve the interests of the landowners. High duties on foreign corn had failed to help British agriculture and should be cut to a level where they simply balanced the landowner&#x27;s taxes and rates. Whereas high prices increased rents to the benefit of the landowners they conferred no advantage to the labourer and were an injury to the productive and a tax on the unproductive classes of the community. His general conclusions were in favour of free trade and free banking. He was also a founder member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (later RSPCA).

On 8 July 1819, Graham married Frances (&quot;Fanny&quot;) Callander, of Craigforth and Ardkinglas, a famous society beauty. In 1824 he succeeded to the baronetcy.

== In Parliament ==
===Representative for Cumberland===

At the general election of 1826, Graham, who stood upon principles identical to those advocated when contesting Hull, became the senior member for the city of Carlisle. It was a remarkable contest. When Sir Philip Musgrave, 8th Baronet (1794–1827), the Tory candidate, ventured into one of the poorest districts of the city, he was confronted by a group of non-electors seeking his opinions relating to the Corn Laws. When his views failed to meet with their approval he received a storm of abuse followed by a shower of stones, and a general disturbance ensued. Members of the corporation and the constabulary were man-handled and thrown into the Milldam. In the course of the afternoon a detachment of the 55th regiment of Foot appeared to quell the disturbance. The mob received the troops with a volley of stones, the troops reacted with a hail of ball cartridges and when the smoke cleared two young women lay dead and numerous others lay wounded.
In 1828, the death of John Christian Curwen caused a vacancy in the representation of the county of Cumberland. As a result, Graham resigned his seat and entered parliament in an uncontested election on their behalf.
In 1830 the celebrated &quot;Dalston Dinner&quot; took place, a public dinner given to Graham by a number of the freeholders of the county in testimony of their approbation of his conduct in parliament. During the proceedings Graham declared himself a &quot;party man&quot; under the Blue flag of freedom; declaring.

At the end of July, following the dissolution of parliament, Graham and Sir John Lowther both returned for Cumberland. In 1830 he first made a name in the House of Commons by a motion for the reduction of official salaries, and he increased his reputation by an attack on the salaries received by privy councillors. This gave him a position as one of the more advanced reformers, and in November Earl Grey offered him the post of First Lord of the Admiralty. He was also sworn of the Privy Council. Although this precipitated the need for a new election he was returned unopposed. Graham later became a member of the committee, along with Lord Durham, Lord Duncannon and Lord John Russell charged with the task of compiling and introducing the Reform Act 1832. From 1832 to 1837 he sat for the eastern division of the county of Cumberland.

== First Lord of the Admiralty ==
===Break with Whiggism===

By the summer of 1834, Graham had become a successful minister, the navy was reformed, apart from impressments, and seamen&#x27;s conditions had improved. The Reform Act was assured, and European peace secured. All was well except in Ireland where the unfair system of raising tithes for the church and the problems relating to land tenure prevailed. The discontent of the Irish Catholic majority was strong enough to prevent the collection of tithes to support an antagonistic and as they believed heretical church. Parliament proposed that all compositions for tithes should cease, and that an annual land tax should be paid, out of which provision should be made for the clergy and other tithe owners. As such in 1833, the British Government introduced the Irish Church Temporalities Bill which proposed the administrative and financial restructuring of the Church. The bill sought to reduce the number of both bishoprics and archbishoprics from 22 to 12, to change the structure of the leases of Church lands and to apply the revenues saved by these changes for the use of parishes. Since Graham believed that the union of the two countries principally rested on the church and that any meddling with the establishment would inevitably lead to its downfall he resigned from the government. He did not act alone, Lord Stanley, Lord Ripon and the Duke of Richmond also tendered their resignations. He now became a member of the Derby Dilly. In January 1835, notwithstanding criticism from significant parts of the Cumbrian electorate, Graham reassured his supporters that he still favoured peace, retrenchment and reform and in consequence he was returned unopposed at the general election. On 30 June that year Graham crossed the floor of the House and henceforth sat on the Tory side. Graham now joined the Cumberland Conservative Association, and forsook the Carlisle Journal in favour of the Carlisle Patriot.

==Cumberland rejection==
Graham&#x27;s conduct in Parliament alienated many of his traditional Whig supporters. In 1837, upon the death of William IV and the announcement of a general election, a requisition signed by over 2,500 county freeholders sought the election of two alternative Whig candidates. On the day of the election, freeholders flocked from every part of the division to offer support for the reform candidates. The cavalcade of horsemen, four abreast, many of whom had ridden many miles that morning, stretched over half a mile. Flags and banner, advertising the disapproval of Graham, flew profusely, many of them bearing skits relating to Graham&#x27;s past conduct. On the hustings, Graham found it difficult to obtain a hearing, and in consequence he submitted to his opponents&#x27; cries. At the close of the poll the numbers were: for Francis Aglionby 2,294; for William James 2,124; for Graham 1,505. This ended Graham&#x27;s influence in his home county.

==Home Secretary==
===Entry to government===
In 1838, Sir John Owen, 1st Baronet ordered his son Hugh Owen, MP for Pembroke in Wales, to resign and make way for Graham. Graham won the resulting by-election unopposed and so re-entered Parliament. In 1838 he was elected Rector of the University of Glasgow, an award quickly followed with the Freedom of the same city.

However, Graham&#x27;s tenure in Pembroke was short-lived. In the 1841 general election, Sir John Owen chose to reclaim Pembroke; Graham felt honour-bound to comply and did not stand. Instead, Robert Williams, MP for Dorchester, stood down in favor of Graham, who was elected unopposed there. Sir Robert Peel became Prime Minister and appointed Graham Home Secretary in his cabinet.

In 1842 Graham tried to improve state education in the industrial districts by replacing the existing Factories Act 1833. The 1833 act limited children under 13 to an eight-hour day and provided for two hours of daily compulsory education. Graham&#x27;s new Factories Bill limited children aged between 8 and 13 to a 6.5 hour workday, with 3.5 hours of education, and women and young persons to a maximum of 12 hours work each day. However, a disagreement between the Anglicans and the Dissenters forced a withdrawal of the measure. Graham re-introduced the bill on 7 March 1843, Northern reformers expressed a hatred for Graham; after a fierce parliamentary battle, the bill finally received royal assent after both Peel and Graham threatened to resign.

As Home Secretary he incurred considerable odium in Scotland, by his unconciliating policy on the church question prior to the Disruption of 1843.

===Mazzini letters===
In June 1844, Thomas Slingsby Duncombe brought Parliament&#x27;s attention to an event where certain letters addressed to a foreign refugee had been opened and copied in the course of transmission through the London Post Office under the warrant of Graham at the Home Office. The letters from Emilio and Attilo Bandiera (residing at the time in Corfu) to Giuseppe Mazzini, an Italian freedom fighter, disclosed their intention to take part in an armed insurrection upon the coast at Calabria. Duncombe suggested that the Foreign Office had then passed the information to the Neapolitan court through a link with the Austrian authorities. When the group landed at the pre-arranged place, they were instantly killed. Although a secret committee convened at Parliament&#x27;s request exonerated the government, the discussion was renewed in the following session, after Richard Lalor Sheil censured the government for its actions. Graham vigorously defended his actions, stating that the Secretary of State had been invested by Parliament with the power, in certain cases, of issuing warrants directing letters to be opened. The division took place in a very thin house and the government survived by a mere 16 votes. The events haunted Graham for the rest of his life; as he told his nephew, &quot;he knew, when he was gone, none of his reforms would be recollected, but that he would only be remembered as the man who opened the letters of the Italians.&quot;

===Free trade===
Notwithstanding his apparent support for a degree of relaxation in the Corn Law legislation as stated &#x27;Corn and Currency&#x27;, Graham remained hostile to major reform. In 1839, he argued that repeal would ruin British agriculture; he supported protection and defended a fixed duty. He supported William Huskisson&#x27;s policy in 1828, he drew up the 1833 report, supported the continuation of the Corn Laws in 1834, and opposed Lord John Russell&#x27;s fixed duty plan in 1836. However, by 1842 his hard line approach had begun to soften. Henceforth he played a leading role in planning a policy which began by including the introduction of a sliding scale for a levy on the price of corn, the reintroduction of income tax, and a massive change in overall tariffs. Old prohibitions were removed and duties on raw, partly manufactured and fully made imports were limited to a maximum of 5, 12 and 20 per cent. It was argued that the loss occasioned by reducing duties on 769 of some 1200 durable articles would be covered by increased trade and production. In 1843, Graham admitted to the Commons that &#x27;free Trade&#x27; principles were the principles of common sense. In 1845, with Graham&#x27;s support, 430 of the remaining 813 dutiable articles were freed, and other duties lowered, all export taxes abolished, payments on raw cotton and glass ended and timber and sugar preferences modified. In early 1846, Peel proposed, in a three-hour speech, that the Corn Laws would be abolished on 1 February 1849, after three years of gradual reductions of the tariff, leaving only a 1 shilling duty per quarter. Benjamin Disraeli and Lord George Bentinck emerged as the most forceful opponents of repeal in Parliamentary debates, arguing that repeal would weaken landowners socially and politically and therefore destroy the &#x27;territorial constitution&#x27; of Britain by empowering commercial interests. On the third reading of Peel&#x27;s Bill of Repeal (Importation Act 1846) on 15 May, MPs voted 327 votes to 229 (a majority of 98) to repeal the Corn Laws. On 25 June the Duke of Wellington persuaded the House of Lords to pass it. On that same night Graham&#x27;s Preservation of Life Bill (Irish Coercion) was defeated in the Commons by 292 to 219 by &#x27;a combination of Whigs, Radicals, and Tory protectionists&#x27;. On 29 June Peel resigned as Prime Minister. As a result, the Conservative Party divided and the Whigs formed a government with Russell as Prime Minister. Those Conservatives who were loyal to Peel became known as the Peelites, they included Graham, the Earl of Aberdeen and William Ewart Gladstone.

==Peelite==
In the 1847 general election, the Ripon constituency returned Graham unopposed. He had resigned from the Carlton Club, and although he received offers of cabinet positions from both sides of the political spectrum, he remained loyal to Peel and hostile to any reversal of Free Trade legislation. He saw the repeal of the Navigation Acts as a vital step in the liberal march, protection or no protection was the battlefield between reaction and progress. After Peel&#x27;s untimely death, Graham and Aberdeen became the unofficial leaders of the 100 conservative members who had supported free trade. However Graham had lost the support of the influential men who controlled the Ripon seat and while he contemplated his next move a reacquisition arrived from Carlisle, in which almost 500 electors had promised support. On 7 July 1852, Graham returned in triumph at the head of the poll. At the victory dinner, Graham mocked protection calling it &#x27;outdoor relief to distressed landlords&#x27;, he also reaffirmed is support for restrained reform. In December that year the Tory government resigned and Lord Aberdeen became prime minister of a Whig, Peelite, Radical, Liberal alliance. Graham now returned to the Cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty. Shortly afterwards the Eastern Question raised its ugly head and within weeks the Britain and France drifted into the Crimean War with Russia. Graham ordered the fleet to sail through the Dardanelles and eventually into the Black Sea. In April 1854, Queen Victoria recognised Graham services by awarding him the Civil Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. However, once installed notwithstanding previously stating that &quot;If driven to war, he was for waging it with the utmost vigour and inflicting as much injury as they could on Russia&quot; the naval action stalled and the war dragged on. Graham was responsible for the choice of Sir Charles Napier to command the fleet in the Baltic. Sir Charles did not relish the inactivity to which he was reduced by the strength of the fortresses of Kronstadt and Sveaborg, which he was forbidden to attack, except in conjunction with the French fleet. The French refused to join in the attempt, and Sir Charles loudly complained on his return of his treatment by the admiralty. It does not seem that Graham was to blame; the shutting up of the Russian fleet was a service of sufficient importance without the glory of an attack upon fortresses which would have cost much bloodshed without an adequate return. On 29 January 1855, John Arthur Roebuck carried a motion demanding an inquiry into the conduct of the war and three weeks later Aberdeen and Graham tendered their resignations.

In 1857, Graham opposed Lord Palmerston&#x27;s Gunboat diplomacy when bombarding Canton after the Chinese authority&#x27;s seized the Lorcha &quot;Arrow&quot;. Notwithstanding the unpopularity of this decision he was returned in the election at Carlisle. However, the Peelite party had been routed, to all intent it was no more. He contested Carlisle again in 1859, where with his nephew their joint election went against the general trend and returned two liberal candidates. Later that year a group of 280 like minded members, including Graham and Lawson, met in Willis&#x27;s Rooms to form the Liberal Party. A two party system had returned to British politics.

On 25 October 1861, Graham died, exactly four years after the death of his wife.

==Orator==
Graham was as a speaker exceedingly polished, but tended to pomposity, and carried the habit of quotation to inordinate lengths. His speeches were enlivened by epigrams and by passages of splendid rhetoric; but their construction was always artificial. He is remembered as an orator for a number of brilliant sayings rather than for any great speech. He never succeeded in getting outside himself and identifying himself with his audience. Similarly his political judgment was too much swayed by personal considerations, and he said of himself: &#x27;In a party sense it must be owned that mine has been a devious career.&#x27; He was too self-conscious in all that he did to be a great statesman; but he was an impressive personality in the House of Commons, and was an able administrator. Where he failed he failed not through want of foresight or political intelligence, but through a defect of personal sympathy.

==Retrospective==
At the time of his death the Oxford dandy, the amateur diplomat, and the glamorous parliamentarian had served in many fields, and become an important force in the creation of Victorian Britain. But what did Graham think of his own achievements? In 1852, he reminded the Carlisle electorate of his past achievements:
His nephew offered a fitting tribute:
==Family==
Graham married Frances (&quot;Fanny&quot;) Callander, of Craigforth and Ardkinglas, a famous society beauty, on 8 July 1819. She died in October 1857. Graham died at Netherby, Cumberland, on 25 October 1861, aged 69, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son, Frederick.

He was godfather to James Graham Goodenough (who was named after him).

<doc id="447066" wikidata="Q381445" url="?curid=447066" title="Tony Kaye (musician)">
<text>Anthony John Selvidge (born 11 January 1946), known professionally as Tony Kaye, is an English keyboardist, best known as a founding member of the progressive rock band Yes. Born into a musical family, Kaye was classically trained and intended to become a concert pianist before he developed an interest in jazz and contemporary rock and pop music. He joined several groups throughout the 1960s, including the Federals, Johnny Taylor&#x27;s Star Combo, Jimmy Winston &amp; His Reflections, and Bittersweet.

From 1968 to 1971, Kaye was a member of Yes and played on their first three albums. He then formed Badger and relocated to Los Angeles in 1974, after which he toured with David Bowie and joined Detective. Kaye then played in Badfinger and is featured on their final studio album in 1981. He returned to Yes in 1983 before leaving in 1994.

Kaye has since been involved with several projects with Billy Sherwood and is a current member of CIRCA:. From 2009 to 2011, the two were also members of the supergroup Yoso with members of Toto. In 2017, Kaye was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Yes.

== Early life ==
Kaye was born on 11 January 1946 in Leicester to Winifred and Norman. He grew up in a working-class family in north London, with four brothers.

His grandmother was a concert pianist and his grandfather a jazz saxophonist; upon her death she left Kaye her grand piano which he played on when he was little. At age four, Kaye began formal piano lessons with Ms. Flanagan who became a strong influence on him musically and philosophically. By the time he reached eight, he had started to enjoy playing and displayed the ability to recite several classical music pieces. Kaye took part in his first concerts at twelve in solo and duet piano performances. He continued lessons until he turned eighteen. Kaye aspired to pursue study at the Royal College of Music in London to become a concert pianist, but he developed an interest in other music once he heard jazz musicians Count Basie and Duke Ellington. He was also inspired by Victor Borge. During his time at grammar school, he formed a jazz trio with friends, and at fifteen, became a member of the Leicester-based Danny Rogers Orchestra, playing four gigs a week. The leader put Kaye on a postal course in arrangement. Kaye also received lessons in the clarinet and played the instrument as part of a big band.

After Kaye left school, he chose not to pursue classical piano due to the heavy competition and a lack of self-belief. He also wished to avoid teaching music, which led to his three-year enrolment at Leicester Art College studying advertising and design while performing in groups or the big band in his spare time. Kaye was asked to leave the college before he could graduate, a trip to Europe having left him &quot;mixed up and dissatisfied&quot;.

== Career ==
=== 1963–1968: Early bands ===

By the early 1960s, Kaye had abandoned his classical background in favour of pop and rock music. He had moved to London, and visited The Marquee club to watch bands play, including keyboardist Graham Bond whose style became a strong influence. Kaye had acquired a Vox Continental, a transistor-based combo organ, while in the big band and until seeing Bond, had played it &quot;like a piano&quot;.

Kaye landed a position in The Federals through an advertisement in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and played on their singles recorded between 1963 and 1967, Mainly a covers and comedy showband, the group opened for Roy Orbison for a European tour in 1965. Kaye then became a member of Yellow Passion Loaf and Johnny Taylor&#x27;s Star Combo, followed by Jimmy Winston &amp; His Reflections, also known as Winston&#x27;s Fumbs. Also that year he toured Europe once more, this time with French singer Johnny Hallyday. Kaye then had a brief stint as a member of Bittersweet.

=== 1968–1971: Yes ===
In 1968, Kaye was invited to attend rehearsals with members of Mabel Greer&#x27;s Toyshop, a London-based psychedelic rock band who were forming a new, full-time group. He was approached by bassist Chris Squire after singer Jon Anderson had met Kaye some time before and suggested him. After a successful audition, they renamed themselves Yes and began touring nationwide from August 1968. By the end of the year, the band had earned enough money to purchase a Hammond organ for Kaye. During his first tenure in Yes, Kaye played on their first three studio albums: &quot;Yes&quot; (1969), &quot;Time and a Word&quot; (1970), and &quot;The Yes Album&quot; (1971). The latter includes Kaye&#x27;s first songwriting credit which he received on the group-written track &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot;. To promote the album, Kaye embarked on the band&#x27;s first concert tour of the US in June and July 1971.

During rehearsals for their next album, &quot;Fragile&quot; (1971), Kaye began to have problems with new guitarist Steve Howe who kept insisting the band expand their sound with electronic keyboards such as the Mellotron and synthesiser. Kaye disagreed with this approach and preferred organ and piano. Kaye was fired and quickly replaced by Rick Wakeman of The Strawbs who re-recorded some parts originally written by Kaye, including sections on &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot;. Kaye later revealed that Yes&#x27;s manager Brian Lane gave him US$10,000 (approx. $62,000 in 2018 dollars) in exchange for all of his royalties.

=== 1971–1982: Flash, Badger, Detective, and Badfinger ===

Kaye joined several groups for the remainder of the decade. He played on the self-titled debut album by Flash, a band founded by ex-Yes guitarist Peter Banks but declined their offer to become a full-time member. Kaye then formed Badger with bassist David Foster, a friend of Jon Anderson&#x27;s who also co-wrote some early Yes songs. They released &quot;One Live Badger&quot; (1973), recorded in concert with Jon Anderson producing, and &quot;White Lady&quot; (1974), recorded in New Orleans with producer Allen Toussaint featuring Jackie Lomax on vocals. Kaye also re-united with Yes bandmate Chris Squire and new Yes drummer Alan White when they appeared on the Eddie Harris album &quot;E.H. in the U.K.&quot; (1973), playing Moog on &quot;I Waited for You&quot; and &quot;Conversations of Everything and Nothing&quot;.

Shortly after releasing Badger&#x27;s &quot;White Lady&quot;, Kaye recalled the group &quot;wasn&#x27;t really doing anything&quot; and decided to leave England and relocate to Los Angeles. He initially settled in Hyatt House on Sunset Boulevard next door to Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham. Kaye developed an addiction to alcohol and barbiturates during this time and underwent a successful withdrawal program, after which he remained sober. In January 1976, during a birthday party held for Kaye at the Rainbow Bar and Grill, he met David Bowie&#x27;s tour manager and accepted his offer to join Bowie in Jamaica to prepare for his upcoming tour in support of &quot;Station to Station&quot;. The Isolar – 1976 Tour reached North America and Europe from February to May 1976; Kaye is featured on the bonus live tracks on the 1990 and 2010 reissues of the album.

In 1977, Kaye had returned to Los Angeles and joined Detective with singer Michael Des Barres. The group signed to Led Zeppelin&#x27;s label Swan Song Records and toured as the opening act for Kiss. Kaye played on their two studio albums: &quot;Detective&quot; (1977) and &quot;It Takes One to Know One&quot; (1977), as well as the promotional only release, &quot;Live from the Atlantic Studios&quot; (1978). Around 1979, Kaye took up work in music production and management in the Los Angeles area in various capacities for around three years.

In 1979, Kaye accepted an invitation to join Badfinger for their upcoming North American tour. He was unaware of the band&#x27;s turbulent history until he read a 1998 biography on them. Despite the tour containing dates at &quot;really shitty clubs with small audiences&quot;, Kaye proved to be a strong performer. Drummer Peter Clarke recalled that at each gig, Kaye had requested venue staff have two ice buckets, one for each hand, ready so he could put his hands in them after the show. Clarke added, &quot;they were like balloons afterwards, just throbbing&quot;. Kaye spoke highly of the tour and the band got along well, but they lacked the right management. He resumed management work at its conclusion, but returned in late 1980 after he was chosen to play in a new line-up. Early rehearsals turned sour, and Kaye went on to bring in Richard Bryans on drums and Glenn Sherba on guitar. Kaye is featured on &quot;Say No More&quot;, their final studio album of all new material, released in 1981.

=== 1982–1994: Return to Yes ===
In 1982, Kaye was invited to form a new band with Squire, Alan White, and singer and guitarist Trevor Rabin. Much of their new material derived from a set of demos produced by Rabin that displayed a more pop-oriented and commercial style of rock music, and Squire thought of Kaye as their ideal keyboardist due to his simpler, more textural approach. Kaye accepted Squire&#x27;s offer and entered rehearsals in London under the name Cinema with producer Trevor Horn for &quot;90125&quot;. However, conflicts between Kaye and Horn led to the former&#x27;s exit after several months, leaving Rabin to handle the remaining keyboard parts. By mid-1983, Jon Anderson had also joined the band as lead singer and it was decided, after some hesitation, to rename this new lineup &#x27;Yes&#x27;. Kaye, in the meantime, had rejoined Badfinger and gone off on a North American tour and was replaced by Eddie Jobson. When this tour ended in October, Kaye accepted an offer by management to return to Yes where he and Jobson would share keyboard duties. This, however, did not sit well with Jobson, who left shortly thereafter. 

&quot;90125&quot; had included greater use of MIDI technology, which reignited Kaye&#x27;s interest in contemporary keyboards unlike the time of his first departure from Yes. He was absent from the group during filming of the video to &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot;, the lead single from &quot;90125&quot;, shots of Jobson having been removed from the sequence as much as possible. A second video for &#x27;Owner&#x27; featuring the band with Kaye was subsequently produced. &quot;90125&quot; became Yes&#x27;s highest selling album which was supported by a 12-month world tour. Kaye operated a MIDI system of analogue and digital keyboards on the tour, two of which he played on stage which controlled additional samples and sound effects from 12 keyboards placed backstage that were co-handled by keyboard programmer Casey Young. His solo spot on the tour, titled &quot;Si&quot;, is included on the live album &quot;9012Live: The Solos&quot;. Yes then recorded &quot;Big Generator&quot; with Kaye playing a majority of the keyboard parts with some minor assistance from Trevor Rabin. Before recording, Kaye and his technician Robby Eagle built a MIDI keyboard system to his specifications.

After touring in 1988, Yes remained inactive for two years. Around this time, Kaye committed to a solo instrumental album for Cinema Records and Lee Abrams. The album was fully written, but it was recorded with a drum machine which Kaye grew tired of, and he felt the music better suited with vocals and backing musicians, so he abandoned the work. From 1990 to 1992, Kaye was a part of the eight-member formation of Yes that produced &quot;Union&quot; and played on the album&#x27;s supporting tour. The tour marked the first time Kaye and Rick Wakeman met and worked together. In contrast to Wakeman&#x27;s battery of keyboards, Kaye adopted a simpler set-up of two Yamaha KX76s. 

Kaye stayed with Yes for their next album &quot;Talk&quot;, which featured the &quot;90125&quot; and &quot;Big Generator&quot; line-up and which credits Kaye on the Hammond organ only, the rest of the keyboard parts being performed by Rabin. On their 1994 tour, however, Kaye did play most keyboard parts, using master keyboards which played additional sounds and samples from racks placed beneath the stage. In 1995, both Kaye and Rabin left Yes, Kaye&#x27;s offer to stay on in a management capacity having been turned down.

=== 1994–present: Recent activity ===

Between the mid-1990s and early 2000s, Kaye was largely retired from the music industry, although he did appear on a number of archival Yes releases, including &quot;Something&#x27;s Coming: The BBC Recordings 1969–1970&quot; and &quot;The Word is Live&quot;. Kaye went on to play in the Neil Young tribute band The Neil Deal, and assisted in production duties for his wife, actress and singer Daniela Torchia.

Around 2006, Yes member Billy Sherwood asked Kaye to play on some Pink Floyd tribute albums that he was overseeing. Kaye had been out of the music industry for some time and was partly residing in the Cayman Islands. A big fan of Pink Floyd, Kaye could not refuse the offer and &quot;got my B3 out of retirement&quot;. During the recording sessions, the pair entered discussions on forming a new band which led to the announcement of CIRCA: in 2007. Since transporting Kaye&#x27;s B3 to Sherwood&#x27;s studio and gigs was too difficult, Kaye plays the software synthesiser Hammond B4 from a laptop through a controller keyboard. Both formed the short lived supergroup Yoso which formed in 2009 and disbanded in 2011.

In 2018, Kaye joined Yes on stage as a special guest for their Cruise to the Edge dates and for the American dates on their 50th Anniversary Tour.

Kaye&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;End of Innocence&quot;, was released on 10 September 2021 through Spirit of Unicorn Music and distributed via Cherry Red Records. The album is a musical interpretation of his thoughts and feelings over the events surrounding September 11 attacks in 2001, and the aftermath.

== Style and reception ==
Kaye is known for his more simple, more supportive style of playing and avoids long and improvised solos. Yes biographer Tim Morse named Kaye a &quot;&#x27;gentleman of rock&#x27; for his polite demeanour and his distinguished looks&quot;. Longtime Yes producer and mixer Eddy Offord named Kaye as one of the best Hammond organists. Guitarist Steve Howe named Kaye a &quot;good group member&quot; and praised his contributions to Yes. Geoff Downes said he had always admired Kaye&#x27;s playing and the sound he got from the Hammond.

== Personal life ==
In 1974, Kaye left England and moved to Los Angeles, California. He has not acquired American citizenship. In 2011, he stated Sherman Oaks as his place of residence. In 2019, Kaye relocated to Sarasota, Florida.

Kaye has tinnitus in his left ear. He was once engaged to Squire&#x27;s stepdaughter Carmen, but he later married actress and singer-songwriter Daniela Torchia.

Kaye is a keen tennis player and played in professional tournaments in the 1980s. Kaye began a series of small businesses apart from music. He has been involved in a number of legal actions against Yes&#x27;s former manager Brian Lane over alleged unpaid royalties.

Kaye unsuccessfully auditioned for the part of the Hammond player in the mock-documentary &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;.

<doc id="447068" wikidata="Q7336209" url="?curid=447068" title="Risk-based pricing">
<text>Risk-based pricing is a methodology adopted by many lenders in the mortgage and financial services industries. It has been in use for many years as lenders try to measure loan risk in terms of interest rates and other fees. The interest rate on a loan is determined not only by the time value of money, but also by the lender&#x27;s estimate of the probability that the borrower will default on the loan. A borrower who the lender thinks is less likely to default will be offered a better (lower) interest rate. This means that different borrowers will pay different rates. 

The lender may consider a variety of factors in assessing the probability of default. These factors might be characteristics of the individual borrower, like the borrower&#x27;s credit score or employment status. These factors might also be characteristics of the loan; for example, a mortgage lender might offer different rates to the same borrower, depending on whether that borrower wished to buy a single-family house or a condominium.

Concerns have been raised about the extent to which risk-based pricing increases borrowing costs for the poor, who are generally more likely to default, and thereby further increases their likelihood of default. Supporters also argue that risk-based pricing expands access to credit for high-risk borrowers (who are often lower-income), by allowing lenders to price this increased risk into the loan.

==Risk factors==

Credit score and history, property use, property type, loan amount, loan purpose, income, and asset amounts, as well as documentation levels, property location, and others (employment details, designation, etc.), are common risk based factors currently used. Lenders &#x27;price&#x27; loans according to these individual factors and their multiple derivatives. Each derivative either positively or negatively affects the cost of an interest rate. For example, lower credit scores equal higher interest rates and vice versa; typically, those who provide less verifiable income documentation due to self-employment benefits will qualify for a higher interest rate than someone who fully documents all reported income. Mortgage and other financial service industries value credit score and history most when pricing mortgage interest rates.

==Property types==
Pertaining to residential mortgages and their risk based pricing methods, the Property Type is sub-categorized as follows:

* Single Family Residence (SFR)
* Multi-Family 2-4 Units (MF)
* Townhome/Condominium (TC)

SFRs are considered to have the highest dollar value per square foot and are thus the most favorably priced of the property types in the eyes of the lending institution. The property is stand alone, or &#x27;detached&#x27; from other property.

Multi-family and townhome/condominiums are typically &#x27;negatively priced&#x27;, where the lender will assess a .5% to .75% increase in the actual interest rate or the price of an interest rate, due to their relative lower dollar per square foot values.

==Property use==
Pertaining to residential mortgages and their risk based pricing methods the property use can be sub-categorized as follows:
* Primary residence
* Second home
* Non-owner occupied or investment property

A primary residence is viewed and priced as the lowest risk factor of Property Use. There are no adjustments to pricing or rate. 

A second home is viewed and priced according to lender, some will assess the same risk factor as a primary residence while others will factor in a 0.125% to 0.5% pricing increase to mitigate the perceived risk. Lenders perceive that the borrower is less likely to value the second home if the borrower was faced with financial difficulties.

A non-owner occupied property is viewed and priced as the highest risk factor of property use. Lenders will factor in a 0.5% to 2.5% pricing increase to mitigate the perceived risk.

==Criticism==
The main criticism among mainstream consumers has been that risk-based pricing can make &#x27;shopping&#x27; for the best interest rates much more difficult. It is almost impossible to tell at first glance if one can be qualified to get an advertised rate or exactly what interest rate they qualify for at all. Consumer-rights advocates also believe that risk-based pricing in the extreme, especially in the form of predatory lending, hurts financially disadvantaged and vulnerable consumers by cutting them off from reasonably affordable capital and exposing them unwittingly to soaring interest rates and unsustainable financing schemes that erode equity and may lead to default. Risk-based pricing can be manipulated to wield deceptive marketing practices, such as the bait and switch. The fairness of similar lending practices within the mortgage industry is being investigated by the United States Congress.

<doc id="447070" wikidata="Q953400" url="?curid=447070" title="Psi Upsilon">
<text>Psi Upsilon (), commonly known as Psi U, is a North American fraternity, founded at Union College on November 24, 1833. The fraternity has chartered fifty chapters at colleges and universities throughout North America, some of which are inactive.

Psi Upsilon&#x27;s foundation provides scholarships and other financial guidance to students throughout the United States and Canada, giving preference to its members, as well as mentoring and other support services.

==History==
In 1833, five sophomore and two freshman members of the Delphian Society, a local literary group, had become friends and began to meet regularly to exchange essays and engage in literary debate. The seven men thus founded Psi Upsilon on the evening of November 24, 1833. The first constitution was adopted on January 10, 1834.

The first expansion chapter was started in 1837 when a member of Psi Upsilon at Union transferred to New York University. Ten chapters were founded in the first ten years, and eight more chapters were founded in the twenty years after that. By 1904, when the last founding father, Edward Martindale, died, there were 23 chapters and more than 11,000 members.

During World War II, a few chapters, such as the Omicron, rented their houses to the Army as barracks and offices.One chapter, the Epsilon Nu, rented its house to a sorority (Gamma Phi Beta). The rental income these chapters received allowed them to survive. Other chapters, such as the Lambda and Eta, could not afford the taxes and upkeep on an empty house and had to sell.

After the war, the executive council hired professional staff and established a central office to assist chapters. At first, the office consolidated initiation records and address lists, published a newsletter and secured the fraternity&#x27;s historical artifacts. Over time, the staff&#x27;s size and function grew. Young alumni were hired to visit chapters as educational and leadership consultants, reviewing chapter operations and suggesting ways to improve. Leadership training was developed and expanded, and regular conclaves began to be held to train officers and alumni. Handbooks were published for each officer position and general programs. Alumni associations were given professional advice on fundraising and house renovations. Within twelve years of the end of the war, five chapters were reactivated and four new chapters were chartered.

===Fraternity firsts===
Psi Upsilon was the first fraternity to
* Hold a fraternity convention (1841) 
* Print a membership catalogue (1842)
* Print the fraternity history (1843)
* Print a fraternity songbook (1849)
* Issue a fraternity magazine (1850)

== Symbols ==
Psi Upsilon&#x27;s badge is a diamond, with the fraternity&#x27;s emblem on clasped hands and the Greek letters . Its pledge pin is a garnet and gold diamond.

The fraternity&#x27;s motto is &quot;Unto us has befallen a mighty friendship&quot;. Psi Upsilon&#x27;s colors are garnet and gold. Its flower is the Alstroemeria liley. Its symbol is the diamond and its mascot is the owl. The fraternity&#x27;s publication is &quot;The Diamond of Psi Upsilon&quot;. Its nickname is Psi U.

== Chapters ==
The fraternity has chartered fifty chapters at colleges and universities throughout North America, some of which are inactive.

== Governance ==
Most chapters of Psi Upsilon retain the same type of governance: a president, two vice presidents, a recording secretary, and a treasurer. Its president presides over all meetings and enforces obedience to the constitution and the chapter bylaws. The first vice president is the internal vice president and helps maintain an efficient system of communication among the brothers. The second vice president is the external vice president and serves as coordinator for public relations. The chapter may also have other leadership positions.

Its national headquarters is located at 3003 East 96th Street in Indianapolis, Indiana.

== Notable members ==
== Controversies and member misconduct ==

=== Co-educational shift ===
In 1971, Bowdoin College, formerly all-male, decided to admit women to the college. The members of &quot;Kappa chapter&quot; of Psi Upsilon also voted to accept women that year becoming the first co-ed fraternity on Bowdoin&#x27;s campus and in Psi Upsilon.In 1976, Patricia “Barney” Geller attended the national meeting as Kappa&#x27;s president. And Psi U distinguished itself by not revoking Kappa&#x27;s charter status.Instead the &quot;Kappa chapter&quot; admitted members of both sexes for as long as it existed and was only the first in Psi U to do so.

In 2014, Wesleyan University required all male-only fraternities to become coeducational, partly in response to issues with sexual assault and harassment. At the time, Psi Upsilon and Delta Kappa Epsilon were the only recognized fraternities at the school. After Delta Kappa Epsilon&#x27;s housing was closed for failing to comply with the changes, Psi Upsilon was the remaining fraternity at the school. The fraternity agreed to become coeducational, but the chapter&#x27;s housing was temporarily suspended by the school before any female students could join. The closure was pending a drug investigation and past claims of sexual assault . As of September 2016, the chapter&#x27;s house was expected to reopen with both male and female members.

=== University of Pennsylvania chapter closure ===
On Saturday, January 20, 1990, the brothers of Psi Upsilon&#x27;s Penn chapter kidnapped a rival fraternity member, subjecting him to various forms of physical and mental abuse. Penn kicked Psi U off campus less than five months later. During the drive, the Psi U officers played a tape of a Malcolm X speech containing references to violence directed at whites. Because this tape was played at a loud volume O&#x27;Flanagan believed that no one would be able to hear any possible cries for help. The Psi U officers and pledges drove O&#x27;Flanagan to a secluded playground/park area. O’Flanagan said, “I&#x27;m not Sheffield, I&#x27;m Billy O&#x27;Flanagan.&quot; Someone then said, “Oh shit.&quot; O&#x27;Flanagan replied, Take me back now and I&#x27;ll forget about it. but they ignored his request. They encircled O&#x27;Flanagan whispering to him again the phrase &#x27;Sheffield Deathfield&#x27;. O&#x27;Flanagan told them that he was not Sheffield. They, however, did not release O&#x27;Flanagan. They also taunted O&#x27;Flanagan by referring to lynchings in the South, in Alabama. O&#x27;Flanagan remained handcuffed to the metal structure for some time. He was barefoot and only minimally clothed, and the night was cold and rainy. O&#x27;Flanagan was kept at the playground/park area in the custody of two Psi U pledges while the Psi U officers and pledges who had come to this site went to get food and check in by telephone with [a Psi U officer] at the Psi U fraternity house. Before these Psi U officers and pledges left, one of them said to O’Flanagan, &#x27;We&#x27;re coming back with something you won’t want to eat.&#x27; They then conducted a mock “trial&quot; which consisted in part of O&#x27;Flanagan&#x27;s being subjected to physical discomfort, emotional distress, and repeated and intense verbal abuse.

=== Cornell chapter closure ===

In July 2016, the president of Psi Upsilon&#x27;s Chi chapter at Cornell University was indicted by a grand jury for sexual abuse of a female Cornell student in the fraternity house. The crime allegedly took place in late January of that year, with initial charges brought in early February. In May the accused student sued Cornell University, saying that their investigation process was flawed and non-compliant with recent changes in State law. The chapter has been suspended by both the national leadership of the fraternity, and Cornell University, although the university cited other violations. Following a racist assault on a Black student by white members of the house in September 2017, the chapter&#x27;s alumni board voted to close the chapter indefinitely.

<doc id="447074" wikidata="Q465773" url="?curid=447074" title="The Wages of Fear">
<text>The Wages of Fear () is a 1953 thriller film directed and co-written by Henri-Georges Clouzot, and starring Yves Montand, Charles Vanel, Peter van Eyck and Véra Clouzot. The film centres on a group of four down-on-their-luck European men who are hired by an American oil company to drive two trucks, loaded with nitroglycerin needed to extinguish an oil well fire, over mountain dirt roads. It is adapted from a 1950 French novel by Georges Arnaud.

The film brought Clouzot international fame—winning both the Golden Bear and the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1953 Berlin Film Festival and Cannes Film Festival, respectively—and enabled him to direct &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; (1955). In France, it was the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with a total of nearly 7 million admissions.

==Plot==
Frenchmen Mario and Jo, Dutchman Bimba and Italian Luigi are stuck in the isolated town of Las Piedras. Surrounded by desert, the town is linked to the outside world only by an airstrip, but the airfare is beyond the means of the men. There is little opportunity for employment aside from the American corporation that dominates the town, Southern Oil Company (SOC), which operates the nearby oil fields and owns a walled compound within the town. SOC exploits local workers and takes the law into its own hands, but the townspeople depend on it and suffer in silence.

Mario is a sarcastic Corsican playboy who treats his devoted lover, Linda, with disdain. Jo is an aging ex-gangster who recently found himself stranded in the town. Bimba is an intense, quiet man whose father was murdered by the Nazis and who himself worked for three years in a salt mine. Luigi, Mario&#x27;s roommate, is a jovial, hardworking man, who has just learned that he is dying from cement dust in his lungs. Mario befriends Jo due to their common background, having lived in Paris, but a rift develops between Jo and the other cantina regulars due to his combative, arrogant personality.

A large fire erupts at one of the SOC oil fields. The only way to extinguish the flames and cap the well is an explosion produced by nitroglycerin. With short notice and lack of proper equipment, it must be transported within jerrycans placed in two large trucks from the SOC headquarters, 500 km (300 miles) away. Due to the poor condition of the roads and the highly volatile nature of nitroglycerin, the job is considered too dangerous for the unionized SOC employees.

The company foreman, Bill O&#x27;Brien, recruits truck drivers from the local community. Despite the dangers, many of the locals volunteer, lured by the high pay: US$2,000 per driver. This is a fortune to them, perhaps the only way out of their dead-end lives. The pool of applicants is narrowed down to four drivers: Mario, Bimba and Luigi are chosen, along with a German named Smerloff. Smerloff fails to appear on the appointed day, so Jo, who knows O&#x27; Brien from his bootlegging days, takes his place. The other drivers suspect that Jo intimidated Smerloff in some way to facilitate his own hiring.

Jo and Mario transport the nitroglycerin in one vehicle; Luigi and Bimba are in the other, with thirty minutes separating them in order to limit potential casualties. The drivers are forced to deal with a series of physical and mental obstacles, including a stretch of extremely rough road called &quot;the washboard&quot;, a construction barricade that forces them to teeter around a rotten platform above a precipice, and a boulder blocking the road. Jo finds that his nerves are not what they used to be, and the others confront Jo about his increasing cowardice. Finally, Luigi and Bimba&#x27;s truck explodes without warning, killing them both.

Mario and Jo arrive at the scene of the explosion only to find a large crater rapidly filling with oil from a pipeline ruptured in the blast. Jo exits the vehicle to help Mario navigate through the oil-filled crater. The truck, however, is in danger of becoming bogged down and, during their frantic attempts to prevent it from getting stuck, Mario runs over Jo. Although the vehicle is ultimately freed from the muck, Jo is mortally injured. On their arrival at the oil field, Mario and Jo are hailed as heroes, but Jo is dead and Mario collapses from exhaustion. Upon his recovery, he heads home in the same truck. He collects double the wages following his friends&#x27; deaths and refuses the chauffeur offered by SOC. Mario jubilantly drives down a mountain road as a party is being held at the cantina back in town, where Mario&#x27;s friends eagerly await his arrival. He swerves recklessly and intentionally, having cheated death so many times on the same road. Linda, dancing in the cantina, faints. Mario takes a corner too fast and plunges through the guardrail to his death.

==Cast==
==Reception and legacy==
&quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; was critically hailed upon its original release. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The excitement derives entirely from the awareness of nitroglycerine and the gingerly, breathless handling of it. You sit there waiting for the theatre to explode&quot;. The film was also a hit with the public, selling 6,944,306 tickets in France where it was the fourth highest earning film of the year.

In 1982, Pauline Kael called it &quot;an existential thriller—the most original and shocking French melodrama of the 50s. ... When you can be blown up at any moment only a fool believes that character determines fate. ... If this isn&#x27;t a parable of man&#x27;s position in the modern world, it&#x27;s at least an illustration of it. ... The violence is not used simply for excitement--it&#x27;s used as in Eisenstein&#x27;s and Buñuel&#x27;s films: to force a vision of human experience.&quot; In 1992, Roger Ebert stated that &quot;The film&#x27;s extended suspense sequences deserve a place among the great stretches of cinema.&quot; Leonard Maltin awarded the film out of 4 stars, calling it a &quot;marvelously gritty and extremely suspenseful epic&quot;.
In 2019, the film was ranked No. 9 in &quot;Empire&quot;″s &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema.&quot; The website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 100% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 53 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.90/10. Its critics consensus reads: &quot;An existential suspense classic, &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; blends nonstop suspense with biting satire; its influence is still being felt on today&#x27;s thrillers.&quot; Metacritic reports a score of 85 out of 100 based on 15 critic reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

The British-American filmmaker Christopher Nolan was strongly influenced by &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; for his film &quot;Dunkirk&quot;.

==Restoration and home video==
One of the best known and most successful of Clouzot&#x27;s films, &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; has been widely-released on every home video format. However, with the exception of a French DVD (TF1 Vidéo, 2001) featuring the original 153-minute French theatrical version, until recently most releases only contained a slightly edited 148-minute version. A comprehensive 4K restoration, based on the original negative was completed by TF1 Studio in 2017. The 4K colour correction was carried out by &quot;Jérôme Bigueur&quot; under the supervision of Guillaume Schiffman. It has greatly improved audio and video quality, and has been released on Blu-ray, DVD and DCP in France (TF1 Vidéo), the UK (BFI) and Japan (IVC).

The film was colourised in 1996 with the approval of Clouzot&#x27;s daughter. It was subsequently broadcast on French television and released on French VHS.

&quot;Violent Road&quot; (aka &quot;Hell&#x27;s Highway&quot;), directed by Howard W. Koch in 1958, and &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, directed by William Friedkin in 1977, are American remakes, although the former is not credited as such. Friedkin described the latter as an adaptation of the original novel.

The plot was adapted for an episode of the 1980s American TV series &quot;MacGyver&quot;, &quot;Hellfire&quot; (S01E08).

A third remake was released in late March 2024 by Netflix. Directed by Julien Leclercq, the new film stars Franck Gastambide, Alban Lenoir, Ana Girardot and Sofiane Zermani.

<doc id="447076" wikidata="Q949529" url="?curid=447076" title="Honi soit qui mal y pense">
<text> (, ; ) is a maxim in the Anglo-Norman language, a dialect of Old Norman French spoken by the medieval ruling class in England, meaning &quot;shamed be whoever thinks ill of it&quot;, usually translated as &quot;shame on anyone who thinks evil of it&quot;. It is the motto of the British chivalric Order of the Garter, the highest of all British knighthoods.

==Origin==
King Edward III founded the Order of the Garter around the time of his claim to the French throne. The traditional year of foundation is usually given as 1348 (when it was formally proclaimed).

According to Polydore Vergil&#x27;s &quot;Anglica Historia&quot;, written in 1512–1513, 166 years after the event, the origin was a trivial mishap at a court function. King Edward III was dancing with Joan of Kent, his first cousin and daughter-in-law, at a ball held in Calais to celebrate the fall of the city after the Battle of Crécy. Her garter slipped down to her ankle, causing those around her to laugh at her humiliation. Edward placed the garter around his own leg, saying: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Shame on anyone who thinks evil of it. Whoever is laughing at this [thing] today will later be proud to wear it.&quot;). Scholars typically consider this version to be apocryphal, as there are no contemporary sources for it, and as garters were not worn by women at that time.

According to David Nash Ford:

===Sir Gawain and the Green Knight===
The motto in Anglo-Norman, a dialect of Old Norman French spoken by the medieval ruling class in England, appears in the late 14th century Middle English poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; as , at the end of the text in the manuscript, albeit in a later hand. The poem is connected to the Order of the Garter.
In the poem, a girdle, very similar in its erotic undertones to the garter, plays a prominent role. A rough equivalent of the Order&#x27;s motto 
has been identified in Gawain&#x27;s exclamation (&quot;cursed be both cowardice and coveting&quot;, v. 2374). 
While the author of the poem remains disputed, there seems to be a connection between two of the top candidates and the Order of the Garter, John of Gaunt, and Enguerrand de Coucy, seventh Sire de Coucy. De Coucy was married to King Edward III&#x27;s daughter, Isabella, and was admitted to the Order of the Garter on their wedding day.

==Heraldic use==

In English heraldry, the motto is used either as a stand-alone motto upon a motto scroll, or upon a circular representation of the Garter. Knights and Ladies of the Garter are entitled to encircle the escutcheon of their arms with the garter and motto (e.g. The 1st Duke of Marlborough).

The latter usage can also be seen in the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, with the motto of the royal arms, , being displayed on a scroll beneath the shield. As part of the royal arms, the motto is displayed in many public buildings in Britain and colonial era public buildings in various parts of the Commonwealth (such as all Courts of England and Wales). The royal arms (and motto) appear on many British government official documents (e.g. the front of current British passports); on packaging and stationery of companies operating under Royal Warrant (e.g. the banner of &quot;The Times&quot;, which uses the royal coat of arms of Great Britain circa 1714 to 1800); and are used by other entities so distinguished by the British monarch (e.g. as the official emblem of the Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot;).

Several military organisations in the Commonwealth incorporate the motto inscribed upon a garter of the order within their badges (or cyphers) and some use as their motto. Corps and regiments using the motto in this fashion are (&#x27;*&#x27; indicates usage as a motto in addition to inclusion in the badge):
* Also used on items, e.g., the baton, of the Society of High Constables of Edinburgh (founded 1611), along with the phrase &#x27; nisi dominus frustra&#x27;.
* British Army: the Royal Horse Artillery; Household Cavalry Regiment; Life Guards (motto appears in the Garter Star representation worn on Life Guard officer&#x27;s helmets rather than in the unit badge); Blues and Royals; Royal Engineers; Grenadier Guards*; Coldstream Guards; Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment; Royal Regiment of Fusiliers; and the Royal Logistic Corps (which in April 1993 became an amalgamation of the trades of five corps, which included the Royal Corps of Transport the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, The Royal Pioneer Corps, the Army Catering Corps and the Postal and Courier Services of the Royal Engineers, all of these forming Corps used the motto inscribed garter in their badge).
* Australian Army: the Royal Australian Engineers* (motto is one of two used); Royal Australian Army Service Corps (merged in 1973 into the newly raised RACT (and who did not use the motto), and the Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps); 
* Canadian Army: The Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards, The Royal Regiment of Canada, The Royal Montreal Regiment* and The Royal Canadian Horse Artillery. 
* New Zealand Army: the 6th Hauraki Infantry Regiment.

<text>Sampford Courtenay is a village and civil parish in West Devon in England, most famous for being the place where the Western Rebellion, otherwise known as the Prayerbook rebellion, first started, and where the rebels made their final stand. It has a population of around 600.

The Church of St Andrew is mainly built of granite and has an elegant tower.

Between 1867 and 1972, the village was served by the nearby Sampford Courtenay railway station at Belstone Corner. The station reopened for the heritage Dartmoor Railway between 2002 and 2021, after which it closed permanently. Network Rail reclaimed ownership of the Dartmoor line between and in 2021, but have no plans to reopen the station.

==Literature==
Sampford Courtenay is the area author M.R. James had in mind for his short ghost story Martin&#x27;s Close published in More Ghost Stories in 1911. The New Inn featured in this story is also a real place and a grade II listed old coaching inn originally built in the 16th century.

<text>Experiential education is a philosophy of education that describes the process that occurs between a teacher and student that infuses direct experience with the learning environment and content. This concept is distinct from experiential learning, however experiential learning is a subfield and operates under the methodologies associated with experiential education. The Association for Experiential Education regards experiential education as &quot;a philosophy that informs many methodologies in which educators purposefully engage with learners in direct experience and focused reflection in order to increase knowledge, develop skills, clarify values, and develop people&#x27;s capacity to contribute to their communities&quot;. The Journal of Experiential Education publishes peer-reviewed empirical and theoretical academic research within the field.

==Foundations==
The philosophy of experiential education is closely linked to numerous other educational theories, but it should not be conflated with progressive education, critical pedagogy, youth empowerment, feminist-based education, and constructivism. The development of experiential education as a philosophy has been intertwined with the development of these other educational theories but there are differences between them.

John Dewey was the most famous proponent of hands-on learning or experiential education, which was discussed in his book &quot;Experience and Education,&quot; published in 1938. It expressed his ideas about curriculum theory in the context of historical debates about school organization and the need to have experience as a fundamental aspect. Dewey&#x27;s fame during that period rested on relentlessly critiquing public education and pointing out that the authoritarian, strict, pre-ordained knowledge approach of modern traditional education was too concerned with delivering knowledge, and not enough with understanding students&#x27; experiences.

Dewey advocated that education be based upon the quality of experience. For an experience to be educational, Dewey believed that certain parameters had to be met, the most important of which is that the experience has continuity and interaction. Continuity is the idea that the experience comes from and leads to other experiences, in essence propelling the person to learn more. Interaction is when the experience meets the internal needs or goals of a person. Dewey also categorizes experiences as possibly being mis-educative and non-educative. A mis-educative experience is one that stops or distorts growth for future experiences. A non-educative experience is one in which a person has not done any reflection and so has obtained nothing for mental growth that is lasting.

Dewey&#x27;s work influenced dozens of other prominent experiential models and advocates in the later 20th century, including Foxfire, service learning, Kurt Hahn and Outward Bound, and Paulo Freire, who is often cited in works on experiential education. Friere focused on participation by students in experience and radical democracy, and the creation of &quot;praxis&quot; among learners.

==Development in Asian countries==

Experiential methods in education have existed in China for over two thousand years, since the time Confucius began promoting the educational style. John Dewey was in China in the early 1900s and his ideas were extremely popular. 

Established in 1973, &quot;Breakthrough&quot; in Hong Kong was the first non-profit organization that applied the concepts of experiential education (though primarily conceptualized in terms of outdoor adventure education) in youth works. Since then, development in experiential education has proceeded in Singapore, Taiwan, Macau, and some large cities in China.

Experiential education started in Qatar in 2010 through AL-Bairaq, which is an outreach, non-traditional educational program that targets high school students and focuses on a curriculum based on STEM fields. The idea behind AL-Bairaq is to offer high school students the opportunity to connect with the research environment in the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at Qatar University. Faculty members train and mentor the students and help develop and enhance their critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills, using a hands-on-activities approach.

Starting in the twenty-teens, experiential education organizations in Asia begin gaining accreditation by the Association for Experiential Education, which had historically primarily served a North American audience. Outward Bound Hong Kong was accredited in 2011, followed by Chadwick International in Korea in 2019 and the Hanifl Centre in 2020.

==Change in roles and structures==
In addition to the notions raised by Dewey, recent research has shown that experiential learning does not replace traditional methods of learning but supplements it to offer additional skills, perspectives, and understanding of relationships. Students participating in authentic activities can experience real consequences as they are meeting learning objectives. The experiential approach aligns with Armstrong&#x27;s claims that students, rather than teachers, should be responsible for their learning. Proponents claim that an experiential education mindset can change the way teachers and students view knowledge as learning becomes active and transacted within life or lifelike situations. Experiential education can also link traditional scholarly priorities (e.g. formal knowledge production) with improvement of professional practice. 

Whether teachers employ experiential education in the form of laboratory and clinical learning, cultural journalism, service learning, environmental education, the approach involves engaging students in active roles for the purpose of learning. Experiential education can involve various tools like field work, policy and civic activity, and entrepreneurship outside of the classroom along with games, simulations, and role plays. In these activities, students may establish group goals, practice decision-making skills, and develop leadership skills, which can also enhance student motivation and confidence. According to Ernie Stringer, &quot;Action learners move through continuous cycles of this inquiry process to improve their understanding, extend their knowledge, or refine their skills.&quot; 

Besides changing student roles, experiential education requires a change in the role of teachers. The approach requires teachers to position themselves as facilitators of experiences and learning that may take students outside of the classroom. Because action precedes attempts to synthesize knowledge, teachers generally cannot plan or implement a curriculum unit as a neat, predictable package. Yet, a well-planned curriculum is still necessary to ensure experiential learning results in meaningful student learning. Teachers may become active learners, too, experimenting with their students, reflecting upon the learning activities they have designed, and responding to their students&#x27; reactions to the activities. With less dependence on prescribed curriculum, teachers may come to view themselves as more than just recipients of external curriculum decisions.

As students and teachers take on more active roles, the traditional organizational structures of the school need adjustment. For example, at the Challenger Middle School in Colorado Springs, Colorado, service activities are an integral part of the academic program. Accommodating service learning requires large time blocks that necessitate specialized scheduling. At the University Heights Alternative School in the Bronx, the Project Adventure experiential learning program has led the faculty to adopt an all-day time block as an alternative to the traditional 45-minute periods. The faculty now organizes the curriculum by project instead of by separate disciplines.

At the university level, programs may be entirely field-taught on outdoor expeditions. These courses combine traditional academic readings and written assignments with field observations, service projects, open discussions of course material, and meetings with local speakers who are involved with the course subjects. These &quot;hybrid&quot; experiential/traditional programs aim to provide the academic rigor of a classroom course with the breadth and personal connections of experiential education.

==Practice==

The methodologies reflected in experiential education have evolved since the time of Hahn and Dewey. For experiential education to be an effective pedagogy, physical experience must be combined with reflection. Adding reflective practice, allows for consolidation of key learnings. Further, for the efficacy of experiential education, the learner must be given sufficient time to process the information.

Experiential education informs many educational practices in schools (formal education) and out-of-school (informal education) programs. Many teaching methods rely on experiential education to provide context and frameworks for learning through action and reflection while others at higher levels (university and professional education) focus on field skills and modeling. Examples of specific methods are outlined below.

*Outdoor education uses organized learning activities that occur in the outdoors, and uses environmental experiences as a learning tool.
*Adventure education may use the philosophy of experiential education in developing team and group skills in both students and adults. Initially, work to solve problems. For example, in a ropes course designed to build the teamwork skills, a faculty or student team might work together to get the entire group over a 12-foot wall or through an intricate web of rope. After each challenge, the group debriefs how it functioned as a team and how the insights gained from the experience transfers to other environments.
*Service learning is a combination of community service with stated learning goals, relying on experience as the foundation for meaning. Students provide meaningful service while simultaneously gaining new skills, knowledge and understanding as an integrated aspect of an academic program.
*Active learning, a term popular in US education circles in the 1980s, encourages learners to take responsibility for their learning, requiring their experience in education to inform their process of learning.
*Environmental education is based in educating learners about relationships within the natural environment and how those relationships are interdependent. Students participate in outdoor activities as part of their learning experience.
*Vocational education involves training for an occupation.
*Sandwich degrees involve a year working in industry during academic study.

== Examples ==
Centers in the US offering experiential education include Presidential Classroom, Global College, the New England Literature Program at the University of Michigan, the Chicago Center for Urban Life and Culture, GoBeyond Student Travel, and the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America.

Several Australian high schools have established experiential education programmes, including Caulfield Grammar School&#x27;s five-week internationalism programs in Nanjing, China and Geelong Grammar School&#x27;s Timbertop outdoor education program.

At the professional school level, experiential education is often integrated into a curriculum in &quot;clinical&quot; courses following the medical school model of &quot;See one, Do one, Teach one&quot;, in which students learn by practicing medicine. This approach is being introduced in other professions in which skills are directly worked into courses to teach every concept. These concepts include interviewing, listening skills, negotiation, contract writing and advocacy.

==Methods==

There are multiple ways in which experiential education is practiced. Examples of experiential learning methods used include:

*Active-based learning – All participants in the group must engage actively in working together toward the stated objectives.
*Cooperative learning - students work on tasks in interdependent groupings.
*Place-based learning – The process of using local community and environment as a starting point to teach concepts in language arts, mathematics, social studies, science, and other subjects across the curriculum.
*Problem-based learning – Provides a structure for discovery that helps students internalize learning and leads to greater comprehension.
*Project-based learning – An instructional method that uses projects as the central focus of instruction in a variety of disciplines.
*Simulation-based learning – A combination of active, problem, project, and place-based learning; Participants are placed in a simulated environment and given objectives requiring constant attention and care.
* Experience Builders connect work to learning by helping students gain real-world work experience and experiential knowledge within a mentored project-based learning environment.

<text>Bernd Rosemeyer (14 October 1909 – 28 January 1938) was a German racing driver and speed record holder. He is often considered one of the greatest racing drivers of his era.

== Career ==

Rosemeyer&#x27;s father owned an auto and motorcycle garage and repair shop &quot;Rosemeyer &amp; Co sur Bahnhofstraße&quot;, where young Rosemeyer worked on motorcycles and cars. Having started by racing motorcycles, Rosemeyer became a member of the Auto Union racing team with hardly any experience in racing cars. This was later considered a benefit as he was not yet used to the handling of traditional layout race cars. The Ferdinand Porsche-designed mid-engined Silver Arrows of Auto Union were fast, but hard to drive, and only he, Tazio Nuvolari and to a lesser extent Hans Stuck truly mastered the machines. Rosemeyer was also a very skilled mechanic, so, like Hermann Lang of Mercedes, he was able to give good technical feedback to Dr. Porsche and development engineer Eberan von Eberhorst to further develop the Auto Union cars and set his cars up for races to make them quicker and easier to drive.

In only his second ever Grand Prix, at the daunting Nürburgring, Rosemeyer took the lead from the great Rudolf Caracciola and was almost in sight of the finish line when he missed a gear and was overtaken. However, in subsequent years he made up for this mistake by winning three consecutive races at the Nürburgring, one famously in thick fog. Later in 1935 he won his first Grand Prix at the Brno Masaryk Circuit in Czechoslovakia.

Whilst on the podium in 1935 at the Czechoslovakian Grand Prix he was introduced to the famous aviator Elly Beinhorn. Their celebrity relationship was too good an opportunity to miss for the Nazi Party. Rosemeyer and Beinhorn were exalted and instrumentalized by the Nazi Party to the ideal German celebrity couple of that time. Rosemeyer joined the SS in November 1933, though it is not known if he did it out of opportunism or ideological sympathies. Though he was not a member of the Nazi Party, he was made a member of the SS for propaganda purposes and held the rank of Hauptsturmführer.

Several sensational Grand Prix motor racing victories in 1936 and 1937, in addition to the AAA-sanctioned Vanderbilt Cup in the U.S, made him popular not only in Germany. He won the European driving championship in 1936. Of the twelve Grands Prix contested in 1937 between Mercedes and Auto Union, Rosemeyer won four of Auto Union&#x27;s five victories against Mercedes&#x27;s formidable new W125. Rosemeyer&#x27;s superlative performances that year cemented him alongside Rudolf Caracciola and Tazio Nuvolari as three of the greatest drivers of 1930s Grand Prix racing.

His marriage to Beinhorn added even more celebrity hype. It also made it possible for him to learn to fly a private plane. Before a testing session, he once used a now-defunct airfield next to the &quot;Flugplatz&quot; section of the Nürburgring as a landing strip, and rolled his plane to the pits via the race track - in the opposite direction.

His son Bernd Jr. was born in November 1937, only ten weeks before his death.

Rosemeyer considered 13 to be his lucky number. He was married on 13 July 1936. 13 days later he won the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. His last Nürburgring victory came on 13 June 1937. His last race victory came at his 13th start of the 1937 season at Donington Park.

== Fatal record attempt ==

Rosemeyer was killed during a land speed record attempt on a regular traffic route on the Autobahn between Frankfurt and Darmstadt on 28 January 1938.

Competing for the record against Rudolf Caracciola, Rosemeyer went out later in the day in his Auto Union streamliner, setting a new class record of 432 km/h (268 mph). In an effort to raise the record still higher, despite a report that wind was picking up, Rosemeyer took the streamliner again. After two preliminary runs he was on his third and final attempt at 11:47, when the car suddenly went out of control. Whether caught by a gust of wind or by an unforeseen aerodynamic effect, it skidded to the left onto the median, then right and off the highway, where it went airborne and collided with a bridge embankment. Rosemeyer was thrown out of the car as it somersaulted through the air; he died at the roadside.

== Memorial ==

The Rosemeyer memorial is south of Frankfurt at the Rosemeyer layby (German: &quot;Bernd-Rosemeyer-Parkplatz&quot;) on the southbound side of A5 motorway at kilometer marker 508. At the south end of the layby a footpath leads west into the forest, where the memorial is located at .

Audi honoured the 100th anniversary of Rosemeyer&#x27;s birth by placing a wreath at the memorial.

Audi built a concept car, the Audi Rosemeyer, which combined elements of modern design with styling strongly resembling the former Auto Union &quot;Silver Arrows&quot; Grand Prix racers, namely their 16-cylinder car driven by Rosemeyer, after which the car is named.

There is also a bronze memorial situated next to the entrance to the Donington Park Museum in Leicestershire.

Bernd Rosemeyer is buried in the Waldfriedhof Dahlem on Hüttenweg in Berlin.

In his birthplace of Lingen (Ems), Bahnhofstraße, where the racer grew up, was renamed by the Nazi Party in his honor as &quot;Bernd-Rosemeyer-Straße&quot; in 1938. In addition, the city is the home of Motorsport Club &quot;MSC Bernd Rosemeyer Lingen e.V. im ADAC&quot;, founded in 1964. The namesake &quot;Autohaus Rosemeyer&quot; at Lindenstraße 7 closed its doors on 30 November 2003.

<doc id="447096" wikidata="Q839366" url="?curid=447096" title="Masked lapwing">
<text>The masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) is a large, common and conspicuous bird native to Australia (particularly the northern and eastern parts of the continent), New Zealand and New Guinea. It spends most of its time on the ground searching for food such as insects and worms, and has several distinctive calls. It is common in Australian fields and open land, and is known for its defensive swooping behaviour during the nesting season.

Despite the species being also known as the masked plover and often called the spur-winged plover or just plover in its native range, lapwings are classified to their own subfamily, Vanellinae, and not to the closely related plover subfamily, Charadriinae. There are two subspecies: the nominate subspecies and the southern &quot;novaehollandiae&quot;. The latter has distinctive black markings on the shoulder and side of the chest, and is sometimes recognized as a separate species: the black-shouldered lapwing (&quot;Vanellus novaehollandiae&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
The masked lapwing was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; in 1781. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot;. This was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Tringa miles&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The type locality was originally given in error as Louisiana. The locality was re-designated by the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews in 1912 as Timor Laut (the Tanimbar Islands). The current genus &quot;Vanellus&quot; was erected by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. &quot;Vanellus&quot; is the Modern Latin for a &quot;lapwing&quot;. It is a diminutive of the Latin &quot;vanus&quot; meaning &quot;winnowing&quot; or &quot;fan&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;miles&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;soldier&quot;.

Two subspecies are usually recognised:

* &quot;V. m. miles&quot; (Boddaert, 1783) - Coastal New Guinea, Aru Islands, northern Australia
* &quot;V. m. novaehollandiae&quot; Stephens, 1819 - southern Australia, New Zealand. This taxon was formerly known as the spur-winged plover.

The Handbook of Birds of the World treats &quot;V. m. novaehollandiae&quot; as a separate species, the black-shouldered lapwing (&quot;Vanellus novaehollandiae&quot;), even though the two subspecies intergrade in northern Queensland and the Lake Eyre basin.

== Description ==
The masked lapwing is the largest representative of the family Charadriidae. It measures from in length and has a wingspan of , and has a conspicuous yellow spur on the carpal joint of each wing. The nominate subspecies (&quot;V. m. miles&quot;) weighs , while the southern race (&quot;V. m. novaehollandiae&quot;) is larger and weighs .

The subspecies from northern Australia and New Guinea (&quot;V. m. miles&quot;) has an all-white neck and large yellow wattles, with the male having a distinctive mask and larger wattles. The subspecies found in the southern and eastern states of Australia and in New Zealand (&quot;V. m. novaehollandiae&quot;), and often locally called the spur-winged plover, has a black neck-stripe and smaller wattles. (Note that the northern-hemisphere spur-winged plover is a different bird.)

The birds have a wide range of calls which can be heard at any time of the day or night: the warning call, a loud defending call, courtship calls, calls to its young, and others. Since the bird lives on the ground, it is always alert and, even though it rests, it never sleeps properly.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Masked lapwings are most common around the edges of wetlands and in other moist, open environments, but are adaptable and can often be found in surprisingly arid areas. They can also be found on beaches and coastlines. &quot;Vanellus miles novaehollandiae&quot; spread naturally to Southland, New Zealand in the 1930s and has now spread throughout New Zealand, where it is recognised as a self-introduced native and known as the spur-winged plover.

== Behaviour ==

Masked lapwings are shy and harmless in summer and autumn but are best known for their bold nesting habits, being quite prepared to make a nest on almost any stretch of open ground, including suburban parks and gardens, school ovals, and even supermarket carparks and flat rooftops. They can be particularly dangerous at airports where their reluctance to move from their nesting area, even for large aircraft, has resulted in several bird strikes. Breeding usually happens after winter solstice (June 21), but sometimes before. The nesting pair defends their territory against all intruders by calling loudly, spreading their wings, and then swooping fast and low, striking at interlopers, if necessary, with their feet, and attacking animals on the ground with the conspicuous yellow spur on the carpal joint of the wing. The bird may also use diversion tactics against potential predators, such as fiercely protecting a non-existent nest, or a distraction display of hopping on a single leg, to attract attention to itself and away from its real nest, or from its chicks after they have commenced foraging. 

There is a widely-believed myth that the spur can inject venom. That may have been based on fear of the masked lapwing&#x27;s territorial behaviour. Attacks are most vicious on other birds, such as ravens, and also on cats and dogs, but once the chicks reach 60% of full size after two or three months, the chances of that happening decrease. Strikes are much rarer on humans because they are more aware. Sometimes the bird can damage its wing in a strike but usually survives, although it is flightless while the wing heals. Some masked lapwings, especially those living in residential suburban areas, may never successfully breed, due to increased disturbance from domestic pets, people on footpaths, and cars. Commonly, two birds are seen together, a male and a female which are almost identical. They can be seen in groups at times, especially while feeding on coastlines. The chick reaches full growth after four or five months and will often stay with the parents for from one to two years, resulting in family groups of three to five birds nesting in one location over the summer. Their lifespan is approximately 16 years.

The birds spend much of the time on the ground, searching for worms and insects to feed on.

<doc id="447106" wikidata="Q978606" url="?curid=447106" title="Luke McCormick (footballer, born 1983)">
<text>Luke Martin McCormick (born 15 August 1983) is an English footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Southern Football League side Plymouth Parkway.

Starting his career at Plymouth Argyle, McCormick was jailed for causing death by dangerous driving in 2008 after he killed two children. He was released from prison on 6 June 2012.

He returned to football playing on non-contract terms for Truro City in November 2012, before returning to league football on 31 January 2013 with Oxford United. He was released at the end of the 2012–13 season and, in May 2013, re-signed for Plymouth Argyle on a one-year contract. In July 2014, McCormick was assigned the role of &#x27;club captain&#x27; at Plymouth Argyle (although the current captain was Curtis Nelson). In August 2016, McCormick became captain of the club after Nelson joined Oxford United. He left Plymouth Argyle at the end of the 2018 season after making 347 appearances for the club. In the summer of 2018 he signed for Swindon Town on a free deal. He went on to make 29 league appearances for the club and played as backup to Steven Benda as the club won the League Two title in 2019–20. After being released by the Robins, McCormick signed for League One Plymouth Argyle for the third time in his career.

==Career==
===Early career===
McCormick came through the ranks at Plymouth Argyle, making his debut on the final day of the 2000–01 season, in a 0–0 draw at home to Rochdale. The following 2001–02 season, McCormick didn&#x27;t feature at all, with Argyle opting for emergency-loan signing Chris Adamson ahead of McCormick, for the one game missed by Frenchman Romain Larrieu that season. In the 2002–03 season, unavailability from Larrieu saw McCormick play five games in a row, starting with a 2–1 Football League Trophy win against Chester City. He would play in the following two league games, before being dropped for emergency-loan signing Danny Milosevic, who in his one game for Argyle got injured, and substituted off for McCormick. He played his final game of the season on 12 November, in a 1–0 defeat to Brentford in the Football League Trophy.

====Contention with Larrieu====
An injury to Larrieu early in the 2003–04 season saw McCormick become first choice for the rest of the campaign, playing 43 games across all competitions, as Argyle were promoted as Champions of Division Two. McCormick and Larrieu would compete for the goalkeeping position for the next season, with both playing 24 games each, even with McCormick going out loan for a month to League Two side Boston United.

Larrieu re-established himself in 2005–06, leaving McCormick to play just 3 games all season. McCormick got his chance as number 1 keeper again in 2006–07, when Larrieu was diagnosed with testicular cancer. McCormick again played over 40 games in all competitions, including in Argyle&#x27;s 1–0 defeat to Watford in the FA Cup Quarter-final.

For the following 2007–08 season, McCormick started as back-up to Larrieu, but got his chance as number 1 again when Larrieu was loaned out to Yeovil Town. After a 2–1 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday, McCormick lost his spot to the returning Larrieu, who played in a dozen games before falling ill to testicular cancer again, seeing McCormick become first choice once again. He received his first red card of his career in the 71st minute of a 1–0 defeat away to Scunthorpe United, for handling the ball outside his area. Defender Lee Hodges took over goalkeeping duties for the rest of the game, and emergency-loan signing Rab Douglas played the next game, before McCormick re-gained his place in the team, as Argyle went on to finish 10th in the Championship. A 1–0 defeat away to Wolverhampton Wanderers on 4 May 2008 would prove to be his final game for over four years. McCormick had played 157 games for Argyle, appearing as a substitute once.

===Car crash and conviction===
On 7 June 2008, McCormick was arrested by patrol units of the Central Motorway Police Group on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. McCormick&#x27;s Range Rover collided with a Toyota Previa at 5.45am between junctions 15 and 16 of the southbound M6 motorway, near Keele Services in Staffordshire. The crash resulted in the death of Arron and Ben Peak, aged ten and eight, from the Partington area of Manchester. Their father, Philip, the driver of the Previa, was taken to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire with fractures to the neck, back, ribs and swelling of the lungs.

The following day, McCormick was charged by Staffordshire Police with two counts of causing death by dangerous driving, driving with excess alcohol in his blood, and driving with no insurance. He appeared at Fenton Magistrates&#x27; Court on 9 June and was granted conditional bail until 16 June when he appeared at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court. At this hearing the charge of driving without insurance was dropped against McCormick and the case was adjourned until 8 September and subsequently to 6 October.

On 2 July 2008, McCormick was suspended by Plymouth Argyle, and his contract was cancelled by mutual consent on 22 July. He pleaded guilty to charges of causing death by dangerous driving and driving with excess alcohol, and received a sentence of seven years and four months&#x27; imprisonment and a four-year driving ban on 6 October. McCormick served time at both HM Prison Ranby and HM Prison Channings Wood before being released from HM Prison Leyhill on 6 June 2012.

===Post-prison career===
====Trials and Truro====
In May 2012, with his release from prison pending, Swindon Town announced their intention to offer McCormick a trial period, but they finished the trial in August 2012 without offering him a contract.

McCormick signed with Conference South club Truro City on a non-contract basis in November 2012 and made his debut against Farnborough in the FA Trophy on 10 November. Although in administration, Truro were permitted to sign a goalkeeper when their only other keeper, Tim Sandercombe, was injured.

====Oxford United====
McCormick played 11 times for Truro before he re-entered league football for the first time in four and a half years by signing for Oxford United of League Two on 31 January 2013, on a contract until the end of the 2012–13 season. He played 15 matches for Oxford, but lost his first team place to Max Crocombe by mid-April and he was released at the end of the season.

====Return to Argyle====
In May 2013, it was reported that McCormick was in talks to return to Plymouth Argyle, five years after his departure; on 9 May 2013 he re-signed for the club on a one-year contract. McCormick managed to establish himself as Argyle&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper ahead of Jake Cole until he fractured and dislocated a finger on his left hand in a 1–1 draw with Mansfield Town on 1 February 2014, which ruled him out for the rest of the season. Despite this setback, McCormick signed a new 2-year contract with the club at the end of the season.

McCormick was handed the role of club captain before the start of the 2014–15 season. The campaign was a strong one for McCormick, as he started all 53 league and cup matches, kept 22 clean sheets and won Argyle&#x27;s player of the year award. The club reached the League Two playoffs but fell to a 5–3 aggregate defeat to Wycombe Wanderers in the semi-final.

The 2015–16 season saw McCormick play all but six of Plymouth Argyle&#x27;s league games, conceding an average of 1 goal per game. He suffered an injury in mid-November and was deputised by James Bittner, and later Christian Walton, before finally making his return to the side on 19 December in a 2–1 away win against Hartlepool United. McCormick was later rested for the last league game of the season, Argyle&#x27;s home game vs Hartlepool, in which Vincent Dorel started in his place in a 5–0 win. Argyle reached the League Two playoffs once again, this time falling to a 2–0 defeat to AFC Wimbledon in the final at Wembley, with goals scored by Lyle Taylor and Adebayo Akinfenwa.

Following the Wembley defeat, captain Curtis Nelson left the club to join Oxford United, and so for the start of the 2016–17 season McCormick was handed the role of captain, meaning he&#x27;d wear the armband out on the pitch for the first time. Argyle made it to the third round of the 2016-17 FA Cup with a 1–0 replay win at Newport County, thanks to an extra time goal from Graham Carey, and drew Liverpool away from home. McCormick kept a clean sheet as Argyle drew 0–0, earning a replay. The replay was played at Home Park, in which, despite McCormick saving a Divock Origi penalty, Argyle lost 1–0.

McCormick was released by Plymouth at the end of the 2017–18 season.

====Swindon Town====
He joined League Two side Swindon Town in July 2018 after a successful trial. He signed a one-year contract. He made his debut on 7 August 2018 in a 4–0 defeat to Chelsea U23s in the EFL Trophy. When first-choice keeper Lawrence Vigouroux received a call-up for the Chile national football team, McCormick deputised, and kept his place when Vigouroux returned from international duty, after only conceding four goals in his first seven starts. Vigouroux eventually regained his place from McCormick in October, until 23 March when McCormick started in a 4–0 win against Morecambe, and played every game until the end of the season. He finished the 18–19 season playing 21 games, with 17 of those appearances coming in the league.

McCormick started the 19–20 season as first-choice, starting all 14 games in all competitions until a 2–1 defeat to Bradford City on 5 October 2019. Loan keeper Steven Benda then took over goalkeeping duties, leaving McCormick to only play one more game for the rest of the season: a 1–0 EFL Trophy defeat to Bristol Rovers.

Swindon Town were promoted as Champions of the 2019–20 EFL League Two on PPG, and McCormick was offered a new contract for the 2020–21 season.

====Third spell with Argyle====
Having rejected the offer of a contract extension at Swindon, on 28 July 2020, McCormick joined Plymouth Argyle for a third time. &quot;We feel Luke will provide good competition with Mike Cooper for the first-team position,&quot; said manager Ryan Lowe.

McCormick featured off of the subs bench for Argyle&#x27;s last two games of the 20–21 season, to make his 349th, and 350th appearances for the club. On 24 June 2021, it was revealed he had signed a new contract to remain at the club as an emergency &#x27;training goalkeeper&#x27;, with Mike Cooper and new signing Callum Burton taking the main first-team duties.

====Emergency loan to Truro====
On 2 November 2021, McCormick made a return to Truro City, this time on an emergency loan deal. He played in Truro&#x27;s 1–0 FA Trophy Qualifier win against Cirencester Town that day, replacing the suspended James Hamon.

====Retirement====
On 3 May 2022, McCormick&#x27;s retirement was announced in Plymouth&#x27;s retained list.

Ahead of the 2024-25 season, McCormick came out of retirement and was registered with Southern Football League side, Plymouth Parkway.

<doc id="447107" wikidata="Q6484792" url="?curid=447107" title="List of free economic zones">
<text>In special economic zones business and trades laws differ from the rest of the country. The term, and a number of other terms, can have different specific meanings in different countries and publications. Often they have relaxed jurisdiction of customs or related national regulations. They can be ports or other large areas or smaller allocated areas.

Terms include free port (porto Franco), free zone (zona franca), bonded area (US: foreign-trade zone), [[free economic zone]], [[free-trade zone]], export processing zone and [[maquiladora]].

Most commonly a free port is a special customs area or small customs territory with generally less strict customs regulations (or no customs duties or controls for transshipment). Earlier in history, some free ports like enjoyed political autonomy. Many international airports have free ports, though they tend to be called customs areas, customs zones, or international zones.

Although the enabling act came into effect in 1992, the pioneer Free Zone (the Calabar Free Trade Zone) was not fully completed until 1999, and commenced operation after official commissioning in November 2001. Since then, the Free Zones Scheme has been used as a vehicle for industrial and commercial development of the country. Private Sector participation and partnership with the Federal Government and other tiers of government has helped spread the scheme. This has culminated in the establishment of specialised Free Zones and other types of Zones, namely:

The introduction of free zones has played a large role in increasing the amount of investment into Nigeria. When all the free zones are fully operational, Nigeria is projected to play a large role in expanding export-driven manufacturing activities in Africa.

<doc id="447121" wikidata="Q2700651" url="?curid=447121" title="Melicope">
<text>Melicope is a genus of about 240 species of shrubs and trees in the family Rutaceae, occurring from the Hawaiian Islands across the Pacific Ocean to tropical Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Plants in the genus &quot;Melicope&quot; have simple or trifoliate leaves arranged in opposite pairs, flowers arranged in panicles, with four sepals, four petals and four or eight stamens and fruit composed of up to four follicles.

==Description==
Plants in the genus &quot;Melicope&quot; have simple or trifoliate leaves arranged in opposite pairs, or sometimes whorled.The flowers are arranged in panicles and are bisexual or sometimes with functionally male- or female-only flowers. The flowers have four sepals, four petals and four or eight stamens. There are four, sometimes five, carpels fused at the base with fused styles, the stigma similar to the tip of the style. The fruit is composed of up to four follicles fused at the base, each with one or two seeds.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Melicope&quot; was first formally described in 1775 by Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Georg Forster in their book &quot;Characteres Generum Plantarum&quot; and the first species they described (the type species) was &quot;Melicope ternata&quot;.

The generic name &quot;Melicope&quot; is derived from Greek words μελι (&quot;meli&quot;), meaning &quot;honey,&quot; and κοπη (&quot;kope&quot;), meaning &quot;a division,&quot; referring to the glands at the base of the ovary. The 2009 Takhtajan system placed the genus in the subfamily Rutoideae, tribe Zanthoxyleae. A 2021 subfamily classification of the Rutaceae, based both on a new and previous molecular phylogenetic studies, places &quot;Melicope&quot; (with an expanded circumscription) in the subfamily Zanthoxyloideae, stating that the evidence does not yet support classification to tribal level.

Evidence from 2007 onwards showed that with its traditional circumscription, &quot;Melicope&quot; was not monophyletic. The previously separated genus &quot;Platydesma&quot; of four species is nested within the genus &quot;Melicope&quot; and is sister to all Hawaiian &quot;Melicope&quot; species. And while &quot;Melicope&quot; species are usually dioecious (individual plants only bear either male or female flowers), the flowers of the former &quot;Platydesma&quot; are hermaphroditic, suggesting a rare evolutionary reversion away from dioecy in &quot;Platydesma&quot;. Molecular phylogenetic analyses also suggest that the genera &quot;Comptonella&quot;, &quot;Dutaillyea&quot;, &quot;Picrella&quot;, and possibly &quot;Dutailliopsis&quot;, all from New Caledonia, might also be nested in &quot;Melicope&quot;, although they are accepted in the 2021 classification, as is the temperate Asian genus &quot;Tetradium&quot;, which has sometimes been merged into &quot;Melicope&quot; (possibly including the tropical &quot;Euodia&quot;).

==Ecology==
Melicopes are foodplants for various animals, mainly invertebrates. Caterpillars of the Ulysses butterfly (&quot;Papilio ulysses&quot;) are fond of &quot;M. elleryana&quot;. Caterpillars of &quot;Thyrocopa&quot; moths have been found on &quot;M. clusiifolia&quot;. The larvae of some belid weevils from the genus &quot;Proterhinus&quot; also feed on &quot;Melicope&quot; although they prefer unhealthy, dying or dead specimens. The plants of some species may not be safe for humans. The nectar of wharangi (&quot;M. ternata&quot;) is known to yield toxic honey that may kill whoever eats it.

==Conservation==
Several of the Hawaiian species are listed as &quot;endangered&quot; by the Government of the United States of America, due to habitat loss and competition from invasive non-native plants. A few species are already extinct.

<text>Sorcerer is a 1977 American action-thriller film produced and directed by William Friedkin and starring Roy Scheider, Bruno Cremer, Francisco Rabal, and Amidou. The second adaptation of Georges Arnaud&#x27;s 1950 French novel &quot;Le Salaire de la peur&quot;, it is often considered a remake of the 1953 film &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot;, although Friedkin disagreed with this assessment. The film depicts four outcasts from varied backgrounds living in a South American village assigned to transport two trucks loaded with aged, poorly kept dynamite that is &quot;sweating&quot; its dangerous basic ingredient, nitroglycerin.

&quot;Sorcerer&quot; was originally conceived as a small-scale side project to Friedkin&#x27;s next major film, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Triangle&quot;, with a modest US$2.5 million budget. The director later opted for a more ambitious production, which he envisioned as his magnum opus. The cost of &quot;Sorcerer&quot; was earmarked at $15 million, escalating to $22 million following a grueling production with various filming locations—primarily in the Dominican Republic—and conflicts between Friedkin and his crew. The mounting expenses later required the involvement of two major film studios, Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures, with both studios sharing the U.S. distribution and Cinema International Corporation being responsible for the international release.

The film received generally negative reviews upon its initial release and became a box office bomb, its domestic (including rentals) and worldwide gross of $5.9 million and $9 million respectively did not recoup its costs. Many critics as well as Friedkin himself attributed the film&#x27;s commercial failure to its release at roughly the same time as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which instantly became a pop-culture phenomenon. However, the film has enjoyed a significant critical reappraisal in the decades following, with some critics lauding it as an overlooked masterpiece, and &quot;perhaps the last undeclared [one] of the American &#x27;70s&quot;. Friedkin considered &quot;Sorcerer&quot; among his favorite works, and the most personal and difficult film he ever made. Tangerine Dream&#x27;s electronic music score was also acclaimed, leading the band to become popular soundtrack composers in the 1980s.

After a lengthy lawsuit filed against Universal Studios and Paramount, Friedkin supervised a digital restoration of &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, with the new print premiering at the 70th Venice International Film Festival on August 29, 2013. Warner Home Video released the film remastered on Blu-ray on April 22, 2014.

== Plot ==
The film opens with a prologue that consists of four segments described by critics as &quot;vignettes&quot;. They show the principal characters in different parts of the world and provide their backstories.

=== Part I: Prologue ===

==== Vignette #1: Veracruz, Mexico ====
Nilo, an elegantly dressed man, enters a flat in Veracruz. Nilo immediately executes the unsuspecting tenant with a silenced revolver and proceeds to casually walk out of the building and onto the square.

==== Vignette #2: Jerusalem, Israel ====
A group of terrorists disguised as Jews cause an explosion near the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem, after which they take shelter at their hideout, where they assemble weaponry and plan their escape. After getting surrounded by the Israel Defense Forces, they split up; two are killed and one is apprehended. The only one who manages to escape is Kassem. The segment finishes as he helplessly stares from a crowd at his captured companion.

==== Vignette #3: Paris, France ====
While discussing a book his wife is editing, Victor Manzon discovers an anniversary gift from her: a watch with a special dedication. After meeting with the president of the Paris Stock Exchange, where he is accused of fraud, Victor is given 24 hours to provide collateral so the charges can be dropped. Victor meets his business partner and brother-in-law, Pascal, and they quarrel; Victor insists that Pascal contact his father for financial assistance. Victor dines with his wife and her friend in a glamorous restaurant; he later receives a message from a butler that Pascal is waiting outside. When he learns that Pascal&#x27;s father has refused to help, Victor is adamant that they try again. He walks his partner to a car, but Pascal commits suicide. Faced with impending doom, Victor leaves both his wife and the country.

==== Vignette #4: Elizabeth, New Jersey, US ====
In Elizabeth, an Irish gang robs a Catholic church that is connected with a rival Italian Mafia crew and organizes cash bingo games. During the robbery, one of the Irish-American gangsters shoots and wounds one of the priests counting the proceeds of the bingo. Back in their car, the Irish gang members engage in a heated argument that causes Jackie Scanlon, the driver, to lose concentration and collide with a truck. Everyone is killed but Jackie, who escapes with serious injuries. The wounded priest turns out to be the brother of Carlo Ricci, an Italian Mafia kingpin who also controlled the flow of money in the church and is determined to kill Jackie at all costs. Jackie meets with his friend Vinnie, who reveals his fate and finds a suitable place for him to escape. The only option Jackie has is to agree.

=== Part II: Life in Porvenir ===
Kassem, Victor, and Jackie all assume fake identities and end up in Porvenir, a remote village somewhere in South America. Its conditions are in stark contrast to their previous lives. The village economy is heavily reliant on an American oil company. Kassem befriends a man called &#x27;Marquez&#x27;, presumably a Nazi war criminal. They all live in extreme poverty and earn meager salaries. All want out, but their savings are inadequate for emigration. After some time, Nilo arrives in the village, raising suspicions. In the meantime, an oil well explodes, and the only way to extinguish the fire is to use dynamite. Since the only available dynamite has been improperly stored in a remote depot, the nitroglycerin contained inside has become highly unstable; the faintest vibration could cause an explosion. With all other means ruled out, the only way to transport it the 218 miles (351 km) is to use trucks. The company seeks four drivers to man two vehicles. Kassem, Victor, Jackie and &#x27;Marquez&#x27; are offered the job, but they have to assemble the trucks using scrap parts. Shortly before their departure, Nilo kills and replaces &#x27;Marquez&#x27;, which angers Kassem.

=== Part III: Journey ===
The four drivers embark upon a perilous journey of over , facing many hazards and internal conflicts. Despite their differences, they are forced to cooperate. They traverse a rotten bridge during a violent thunderstorm, Kassem and Victor nearly losing their truck in the process. The team is forced to use one of the boxes of dynamite to destroy a massive fallen tree blocking their path. The rough terrain on a cliff-side road causes Kassem and Victor&#x27;s truck to blow a tire, sending the truck over the cliff; it explodes and kills the pair. When Nilo and Jackie stop at the scene of the destruction, bandits surround them in an attempted robbery. They kill the bandits but Nilo is mortally wounded, soon dying from his injuries. Now alone, Jackie struggles to stay sane, overwhelmed by hallucinations and flashbacks. When his truck&#x27;s engine dies just two miles short of the destination, he is forced to carry the remaining dynamite on foot. Once he finally reaches his destination, he collapses from exhaustion.

=== Epilogue ===
At the bar back in Porvenir, Jackie is given a Colombian passport and payment for the job by the oil company, as well as an offer of another job. Before he leaves, he asks a charwoman for a dance. As the two dance, Carlo Ricci&#x27;s henchmen, along with Jackie&#x27;s old friend Vinnie, emerge from a taxi and walk into the bar wielding guns. From outside, the faint sound of either a single gunshot or a tire blowout is heard, leaving Jackie&#x27;s fate unknown.

== Cast ==
* Roy Scheider as Jackie Scanlon / Juan Dominguez, a driver who is marked for execution after his Irish-American gang robs a church and wounds a priest who is the brother of Carlo Ricci, a powerful Mafia crime boss now seeking vengeance. Some time after his escape to Porvenir, local authorities proved he was using a forged ID; as compensation they are taking one third of his daily wages. Moreover, they have proven that he does not speak Spanish. His appearance as an &quot;everyman&quot; is modeled after Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s Fred C. Dobbs character in &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;, with a &quot;battered hat, unshaven face and tough guy stance&quot;. Screenwriter Walon Green described him as &quot;believable, gutsy, and most important, desperately human&quot;. His characteristics are &quot;most likely to reflect the self-image of the spectator&quot;.
* Bruno Cremer as Victor Manzon / Serrano. Manzon was Cremer&#x27;s first English-speaking role, an investment banker from Paris whose firm, Preville &amp; Fils, is accused of false representation of collateral amounting to fifteen million francs. He speaks French, English, and German. Throughout the film, he &quot;assumes a take-charge attitude&quot; and stands for a &quot;voice of discipline and reason&quot; as well negotiates the salary with Corlette on behalf of Scanlon, Nilo and Kassem, demanding double what was originally offered, in concert with legal residence.
* Francisco Rabal as Nilo. This role was a Hollywood debut for Rabal. Nilo is an enigmatic Mexican professional assassin, skilled in using firearms, who speaks English and Spanish. His visit in Porvenir was meant to be a temporary one, as he was in transit; however, for reasons unknown he decided to stay there. He is the last-minute replacement for &quot;Marquez&quot; as one of the truck drivers. He is hated by Kassem and initially disliked by Scanlon. Despite having an occasion to star in a Hollywood movie, which was the actor&#x27;s dream, Rabal was slightly disappointed with the movie&#x27;s international scope and said, &quot;[All] my life, I wanted to make a &#x27;Hollywood&#x27; movie [and w]hen I finally did, it was filmed in Paris, Israel, Mexico and the Dominican Republic!&quot;
* Amidou as Kassem / Martinez, a politically motivated Arab bomber-terrorist with &quot;improvised engineering skills&quot;. His attitude is permeated by &quot;angry determination&quot; and he shows a strong dislike for Nilo.
* Ramon Bieri as Corlette, an oil company representative who seeks four experienced drivers to transport dynamite to extinguish a fire on a remote oil well. He believes the explosion was caused by local terrorists.
* Karl John as Marquez, an old German and former Nazi who is Kassem&#x27;s friend, wanting to help him to move abroad from Porvenir. He is initially chosen as one of the four drivers. &quot;Marquez&quot; was Karl John&#x27;s final role, as he died on December 22, 1977.

Other cast members include Peter Capell as Lartigue, Corlette&#x27;s superior; Anne-Marie Deschodt as Blanche, Victor Manzon&#x27;s wife, who gives him a specially engraved watch as a wedding anniversary gift, which later on Victor tries in vain to sell in exchange for a way out of Porvenir; Friedrich von Ledebur as Carlos, an owner of the El Corsario bar and a supposedly former &quot;Third Reich marshal;&quot; Chico Martinez as Bobby Del Rios, an explosives specialist and Corlette&#x27;s advisor who assesses the situation at the oil well; Joe Spinell as &quot;Spider&quot;, an acquaintance of Scanlon in Porvenir who takes part in the truck-driving test but fails; Rosario Almontes as Agrippa, a bar maid in El Corsario who seems to be fond of Manzon as she gives him a crucifix before his departure; Richard Holley as Billy White, a helicopter pilot who rules out shipping the dynamite by air; Jean-Luc Bideau as Pascal, Manzon&#x27;s brother-in-law who fails to receive help from his father to save their company from execution of fraud; Jacques François as Lefevre, the president of the Paris Stock Exchange, who accuses Manzon of money fraud; Gerard Murphy as Donnelly, a head of the Irish gang of which Jackie Scanlon is a member; Randy Jurgensen as Vinnie, a friend of Scanlon who directs him to the Baltimore docks from where he has to flee to a yet undisclosed location in order to evade execution from the Mafia; and Cosmo Allegretti as Carlo Ricci, a vengeful Mafia leader and a brother of a priest who was shot in New Jersey during the robbery who puts a bounty on the head of Jackie Scanlon.

== Title and themes ==

The film&#x27;s title refers to one of the trucks, which has the name &quot;Sorcerer&quot; painted across the hood (the other is named &quot;Lazaro&quot;); the narrative features no supernatural or magical character or event. As director William Friedkin went location scouting in Ecuador and researched the peculiar ornaments on cargo trucks he had seen there, he noticed there were names painted on them, which ranged from relatives to mythological references. Firstly he came up with the name &quot;Lazaro&quot; after Lazarus; then after some time struggling to find another moniker, a listen to the Miles Davis album &quot;Sorcerer&quot; served as an inspiration to name the other truck, though the word was painted in French: &quot;Sorcier&quot;. Friedkin then decided to change his working title &quot;Ballbreaker&quot; for &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, which he described as &quot;an intentional but ill-advised reference to &quot;The Exorcist&quot;&quot;.

Friedkin thought the title fit the film&#x27;s general theme:
Friedkin elaborated on this theme in an interview with Thomas D. Clagett: In the director&#x27;s opinion, the premise of &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; (both the novel and the first film adaptation) seemed to him a metaphor for &quot;the world [being] full of strangers who hated one another, but if they didn&#x27;t cooperate, if they didn&#x27;t work together in some way, they would blow up.&quot; Walon Green, the screenwriter, said that he and Friedkin &quot;wanted a cynical movie where fate turns the corner for the people before they turn it themselves&quot;. Additionally, their intention was to &quot;write a real movie about what we thought was the reality of Latin America and the presence of foreigners there today&quot;.

During a scene in Paris involving a conversation between Victor and his wife, she reads him a memoir of a retired French Foreign Legion officer who has to make a decision whether to kill a civilian or not. The officer eventually does so, which to Victor means that he was &quot;just another soldier&quot;. His wife, counters with an argument that &quot;no one is just anything&quot;. For Friedkin, this phrase stands for &quot;the theme of the film&quot;. Film critic Gloria Heifetz has added that Friedkin&#x27;s direction prevents this line from becoming sentimental, and ties in with the film&#x27;s finale.

== Production ==

=== Pre-development ===
Friedkin originally conceived &quot;Sorcerer&quot; as a &quot;little 2.5 million in-between movie&quot;, a stepping stone to realize his next major project, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Triangle&quot;, the planned follow-up to &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. However, Steven Spielberg at that point had already made &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, which presumably nullified the project. Peter Biskind theorized that Friedkin had always seen Francis Ford Coppola as his competitor, so when Coppola headed to the Philippines to direct &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, Friedkin went to Latin America to shoot &quot;Sorcerer&quot;.

Friedkin&#x27;s intention was not to create a remake, but to direct a film using only the same basic outline with completely original protagonists. He also wanted the film to be &quot;grittier than Clouzot&#x27;s [version], with the &#x27;documentary feel&#x27; for which [he] had become known.&quot; Friedkin initially also wanted to get Clouzot&#x27;s &quot;Wages of Fear&quot; re-released in American theaters but could not convince any major studio to do so. He felt that American audiences had very limited exposure to Clouzot&#x27;s film and that the English-speaking world in general was not very familiar with it.

==== Writing and influences ====
Friedkin appointed Walon Green as the film&#x27;s screenwriter. The director got to know Green in the 1960s, and was since highly impressed with his work in Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s western &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;. Friedkin described Green as a multilingual person, fluently speaking French, Spanish, Italian, and German, as well as having &quot;an encyclopedic knowledge of classical music and literature&quot;. Prior to writing the script, Green expressed enthusiasm about the project and suggested Friedkin read Gabriel García Márquez&#x27;s novel &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;. Friedkin described it as &quot;another lifechanging work&quot; which served as a workprint for their adaptation of &quot;Wages of Fear&quot;. The story outline was created by both Friedkin and Green, and the script was finished in four months. Gerard Murphy, who portrayed the head of the Irish gang during the Elizabeth church robbery, was a real-life criminal involved in a similar heist. Friedkin utilized details from Murphy&#x27;s stories and used them as an inspiration. The remaining members of the gang were &quot;nonactors but part of Gerry&#x27;s world&quot;, including one IRA member.

Some reviewers likened certain elements of the film to Werner Herzog&#x27;s 1972 movie &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot;, such as Alex Peterson, who thought both movies are notable for their &quot;ability to create a truly threatening atmosphere out of a lush jungle location, and for asking the dubiously pertinent question of what greed and crazy determination might bring to men.&quot; This connection was explored further in Friedkin&#x27;s 2013 memoir, &quot;The Friedkin Connection&quot;, when the director likened himself to a character from another Herzog movie; in the process of making the film, he &quot;had become like Fitzcarraldo, the man who built an opera house in the Brazilian jungle.&quot;

Several critics compared the movie to John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;. Phil Mucci indicated a similarity in terms of the premise as a &quot;tale of desperate men in desperate times, bound together by fate and circumstance,&quot; and Thomas D. Clagett likened Jackie Scanlon&#x27;s characteristics and appearance to Fred C. Dobbs (played by Humphrey Bogart) from Huston&#x27;s movie. According to Clagett, who cites Friedkin, this was intentional. Phil Mucci notes the visual influence of French New Wave, as well as Gillo Pontecorvo&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot;, the latter comment also mirrored by Shaun Crawford, Tom Stempel in his book &quot;Framework: A History of Screenwriting in the American Film&quot;, and Ken Dancyger in &quot;The Technique of Film and Video Editing: History, Theory, and Practice&quot;, where he states that by employing similar techniques to Pontecorvo, in the prologues he &quot;establish[es] credibility&quot; as well as makes &quot;[these] histories as realistic as possible.&quot; Stempel additionally alluded the film&#x27;s episodic structure to Robert Altman&#x27;s work. Crawford also observes that the film possesses &quot;cinema verite sensibilities&quot;, which in his opinion allow the director to capture &quot;its grimy realism&quot;. Dancynger also touches upon this thread and assesses the Jerusalem prologue sequence as shot entirely in &quot;cinema verite fashion&quot;.

==== Obtaining the license ====
Before the actual production could take place, William Friedkin had to resolve the problem with licensing, because Henri-Georges Clouzot did not own the rights for the intellectual property. It was owned by the novelist Georges Arnaud:

Upon Friedkin revealing his intentions to Clouzot, Clouzot was surprised Friedkin wanted to reimagine &quot;Wages of Fear&quot; because of enormous praise he had received at the time for his two recent pictures. Friedkin offered Clouzot a percentage of the film&#x27;s shares, for which the French director was thankful. In 2013, after a screening of &quot;Sorcerer&quot; at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Friedkin mentioned that he &quot;went to Georges Arnaud&#x27;s home through his attorney, and he was very pleased to have this done because he didn&#x27;t like Clouzot&#x27;s film, if you can believe that&quot;.

==== Casting ====
Friedkin originally envisioned an all-star cast of Steve McQueen, Marcello Mastroianni, and Lino Ventura.

McQueen was the director&#x27;s first choice for Jackie Scanlon, a small-time criminal who ends up a fugitive from the law and the Mafia after a robbery of a New Jersey church. Scanlon&#x27;s role was written specifically for McQueen after Friedkin met him in person and he turned out to be very keen on the idea. McQueen loved the script, and even went as far as to say &quot;This is the best script I&#x27;ve ever read&quot;, but did not want to leave the country or wife Ali MacGraw at the time. Instead, he proposed that MacGraw become an associate producer or that a part be written for her in the film; however, Friedkin declined both his wishes, stating that &quot;there&#x27;s hardly a major role as a woman…and we don&#x27;t have associate producers who don&#x27;t do anything, we&#x27;re not going to make her an AP.&quot; It eventually led to McQueen&#x27;s declining the offer, upsetting the director greatly, and making him later regret this decision.

After the disagreement with McQueen, Friedkin approached Robert Mitchum who, despite appreciating the script, sternly declined, asking Friedkin &quot;Why would I want to go to Ecuador for two or three months to fall out of a truck? I can do that outside my house.&quot; The role was then offered to Clint Eastwood and Jack Nicholson, neither of whom was willing to travel to the Dominican Republic. Another candidate for Scanlon&#x27;s role was Warren Oates, but once the movie&#x27;s budget escalated beyond $10 million, the studio decided that &quot;[his] name wasn&#x27;t big enough to carry that big a picture.&quot; They eventually worked together on Friedkin&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, titled &quot;The Brink&#x27;s Job&quot;.

Marcello Mastroianni was offered the role of Nilo, which he initially accepted, but due to problems related to his daughter&#x27;s custody after his separation from Catherine Deneuve, he ultimately declined the director&#x27;s offer. He was replaced by Spanish actor Francisco Rabal, whom Friedkin had wanted for the role of &quot;Frog One&quot; in &quot;The French Connection&quot; because he loved his performance in Luis Buñuel&#x27;s &quot;Belle de Jour&quot;, but the casting director mistakenly got Fernando Rey instead.

Manzon&#x27;s role was intended for one of the most prominent European actors, Lino Ventura. Despite Ventura&#x27;s concerns about his English, he initially accepted Friedkin&#x27;s proposal. However, after McQueen backed out, Ventura was hesitant to take part in the movie.

It was not until Universal executive Sidney Sheinberg suggested Roy Scheider that Friedkin managed to cast the leading role of Jackie Scanlon. They had previously worked on &quot;The French Connection&quot; together, but had lost contact after Friedkin—at William Peter Blatty&#x27;s insistence—refused to cast Scheider as Father Karras in &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. With Universal unenthusiastic about the project, acquiring Scheider, who had recently enjoyed enormous success in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot;, increased the studio&#x27;s confidence. Production notes on the 1998 Universal DVD release tell a different story, noting that the casting of Scheider as Scanlon/Dominguez was a &quot;foregone conclusion&quot; and &quot;the ideal (perhaps the only) choice for the role&quot; since Friedkin had directed him previously in &quot;The French Connection&quot;.

After casting Scheider in the main role, Lino Ventura refused to take second billing to him. The actor was replaced by Bruno Cremer, who, among other pictures prior to &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, had played in Costa-Gavras&#x27;s &quot;Section spéciale&quot; and whom Friedkin described as a &quot;good actor&quot;.

The only actor who was Friedkin&#x27;s original choice was the French-Moroccan Amidou, who played the Palestinian terrorist, Kassem. Friedkin was so impressed with his performance in Claude Lelouch&#x27;s &quot;La Vie, l&#x27;amour, la mort&quot; (released in 1968) that he wrote down his name immediately upon seeing the movie, expecting to collaborate with him one day.

Friedkin overall felt dissatisfied with the casting process. He felt &quot;Sorcerer&quot; &quot;needed stars&quot; and claimed that the actors hired for the roles of Scanlon and Manzon were his fifth, sixth or seventh preferred choices. Rabal, however, was his &quot;about second or third choice&quot;. Despite liking Cremer, Friedkin felt that this role would benefit from the presence of Jean-Paul Belmondo or Lino Ventura. The abundance of foreign actors on the cast list prompted Sidney Sheinberg to ask the director whether he would like them to have Anglicized pseudonyms.

=== Characterization and design ===

According to Friedkin cited by Kachmar, his artistic intent was to shoot the entire film without &quot;sentiment&quot; or &quot;melodrama&quot;, rendering it completely devoid of &quot;heartfelt moments&quot;. Friedkin&#x27;s oeuvre has been frequently noted by critics for its lack of &quot;clear-cut heroes or villains&quot;, and the director himself admitted that he believes in neither. Thus, he envisioned all four principal characters to be anti-heroes and &quot;hard to &#x27;root for&#x27;&quot;. Friedkin felt very confident about himself at the time, thinking he was &quot;bulletproof [and] nothing was going to stop [him]&quot;, and felt he &quot;could take an audience through this with not the most likable people on Earth.&quot; The director also stated that the line &quot;action is character&quot; from F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; served as an inspiration for him in all the movies he made, including &quot;Sorcerer&quot;.

Serdar Yegulalp notes distinctive characteristics and traits of each of the protagonists and praises Friedkin&#x27;s execution by saying that the film &quot;never falls into the trap of having each character shine on cue: they only do their thing when they’re backed up against the abyss, much as we all do in the real world&quot; and adding that &quot;their desperation&#x27;s not a pose&quot;.

Prior to the post-production process, the movie contained a significantly larger amount of dialogue, and a detailed analysis of the European and American cuts reveals that certain scenes involving the relationship between Scanlon and Nilo, as well as presenting some of Nilo&#x27;s motives, were removed.

Unlike &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot;, in which the main characters were given two trucks in mint condition by the oil company, their counterparts depicted in &quot;Sorcerer&quot; had to be assembled by the protagonists themselves, using parts salvaged from wrecks. The production got two GMC -ton capacity M211 military trucks, first deployed in 1952 during the Korean War as transport trucks. Using the knowledge gained from the visits to Ecuador, Friedkin employed a Dominican artisan in order to embellish the vehicles with symbols and paintings based on the names &quot;Lazaro&quot; and &quot;Sorcerer&quot;.

=== Filming ===
Friedkin chose Dick Bush as his director of photography after seeing the film version of the rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot;, directed by Ken Russell, and after finding out that Bush had filmed Gustav Mahler&#x27;s biography as well as collaborated with Lindsay Anderson, whom Friedkin regarded highly. Scheider&#x27;s then-wife, Cynthia Scheider, was an assistant film editor who had previously worked with Bud Smith on &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. Since shooting the film required a prolonged stay in South America, Scheider asked Friedkin if she could stay with him and have a job in an editing capacity. The director fulfilled his wish and was reportedly &quot;delighted&quot;. &quot;Sorcerer&quot; was filmed during a ten-month production schedule, using approximately 1,200 camera set-ups. The director attempted to complete the picture &quot;without relying on dialogue&quot;, and &quot;telling the story through imagery&quot; instead. In the film&#x27;s pressbook Friedkin states that for him creating a film is multi-faceted experience: &quot;[e]very film is actually three films[.] There is the film you conceive and plan. There is the film you actually shoot. And there is the film that emerges with you in the editing room&quot;.

Principal photography commenced on location in Paris and depicted Victor Manzon&#x27;s backstory. The sequence filmed in Jerusalem was realized with cooperation of Israeli security forces who portrayed themselves in the pursuit scenes. The mock explosion that occurred during the Jerusalem scenes had such power that it broke a window of the city&#x27;s mayor&#x27;s house, which was located away. The detonation was controlled by Nick Dimitri, a stuntman portraying an Israeli soldier, who positioned himself too close to explosives which resulted in injuries. However, after an hour the director ordered a second take, being adamant about the previous accident. Dimitri praised Friedkin&#x27;s craftmanship by saying that &quot;when you watch the movie and everything gets obliterated, you can&#x27;t even tell if it&#x27;s the first or second take&quot;. Moreover, during the realization of the sequence, an actual bombing took place in the vicinity, which prompted Friedkin to capture additional footage which in his opinion added &quot;a documentary reality&quot;. The fourth prologue vignette, taking place in Elizabeth, New Jersey, contains a scene involving a car crash. It took twelve takes and approximately ten days to achieve what Friedkin intended. The director recalls the sequence as seemingly &quot;impossible to shoot&quot;, having involved several stuntmen from New York, the crew wrecked seven vehicles over the course of a week, without satisfying the director&#x27;s intents. Friedkin then put himself in the passenger seat to evaluate the negative aspects of the scene&#x27;s execution. The director became fed up with the situation and decided to listen to David Salven, the line producer, who suggested that they employ a well-known specialist, Joie Chitwood Jr., whom Friedkin described as &quot;short, stocky, part Indian, self-assured, and fearless&quot;. After Friedkin supplied him with all the necessary information about the set&#x27;s infrastracture, Chitwood meticulously analyzed the surroundings himself, and ordered the special effects technicians to construct a forty-feet long slanted ramp which would allow him to &quot;drive the car at top speed on two wheels, flip it in midair, and crash into a fire hydrant&quot;. The construction took three days, and the stunt was successful during its very first take.

Friedkin said the most important scene in the film was &quot;the bridge-crossing sequence, wherein the two trucks have to separately cross an old wooden suspension bridge that appears completely unstable&quot;. He also deemed it the most arduous scene he has ever filmed. The bridge was designed by John Box using carefully hidden hydraulic components allowing control of the movements of the bridge and the trucks alike. Its first iteration was constructed in the Dominican Republic over a period of three months, and it required $1 million to complete. However, as soon as it was finished, Friedkin&#x27;s crew faced a problem of abnormally low rainfall. During the construction process, the river&#x27;s water level decreased dramatically, and by the time the bridge was assembled, the river had become completely dry, despite the assurance of local engineers that there had not been any recorded fluctuations in water level during the dry season. Studio executives suggested Friedkin devise a less sophisticated scene, but instead he continued to realize his vision in different locations. Thus, John Box went to scout locations in Mexico and found that the Papaloapan River possessed similar characteristics. The previously constructed bridge had to be disassembled and re-anchored. Friedkin&#x27;s crew&#x27;s arrival caused a major disturbance in the vicinity among the locals because of his reputation as a director of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. However, a part of the population offered help to finish the structure. Ultimately, this river also became stricken with drought, which forced the application of some practical effects to complete the scene. In order to create artificial rain, Friedkin employed sewage pumps draining water from the river and diverting it to a sprinkler system. This scene alone, which lasts 12 minutes, took several months to complete and cost approximately three million dollars. The director has claimed that during this sequence, the truck teetering against the ropes actually tipped over into the river several times, causing numerous retakes.

The stunt coordinator for the film was Bud Ekins, who was Steve McQueen&#x27;s stunt double in &quot;The Great Escape&quot;. He was friends with the film editor, Bud Smith, who recalls Ekins being &quot;as cool as cucumber&quot;. In some cases stuntmen were employed throughout the making of the film but generally speaking the principal actors acted as their own doubles and were actual truck drivers. For instance, since Roy Scheider&#x27;s character Jackie Scanlon was meant to be a mob&#x27;s wheelman, he had to undertake a special preparation for maneuvering a vintage truck with the purpose of gaining the necessary driving skills. He summarized the experience as &quot;rehearsing to stay alive&quot;. Scheider has emphasized that no rear-screen projection or any other kinds of &quot;trick photography&quot; were used, due to the distance between the cameras, the vehicles and the surrounding terrain. In a 1977 interview for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Scheider said that shooting &quot;Sorcerer&quot; &quot;made &quot;Jaws&quot; look like a picnic.&quot; He mentioned that the stuntmen were unhappy because of the fact the leading actors performed their own stunts, and added that the scene involving crossing a suspension rope bridge is &quot;what really happened&quot;. Scheider called it the most perilous sequence he has ever taken part in. Amidou, in an interview for the &quot;Morocco Times&quot; in 2005, stated that out of all movies in his oeuvre, &quot;Sorcerer&quot; left the most lasting impression on him since he &quot;refused to have a substitute and paid for it physically.&quot;

Friedkin antagonized Paramount, using a Gulf and Western corporate photo for a scene that featured the evil board of directors of the fictional company which hired the men to deliver dynamite. Walon Green recalled the experience in the following way:

==== Locations ====

To create four prologues for the characters&#x27; respective backstories, Friedkin shot each of the vignettes on location, respectively in Paris for Victor Manzon, Jerusalem for Kassem, Elizabeth, New Jersey, for Jackie Scanlon, and Veracruz, Mexico, for Nilo. The main part of the film was, on the other hand, originally meant to be shot in Ecuador, which impressed Friedkin tremendously. However, such a diversity of locations caused serious concerns about the budget. After strong opposition from Lew Wasserman, who was the owner of Universal Studios at the time, Friedkin had to opt out from shooting there. The director eventually settled on the Dominican Republic, after receiving a green light from the studio&#x27;s executives. In a memoir, &quot;Infamous Players: A Tale of Movies, the Mob (And Sex)&quot;, film producer Peter Bart theorized that the owner of Gulf and Western, Charlie Bluhdorn, supported the Dominican Republic financially and intended to create a film-making centre there. Paul Rowlands, a critic, stated that &quot;it&#x27;s likely the decision to film in the Dominican Republic was one favoured by Bluhdorn.&quot;

After scouting locations with Walon Green and John Box, the production designer, they chose Villa Altagracia as the main location. Friedkin described the place as &quot;a prison without walls&quot; with a &quot;sense of timeless poverty and persecution&quot;.
Although the majority of the film was filmed in the Dominican Republic, Friedkin did not hesitate to look for other locales to achieve the desired effect. One of the most notable ones is depicted in the film&#x27;s climax. It features a surrealistic landscape on Navajo Nation lands in the Bisti/De-Na-Zin Wilderness, New Mexico:

==== On-set conflicts and problems ====
During a sequence involving the detonation of an enormous kaoba tree, Friedkin was faced with a problem of inadequate explosive power. Initially, Marcel Vercoutere, a special effects man who previously worked with the director on &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, was to be responsible for the explosion. However, it did not achieve the required effect and barely damaged the tree. This prompted Friedkin to reach for the services of an arsonist hailing from Queens, New York, going by the pseudonym &quot;Marvin the Torch&quot;, who arrived at the Dominican Republic three days after the call and utilizing flammable materials obliterated the tree in one take the following morning. A week into the shooting in the Dominican Republic, Friedkin and his crew went to Los Angeles to process the film and view dailies. The director described the prologues as &quot;beautifully shot&quot;, but he was dissatisfied with the jungle scenes which he deemed &quot;underexposed&quot; and &quot;dark&quot;. He told Dick Bush a reshoot would be necessary. Bush, on the other hand, argued that filming should have taken place on a stage where he could have adequately adjusted the lighting. The response reminded Friedkin of his previous problems on the set of &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot; and offended him, as from the very beginning he had wanted to shoot the entire film on location. Upon seeing the underexposed scenes, Bush reportedly &quot;lost confidence&quot; and was subsequently dismissed, which forced Friedkin to employ a new camera crew. He replaced Bush with John M. Stephens with whom he had worked under David L. Wolper. Stephens applied necessary changes, including the employment of reflectors balancing &quot;the deep shadows of the tall trees&quot;, as well as replacing lenses and film stock. This resulted in a leap of cinematographic quality which delighted the director, who has said &quot;the locations looked beautiful to the eye&quot;.

Apart from Bush, Friedkin had a feud with the chief Teamsters representative whom he dismissed at some point and which prompted the director to find another trucker crew. The director also fired five production managers, which upset Scheider, who said that he was &quot;tired of going to the airport and saying goodbye to them,&quot; as well as adding that he was the only person Friedkin could not drop, as he was the leading actor. David Salven, initially chosen as a line producer, had to quit for personal reasons, as he was facing the possibility of a divorce. Friedkin regretted this situation, as he praised Salven greatly for his previous contributions to his movies. He was replaced by Ian Smith, whom the director described as &quot;experienced and efficient&quot;. In Tuxtepec, Mexico, where the suspension bridge scene was filmed, an undercover federal agent informed Friedkin that several of his crew members, including grip crew men, stuntmen and a makeup artist, were in the possession of drugs and were urged to leave the country or face prison sentences. It reportedly took two weeks to replace the crew workers. Besides internal on-set conflicts, Friedkin, cited by Mucci, said that approximately fifty people &quot;had to leave the film for either injury or gangrene,&quot; as well as food poisoning and malaria. In &quot;The Friedkin Connection&quot; he added that &quot;almost half the crew went into the hospital or had to be sent home.&quot; Friedkin himself lost fifty pounds () and was stricken with malaria, which was diagnosed after the film&#x27;s premiere. Tim Applegate concluded an account of the troubled film-making of &quot;Sorcerer&quot; by comparing Friedkin to Francis Ford Coppola during the production of &quot;Apocalypse Now:&quot; &quot;Friedkin took his camera crew to the jungle and never quite returned.&quot;

During the shooting of the film in Villa Altagracia, a lawsuit was filed against Cinema Dominica (a subsidiary of Gulf and Western) by Dominican businessmen for alleged damages. The newspaper El Caribe said that the lawsuit against Cinema Dominica charged that the company had “failed to comply with the rental contract it signed for use of the town&#x27;s commercial locations.”

Friedkin recalls working with Scheider as difficult, stating the actor had frequent mood swings which did not occur during the filming of &quot;The French Connection&quot; and theorized that after achieving stardom with &quot;Jaws&quot; he became &quot;difficult&quot;, which contrasted with his attitude from &quot;The French Connection&quot;, where he &quot;would&#x27;ve down in front of an elevated train&quot; for Friedkin. The director stated Scheider at times was &quot;impossible to talk to&quot; and completely indifferent towards any of his suggestions. He summarized the experience by saying the arduous production schedule and difficult conditions in the Dominican Republic were most likely the reasons behind their difficult relationship. Likewise, Scheider also had his reservations about the work with Friedkin, on the one hand praising him as &quot;extraordinarily gifted filmmaker, who told stories with pictures and shot beautifully&quot; but despite his erudition, he was marred with distrusting attitude which made everyone around him very tense. According to Diane Kachmar, Friedkin believed that he inspired others to achieve great results, but Scheider did not favor such working conditions. However, Scheider also admitted that only a director of Friedkin&#x27;s stature could have persuaded him to perform all the life-threatening scenes he did, and added that upon seeing the dailies he &quot;knew it was worth it&quot;. Despite the mutual tensions, the director rated Scheider highly, did not hold any grudges, and regretted he did not receive more recognition for his body of work. However, their relationship eventually &quot;drifted apart&quot;.

=== Sound ===
The sound design crew included Jean-Louis Ducarme, with whom Friedkin had worked on &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and of whom he thought very highly. He was joined by Robert Knudson, who also was a sound effects supervisor for Friedkin&#x27;s previous movie as well as Robert Glass and Richard Tyler. The sound crew employed distorted samples of tiger and cougar roars for the truck engines&#x27; sound. C.J. Schexnayder noted that such a technical exercise was &quot;relatively unique for the period&quot;; but, over the years, techniques such as these became a staple of film-making. The sound design eventually garnered the movie&#x27;s sole Academy Award nomination, which it lost to &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

== Music ==
&quot;Sorcerer&quot; marked the first Hollywood film score for the German krautrock and electronic band Tangerine Dream. William Friedkin, during his visit in Germany, attended their concert in a derelict church in the Black Forest. The band seemed to him &quot;on the cutting edge of the electronic synthesizer sound&quot; that soon would become a staple in mainstream culture. He assessed their music as a mixture of classical music played on synthesizers and &quot;the new pop sound&quot;, and described the experience as &quot;mesmerizing&quot;. In an interview for Evolution Garden Music Award, Edgar Froese, then-band leader, recalled how he initially rejected the commission, thinking that Friedkin would score &quot;The Exorcist II&quot;, about which Froese was not enthusiastic. However, upon learning Friedkin intended to reimagine &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot;, Froese called Friedkin back and asked for video material to be worked on, but Friedkin suggested the band create the score based solely on their impressions of the script, without seeing a single minute of video footage. After initially meeting in Paris, Froese reports Friedkin was delighted with their work; Froese added that they &quot;never had to change anything on that score&quot; and summarized their involvement as &quot;the most uncomplicated work we did for Hollywood&quot;. Upon receiving the commissioned audio material, Friedkin was inspired to edit the film according to the music, which he received in a raw, unabridged form.

Friedkin, an admirer of the band, stated in the liner notes for the soundtrack that &quot;[h]ad [he] heard them sooner [he] would have asked them to score [&quot;The Exorcist&quot;]&quot;, and that he considers the film and the score to be &quot;inseparable&quot;. Apart from Tangerine Dream&#x27;s score, some excerpts from Keith Jarrett&#x27;s &quot;Hymns/Spheres&quot; were employed. Friedkin also featured one licensed song, &quot;I&#x27;ll Remember April&quot;, by jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker, and a cover version of &quot;So What&quot; by Miles Davis. For the film&#x27;s screening, Paramount and William Friedkin prepared specific instructions regarding music: they demanded a three-and-half-minute musical overture to be played prior to each screening, and prohibited any alterations to it.

In 2019, the soundtrack was released on green vinyl by Waxwork Records. It included the complete score by Tangerine Dream and liner notes by William Friedkin.

== Release ==
=== Box office ===
Paramount Pictures and Universal Pictures reached an agreement in which Paramount would distribute the film in the eastern United States while Universal would distribute the film in the western United States&quot;.&quot; &quot;Sorcerer&quot; opened theatrically in the United States on June 24, 1977, and ended up being a box office flop, grossing $5.9 million domestically and $9 million worldwide. Roger Ebert estimated that at the time, the film would have needed a gross of around $45–50m to just &quot;break even&quot;. It was released a month after George Lucas&#x27;s runaway box-office smash of 1977, &quot;Star Wars&quot;; Mann Theatres wanted to keep &quot;Star Wars&quot; at Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theater, but Paramount insisted on the company fulfilling its contract for &quot;Sorcerer&quot;. Warned by &quot;Sorcerer&quot; film editor Bud Smith, Friedkin and his wife Jeanne Moreau watched the science-fiction epic at Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theater and nervously saw the gigantic crowds that attended, knowing that his film would soon replace it. Friedkin&#x27;s fears were correct; when &quot;Sorcerer&quot; debuted at the theater, it was so unsuccessful by comparison that &quot;Star Wars&quot; quickly returned. Friedkin agreed with this assessment during an interview on the &quot;Bug&quot; DVD.

Several critics theorized that another probable factor in the film&#x27;s box office failure was the confusion related to its title. Cyriaque Lamar of Cracked.com notes that &quot;[a]udiences expecting mystical weirdness a la &quot;The Exorcist&quot; walked out of theaters[, prompting] ads that Sorcerer was &#x27;NOT A FILM ABOUT THE SUPERNATURAL&#x27;.&quot; Film critic Gene Siskel thought &quot;Sorcerer&quot; was a &quot;very bad title&quot;. To him the title might have indicated a certain likeness to &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and thought the audiences at the time were either bored with yet another film about exorcisms or that was precisely what they wanted and upon seeing the movie, they got confused, asking themselves &quot;where&#x27;s the devil?&quot; Siskel also thought each of the production companies would think the other one would handle the promotion, and nobody perceived it as a &quot;sole project of their own, it was dropped in-between them.&quot; On the other hand, Roger Ebert expressed his disappointment about the movie&#x27;s box office performance by saying that &quot;you could make more than that just by opening in the first week, people stumbling into a wrong theater looking for Bruce Lee,&quot; as well as blamed Universal and Paramount for the lack of support. Friedkin stated that his attitude throughout the making of the film &quot;alienated the top management of two studios&quot;, and as a consequence they did not feel compelled to support it.

Furthermore, the opening sixteen minutes contain no English language, which made the audiences think that it was a foreign subtitled film, and caused walk-outs. This prompted movie theatres to put a disclaimer on lobby cards asserting that for the most part, it was an English-language film.

After the film&#x27;s poor reception, its financial disaster prompted Universal executives to void their contract with Friedkin immediately. Friedkin moved to France with Moreau where he recuperated from a malaria infection contracted during the filming, and wanted to sever ties with American film industry. Despite &quot;Sorcerer&quot;″s failure, in a 2013 interview for &quot;The National&quot;, Friedkin stated that in retrospect he never stopped believing in the movie: &quot;I measure the success or failure of a film on one thing – how close I came to my vision of it.&quot;

=== Critical reception ===

==== Initial reception ====
&quot;Sorcerer&quot; was not received as well by the public or film critics as Friedkin&#x27;s previous two films had been. American movie reviewer D. K. Holm hinted that all criticisms might have stemmed from the very fact that Friedkin even dared to reimagine a French classic.

In Leonard Maltin&#x27;s annual &quot;Movie Guide&quot; ratings book, the film receives only two-and-a-half out of four stars, with the critique, &quot;Expensive remake of &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; never really catches hold despite a few astounding scenes.&quot; In Leslie Halliwell&#x27;s &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot;, the evaluation is even more harsh, and the author found the film &quot;truly insulting&quot;, going as far as to say: &quot;Why anyone would want to spend 20 million dollars on a remake of &quot;The Wages of Fear,&quot; do it badly, and give it a misleading title is anybody&#x27;s guess. The result is dire.&quot; Andrew Sarris in his July 18, 1977, review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; summarized the film as &quot;a visual and aural textbook on everything that is wrong with current movies,&quot; as well as stating that the movie reset Friedkin&#x27;s status to the beginning of his career, and compared him unfavourably to Clouzot, John Huston and David Lean, declaring that &quot;he has not come close to matching their craftsmanship.&quot; Robert C. Cumbow in the September 1977 issue of &quot;Movietone News&quot; also panned the film, criticizing camera placement as &quot;faulty&quot;, which in his opinion led to substandard exposition. Moreover, he also deemed the film&#x27;s editing &quot;ridiculous&quot; and thought &quot;Sorcerer&quot; lacked character involvement. John Marlowe of &quot;The Miami News&quot; assessed the movie&#x27;s dialogues unfavourably, stating that &quot;&quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s&quot; dialog is kept to such a minimum that not only you don&#x27;t feel for these four losers, but you never really get to know them.&quot; He also considered the film&#x27;s mixture of realist and surrealist moments as &quot;pain in the mind&quot;. Peter Biskind described the film as &quot;self-consciously arty and pretentious [...] fatally trapped between America and Europe, commerce and art,&quot; claiming the result represented &quot;the worst of both worlds&quot;, as well as noting that the audience of the time was strikingly different from the one that adored &quot;The French Connection&quot;. &quot;Films Illustrated&quot; summarized &quot;Sorcerer&quot; as &quot;below the usual par&quot;, in spite of the involvement of reputable lead actor Scheider and a &quot;topnotch director&quot;, Friedkin. In the August 1997 issue of &quot;The Progressive&quot;, Kenneth Turan praised the movie&#x27;s narrative set-up; however, he thought that in spite of it, it was impossible to attach oneself to the characters. He concluded the review by saying that with &quot;films like this, feeling is everything&quot;. One complaint was that some of the scene cuts were too abrupt. Gene Siskel claimed that the characters &quot;seem to be a little cold&quot;, as well as expressing an opinion that the special effects overpowered the protagonists.

John Simon wrote of how Friedkin &#x27;spent twenty-one million dollars to perpetrate a film that could be usefully studied in courses on how not to make movies&#x27;.

James Monaco praised the cinematography and craftsmanship, and stated that &quot;Friedkin has a commitment to this story&quot;, but concluded that &quot;somehow technique overwhelms meaning and emotion&quot;. Furthermore, he described the picture as &quot;more restrained&quot; than Friedkin&#x27;s earlier work, as well as calling it &quot;a grandly naive gesture of self-indulgence,&quot; and trivialized his effort to a mere attempt at remaking &quot;his hero Clouzot&quot;.

David Badder, in &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;, was of the opinion that even if the film had been truncated, it would not improve its quality. He described &quot;Sorcerer&quot; as &quot;remarkably lacklustre&quot;, and did not appreciate the unstable tone of the movie which he called &quot;impenetrably obscure&quot;. Additionally, he considered Scheider&#x27;s role to be severely underdeveloped and &quot;consist[ing] of meaningful stares off camera and mournful grimaces&quot;.

On the other hand, &quot;Sorcerer&quot; garnered some acclaim from several major critics, including the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&#x27;s&quot; Roger Ebert, &quot;The New York Times&#x27;s&quot; chief film critic Vincent Canby, and Jack Kroll of &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

Ebert, in a November 1979 episode of &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; with Gene Siskel, called the film an &quot;overlooked classic&quot;, and was shocked that the film &quot;was so completely overlooked&quot; despite starring Academy Award nominee Roy Scheider and being directed by William Friedkin, an Oscar winner. Furthermore, he stated the movie had &quot;lots of fun&quot; and praised the suspension bridge scene in particular, saying it &quot;is maybe the most astonishing scene of the whole film. It&#x27;s a combination of desperation, suspense and great special effects as Roy Scheider and his partners try to maneuver a giant truck filled with nitrogliceryne through the heart of this jungle across a suspension bridge.&quot; Moreover, he emphasized that &quot;Sorcerer&quot; was &quot;on a level way above most action pictures,&quot; and called it &quot;a labor of love for director William Friedkin,&quot; and even went as far as to say that &quot;the jungle scenes, the rain and flood, the fire catastrophe are among the most exciting scenes I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; As far as the themes are concerned, his impression of Friedkin&#x27;s intentions was that &quot;he wanted to show human behavior at its extremes; men in torment to complete a life-or-death mission against all odds and discovering their own limits at the same time&quot;. Ebert considered &quot;Sorcerer&quot; one of the top 10 films of 1977.

Canby called &quot;Sorcerer&quot; &quot;a good little melodrama surrounded by pulp&quot;, and praised Scheider&#x27;s and Cremer&#x27;s performances, which he thought were &quot;extremely good&quot;; Scheider brought &quot;the dominant note of reckless desperation&quot;. On the other hand, he thought the picture &quot;should have been much, much tighter and less cinematically grand&quot;. In addition, he thought the movie would benefit from a different title to separate itself from &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. Kroll, in his &quot;Newsweek&quot; review, called the movie &quot;the toughest, most relentless American film in a long time&quot;.

==== Reassessment ====
The film today is more positively received by professional film critics. On the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes &quot;Sorcerer&quot; has an 83% rating, with an average score 7.6 out of 10, based on 52 reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Sorcerer&quot;, which obstinately motors along on its unpredictable speed, features ambitious sequences of insane white-knuckle tension.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 68/100 based on reviews from 13 critics. Numerous outlets noted that &quot;Sorcerer&quot; is now a subject of critical revaluation and rejuvenated interest, opposed to other less-known films of its era. Certain contemporary critics and artists also declared that Friedkin&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Wages of Fear&quot; novel surpasses that of H. G. Clouzot&#x27;s. This trend also led to a revisionism of Clouzot&#x27;s &quot;Wages of Fear&quot; which is now unfavourably criticized regarding certain aspects in comparison to Friedkin&#x27;s version.

Film critic Robert C. Cumbow, who heavily criticized the film in &quot;Movietone News&quot; (September 1977) at the time of release, has since reconsidered his initial thoughts and added an afterword in 2010 where he admits he now &quot;read[s] it with embarrassment&quot; and now recognizes elements he previously identified as &quot;inconclusive&quot; as aspects of &quot;Friedkin&#x27;s narrative economy, visceral impact, and avoidance of visual cliché&quot;; he closed his remarks that his view was a gradual and a long process.

On March 16, 2001, writer-director Peter Hanson summarized that &quot;Sorcerer&quot; contrasts with frequent self-indulgence of the 1970s and stated that the film is tremendously thrilling with a great deal of tension which he attributed to the plot&#x27;s construction as &quot;a probing descent into the psyche of an archetypal character driven insane by circumstance&quot;. He also praised the bridge crossing scene and lauded it &quot;one of the most elaborately filmed suspense sequences in cinema history&quot;, noting an overwhelming amount of camera set-ups which in his opinion amounted to creating &quot;an exruciating level of tension&quot; and such dedication is palpable throughout the whole film.

American movie reviewer D. K. Holm, in his 2005 book &quot;Film Soleil&quot;, described the film as &quot;superior to both its model and the novel from which both are loosely taken&quot;, as well as deeming the opening vignettes as an &quot;innovation&quot;. According to Holm, one of the most prominent threads in &quot;Sorcerer&quot; is that &quot;coping with frustration is the &#x27;journey&#x27; of life&quot;, which in his opinion &quot;excellently set[s] up&quot; the cliffhanger finale.

Academy Award nominee, screenwriter and director Josh Olson, most famous for his screenplay for &quot;A History of Violence&quot;, made a video review of Sorcerer for the &quot;Trailers from Hell&quot; webseries in 2007. He praised the movie highly, stating that it is Friedkin&#x27;s best effort (&quot;&quot;Sorcerer&quot; is Friedkin at the top of his game&quot;) and was &quot;at least equal to the original.&quot; He also applauded the atmosphere, which he said had &quot;a wonderful tone to it and a real sense of dread and desperation [...] it&#x27;s tight and suspenseful, every scene grabs you by the collar, and it&#x27;s beautifully shot. You can feel the humidity down there in South America. You can feel the sweat on the sticks of dynamite.&quot; He concluded the review by saying that the only aspect in which the movie failed was the fact that it came out around the same time as &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Olson felt that &quot;the movie deserved a huge audience&quot; as well as fantasizing that &quot;somewhere there&#x27;s an alternate universe where &quot;Sorcerer&quot; is a massive game-changing hit in Hollywood and I&#x27;m doing &quot;Trailers from Hell&quot; commentary on some unknown cult classic called &quot;Star Wars&quot;. In that world Hollywood has spent the next 30 years making smart, edgy movies for grown-ups, the literacy rate is 100%, we haven&#x27;t been in a war since Vietnam and world hunger is just a memory.&quot;

On August 21, 2009, author Stephen King posted an article in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; entitled &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s Reliable Rentals&quot;. In his list of &quot;20 [movies] that never disappoint,&quot; King placed the original &quot;Wages of Fear&quot; at #2 and Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;Sorcerer&quot; at #1, stating that although &quot;Wages of Fear&quot; &quot;is considered one of the greatest movies of the modern age&quot;, he preferred &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, and stated that Scheider&#x27;s Role as Jackie Scanlon was one of the two best roles in his entire career, as well as saying that the film &quot;generate[s] suspense through beautiful simplicity&quot;.

A prominent English film critic, Mark Kermode, also expressed his appreciation for the movie, saying that he had &quot;got a fondness for William Friedkin&#x27;s version of &quot;Wages of Fear&quot;,&quot; adding, however, that &quot;only an idiot would argue that &quot;Sorcerer&quot; is a better movie than &quot;Wages of Fear&quot;.&quot;

Quentin Tarantino has said, &quot;&quot;Sorcerer&quot; is to me one of the greatest movies ever made... The bridge scene is just one of the great suspense moments in cinema. It&#x27;s one of the great filming of sequences. The imagery itself, the editing.&quot; However, Tarantino also said that the casting of Roy Scheider in the lead role was a flaw: &quot;He&#x27;s not bad in the movie. He&#x27;s not the actor the movie needs. And it&#x27;s more to the fact the movie needed bigger shoulders to place this type of an epic on... Steve McQueen or Robert Blake, they would have been perfect.

=== Accolades ===

Crew members Robert Knudson, Robert Glass, Richard Tyler and Jean-Louis Ducarme were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound at the 50th Academy Awards in 1978 for work on this film.

=== International and home releases ===

==== International cuts ====

The film&#x27;s European as well as Australian cinema release cut 28 minutes from the original (but not in France, where the movie was distributed in its full-length version). In most regions of the world it was also retitled as &quot;Wages of Fear&quot; and distributed by Cinema International Corporation (later renamed as United International Pictures), a joint venture between Universal and Paramount specifically established for overseas distribution. This version opens in the village with the drivers already present, and ends with the delivery of explosives. The cuts were made by the international distributor Cinema International Corporation, without Friedkin&#x27;s consent in order to obtain more screenings. Friedkin referred to this cut as a &quot;mutilated&quot; version of his work. The opening vignettes are somewhat retained, albeit heavily shortened and inserted as flashbacks. Although the European cut is shorter, there is almost sixteen minutes of unique footage not shown in the original American theatrical version.

The aforementioned changes were approved by Verna Fields and commissioned to Jim Clark, who reluctantly agreed, and Cynthia Scheider. Fields was a Universal Studios executive who thought shortening and restructuring the movie would increase the film&#x27;s commercial potential. Scheider was also interested in applying those changes, offering his cooperation. Jim Clark was reportedly assured by Fields that Friedkin permitted changes, but was very suspicious about the authenticity of this claim. Therefore, Clark wrote an indemnity preventing Friedkin from any form of interference. Some additional dialogue written by Clark and Ken Levinson was later dubbed in. The studio did not possess the original work print; hence it was forced to work on the combined print. Jim Clark said the cut was &quot;at best, passable&quot; and was of the opinion that if he &quot;had left Friedkin&#x27;s version alone, it would have had exactly the same fate.&quot;

==== Home media ====
The film&#x27;s release on video was held up for many years; executives at Paramount and Universal argued it was ownership issues that was preventing a release, though a Universal spokesperson suggested that a lack of public interest might be another reason. A VHS version of &quot;Sorcerer&quot; was released on October 4, 1990. A laserdisc release followed on December 15, 1990. The DVD was released in the U.S. and Canada on November 17, 1998, and used the laserdisc transfer presented in a 1.33:1 non-widescreen version, which is not its original theatrical aspect ratio; it was shown in cinemas at a ratio of 1.85:1. However, since widescreen televisions have become popular, Friedkin has allowed many of his other films to be released on DVD in their original widescreen formats (&quot;The French Connection&quot;, &quot;Cruising&quot;, &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot;).

===== 2014 US home video re-release and 2017 UK home video release =====
In September 2013, Friedkin announced that new, remastered home video releases on Blu-ray and DVD were supposed to be released on April 14, 2014, however, both ended up being pushed to April 22. While the 2014 Blu-ray release contains a new, digitally remastered version of the movie, its DVD counterpart is simply a reissued version of the previous DVD release, and has not been authorized by Friedkin, who himself disowned it, and advised to avoid purchasing it. Furthermore, the director announced that he would supervise the remastering process for its proper DVD re-release, which hit US stores in August. In the US Blu-ray had no extra features, but was accompanied by a booklet with production stills and an excerpt of Friedkin&#x27;s memoir &quot;The Friedkin Connection&quot;, and was well-received upon release, with good reviews praising the quality of the transfer and reaching #1 in Drama and # 2 in Action/Adventure on Amazon.com. However, in the UK Blu-ray was released on November 6, 2017, and included a 74-minute ‘In Conversation’ film with the director, conducted by director Nicolas Winding Refn.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Sorcerer&quot;″s box office flop status had since led to comparisons with other financial failures of the time, particularly Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;One from the Heart&quot;, and Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;New York, New York&quot;. Critics argued that the fiasco of these films, among others, contributed to ending a period of auteur approach to the American cinema that was prominent in the 1970s.

In the opinion of several critics, the release of &quot;Star Wars&quot; marked a distinctive demographic shift among the audiences, as well as altering trends in the movie industry drastically, which at the same time contributed to &quot;Sorcerer&quot;″s financial and critical fiasco. Sean Macaulay notes that &quot;Star Wars&quot; changed the movie-going demography, considerably &quot;reset[ting] American cinema back to comforting fantasy&quot;. According to reviewer Pauline Kael, &quot;Star Wars&quot; contributed to &quot;infantilizing the audience&quot;, as well as &quot;obliterating irony, self-consciousness, and critical reflection&quot;, and to Tom Shone, who drew from Kael, was impossible to compete with by Friedkin and &quot;Sorcerer&quot;. Biskind also thought the American movie-going demographic had changed considerably since &quot;The French Connection&quot;, and &quot;Sorcerer&quot; was &quot;too episodic, dark, and star-challenged&quot; to achieve mainstream appreciation. RH Greene argues that &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which in his opinion was &quot;pure escapism&quot;, made intellectually demanding films like &quot;Sorcerer&quot; obsolete.

Bill Gibron marks the demise of unrestrained writer-director creative control in favor of studio-governed film-making with &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, and adds that &quot;Sorcerer&quot; also significantly contributed to this trend. Sheldon Hall theorizes that success of films like &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; set the trends in Hollywood cinema for the decades to come. This was, in contrast to the &quot;subversive attitude&quot; which then journalists heralded as the pinnacle of filmmaking. Hall observes that films such as &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;Deliverance&quot;, &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; and &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; &quot;have few equivalents in Hollywood after the 1970s&quot;. Furthermore, he states that the last favorable year for New Hollywood was 1976, and &quot;socially critical, stylistically adventurous cinema&quot; would soon be substituted by &quot;ideologically and formally conservative work&quot; of directors like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. The critic holds the opinion that several financial fiascoes, including &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, &quot;New York, New York&quot;, &quot;One From the Heart&quot;, and &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, were auteur movies aspiring to achieve mainstream success but were panned by the movie-goers and critics alike. This belief is also held by J. Hoberman to whom the period immediately following 1975&#x27;s &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; marked the point when &quot;experimental films became less and less able to recoup their costs&quot;.

Justin Wyatt concludes that the downfall of &quot;the experimental period&quot; was followed by a retreat to &quot;large-scale grand filmmaking&quot;, a Hollywood staple from early to mid-1960s and adds that filmmakers such as Peter Bogdanovich, Friedkin, and Arthur Penn still continued their cinematic involvement but their most ambitious work had been produced during the peak of New Hollywood era, which was characterized by &quot;financial experimentation&quot;. Nat Segaloff observes that cinematic trends presented in &quot;Sorcerer&quot; were later abandoned by the studio system, an opinion mirrored by Phil Mucci, who holds the opinion that &quot;Sorcerer&quot; stands for a cinematic style that is unlikely to be seen again&quot;. William Friedkin states in the 2003 documentary &quot;A Decade Under the Influence&quot; that cynicism was a ubiquitous attitude in the country during the 1970s, so the studios were receptive to it, which made &quot;filmmakers and the studio heads be in sync&quot; and added that artistic content was never questioned, only the costs. On the other hand, the director thinks this trend is impossible to return, because he feels that nowadays &quot;a film has to serve the greater good of the corporation in order to get made and it cannot be subversive in nature. As well as, has to have the broadest possible appeal, so that it will help other divisions of the corporation&quot;.

Friedkin sat for an interview with the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn in February 2015, in which they discussed the film at length. It was produced by the French distribution company La Rabbia.

The film was selected for screening as part of the Cannes Classics section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.

In 2017, Friedkin described &quot;Sorcerer&quot; as &quot;the only film I’ve made that I can still watch.&quot;

== Court case, restoration, and re-release ==
In April 2012, it was reported that Friedkin was suing Universal and Paramount over the domestic rights of &quot;Sorcerer&quot; for a share of the movie&#x27;s profits. In a July 2012 interview, Friedkin said that the film&#x27;s case was pending at the Ninth District Court of Appeals in California with a settlement to be announced by November 26. Had no settlement been reached by that time, the jury would have to set a trial date for March 2013. The director emphasized that his intent was not dictated by profits but by the desire to have it released on DVD and Blu-ray, and to have a film print for various outlets, such as film societies and universities. He also noted that if the case were to become precedential, he hoped it would help other pictures in a similar situation.

In a July 2012 interview, Friedkin said Universal and Paramount both claimed they did not own the film and did not know who did, a consequence of the bankruptcy of Cinema International Corporation, a company granted an ownership by Universal Studios and Paramount Pictures, and commissioned to release films in international markets. Friedkin said he believed any issues related to the matter were of bookkeeping nature.

In December 2012, Friedkin revealed that the film rights were in fact owned by Universal, as the Paramount lease had expired after 25 years. He also added he would meet Warner Bros., which wanted a sublease, and also announced that he would be meeting with the head of Universal Studios; if the outcome was negative, he would have to resort to a legal case. Friedkin also indicated that restoration of &quot;Sorcerer&quot; would require a considerable amount of work, stating that he did not, at the time, possess any prints of good quality. He added that Paramount had made a print around the beginning of 2012, which was shown at the American Cinematheque&#x27;s Aero Theatre, and he was trying to locate it, noting difficulties related to obtaining the print as the studio no longer possessed an adequate capacity to deal with the matter, and off-shore companies involved in the legal matters were now greatly reduced in staff. He said that was why acquiring the film&#x27;s print was time-consuming.

On February 11, 2013, Friedkin announced that money had been budgeted to create a new, digital master copy of &quot;Sorcerer&quot;. He also asserted that the original negative is in a good state. He followed this with a statement that The Criterion Collection would not be the film&#x27;s publisher.

In March 2013, Friedkin revealed that he had dropped his lawsuit against Universal and Paramount, and that he and a &quot;major studio&quot; were involved in the creation of a new, recolored digital print of &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, to be tentatively screened at the Venice Film Festival and to receive a Blu-ray release:
On April 14, 2013, the aforementioned 35 mm print of &quot;Sorcerer&quot; from the Paramount archives was screened at the Chicago Film Critics Association&#x27;s first annual film festival, with Friedkin in attendance. He remarked that the film &quot;hasn&#x27;t dated... It&#x27;s set in a kind of limbo and neither the haircuts nor the wardrobes nor the sets have aged poorly.&quot;

On May 2, 2013, the director announced the pending re-release, a new, digital print, and a premiere at the Venice Film Festival on August 29. where he would also receive a lifetime achievement award.

Restoration of the print is supervised by Friedkin himself, along with Ned Price and a colorist, Bryan McMahan, Friedkin&#x27;s collaborator since 1994. In addition, Friedkin also confirmed there would be DVD and Blu-ray disc releases. Friedkin also stated that Warner Bros. financed the restoration, and that the distribution rights would be split between Paramount for theatrical, Warner Bros. for home and streaming media, and Universal for television. According to Friedkin, making of the new print was to commence in June, 2013. The director described his efforts to restore and re-release &quot;Sorcerer&quot; as &quot;a truly Lazarus moment&quot; and said he was gratified that &quot;it’s going to have a new life in cinema&quot;.

On June 4, 2013, the director declared that the color grading would commence on June 10, 2013, which said was completed by June 25. There was no distortion of original colors, he said, and a 5.1 surround sound transfer was planned for June 28, 2013. Moreover, he also revealed an audio commentary and extra features would be part of the Blu-ray release. On July 17, 2013, Friedkin announced that the film&#x27;s soundtrack has been remastered. Two days before the Venice screening, Friedkin announced that a theatrical screening had been booked at Los Angeles&#x27; Cinefamily for spring 2014. On September 12, 2013, Friedkin revealed April 14, 2014 would be the release date of the film&#x27;s Blu-ray home video version.

<text>Tetradium is a genus of trees in the family Rutaceae, occurring in temperate to tropical East Asia. In older books, the genus was often included in the related genus &quot;Euodia&quot; (sometimes written, &quot;Evodia&quot; from latin spelling), but that genus is now restricted to tropical species. In cultivation in English-speaking countries, they are known as Euodia, Evodia, or Bee bee tree.

They are attractive trees with deciduous glossy pinnate leaves. &quot;Tetradium daniellii&quot; (syn. &quot;T. hupehensis&quot;) develops a smooth gray bark that resembles that of a beech tree and grows to a height of 20 metres (65&#x27;). The leaves resemble the foliage of an ash tree and are a glossy dark green in summer. In fall there is little color change and leaves tend to drop green to yellow-green. The tree is covered in late July and August with masses of large flat white to gray cluster of small white flowers, particularly valued when few other tree-size plants are flowering. It attracts large numbers of bees and is sought after by beekeepers as a source of late summer honey. The flowers produce clusters of seed that is present from late August through November. The seeds start as bright red capsules that when fully ripe open to expose shiny black buckshot seed as Autumn progresses. The small, red-to-black berries are popular with many birds.

&quot;Tetradium&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Aenetus scotti&quot; and &quot;Endoclita damor&quot;.

The genus is also closely related to &quot;Melicope&quot; and is sometimes included within it. Melicope elleryana is sometimes referred to as Evodia, or Euodia.

<text>Udmurtia, officially the Udmurt Republic, is a republic of Russia located in Eastern Europe. It is administratively part of the Volga Federal District. Its capital is the city of Izhevsk.

It was established as the Udmurt (until 1931 — Votskaya) Autonomous Region on November 4, 1920.

==Name==
The name &quot;Udmurt&quot; comes from (&#x27;meadow people&#x27;), where the first part represents the Permic root or (&#x27;meadow, glade, turf, greenery&#x27;). This is supported by a document dated 1557, in which the Udmurts are referred to as (&#x27;meadow people&#x27;), alongside the traditional Russian name . 

The second part means &#x27;person&#x27; (cf. Komi , Mari ). It is probably an early borrowing from a Scythian language: or (&#x27;person, man&#x27;; 
Sanskrit: Manus or Manushya), which is thought to have been borrowed from the Indo-Aryan term (&#x27;man, mortal, one who is bound to die&#x27;. cf. Old Indic (&#x27;young warrior&#x27;) and (&#x27;chariot warrior&#x27;), both connected specifically with horses and chariots. The Indo-Europeanists T. Gamkrelidze and V. Ivanov associate this word with horse-riding Altaic tribes in the .

On the other hand, in the Russian tradition, the name &#x27;meadow people&#x27; refers to the inhabitants of the left bank of river in particular. Recently, the most relevant is the version of V. V. Napolskikh and S. K. Belykh. They suppose that ethnonym was borrowed either from Indo-Iranian &#x27;outside, close, last, edge, limit, boundary&#x27; or Turkic-Altaic / &#x27;oath (in fidelity), comrade, friend&#x27;.

==History==

On November 4, 1920, the Votyak Autonomous Oblast was formed. On January 1, 1932, it was renamed Udmurt Autonomous Oblast, which was then reorganized into the Udmurt ASSR on December 28, 1934. During World War II, many industrial factories were evacuated from the Ukrainian SSR and western borderlands to Udmurtia.

On October 11, 1991, the Supreme Council of the Udmurt ASSR adopted a law according to which the Udmurt ASSR acquired a new name — the Udmurt Republic.

==Geography==
The republic is located to the west of the Ural Mountains and borders Kirov, Perm, Bashkortostan, and Tatarstan.

Udmurtia is a republic in the Russian Federation, located in Central Russia between the branches of the rivers Kama and its right tributary the Vyatka.

The city of Izhevsk is the administrative, industrial, and cultural center of Udmurtia. Geographically, it is located not far from Moscow, the capital and largest city of the Russian Federation. The city has a well-developed transport system (including air, land, and water).

Udmurtia borders Kirov Oblast to the west and north, Perm Oblast to the east, and the Bashkortostan and Tatarstan Republics to the south.

===Climate===
The republic has a moderate continental climate, with warm summers and cold, snowy winters. Annual precipitation averages 400–600 mm.
==Administrative divisions==
==Demographics==
Population: 

Although as of 2007 the population was declining, the decline was stabilizing and was more pronounced in urban areas. Out of the 19,667 births reported in 2007, 12,631 were in urban areas (11.86 per 1,000) and 7,036 were in rural areas (14.88 per 1,000). Birth rates for rural areas are 25% higher than that of urban areas. Of the total of 21,727 deaths, 14,366 were reported in urban areas (13.49 per 1,000) and 7,361 were in rural areas (15.56 per 1,000). Natural decline of the population was measured at −0.16% for urban areas and an insignificant −0.07% for rural areas (the average for Russia was −0.33% in 2007).

===Ethnic groups===
According to the 2021 Census, Russians make up 67.7% of the republic&#x27;s population, while the ethnic Udmurts make up only 24.1%. Other groups include Tatars (5.5%), Mari (0.5%), Ukrainians (0.3%), and a host of smaller groups, each accounting for less than 0.5% of the republic&#x27;s total population.

Over two-thirds of the world population of Udmurts live in the republic.

===Religious groups===
According to a 2012 survey, 33.1% of the population of Udmurtia adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 5% are unaffiliated generic Christians, 2% are Eastern Orthodox Christian believers without belonging to any church or members of other Eastern Orthodox churches, 4% are Muslims, 2% of the population adheres to the Slavic native faith (Rodnovery) or to Udmurt Vos (Udmurt native faith), 1% adheres to forms of Protestantism, and 1% of the population are Old Believers. In addition, 29% of the population declares to be &quot;spiritual but not religious,&quot; 19% is atheist, and 3.9% follows other religions or did not give an answer to the question.

The local Russian Orthodox Church is the Metropolitanate of Udmurtia, comprising the Eparchy of Izhevsk (founded 1927) under Bishop and Metropolitan Viktorin (Kostenkov) (2015), the Eparchy of Glazov (founded 1889) under Bishop Viktor (Sergeyev), and the Eparchy of Sarapul (founded 1868) under Bishop Anthony (Prostikhin) (2015).

====Jews====

Udmurt Jews are a special territorial group of the Ashkenazi Jews, which started to be formed in the residential areas of mixed Turkic-speaking (Tatars, Kryashens, Bashkirs, Chuvash people), Finno-Ugric-speaking (Udmurts, Mari people) and Slavic-speaking (Russians) population. The Ashkenazi Jews on the territory of the Udmurt Republic first appeared in the 1830s. The Udmurt Jewry had formed the local variety on the base of the Yiddish of Udmurtia till the 1930s and features of Yiddish of migrants &quot;joined&quot; into it (in the 1930s and 1940s); as a result up to the 1970s and 1980s the Udmurt variety of Yiddish (&quot;Udmurtish&quot;) was divided into two linguistic subgroups: the central subgroup (with centers Izhevsk, Sarapul, and Votkinsk) and the southern subgroup (with centers Kambarka, Alnashi, Agryz, and Naberezhnye Chelny). One of the characteristic features of the Udmurtish is a noticeable number of Udmurt and Tatar loan words.

==Culture==

Udmurt folklore is understood both in a broad sense (, , - folk knowledge, folk wisdom), and in a narrower one (, - folk poetry, oral poetry). In everyday life, folklore is not divided into genres, it is perceived in unity with material culture, with religious, legal, and ethical aspects. Popular terms-definitions have incorporated the ritual action (, , , , , , ), symbolically figurative and magically forming words (, , , ), musical and choreographic behavior (, , , , ).

<doc id="447149" wikidata="Q1737082" url="?curid=447149" title="Chiclet keyboard">
<text>A chiclet keyboard is a computer keyboard with keys that form an array of small, flat rectangular or lozenge-shaped rubber or plastic keys that look like erasers or &quot;Chiclets&quot;, a brand of chewing gum manufactured in the shape of small squares with rounded corners. It is an evolution of the membrane keyboard, using the same principle of a single rubber sheet with individual electrical switches underneath each key, but with the addition of an additional upper layer which provides superior tactile feedback through a buckling mechanism. The term &quot;chiclet keyboard&quot; is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to island-style keyboards.

Since the mid-1980s, chiclet keyboards have been mainly restricted to lower-end electronics, such as small handheld calculators, cheap PDAs and many remote controls, though the name is also used to refer to scissor keyboards with superficially similar appearance.

== History ==

The term first appeared during the home computer era of the late 1970s to mid-1980s. The TRS-80 Color Computer, TRS-80 MC-10, and Timex Sinclair 2068 were all described as having &quot;chiclet keys&quot;.

This style of keyboard has been met with a poor reception. John Dvorak wrote that it was &quot;associated with $99 el cheapo computers&quot;. The keys on ZX Spectrum computers are &quot;rubber dome keys&quot; which were sometimes described as &quot;dead flesh&quot;, while the feel of the IBM PCjr&#x27;s chiclet keyboard was reportedly compared to &quot;massaging fruit cake&quot;. Its quality was such that an amazed Tandy executive, whose company had previously released a computer with a similarly unpopular keyboard, asked &quot;How could IBM have made that mistake with the PCjr?&quot;

== Design ==


Chiclet keyboards operate under essentially the same mechanism as in the membrane keyboard. In both cases, a keypress is registered when the top layer is forced through a hole to touch the bottom layer. For every key, the conductive traces on the bottom layer are normally separated by a non-conductive gap. Electrical current cannot flow between them; the switch is open. However, when pushed down, conductive material on the underside of the top layer bridges the gap between those traces; the switch is closed, current can flow, and a keypress is registered. All such keyboards are characterized by having each key surrounded (and held in place) by a perforated plate, so there is a space between the keys.

Unlike the membrane keyboard, where the user presses directly onto the top membrane layer, this form of chiclet keyboard places a set of moulded rubber keys above this. With some key designs, the user pushes the key, and under sufficient pressure the thin sides of the rubber key suddenly collapse. In other designs — such as that seen in the diagram — the deliberate weak point is where the key joins the rest of the sheet. The effect is similar in both cases. This collapse allows the solid rubber center to move downwards, forcing the top membrane layer against the bottom layer, and completing the circuit. The &quot;sudden collapse&quot; of the chiclet keyboard (along with the movement of the key) provides a greater tactile feedback to the user than a simple flat membrane keyboard.

Most often the tops of the keys were hard, but sometimes they were made of the same material as the rubber dome itself.

Other versions of the chiclet keyboard omit the upper membrane and hole/spacer layers; instead the underside of the rubber keys themselves have a conductive coating. When the key is pushed, the conductive underside makes contact with the traces on the bottom layer, and bridges the gap between them, thus completing the circuit. Grooves between hollow domes on the blue underside permit air to flow out of a dome when a key is pressed, and let air come back in when released.

The dome switch keyboards used with a large proportion of modern PCs are technically similar to chiclet keyboards. The rubber keys are replaced with rubber domes, and hard plastic keytops rest on top of these. Because the keytops are wider than the rubber domes, the keytops are not separated but align almost perfectly with only a minimal gap in between each other.

== Legacy ==

The term &quot;chiclet&quot; has also been used to describe low-profile, low-travel scissor keyboards with simplified, flat keycaps separated by a bezel. The first laptop to feature this style of chiclet keyboard was the Mitsubishi Pedion in 1997 (rebranded as the OmniBook Sojourn by Hewlett-Packard). Sony popularized the chiclet keyboard in laptops with the release of the Vaio X505 in 2004.

<doc id="447151" wikidata="Q2706107" url="?curid=447151" title="Dividend yield">
<text>The dividend yield or dividend–price ratio of a share is the dividend per share divided by the price per share. It is also a company&#x27;s total annual dividend payments divided by its market capitalization, assuming the number of shares is constant. It is often expressed as a percentage.

Dividend yield is used to calculate the dividend earning on investments.

==Analysis==
Historically, a higher dividend yield has been considered to be desirable among many investors. A high dividend yield can be considered to be evidence that a stock is underpriced or that the company has fallen on hard times and future dividends will not be as high as previous ones. Similarly a low dividend yield can be considered evidence that the stock is overpriced or that future dividends might be higher. Some investors may find a higher dividend yield attractive, for instance as an aid to marketing a fund to retail investors, or maybe because they cannot get their hands on the capital, which may be tied up in a trust arrangement. In contrast some investors may find a higher dividend yield unattractive, perhaps because it increases their tax bill.

Dividend yield fell out of favor somewhat during the 1990s because of an increasing emphasis on price appreciation over dividends as the main form of return on investments.

The importance of the dividend yield in determining investment strength is still a debated topic; most recently, Foye and Valentincic (2017) suggested that high dividend yield stocks tend to outperform. The persistent historic low in the Dow Jones dividend yield during the early 21st century is considered by some investors as indicative that the market is still overvalued.

=== Dow Industrials ===
The dividend yield of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is obtained from the annual dividends of all 30 companies in the average divided by their cumulative stock price, has also been considered to be an important indicator of the strength of the U.S. stock market. Historically, the Dow Jones dividend yield has fluctuated between 3.2% (during market highs, for example in 1929) and around 8.0% (during typical market lows). The highest ever Dow Jones dividend yield occurred in 1932 when it yielded over 15%, which was years after the famous stock market collapse of 1929, when it yielded only 3.1%.

With the decreased emphasis on dividends since the mid-1990s, the Dow Jones dividend yield has fallen well below its historical low-water mark of 3.2% and reached as low as 1.4% during the stock market peak of 2000.

The Dogs of the Dow is a popular investment strategy which invests in the ten highest dividend yield Dow stocks at the beginning of each calendar year.

=== S&amp;P 500 ===
In 1982 the dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 Index reached 6.7%. Over the following 16 years, the dividend yield declined to just a percentage value of 1.4% during 1998, because stock prices increased faster than dividend payments from earnings, and public company earnings increased more slowly than stock prices. During the 20th century, the highest growth rates for earnings and dividends over any 30-year period were 6.3% annually for dividends, and 7.8% for earnings.

==Overview==

=== Terminology ===

==== Current yield ====
The current yield is the ratio of the annual dividend to the current market price, which will vary over time.

==== Trailing and forward ====
Trailing dividend yield gives the dividend percentage paid over a prior period, typically one year. A trailing twelve month dividend yield, denoted as &quot;TTM&quot;, includes all dividends paid during the past year in order to calculate the dividend yield. While a trailing dividend can be indicative of future dividends, it can be misleading as it does not account for dividend increases or cuts, nor does it account for a special dividend that may not occur again in the future.

Forward dividend yield is some estimation of the future yield of a stock. This may be an analyst&#x27;s estimate, or just using the company&#x27;s guidance. For example, if a company has announced a dividend increase, even though nothing has been paid, this may be assumed to be the payment for the next year. Similarly, if a company has said that it will suspend its dividend, the yield would be assumed to be zero.

The calculation is done by taking the first dividend payment and annualizing it and then divide that number by the current stock price. In other words, if the first quarterly dividend were and the current stock price were the forward dividend yield would be formula_1.

The trailing dividend yield is done in reverse by taking the last dividend annualized divided by the current stock price.

:formula_2

==== Yield on cost ====
Yield is sometimes computed based on the amount &quot;paid&quot; for a stock. For example, if stock X was bought for , it split 2:1 three times (resulting in 8 total shares), it is now trading for ( for 8 shares), and it pays a dividend of , then the yield on cost is 80% (8 shares × = paid over $20 invested -&gt; 16/20 = 0.8). The yield with the current price is 4% ( over $50 share price -&gt; 2/50 = 0.04).

=== Common shares ===
Unlike preferred stock, there is no stipulated dividend for common stock (&quot;ordinary shares&quot; in the UK). Instead, dividends paid to holders of common stock are set by management, usually in consonance with company earnings. There is no guarantee that future dividends will match past dividends or even be paid at all. The historic yield is calculated using the following formula:

:formula_3

For example, take a company which paid dividends totaling per share last year and whose shares currently sell for . Its dividend yield would be calculated as follows:

:formula_4

The yield for the S&amp;P 500 is reported this way. US newspaper and web listings of common stocks apply a somewhat different calculation: They report the latest quarterly dividend multiplied by 4, divided by the current price. Others try to estimate the next year&#x27;s dividend and use it to derive a prospective dividend yield. Such a scheme is used for the calculation of the &quot;FTSE UK Dividend+ Index&quot;. Estimates of future dividend yields are by definition uncertain.

=== Preferred shares ===

==== Nominal yield ====
Dividend payments on preferred stocks are set out in the prospectus. The name of the preferred share will typically include its nominal yield relative to the issue price: for example, a 6% preferred share. However, the dividend may under some circumstances be passed or reduced.

==== Yield to call ====
The &quot;yield to call&quot; figure for a callable preferred share is the effective current yield, assuming that the issuer will exercise the call contingency immediately on the call date. The yield to call is implicitly a current measure of a future value, accounting for the difference between the future call price versus the current market price. Since the current market price may be above or below the call price, the yield to call may be below or above the current yield.

==== Yield to worst ====
For callable preferred stocks, the &quot;yield to worst&quot; is the lesser of the current yield and the yield to call. Yield to worst represents the minimum of the various yield measures, across the returns resulting from various contingent future events. This amounts to the worst case outcome from the investor&#x27;s position.

Preferred issues that are not callable, or whose call date has already arrived, do not have a yield to call or yield to worst. The only present yield measure in such cases is the current yield.

=== Related measures ===
The reciprocal of the dividend yield is the price/dividend ratio. The dividend yield is related to the earnings yield via:
* earnings yield = dividend yield · dividend cover
* dividend yield = earnings yield · dividend payout ratio.

<doc id="447152" wikidata="Q76240" url="?curid=447152" title="Facial (sexual act)">
<text>A facial is a sexual activity in which a man ejaculates semen onto the face of one or more sexual partners. A facial is a form of non-penetrative sex, though it is generally performed after some other means of sexual stimulation, such as vaginal sex, anal sex, oral sex, manual sex or masturbation. Facials are regularly portrayed in pornographic films and videos, often as a way to close a scene.

The performance of a facial is typically preceded by activities that result in the sexual arousal and stimulation of the ejaculating participant. After the prerequisite level of sexual stimulation has been achieved, and ejaculation becomes imminent, the male will position his penis in a way that allows the discharged semen to be deposited onto his partner&#x27;s face.

The volume of semen that is ejaculated depends on several factors, including the male&#x27;s health, age, degree of sexual excitement, and the time since his last ejaculation. Normal quantities of ejaculate range from 1.5 to 5.0 milliliters (1 teaspoon). Seconds after being deposited onto the face, the semen thickens, before liquefying 15–30 minutes later.

==Cultural depictions==
Predating the modern age of pornography, facials were described in literature. As an example, the French aristocrat Marquis de Sade wrote about performing facials in his work &quot;The 120 Days of Sodom&quot;, written in 1785. One passage of the novel reads &quot;… I show them my prick, then what do you suppose I do? I squirt the fuck in their face… That&#x27;s my passion my child, I have no other… and you&#x27;re about to behold it.&quot;

===In mainstream pornography===
In the 1970s, the hardcore pornography genre introduced the stereotypical cumshot (also known as the money shot) scene as a central element (leitmotif) of the hardcore film, in which the male actor ejaculates in a way ensuring maximum visibility of the act itself. These scenes may involve the female actor &quot;calling for&quot; the shot to be directed at some specific part of her body. Now facial cumshots are regularly portrayed in pornographic films, videos, magazines and internet web sites.

In addition to mainstream pornography, the popularity of facials has led to creation of its own niche market, like video series that specialize in showing the act. In 2010, psychologist Ana Bridges and colleagues conducted a content analysis of best-selling heterosexual pornographic videos showing that over 96% of all scenes concluded with a male performer ejaculating onto the body of his female partner. The mouth was the most common area to be ejaculated upon. When all regions of the face are included, facial cum shots occur in approximately 62% of scenes where external ejaculation occurs.

=== In feminist pornography ===

When feminist pornography emerged in 1980s, pioneer Candida Royalle always excluded facial cum shots, and with few exceptions all other male external ejaculations, from her sex scenes. Ms. Naughty&#x27;s (since 2000) and Petra Joy&#x27;s work (since 2004) has followed the same principle. In the early works Tristan Taormino (since 1999), facials were also deliberately excluded, but after her thinking about feminist porn gradually changed, she sometimes included such acts in her later productions. Erika Lust has occasionally featured facials ever since her 2004 debut &quot;The Good Girl&quot;.

==Health risks==

===Transmission of disease===
Any sexual activity that involves contact with the bodily fluids of another person contains the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs). Semen is in itself generally harmless on the skin or if swallowed. However, semen can be the vehicle for many sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV and hepatitis. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration categorizes semen as &quot;other potentially infectious material&quot; or OPIM.

The risks incurred by the giving and receiving partner during the facial sexual act are drastically different. For the ejaculating partner there is almost no risk of contracting an STI. For the receiving partner, the risk is higher. Since potentially infected semen could come into contact with broken skin or sensitive mucous membranes (i.e., eyes, lips, mouth), there is a risk of contracting an infectious disease.

===Allergic reactions===
In rare cases, people have been known to experience allergic reactions to seminal fluids, known as human seminal plasma hypersensitivity. Symptoms can be either localized or systemic, and may include itching, redness, swelling, or blisters within 30 minutes of contact. They may also include hives and even difficulty breathing.

Treatment options for semen allergy include avoiding exposure to seminal fluid by use of condoms and attempting desensitization.

==Criticisms and responses==

===Criticisms===

There are a variety of views ranging from facials being an act of degradation and elicit humiliation to being grounded in mutual respect and elicit pleasure. Feminist views of the depiction of male-on-female facials are primarily critical, even amongst some sex-positive feminists (including feminist pornographers), although other sex-positive feminists regard it as always acceptable, or only acceptable if certain conditions are met.

==== General ====
Sex therapist Ruth Westheimer believes facials are &quot;humiliating and not sexy&quot;. She advises the average person contemplating oral sex to not think that a facial is a necessary part of the act. In response to an inquiry from a reader, sex columnist Dan Savage wrote: &quot;Facials are degrading—and that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re so hot.&quot; &quot;Daily Nexus&quot; columnist Nina Love Anthony views the practice of facials in a non-threatening light, feeling that it adds variety to the sexual experience. In one of her weekly articles she wrote, &quot;But let&#x27;s give credit where credit is due: The money shot, by itself, is great for a number of reasons. Blowing it on someone&#x27;s face is like a change-up pitch—if you&#x27;ve been throwing the heat for a while, maybe you should consider hooking the curve ball.&quot; She continues with, &quot;Also, being on the receiving end of the shot can satisfy the secret porn star in everyone and it&#x27;s minor kink for beginners.&quot;

==== Anti-porn feminists ====
Sociologists Gail Dines, Robert Jensen and Russo echo these sentiments in the book &quot;Pornography: The Production and Consumption of Inequality&quot;. It asserts, &quot;In pornography, ejaculating onto a woman is a primary method by which she is turned into a slut, something (not really someone) whose primary, if not only, purpose is to be sexual with men.&quot; Radical feminist and noted critic of pornography Andrea Dworkin said &quot;it is a convention of pornography that the sperm is on her not in her. It marks the spot, what he owns and how he owns it. The ejaculation on her is a way of saying (through showing) that she is contaminated with his dirt; that she is dirty.&quot;

In Padraig McGrath&#x27;s review of Laurence O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s book &quot;Pornocopia – Porn, Sex, Technology and Desire&quot;, he rhetorically asks whether &quot;…women enjoy having men ejaculate on their faces?&quot; He suggests that the role of such a scene is to illustrate that &quot;…it doesn&#x27;t matter what the woman likes—she&#x27;ll like whatever the man wants her to like because she has no inner life of her own, in turn because she&#x27;s not a real person&quot;. McGrath argues that there is a &quot;power-aspect&quot; to depictions such as cum shots. He suggests that the &quot;…central theme [of pornography] is power…[,] implicitly violent… eroticized hatred.&quot;

Gail Dines, writing in &quot;Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality&quot;, describes the money shot of a man ejaculating on the face or body of a woman as &quot;one of the most degrading acts in porn&quot;. To Dines, the ejaculate on the female performer&#x27;s body &quot;marks the woman as used goods&quot;, conveying a sense of ownership, and she quotes veteran porn actor and producer Bill Margold as saying, &quot;I&#x27;d like to really show what I believe the men want to see: violence against women. I firmly believe that we serve a purpose by showing that. The most violent we can get is the cum shot in the face. Men get off behind that because they get even with the women they can&#x27;t have.&quot; She adds that at least for some posters on adult forums discussing such scenes, the pleasure is derived from watching a woman suffer. However, Dines also describes that &quot;when you speak to pornographers, they tend themselves not to know&quot; the origins of these sorts of things.

==== Feminist pornographers ====

Feminist pornographers disagree amongst themselves whether facials should be regarded as representing or having the effect of gender inequality, should therefore not be considered feminist and thus excluded from feminist pornography, or that such depictions can be feminist if many female viewers enjoy it, or depending on a number of factors such as consent, context, chemistry, and performer agency. It is widely recognised amongst sex-positive feminists that the fact that people see facials in porn can lead them to want to do it in real life with their partners as well, and that this could (but, according to some, does not necessarily have to) have a negative impact on real-life sexuality.

Pornography-actress-turned-filmmaker Candida Royalle was a critic of &quot;cum shot&quot; scenes in mainstream pornography. She produced pornographic films aimed at women and their partners that avoid the &quot;misogynous predictability&quot; and depiction of sex in &quot;…as grotesque and graphic [a way] as possible.&quot; Royalle was also critical of the male-centredness of the typical pornography film, in which scenes end when the male actor ejaculates, and therefore decided to exclude all facial cum shots, and with few exceptions all other male external ejaculations, from her porn films. 

Commenting on Erika Lust&#x27;s work, feminist pornographer Petra Joy (2007) argued: &#x27;Feminism is committed to equality of the sexes, so surely &quot;feminist porn&quot; should show women as equals to men rather than as subservient beings... If you want to show cum on a woman&#x27;s face that&#x27;s fine but don&#x27;t call it feminist.&#x27; Lust (2007) retorted, mocking &#x27;the Church of the Pure Feminist Porn Producers... declaring that certain sexual practices that me and other women across the world happen to like, are a sin.&#x27; 

Separately, as some of her critics alleged, Tristan Taormino (2013) has admitted that she cannot control how certain portrayals such as facials may be received by some viewers, &#x27;specifically that men&#x27;s orgasms represent the apex of a scene (and of sex itself) and women&#x27;s bodies are things to be used, controlled, and marked like territory&#x27;. When making her first film, Taormino &#x27;embraced the notion that certain depictions were turn-offs to all women, like facial cum shots. But my thinking on this has changed over time. I believe viewers appreciate consent, context, chemistry, and performer agency more than the presence or absence of a specific act.&#x27;

===Responses===

Sociologist Lisa Jean Moore suggests that Dworkin&#x27;s explanation does not take into account that it is the pleasure the actresses exhibit that the male partners enjoy, and that it is more accurate to think men want their semen to be wanted. Correspondingly it is a porn industry standard for the actress to act eager and loving for the facial she receives, and not in displeasure. If displeasure was shown it was usually considered a failed shot.

Women&#x27;s activist Beatrice Faust argued, &quot;since ejaculating into blank space is not much fun, ejaculating over a person who responds with enjoyment sustains a lighthearted mood as well as a degree of realism.&quot; She goes on to say &quot;Logically, if sex is natural and wholesome and semen is as healthy as sweat, there is no reason to interpret ejaculation as a hostile gesture.&quot; Joseph Slade, professor at Ohio University, notes in his book &quot;Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide&quot; that adult industry actresses in the 1960s and 1970s did not trust birth control methods, and that more than one actress of the period told him that ejaculation inside her body was deemed inconsiderate if not rude.

Sexologist Peter Sándor Gardos argues that his research suggests that &quot;… the men who get most turned on by watching cum shots are the ones who have positive attitudes toward women&quot; (on the annual meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sex in 1992). Later, on The World Pornography Conference in 1998, he reported a similar conclusion, namely that &quot;no pornographic image is interpretable outside of its historical and social context. Harm or degradation does not reside in the image itself&quot;.

Cindy Patton, activist and scholar on human sexuality, claims that in western culture male sexual fulfillment is synonymous with orgasm and that the male orgasm is an essential punctuation of the sexual narrative. No orgasm, no sexual pleasure. No cum shot, no narrative closure. In other words, the cum shot is the period at the end of the sentence. In her essay &quot;Speaking Out: Teaching In&quot;, Patton reached the conclusion that critics have devoted too little space to discovering the meaning that viewers attach to specific acts such as cum shots.

<doc id="447168" wikidata="Q2991006" url="?curid=447168" title="Earl of Caithness">
<text>Earl of Caithness is a title that has been created several times in the Peerage of Scotland, and it has a very complex history. Its first grant, in the modern sense as to have been counted in strict lists of peerages, is now generally held to have taken place in favor of Maol Íosa V, Earl of Strathearn, in 1334, although in the true circumstances of 14th century, this presumably was just a recognition of his hereditary right to the ancient earldom/mormaership of Caithness. The next year, however, all of his titles were declared forfeit for treason.

==History==
Earlier, Caithness had been intermittently held, presumably always as fief of Scotland, by the Norse earls of Orkney, at least since the days of the childhood of Thorfinn Sigurdsson in c.1020, but possibly already several decades before. The modern reconstruction of holders of peerage earldoms do not usually include those of Mormaerdom of Caithness, although there is no essential difference between them and, for example, those of mormaers of Lennox, mormaers of Strathearn and mormaers of Angus.

The next grant after Maol Íosa was to David Stewart, a younger son of Robert II of Scotland. His heiress, Euphemia, resigned the title in 1390 in favour of her uncle Walter, 1st Earl of Atholl. Walter himself resigned the title in 1428, in favour of his son Allan, but he retained the earldom of Atholl for himself. Upon Allan&#x27;s death, Walter again came to hold both earldoms. However, both were lost when he was executed for high treason in 1437, his titles being forfeit.

The third creation of the title was for Sir George Crichton in 1452, but he surrendered the title in the same year. The final creation of the earldom was made in 1455 for William Sinclair, 3rd Earl of Orkney. He surrendered the Orkney title and all associated lands to James III in 1470, in return for the Castle of Ravenscraig, in Fife. James III had in 1469 received the rights of the king of Norway to Orkney territories as pledge of dowry of his wife Margaret of Denmark. In this way, the Scottish crown tightened its grip on Orkney and Shetland, a former Norwegian territory, by moving all other important holders away. Six years later, Earl William wished to disinherit his eldest son, who was known as &quot;the Waster&quot;. Therefore, so that his earldom would not pass to him, he resigned the title in favour of his second son from his second marriage, another William. General Arthur St. Clair was reportedly descended from George Sinclair, 4th Earl of Caithness.

George Sinclair, 6th Earl of Caithness, was the last earl to cause a disturbance in the normal succession of the title. In 1672, he agreed that, at his death, all of his lands and titles would pass to Sir John Campbell, who was his creditor. In 1677, the sixth earl died, and King Charles II granted him a patent creating him Earl of Caithness. Later, however, the sixth earl&#x27;s heir, also named George, was confirmed in his titles by the law. Therefore, in order to compensate for the loss of the earldom, Charles II created Campbell Earl of Breadalbane and Holland. Thereafter, the earldom of Caithness has passed solely within the Sinclair family, without any further resignations or other irregularities.

The Earl of Caithness also holds the title of &quot;Lord Berriedale&quot;, which was created in the Peerage of Scotland in 1455. That title is used as a courtesy title for the earl&#x27;s eldest son and heir.

<text>Statistics Belgium (abbreviated Statbel formerly known as the NSI) is part of the Federal Public Service Economy, SMEs, Self-Employed and Energy. Its legal Dutch name is , and its legal French name is .

Statistics Belgium conducts surveys among households and enterprises in Belgium. It uses and processes existing administrative databases (the national register) and provides data to Belgian and international authorities and organisations. Third parties may also call on its statistical expertise. Statistics Belgium is also the official representative of Belgium to international organisations such as Eurostat and OECD.
Sets of figures, press releases and studies are published on its website, Statbel. Moreover, a number of databases can be queried through the online application be.STAT.

== Mission and tasks ==
Its main mission can be summarized in three words: collecting, processing and disseminating relevant, reliable and commented data on Belgian society.

“Collecting” means to seek information among economic and social actors. Data are collected directly or indirectly. For surveys respondents are directly interviewed by interviewers. Indirect data collection refers to the use of administrative files (NSSO, VAT, Crossroads Bank for Enterprises...). This method is increasingly used and reduces the response burden and costs for enterprises and individuals.

“Processing” primarily means to assess data in a critical way. Results are then checked and validated by assessing their quality and their plausibility. Finally summary tables are drawn using basic data. By aggregating and comparing different types of data, Statistics Belgium adds value to initial figures.

“Disseminating” means to make collected data available to the widest public (in accordance with the rules on personal privacy):

* Authorities (all Belgian political authorities at any level, but also international authorities and organisations); 
* Enterprises (all enterprises regardless of their size or their interests); 
* Society (researchers, journalists, professors, students and others)
Statistics Belgium disseminates statistical information on:
* Households (population figures, household budget, time use, holiday habits...);
* Industry, construction, trade and other services (data from surveys among enterprises);
* Economic situation such as indexes (e.g. consumer price index) and economic indicators on industrial production, investments, export, employment, retail activity, services sector...

== Surveys ==
The surveys conducted by Statistics Belgium include surveys on labour force, income and living conditions, structure and distribution of earnings, structural business statistics, agriculture, Census 2011 (formerly known as “population count”) and household budget.

Statistics Belgium also conducts several major surveys in collaboration with other institutions. Examples include the health survey conducted by the Scientific Institute of Public Health and the time use survey carried out by the TOR research group from the &quot;Vrije Universiteit Brussel&quot;. Other public institutions may call on its expertise.

<doc id="447181" wikidata="Q2343600" url="?curid=447181" title="Weierstrass elliptic function">
<text>In mathematics, the Weierstrass elliptic functions are elliptic functions that take a particularly simple form. They are named for Karl Weierstrass. This class of functions is also referred to as ℘-functions and they are usually denoted by the symbol ℘, a uniquely fancy script &quot;p&quot;. They play an important role in the theory of elliptic functions, i.e., meromorphic functions that are doubly periodic. A ℘-function together with its derivative can be used to parameterize elliptic curves and they generate the field of elliptic functions with respect to a given period lattice. 

Symbol for Weierstrass formula_1-function

== Motivation ==
A cubic of the form formula_2, where formula_3 are complex numbers with formula_4, cannot be rationally parameterized. Yet one still wants to find a way to parameterize it.

For the quadric formula_5; the unit circle, there exists a (non-rational) parameterization using the sine function and its derivative the cosine function:
formula_6
Because of the periodicity of the sine and cosine formula_7 is chosen to be the domain, so the function is bijective.

In a similar way one can get a parameterization of formula_8 by means of the doubly periodic formula_9-function (see in the section &quot;Relation to elliptic curves&quot;). This parameterization has the domain formula_10, which is topologically equivalent to a torus.

There is another analogy to the trigonometric functions. Consider the integral function
formula_11
It can be simplified by substituting formula_12 and formula_13:
formula_14
That means formula_15. So the sine function is an inverse function of an integral function.

Elliptic functions are the inverse functions of elliptic integrals. In particular, let:
formula_16
Then the extension of formula_17 to the complex plane equals the formula_9-function. This invertibility is used in complex analysis to provide a solution to certain nonlinear differential equations satisfying the Painlevé property, i.e., those equations that admit poles as their only movable singularities.

==Definition==
Let formula_19 be two complex numbers that are linearly independent over formula_20 and let formula_21 be the period lattice generated by those numbers. Then the formula_1-function is defined as follows:
:formula_23
This series converges locally uniformly absolutely in the complex torus formula_24.

It is common to use formula_25 and formula_26 in the upper half-plane formula_27 as generators of the lattice. Dividing by formula_28 maps the lattice formula_29 isomorphically onto the lattice formula_30 with formula_31. Because formula_32 can be substituted for formula_26, without loss of generality we can assume formula_34, and then define formula_35.

== Properties ==
* formula_1 is a meromorphic function with a pole of order 2 at each period formula_37 in formula_38.
* formula_1 is an even function. That means formula_40 for all formula_41, which can be seen in the following way:
::formula_42
:The second last equality holds because formula_43. Since the sum converges absolutely this rearrangement does not change the limit.
* The derivative of formula_1 is given by: formula_45
* formula_1 and formula_47 are doubly periodic with the periods formula_48 and formula_49. This means: formula_50 It follows that formula_51 and formula_52 for all formula_53.

== Laurent expansion ==
Let formula_54
is the divisor function and formula_55 is the nome.

===Modular discriminant===
The &quot;modular discriminant&quot; Δ is defined as the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial of the differential equation formula_56 as follows:
formula_57
The discriminant is a modular form of weight 12. That is, under the action of the modular group, it transforms as
formula_58
where formula_59 with &quot;ad&quot; − &quot;bc&quot; = 1.

Note that formula_60 where formula_61 is the Dedekind eta function.

For the Fourier coefficients of formula_62, see Ramanujan tau function.

===The constants &quot;e&quot;1, &quot;e&quot;2 and &quot;e&quot;3===
formula_63, formula_64 and formula_65 are usually used to denote the values of the formula_1-function at the half-periods.
formula_67
formula_68
formula_69
They are pairwise distinct and only depend on the lattice formula_38 and not on its generators.

formula_63, formula_64 and formula_65 are the roots of the cubic polynomial formula_74 and are related by the equation:
formula_75
Because those roots are distinct the discriminant formula_62 does not vanish on the upper half plane. Now we can rewrite the differential equation:
formula_77
That means the half-periods are zeros of formula_47.

The invariants formula_79 and formula_80 can be expressed in terms of these constants in the following way:
formula_81
formula_82
formula_63, formula_64 and formula_65 are related to the modular lambda function:
formula_86

==Relation to Jacobi&#x27;s elliptic functions==

For numerical work, it is often convenient to calculate the Weierstrass elliptic function in terms of Jacobi&#x27;s elliptic functions.

The basic relations are:
formula_87
where formula_88 and formula_65 are the three roots described above and where the modulus &quot;k&quot; of the Jacobi functions equals
formula_90
and their argument &quot;w&quot; equals
formula_91

== Relation to Jacobi&#x27;s theta functions ==
The function formula_92 can be represented by Jacobi&#x27;s theta functions:
formula_93
where formula_55 is the nome and formula_26 is the period ratio formula_96. This also provides a very rapid algorithm for computing formula_97.

== Relation to elliptic curves ==

Consider the embedding of the cubic curve in the complex projective plane
:formula_98

For this cubic there exists no rational parameterization, if formula_99. In this case it is also called an elliptic curve. Nevertheless there is a parameterization in homogeneous coordinates that uses the formula_1-function and its derivative formula_47:
:formula_102

Now the map formula_103 is bijective and parameterizes the elliptic curve formula_104.

formula_10 is an abelian group and a topological space, equipped with the quotient topology.

It can be shown that every Weierstrass cubic is given in such a way. That is to say that for every pair formula_3 with formula_107 there exists a lattice formula_29, such that

formula_109 and formula_110.

The statement that elliptic curves over formula_111 can be parameterized over formula_111, is known as the modularity theorem. This is an important theorem in number theory. It was part of Andrew Wiles&#x27; proof (1995) of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

==Addition theorems==
Let formula_113, so that formula_114. Then one has:
formula_115

As well as the duplication formula:
formula_116

These formulas also have a geometric interpretation, if one looks at the elliptic curve formula_117 together with the mapping formula_118 as in the previous section.

The group structure of formula_119 translates to the curve formula_117 and can be geometrically interpreted there:

The sum of three pairwise different points formula_121 is zero if and only if they lie on the same line in formula_122.

This is equivalent to:
formula_123
where formula_124, formula_125 and formula_126.

== Typography ==
The Weierstrass&#x27;s elliptic function is usually written with a rather special, lower case script letter ℘, which was Weierstrass&#x27;s own notation introduced in his lectures of 1862–1863. It should not be confused with the normal mathematical script letters P: 𝒫 and 𝓅.

In computing, the letter ℘ is available as codice_1 in TeX. In Unicode the code point is , with the more correct alias . In HTML, it can be escaped as codice_2.

<text>The Hudson Valley (also known as the Hudson River Valley) comprises the valley of the Hudson River and its adjacent communities in the U.S. state of New York. The region stretches from the Capital District including Albany and Troy south to Yonkers in Westchester County, bordering New York City.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian era===
The Hudson Valley was inhabited by indigenous peoples long before European settlers arrived. The Lenape, Wappinger, and Mahican branches of the Algonquins lived along the river, mostly in peace with the other groups. The lower Hudson River was inhabited by the Lenape. The Lenape people waited for the explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano onshore, traded with Henry Hudson, and sold the island of Manhattan. Further north, the Wappingers lived from Manhattan Island up to Poughkeepsie. They lived a similar lifestyle to the Lenape, residing in various villages along the river. They traded with both the Lenape to the south and the Mahicans to the north. The Mahicans lived in the northern valley from present-day Kingston to Lake Champlain, with their capital located near present-day Albany. The Algonquins in the region lived mainly in small clans and villages throughout the area. One major fortress was called Navish, which was located at Croton Point, overlooking the Hudson River. Other fortresses were located in various locations throughout the Hudson Highlands.

===Hudson River exploration===
In 1497, John Cabot traveled along the coast and claimed the entire country for England; he is credited with the Old World&#x27;s discovery of continental North America. Between then and about 1609, exploration took place around New York Bay, but not into the Hudson Valley. In 1609, the Dutch East India Company financed English navigator Henry Hudson in his attempt to search for the Northwest Passage. During this attempt, Henry Hudson decided to sail his ship up the river that would later be named after him. As he continued up the river, its width expanded, into Haverstraw Bay, leading him to believe he had successfully reached the Northwest Passage. He also proceeded upstream as far as present-day Troy before concluding that no such strait existed there.

===Colonization===
After Henry Hudson realized that the Hudson River was not the Northwest Passage, the Dutch began to examine the region for potential trading opportunities. Dutch explorer and merchant Adriaen Block led voyages there between 1611 and 1614, which led the Dutch to determine that fur trade would be profitable in the region. As such, the Dutch established the colony of New Netherland. The Dutch settled three major fur-trading outposts in the colony, along the river, south to north: New Amsterdam, Wiltwyck, and Fort Orange. New Amsterdam later became known as New York City, Wiltwyck became Kingston, and Fort Orange became Albany. In 1664, the British invaded New Netherland via the port of New Amsterdam. New Amsterdam and New Netherland as a whole were surrendered to the British and renamed New York.

Under British colonial rule, the Hudson Valley became an agricultural hub, with manors being developed on the east side of the river. At these manors, landlords rented out land to their tenants, letting them take a share of the crops grown while keeping and selling the rest of the crops. Tenants were often kept at a subsistence level so that the landlord could minimize his costs. Landlords held immense political power in the colony due to driving such a large proportion of the agricultural output. Meanwhile, land west of Hudson River contained smaller landholdings with many small farmers living off the land. A large crop grown in the region was grain, which was largely shipped downriver to New York City, the colony&#x27;s main seaport, for export back to Great Britain. In order to export the grain, colonial merchants were given monopolies to grind the grain into flour and export it. Grain production was also at high levels in the Mohawk River Valley.

===Revolutionary War===

The Hudson River was a key river during the Revolutionary War. The Hudson&#x27;s connection to the Mohawk River allowed travelers to get to the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River eventually. In addition, the river&#x27;s close proximity to Lake George and Lake Champlain would allow the British navy to control the water route from Montreal to New York City. In doing so, the British, under General John Burgoyne&#x27;s strategy, would be able to cut off the patriot hub of New England (which is on the eastern side of the Hudson River) and focus on rallying the support of loyalists in the South and Mid-Atlantic regions. The British knew that total occupation of the colonies would be unfeasible, which is why this strategy was chosen. As a result of the strategy, numerous battles were fought along the river, including several in the Hudson Valley.

===Industrial Revolution===
In the early 19th century, popularized by the stories of Washington Irving, the Hudson Valley gained a reputation as a somewhat gothic region characterized by remnants of the early days of the Dutch colonization of New York (see &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;). The area is also associated with the Hudson River School, a group of American Romantic painters who worked from about 1830 to 1870.

Following the building of the Erie Canal, the area became an important industrial center. The canal opened the Hudson Valley and New York City to commerce with the Midwest and Great Lakes regions. However, in the mid 20th century, many of the industrial towns went into decline.

The first railroad in New York, the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, opened in 1831 between Albany and Schenectady on the Mohawk River, enabling passengers to bypass the slowest part of the Erie Canal. The Hudson Valley proved attractive for railroads once technology progressed to the point where it was feasible to construct the required bridges over tributaries. The Troy and Greenbush Railroad was chartered in 1845 and opened that same year, running a short distance on the east side between Troy and Greenbush, now known as East Greenbush (east of Albany). The Hudson River Railroad was chartered the next year as a continuation of the Troy and Greenbush south to New York City, and was completed in 1851. In 1866, the Hudson River Bridge opened over the river between Greenbush and Albany, enabling through traffic between the Hudson River Railroad and the New York Central Railroad west to Buffalo. When the Poughkeepsie Bridge opened in 1889, it became the longest single-span bridge in the world.

The New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway began at Weehawken Terminal and ran up the west shore of the Hudson as a competitor to the merged New York Central and Hudson River Railroad. Construction was slow and was finally completed in 1884; the New York Central purchased the line the next year.

During the Industrial Revolution, the Hudson River Valley became a major location for production. The river allowed for fast and easy transport of goods from the interior of the Northeast to the coast. Hundreds of factories were built around the Hudson, in towns including Poughkeepsie, Newburgh, Kingston, and Hudson. The North Tarrytown Assembly (later owned by General Motors), on the river in Sleepy Hollow, was a large and notable example. The river links to the Erie Canal and the Great Lakes, which allowed manufacturers in the Midwest, including automobile factories in Detroit, to use the river for transport. With industrialization came new technologies, such as streamboats, for faster transport. In 1807, the &quot;North River Steamboat&quot; (later known as Clermont), became the first commercially successful steamboat. It carried passengers between New York City and Albany along the Hudson River. At the end of the 19th century, the Hudson River region of New York State would become the world&#x27;s largest brick manufacturing region, with 130 brickyards lining the shores of the Hudson River from Mechanicsville to Haverstraw and employing 8,000 people. At its peak, about 1 billion bricks a year were produced, with many being sent to New York City for use in its construction industry.

Tourism became a major industry as early as 1810. With convenient steamboat connections in New York City and numerous attractive hotels in romantic settings, tourism became an important industry. Early guidebooks provided suggestions for travel itineraries. Middle-class people who read James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s novels or saw the paintings of the Hudson River School were especially attracted to the region.

==Geology and physiography==

The Hudson River valley runs primarily north to south down the eastern edge of New York State, cutting through a series of rock types including Triassic sandstones and redbeds in the south and much more ancient Precambrian gneiss in the north (and east). In the Hudson Highlands, the river enters a fjord cut during previous ice ages. To the west lie the extensive Appalachian Highlands. In the Tappan Zee region, the west side of the river has high cliffs produced by an erosion-resistant diabase; the cliffs range from in height.

The Hudson Valley is one physiographic section of the larger Ridge-and-Valley province, which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division. The northern portions of the Hudson Valley fall within the Eastern Great Lakes and Hudson Lowlands Ecoregion.

During the last ice age, the valley was filled by a large glacier that pushed south as far as Long Island. Near the end of the last ice age, the Great Lakes drained south down the Hudson River, from a large glacial lake called Lake Iroquois. Lake Ontario is the remnant of that lake. Large sand deposits remain from where Lake Iroquois drained into the Hudson; these are now part of the Rome Sand Plains.

Due to its resemblance, the Hudson River often has been described as &quot;America&#x27;s Rhine&quot;. In 1939, the magazine &quot;Life&quot; described the river as such, comparing it to the stretch of the Rhine in Central and Western Europe.

==Major industries==
===Agriculture===
The Hudson Valley has a long agricultural history and agriculture was its main industry when the region was first settled. Around the 1700s, tenant farming was highly practiced. The farms&#x27; main products were grains (predominantly wheat), though hops, maple syrup, vegetables, dairy products, honey, wool, livestock, and tobacco were produced there. The region became the breadbasket of colonial America, given that the surrounding New England and Catskills areas were more mountainous and had rockier soils. In the late 1800s, most farms transitioned from tenant farming to being family-owned, with more incentive to improve the land. Grain production moved west to the Genesee Valley, and so Hudson Valley farms specialized, especially in viticulture, berries, and orchard cultivation. Agriculture began to decline in the 19th century, and rapidly declined in the 20th century.

By the 1970s, the United States&#x27; culinary revolution began, and the Hudson Valley began to lead the farm-to-table movement, the local food movement, and sustainable agricultural practices. The fertile Black Dirt Region of the Wallkill and Schoharie valleys also began to be farmed. Dairy farms are predominant, though fruit, vegetable, poultry, meat, and maple syrup production are also common. Orchard cultivation is common in Orange, Ulster, Dutchess, and Columbia counties.

===Winemaking===

The Hudson Valley is one of the oldest winemaking and grape-growing regions in the United States, with its first vineyards planted in 1677 in current-day New Paltz. The region has experienced a resurgence in winemaking in the 21st century. Many wineries are located in the Hudson Valley, offering wine-tasting and other tours. Numerous wine festivals are held in the Hudson Valley, with themes often varying by season. Rhinebeck is home to the Hudson Valley Wine &amp; Food Fest, hosted at the Dutchess County Fairgrounds.

The region has sunlight, moisture, chalky soil, and drainage conducive to grape growing, especially grapes used in Champagne.

===Tech Valley===

Tech Valley is a marketing name for the eastern part of New York State, including the Hudson Valley and the Capital District. Originating in 1998 to promote the greater Albany area as a high-tech competitor to regions such as Silicon Valley and Boston, it has since grown to represent the counties in New York between IBM&#x27;s Westchester County plants in the south and the Canada–US border to the north. The area&#x27;s high technology ecosystem is supported by technologically focused academic institutions including Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute. Tech Valley encompasses 19 counties straddling both sides of the Adirondack Northway and the New York Thruway, and with heavy state taxpayer subsidy, has experienced significant growth in the computer hardware industry, with great strides in the nanotechnology sector, digital electronics design, and water- and electricity-dependent integrated microchip circuit manufacturing, involving companies including IBM in Armonk and its Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown, GlobalFoundries in Malta, and others. Westchester County has developed a burgeoning biotechnology sector in the 21st century, with over US$1 billion in planned private investment as of 2016, earning the county the nickname &quot;Biochester&quot;.

=== Tourism ===
The Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area promotes historic, natural, and cultural sites in 11 counties.

==Regions==
The Hudson Valley is divided into three regions: Upper, Middle, and Lower. The following is a list of the counties within the Hudson Valley sorted by region. The Lower Hudson Valley is typically considered part of the Downstate New York region due to its geographical and cultural proximity to New York City.

Lower Hudson
*Putnam
*Rockland
*Westchester

Mid-Hudson
*Dutchess
*Orange
*Ulster

Upper Hudson/Capital District
*Albany
*Columbia
*Greene
*Rensselaer
==Infrastructure==
Major interstates in the Hudson Valley include Interstate 87 (part of the New York State Thruway), a small section of Interstate 95 in Southeastern Westchester County, Interstate 287 serving Westchester and Rockland Counties, Interstate 84 serving Putnam, Dutchess, and Orange Counties, and Interstate 684 serving Westchester and Putnam Counties.

<text>Lars-Olof Mikael Jansson (born 4 September 1965) is a Swedish politician who was Leader of the Sweden Democrats (SD) from 1995 to 2005. He served as defence spokesman for the Sweden Democrats in the Riksdag from 2010 to 2018. Jansson is currently the Deputy Chairman of Alternative for Sweden.
==Biography==
===Early life===
Jansson was born in Kopparberg in 1965. He studied for a technical diploma in engineering while working in a paper mill in Örebro. He graduated with a qualification in engineering with a specialization in electrical and telecommunications from Lindeskolan school Lindesberg.

=== Political career ===
In 1990, Jansson joined the Centre Party and was for a time the second vice-president in Örebro&#x27;s Centre Party&#x27;s county organization and substitute member for the Centre Party in Vasa municipal board in Örebro. In 1993 he switched to the Sweden Democrats, where he in 1994 he was elected second vice president. In 1995 he became the new party chairman of the SD at the party congress in Norrköping replacing SD founder and original leader Anders Klarström. During Jansson&#x27;s time as leader, the Sweden Democrats took a more direct stance against political extremism and neo-fascism within its ranks and saw a gradual increase in votes during the 1990s and early 2000s. He served as chairman for 10 years. In May 2005, he was challenged for the party leadership by youth-wing chairman Jimmie Åkesson who subsequently defeated Jansson in a leadership contest to become SD chairman. The same year, he released the book &quot;I eget spår genom obruten terräng&quot; about his time as party leader.

He served as head of the local party district in Gothenburg from 1995-2014 and in the 2006 elections he was elected to the City Council in Gothenburg and also set up as a third candidate to the European Parliament in 2009 on the party&#x27;s behalf.

Mikael Jansson was the Sweden Democrats&#x27; candidate for the post of Second Deputy Speaker of the Riksdag in 2010, but was not elected. Since 2010, he has been a member of parliament, a member of the defence committee, and a spokesperson for the party. During the years 2012–2014, Jansson was a member of the defence commission, which examines future defence policy.

Mikael Jansson is also one of twelve members in the Swedish Export Control Council (ECC), a parliamentary appointed group that advise the Inspectorate of Strategic Products (ISP) on how to deal with war material export issues. The Sweden Democrats party have one seat in total in the council.

On 1 February 2017 the Swedish government decided to start a new defence commission that will be finished in May 2019. Jansson was appointed representative for the Sweden Democrats party.

On 9 April 2018 he defected to the SD breakaway Alternative for Sweden citing the SD&#x27;s shift in policy to be more open to NATO membership. He lost his seat in the general election held that year.

== Controversies ==

In the fall of 2016 before the US election, Jansson chose to publicly go out in the Swedish media by writing an article in one of Sweden&#x27;s largest newspaper Expressen saying &quot;Should the United States maintain its superpower status it will require that someone will take a series of difficult decisions &quot; and attacking President Obama&#x27;s foreign policy, saying &quot;American foreign policy, both have been cynical, cruel and has failed.&quot;. Mikael Jansson had not cleared the article within his party and did not have the party&#x27;s support.

The Sweden Democrats party leader Jimmie Åkesson, as well as all other 348 members of parliament from all parties, declared most of them either supported Hillary Clinton or did not want to choose. Jansson was invited to several TV and radio interviews where he chose to defend his earlier statement that &quot;Donald Trump was the best choice not only for the USA but for Europe and Sweden as well&quot;. Several Swedish media called it shocking and Sweden&#x27;s Minister for Justice and Migration Morgan Johansson from the Social Democrats party said on Twitter &quot;Mikael Jansson (SD) supports Trump. Not surprisingly. Haters holding together.&quot;

<text>Pincher Martin (published in America as Pincher Martin: The Two Deaths of Christopher Martin) is a novel by British writer William Golding, first published in 1956. It is Golding&#x27;s third novel, following &quot;The Inheritors&quot; and his debut &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;.

The novel is one of Golding&#x27;s best-known novels, and is noted for being existential and minimalistic in setting.

==Plot==
The plot of &quot;Pincher Martin&quot; surrounds the survival and psychophysical, spiritual and existential plight of one Christopher Hadley &quot;Pincher&quot; Martin, a temporary naval lieutenant who believes himself to be the sole survivor of a military torpedo destroyer which sinks in the North Atlantic Ocean. At the start of the novel Martin is in the water and desperately fighting for his life. He is apparently saved after being providentially washed ashore a rocky mid-Atlantic islet. He deduces that his naval crew is dead and begins his grim struggle for survival but, as time goes by, a series of strange and increasingly terrifying events, which he at first dismisses as hallucinations, slowly provokes in him an existential crisis.

Throughout the novel Golding juxtaposes themes of sanity and insanity, and reality and unreality. At first Martin is portrayed as a thinking individual, who uses his intelligence, education and training to source food, collect fresh water and alert any potential rescuers. It is in fact during this rational phase that Martin is at his most delusional. It is only when insanity takes hold that he begins to comprehend the reality of his predicament: &quot;There is a pattern emerging. I do not know what the pattern is but even my dim guess at it makes my reason falter&quot;.

The novel&#x27;s twist ending reveals that Martin actually drowned shortly after his ship was sunk. When his body is found it is noted that &quot;he didn&#x27;t even have time to kick off his seaboots&quot;. This means that his struggle for survival on the island never actually happened, which changes the work into an allegory of purgatory and damnation. In the &quot;Radio Times&quot; of 21 March 1958, Golding explains that Martin driven by a selfish greed for life has continued to exist in another dimension: &quot;His drowned body lies rolling in the Atlantic but the ravenous ego invents a rock for him to endure on&quot;.

==Setting==
The North Atlantic islet in question is described in the novel as very small, rocky, barren and remote, &quot;only appearing on weather charts&quot;. (&quot;A single point of rock, peak of a mountain range, one tooth set in the ancient jaw of a sunken world, projecting through the inconceivable vastness of the whole ocean.&quot;) A captain is quoted as saying &quot;I call that name a near miss.&quot;

<text>Chocky is a science fiction novel by British writer John Wyndham. It was first published as a novelette in the March 1963 issue of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; and later developed into a novel in 1968, published by Michael Joseph. The BBC produced a radio adaption by John Tydeman in 1967. In 1984 a children&#x27;s television drama based on the novel was shown on ITV in the United Kingdom.

==Plot summary==
David Gore becomes concerned that his twelve-year-old son, Matthew, is too old to have an imaginary friend. His concerns deepen as Matthew becomes increasingly distressed and blames it on arguments with this unseen companion, whom he calls &quot;Chocky&quot;. As the story unfolds it becomes clear that the friend is far from imaginary but is an alien consciousness communicating with Matthew&#x27;s mind. The situation attracts the interest of shadowy government forces.

&quot;Chocky&quot; eventually reveals that it is a scout sent from its home planet (where there is only one sex) in search of new planets to colonise, or newly emerging intelligent life that it can subtly guide. Chocky, talking through Matthew, explains to David that in becoming overly attached to Matthew and saving him and his sister from drowning (and thus interfering with events on Earth) it has violated the rules of its scout mission and must end its link with him completely. Its further work on Earth will be conducted in a much more covert manner.

==Adaptations==

<text>Vinko Žganec (January 22, 1890 - December 12, 1976) was a Croatian ethnomusicologist.

Žganec was born in Vratišinec in Međimurje. He started to be interested in music early in his childhood and jotted down his first folk song in 1908. In 1916, he published his first book of Croatian folk songs from Međimurje. Later he extended the work to cover the Bunjevci Croats in Hungary and Croats from Gradišće in Austria. He studied theology and later law, becoming a Doctor of Law in 1919.

The composer and ethnomusicologist Béla Bartók kept in close contact with him while collecting folk songs along the border of Hungary and Croatia. Bartók respected Žganec because of both the accuracy of his research and the notation. Music started to be his primary focus in 1945 when he became the head of the Ethnographic Museum in Zagreb. During the span of his research, Žganec collected, recorded, and wrote down more than 19,000 songs, including many Croatian tamburica; these have been preserved for future generations to be used and studied. There is some evidence that he collected more than 25,000 songs (15,000 just from his native Međimurje). Some of them were not entirely documented.

Žganec became the first director of the Institute of Folklore Research, and was an active participant in the Folklorist Society of Croatia. He taught at the Academy of Music in Zagreb where he was a great influence on his colleagues and students. Similar to Žganec&#x27;s work was that of Franjo Kuhač, another man who devoted his life to research on the national cultural heritage.

<text>Samson and Delilah is a 1949 American epic romantic biblical drama film produced and directed by Cecil B. DeMille and released by Paramount Pictures. It depicts the biblical story of Samson, a strongman whose secret lies in his uncut hair, and his love for Delilah, the woman who seduces him, discovers his secret, and then betrays him to the Philistines. It stars Victor Mature and Hedy Lamarr in the title roles, George Sanders as the Saran, Angela Lansbury as Semadar, and Henry Wilcoxon as Prince Ahtur.

Pre-production on the film began as early as 1935, but principal photography officially commenced in 1948. The screenplay, written by Jesse L. Lasky Jr. and Fredric M. Frank, is based on the biblical Book of Judges and adapted from an original film treatment by Harold Lamb, also drawing from Vladimir Jabotinsky&#x27;s 1927 novel &quot;Samson the Nazirite&quot;.

Upon its release, the film was praised for its Technicolor cinematography, lead performances, costumes, sets, and innovative special effects. After premiering in New York City on 21 December 1949, &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; opened in Los Angeles on 13 January 1950. A massive commercial success, it became the highest-grossing film of 1950, and the third highest-grossing film ever at the time of its release. Of its five Academy Award nominations, the film won two for Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.

== Plot ==
Samson, a Danite Hebrew placed under Nazirite vows from birth by his mother Hazelelponit, is engaged to a Philistine woman named Semadar. At their wedding feast, Samson loses a bet with his wedding guests because of Semadar and attacks 30 Philistines to strip them of their cloaks to pay his betting debt.

After paying his debt, Samson searches for Semadar, only to learn that her father Tubal married her to a Philistine once Samson left the wedding to pay his debt. A fight breaks out between Samson and the Philistines, which results in the death of Semadar and Tubal. Samson becomes a hunted man, and in his fury he begins fighting the Philistines.

The Saran of Gaza imposes heavy taxes on the Danites, with the purpose of having Samson betrayed by his own people. The Saran&#x27;s plan works, and frustrated Danites hand over Samson to the Philistines, much to the joy of Delilah, Semadar&#x27;s younger sister. Samson is taken by Prince Ahtur. He was, in other words, the military governor of the land of Dan, and a regiment of Philistine troops. En route back to Gaza, Ahtur decides to taunt Samson. Samson rips apart his chains and ropes and begins to combat the Philistines, toppling Ahtur&#x27;s war chariot and using the jawbone of a donkey to club the Philistine soldiers to death.

News of the defeat of Ahtur at the hands of Samson reaches the Saran. The Saran ponders how to defeat Samson. Delilah comes up with the idea of seducing Samson, thus having him reveal the secret of his strength and then deliver him for punishment. Her plan works; she cuts his hair, which gives him his strength. To fully neutralize him, Samson is blinded by his captors and put to slave work, and is eventually brought to the temple of Dagon for the entertainment of the Philistines and the Saran. However, Delilah has been in love with Samson ever since his engagement with Semadar, and his blindness and torture make her feel deep remorse over her betrayal. She initially had betrayed him because she wanted to avenge the deaths of her father and sister, which she thought were caused &quot;because of Samson.&quot;

Delilah later attends the public torture of Samson wielding a whip, which she uses to guide him to the temple&#x27;s main support pillars. Once he stands between them, he tells Delilah to flee, but she remains, unseen by him, as he pushes the pillars apart. The pillars give way and the temple collapses, burying Samson, Delilah, and all the Philistines, including the court. In the end, the temple lies in rubble, and Saul and Miriam, his two closest Danite Hebrew friends, are left to mourn Samson&#x27;s death.

== Production ==

=== Development ===

In April 1934, Paramount Pictures announced that its next &quot;big picture&quot; and DeMille&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1934) would be &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;, starring Henry Wilcoxon and Miriam Hopkins in the title roles. The film was eventually postponed and DeMille decided to produce and direct &quot;The Crusades&quot; (1935).

In May 1935, &quot;Motion Picture Daily&quot; informed that &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; was &quot;slated to start five weeks after the completion of &quot;The Crusades&quot;.&quot; Paramount bought the film rights to the music and libretto of the 1877 opera &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot;. DeMille paid $10,000 to historian Harold Lamb to write a film treatment of the biblical story of Samson and Delilah, which DeMille regarded as &quot;one of the greatest love stories of all time.&quot; Jeanie MacPherson was also hired to do research and collaborate with Lamb on the screenplay. DeMille considered filming it in the new three-strip Technicolor. After the release of &quot;The Crusades&quot;, Paramount negotiated a new contract with DeMille and cancelled &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; in 1936.

Ten years later, on August 15, 1946, DeMille publicly stated that &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; would be his next project after &quot;Unconquered&quot; (1947). DeMille later recalled in his autobiography that the Paramount executives had doubts about financing a &quot;Sunday school tale.&quot; They approved the project when DeMille showed them a sketch by artist Dan Groesbeck depicting a &quot;big, brawny&quot; Samson and a &quot;slim and ravishingly attractive&quot; Delilah. He initially planned to film it in 1947, but in October 1947, he said he would produce the film the following year with a &quot;budget to be based on the anticipated world gross at that time.&quot;

In spring of 1948, DeMille hired illustrator Henry Clive to paint the &quot;ideal Delilah&quot; on canvas. He had studied paintings of Delilah by Peter Paul Rubens, Rembrandt, Gustave Doré, and Solomon Joseph Solomon, but wanted her to look modern. DeMille said his Delilah &quot;must have a dangerous capacity for vengeance. Warm, soft, cunning. A combination of Vivien Leigh and Jean Simmons with a dash of Lana Turner.&quot; In July, he hired Henry Noerdlinger as a research coordinator.

Adding to his dramatization of the biblical story, DeMille bought the rights to &quot;Samson the Nazirite&quot; (published in the United States as &quot;Judge and Fool&quot;), a 1927 novel by Vladimir Jabotinsky, who portrayed Delilah as the younger sister of Samson&#x27;s Philistine wife. 

Despite the renown of this iconic biblical story depicting their battle against the Philistines, the oppressed people represented by Samson are never once referred to as &quot;Israelites&quot;, &quot;Hebrews&quot; or &quot;Jewish&quot; people. They are referred to only as Danites, members of the Tribe of Dan. This omission—or avoidance—occurred in the early days of the witch hunt into Communist—often Jewish—influence when Hollywood studio chiefs were very sensitive to the fact that the film industry was generally considered to be run by Jews.

Jesse L. Lasky Jr. and Fredric M. Frank completed the 186-page script on September 7, 1948.

=== Casting ===

When he first planned the film in 1934, DeMille chose Paramount contract player Miriam Hopkins as Delilah and his new star Henry Wilcoxon as Samson. The following year, he was considering other actors for those roles. In July 1935, columnist Louella Parsons reported that the director wanted to borrow James Cagney from Warner Bros. for the role of Samson. In November, actresses Dolores del Río, Paulette Goddard, and Joan Crawford were suggested for the part of Delilah, a role Grace Bradley wanted to play and also campaigned for. In April 1936, he thought dancer Sally Rand could be &quot;the perfect beautiful brute&quot; as Delilah. In October, DeMille signed a new contract with Paramount and said he was making a deal with Charles Bickford for Samson and asked Claudette Colbert to play Delilah. By the end of 1936, the film was &quot;indefinitely&quot; shelved.

Twelve years later, when he restarted his plans for the film, DeMille stated, &quot;For Samson, I want a combination Tarzan, Robin Hood, and Superman.&quot; As early as December 1947, DeMille informed that he wanted to borrow Victor Mature from 20th Century Fox for the role. In January 1948, columnist Erskine Johnson reported that Mature was one of DeMille&#x27;s candidates for the role. Burt Lancaster was also considered but he declined due to a bad back. Body builder Steve Reeves was another candidate and DeMille lobbied long and hard to get the studio to pick up Reeves, but both DeMille and the studio wanted Reeves to tone down his physique, which Reeves, still young and new to the industry, ultimately refused to do. In June 1948, after an 18-month search initially for an unknown &quot;athletic young man&quot;, DeMille chose Mature after admiring his performance in the film &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; (1947).

DeMille and his staff considered many film stars of various nationalities for the role of Delilah. In September 1947, he said he wanted to cast Hedy Lamarr in the role. She first caught his attention in 1939, when he planned a film starring her as the Jewish queen Esther. He had also worked with her on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;. In December, he was thinking about giving the part to Rhonda Fleming but thought she was &quot;too nice&quot; for it. In January 1948, DeMille&#x27;s assistants voted Vivien Leigh the &quot;perfect Delilah&quot;; he attempted to hire her but found out she was very ill. That same month, Ruth Roman made a screen test. In March, Jean Simmons visited Hollywood and talked with DeMille about the role. In April, DeMille was &quot;seriously considering&quot; Lizabeth Scott. Columnist Hedda Hopper recommended Ann Sheridan, who &quot;would make a luscious one.&quot; By early June, DeMille had interviewed several actresses, including Lamarr and Sheridan. He had an idea of what he was looking for in the actress: &quot;For Delilah ... a sort of distilled Jean Simmons, Vivien Leigh and a generous touch of Lana Turner.&quot; Others considered were Lucille Ball, Jeanne Crain, Linda Darnell, Ava Gardner, Greer Garson, Jane Greer, Susan Hayward, Rita Hayworth, Jennifer Jones, Viveca Lindfors, Patricia Neal, Maureen O&#x27;Hara, Nancy Olson, Gail Russell, Märta Torén, and Alida Valli.
On June 19, 1948, the press announced that DeMille chose Hedy Lamarr. According to co-star Henry Wilcoxon, Lamarr (who was of Jewish descent, as was DeMille himself on his mother&#x27;s side) won the role of Delilah after DeMille saw her film &quot;The Strange Woman&quot; (1946). Erskine Johnson revealed that Lamarr&#x27;s portrayal of Tondelayo in &quot;White Cargo&quot; (1942) ultimately convinced DeMille to hire her. Maria Montez wanted to play Delilah and was reportedly &quot;so disappointed&quot; that Lamarr got the role. Yvonne De Carlo &quot;cried into her tea cup&quot; when Lamarr was cast and said, &quot;[DeMille] told me two years ago that when he made the movie I would get the part.&quot; He was content with Lamarr&#x27;s performance as Delilah, describing it as &quot;more than skin-deep.&quot; He also described her as &quot;a gazelle–incapable of a clumsy or wrong move&quot;, and she would flirtatiously refer to herself as &quot;Delilah&quot; and DeMille as her &quot;Samson.&quot;
In July 1948, DeMille gave the role of Semadar to Phyllis Calvert, but she relinquished the part due to illness. Therefore, DeMille cast Angela Lansbury in the role in September. When Lawrence Perry of &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; interviewed Lansbury on September 24, 1949, he told her that the Bible does not describe Delilah as having a sister. Lansbury replied, &quot;Anyway, if Delilah didn&#x27;t have a sister, Mr. DeMille has supplied one.&quot;

Kasey Rogers auditioned and was screen-tested for the role of Miriam, the Danite girl who loves Samson. But DeMille told her, &quot;You&#x27;re too pretty and you&#x27;re too young&quot;, and Rogers was cast as a Philistine spectator in the temple scene and credited in the film as Laura Elliot. Rogers was given a close-up and several lines, including &quot;Why can&#x27;t I lead you like that?&quot; and &quot;It [the column] moved!&quot; The role of Miriam was given to stage actress Olive Deering, who received sixth billing after the five main stars.

William &quot;Wee Willie&quot; Davis, a local professional wrestler, was cast in the role of Garmiskar, the Saran&#x27;s wrestler who fights Samson. He was described as &quot;seven feet tall and, with his costume on, tops the scales 350 pounds.&quot;

=== Filming ===
Principal photography began on October 4, 1948 and ended on December 22, 1948. The scenes involving the plowed field were shot on January 4, 1949, and added scenes and closeups were shot between January 18 and January 21, 1949.

Victor Mature was frightened by a number of the animals and mechanical props used in the production, including the lions, the wind machine, the swords and even the water. This infuriated DeMille, who bellowed through his megaphone at the assembled cast and crew: &quot;I have met a few men in my time. Some have been afraid of heights, some have been afraid of water, some have been afraid of fire, some have been afraid of closed spaces. Some have even been afraid of open spaces -- or themselves. But in all my 35 years of picture-making experience, Mr. Mature, I have not until now met a man who was 100 percent yellow.&quot;
For an early scene with Hedy Lamarr, DeMille originally wanted Mature to fight the lion barehanded in the full shot, but Mature refused and a stunt man performed the scene. Mature appears in the close-ups. After the film&#x27;s premiere, DeMille revealed that Mature&#x27;s double &quot;got a dreadful clawing down his arm which necessitated painting the wound on Victor&#x27;s arm.&quot; &quot;Vic was leary about tangling with the critter,&quot; Lamarr confided to gossip columnist Hedda Hopper in December 1948. &quot;I told him, &#x27;Don&#x27;t be afraid. I&#x27;m not, and I&#x27;m even wearing a red dress.&#x27; He replied, &#x27;You&#x27;ve got your animals mixed. This is a lion, not a bull.&#x27; When he started closing in on the lion, the cameraman shouted, &#x27;If he jumps, Vic, try and stay in the lights.&#x27;&quot; Mature himself recounted the moment:


The film&#x27;s special effects were supervised by Gordon Jennings. The most spectacular special effect in the film is the toppling of the temple of Dagon, the god of the Philistines. It is the penultimate scene in the film, cost $150,000, and took a year to shoot. The bottom portion of the temple was constructed full-scale. A separate 37-foot high model with a 17-foot high Dagon statue was built for the photographic effects. The model was destroyed three times to shoot it through different camera angles. Footage of the full-scale set was merged with footage of the scale model using a &quot;motion repeater system&quot; fabricated by Paramount, which enabled the exact repetition of camera moves.

=== Connection with &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; ===
DeMille&#x27;s legendary status led him to play himself in Billy Wilder&#x27;s film noir &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950). The film is about a fictional silent film star named Norma Desmond (played by Gloria Swanson) who, no longer active, once worked as an actress for DeMille. For the scene in which Desmond visits DeMille at Paramount, an actual set of &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; was reconstructed to show the director at work. The first day scheduled to shoot the scene was May 23, 1949, months after filming on &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; had ended. After the scene was shot in a total of four days, Wilder patted DeMille on the back and humorously told him, &quot;Very good, my boy. Leave your name with my secretary. I may have a small part for you in my next picture.&quot; Wilder later said that DeMille &quot;took direction terrifically. He loved it. He understood it. He was very subtle.&quot;

== Release ==

&quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; received its televised world premiere on December 21, 1949, at two of New York City&#x27;s Broadway theatres, the Paramount and the Rivoli, in order to &quot;accommodate the 7,000,000 movie-goers in the greater New York area.&quot; People who attended the event included Mary Pickford, Buddy Rogers, and Barney Balaban. The film eventually went into general release on January 13, 1950.

It was successfully re-released in November 1959 following the box office triumph of Joseph E. Levine&#x27;s &quot;Hercules&quot; (1958).

=== Critical response ===

&quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; received rave reviews upon its release in 1949. &quot;Showmen&#x27;s Trade Review&quot; wrote that the film &quot;bids fair to stand as this veteran showman&#x27;s most impressive and magnificent spectacle since that history-making 1923 religious epic [&quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;].&quot; A review in &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; commented: &quot;Mr. DeMille has succeeded, not only in keeping the story authentic, but also in presenting it in a highly entertaining way. Its combination of spectacularity and human interest will grip the attention of all movie-goers.&quot; The &quot;Modern Screen&quot; reviewer remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s tremendous, impressive, and beautiful to look at.&quot; &quot;Boxoffice&quot; considered it the &quot;most prodigious spectacle ever conceived,&quot; while &quot;The Film Daily&quot; stated that it &quot;[s]tands monumental alongside any contender.&quot; &quot;The Exhibitor&quot;, a trade magazine, declared: &quot;This will be classed with the big films of all time.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; appreciated the film&#x27;s cast by writing, &quot;Victor Mature fits neatly into the role of the handsome but dumb hulk of muscle that both the Bible and DeMille make of the Samson character. Hedy Lamarr never has been more eye-filling and makes of Delilah a convincing minx. George Sanders gives a pleasantly light flavor of satirical humor to the part of the ruler, while Henry Wilcoxon is duly rugged as the military man.&quot; Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; admired the &quot;dazzling displays of splendid costumes, of sumptuous settings and softly tinted flesh which Mr. DeMille&#x27;s color cameras have brilliantly pageanted ... Color has seldom been more lushly or unmistakably used.&quot;

Film critic Leonard Maltin, in his review for &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;, wrote: &quot;With expected DeMille touches, this remains a tremendously entertaining film.&quot;

After he saw the film, Groucho Marx is said to have quipped, in language that may have been sanitized for publication, &quot;No picture can hold my interest when the leading man&#x27;s bust is bigger than the leading lady&#x27;s.&quot;

=== Box office ===
&quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; was enormously successful, earning $9 million in theatrical rentals in its initial release, thus making it the highest-grossing film of 1950. At the time of its release, it was the third highest-grossing film ever, behind &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939) and &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946). It was the second most popular film at the British box office that year.

During its theatrical reissue, in 1959, it earned another $2.5 million in distributor rentals.

=== Accolades ===

In December 1949, Cecil B. DeMille was awarded the &quot;Parents&quot;″ magazine medal for &quot;thirty-five years of devotion to research in the production of historical pictures culminating in his greatest achievement, &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;.&quot;

&quot;The Christian Herald&quot; and the Protestant Motion Picture Council presented DeMille with its December 1949 Picture of the Month Award for &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;.

In March 1950, &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; was named one of the Best Pictures of 1949 at &quot;Look&quot;″s Annual Film Awards. Cecil B. DeMille received the All Industry Achievement Award for the film.

In December 1950, DeMille received the &quot;Boxoffice&quot; Barometer Trophy as the producer of &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;, the &quot;highest-grossing picture of the year.&quot;

At the 8th Golden Globe Awards, on February 28, 1951, &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; was nominated for Best Color Cinematography (George Barnes).

At the 23rd Academy Awards on March 29, 1951, &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; won for Best Color Art Direction (art directors Hans Dreier and Walter H. Tyler and set decorators Samuel M. Comer and Ray Moyer) and Best Color Costume Design (Edith Head, Dorothy Jeakins, Elois Jenssen, Gile Steele, and Gwen Wakeling). It was also nominated for three more awards: Best Color Cinematography (George Barnes), Best Music Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture (Victor Young), and Best Special Effects (Cecil B. DeMille Productions).

In May 1951, British moviegoers voted Hedy Lamarr&#x27;s Delilah the tenth &quot;best screen performance by an actress.&quot;

In June 1952, &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; won the &quot;Film français&quot; Grand Prix for Best Foreign Film of 1951. Presented to DeMille, the Grand Prix is a small bronze replica of the &quot;Winged Victory of Samothrace&quot; displayed at the Louvre Museum.

== Home media ==
In 1979, Paramount Home Video released the film on VHS and Betamax as a two-tape set. The VHS was released again in 1981 as a single-tape release, and then again in 1988 and 1990.

MCA DiscoVision was originally set to release the film on LaserDisc as part of a set of titles from Paramount Pictures in 1978, but their version was scrapped for unknown reasons. The first LaserDisc edition of &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; was finally released in 1982. Ten years later, Paramount released a new LaserDisc edition that featured digital video transferred from a new 35mm interpositive of the original 3-strip Technicolor negatives. DiscoVision&#x27;s transfer, however, was used in the 1979 VHS and 1980s home media releases.

In 2012, a digital restoration of &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; was completed. The original three-strip Technicolor camera negatives were scanned at 4K on a Northlight scanner and then registered, cleaned, and color corrected in 4K by Technicolor Los Angeles. The original music overture was restored and the film&#x27;s original audio track was cleaned. The restored version received its premiere at Cineteca Bologna&#x27;s Il Cinema Ritrovato 2012. Paramount Home Media Distribution released the film on DVD (with English, French, and Spanish audio and subtitles) on March 12, 2013. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc (with the original theatrical trailer) on March 11, 2014.

<text>Christopher Edmark, formerly Tommy Funebo (born Tommy Niiranen March 15, 1960 in Själevad) took over from Tor Paulsson as Party Organizer of the Sverigedemokraterna (Swedish Democrats Party) at the beginning of 2001.

He was the éminence grise of the party until the end of 2003, when he claimed the party had &quot;Nazi tendencies&quot;. He rejected collaboration with Belgian antisemite Bernard Mengal and instead joined the Sveriges Pensionärers Intresseparti (Senior Citizen Interest Party). He later became a Social democrat, and later a libertarian.

<text>Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines (OEF-P) or Operation Freedom Eagle was part of Operation Enduring Freedom and the global War on Terror. The Operation targeted the various Jihadist terror groups operating in the country. By 2009, about 600 U.S. military personnel were advising and assisting the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in the Southern Philippines. In addition, by 2014, the CIA had sent its elite paramilitary officers from their Special Activities Division to hunt down and kill or capture key terrorist leaders. This group had the most success in combating and capturing Al-Qaeda leaders and the leaders of associated groups like Abu Sayyaf.

== Major battles ==
The Zamboanga City Crisis (commonly known as the Zamboanga siege) was fought in 2014 by Philippine troops against the MILF/MNLF. It was a joint collaboration between the Philippine National Police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines. It was a turning point during this Operation. During this time, the M.N.L.F and the M.I.L.F launched a series of propaganda campaigns against the Philippine Armed Forces including through the use of social media (even if it&#x27;s rare it was a big problem for there&#x27;s a probability the A.F.P could lose morale. But in the end, it was a major strategic victory for the Philippine Armed Forces and the PNP.

The Marawi Siege was a siege by a coalition of nations militarily and strategically, perpetrated by the Maute Group. In the end, it cost the lives of thousands of people and displaced almost of the entire city&#x27;s population to other settlements. The siege lasted for almost 200 days. The coalition of nations during the siege included China, the United States, Russia, and many other nations.

Siege of Zamboanga was a conflict which occurred during September 2013 against insurgents of the Moro National Liberation Front. It would be suppressed later in the month by combined Filipino military forces, at the cost of population displacement and damage to civilian infrastructure.

==Background==

The 1898 Treaty of Paris ended the Spanish–American War, with Spain ceding the Philippines to the United States. Islam had arrived in the Philippines before the Spanish. Spain had conquered the northern islands, and the southern islands had become the Sultanate of Sulu (which was a Spanish protectorate, but not under direct administration). The Spanish cession included the islands of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, and the ceded territory included the islands of the Sultanate of Sulu located in the Philippine archipelago where slavery and piracy had for centuries been practiced by the Moros. The Spanish had established coastal garrisons but had never controlled the jungle interiors of the islands.

In 1899, U.S. Brigadier General John C. Bates negotiated the Kiram-Bates Treaty for American Sovereignty over the Moro land, which recognized and respected the position of the Sultan and the Sultanate as well as their Muslim traditions, laws, and practices with the Sultan of Sulu. After the U.S. had completed its goal of suppressing the resistance in Luzon in the Spanish–American War, it unilaterally abrogated the Bates Treaty on March 2, 1904, claiming the Sultan had failed to quell Moro resistance and that the treaty was a hindrance to the effective colonial administration of the area. Bates later confessed that the agreement was merely a temporary expedient to buy time until the northern forces were defeated.

==Forces==
Special Operations Command, Pacific (SOCPAC) troops were the core of Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines (OEF-P), an operation which supports the Government of the Republic of the Philippines counterterrorism efforts. The AFP and civilian authorities had improved their ability to coordinate and sustain counterterrorism operations. U.S. and Philippine forces had also worked together under the new Security Engagement Board framework – the primary mechanism for consultation and planning
regarding non-traditional security threats – to complete humanitarian and civil assistance projects and improve living conditions in the southern Philippines. As a result of their combined efforts, support for terrorists had waned markedly.

Deployment first began January 2002 and involved more than 1,200 members of SOCPAC, headed by Brig. General Donald C. Wurster. SOCPAC&#x27;s deployable joint task force HQ, Joint Task Force 510 (JTF 510), directed and carried out the operation.

The mission was to advise the Armed Forces of the Philippines in combating terrorism in the Philippines. 160 U.S. special forces go out on patrol with Filipinos in jungles of Basilan island, an Abu Sayyaf stronghold, in 2002, U.S. military personnel deployed to Cebu to provide support for a six-month exercise. The Navy sent SEAL &amp; Special Boat Teams to aide with maritime operations against piracy, trafficking, and port/waterways security. Mark V Special Operations Craft operated by SWCC boat operators were used to conduct Visit, board, search, and seizure operations. Some unconventional tactics and equipment were used, such as utilizing canoes with outboard motors, various small boats, and jetskis for low-profile collection operations. JSOC could undertake psychological operations to confuse or trap al-Qaeda operatives, but it needed approval from the White House for lethal action. Much of the mission (Exercise Balikatan 02–1) took place on the Basilan Island.

==Mission==
The mission of the Joint Special Operations Task Force in the Philippines (JSOTF-P) was
==Combatants==

===Armed Forces of the Philippines===
===United States Armed Forces===

The United States had provided the Philippine government with advisors, equipment and financial support to counter Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah. In order to provide a legal basis for the presence of U.S. forces despite provisions in the 1987 Philippine constitution specifically banning the presence of foreign troops, Philippine president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo invoked the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty between the U.S. and the Philippines. In 2013, operations began to wind down, assisting Philippine forces against Muslim rebels in September 2013. Joint Special Operations Task Force - Philippines disbanded in June 2014, ending a successful 12-year mission.

====Timeline of American casualties====
On 21 February 2002, the largest loss of life for U.S. forces occurred when 10 soldiers (8 from the E company, 160th SOAR and 2 from the 353rd Special Operations Group) were killed after their MH-47 crashed at sea in the Bohol Strait, southern Philippines, whilst scouting Islamic terrorists on Basilan Island.

On 2 October 2002, a bombing at an open-air market outside the gate of Camp Enrile Malagutay in Zamboanga killed a U.S. Special Forces soldier from A Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st SFG.
One Filipino soldier and one civilian were also killed, and 21 people were wounded including one U.S. and two Filipino soldiers.

On 30 June 2004, a U.S. Special Forces soldier from 2nd Battalion, 1st SFG, was killed in a non-hostile incident in Manila.

On 14 October 2005, a U.S. Special Forces soldier from 5th Battalion, 4th Psychological Operations Group, U.S. Army Special Operations Command. was killed in a non-hostile incident in Makati City.

On 15 February 2007, a U.S. Marine from Combat Logistics Regiment 37, 3rd Marine Logistics Group was killed in a non-hostile incident in Jolo.

On 27 October 2007, a U.S. Special Forces soldier from 2nd Battalion, 1st SFG was killed in an accidental drowning incident at Lake Seit in the southern Philippines.

On 29 September 2009, a roadside bomb killed two U.S. Special Forces soldiers from 3rd battalion, 1st SFG and a Philippine Marine on Jolo island. Three other Philippine service members were injured in the blast. It was initially reported that the two U.S. casualties were Seabees.

===Abu Sayyaf===

The Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) is deemed a &quot;foreign terrorist organization&quot; by the United States government. Specifically, it is an Islamist separatist group based in and around the southern islands of the Republic of the Philippines, primarily Jolo, Basilan, and Mindanao.

Since inception in the early 1990s, the group has carried out bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, and extortion in their fight for an independent Islamic state in western Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, with a claimed overarching goal of creating a Pan-Islamic superstate across the &quot;Malay&quot; portions of Southeast Asia, spanning, from east to west, the large island of Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago (Basilan and Jolo islands), the large island of Borneo (Malaysia and Indonesia), the South China Sea, and the Malay Peninsula (Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand and Burma).

The name of the group is Arabic for &quot;Father&quot; (Abu) &quot;of the Sword&quot; (Sayyaf).

===Jemaah Islamiyah===

Jemaah Islamiyah is a militant Islamic terrorist organization dedicated to the establishment of a fundamentalist Islamic theocracy in Southeast Asia, in particular Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, the south of Thailand and the Philippines.

Jemaah Islamiyah is thought to have killed hundreds of civilians and is suspected of having executed the Bali car bombing on 12 October 2002 in which suicide bombers killed 202 people, mostly Australian tourists, and wounded many in a nightclub. After this attack, the U.S. State Department designated Jemaah Islamiyah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Jemaah Islamiyah is also suspected of carrying out the Zamboanga bombings, the Rizal Day Bombings, the 2004 Jakarta embassy bombing and the 2005 Bali terrorist bombing.

Financial links between Jemaah Islamiyah and other terrorist groups, such as Abu Sayyaf and al-Qaeda, have been found to exist. Jemaah Islamiyah means &quot;Islamic Group&quot; and is often abbreviated JI.

==Balikatan training exercises==

The Balikatan training exercises were a part of OEF – Philippines which are mainly a series of joint training exercises between the Philippines and the United States. These training exercises are mainly taking place in Mindanao, the Spratly Islands, Tarlac, and other parts in the Philippines. The Balikatan training exercises are focused on joint training and counter-terrorist training aimed on strengthening relations between the Philippines, Moro and the United States. The Balikatan training exercises are also aimed on training Filipino forces to fight the Abu Sayyaf and other Jihadist terror groups.

There have been allegations in the Philippine press and elsewhere that visiting forces from the United States appear to have become a permanent fixture in the landscape of Zamboanga City and other parts of Mindanao. Former presidential executive secretary of the Philippines Eduardo Ermita has responded to these allegations by saying, that the U.S. soldiers &quot;... all look alike so it’s as if they never leave,&quot; going on to say that they &quot;... are replaced every now and then. They leave, contrary to the critics’ impression that they have not left&quot;. These remarks were made in response to statements made by Edgar Araojo, a political science professor at Western Mindanao State University, that the country had surrendered its sovereignty. In specific response, Ermita said, &quot;Our national sovereignty and territorial integrity are intact&quot;, going on to point out that the Balikatan exercises had bolstered national and regional security, and to say that terrorists and communist rebels were &quot;common enemies of democracy, therefore there is nothing wrong with cooperation&quot; between the armed forces of the US and the Philippines.

==Renewed mission==

Following the Battle of Marawi in 2017, United States Secretary of Defense James Mattis declared a new counter terrorism mission to assist in the combat against affiliates of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The United Kingdom and Australia also sent forces to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines. By August 2018, 250 Americans were involved in operations in the Philippines.

<text>Gomez&#x27;s Hamburger, also known as IRAS 18059-3211 or Gomez&#x27;s Whopper is an astronomical object believed to be a young A-type star surrounded by a protoplanetary disk. It was initially identified as a planetary nebula, and its distance was estimated to be approximately 6500 light-years away from Earth. However, recent results suggest that this object is a young star surrounded by a protoplanetary disk, at a distance of about 900 light-years away.

It was discovered in 1985 on sky photographs obtained by Arturo Gómez, support technical staff at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory near Vicuña, Chile. The photos suggested that there was a dark band across the object, but its exact structure was difficult to determine because of the atmospheric turbulence that hampers all images taken from the ground. The star itself has a surface temperature of approximately 10,000 K.

The &quot;buns&quot; are light reflecting off dust. A disk of dust seen nearly exactly edge-on obscures the star and produces the dark band in the middle, the &quot;burger&quot;. It has a dim visual magnitude of 14.4.

== Possible protoplanet ==
An emission at the southern part of the disk seen in carbon monoxide imaging, as well as in mid-infrared imaging, was interpreted as a protoplanet candidate, termed GoHam b. This candidate would have a mass of 0.8-11.4 . Protoplanetary disk can however form disk fragments that are gravitationally bound and can mimic protoplanets. In the case of GoHam b it is not clear if it is a protoplanet or just a disk fragment.

<text>Brintons is a British manufacturer of carpets, founded in 1783 by William Brinton, at Hill Pool in Chaddesley, Kidderminster, to manufacture spun yarns.

Its first factory in Kidderminster was established in 1820 and as of 2008 the company still had a major manufacturing presence on the Stourport edge of the town. In 1970 Brintons opened their first factory in Telford, Shropshire, to make spun yarns. It owns and operates other factories all over the world including Poland, Portugal and India manufacturing bespoke and stock woven Axminster and Wilton wool-rich carpets and rugs.

In 1993, Brintons launched an advertising campaign featuring costumes made from the company&#x27;s carpets designed by Vivienne Westwood. A second Westwood designed campaign followed in 1995, based on dress styles from 1783, the year the company was founded. The photography for both campaigns was by David Bailey. A third campaign was launched in 1996 and in 2000, British designer Antony Price created evening gowns constructed from carpet and photographed by Patrick Lichfield (Lord Lichfield) for these advertisements.

As one of the first companies to be awarded the Royal Warrant at the beginning of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s reign in 1958, Brintons has continued to supply carpets and designs for a range of projects for the Queen, Buckingham Palace and other Royal households.

The firm faced financial difficulties in 2011, its 228th year, and was acquired by The Carlyle Group in September of that year.

In August 2015, Brintons acquired Fabryka Dywanów Agnella in Białystok, a Polish manufacturer and supplier of carpets and rugs.
Brintons has one of the world&#x27;s largest commercial design archives and historical pattern libraries in the industry, which dates back to the late 18th century. It contains thousands of original hand-painted design papers from Baroque and Art Deco to up-to-the minute contemporary designs.
Brintons was acquired from Carlyle Group by Argand Partners in 2017 for an undisclosed sum.

<doc id="447228" wikidata="Q3113363" url="?curid=447228" title="List of regions of Australia">
<text>This is a list of regions of Australia that are not Australian states or territories. The most commonly known regionalisation is the governmental division of the state into regions for economic development purposes.

Others regionalisations include those made for purposes of land management, such as agriculture or conservation; information gathering, such as statistical or meteorological. Although most regionalisations were defined for specific purposes and give specific boundaries, many regions will have similar names and extents across different regionalisations. As a result, the names and boundaries of regions can vary and may overlap in popular places.

Not all the regions in this list have official status as an economic or administrative region.

==Types of Australian regionalisation==
A regionalisation of Australia is a system by which Australia is divided into regions. There are a great many different regionalisations, created for a range of purposes, including political, administrative, statistical and biological.

===Political and administrative regionalisations===

The most prominent regionalisation of Australia is the division into the various states and territories. For electoral purposes, the Australian Senate uses states and territories, but the Australian House of Representatives breaks the country into Divisions. Each state is similarly divided into electoral &quot;regions&quot;, &quot;districts&quot; or &quot;provinces&quot;, each of which elects members to the house or houses of the state&#x27;s parliament. Finally, the country is divided into local government areas, each of which is administered by a council.

Other administrative regionalisations may exist within each state. For example, the whole of mainland Western Australia other than the Perth metropolitan area, is divided into regions for the purposes of administration of the &quot;Regional Development Commissions Act 1993&quot;.

===Statistical regionalisations===
For the purposes of statistical geography, the Australian Bureau of Statistics uses the Australian Standard Geographical Classification, a hierarchical regionalisation whose coarsest level is the states and territories, then statistical divisions, statistical subdivisions, statistical local areas, and finally, census collection districts.

===Biogeographical regionalisations===
Until recently, most biogeographical and phytogeographical regionalisations of Australia were individually defined for each state and territories; for example: Gwen Harden&#x27;s botanical regionalisation of New South Wales; Orchard&#x27;s &quot;natural regions&quot; regionalisation of Tasmania; and John Stanley Beard&#x27;s division of Western Australia into Botanical Provinces and Botanical Districts.

More recently, two regionalisations that cover the entire country have been put in place. The World Wildlife Fund&#x27;s regionalisation of the world into 825 terrestrial ecoregions created 40 ecoregions in Australia. Within Australia, however, the de facto standard regionalisation is now the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA). This divides Australia into 85 bioregions, which are further divided into 404 subregions.

===Others===
There are a range of other regionalisations of Australia, including:
* meteorological and climatic regionalisations, as defined and used by the Bureau of Meteorology;
* catchment areas and drainage systems;
* geological regionalisation

* cadastral divisions of Australia

<text>The Third Battle of Krithia (Turkish: &quot;Üçüncü Kirte Muharebesi&quot;), fought on the Gallipoli peninsula during World War I, was the last in a series of Allied attacks against the Ottoman defences aimed at achieving the original objectives of 25 April 1915. The previous failures in the first and second battles resulted in a less ambitious plan being developed for the attack, but the outcome was another costly failure for the Allies. The allied aim was, as always, to facilitate the capture of &quot;Alçı Tepe&quot; (Achi Baba) which commanded most of the peninsula.

==Prelude==

By late May, the British contingent on the Cape Helles front at Gallipoli had been expanded to three division and a brigade: the 29th Division (which had made the original landing), the Royal Naval Division (now reinforced to 12 battalions), the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division and the 29th Indian Brigade. On 24 May, the commander of the 29th Division, Major General Aylmer Hunter-Weston, was promoted to lieutenant general and given command of the British VIII Corps containing all British units at Helles. Major General Beauvoir De Lisle took over command of the 29th Division.

The early battles at Helles had been fought over thinly fortified ground, but by late May two lines of trenches had begun to demarcate the battlefield. The British, in readiness for a new offensive, had been advancing their front line by stealth during the night, eventually gaining half a mile in ground while incurring only slight casualties and placing themselves within striking distance of the Ottoman front line.

The French contingent at Helles occupied the right (eastern side) of the line along the Dardanelles shore and astride the Kereves Spur. They were confronted by some of the strongest Ottoman defences, dominated by four redoubts. On 31 May, they managed to capture one of the redoubts but repeated attempts to take Haricot Redoubt failed making any advance on that front without overwhelming artillery support a hazardous proposition.

The artillery situation at Helles, as at Anzac Cove, remained perilous. The British had only 78 guns and howitzers and were still short of ammunition. When the battleship was sunk on 25 May and another battleship——sunk on 27 May, both torpedoed, the situation worsened as the naval gunfire support was reduced. Those ships that remained in support could only fire while steaming at , which did nothing to aid their accuracy.

==The plan==
Hunter-Weston&#x27;s previous battle plans lacked subtlety or sense, and he had been unerring in his failure. For the latest attempt on Krithia, some elements of refinement had begun to appear in the plans. For one, General Sir Ian Hamilton, the commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, insisted that the objectives should be limited to an advance of . This was to be made in two steps: the first step was to capture the Turkish trenches; the second was to advance a further and establish a new trench line.

The preliminary bombardment would also have two phases. The first bombardment would conclude at 11:20, at which point the British troops would feint an advance, hoping to draw the Turks to the firing line so that they would be caught in a second bombardment starting at 11:30.

The other innovation of the third battle was the use of eight armoured cars of the Royal Naval Air Service which were to advance along the main Krithia road in support of the Royal Naval Division&#x27;s advance.

The disposition of the Allied troops from left to right (west to east) was as follows:

*On the left of the line (western side) by the Aegean shore, the 29th Indian Brigade and the 1st Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers (from the 29th Division) would attack along Gully Spur and Gully Ravine.
*The 29th Division would attack beside Gully Ravine on the left side of Fir Tree Spur.
*The 42nd Division would attack on the right side of Fir Tree Spur to Kirte Dere.
*The Royal Naval Division would attack up Achi Baba Nullah (also known as Kanli Dere or &quot;Bloody Valley&quot;), supported by the armoured cars on Krithia Spur.
*The French would attack on the right along Kereves Spur.

==The battle==
The attack began at noon on 4 June, when the last bombardment ended. There was pause in bombardment to pull Ottomans back into trenches who were further decimated there by the renewal of the bombardment. Ottoman losses were around 6,000 on that first day.

On the left, the attack of the Indian Brigade was quickly halted except along the Aegean shore where the 1/6th Battalion of the Gurkha Rifles managed to advance. The 14th Battalion of King George&#x27;s Own Ferozepore Sikhs Regiment, advancing along the floor of Gully Ravine, were almost wiped out, losing 380 men out of 514 and 80% of their officers.

The 2nd Battalion of the Hampshire Regiment from the 29th Division, advancing along Fir Tree Spur alongside Gully Ravine, managed to advance but having lost contact with the Sikhs on their left were forced to defend along the bank of the ravine as well as to their front. Elsewhere, the 29th Division advance was held up with heavy casualties by Ottoman strongpoints that had survived the bombardment unscratched.

The advance of the 42nd Division was, by Gallipoli standards, very successful, quickly reaching the first objective of the Ottoman trenches and moving beyond to advance a total of . This attack was made by the 127th (Manchester) Brigade which broke through the Ottoman 9th Division&#x27;s defences and captured 217 prisoners.

The Royal Naval Division&#x27;s advance was led by the 2nd Naval Brigade which managed to reach and capture the Ottoman trenches. When the second wave—the Collingwood Battalion—attempted to continue the advance, they were caught in enfilade fire from Kereves Dere to the right where the French advance had failed. The battalion, one of the newly arrived reinforcements, was utterly annihilated and was never reformed. Further attempts to reach the second objective were successful, but the position was untenable, so within a couple of hours the RND units had retreated to their starting positions.

With the main attack decided—success for the 42nd Division in the centre, failure everywhere else—Hunter-Weston considered how to deploy his reserves. If he was to exploit the success in the centre, there was the potential to set the Ottoman flanks to flight but also the danger of creating a vulnerable salient. He decided to reinforce the flanks and renew that attack; however, the French insisted they were unable to continue the offensive so any further advances by the Royal Naval Division in Achi Baba Nullah were abandoned. Further attacks along Gully Spur and Gully Ravine failed.

At 16:00, Hunter-Weston ordered the troops to dig in and consolidate their positions; however, this coincided with the Ottoman reserves counter-attacking against the Manchester Brigade in the centre. Within one hour, the brigade was under attack from three sides so was eventually ordered to withdraw. By the end of the battle, their new front line was a mere in front of their start line, passing through a patch of vines that earned the area the name of &#x27;The Vineyard&#x27; which was to be the site of heavy fighting in August.

==Aftermath==
The objectives of the third battle of Krithia had been more realistic than the previous attempts, but it ended in failure all the same with only small gains in ground. Both sides were severely stretched following the battle. If the British had the troops to resume the attack on the following day, the Ottomans believed they would not have been able to hold.

As it was, when the Ottomans launched a counter-attack against the 29th Division at the Vineyard on 6 June, the British came close to breaking. Second Lieutenant G.R.D Moor of the 2nd Battalion, the Hampshire Regiment was awarded the Victoria Cross for stemming the retreat of his battalion. The award of Victoria Cross also involved the shooting of four men who were leading the retreat. General Henry De Lisle of the 29th Division commented that Moor shot &quot;the leading four men and the remainder came to their senses.&quot; The remainder led by Moor, according to London Gazette dated 23 July 1915, went back and recaptured a lost trench, saving &quot;a dangerous situation&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Gully Ravine (&quot;Zığındere&quot;) was a World War I battle fought at Cape Helles on the Gallipoli peninsula. By June 1915 all thoughts the Allies had of a swift decisive victory over the Ottoman Empire had vanished. The preceding Third Battle of Krithia and the attack at Gully Ravine had limited objectives and had much in common with the trench warfare prevailing on the Western Front. Unlike previous Allied attacks at Helles, the Gully Ravine action was largely successful at achieving its objectives, though at a typically high cost in casualties.

==Prelude==

The third battle of Krithia on 4 June had made some progress in the centre of the line at Helles but had failed on the left flank (west) along Gully Spur and Gully Ravine and on the right flank (east) where the French contingent were confronted by a number of strong Ottoman redoubts on Kereves Spur. As a prelude to a new offensive the commander at Helles, Lieutenant General Aylmer Hunter-Weston ordered separate limited attacks to advance the flanks.

(&quot;1. Kerevizdere Battle&quot;)On 21 June the French, with overwhelming artillery support, attacked two redoubts controlling the crest of Kereves Spur (&quot;Kervizdere&quot;). Over 40,000 shells fell on the Ottoman 2nd Division defending this area. They succeeded in capturing Haricot Redoubt but the second objective, the Quadrilateral, was not captured until 30 June. Captain Kemal Bey commanding the troops from the line of fire was wounded and died the next day. The French suffered 2,500 casualties but the Ottomans on the receiving end of the bombardment suffered 6,000. Remnants of the Ottoman 2nd Division were pulled back to the Asian side after this battle. This minor gain was cause of much celebration for allies who were at that point very anxious for any good news. General Gourard received congratulatory telegrams from London and Paris, Lord Kitchener, Admiral Robeck, and General Hamilton. Colonel Girdon was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

On 28 June a similar attack was planned for the left flank along Gully Spur, Gully Ravine and neighbouring Fir Tree Spur. The terrain around Gully Ravine () was closer to the wild and rough terrain at Anzac Cove than to the ground elsewhere at Helles. The plan was for the British 29th Division and the 29th Indian Brigade to attack along Gully Spur and the ravine while one newly arrived brigade on loan to the 29th Division, the 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade from the British 52nd (Lowland) Division, would attack along Fir Tree Spur.

==The battle==

After two days of heavy bombardment, battle began at 10.45 am on 28 June with a preliminary raid to capture the Boomerang Redoubt on Gully Spur. The general advance commenced shortly afterwards. The artillery fire on Gully Spur was overwhelming and the 2/10th Gurkha Rifles and the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers advanced rapidly a distance of half a mile to a point named &quot;Fusilier Bluff&quot; which was to become the northernmost Allied position at Helles.

In the ravine the 1st Battalion, Border Regiment did not advance as far as those troops on the spur since Ottomans there were somewhat sheltered from the deadly bombardment from the sea. Their final position was fortified with rocks and boulders and became known as &quot;Border Barricade&quot;.

On the right of the advance, along Fir Tree Spur, the battle did not go so well for the British. The inexperienced soldiers of the 156th Brigade lacked artillery support and were massacred by Ottoman machine guns and bayonet attacks. Despite the opposition, they were ordered to press the attack and so the support and reserve lines were sent forward but made no progress. By the time the attack was halted the Brigade was at half strength, having suffered casualties of which 800 had been killed. Some battalions were so depleted they had to be merged into composite formations. When the rest of the 52nd Division landed, the commander, Major General Granville Egerton, was enraged at the manner in which his 156th Brigade had been sacrificed.

==The counter-attacks==

Ottoman commanders were very concerned about this advance near the Western coast of Gallipoli which threatened to encircle their right wing. Gully Ravine became the scene of vicious and bloody fighting as the Ottomans commenced a series of counter-attacks on the night of 1–2 July. Two soldiers of the 1st Battalion, the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, Captain Gerald O&#x27;Sullivan and Corporal James Somers, were awarded the Victoria Cross for recapturing a trench taken by the Ottomans during a counter-attack.

Faik Paşa, known for his bravery and aggressiveness was put in charge of the right wing of the Otto limanne at Sıĝındere.

The Ottomans, with plentiful manpower in reserve but lacking any significant artillery and machine guns, made incessant counter-attacks culminating with the strongest on 5 July but all were repulsed. Still, the control of the strategic hills overlooking Sıgındere and Kerevizdere were denied to the Allies by massive Ottoman bayonet attacks. The Ottoman casualties for the period between 28 June and 5 July are estimated at between 14,000 and 16,000, four times the British losses. Where possible the Ottoman dead were burned but a truce to bury them was refused. The British believed the dead bodies were an effective barrier and that Ottoman soldiers were unwilling to attack across them. This was one of the few truly unvalorous and unmagnanimous acts committed by Allies which infuriated the Ottoman greatly.

In the face of immense losses, Faik Paşa had stopped first the counterattack on the morning of 30 June. In spite of strong and direct urging from Liman Paşa (Otto Liman von Sanders) and pressure to continue the counter-attack, he wanted to rest his badly decimated troops for a day. Hesitation of Faik Paşa unnerved Weber Paşa who was in command of the front there. He contemplated pulling back behind the ever strategic Alçı Tepe as a last resort. This would have given over complete victory to the Allies. He had to be strongly dissuaded by Liman Paşa.

Finally, the Ottoman 1st Division led by Lieutenant Colonel (&quot;Kaymakam&quot;) Cafer Tayyar Bey commenced another counterattack at 18:00 on 2 July. Again, though they reached within 30m of the British trenches, the losses were unbearable. Men were melting away in front of rows of machine guns. Attack continued whole night. Eventually Faik Paşa ordered them to dig in and take defensive posture. Liman Paşa immediately released him and assigned Mehmet Ali Paşa in his place. As soon as the 3. Division which had just crossed the Narrows and arrived at the lines around midnight, Mehmet Ali Paşa ordered them to attack 3:45 am. Liman Paşa agreed to delay the attack for 24 hours only after a Major Eggert on the staff of Mehmet Ali Paşa personally appealed to him.

Meanwhile, the Allies had observed the preparation for the attack from the air and made their own preparations. On 5 July the last major attack of this battle commenced but met with a very strong wall of fire the Allies put up. The dead were mounting again in front of the British trenches. Mehmet Ali Paşa staff were of the opinion that the Allied advance was already halted and there was no need for these heavy losses. Mehmet Ali Paşa, in fear of a reaction from Liman Paşa, who was in turn intimidated by Enver Paşa hesitated. Again, Major Eggert intervened and Liman Paşa yielded. Finally the slaughter was stopped. This was the bloodiest episode in the entire campaign.

After the counter-attacks ceased, the front line stabilised and remained largely static for the rest of the Gallipoli campaign although both sides engaged in a vigorous mining war around the ravine.

==Achi Baba Nullah (&quot;2. Kerevizdere Battle&quot;)==
Hunter-Weston had one final fling at Helles. Once the two remaining brigades of the 52nd Division had landed (the 155th and 157th Brigades) he planned a new attack for 12 July in the centre of the line east of the Krithia Road and along Achi Baba Nullah (also known as Kanlı Dere and &quot;Bloody Valley&quot;) where the Royal Naval Division had spent most of its time at Helles and suffered so badly during the third battle of Krithia. It was expected that due to heavy Ottoman losses in the previous battle, morale would be low.

The plan was for one brigade to attack in the morning and the other to attack in the afternoon so that the full weight of artillery support could be lent to each brigade. The 155th Brigade would attack at 7.35 am and the 157th at 4.50 pm. Bombardment began at 4:30 am, from land, sea and air. 14 Allied planes participated in softening up the Ottoman defenses, one of the first such combined actions in military history.

Both attacks began well with the capture of the first Ottoman trench but descended into chaos and confusion as, in a repeat of the April and May Helles battles, the troops advanced too far, lost contact and came under artillery and machine gun fire. The next morning confusion and panic resulted in a disorderly retreat which was eventually halted but Hunter-Weston ordered the advance to resume and sent the battered Royal Naval Division in again. The line was stabilised.

By the end of the battle, one third of the 52nd Division had become casualties. General Egerton was temporarily dismissed from his command of the division for protesting at the treatment of his troops.

==Aftermath==
In late June General Hunter-Weston departed his command of the British VIII Corps, suffering some indeterminate ailment. This marked the end of Helles as the main front at Gallipoli. The British attempted no more major offensives there for the remainder of the campaign. Weber Paşa, having lost Liman Paşa&#x27;s confidence was sent back to Germany. The fighting now concentrated along the Sari Bair range and at a new landing at Suvla. In support of this new offensive in August, a diversionary attack was made at Helles which resulted in heavy fighting around Krithia Vineyard. Helles was finally evacuated on 8 January 1916.

<doc id="447249" wikidata="Q6253138" url="?curid=447249" title="John Ponsonby, 4th Earl of Bessborough">
<text>John William Ponsonby, 4th Earl of Bessborough, PC (31 August 1781 – 16 May 1847), known as Viscount Duncannon from 1793 to 1844, was a British Whig politician. He was notably Home Secretary in 1834 and served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland between 1846 and 1847, the first years of the Great Famine.

==Background and education==
A member of the prominent Ponsonby family of Cumberland, he was the eldest son of Frederick Ponsonby, 3rd Earl of Bessborough, and Lady Henrietta Frances Spencer, daughter of John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer. Sir Frederick Ponsonby and William Ponsonby, 1st Baron de Mauley, were his younger brothers, while Lady Caroline Lamb was his younger sister. Ponsonby&#x27;s mother was Lord Granville&#x27;s lover prior to his marriage to Lady Harriet Cavendish, the Countess of Bessborough&#x27;s niece. Lord Granville fathered two illegitimate children through her: Harriette Stewart and George Stewart. Lord Bessborough was educated at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford.

==Political career==
He was First Commissioner of Woods and Forests under Lord Grey (1831–1834) and served under Lord Melbourne in that office (1835–1841), briefly as Home Secretary (1834), and as Lord Privy Seal (1835–1839). Later, he served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland under Lord John Russell from 1846 until his death on 16 May 1847. During his service the Great Famine (Ireland) progressed. He was made a Privy Counsellor in 1831 and in 1834, ten years before he succeeded his father, he was created Baron Duncannon, of Bessborough in the County of Kilkenny. He was Lord Lieutenant of Kilkenny from November 1838 until his death.

He had a stammer, which made him a very reluctant public speaker, believing that it hampered his political career. As Lord Duncannon, he was unkindly nicknamed &quot;Dumbcannon&quot;. In private on the other hand, he was regarded as a valued colleague in Government, due largely to his ability to keep his head in a crisis. He was one of the so-called Committee of Four who drafted the Reform Act 1832.

==Marriage and issue==

John Ponsonby married Lady Maria Fane, daughter of John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland, and his wife Sarah (née Child), on 16 November 1805 at Berkeley Square, London. They had eight sons and six daughters. 

Their daughter Lady Emily Charlotte Mary remained unmarried but she wrote a number of novels which were published without attribution. Through his daughter Lady Augusta Gore, Bessborough was the grandfather of sportsman Spencer Gore, who won the first Wimbledon singles title in 1877; and the Rt. Rev. Charles Gore, the Bishop of Oxford; and barrister Sir Francis Charles Gore.

Children of Lord and Lady Bessborough:

* Lady Georgiana Sarah Ponsonby (15 August 1807 – 25 June 1861), married Rev. Sackville Bourke, nephew of the Earl of Mayo
* John George Brabazon Ponsonby, 5th Earl of Bessborough (14 October 1809 – 28 January 1880)
* William Wentworth Brabazon Ponsonby (29 December 1812 – 8 July 1831)
* Lady Augusta Lavinia Priscilla Ponsonby (11 May 1814 – 19 November 1904), married firstly William Petty-FitzMaurice, Earl of Kerry, 1834; secondly, the Hon. Charles Alexander Gore, 1845
* Frederick George Brabazon Ponsonby, 6th Earl of Bessborough (11 September 1815 – 11 March 1895)
* Lady Emily Charlotte Mary Ponsonby (17 February 1817 – 3 February 1877)
* Lady Maria Jane Elizabeth Ponsonby (14 March 1819 – 13 September 1897), married her cousin Hon. Charles Ponsonby, 2nd Baron de Mauley

* Rt. Hon. Sir Spencer Cecil Ponsonby-Fane (14 March 1824 – 1 December 1915)
* Lady Harriet Frederica Anne Ponsonby (17 June 1825 – 16 November 1900)
* Lady Kathleen Louisa Georgina Ponsonby (30 August 1826 – 9 July 1863), married Frederick Edward Bunbury Tighe
* Son, died in infancy (28 May 1828 – 5 July 1828)
* Hon. Gerald Henry Brabazon Ponsonby (17 July 1829 – 30 November 1908), married Maria Emma Catherine Coventry

The Viscountess Duncannon died in March 1834, aged 46. Lord Bessborough survived her by thirteen years and died in May 1847, aged 65. He was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son, John, and subsequently by his younger sons Frederick and Walter. Bessborough Gardens in London is named after Lord Bessborough.

<doc id="447251" wikidata="Q1277363" url="?curid=447251" title="Earl of March">
<text>Earl of March is a title that has been created several times, respectively, in the Peerage of Scotland and the Peerage of England. The title derives from the &quot;marches&quot; or borderlands between England and either Wales (Welsh Marches) or Scotland (Scottish Marches), and it was held by several great feudal families which owned lands in those districts. Later, however, the title came to be granted as an honorary dignity, and ceased to carry any associated power in the marches.

The Scottish earldom is extant in its own right, and it is held by James Charteris, 13th Earl of Wemyss and 9th Earl of March. 

The English earldom is today the main non-ducal subsidiary title of the Duke of Richmond. The current duke&#x27;s eldest son, named Charles like his father, enjoys it as a courtesy title.

==Earls of March in the Peerage of Scotland==
The Earls of March on the Scottish border were descended from Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria, but being soon afterwards deprived of this position he fled to Scotland, where Máel Coluim III, King of Scotland, welcomed him and granted him Dunbar and the adjoining lands. His successors controlled the Marches, but Earl of March was only assumed as an alternative title to that of Earl of Dunbar by Patrick de Dunbar, 8th Earl of March. The last of his successors was George de Dunbar, 11th Earl of March and Dunbar, whose honours and lands were forfeited to the Crown. He retired to England and died in obscurity.

Following his forfeiture, the next creation of the Earldom of March was for Alexander Stuart, Duke of Albany. At the death of his successor John, the dukedom and earldom became extinct. The next creation was for Robert Stuart, but at his death, the earldom again became extinct.

The most recent Scottish creation of the Earldom of March was in 1697 for Lord William Douglas, second son of the William Douglas, 1st Duke of Queensberry. He was also created Lord Douglas of Neidpath, Lyne and Munard, and Viscount of Peebles, with remainder to heirs male of his body, failing which to his other heirs male and of tailzie. He was succeeded by his son, also William, who married Anne Douglas-Hamilton, 2nd Countess of Ruglen. They were both succeeded by their son, another William, who became 3rd Earl of March and 3rd Earl of Ruglen.

In 1768 the third earl was created Baron Douglas of Amesbury, and in 1778 he succeeded his first cousin twice removed, Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry, as fourth Duke of Queensberry. The duke died childless in 1810, however, and his titles were inherited by several different individuals. The earldom of Ruglen and barony of Douglas of Amesbury became extinct. The dukedom of Queensberry was inherited by his second cousin once removed, Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch (see the Duke of Buccleuch for later history of this title). The marquessate and earldom of Queensberry passed to his kinsman Sir Charles Douglas, 5th Baronet (see the Marquess of Queensberry for later history of these titles). The earldom of March and its two subsidiary titles were inherited by his second cousin once removed Francis Wemyss-Charteris, later the eighth Earl of Wemyss.

===Scottish Earls of March, first Creation===

===Scottish Earls of March, second Creation (1455)===
*Alexander Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany (c. 1455–1485)
*John Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany (1481–1536)

With subsidiary title &quot;Lord (of) Dunbar&quot; (1581)
*Robert Stuart, 1st Earl of March (died 1586)

* William Douglas, 2nd Earl of March (d. 1731)
* William Douglas, 4th Duke of Queensberry and 3rd Earl of March (1724–1810)
* Francis Douglas, 8th Earl of Wemyss and 4th Earl of March (1772–1853)

See Earl of Wemyss and March for later holders of the title.

==Earls of March in the Peerage of England==
The Earls of March on the Welsh Marches were descended from Roger Mortimer, as there had been no single office in this region since the Earl of Mercia. He forfeited his title, which was in the Peerage of England, for treason in 1330, but his grandson Roger managed to have it restored eighteen years later. With the death of the fifth Earl, however, there remained no more Mortimers who were heirs to the first Earl, and the title passed to the fifth earl&#x27;s nephew, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York. Duke Richard passed the title on to his son Edward, who would later become King Edward IV, causing the earldom of March to merge into the Crown.

In the Peerage of England, the next creation of the earldom came when Edward Plantagenet, Duke of Cornwall was made Earl of March in 1479. In 1483, he succeeded as King Edward V, and the earldom merged in the crown. Later that year, however, his uncle Richard of Gloucester acceded to the throne as Richard III. The fate of the young Edward and his brother, Richard has never been confirmed.

The next English creation was in favour of Esme Stewart, the third Duke of Lennox. His successors bore the earldom, until the death of the sixth Duke, when both the earldom and the dukedom became extinct. The last English creation was in favour of Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond and Lennox. His successors have borne the English earldom of March since then.

<doc id="447254" wikidata="Q905137" url="?curid=447254" title="Didymus the Musician">
<text>Didymus the Musician (Greek: ) was a music theorist in Rome of the end of the 1st century BC or beginning of the 1st century AD, who combined elements of earlier theoretical approaches with an appreciation of the aspect of performance. Formerly assumed to be identical with the Alexandrian grammarian and lexicographer Didymus Chalcenterus, because Ptolemy and Porphyry referred to him as Didymus &quot;ho mousikos&quot; (the musician), classical scholars now believe that this Didymus was a younger grammarian and musician working in Rome at the time of Emperor Nero. He was a predecessor of Ptolemy at the library of Alexandria. According to Andrew Barker, his intention was to revive and produce contemporary performances of the music of Greek antiquity. The syntonic comma of is sometimes called the &quot;comma of Didymus&quot; after him.

Among his works was &quot;On the Difference between the Aristoxenians and the Pythagoreans&quot; ( ).

== Theory ==
We know of his theory only indirectly from the works of Porphyry and Ptolemy. There, one finds examples of his tetrachords as measured string lengths from which the following frequency ratios are calculated:

Like Archytas, he used a major third, but appears to have been the first to use it in the diatonic as the product of the major (9:8) and minor (10:9) whole tones, as the proportions produced by The ratio of these whole tones is the so-called &quot;syntonic comma&quot;, also referred to as &quot;Didymos&#x27; comma&quot;.

<doc id="447255" wikidata="Q544910" url="?curid=447255" title="The Icicle Thief">
<text>The Icicle Thief (, ) is a 1989 Italian comedy film directed by Maurizio Nichetti, titled in imitation of Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s 1948 classic Italian neorealist film &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot; (Italian: &quot;Ladri di biciclette&quot;). Some feel &quot;The Icicle Thief&quot; was created as a spoof of neorealism, which predominated Italian cinema after World War II. However, it is generally understood that the film is critical of the impact of consumerism on art, as suggested by the contrast between the nested film and commercials, and the apathy of Italian television viewers in recognising the difference between the two. The film won the Golden St. George at the 16th Moscow International Film Festival.

==Plot==
The movie begins with a film director, played by director Maurizo Nichetti himself, discussing his latest film on an intellectual Italian TV channel which is about to broadcast it at short notice in place of a more highly regarded competitor’s. His &quot;masterpiece&quot; follows the bleak travails of a poverty-stricken unemployed man (again played by Nichetti) who finds work in a chandelier factory, but cannot resist stealing one of the gleaming lights for his wife. The pompous director is initially pleased with the seriousness with which his work is analysed, but he then becomes distraught when his black-and-white opus is repeatedly interrupted by full-colour commercials. The TV audience, watching in their homes, are completely oblivious of the interruptions and the &quot;outrages&quot; perpetrated on the director’s artistic intentions.

=== Nested film plot ===

The nested film borrows key elements from the &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot;, with the protagonist family having the same first names from the original, and the director intending to end the film tragically. The director’s original plot followed the travails of Antonio Piermattei (Maurizo Nichetti) and his impoverished family: Antonio finds work in a chandelier factory, where he tries to steal one of the lights for his wife, Maria (Caterina Sylos Labini).

When Antonio manages to smuggle a chandelier out of the factory, he is supposed to be paralysed by a traffic accident with a truck while riding home with the chandelier (just after the plot diverges due to a power failure). The accident would have forced Maria into prostitution, with their two sons, Bruno (Federico Rizzo) and Paolo (Matteo Auguardi), ending up in an orphanage in the final scene.

=== Plot divergence ===

A power failure in the studio causes a model (Heidi Komarek) from one of the commercials to end up in the nested film&#x27;s universe and disrupt the plot. Maria, thinking that Antonio is having an affair with the model, enters the commercial universe by faking her death, causing the police in the film to accuse Antonio of murdering her.

Nichetti is forced to enter the film universe to restore the original plot, but Bruno convinces Don Italo (Renato Scarpa) to shift the blame from Antonio to Nichetti for Maria&#x27;s murder, after learning of Nichetti’s orphanage plot: this causes Nichetti to chase Bruno through the commercial universe before ending up in the commercial for floor wax, where Maria had been realising her aspiration as a singer.

=== Actual ending ===

Back in the film universe, Antonio laments the apparent loss of Maria and Bruno, and the possibility of the model leaving him due to the grim nature of the film. However, Nichetti manages to convince Maria and Bruno to return to the film universe with shopping carts of modern-day goods, with the Piermattei family reunited the satisfaction of the viewer (Carlina Torta). Nichetti then attempts to return to the real world, only to be trapped in the film universe after the viewer switches off the television set before going to bed.

== Cast ==
* Maurizio Nichetti as himself, and Antonio Piermattei
* Caterina Sylos Labini as Maria Piermattei, Antonio’s wife
* Federico Rizzo as Bruno Piermattei, Antonio’s son
* Matteo Auguardi as Paolo Piermattei, Antonio’s baby son
* Renato Scarpa as Don Italo
* Heidi Komarek as the model
* Claudio G. Fava as the Film Critic
* Massimo Sacilotto and Carlina Torta as television viewers

== Wordplay translation ==

The film&#x27;s Italian title &quot;Ladri di saponette&quot;, a play on the Italian title of De Sica&#x27;s film, means &quot;Soap Thieves&quot;; it is justified by dialogue where a boy is told not to use up all the soap when washing his hands, and his mother wonders if he is eating it. For English-speaking audiences, the title was changed to &quot;The Icicle Thief&quot;, playing on the English title of De Sica&#x27;s film. This title was justified by changing the wording of the English subtitles when the characters talk about some chandeliers and one is stolen. In the original Italian dialogue they are said to sparkle like pearls (&quot;pèrle&quot;) and drops of water (&quot;gocce&quot;), but in the English subtitles, they look &quot;like icicles&quot; (which in Italian would be &quot;ghiaccioli&quot;).

==Critical reception==
Reviewing the film for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Sheila Benson wrote, &quot;Bless the Italians and their obsession with movies. Having created a permanent niche in the hearts of the world&#x27;s movie sentimentalists with &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot;, they now let loose their secret weapon, writer-director-actor and comic extraordinaire, Maurizio Nichetti&quot;. She found &quot;The Icicle Thief&quot; to be an &quot;ingenious comedy&quot;, adding, &quot;Pirandello rarely did it better and in &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; Woody Allen didn&#x27;t get this nuttily complex&quot;, before concluding that the film is &quot;a lot like its creator--slight, ingenious and sneakily irresistible&quot;.

In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe was less impressed, beginning by noting, &quot;The TV thing, right? It slices our sense of reality into 15-minute chunks. Its commercials ruin the dramatic integrity of the programs they interrupt. It turns us into dumb couch potatoes. It gives us limited attention spans. I said it gives us limited attention spans. These and other TV-loathing observations, as most of us have asserted in everything from organized junior-high class discussions to alcohol-induced dorm-room rantings, are inarguably true. But in &quot;The Icicle Thief&quot;, a satirical fantasy about the way television butchers the movies it puts on, Italian film director Maurizio Nichetti &#x27;discovers&#x27; these insights as though for the first time&quot;. Howe goes on, &quot;The parts of &quot;Icicle&quot; […] that bash the boob tube comprise the film&#x27;s least enlightening elements; they&#x27;re facile, almost sophomoric. […] But the parts which reveal, without self-conscious underlinings, the trashy TV culture in which we live, as well as the TV commercial switcheroos, are where it&#x27;s worth watching&quot;. Overall, however, Howe concluded that: &quot;things become a little too convoluted and &quot;Icicle&quot; joins that crowded group of Italian movies with an apparent inability to understand the concept of excess. But, as with many such films, the inner spirit frequently carries you over, and although Nichetti tells us practically nothing new about the global village, he certainly has fun with the possibilities&quot;.

<doc id="447258" wikidata="Q2095351" url="?curid=447258" title="Lawrence Watt-Evans">
<text>Lawrence Watt-Evans (born 1954) is one of the pseudonyms of American science fiction and fantasy author Lawrence Watt Evans (another pseudonym, used primarily for science fiction, is Nathan Archer).

==Biography==

Born in Arlington, Massachusetts, as the fourth of six children, he made his first attempts at professional writing when he was eight.

After graduating from Bedford High School in Bedford, Massachusetts, he attended Princeton University but left without a degree. By the rules of Princeton, he could not reapply for a year, during which he began to seriously try to sell his writing, but he sold nothing significant until &quot;The Lure of the Basilisk&quot; in 1979 (published 1980); he began then writing full-time. Despite having sold a short story and several articles under his real name, he initially submitted his first novel under a pseudonym. It was the editor of that novel, Lester del Rey, who first demanded for him to use his real name, and del Rey added the hyphen to create the name Lawrence Watt-Evans. Evans had insisted on including his middle name to avoid confusion with a contemporary nonfiction writer, also named Lawrence Evans, and del Rey had then added the hyphen &quot;to make it more distinctive&quot;.

Watt-Evans was president of the Horror Writers Association from 1994 to 1996, and has also served as Eastern Regional Director and treasurer of Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. From 1995 to 1997, he was half of a partnership known as Malicious Press (with screenwriter Terry Rossio), which published &quot;Deathrealm&quot; magazine, edited by Stephen Mark Rainey and he was the managing editor of the webzine &quot;Helix SF&quot; for its entire run of ten quarterly issues.

In April 2005, Watt-Evans announced that the first draft of his latest Ethshar novel, &quot;The Spriggan Mirror&quot;, would be made available online as a serial, using a modified version of the Street Performer Protocol. The draft has since been finished and was previously available in its entirety on one of Watt-Evans&#x27; websites. However, a revised version has now been published commercially in both electronic and paper editions, so the free version has been removed. He since completed several online serials, all using that same method: &quot;The Vondish Ambassador&quot; in 2007, &quot;Realms of Light&quot; started November 2008 (his only non-Ethshar serial, a sequel to &quot;Nightside City&quot;), &quot;The Final Calling&quot; started in June 2010 (later published as &quot;The Unwelcome Warlock&quot;). In April–July 2012 he did a 5th serial, &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Widow&quot;.

In June 2013 Watt-Evans began a crowd-funding campaign for his unpublished science fiction novel &quot;Vika&#x27;s Avenger&quot;, a story unrelated to his previous works, and in July he started a sixth Ethshar serial, &quot;Ishta&#x27;s Companion&quot;. In 2014 he announced that, as the response to the campaign for &quot;Ishta&#x27;s Companion&quot; had been disappointing, he would stop writing online serials. The book was published as &quot;Relics of War&quot;.

<doc id="447259" wikidata="Q3017694" url="?curid=447259" title="David Collenette">
<text>David Michael Collenette, PC OOnt (born 24 June 1946) is a former Canadian politician. From 1974, until his retirement from politics in 2004, he was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. A graduate from York University&#x27;s Glendon College in 1969, he subsequently received his MA, in 2004 and LL.D for education in 2015 from the same university. He was first elected in the York East riding of Toronto to the House of Commons on 8 July 1974, in the Pierre Trudeau government and returned to Parliament in 1993 representing Don Valley East.

Collenette served as a Member of the Canadian House of Commons for more than 20 years. He was elected five times and defeated twice. He served in the Cabinet under three prime ministers - Pierre Trudeau, John Turner, and Jean Chrétien. He held several portfolios:
* Minister of State-Multiculturalism (1983–1984);
* Minister of National Defence (1993–1996);
* Minister of Veterans Affairs (1993–1996);
* Minister of Transport (1997–2003) and
* Minister of Crown Corporations (2002–2003).
During the constitutional debates of the early 1980s, he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Government House leader and was assigned by the government to Westminster to represent Canada&#x27;s interests.

He served as Chair of the House of Commons Special Energy Committee in 1982–83 dealing with legislation for the national energy program (NEP).

== Politics ==
Collenette was one of only three cabinet members to endorse Jean Chrétien in the 1984 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, along with Charles Caccia and Roméo LeBlanc.

He also supported Chrétien in the 1990 leadership campaign.

===Minister of National Defence===
As Minister of Defence, Collenette oversaw the reorganization, restructuring and re-engineering of the department as part of the federal government&#x27;s deficit cutting. During this time the Canadian Forces were involved in challenging assignments in the Balkans, Haiti and Somalia.

During his tenure, Collenette was at the centre of the controversy over the establishment of a public inquiry into the Somalia Affair investigating war crimes committed by Canadian Soldiers during deployment in 1992 by the Mulroney Progressive Conservatives. The Chrétien government later decided to curtail the inquiry.

In October 1996, Collenette resigned from cabinet citing a letter that he had written on behalf of a constituent. An access to information request revealed Collenette broke ethical guidelines by writing the letter to the Immigration and Refugee Board. Collenette cited this violation as his official reason for resigning from cabinet but his resignation also served to remove him from the ongoing Somalia Affair controversy.

===Minister of Transport===
After a few months on the back benches, he was re-admitted to Cabinet in July 1997 and was appointed Minister of Transport. In this portfolio his most important decisions were those that led to the merging of Canadian Airlines and Air Canada, the divestment of CN Rail operations in Northern Manitoba to the favour of Omnitrax, and the pseudo-commercialisation of Port Authorities under the Canada Marine Act. He also successfully argued in the late 1990s for the first substantial increase in funding for Via Rail since cuts in 1981, 1990 and 1994.

On 11 September 2001, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) closed down U.S. airspace after a series of terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Collenette acted swiftly and shut down Canadian airspace in order to take in diverted U.S.-bound international flights, launching Transport Canada&#x27;s Operation Yellow Ribbon. Ultimately, 255 flights carrying 44,519 passengers were diverted to 15 Canadian airports. In the time that has followed, Collenette has applauded the way Canadians responded to the crisis. He, Chrétien, U.S. Ambassador to Canada Paul Cellucci, and other provincial and local officials presided over Canada&#x27;s memorial service to mark the first anniversary of 9/11 at Gander International Airport in Newfoundland and Labrador. There, he helped Chrétien unveil a plaque, commemorating the acts of kindness seen for the diverted passengers not just in Gander, but across the country.

=== Regional Minister Responsible for the Greater Toronto Area ===
As regional Minister for the Greater Toronto Area 1997–2003, Mr. Collenette oversaw federal infrastructure funding that resulted in the largest single expansion of cultural institutions in Canadian history at the Royal Ontario Museum, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, the National Ballet School, the Royal Conservatory of Music, the Roy Thompson Hall and the Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art. He also initiated the second tranche of GTA infrastructure funding for $1 billion towards major GO Transit improvements, including the reopening of CN Bradford to Barrie line. Mr. Collenette promoted the concept of a rail link between Pearson Airport and downtown Toronto and under his leadership, planning, acquisition of property and a Solicitation of Interest the project was implemented. The highly successful link was subsequently built by Metrolinx and opened in 2016.

Collenette also designated the Oak Ridges Moraine portion of the Pickering Airport lands administered by Transport Canada, as open greenspace in perpetuity. These lands eventually became part of the Rouge National Urban Park, opened in 2015.

=== Retirement ===
Chrétien was pressured into resigning as prime minister and party leader by supporters of former finance minister Paul Martin. As Collenette was considered a staunch Chrétien loyalist it was not surprising that he was dropped from cabinet when Martin became prime minister in December 2003. Collenette initially planned to stay on as a backbench MP, however he was then informed that his riding nomination would not be guaranteed. On 29 January 2004, Collenette announced his retirement from politics and went on to work in academia and as a consultant in the private sector.

==Post-political career==
He is a member of the board of directors of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (North America) and of Harbourfront Corporation in Toronto. He also is a past member of the board at Toronto East General Hospital Foundation Campaign Executive Team and of the Glendon School of Public and International Affairs. Collenette was a Senior Counsel with Hill &amp; Knowlton Canada, a public relations and communications firm until recently. He currently serves as Chair of the NATO Association of Canada.

David Collenette served as the Government of Ontario Special Advisor for High-Speed Rail in the Windsor - Toronto corridor, from 2015 to 2018.

=== City of Ottawa Transportation Task Force Committee ===
On 19 January 2007, Ottawa Mayor Larry O&#x27;Brien named Collenette as the head of a volunteer Transportation Task Force Committee in which in a six-month period it reviewed the transportation issues across the city. It produced a report which suggested light-rail service expansion throughout the city of Ottawa, including an east–west route in a downtown tunnel, and several communities in Eastern Ontario as well as portions of the Outaouais region in Western Quebec. The Ottawa LRT opened in 2019. His report also suggested one to two new interprovincial bridge crossings between Gatineau and Ottawa over the next 30 years.

== Personal life ==
He is married to Penny Collenette. She was selected to be the Liberal candidate in the riding of Ottawa Centre for the 40th Canadian federal election but lost to incumbent NDP MP Paul Dewar. David has one son Christopher Collenette a Dublin-based company executive and corporate director.

In January 2024, he was appointed to the Order of Ontario.

<text>U.S. Route 2 or U.S. Highway 2 (US 2) is an east–west United States Numbered Highway spanning across the northern continental United States. US 2 consists of two segments connected by various roadways in southern Canada. Unlike some routes, which are disconnected into segments because of encroaching Interstate Highways, the two portions of US 2 were designed to be separate in the original 1926 highway plan.

The western segment of US 2 begins at an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5) and State Route 529 (Maple Street) in Everett, Washington, and ends at I-75 in St. Ignace, Michigan. The eastern segment of US 2 begins at US 11 in Rouses Point, New York, and ends at I-95 in Houlton, Maine.

As its number indicates, it is the northernmost east–west U.S. Highway in the country. It is the lowest primary-numbered east–west U.S. Highway, whose numbers otherwise end in zero, and was so numbered to avoid a US 0. Sections of US 2 in New England were once New England Route 15, part of the New England road marking system.

The western segment of US 2 extends west from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan across the northern tier of the lower 48 states. Most of the western route was built roughly paralleling the Great Northern Railway. US 2 adopted the railway&#x27;s route nickname &quot;The Highline&quot; as the most northern crossing in the U.S.

The Adventure Cycling Association&#x27;s Northern Tier Bicycle Route is a bicycle touring route which follows or parallels US 2 for over , most notably a stretch between Columbia Falls, Montana, and Williston, North Dakota.

====Washington====

Within Washington, US 2 is the northernmost all-season highway through the Cascade Mountains. It begins at I-5 and SR 529 in Everett and travels east via Stevens Pass. It intersects US 97 approximately east of Leavenworth and continues as a duplicate route crossing the Columbia River at Wenatchee, then continues north as far as Orondo, where US 97 splits north. US 2 continues to Spokane and the border in Newport.

====Idaho====
Shortly after entering Idaho from the west, US 2 crosses the Priest River. US 2 follows Pend Oreille River to its source at Lake Pend Oreille. US 2 intersects State Highway 57 in the town of Priest River at mile 5.8. US 2 intersects US 95 at mile 28.4 in the town of Sandpoint. The two routes overlap for until just after Bonners Ferry. At Three Mile Corner, US 2 continues southeast for where it crosses into Montana.

====Montana====

US 2 is a vital northern corridor for Montana and has more mileage within Montana than in any other state. It intersects US 93 at Kalispell and passes through the southern end of Glacier National Park, crossing the Continental Divide at Marias Pass, before it enters the Great Plains west of Browning. It travels through Shelby where it meets I-15, before it goes on to Havre, where it meets the northern terminus of US 87, intersecting with US 191 in Malta, and then onward to Glasgow. The highway continues east and leaves the state near the confluence of the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers.

====North Dakota====

US 2 is an east–west highway that runs through North Dakota&#x27;s northern tier of larger cities: Williston, Minot, Devils Lake, and Grand Forks. US 2 intersects US 85 at Williston, US 52 and US 83 at Minot, US 281 at Churchs Ferry (west of Devils Lake), and the I-29/US 81 concurrency at Grand Forks. US 2 is four lanes from North Dakota&#x27;s eastern edge to just past Williston, a stretch of about , leaving the remaining to the Montana border as a two-lane highway.

In Rugby, just east of the route&#x27;s intersection with North Dakota Highway 3, the highway passes the location designated in 1931 as the geographical center of North America. The monument marking the geographic center had to be relocated in 1971 when US 2 was converted from two to four lanes.

====Minnesota====

The portion of US 2 from Cass Lake to Bemidji is officially designated the Paul Bunyan Expressway. It also intersects US 169 and the Mississippi River in Grand Rapids. At the crossing between Duluth and Superior, Wisconsin, the highway crosses the Richard I. Bong Memorial Bridge, about in length—roughly in length when the above land approaches are included.

Of the of US 2 in Minnesota, have four lanes, mostly located in the northwest part of the state.

Legally, the Minnesota section of US 2 is defined as Routes 8 and 203 in Minnesota Statutes §§ and .

====Wisconsin====
After crossing the Bong Bridge and entering into the city of Superior, Wisconsin&#x27;s western segment of the highway joins Belknap Street. After crossing the midsection of Superior, US 2 merges with US 53 for a few miles following East 2nd Street out of the city. US 53 and US 2 part ways outside of Superior. US 53 veers south toward Eau Claire, while US 2 continues to the city of Ashland and ultimately to the Wisconsin–Michigan state line at the city of Ironwood. An eastern segment of US 2 re-enters Wisconsin northwest of Florence and proceeds concurrently with US 141 for until exiting Wisconsin again near Iron Mountain, Michigan.

====Michigan====
US 2 enters Michigan at the city of Ironwood and runs east to the town of Crystal Falls, where it turns south and re-enters Wisconsin northwest of Florence. It re-enters Michigan north of Iron Mountain and continues through the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to the cities of Escanaba, Manistique, and St. Ignace. Along the way, it cuts through the Ottawa and Hiawatha National Forests and follows the northern shore of Lake Michigan. It ends at I-75, just north of the Mackinac Bridge in St. Ignace.

===Eastern segment===

The eastern segment of US 2 traverses the northeastern part of New York and the northern New England states.

====New York====
The road starts at US 11, just south of the Canadian border at Rouses Point in Champlain. From there, it crosses the Richelieu River at the outlet of Lake Champlain on the Rouses Point Bridge into Grand Isle County, Vermont. The road is less than long in the state.

====Vermont====

US 2 traverses the length of Grand Isle County and crosses Lake Champlain over several bridges until it reaches the mainland in Milton and Chittenden County. From there, it travels south to Burlington, where it begins to closely parallel I-89 all the way to Montpelier, in Washington County. At Montpelier, the road turns northeastward, crossing into Caledonia County and passing through St. Johnsbury. It then passes into Essex County and eventually crosses the Connecticut River from Guildhall into Lancaster, New Hampshire.

====New Hampshire====
Once into New Hampshire, the road continues southeastward, passing through Jefferson (home to several small amusement parks and roadside attractions, such as Santa&#x27;s Village) before heading more easterly, skirting the northern edge of the White Mountain National Forest into Gorham, where it meets Route 16, the major north–south roadway through the eastern half of the forest and past Mount Washington. From Gorham, the road travels east along the southern banks of the Androscoggin River to Shelburne and eventually crosses into Gilead, Maine. Throughout its entire stretch, the New Hampshire portion of US 2 is in Coös County.

====Maine====

US 2 travels from Gilead to Houlton near Houlton International Airport. US 2 ends at I-95 just west of the Canadian border.

==History==

A large portion of the western segment of US 2, and a shorter piece of the eastern segment, follows the old Theodore Roosevelt International Highway. This auto trail, named in honor of the late former president and naturalist Theodore Roosevelt, was organized in February 1919 to connect Portland, Maine, with Portland, Oregon. The route taken by this highway left Portland, Maine, to the northwest, crossing New England via Littleton, New Hampshire, and Montpelier, Vermont, to Burlington, Vermont. It crossed Lake Champlain on the Burlington–Port Kent Ferry and headed west across Upstate New York, through Watertown and Rochester to Buffalo. After crossing Southern Ontario, the highway re-entered the U.S. in Detroit, Michigan, running northwest and north via Saginaw and Alpena to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where it turned west along the northern tier of the country. This portion took the route past Duluth, Minnesota; Minot, North Dakota; Havre, Montana; and Glacier National Park to Spokane, Washington. In order to reach Portland, Oregon, the highway turned south in Washington via Walla Walla to Pendleton, Oregon, where it headed west again via the Columbia River Highway to Portland. The last piece of the highway to be completed was over Marias Pass through Glacier National Park; cars were carried through the park on the Great Northern Railway until 1930.

The first interstate numbering for the Roosevelt Highway was in New England, where the New England road marking system was established in 1922. Route 18 followed the auto trail from Portland northwest to Montpelier, where it continued to Burlington via Route 14. Many of the states along the route also assigned numbers to the highway; for instance, New York labeled their portion New York State Route 3 in 1924. The Joint Board on Interstate Highways distributed its preliminary plan in 1925, in which a long section of the highway was labeled US 2, from St. Ignace, Michigan, west to Bonners Ferry, Idaho. East of St. Ignace, instead of crossing to the Lower Peninsula of Michigan like the Roosevelt Highway, the proposed US 2 traveled north to the international border at Sault Ste. Marie. It reappeared at Rouses Point, New York, following Route 30 and then rejoining the auto trail between Burlington and Montpelier. US 2 and the Roosevelt Highway both connected Montpelier to St. Johnsbury, but the latter took a direct path along Route 18, while the former was assigned to Route 25 to Wells River, where it overlapped proposed US 5 north to St. Johnsbury. There, where the Roosevelt Highway turned southeast to Portland, US 2 continued east along Route 15 to Bangor and Route 1 to Calais, then heading north on Route 24 to end in Houlton.

By the time the U.S. Highway system was finalized in late 1926, one relatively minor change had been made to US 2; it was swapped with US 1 between Bangor and Houlton, Maine, placing US 2 along the entire portion of Route 15 east of St. Johnsbury. Several other major parts of the auto trail received numbers, most notably US 30 from Portland, Oregon east to Pendleton, US 195 in eastern Washington, and US 23 in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. In the mid-1930s, much of New York&#x27;s portion of the road became US 104, and the part southeast of Littleton, New Hampshire, to Portland, Maine, became US 302, but by far the longest piece was that followed by US 2 between St. Ignace and Bonners Ferry. In 1946, US 2 was extended west of its original western terminus in Bonners Ferry in Idaho to Everett in Washington via Spokane along what was then US 10A.


===Michigan===
US 2 was in the original 1925 U.S. Highway plan by the Bureau of Public Roads and was first commissioned in Michigan in 1926.

US 2 originally ran in Michigan from Ironwood to St. Ignace, the same terminuses as today. The highway has undergone many realignments, mostly minor, between those cities since 1926. In 1933, the section between St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie was relocated along Mackinac Trail.

In 1957, the first segment of a new freeway opened between St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie. It ran from Evergreen Shores, north of St. Ignace, to present-day M-123 and replaced the former route on State Street and Mackinac Trail. Over the next six years, US 2 was moved from Mackinac Trail onto the new freeway as new sections opened. Beginning in 1961, the freeway was concurrently signed as an extension of I-75. The freeway was completed in 1963.

The eastern terminus of US 2 in Michigan was truncated back to St. Ignace in 1983, removing it entirely from the I-75 freeway.

===New England===

Before being designated as US 2, most of the current alignment was called New England Interstate Route 15 from Danville, Vermont, eastward to Maine. The portion of the old Route 15 that did not become part of US 2 was designated as Vermont Route 15.

Other sections of US 2 in Vermont that were not part of New England Route 15 were parts of other former New England Interstate routes: Route 18 between Montpelier and Danville; Route 14 between Burlington and Montpelier; and Route 30 between Alburgh and Burlington.

==Auxiliary routes==

There have been at least three different three-digit child routes for US 2:

*US 102, a now defunct route that has been incorporated into US 141 in Michigan
*US 202, a northeast–southwest route in the northeastern U.S. whose southern terminus is in New Castle, Delaware, and runs northeast to its terminus near its parent route in Bangor, Maine
*US 302, an east–west route in New England whose western terminus is at its parent in Montpelier, Vermont, and whose eastern terminus is in Portland, Maine

<text>An escort agency is a company that provides escorts for clients, usually for sexual services. The agency typically arranges a meeting between one of its escorts and the client at the customer&#x27;s house or hotel room (outcall), or at the escort&#x27;s residence (incall). Some agencies also provide escorts for longer durations, who may stay with the client or travel along on a holiday or business trip. While the escort agency is paid a fee for this booking and dispatch service, the customer must negotiate any additional fees or arrangements directly with the escort for any other services that are not provided by the agency involved, such as providing sexual services (regardless of the legality of these services).

==Business model==
Escort agencies claim that they are dispatching these individuals to provide a social or conversational service rather than a sexual service, since prostitution laws often forbid taking payment for sex or communicating for the purpose of arranging a contract for sexual services. Advertisements for escort agencies often carefully skirt the legal line, and avoid specifically offering prostitution or sexual services. This fact in turn is well known to police and the political powers, who, where prostitution is illegal, usually prefer to act against more visible and problematic street prostitution. This has been criticized as hypocrisy, especially where governments license and tax the escort agencies. However, there almost certainly do exist agencies that do go by these laws and do not facilitate prostitution. Some countries have used a two-pronged approach of criminalizing street prostitution but permitting or licensing prostitution in brothels or via escort agencies.

===Recruiting===
Escort agencies often recruit individuals to work as escorts by placing employment advertisements in a magazine or newspaper. Escort agencies typically maintain a list of escorts of different ages and appearances to cater to the varying interests of clients. Some agencies may specifically deal in a certain type of escort. There are male-for-male, female-for-male, and female-for-female escort agencies, as well as a few male-for-female agencies. Agencies commonly specialize in only one sex. Transsexual or transgender escorts are available from some escort agencies.

It is very common for escorts to enter the business through referrals from friends who have been in the business. The effectiveness of ads in weeklies or specialized sites has been questioned by some operators as there are so many that they are diluted. Typically, an escort will interview with an agency.

===Advertising===
Once an escort is hired by an agency, they will provide photographs or pose for a photographer. These pictures are posted on the agency&#x27;s website or circulated among clients to promote business.

Some larger escort agencies maintain websites with photo galleries of their escorts. Clients contact agencies by telephone and offer a description of what kind of escorts are sought. The agency will then suggest an escort who might fit that client&#x27;s need.

The agency collects the client&#x27;s contact information and calls the escort. Usually, to protect the identity of the escort and ensure effective communication with the client, the agency arranges the appointment. Sometimes, it may be up to the escort to contact the client directly to make arrangements for the location and time of an appointment. Generally, the escort is also expected to call the agency upon arrival at the location and upon leaving, to ensure the safety of the escort.

==Legal considerations==
The arm&#x27;s-length relationship between the escort and the escort agency is designed to protect the escort agency (to some degree) from prosecution for breaking laws against prostitution. If the employee is solely responsible for arranging any illegal prostitution-oriented activities, the agency can maintain plausible deniability should an arrest be made.

Escort services aim to provide an experience that allows the operators to claim that whatever happens between the escort and the client is consensual. Operators tend to avoid discussing specifics over the telephone or via emails to avoid complications with the law.

===India===
Prostitution in India is legal, but a number of related activities, including owning or managing a brothel, pimping and pandering, are crimes.

===Mexico===

In 2010, Mexico legislators added a law similar to that of the UK called the Anti Trafficking in Persons Act (rough translation) which makes it a crime to offer the sexual services of another person against their will. The law is still broadly interpreted and has many websites which offer the services of escorts running for cover, and newspapers like &quot;El Universal&quot; stopped taking classified ads for escorts or &quot;executive massages&quot; because of the law, which also goes after anyone promoting the trafficking of persons. The legislator who is spearheading the campaign there has filed a lawsuit against the newspaper &quot;Reforma&quot; because they have not stopped taking classified ads for these services but have instead put in place a mandatory presentation of official identification of the person placing the ad and the signing of a waiver stating that they are placing the ad on their own behalf and releasing the newspaper from anything that may come from the services offered.

The legislature in Mexico has modified the law to close some loopholes or grey areas and is, like the United States, zooming in on the &quot;end user&quot; or client. The new law encompasses penalties of 7–9 years in prison for contracting an escort, 7–9 years in prison for transporting an escort to her appointment, and now the broadest addition like in the United States, &quot;facilitation&quot; of any person, persons or company that promotes or services of an escort whether a newspaper, internet ad or website is subject to 9–11 years in prison, which grows to a maximum of 23 years if the offending person is a public servant of any kind.

===United Kingdom===

Escort prostitution is one of the forms that the sex trade takes in the United Kingdom, along with prostitution practiced in massage parlors, saunas, private flats (such as the Soho walk-ups) and street prostitution. Working as an outcall escort is not an offence, and neither is working as a prostitute in private. However, under the Policing and Crime Act 2009 it is a criminal offence to pay for services of a prostitute who is controlled for gain if any third party uses force, threat (whether or not relating to violence) or any other form of coercion. In 2015 the HMRC set up a dedicated &quot;adult entertainment task force&quot; to collect unpaid income tax from, among others, online escort agencies.

==Financial considerations==
The amount of money that is made by an escort varies with many factors, such as sexual attractiveness, competition from legal and illegal sources, and the commissions to be paid to the agency. Typically, an agency will charge their escorts either a flat fee for each client connection or a percentage of the pre-arranged rate. According to police in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, the high fees charged by escort agencies may make escorting less lucrative than street prostitution, especially as agencies often also deduct the license fees directly from the earnings.

Independent escorts may have differing fees depending on the season or whether the client is a regular or semi-regular customer. Independent escorts may tend to see clients for extended meetings involving dinner or social activities whereas agency escorts tend to be split into two categories: Cheaper services, especially if mainly based on incall appointments (client visiting the escort at her accommodation), often only provide sexual services, while agencies that provide mainly outcall appointments (the escort visiting the client at either their home or hotel) tend to offer services similar to that of independent escorts.

In New York City, escort services charge anywhere from $200 to $1,500 or more per hour. The industry standard for dividing the money is 50% to the escort, 40% to the agency, and 10% to the booker (a kind of sales representative). Given the level of business can vary week to week, it is not uncommon for escorts to be featured by more than one agency provided they are operated by the same ownership group.

==Statistics==
A 2005 government survey in New Zealand (where prostitution was regulated and for the most part legalized in 2003) estimated that of the 6,000 prostitutes surveyed, around 20% worked for escort agencies.

<text>The term township, in Canada, is generally the district or area associated with a town. The specific use of the term to describe political subdivisions has varied by country, usually to describe a local rural or semirural government within the country itself.

In Eastern Canada, a township is one form of the subdivision of a county. In Quebec, the term is &quot;canton&quot; in French.

==Maritimes==
The historic colony of Nova Scotia (present-day Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island) used the term &quot;township&quot; as a subdivision of counties and as a means of attracting settlers to the colony. In Prince Edward Island, the colonial survey of 1764 established 67 townships, known as lots, and 3 royalties, which were grouped into parishes and hence into counties; the townships were geographically and politically the same. In New Brunswick, parishes have taken over as the present-day subdivision of counties, and present-day Nova Scotia uses districts as appropriate.

==Ontario==
In Ontario, there are both geographic townships and township municipalities. Geographic townships are the original historical administrative subdivisions surveyed and established primarily in the 1800s. They are used primarily for geographic purposes, such as land surveying, natural resource exploration and tracking of phenomena such as forest fires or tornados, but are not political entities. Township municipalities, also called &quot;political townships&quot;, are areas that have been incorporated with municipal governments, and are a lower-tier municipality (if located in a county or regional municipality, i.e. in Southern Ontario) or single-tier municipality (if located in a district, i.e. in Northern Ontario).

A township municipality may consist of a portion of one or more geographic townships united as a single entity with a single municipal administration. Often rural counties are subdivided into townships. In some places, usually if the township is in a county rather than in a regional municipality, the head of a political township may be called a &quot;reeve&quot;, not a mayor. However, the distinction is changing as many rural townships are replacing the title with &quot;mayor&quot; to reduce confusion. A few townships keep both titles and designate &quot;mayor&quot; as the head of the municipal council and use &quot;reeve&quot; to denote the representative to the upper tier (usually county) council.

The term &quot;geographic township&quot; is also used in reference to former political townships that were abolished or superseded as part of municipal government restructuring.

==Quebec==

In Quebec, townships are called &quot;cantons&quot; in French and can also be political and geographic, similar to Ontario although the geographic use is not used much or at all. They were introduced after the British Conquest, primarily as a surveying unit. They were designated and cover most of the unattributed territory in Eastern Quebec and what is now known as the Eastern Townships and later used in surveying the Outaouais and Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean regions.

Townships often served as the territorial basis for new municipalities, but township municipalities are no different from other types such as parish or village municipalities.

==Prairies and BC==
In the Prairie Provinces and parts of British Columbia, a township is a division of the Dominion Land Survey. Townships are (mostly) squares, about in area. The townships are not political units (although political boundaries often follow township boundaries) but exist only to define parcels of land relatively simply. Townships are divided into 36 equal square parcels, known as &quot;sections.&quot; In Saskatchewan, a political unit called a rural municipality in general is 3 townships by 3 townships in size, or 18 miles squared, about .

Three municipalities in British Columbia, Langley, Esquimalt and Spallumcheen, have &quot;township&quot; in their official names but legally hold the status of district municipalities.

<doc id="447273" wikidata="Q7830212" url="?curid=447273" title="Township (England)">
<text>In England, a township (Latin: &quot;villa&quot;) is a local division or district of a large parish containing a village or small town usually having its own church. A township may or may not be coterminous with a chapelry, manor, or any other minor area of local administration.

The township is distinguished from the following:
*Vill: traditionally, among legal historians, a &quot;vill&quot; referred to the tract of land of a rural community, whereas &quot;township&quot; was used when referring to the tax and legal administration of that community. 
*Chapelry: the &#x27;parish&#x27; of a chapel (a church without full parochial functions).
*Tithing: the basic unit of the medieval Frankpledge system.
&#x27;Township&#x27; is, however, sometimes used loosely for any of the above.

==History==

In many areas of England, the basic unit of civil administration was the parish, generally identical with the ecclesiastical parish. However, in some cases, particularly in Northern England, there was a lesser unit called a township, being a subdivision of a parish. This could happen for several reasons: 
*In some parts of Northern England, the parishes were too large to be managed conveniently. For example, Sheffield constituted a single parish, which had six townships in it — Ecclesall Bierlow, Brightside Bierlow, Attercliffe cum Darnall, Nether Hallam, Upper Hallam, and Sheffield itself. Whalley parish, in Lancashire, contained 47 townships and extended over 43,000 ha (105,000 ac). 
*There or elsewhere, occasionally, different parts of a parish were in different hundreds or counties.
* Sometimes, one township included parts of several different parishes, as in Heworth near York, which included parts of the parishes of St Saviour, St Cuthbert and St Giles.

The local historian Dorothy Silvester has identified a &quot;parish line&quot;, which divided northern from southern counties of England and Wales. In Denbighshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, the West Riding and North Riding of Yorkshire, and north of this line, parishes tended on the whole to be large, containing several townships. However, south of this line, parishes tended to contain single townships.

A township appointed overseers of the poor and surveyors of highways in the same way as a parish and they financed their obligations by levying a rate, in the same way as parish officials. The original definition of a civil parish was any place in respect of which a rate could lawfully be levied. Most townships disappeared before 1866 either being included into adjacent civil parishes or gaining their own separate civil parish status.

==Modern use==
The use of the term &#x27;township&#x27; persisted and has recently been revived as a name for subdivisions of boroughs in northern England. For example, the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale has township committees, and the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan divides the borough into ten townships, which each have a township forum. Wirral is divided into forty-four, for planning purposes.

In Sheffield, Mosborough ward, which includes the districts of Halfway, Mosborough village, Waterthorpe, and Westfield, is one of the 28 electoral wards in the City of Sheffield. It is located in the eastern part of the city and is one of the wards that make up the Sheffield Attercliffe parliamentary constituency. The area is often referred to as Mosborough Townships, but this usage does not have any administrative significance.

In Shropshire, the name of Ruyton-XI-Towns preserves the memory only of medieval townships, eleven of which had been united under one manor; in Herefordshire, Bromyard still has areas referred to by the names of three townships besides that of the central town area.

<doc id="447275" wikidata="Q519630" url="?curid=447275" title="Township (South Africa)">
<text>In South Africa, the terms [[township]] and location usually refers to an under-developed, racially segregated urban area, from the late 19th century until the end of apartheid, were reserved for non-whites, namely Black Africans, Coloureds and Indians. Townships were usually built on the periphery of towns and cities. The term &quot;township&quot; also has a distinct legal meaning in South Africa&#x27;s system of land title, which carries no racial connotations.

Townships for non-whites were also called &quot;locations&quot; or &quot;lokasies&quot; in Afrikaans and are often still referred to as such in the smaller towns. The slang term &quot;kasie / kasi&quot;, a popular short version of &quot;lokasie&quot; is also used. Townships sometimes have large informal settlements nearby.

== History ==
===Early development===
During 1900–1950 (roughly), the majority of the black population in the major urban areas lived in hostels or servants&#x27; accommodations, these were provided by employers, and the workers were mostly single men. In the period during and following World War II, urban areas of South Africa experienced a rapid period of urbanisation as the colour bar was relaxed due to the war. Neither employers nor the government built new accommodations or homes for the influx of new residents. This led to overcrowding, and poor living conditions, thus, contributing to high levels of crime and violence. High rents and overcrowding led to land invasions and the growth of shack settlements, which were largely ignored by the government.

By 1950, a large portion of the urban black population lived in townships. In 1950, upwards of 100,000 people were living in townships in the Witwatersrand area; 50,000 people lived in Cato Manor in Durban; and an estimated 150,000 black and coloured people lived in townships in Cape Town.

Living conditions in the shack township settlements were poor, but they had some advantage over the other more established options, like hostels, of being cheap and largely unregulated by the apartheid-era South African Police.

===Apartheid: 1948–1994===
In 1950, the Group Areas Act was enacted, which empowered the Governor-General to designate land for the sole use of a specific race. Under this law, black people were evicted from properties that were in areas designated as &quot;white only&quot; and forced to move into segregated townships. Separate townships were established for each of the three designated non-white race groups: black people, Coloureds, and Indians – as per the Population Registration Act, 1950.

=== Post-apartheid ===
Most South African towns and cities have at least one township associated with them. Some old townships have seen rapid development since 1994, with, for instance, wealthy and middle-income areas sprouting in parts of Soweto and Chatsworth. Despite their origins in apartheid South Africa, today the terms township, location, and informal settlement are not used pejoratively. However, policymakers are, as in the 1950s, once again using the term &#x27;slums&#x27; in a highly pejorative way.

==Social issues==

Informal settlements that are normally self established around regulated townships are faced with several social problems. Most often, the residents of informal settlements do not own the land on which their houses are built. In effect, these houses are built illegally. Construction is informal and unregulated by the government. This results in a lack of access to basic services such as sewerage, electricity, roads, and clean water, which adversely affects the residents&#x27; quality of life.

===Infrastructure problems===
Sewerage, water, and electrical infrastructure within townships are often in need of repair, resulting in a lack of sanitation due to problems with accessibility and availability. Electricity, water, and sewerage are managed by different government departments, resulting in inefficiencies in the absence of substantial coordination at all stages of the project planning, budgeting, and implementation cycle.

====Sewerage====

The sewer systems within townships are poorly planned and constructed. The population of townships typically grows faster than what the infrastructure was planned for, causing overloads that result in blockages, surges, and overflows. There often are only a limited number of public toilets that are overused, abused, and quickly become health hazards for the communities. Another issue is poor access to maintenance activities, which is caused by a lack of space between houses. Some of the areas on the township peripheries or near the riverbanks do not have access to sanitation facilities because they are not connected to the formal waterborne sewerage system.

====Water====
A consequence of inadequate pumping infrastructure and large populations is that the water pressure in the townships is very low. Each section of the townships normally has one pump per section. The water is used for everything from washing clothes to cooking, drinking, bathing, and cleaning the house. Having limited water accessible to each section makes it very hard to meet the daily water needs per household. 
====Electricity====
Illegal electricity connections are all-pervasive in the townships with electrical wires strung along the trees leading to power boxes. Although dangerous, every house in the area has a wire coming out of it and every wire is known by their owner in order to fix problems as soon as they arise. Most of the sub-stations are very unsecured to begin with so having so many additional wires coming from them is very dangerous for the people nearby and the kids playing in the area. The electricity infrastructure has not undergone upgrades because of the government&#x27;s disinclination to encourage power usage by non-residents.
===Flood risk===
Some townships, such as Alexandra and Diepsloot, are built near rivers, and on flood plains. These areas are extremely dense with only tortuous, narrow access, few communal water points and banks of chemical toilets on the peripheries of the settlements. The settlements are beginning to be built in the old tributaries due to the continuing growth of the townships. Constructing houses in the dried up tributaries is a potential problem in the event of a large storm as the tributary starts to fill up with water again or in case of a backup of sewerage coming into the tributary. The houses built in that area stand the risk of being destroyed by natural occurrences. As the area grows, the tributaries are piped and a number of concrete aprons and gullies are constructed over the tributary into which the communal water points drain. The gullies are then choked with garbage and the tributaries appear to be substantially blocked but this will not hold off the water for very long if a flood comes through. Due to overcrowding, residents choose to build on river banks in hopes of easy access to water and laundry facilities, however, the available water is unsuitable for these purposes due to pollution, and they remain vulnerable to floods.

===Backyard shacks===
Backyard shacks are additional units on a plot of land that are rented out by the land owner for additional income. Plots of land designed for single-family houses have been turned into plots, that, on average hold six families instead of one. These structures are illegally built in violation of planning and building codes and strain the infrastructure. Governments are loath to act on backyard dwellings, as doing so would result in large-scale displacement of people. A 2001 study of the township called Diepsloot near Johannesburg showed that 24% of the residents lived in brick structures, 43% were in shack areas, and 27% were in backyard shacks.

===Education===
Township schools are often overcrowded, and lack adequate infrastructure. There is a high dropout rate among poor youth, particularly around Grade 9. Despite government interventions, education outcomes remain skewed, with township students continuing to under-perform. This skewed distribution is mainly attributable to higher and more rapid drop-out rates among the poor, rather than to a lack of initial access to schooling. The formerly white schools uniformly produce better results as their governing bodies are able to raise substantial private funds. These funds are used to get resources that are usually inaccessible for the rural and township schools which survive on the commitment of their teachers.

===Gangs and violence===
Gangs are a problem in townships and children as young as 12 or 13 get initiated into local gangs. Some see violence and gangs as a way of life and a part of their culture. The weapon of choice for most is a gun and with easy accessibility anyone is able to get one. It is estimated that out of the 14 million guns in circulation, in South Africa, only four million are registered and licensed to legal gun owners.

==Legal meaning==

The legal meaning of the term &quot;township&quot; in South Africa differs from the popular usage and has a precise legal meaning without any racial connotations. The term is used in land titles and townships are subdivided into erfs (stands). &quot;Township&quot; can also mean a designated area or district, as part of a place name. For instance &quot;Industrial Township&quot; has been used in reference to an industrial area, e.g. &quot;Westmead Industrial Township&quot;, in Pinetown, South Africa.

Often a township (in the legal sense) is established and then the adjoining townships, with the same name as the original township, and with a numbered &quot;Extension&quot; suffix are later established. For example, the Johannesburg suburb of Bryanston has an extension called &quot;Bryanston Extension 3&quot;.

===Relationship with &quot;suburb&quot;===
In traditionally or historically white areas, the term &quot;suburb&quot; is used for legally-defined residential townships in everyday conversation.

A suburb&#x27;s boundaries are often regarded as being the same as the (legal) township boundaries, along with its numbered extensions, and it usually shares its name with the township (with some notable exceptions, such as the Johannesburg suburb known as Rivonia, which is actually the township of Edenburg with numbered extensions called Rivonia Extensions).

Occasionally, formerly independent towns, such as Sandton (which itself consists of numerous suburbs), are referred to as &quot;suburbs&quot;.

<text>The Cyclopean Isles (Italian: &quot;Isole Ciclopi&quot;), noted for their rows of basaltic columns piled one above another, lie not far from Mount Etna off the eastern coast of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea.

==Geology==
Formed about 500,000 years ago, the Cyclopean Isles are of volcanic origin and may at one time have been attached to Sicily.

The Cyclopean Isles strongly resemble the Giant&#x27;s Causeway on the northern coast of Northern Ireland, and the Isle of Staffa off the western coast of Scotland. The latter, closest in appearance to the Cyclopean pair, differs mainly in having the columns piled in terraces, one above another.

A mineral known as analcime can be found in the Cyclopean Isles and was first discovered on the Cyclopean Isles in lava by French geologist Déodat de Dolomieu.

==Homer&#x27;s legend==
There is an ancient tradition that the islands at one time formed part of the mainland of Sicily.

Homer has a curious story about the manner in which they became detached, towards the end of the ninth book of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. When Odysseus visited Sicily it was inhabited by the Cyclopes, said to have had only one eye, on the forehead.

Odysseus encounters one of their number, Polyphemus, on his journey home to Ithaca, who kills two of Odysseus&#x27;s men. Stuck inside Polyphemus&#x27;s cave because he and his men are unable to move the boulder that blocks the entrance, Odysseus supplies Polyphemus with a special wine until he falls asleep, and blinds him by drilling the Cyclops&#x27;s own wooden walking stick into his eye. Polyphemus opens the cave boulder and the Greeks escape to their ship; Polyphemus calls to the other Cyclopes for help and Odysseus, from the distance of his ship, begins to taunt and to jeer at him. Homer (Alexander Pope&#x27;s translation) says:
Odysseus boasts that it was &quot;Odysseus... Son of Laertes&quot; who had burnt out Polyphemus&#x27;s eye. Polyphemus invokes the vengeance of his father Poseidon, and:

<text>A township in some states of the United States is a small geographic area.

The term is used in three ways.
#A survey township is a geographic reference used to define property location for deeds and grants as surveyed and platted by the United States General Land Office (GLO). A survey township is nominally six by six miles square, or 23,040 acres (93.200 km2).
#A civil township is a unit of local government, generally a civil division of a county. Counties are the primary divisional entities in many states, thus the powers and organization of townships varies from state to state. Civil townships are generally given a name, sometimes written with the included abbreviation &quot;Twp&quot;.
#A charter township, found only in the state of Michigan, is similar to a civil township. Provided certain conditions are met, a charter township is mostly exempt from annexation to contiguous cities or villages, and carries additional rights and responsibilities of home rule.

==Survey townships==


Survey townships are generally referred to by a number based on the Public Land Survey System (PLSS). A reference to the township will look something like &quot;Township 2 North Range 3 East&quot;, or &quot;T2N,R3E&quot; and such a notation is used in property descriptions based on the PLSS. Townships were originally surveyed and platted by the United States General Land Office, using contracted private survey crews, and are marked on the United States Geological Survey maps of the United States.

Townships are normally a square approximately on a side with cardinal boundaries conforming to meridians and parallels, containing 36 sections of each. The northern and westernmost tier of sections in each township are designed to take up the convergence of the east and west township boundary lines or range lines, as well as any error in the survey measurements, and therefore these sections vary slightly from being one square mile or . Survey townships exist in some form in most states other than the original Thirteen Colonies, Kentucky, Tennessee, Vermont, and Maine. Irregular or fractional townships with fewer than a full 36 sections are created where full townships cannot be laid out due to existing senior boundaries, such as Spanish/Mexican ranchos, Indian reservations, state boundary lines, etc.

In Kentucky, the Jackson Purchase (the area west of the Tennessee River) is divided into townships and ranges. In Tennessee, the entire state is surveyed into townships and ranges that make up 13 survey districts of the Tennessee State Survey. In extreme northern Maine there is an area divided into townships and ranges oriented to true north. A region in the central part of the state, made up of 17 surveys, is divided into townships, but these are not oriented to true north. The remainder of the state is on metes and bounds. Similarly, Vermont and New Hampshire are mostly metes-and-bounds states, but have areas in the north that are surveyed into townships not oriented to true north. Most of Ohio is surveyed using the Public Land Survey System, but several sizable areas are metes-and-bounds, including the Virginia Military Reserve, Donation Tract, French Grant and the three Moravian grants (Gnadenhutten, Schoenbrunn and Salem). A area in southern Indiana (Clark&#x27;s Grant) is not surveyed into townships, but is still a gridded survey. Portions of the Texas State Survey use square townships. Sizeable portions of Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington, are unsurveyed. Substantial swampy areas in Florida and Louisiana are also unsurveyed.

Both New York and Pennsylvania have metes-and-bounds surveys, but in the western parts of these states, the metes-and-bounds form square townships many of which are also civil townships. Besides these, nearly every state has areas of metes-and-bounds that were never included in the grids (like along major rivers) or were removed from the grid, usually due to surveying mistakes.

==Civil townships==

The township government is a unit of local government, often rural. Townships are geographic and political subdivisions of a county. The township is identified by a name, such as Penn Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. The responsibilities and the form of the township government is specified by the state legislature.

The most common form of township government has an elected board of trustees or supervisors. Some additional offices, such as clerk or constable, may also be elected. The most common governmental responsibilities of townships include oversight of such things as road maintenance, land-use planning, and trash collection. Many townships in Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania provide police and fire protection, similar to what an incorporated city would provide.

In most midwestern states, a civil township often corresponds to a single survey township, although in less populated areas, the civil township may be made up of all or portions of several survey townships. In areas where there are natural features such as a lake or river, the civil township boundaries may follow the geographic features rather than the survey township boundaries. Municipalities such as cities may incorporate or annex land in a township, which is then generally removed from township government. Only one state, Indiana, has township governments covering all its area and population. In other states, some types of municipalities, like villages, remain a part of the township while cities are not. As urban areas expand, a civil township may entirely disappear—see, for example, Mill Creek Township, Hamilton County, Ohio. In other expanding urban areas, the township may incorporate itself into a city; this can be seen in the numerous square cities of Hennepin, Anoka, and Washington counties in Minnesota. The Montgomery County, Ohio, cities of Trotwood (1996, formerly Madison Township), Huber Heights (1980, Wayne Township), and Kettering (1955, Van Buren Township) are further examples of townships incorporating into cities.

Pennsylvania and New Jersey have civil townships that are not based on the PLSS survey system, but on the older metes and bounds survey system. A New Jersey township differs only in name from other municipalities: its boundaries are fixed, it is an incorporated body, and it is free to adopt another form of government. The federal government formerly had a revenue sharing arrangement that separately allocated funding for townships and other minor civil division types such as cities or boroughs; some New Jersey municipalities, such as the Township of the Borough of Verona or Township of South Orange Village, changed their names to qualify for additional federal aid at the expense of municipalities of other types.

Utah and Nevada have areas called townships, but they are not the same as civil townships. These areas are not separate governments, but have been granted some degree of self-rule by a county.

==Charter townships==

Michigan has created charter townships as a separate type of government to allow greater flexibility for township governments to serve urbanized populations. In Michigan, as in other states with like systems (though sometimes different names), a township is an administrative division of a county, which is an administrative division of the state. Counties and townships are local organs through which state law and public policy are administered, adapted to local need to the extent the law allows. A charter township is a township that has been granted a charter, which allows it certain rights and responsibilities of home rule that are generally intermediary in scope between those of a city (a semi-autonomous jurisdiction in Michigan) and a village, which (unless it is a home-rule village) is subject to the authority of the township(s) in which it is located.

Charter townships may also reorganize themselves into municipalities, as can be seen in Wayne County, Michigan, and elsewhere in the Detroit metropolitan area.

==Census statistics==
Towns and townships are sometimes considered minor civil divisions of counties by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes. According to the Census Bureau, in 2002, town or township government applied to 16,504 organized governments in the following 20 states:

*Connecticut (towns)
*Illinois
*Indiana
*Kansas
*Maine (towns)
*Massachusetts (towns)
*Michigan
*Minnesota
*Missouri
*Nebraska
*New Hampshire (towns)
*New Jersey
*New York (towns)
*North Dakota
*Ohio
*Pennsylvania
*Rhode Island (towns)
*South Dakota
*Vermont (towns)
*Wisconsin (towns)

This categorization includes governmental units officially designated as &quot;towns&quot; in the New England states, New York, and Wisconsin, some plantations in Maine and locations in New Hampshire. In Minnesota, the terms town and township are used interchangeably with regard to township governments. Although towns in the six New England states and New York, and townships in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, are legally termed municipal corporations, perform municipal-type functions, and frequently serve densely populated urban areas, they have no necessary relation to concentration of population, and are thus counted for census purposes as town or township governments. Even in states beyond New England, townships often serve urbanized areas and provide municipal services typically provided by incorporated municipalities.

The count of 16,504 organized township governments does not include unorganized township areas (where the township may exist in name only, but has no organized government) or where the townships are coextensive with cities and the cities have absorbed the township functions. It also does not include the townships in Iowa (see Iowa townships), which are not separate governments, but are classified as subordinate agencies of county governments.

Of the 16,504 town or township governments, only 1,179 (7.1 percent) had as many as 10,000 inhabitants in the 2000 census and 52.4 percent of all towns or townships had fewer than 1000 inhabitants. There was a decline in the number of town or township governments from 16,629 in 1997 to 16,504 in 2002. Nearly all of the decline involved townships in the Midwest.

==Usage by state==
Because township government is defined by each state, the use of this form also varies by state. States using a township form include the following:
*Township government is used in Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Wisconsin (in Wisconsin known as towns).
*The form is used in parts of Illinois and also in Nebraska, where they are sometimes referred to as precincts. Two cases of this use of terminology are Edwards and Wabash counties in Illinois.
*The New England states have a similar concept of local government, but combine the municipal and area government forms into a town; this is the locus of the town meeting. These states are Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. New York also has incorporated townships, called towns, although they have fewer powers than New England towns.
**The word &quot;township&quot; in Maine instead refers to sections of unorganized territories.
*Some states formerly used township governments, or have some vestige of named townships. These include Arkansas, California, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Washington, and West Virginia.

<text>Milan Babić (; 25 February 1956 – 5 March 2006) was a Croatian Serb politician and war criminal who served as the first president of the Republic of Serbian Krajina, a self-proclaimed state largely populated by Serbs of Croatia that wished to break away from Croatia during the Croatian War of Independence.

After the war, he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 2004 and was the first ever indictee to plead guilty and enter a plea bargain with the prosecution, after which he was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Babić expressed &quot;shame and remorse&quot; in a public statement and declared that his plea bargain was intended to relieve the collective shame of the Croatian Serbs, and asked his &quot;Croatian brothers to forgive their Serb brothers&quot; for their actions.

After he was sentenced in 2004, Babić was found dead in his prison cell in The Hague in March 2006, in an apparent suicide.

==Early life==
Milan Babić, the son of Božo Babić, was born in 1956 in the village of Kukar near the town of Vrlika, in PR Croatia, FPR Yugoslavia. In 1981 he graduated from Belgrade University&#x27;s School of Dentistry and became a stomatologist. In 1989, he became one of the directors of the medical centre in Knin, a largely Serb-inhabited town in southwestern Croatia. He entered politics in 1990, as Yugoslavia began to disintegrate, leaving his membership in the League of Communists of Croatia (SKH) and joining the newly established Serb nationalist party called the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) at its inception, on 17 February 1990. He was elected President of the Municipal Assembly of Knin shortly afterwards. At the time, Serbs comprised about 12.2% of Croatia&#x27;s population, forming a majority in a strip of land known as &quot;Krajina&quot; along the Croatian-Bosnian border. Croatia&#x27;s move towards independence following the election of President Franjo Tuđman in late 1990 were strongly opposed by its ethnic Serb minority, which was supported both politically and militarily by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) and SR Serbia under President Slobodan Milošević. Serb nationalists in the &quot;Krajina&quot; then established a Serbian National Council, a body designed to coordinate Serb opposition to Croatia&#x27;s independence; Babić was elected its President.

==Croatian war==

Ethnic Serbs soon became hostile to remaining in an independent Croatia. After Tuđman was elected, Croatia&#x27;s first democratic constitution was drafted, which demoted ethnic Serbs to a minority status within the country.

In September 1990, a referendum was held in the Krajina asking local voters if they agreed with Serb &quot;sovereignty and autonomy&quot; in Croatia, which was passed by a majority of 99.7%. The vote was declared illegal and invalid by the Croatian government. Babić&#x27;s administration in Knin then announced the creation of a Serb Autonomous Oblast, named SAO Krajina, on 21 December 1990, and on 1 April 1991 it declared that it would secede from Croatia to join Serbia. Other Serb-dominated communities in eastern Croatia announced that they also would join the SAO.

Babić was elected President of the Executive Council of the SAO on April 30, and was subsequently appointed Minister of the Interior and Minister of Defence by the Krajina Serb Assembly. In this capacity, he established an armed militia which set up road blocks in its territory, effectively severing the southern Croatian coastal region of Dalmatia from the rest of the country. Clashes between Krajina Serbs and Croatian security forces broke out almost immediately after Croatia declared independence on June 25, leaving dozens dead.

Around August 1991, Babić became a party to what war crimes prosecutors would later describe as a &quot;joint criminal enterprise&quot; to permanently forcibly remove the non-Serb population of the territory under his control, with the ultimate goal of making the region part of a new Serb-dominated state. According to prosecutors, his chief accomplices included Slobodan Milošević, other Krajina Serb figures such as Milan Martić, the Serb paramilitary leader Vojislav Šešelj, and Yugoslav Army commanders including General Ratko Mladić, at the time the commander of JNA forces in Croatia. All of them were indicted for war crimes, and some have been convicted. According to Babić&#x27;s testimony during his war crimes trial, during the summer of 1991 the Serbian secret police – under Milošević&#x27;s command – set up &quot;a parallel structure of state security and the police of Krajina and units commanded by the state security of Serbia&quot;. A full-scale war was launched in which a large area of territory, amounting to a third of Croatia, was seized and the non-Serb population was either massacred or ethnically cleansed. The bulk of the fighting occurred between August and December 1991. Thousands more died and were deported in fighting in eastern Slavonia, but the JNA was the principal actor in that part of the conflict.

The international community attempted to resolve the conflict in November 1991 by proposing a peace plan put forward by the United Nations Special Envoy Cyrus Vance, under which the Krajina would be demilitarised and protected by a UN peacekeeping force while political talks on its future took place. Babić strongly opposed this, instead renaming the SAO Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) on 19 December 1991 (which later absorbed the Serb-held areas of eastern Croatia in February 1992). He urged the Krajina Serb Assembly to reject the Vance plan. However, Milošević disagreed with this position: his strategic aims in Croatia had largely been achieved, and the JNA was needed for the looming war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Babić was sidelined and the Vance plan was pushed through the RSK Assembly on 16 February 1992. On 26 February 1992, Milošević engineered Babić&#x27;s removal in favour of Goran Hadžić, a more pliant figure who was reported to have boasted that he was merely &quot;a messenger for Slobodan Milošević&quot;.

Although Babić remained active in RSK politics as its Minister of Foreign Affairs, he was by then a greatly weakened figure. Babić stated that Krajina policy was controlled from Belgrade via the Serbian secret police; Milošević later denied this, claiming that Babić had made it up &quot;out of fear&quot;.

On 3 July 1992, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that aides to Milan Babić said he had been shot &quot;...in an attack by bodyguards of a rival leader and was &#x27;fighting for his life&#x27;...&quot; General elections were held in the RSK on 12 December 1993, with a second round of the presidential election on 23 January 1994. Martić received 54,000 fewer votes than Babić in the first round, but went on to win the second round with 104,234 votes.

The Bosnian Serbs&#x27; military collapse in July–August 1995 propelled Babić into the post of RSK Prime Minister, but he held this for only a few weeks. In early August 1995, the Croatian government launched Operation Storm to retake the entire area of the Krajina (with the exception of the strip in eastern Slavonia, which remained under Serb control until 1998). Babić fled to Serbia along with the entire Krajina Serb leadership and 200,000 Serbian refugees from the region (most of the Serb population in Krajina). He was said to have retired to a chicken farm in Vojvodina.

==Trial and plea bargain==
In December 2002, Babić was unexpectedly revealed as a witness against Slobodan Milošević as part of his plea bargain, testifying before the ICTY that Milošević had been personally involved in the war in Croatia. The following November, he was charged with five counts of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war. Although he did not initially enter a plea, he pleaded guilty on 27 January 2004 to one count of crime against humanity in an apparent plea bargain with ICTY prosecutors under which the remaining charges were dropped. He expressed &quot;shame and remorse&quot; in a public statement and declared that he had acted to relieve the collective shame of the Croatian Serbs, asking his &quot;Croatian brothers to forgive their Serb brothers&quot; for their actions. His confession to the charge of persecution, a crime against humanity, marked a major victory for the ICTY prosecutors, as Babić was, prior to his death, the only participant in the Croatian war to admit guilt. His testimony was of great importance to the prosecution in bolstering their contention that Milošević was the main actor in the &quot;joint criminal enterprise&quot; in Croatia.

In his own trial, Babić gave testimony that was used to indict Milošević. The former also appeared at the trial of the latter to give evidence. In one case, Milošević denied that he supported Babić by quoting transcripts of his tapped telephone, where he referred to Babić as &quot;an idiot&quot;, &quot;ordinary scum&quot; and &quot;Tuđman&#x27;s trump.&quot;

In June 2004, Babić was sentenced to 13 years in prison after the court rejected the prosecutors&#x27; recommendation for an 11-year sentence. The court found him more responsible than the prosecutor characterized him as, but also gave Babić credit for voluntarily surrendering and pleading guilty. The court found that while &quot;Babić was not the prime mover... Babić chose to remain in power and provided significant support for the persecutions.&quot; Babić was sent to a secret location in Great Britain to serve his sentence, which was an unprecedented move by the court. This led to speculations that Babić had been given a privileged treatment in exchange for his testimony against other defendants. The official justification given for not disclosing his location was concern for his safety from people against whom he testified.

Fellow Serb leaders and commanders that Babić accused for war crimes in Croatia, during his trial in The Hague, involved Slobodan Milošević, Milan Martić, Jovica Stanišić, Franko Simatović, and Momčilo Krajišnik.

==Death==
Milan Babić was found dead after he reportedly committed suicide on 5 March 2006 while in the ICTY detention unit in The Hague, Netherlands, where he was in the midst of giving evidence against Milan Martić, his successor as President of the breakaway RSK. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Babić had hanged himself &quot;using his own leather belt.&quot;

Serbian Radical Party leader and fellow inmate, Vojislav Šešelj, claimed to have contributed to Babić&#x27;s suicide by &quot;making his life miserable.&quot; Šešelj added that the ICTY prosecution initially promised Babić that it would not press charges if he agreed to testify against fellow Serbs. The charges were pressed anyway (on one count).

<text>William Clifford (christened 14 December 1811 – 5 September 1841) was an English cricketer who played for Kent county teams between 1834 and 1841. He was a right-handed batsman and a slow bowler who often fielded as a wicket-keeper.

Clifford was christened at Bearsted in Kent in December 1811. He was the son of Robert and Catherine Clifford; his grandfather, also Robert Clifford, was a well-known all-rounder who bowled leg breaks for Kent sides at the end of the 18th-century and made more than 70 appearances in top-level matches. William&#x27;s brother, Francis Clifford, also played in first-class matches for Kent County Cricket Club during the mid-19th century.

Playing club cricket for a range of sides, including Bearsted and Leeds, William Clifford made his first-class cricket debut in 1834. Renowned as one of the best batsmen in the Kent side, he played 17 of his 29 first-class matches for Kent teams, often opening the batting. He played four times for the Players against the Gentlemen and for England sides and three times for the South against the North. In 1841 he opened a cricket ground, Rucks Lane, at Gravesend and played his final first-class matches the same year.

Clifford worked as a wheelwright before becoming a publican at Gravesend in 1837. He died in September 1841 of a &quot;bilious fever&quot;. He was probably aged less than 30.

<doc id="447288" wikidata="Q740602" url="?curid=447288" title="Project Athena">
<text>Project Athena was a joint project of MIT, Digital Equipment Corporation, and IBM to produce a campus-wide distributed computing environment for educational use. It was launched in 1983, and research and development ran until June 30, 1991. , Athena is still in production use at MIT. It works as software (currently a set of Debian packages) that makes a machine a thin client, that will download educational applications from the MIT servers on demand.

Project Athena was important in the early history of desktop and distributed computing. It created the X Window System, Kerberos, and Zephyr Notification Service. It influenced the development of thin computing, LDAP, Active Directory, and instant messaging.

== Description ==
Leaders of the $50 million, five-year project at MIT included Michael Dertouzos, director of the Laboratory for Computer Science; Jerry Wilson, dean of the School of Engineering; and Joel Moses, head of the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department. DEC agreed to contribute more than 300 terminals, 1600 microcomputers, 63 minicomputers, and five employees. IBM agreed to contribute 500 microcomputers, 500 workstations, software, five employees, and grant funding.

== History ==
In 1979 Dertouzos proposed to university president Jerome Wiesner that the university network mainframe computers for student use. At that time MIT used computers throughout its research, but undergraduates did not use computers except in Course VI (computer science) classes. With no interest from the rest of the university, the School of Engineering in 1982 approached DEC for equipment for itself. President Paul E. Gray and the MIT Corporation wanted the project to benefit the rest of the university, and IBM agreed to donate equipment to MIT except to the engineering school.

Project Athena began in May 1983. Its initial goals were to:
* Develop computer-based learning tools that are usable in multiple educational environments
* Establish a base of knowledge for future decisions about educational computing
* Create a computational environment supporting multiple hardware types
* Encourage the sharing of ideas, code, data, and experience across MIT

The project intended to extend computer power into fields of study outside computer science and engineering, such as foreign languages, economics, and political science. To implement these goals, MIT decided to build a Unix-based distributed computing system. Unlike those at Carnegie Mellon University, which also received the IBM and DEC grants, students did not have to own their own computer; MIT built computer labs for their users, although the goal was to put networked computers into each dormitory. Students were required to learn FORTRAN and Lisp, and would have access to 3M computers, capable of 1 million instructions per second and with 1 megabyte of RAM and a 1 megapixel display.

Although IBM and DEC computers were hardware-incompatible, Athena&#x27;s designers intended that software would run similarly on both. MIT did not want to be dependent on one vendor at the end of Athena. Sixty-three DEC VAX-11/750 servers were the first timesharing clusters. &quot;Phase II&quot; began in September 1987, with hundreds of IBM RT PC workstations replacing the VAXes, which became fileservers for the workstations. The DEC-IBM division between departments no longer existed. Upon logging into a workstation, students would have immediate access to a universal set of files and programs via central services. Because the workstation used a thin client model, the user interface would be consistent despite the use of different hardware vendors for different workstations. A small staff could maintain hundreds of clients.

The project spawned many technologies that are widely used today, such as the X Window System and Kerberos. Among the other technologies developed for Project Athena were the Zephyr Notification Service and the Hesiod name and directory service.

 MIT had 722 workstations in 33 private and public clusters on and off campus, including student living groups and fraternities. A survey found that 92% of undergraduates had used the Athena workstations at least once, and 25% used them every day. The project received an extension of three years in January 1988. Developers who had focused on creating the operating system and courseware for various educational subjects now worked to improve Athena&#x27;s stability and make it more user friendly. When Project Athena ended in June 1991, MIT&#x27;s IT department took it over and extended it into the university&#x27;s research and administrative divisions.

In 1993, the IBM RT PC workstations were retired, being replaced by Sun SPARCclassic, IBM RS/6000 POWERstation 220, and Personal DECstation 5000 Model 25 systems. the MIT campus had more than 1300 Athena workstations, and more than 6000 Athena users logged into the system daily. Athena is still used by many in the MIT community through the computer labs scattered around the campus. It is also now available for installation on personal computers, including laptops.

== Educational computing environment ==
Athena continues in use , providing a ubiquitous computing platform for education at MIT; plans are to continue its use indefinitely.

Athena was designed to minimize the use of labor in its operation, in part through the use of (what is now called ) &quot;thin client&quot; architecture and standard desktop configurations. This not only reduces labor content in operations but also minimizes the amount of training for deployment, software upgrade, and trouble-shooting. These features continue to be of considerable benefit today.

In keeping with its original intent, access to the Athena system has been greatly enlarged in the last several years. Whereas in 1991 much of the access was in public &quot;clusters&quot; (computer labs) in academic buildings, access has been extended to dormitories, fraternities and sororities, and independent living groups. All dormitories have officially supported Athena clusters. In addition, most dormitories have &quot;quick login&quot; kiosks, which is a standup workstation with a timer to limit access to ten minutes. The dormitories have &quot;one port per pillow&quot; Internet access.

Originally, the Athena release used Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) as the base operating system for all hardware platforms. public clusters consisted of Sun SPARC and SGI Indy workstations. SGI hardware was dropped in anticipation of the end of IRIX production in 2006. Linux-Athena was introduced in version 9, with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system running on cheaper x86 or x86-64 hardware. Athena 9 also replaced the internally developed &quot;DASH&quot; menu system and Motif Window Manager (mwm) with a more modern GNOME desktop. Athena 10 is based on Ubuntu Linux (derived from Debian) only. Support for Solaris is expected to be dropped almost entirely.

== Educational software ==
&quot;I felt that, we would know Athena was successful, if we were surprised by some of the applications, it turned out that our surprises were largely in the humanities&quot; — Joel Moses&lt;ref name=&quot;news.mit.edu/2018/1111&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The original concept of Project Athena was that there would be course-specific software developed to use in conjunction with teaching. Today, computers are most frequently used for &quot;horizontal&quot; applications such as e-mail, word processing, communications, and graphics.

The big impact of Athena on education has been the integration of third party applications into courses. Maple, and especially, MATLAB, are integrated into large numbers of science and engineering classes. Faculty expect that their students have access to, and know how to use, these applications for projects, and homework assignments, and some have used the MATLAB platform to rebuild the courseware that they had originally built using the X Window System.

More specialized third-party software are used on Athena for more discipline-specific work. Rendering software, for architecture and computer graphics classes, molecular modeling software, for chemistry, chemical engineering, and material science courses, and professional software used by chemical engineers in industry, are important components of a number of MIT classes in various departments.

== Contributing to the development of distributed systems ==
Athena was not a research project, and the development of new models of computing was not a primary objective of the project. Indeed, quite the opposite was true. MIT wanted a high-quality computing environment for education. The only apparent way to obtain one was to build it internally, using existing components where available, and augmenting those components with software to create the desired distributed system. However, the fact that this was a leading edge development in an area of intense interest to the computing industry worked strongly to the favor of MIT by attracting large amounts of funding from industrial sources.

Long experience has shown that advanced development directed at solving important problems tends to be much more successful than advanced development promoting technology that must look for a problem to solve. Athena is an excellent example of advanced development undertaken to meet a need that was both immediate and important. The need to solve a &quot;real&quot; problem kept Athena on track to focus on important issues and solve them, and to avoid getting side-tracked into academically interesting but relatively unimportant problems. Consequently, Athena made very significant contributions to the technology of distributed computing, but as a side-effect to solving an educational problem.

The leading edge system architecture and design features pioneered by Athena, using current terminology, include:
* Client–server model of distributed computing using three-tier architecture (see Multitier architecture)
* Thin client (stateless) desktops
* System-wide security system (Kerberos encrypted authentication and authorization)
* Naming service (Hesiod)
* X Window System, widely used within the Unix community
* X tool kit for easy construction of human interfaces
* Instant messaging (Zephyr real time notification service)
* System-wide use of a directory system
* Integrated system-wide maintenance system (Moira Service Management System)
* On-Line Help system (OLH)
* Public bulletin board system (Discuss)

Many of the design concepts developed in the &quot;on-line consultant&quot; now appear in popular help desk software packages.

Because the functional and system management benefits provided by the Athena system were not available in any other system, its use extended beyond the MIT campus. In keeping with the established policy of MIT, the software was made available at no cost to all interested parties. Digital Equipment Corporation, having implemented Athena at various beta-test sites, &quot;productized&quot; the software as DECAthena to make it more portable, and offered it along with support services to the market. A number of academic and industrial organizations installed the Athena software. As of early 1992, 20 universities worldwide were using DECathena, with a reported 30 commercial organisations evaluating the product.

The architecture of the system also found use beyond MIT. The architecture of the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) software from the Open Software Foundation was based on concepts pioneered by Athena. Subsequently, the Windows NT network operating system from Microsoft incorporates Kerberos and several other basic architecture design features first implemented by Athena.

== Use outside MIT ==
* Pixar Animation Studios, the computer graphics and animation company (then the Lucasfilm Computer Graphics Project, now owned by Walt Disney Pictures), used ten VAX-11/750 superminicomputers at &quot;Project Athena&quot;, for some of the rendering of &quot;The Adventures of André and Wally B.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=c5WZDgAAQBAJ&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory/Animation-1984-1985&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Iowa State University runs an implementation of Athena named &quot;Project Vincent&quot;, named after John Vincent Atanasoff, the inventor of the Atanasoff–Berry Computer.
* North Carolina State University also runs a variation of Athena named &quot;Eos/Unity&quot;.
* Carnegie Mellon University began a similar system a year earlier than MIT called Project Andrew which spawned AFS, Athena&#x27;s current filesystem.
* University of Maryland, College Park also ran a variation of Athena on the WAM (Workstations at Maryland) and Glue, now renamed &#x27;&quot;TerpConnect&quot;.

<doc id="447291" wikidata="Q7628127" url="?curid=447291" title="Studio 2">
<text>Studio 2 was a daily (weeknights) current affairs newsmagazine on TVOntario in Ontario, Canada. The show won several Gemini Awards, and was hosted by Steve Paikin and Paula Todd (who replaced original co-host Mary Hynes in the show&#x27;s third season), and first aired in 1994.

TVOntario announced the program&#x27;s termination on June 29, 2006. The final episode aired on June 30, and was replaced that fall with a new series hosted by Paikin, &quot;The Agenda&quot;.

Rather than a newscast style, &quot;Studio 2&quot; tackled certain current news stories affecting many Canadians with a focus often on Ontario. Regular topics on the show included healthcare, federal politics, provincial politics, terrorism, foreign affairs, the environment, the arts and many others. The show usually performed a deep analysis, often with open discussions among experts or even interviewing specific figures involved in the issues. Also included were arts and current affairs documentary segments, live performance, and in-depth personal interviews.

The show was partially integrated with two other TVOntario series hosted by Paikin, &quot;Fourth Reading&quot; and &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot;, which used the same studio and production team and aired immediately after &quot;Studio 2&quot; on their respective nights, but were treated and billed as separate series rather than segments of &quot;Studio 2&quot;. &quot;Fourth Reading&quot; had already been in production for two years before &quot;Studio 2&quot; premiered, while &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot; began as a segment on &quot;Studio 2&quot; before being spun off into its own series in 1998. However, when &quot;Studio 2&quot; was replaced with &quot;The Agenda&quot;, the new program fully subsumed both &quot;Fourth Reading&quot; and &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot; as well.
