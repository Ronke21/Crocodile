<text>The Border Security Force (BSF) is a central armed police force in India under the Ministry of Home Affairs. It is responsible for guarding India’s borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh. It was formed in the wake of the Indo-Pak War of 1965 to ensure the security of India’s borders and for related matters.

The BSF has grown from 25 battalions in 1965, to 193 battalions with a sanctioned strength of 270,000 personnel including an expanding air wing, water wing, an artillery regiment and specialised units. It is currently the world&#x27;s largest border security force. BSF has been termed the &quot;First Line of Defence&quot; of Indian territories.

== History ==
Since India&#x27;s independence in 1947, the protection of its international boundaries was the responsibility of the local police in each border state, with little inter-state coordination. However, during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Pakistan attacked Sardar Post, Char Bet, and Beria Bet on April 9, 1965, in Kutch. This attack exposed the inadequacy of the State Armed Police in coping with armed aggression. Thus, after the war, the government created the Border Security Force as a unified central agency with the specific mandate of guarding India&#x27;s international borders. This act brought greater cohesion to border security. K F Rustamji, from the Indian Police Service, was the first Director General of the BSF. Since it was a new force, the officers had to be deputed or inducted from outside to fill the various vacancies at different levels until the force&#x27;s own cadre matured sufficiently. For this reason, emergency commissioned officers and SS officers of the Indian Army were inducted in large numbers into the force, along with IPS officers who were deputed to the force for high-level appointments.

The BSF&#x27;s capabilities were used in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 against Pakistani forces in areas where the Regular Forces were thinly spread. BSF troops took part in several operations, including the famous Battle of Longewala. In fact, for the BSF the war on the eastern front had started well before the war actually broke out in December 1971. BSF had trained, supported and formed part of Mukti Bahini and had entered erstwhile East Pakistan before the actual hostilities broke out. The BSF played a very important role in the Liberation of Bangladesh, which Indira Gandhi and Sheikh Mujibur Rehman had also acknowledged.

=== List of Directors General of the BSF ===
K.F. Rustamji, IPS, was appointed as the first Director General of Border Security Force from July 22, 1965, to September 30, 1972, and the current DG (additional charge) is Daljit Singh Chaudhary, IPS, since August 3, 2024.
=== Engagements ===
*Indo-Pakistani War of 1971
*Operation Blue Star
*Operation Black Thunder
*Insurgency in Punjab 
*Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir
*Operation Vijay – Kargil War
*2001 Bangladeshi-Indian border skirmishes
*2001–2002 Operation Parakram – India-Pakistan Standoff
*2013 India-Pakistan Border skirmishes
*2014–15 India–Pakistan border skirmishes
*2016–2018 India–Pakistan border skirmishes
*2019 India–Pakistan border skirmishes

== Roles ==
During peacetime
* Border guarding and security.
* Prevention of trans-border crimes, unauthorized entry into or exit from the territory of India.
* Prevention of smuggling and any other illegal activities on the border.
* Anti-infiltration duties.
* Collection of trans-border intelligence.
* To promote a sense of security among the people living in the border areas.

During war time
* Holding ground in assigned sectors.
* Limited aggressive action against irregular forces of the enemy. 
* Maintenance of law and order in enemy territory administered under the Army&#x27;s control.
* Acting as guides to the Army in border areas.
* Assistance in control of refugees.
* Provision of escorts.
* Performing special tasks connected with intelligence including cross-border raids.
* Replenishing manpower.

The BSF is also employed for internal security duties and other law and order duties on the requisition of the State Government. Being a Central Armed Police Force, it can be entrusted with policing duties at any place apart from its mandate. Although originally charged with guarding India&#x27;s external boundaries, the BSF in the 1990s was also given the task of counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and the Northeastern Seven Sister States. While in Punjab, the BSF took part in operations like Blue Star, Black Thunder 1 &amp; 2. However, when the insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir broke out in 1989, it moved towards the state and handed over the operations in Punjab to CRPF and local police. In Jammu and Kashmir, the state police and the thinly-deployed Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) struggled to cope with the torturous violence, so it was deployed to combat these.

In Jammu and Kashmir, the BSF initially suffered casualties from terrorist attacks but later saw successes. During the initial years, terrorist activity had even reached Jammu and parts of Northern Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. However, it was only due to the successful operations by BSF that by the late 1990s, their area of activity had been restricted only to the valley. 
BSF was also successful in setting up a robust HUMINT network. From arresting Maulana Masood Azhar, Bitta Karate, Yasin Malik, the BSF is also credited for killing Ghazi Baba - the chief of Jaish-e-Mohammed and the mastermind of the 2001 Indian Parliament attack in August 2003, along with his deputy commander. The BSF raided Baba&#x27;s hideout in Srinagar, and he was killed in the ensuing gun battle along with his deputy chief.

However, with changing tactical and operational conditions, and expansion and modernisation of State police, the Government withdrew all 60 BSF battalions and redeployed them on the Indo-Pakistani border and Bangladesh–India border. These troops were then replaced by fresh troops from the CRPF that had undergone specialised training in counter-terrorism.

Some units of the BSF are also deployed in Central India to combat Naxal violence. Counter-Maoist operations are diversified. BSF is deployed in Kanker district of Chhattisgarh, where Naxal strength is comparatively thinner than that of other parts of Bastar region. At present total 15 battalions of BSF are stationed in different parts of Kanker district to combat the Naxal.

After recent civilian killings in Kashmir the Home Ministry re-inducted the BSF for counter-insurgency operations and law-and-order duties in valley. The BSF units will be deployed in sensitive areas which lie in various districts of the Kashmir valley. A significant contributor to BSF success in the Kashmir Valley is Commandant Jagmohan Singh Rawat SM, KC. He has played a crucial role in counter-insurgency operations.

== Organisation ==

The Border Security Force has its headquarters in New Delhi and is known as Force Headquarters (FHQ) headed by a director general. Various directorates like Operations, Communications &amp; IT, Training, Engineering, General, Law, Provisioning, Administration, Personnel, Armaments, Medical, Finance etc. function under the DG. Each directorate is headed by an IG. The Eastern Theatre is looked after by Spl. DG HQ (Eastern Command) at Kolkata and the Western Theatre is looked after by Spl DG HQ (Western Command) at Chandigarh. Field Formations in BSF are headed by an Inspector General (IG) and are known as Frontiers Headquarters (Ftr HQ). There is 13 such Frontier under which Sector Headquarters (SHQ) function headed by a Deputy Inspector General (DIG) each. Each SHQ has under its command, 4–5 infantry battalions, along with attachments of artillery, air and water wings. Presently 186 battalions are sanctioned to BSF. Five major training institutions and ten Subsidiary Training Centres (STCs) are imparting ab-initio as well as in-service training to its ranks and other CPOs/SPOs including IPS Probationers.

BSF is the only Central Armed Police Force to have its own Air Wing and artillery regiment, and besides ITBP to have a Water Wing. All these specialised wings support the General Duty Battalions in their operations. The Financial Adviser of the BSF has been an Indian Revenue Service officer of the rank of Joint Secretary and also has Dy Advisers from the Indian Audit and Accounts Service, Indian Civil Account Service and Indian Defence Account Service.

The BSF also has a national level school for the breeding and training of dogs. Dogs from other CPOs and State Police are sent to National Training Centre for Dogs (NTCD) to be trained in infantry patrol, detection of explosives, tracking and the like.

The BSF maintains a Tear Smoke Unit (TSU), which is unique in India. The TSU is responsible for producing tear gas munitions required for the Anti-Riot Forces. It also exports a substantial quantity to other countries.

Three battalions of the BSF, located at Kolkata, Guwahati, and Patna, are designated as the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Each battalion maintains 18 self-contained specialist search and rescue teams of 45 personnel each, including engineers, technicians, electricians, dog squads and medics and paramedics. The establishment of each battalion is 1,158 personnel. The NDRF is a multi-disciplinary, multi-skilled, high-tech force for all types of disasters and can deploy to disasters by air, sea, and land. These battalions are equipped and trained for all natural disasters including combating Chemical, Biological Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) disasters.

Since 2014, as a part of modernisation, BSF also started installing infra-red, thermal imagers, aerostats for aerial surveillance, ground sensors, radars, sonar systems to secure riverine borders, fibre-optic sensor and laser beam intrusion detection systems on specific sections of border with Pakistan and Bangladesh. These Hi-tech systems are installed in areas where barbed wire fencing could not be installed due to treacherous terrain or marshy riverine topography. The largest section of this system is located at Dhubri, Assam, where Brahmaputra river enters Bangladesh.

In 2010, some Canadian visa officials rejected the immigration application of a retired BSF soldier Fateh Singh Pandher, terming BSF a &quot;notoriously violent paramilitary unit engaged in systematic attacks on civilians and responsible for torturing suspected criminals.&quot; This accusation did not go down well with the Indian government. The Indian External Affairs Ministry was asked by the Home minister to take up the issue with Canada. The Home ministry of India, as well as the Indian public in general and several of India&#x27;s political parties, expressed outrage at this attack and called Canada&#x27;s actions discriminatory and spurious, and denounced their charges against the BSF as baseless and unproven. The Indian government threatened diplomatic retaliation unless Canada withdrew their allegations. The Canadian government did not respond immediately. It was speculated that diplomatic retaliation from India will consist of banning Canadians going to participate the War in Afghanistan if they are doing so through India. Public outrage in India prompted Canadian authorities to express &quot;great respect for India&#x27;s armed forces and related institutions.&quot; Subsequently, India&#x27;s Ministry of External Affairs summoned Canadian High Commissioner Joseph Caron and demanded that &quot;the blatant discrimination against Indian security agencies&quot; cease. India&#x27;s Minister of External Affairs, SM Krishna, condemned Canada&#x27;s actions and has expressed pride in the accomplishments of the BSF.

Following complaints made by the Indian government and criticism of Canada&#x27;s actions against India, the Harper government retracted their earlier accusations against BSF security officials. Canada&#x27;s Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Jason Kenney, termed as &quot;unfortunate&quot; the incidents involving use of &quot;foul language by the Canadian High Commission in visa rejection letters to some individuals,&quot; Kenney said, &quot;This language, or the inaccurate impression it has created, in no way reflects the policy or position of the Government of Canada.&quot;

=== Bangladesh border killings ===
According to the Bangladeshi government, 136 civilians were killed and a further 170 others suffered injuries in 2009. The Indian government has said that 67 were killed and 80 injured in 2009. The Bangladesh government and Bangladeshi organizations protested heavily against these alleged killings. Media reports claim that in August 2008, Indian BSF officials admitted that they killed 59 persons (34 Bangladeshis, 21 Indians, rest unidentified) who were trying to cross the border illegally during the prior six months. Indian media claimed that, in 2001, Bangladesh Rifles ambushed and killed 16 BSF soldiers while they were chasing some Bangladeshi smugglers back into the Bangladesh. Since then, the BSF has been compelled to act tough against Bangladeshi illegals. There was perceived retaliation by the BSF but was averted after Home Ministers of both countries had talks on the issue.

In July 2009 Channel 4 News reported that apparently &quot;hundreds&quot; of Bangladeshis and Indians are indiscriminately killed by the BSF along the Indo-Bangladeshi Barrier. The BSF claims that the barrier&#x27;s main purpose is to check illegal immigration to India, and prevent cross-border terrorism from Islamists.

Bangladeshi media accused the BSF of abducting 5 Bangladeshi children, aged between 8 and 15, from the Haripur Upazila in Thakurgaon District of Bangladesh, in 2010. The children were setting fishing nets near the border.

In 2010, Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued an 81-page report which alleged &quot;over 900 of abuses by the BSF&quot; in the first decade of the 21st century. The report was compiled from interviews with victims of BSF shootings, witnesses and members of the BSF and its Bangladeshi counterpart. According to HRW, while most of them were killed when they crossed into Indian territory for indulging in cattle raiding or other smuggling activities.

In February 2012, the BSF website was hacked by Bangladeshi hackers in retaliation. The hackers later shared the news in the internet and also in the other social sites where they claimed to have defaced the sites asking the BSF to stop killing Bangladeshis at border. The site became normal sometime on 15 February 2012.

== Challenges ==
=== Working conditions ===
Working conditions of the BSF have been questioned. &quot;Zero Error Syndrome&quot; adds stress. A home ministry standing committee report on the &quot;Working Conditions in Border Guarding Forces&quot; was published in December 2018, it was chaired by P. Chidambaram.

=== Health ===
Health of employees remains a challenge, and given the numbers of the force, more employees, as compared to operational deaths, die of diseases, illness; and mental health issues have also been raised and addressed by the force.

<text>360 (three hundred [and] sixty) is the natural number following 359 and preceding 361.

==In mathematics==

* 360 is the 13th highly composite number and one of only seven numbers such that no number less than twice as much has more divisors; the others are 1, 2, 6, 12, 60, and 2520 .

*360 is also the 6th superior highly composite number, the 6th colossally abundant number, a refactorable number, a 5-smooth number, and a Harshad number in decimal since the sum of its digits (9) is a divisor of 360.

*360 is divisible by the number of its divisors (24), and it is the smallest number divisible by every natural number from 1 to 10, except 7. Furthermore, one of the divisors of 360 is 72, which is the number of primes below it.

*360 is the sum of twin primes (179 + 181) and the sum of four consecutive powers of three (9 + 27 + 81 + 243). 

*The sum of Euler&#x27;s totient function φ(x) over the first thirty-four integers is 360.

*360 is a triangular matchstick number.

*360 is the product of the first two unitary perfect numbers: formula_1

*There are 360 even permutations of 6 elements. They form the alternating group A6.

A turn is divided into 360 degrees for angular measurement. is also called a round angle. This unit choice divides round angles into equal sectors measured in integer rather than fractional degrees. Many angles commonly appearing in planimetrics have an integer number of degrees. For a simple non-intersecting polygon, the sum of the internal angles of a quadrilateral always equals 360 degrees.

<text>The 1865 United Kingdom general election was held 7 July 1865 to 24 July 1865 to elect 658 members of the House of Commons. It saw the Liberals, led by Lord Palmerston, increase their large majority over the Earl of Derby&#x27;s Conservatives to 80.

Palmerston died in October the same year and was succeeded by Lord John Russell as Prime Minister. Despite the Liberal majority, the party was divided by the issue of further parliamentary reform, and Russell resigned after being defeated in a vote in the House of Commons in 1866, leading to minority Conservative governments under Derby and then Benjamin Disraeli.

This was the last United Kingdom general election until 2019 where a party increased its majority after having been returned to office at the previous election with a reduced majority.
==Corruption==
The 1865 general election was regarded by contemporaries as being a generally dull contest nationally, which exaggerated the degree of corruption within individual constituencies. In his PhD thesis, Cornelius O&#x27;Leary described &quot;The Times&quot; as having reported &quot;the testimony is unanimous that in the General Election of 1865 there was more profuse and corrupt expenditure than was ever known before&quot;. As a result of allegations of corruption, 50 election petitions were lodged, of which 35 were pressed to a trial; 13 ended with the elected MP being unseated. In four cases a Royal Commission had to be appointed because of widespread corrupt practices in the constituency.

As a result, when he became Prime Minister in 1867, Benjamin Disraeli announced that he would introduce a new method for election petition trials, which were then determined by a committee of the House of Commons, resulting in the Parliamentary Elections Act 1868, whereby two Judges of the Court of Common Pleas, Exchequer of Pleas or Queen&#x27;s Bench would be designated to try election petitions with full judicial salaries.

== Constituencies ==
Many new constituencies were used for this election:

* Northern West Riding of Yorkshire
* Southern West Riding of Yorkshire

<doc id="446838" wikidata="Q333452" url="?curid=446838" title="Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg">
<text>Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg PC FRS (26 October 1778 – 23 April 1866) was a Scottish politician and colonial administrator who served as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies

==Background and education==
Grant was born in Kidderpore, Bengal Presidency, British India, the eldest son of Charles Grant, chairman of the directors of the British East India Company. His brother, Sir Robert Grant, was also an MP as well as Governor of Bombay. He was educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and became a fellow in 1802. He was called to the bar in 1807.

==Political career==
In 1811 Grant was elected to the British House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Inverness Burghs. He held that seat until 1818, when he was returned for Inverness-shire. He was a Lord of the Treasury from December 1813 until August 1819, when he became Chief Secretary for Ireland and a Privy Counsellor. In 1823 he was appointed Vice-President of the Board of Trade; from September 1827 to June 1828 he was President of the Board of Trade and Treasurer of the Navy.

Grant broke with the Tories over Reform and joined the Whigs (via the Canningite Tory splinter group). He was President of the Board of Control under Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne from November 1830 to November 1834. At the Board of Control Grant was primarily responsible for the Government of India Act 1833 that altered the constitution of the Government of India. In April 1835 he became Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, and was created Baron Glenelg, of Glenelg in the County of Inverness. His term of office was a stormy one. His differences with Sir Benjamin d&#x27;Urban, Governor of Cape Colony, were serious; but more so were those with King William IV and others over the administration of Canada. Lord Glenelg was still Secretary when the Canadian rebellion broke out in 1837; his policy was fiercely attacked in Parliament; he became involved in disputes with Lord Durham, and the movement for his supersession found supporters even among his colleagues in the cabinet. In February 1839 Lord Glenelg resigned. He has been called the last of the Canningites.

==Personal life==
Lord Glenelg died in Cannes, France in April 1866, aged 87. The barony became extinct on his death.

==Legacy==
A ship, the &quot;Lord Glenelg&quot; was named after him which voyaged from Britain to Australia in 1841.

<text>The 1859 United Kingdom general election was held from 28 April to 18 May 1859 following the defeat of Prime Minister the Earl of Derby&#x27;s Conservative government in a vote of confidence. The newly formed Liberal Party, led by Viscount Palmerston, secured victory despite winning fewer seats than in the previous election.

There is no separate tally of votes or seats for the Peelites. They did not contest elections as an organised party but more as independent Free trade Conservatives with varying degrees of distance from the two main parties.

It was also the last general election entered by the Chartists, before their organisation was dissolved. , this is the last election in which the Conservatives won the most seats in Wales.

The election was the quietest and least competitive between 1832 and 1885, with most county elections being uncontested. The election also saw the lowest number of candidates between 1832 and 1885, with Tory gains potentially being the result of a lack of opposition as much as a change in public opinion.
According to A. J. P. Taylor:
: the government which Palmerston organized in June 1859 was a coalition of a different kind: not a coalition of groups which looked back to the past, but a coalition which anticipated the future. Had it not been for Palmerston himself—too individual, too full of personality to be fitted into a party-pattern—it would have been the first Liberal government in our history. Everything that was important in it was Liberal—finance, administrative reform, its very composition: the first government with unmistakable middle-class Free Traders as members.

==History==

In the days before the Spanish conquest of Yucatán, Tizimin municipality was a part of the province of Cupules.

1542 The Spanish captain Sebastian Burgos, with his companion Francisco de Montejo (a Nephew), conquered the territory.

1543 The town of Valladolid is founded on the banks of the lagoon Chouac-Ha. (it is important to note here that the Chouac-Ha lagoon, which was the original location of the now city of Valladolid, now belongs to the municipality of Tizimin. While Valladolid was founded in here, it was later abandoned as the residents had too many problems with mosquitoes and humidity. As the site is part of the municipality of Tizimin, the fact that this historical event that occurred in the municipality is highlighted as part of its history.

1549 Tizimin was a land parcel owned by Captain Sebastian de Burgos.

1824 The State Congress decrees the reestablishment of Indian republics. Tizimin was one of those republics.

1835 A conservative unitary system of government was instituted in Mexico (a centralized dictatorship unconstitutionally brought forth and held by the then-President: Santa Anna. Yucatán became a department, and authority was imposed from the center.

1838 Discontent increased and an insurrection erupted in Tizimín in May, advocating Yucatecan independence.

1870 This year the parish priest of the village of Tizimin, Manuel Luciano Perez, sends a rare manuscript that has been called Chilam Balam of Tizimin to the Bishop of Yucatán, Crescendo Carrillo y Ancona, with the remark that it has been in his possession for a number of years. It is now preserved in the National Museum of Anthropology and History in Mexico City.

1913 On November 30 the inauguration of the railway from Espita-Tizimin, on this day the first locomotive arrives at the station in Tizimin.

1943 On May 29 start of the fourth centenary celebrations of the founding of Valladolid, in the Chouac-Ha (in this place was founded the city of Valladolid on the site that belongs to the municipality of Tizimin).

1975 For the first time in the history of Yucatán, a European monarch comes to visit Tizimin and its people. On February 28 Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom of Great Britain formally inaugurated the zoo and botanical garden at Tizimin. Queen Elizabeth II also visited Uxmal and until recently the chain that was added so that she could climb the temple of the magician was still in place.

<doc id="446843" wikidata="Q1484503" url="?curid=446843" title="Herding">
<text>Herding is the act of bringing individual animals together into a group (herd), maintaining the group, and moving the group from place to place—or any combination of those. Herding can refer either to the process of animals forming herds in the wild, or to human intervention forming herds for some purpose. While the layperson uses the term &quot;herding&quot; to describe this human intervention, most individuals involved in the process term it mustering, &quot;working stock&quot;, or droving.

Some animals instinctively gather together as a herd. A group of animals fleeing a predator will demonstrate herd behavior for protection; while some predators, such as wolves and dogs have instinctive herding abilities derived from primitive hunting instincts. Instincts in herding dogs and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Dogs exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to aid in herding and to compete in herding and stock dog trials. Sperm whales have also been observed teaming up to herd prey in a coordinated feeding behavior. People use dogs to help herd.

Herding is used in agriculture to manage domesticated animals. Herding can be performed by people or trained animals such as herding dogs that control the movement of livestock under the direction of a person. The people whose occupation it is to herd or control animals often have &quot;herd&quot; added to the name of the animal they are &quot;herding&quot; to describe their occupation (shepherd, goatherd, cowherd). Many people use dogs to help herd animals Most herbivores live in groups, called herds, they go from place to place grazing the grassland. There are special maps that show where big groups of these animal herders range from the US to Canada. Herding began over 10,000 years ago, as prehistoric hunters domesticated different animals.

A competitive sport has developed in some countries where the combined skill of man and herding dog is tested and judged in a &quot;trial&quot;, such as a sheepdog trial. Animals such as sheep, camel, yak, and goats are mostly reared. They provide milk, meat and other products to the herders and their families.

<doc id="446844" wikidata="Q156895" url="?curid=446844" title="Betula pendula">
<text>Betula pendula, commonly known as silver birch, warty birch, European white birch, or East Asian white birch, is a species of tree in the family Betulaceae, native to Europe and parts of Asia, though in southern Europe, it is only found at higher altitudes. Its range extends into Siberia, China, and southwest Asia in the mountains of northern Turkey, the Caucasus, and northern Iran. It has been introduced into North America, where it is known as the European white birch or weeping birch and is considered invasive in some states in the United States and parts of Canada. The tree can also be found in more temperate regions of Australia.

The silver birch is a medium-sized deciduous tree that owes its common name to the white peeling bark on the trunk. The twigs are slender and often pendulous and the leaves are roughly triangular with doubly serrate margins and turn yellow and brown in autumn before they fall. The flowers are catkins and the light, winged seeds get widely scattered by the wind. The silver birch is a hardy tree, a pioneer species, and one of the first trees to appear on bare or fire-swept land. Many species of birds and animals are found in birch woodland, the tree supports a wide range of insects and the light shade it casts allows shrubby and other plants to grow beneath its canopy. It is planted decoratively in parks and gardens and is used for forest products such as joinery timber, firewood, tanning, racecourse jumps, and brooms. Various parts of the tree are used in traditional medicine and the bark contains triterpenes, which have been shown to have medicinal properties.

==Description==
The silver birch typically reaches tall (exceptionally up to ), with a slender trunk usually under diameter. The bark on the trunk and branches is golden-brown at first, but later this turns to white as a result of papery tissue developing on the surface and peeling off in flakes, in a similar manner to the closely related paper birch (&quot;B. papyrifera&quot;). The bark remains smooth until the tree gets quite large, but in older trees, the bark thickens, becoming irregular, dark, and rugged. Young branches have whitish resin warts and the twigs are slender, hairless, and often . The buds are small and sticky, and development is sympodial – the terminal bud dies away and growth continues from a lateral bud. The species is monoecious with male and female catkins found on the same tree. Some shoots are long and bear the male catkins at the tip, while others are short and bear female catkins. The immature male catkins are present during the winter, but the female catkins develop in the spring, soon after the leaves unfurl.

The leaves have short, slender stalks and are long, triangular with broad, untoothed, wedge-shaped bases, slender pointed tips, and coarsely double-toothed, serrated margins. They are sticky with resin at first, but this dries as they age, leaving small, white scales. The foliage is a pale to medium green and turns yellow early in the autumn before the leaves fall. In midsummer, the female catkins mature and the male catkins expand and release pollen, and wind pollination takes place. A catkin of Silver birch could produce an average of 1.66 million pollen grains. The small, 1- to 2-mm winged seeds ripen in late summer on pendulous, cylindrical catkins long and broad. The seeds are very numerous and are separated by scales, and when ripe, the whole catkin disintegrates and the seeds are spread widely by the wind.

Silver birch can easily be confused with the similar downy birch (&quot;Betula pubescens&quot;). Yet, downy birches are characterised by hairy leaves and young shoots, whereas the same parts on silver birch are hairless. The leaf base of silver birch is usually a right angle to the stalk, while for downy birches, it is rounded. In terms of genetic structure, the trees are quite different, but do, however, occasionally hybridize.
==Distribution and habitat==
The silver birch grows naturally from western Europe eastwards to Kazakhstan, the Sakha Republic in Siberia, Mongolia, and the Xinjiang province in China, and southwards to the mountains of the Caucasus and northern Iran, Iraq, and Turkey. It is also native to northern Morocco and has become naturalised in some other parts of the world. In the southern parts of its range, it is mainly found in mountainous regions. Its light seeds are easily blown by the wind and it is a pioneer species, one of the first trees to sprout on bare land or after a forest fire. It needs plenty of light and does best on dry, acid soils and is found on heathland, mountainsides, and clinging to crags. Its tolerance to pollution make it suitable for planting in industrial areas and exposed sites. It has been introduced into North America, where it is known as the European white birch, and is considered invasive in the states of Kentucky, Maryland, Washington, and Wisconsin. It is naturalised and locally invasive in parts of Canada.

==Taxonomy==

Three subspecies of silver birch are accepted:
* &quot;Betula pendula&quot; subsp. &quot;pendula&quot; – Europe and eastwards to central Asia
* &quot;Betula pendula&quot; subsp. &quot;mandshurica&quot; – eastern Asia and western North America; treated by some botanists as &quot;Betula platyphylla&quot;
* &quot;Betula pendula&quot; subsp. &quot;szechuanica&quot; – western China, from Qinghai and Gansu to Yunnan and southeast Xizang (Tibet), treated by some botanists as &quot;Betula szechuanica&quot;

&quot;B. pendula&quot; is distinguished from the related &quot;B. pubescens&quot;, the other common European birch, in having hairless, warty shoots (hairy and without warts in downy birch), more triangular leaves with double serration on the margins (more ovoid and with single serrations in downy birch), and whiter bark often with scattered black fissures (greyer, less fissured, in downy birch). It is also distinguished cytologically, silver birch being diploid (with two sets of chromosomes), whereas downy birch is tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes). Hybrids between the two are known, but are very rare, and being triploid, are sterile. The two have differences in habitat requirements, with silver birch found mainly on dry, sandy soils, and downy birch more common on wet, poorly drained sites such as clay soils and peat bogs. Silver birch also demands slightly more summer warmth than does downy birch, which is significant in the cooler parts of Europe. Many North American texts treat the two species as conspecific (and cause confusion by combining the downy birch&#x27;s alternative vernacular name &#x27;white birch&#x27;, with the scientific name &quot;B. pendula&quot; of the other species), but they are regarded as distinct species throughout Europe.

Several varieties of &quot;B. pendula&quot; are no longer accepted, including &quot;B. pendula&quot; var. &quot;carelica&quot;, &quot;fontqueri&quot;, &quot;laciniata&quot;, &quot;lapponica&quot;, &quot;meridionalis&quot;, &quot;microlepis&quot;, and &quot;parvibracteata&quot;, as well as forms &quot;Betula pendula&quot; f. &quot;bircalensis&quot;, &quot;crispa&quot;, and &quot;palmeri&quot;. Other synonyms include: 
==Ecology==
The silver birch has an open canopy which allows plenty of light to reach the ground. This allows a variety of mosses, grasses, and flowering plants to grow beneath, which in turn attract insects. Flowering plants often found in birch woods include primrose (&quot;Primula vulgaris&quot;), violet (&quot;Viola riviniana&quot;), bluebell (&quot;Hyacinthoides non-scripta&quot;), wood anemone (&quot;Anemone nemorosa&quot;), and wood sorrel (&quot;Oxalis acetosella&quot;). Small shrubs that grow on the forest floor include blaeberry (&quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot;) and cowberry (&quot;Vaccinium vitis-idaea&quot;).
Birds found in birch woodland include the chaffinch, tree pipit, willow warbler, nightingale, robin, woodcock, redpoll, and green woodpecker.

The branches of the silver birch often have tangled masses of twigs known as witch&#x27;s brooms growing among them, caused by the fungus &quot;Taphrina betulina&quot;. Old trees are often killed by the decay fungus &quot;Fomitopsis betulina&quot; and fallen branches rot rapidly on the forest floor. This tree commonly grows with the mycorrhizal fungus &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; in a mutualistic relationship. This applies particularly to acidic or nutrient-poor soils. Other mycorrhizal associates include &quot;Leccinum scabrum&quot; and &quot;Cantharellus cibarius&quot;. In addition to mycorrhiza, the presence of microfauna in the soil assists the growth of the tree, as it enhances the mobilization of nutrients.
The larvae of a large number of species of butterflies, moths, and other insects feed on the leaves and other parts of the silver birch. In Germany, almost 500 species of insects have been found on silver and downy birch including 106 beetles and 105 lepidopterans, with 133 insect species feeding almost exclusively on birch. Birch dieback disease can affect planted trees, while naturally regenerated trees seem less susceptible. This disease also affects &quot;B. pubescens&quot; and in 2000 was reported at many of the sites planted with birch in Scotland during the 1990s. In the United States, the wood is attacked by the bronze birch borer (&quot;Agrilus anxius&quot;), an insect pest to which it has no natural resistance.

==Conservation==
&quot;Betula pendula&quot; is considered a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List. The synonym &quot;Betula oycowiensis&quot; (as &quot;B. oycoviensis&quot;) was previously listed on the Red List as vulnerable, though it is now considered a synonym of &quot;B. pendula&quot; subsp. &quot;pendula&quot;. &quot;B. szaferi&quot; was previously considered extinct in the wild on the Red List, but is now considered a form of &quot;B. pendula&quot; with the presence of a mutant gene, causing it to grow weakly and fruit heavily.

==Uses==


The silver birch is Finland&#x27;s national tree. Leafy, fragrant bunches of young silver birch boughs (called &quot;vihta&quot; or &quot;vasta&quot;) are used to gently beat oneself while bathing in the Finnish sauna. Silver birch is often planted in parks and gardens, grown for its white bark and gracefully drooping shoots, sometimes even in warmer-than-optimum places such as Los Angeles and Sydney. In Scandinavia and other regions of northern Europe, it is grown for forest products such as lumber and pulp, as well as for aesthetic purposes and ecosystem services. It is sometimes used as a pioneer and nurse tree elsewhere.

Silver birch wood is pale in colour with a light reddish-brown heartwood and is used in making furniture, plywood, veneers, parquet blocks, skis, and kitchen utensils, and in turnery. It makes a good firewood, but is quickly consumed by the flames. Slabs of bark are used for making roof shingles and strips are used for handicrafts such as bast shoes and small containers. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the resin collected; the resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires. The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires. The removal of bark was at one time so widespread that Carl Linnaeus expressed his concern for the survival of the woodlands.

Birch brushwood is used for racecourse jumps and besom brooms. In the spring, large quantities of sap rise up the trunk and this can be tapped. It contains around 1% sugars and can be used in a similar way to maple syrup, being drunk fresh, concentrated by evaporation, or fermented into a &quot;wine&quot;.

===Phytochemicals===
The outer part of the bark contains up to 20% betulin. The main components in the essential oil of the buds are α-copaene (~10%), germacrene D (~15%), and δ-cadinene (~13%). Also present in the bark are other triterpene substances which have been used in laboratory research to identify its possible biological properties.

=== Medical uses ===

Standardized allergen extract, white birch, sold under the brand name Itulatek, is indicated for the treatment of allergy to tree pollen from birch, alder and/or hazel and have allergic rhinitis (with or without conjunctivitis).

The combination of &quot;Betula pendula&quot;/&quot;Betula pubescens&quot; is used to treat epidermolysis bullosa. The combination of these is also used to make Episalvan gel, which is used to treat wounds in upper layers of the skin.

Leaf extracts of &quot;Betula pendula&quot; have been used to treat both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. The extracts inhibit cell growth and cell division of the activated T lymphocytes by inducing apoptosis in the cell. This causes a decrease in inflammation caused by arthritis.

Betula pendula and Betula pubescens have the potential to treat cancer because of anti-carcinogenic properties. These buds contain stantin and cirsimaritin. Santin is a flavonol that expresses anti-inflammatory characteristics, which suppresses genes associated with cancer. Both santin and cirsimaritin induce apoptosis of cancer cells. &quot;Betula pendula&quot; bark extracts inhibit growth of in vitro malignant human cell lines: skin epidermoid carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, cervix adenocarcinoma, and breast adenocarcinoma. &quot;Betula pendula&quot; bark extract is also effective for treating actinic keratosis.

==Cultivation==

Successful birch cultivation requires a climate cool enough for at least the occasional winter snowfall. As they are shallow-rooted, they may require water during dry periods. They grow best in full sun planted in deep, well-drained soil.

===Cultivars and varieties===
* &#x27;Carelica&#x27; or &quot;curly birch&quot; is called &quot;visakoivu&quot; in Finland. The wood is hard and burled throughout; it is prized for its decorative appearance and is used in wood-carving and as veneer.
* &#x27;Laciniata&#x27; (commonly misidentified as &#x27;Dalecarlica&#x27;) has deeply incised leaves and weeping branches
* &#x27;Purpurea&#x27; has dark purple leaves
* &#x27;Tristis&#x27; has an erect trunk with weeping branchlets
* &#x27;Youngii&#x27; has dense, twiggy, weeping growth with no central leader and requires being grafted onto a standard stem of normal silver birch.

The cultivars marked above have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<text>Umán Municipality is a municipality in the Mexican state of Yucatán containing (234.30 km2) of land and located roughly 15 km southwest of the city of Mérida. The word &quot;Umán&quot; means “purchase” in the Yucatec Maya language.

==History==
There is no accurate data on when the town was founded, though it existed before the conquest and in antiquity belonged to the chieftainship of Ah Canul. At colonization, Umán became part of the encomienda system with Francisco Hernández recorded as one of the earliest encomenderos.

Yucatán declared its independence from the Spanish Crown in 1821 and in 1825, the area was assigned to the Lower Camino Real with its headquarters in Hunucma Municipality. In 1921, was designated as its own municipality.

==Governance==
The municipal president is elected for a three-year term. The town council has nine councilpersons, who serve as Secretary and councilors of heritage and sports, policing, education and health, public works, potable water, rural development and social management, roads and markets, nomenclature and recruiting, ecology, public monuments.

==Communities==
The head of the municipality is Umán, Yucatán. There are 87 populated areas of the municipality. The most notable include Bolón, Dzibikak, Dzununcán, Itzincab, Oxcum, Oxholón, Poxilá, San Antonio Mulix, Tebec, Xtepen, and Yaxcopoil. The significant populations are shown below:

==Local festivals==

<text>Michael Northburgh, otherwise Michael de Northburgh (Northborough), was the Bishop of London between 1354 and his death in 1361. He was the nephew of Roger Northburgh, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield.

Northburgh&#x27;s uncle&#x27;s influence enabled him to be appointed Archdeacon of Chester in 1341 (until forced to resign in 1342) and Archdeacon of Suffolk in 1347 (until 1353) before he had been ordained into higher orders. Whilst archdeacon he became Rector of Pulham St. Mary (1341) and acquired many canonries. He occupied the office of Lord Privy Seal between 1350 and 1354.

Northburgh was elected Bishop of London on 22 April 1354 and consecrated on 12 July 1355. His most lasting achievement as bishop was in helping to found the Charterhouse. He bought land from Sir Walter de Manny and by his will left £2000 &#x27;for the foundation of a House according to the ritual of the Carthusian order in a place commonly called &quot;Newchirchehawe&quot;, where there is a church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

Northburgh accompanied King Edward III of England on the English expedition to France which included the Battle of Crécy (1346) and acted as royal clerk, writing an eyewitness account in a newsletter from the English camp, and giving the French casualties as 1,542 &quot;without reckoning the commons and foot-soldiers&quot;.

Northburgh died of the plague on 9 September 1361. In his will he left valuable books and artifacts to the illegitimate Michael Northborough, a future Archdeacon of Colchester.

<text>The 1857 United Kingdom general election was held between 27 March 1857 to 24 April 1857, to elect members of the House of Commons, the lower house of Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Whigs, led by Lord Palmerston, won a majority in the House of Commons as the Conservative vote fell significantly. The election had been provoked by a vote of censure in Palmerston&#x27;s government over his approach to the &quot;Arrow&quot; affair which led to the Second Opium War.

There is no separate tally of votes or seats for the Peelites. They did not contest elections as an organised party but more as independent Free trade Conservatives with varying degrees of distance from the two main parties.

According to A. J. P. Taylor:
:The general election of 1857 is unique in our history: the only election ever conducted as a simple plebiscite in favour of an individual. Even the &quot;coupon&quot; election of 1918 claimed to be more than a plebiscite for Lloyd George; even Disraeli and Gladstone offered a clash of policies as well as of personalities. In 1857 there was no issue before the electorate except whether Palmerston should be Prime Minister; and no one could pretend that Palmerston had any policy except to be himself.

<text>Azay-le-Rideau () is a commune in the Indre-et-Loire department in the Centre-Val de Loire region in central-west France.

==Château==
The château of Azay-le-Rideau was built from 1515 to 1527, one of the earliest French Renaissance châteaux. Built on an island in the river Indre, its foundations rise straight out of the water. It is one of the best known of the châteaux of the Loire valley.

==Church==

There is a church dedicated to Saint Symphorien near the château that is interesting for the number of architectural periods incorporated in its design. While the newest portion dates from 1603, the current façade incorporates an older 9th century façade in the Carolingian style. The original carved figures are still visible, though an added window destroyed part of the second row. The rest of the church is of a Romanesque style. It was built between 1518 and 1527.

==Wine==
Azay-le-Rideau is the centre of the Touraine Azay-le-Rideau AOC for white and rosé wine.

==Population==
==Twin towns==
Azay-le-Rideau is twinned with Croston in Lancashire, England.

==In popular culture==
The exterior design of the château d&#x27;Azay-le-Rideau&#x27;s main building (as well as its surrounding area, for the most part) was used by Konami video game developing company as the prime inspiration and a direct structural base of the &quot;Villa&quot; location in the video games &quot;Castlevania 64&quot; (appears during &quot;Stage 03&quot; of the game) and &quot;&quot; (appears during &quot;Stage 04&quot; of the game), both of which were released for Nintendo 64 home TV video gaming platform during January and November 1999 respectively.

<doc id="446862" wikidata="Q3943728" url="?curid=446862" title="1852 United Kingdom general election">
<text>The 1852 United Kingdom general election was held from 7 to 31 July 1852. It produced a closely contested result between the Conservatives and Whigs, marking a significant shift in British politics, with the Conservatives increasingly representing the rural aristocracy and the Whigs the urban bourgeoisie.

As in the previous election of 1847, Lord John Russell&#x27;s Whigs won the popular vote, but the Conservative Party won a very slight majority of the seats. However, a split between Protectionist Tories, led by the Earl of Derby, and the Peelites who supported Lord Aberdeen made the formation of a majority government very difficult. Lord Derby&#x27;s minority, protectionist government ruled from 23 February until 17 December 1852. Derby appointed Benjamin Disraeli as Chancellor of the Exchequer in this minority government. However, in December 1852, Derby&#x27;s government collapsed because of issues arising out of the budget introduced by Disraeli. A Peelite–Whig-Radical coalition government was then formed under Lord Aberdeen. Although the immediate issue involved in this vote of &quot;no confidence&quot; which caused the downfall of the Derby minority government was the budget, the real underlying issue was the repeal of the Corn Laws which Parliament had passed in June 1846 and had split the Conservative Party. In this election, there were 18 Peelites elected in England and Wales. The constituency of St Albans, with its two members, was disfranchised due to corruption. This accounts for the fact that there were two fewer seats in the House of Commons as compared to the previous election, though no redistribution took place.
==Corn Laws==

A group within the Tory/Conservative Party called the &quot;Peelites&quot; voted with the Whigs to achieve the repeal of the Corn Laws. The Peelites were so named because they were followers of Prime Minister Robert Peel. In June 1846, when Peel was the Prime Minister of a Tory government, he led a group of Tory/Conservatives to vote with the minority Whigs against a majority of his own party.

&quot;Corn&quot; was important to the cost of living of the average person in Britain during the early 19th century. The term &quot;corn&quot; did not refer to maize, as it did in the United States. In Britain, &quot;corn&quot; refers to wheat, rye and/or other grains. Wheat, or corn, was used in the baking of bread and was the &quot;staff of life&quot;. Thus the price of wheat was a very substantial part of the cost of living. The Corn Laws enforced a very high &quot;protective&quot; tariff against the importation of wheat into England. These high tariffs raised the cost of living and increased the suffering of poor people in England. Agitation for the repeal of the Corn Laws had begun in England as early as 1837, and bills for their repeal had been introduced in Parliament each year from 1837 until their actual repeal in 1847.

==Split in the Tory party==
For some parliamentary leaders, like John Bright, Richard Cobden and Charles Pelham Villiers, the repeal of tariffs on imported corn was not enough. They wished to reduce the tariffs on all imported consumer products. These parliamentary leaders became known as &quot;free traders&quot;. The repeal of the Corn Laws irrevocably split the Tory/Conservative party. The Peelites were not free traders, but both the Peelites and the free traders were originally Tories. Thus both the free traders and the Peelites tended to side with the Whigs against the Tories on international trade issues. This presented a real threat to any government the Tories attempted to form. The effect of this split was felt in the election of July–August 1847, when the Whig party won a 53.8% majority of seats in Parliament. The Whigs knew that they could count on the Peelite Conservatives when an international trade issue came before Parliament. In June 1852, the effects of the split in the Tory/Conservative party was having even more effect. The period after about 1847 was one of economic stagnation in Britain.

==Political parties==
The split in the Tory party was a significant cause of the reformation of the political parties in Britain in the February 1852 election.

As noted above, in the election of 1852 the protectionist rump of the Conservatives became the party of the rural landholders, while the Liberals and Peelites became the party of the towns, boroughs and growing urban industrial areas of Britain.

In 1852, England elected 244 Conservatives and 216 non-Conservatives; Wales elected 20 Conservatives and 12 non-Conservatives, Scotland elected 20 Conservatives and 33 non-Conservatives, Ireland elected 40 Conservatives and 63 non-Conservatives whereas the Universities elected 6 Conservatives.

==Fall of the government in December 1852==
The election of 1852 returned a majority in support of free-trade, but the minority Conservative government continued in office. An opportunity for the opposition arose in December 1852, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Benjamin Disraeli, introduced the budget of the Derby minority government. Due to the worsening economic situation, the budget imposed a number of tax increases on the profits of the middle class and granted some tax cuts for the rural landed aristocracy. The budget also extended the income tax to the Irish middle class, angering some of the members from Ireland who had supported the minority government on the Irish Church issue and were opposed to the previous Prime Minister, the Liberal leader Lord John Russell. Consequently, a number of Irish Conservatives voted against the minority government on the Disraeli budget on 17 December 1852. This vote of &quot;no confidence&quot; caused the government to fall.

Following the fall of the minority government, Lord Aberdeen was called on to form a government, since the Irish Conservatives who opposed Disraeli&#x27;s budget were opposed to Lord John Russell on religious issues and he formed a Peelite/Whig coalition government on 19 December 1852. This government served until 30 January 1855, when it too collapsed due to issues surrounding British involvement in the Crimean War.

==Results==

|}

While the Conservatives had, in theory, a slim majority over the Whigs, the party was divided between Protectionist and Peelite wings: the former numbered about 290 and the latter 35–40. The Whigs themselves represented a coalition of old Whigs (conservative Protestant/dissenter aristocrats), Liberals, Radicals, and Irish nationalists. The above numbers therefore do not represent the true balance of support in Parliament.

<text>Macaroni and cheese (also known as mac and cheese in Canada and the United States and macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom) is a dish of macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar sauce. Its origins trace back to cheese and pasta casseroles in medieval England. The traditional macaroni and cheese is put in a casserole and baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix. The cheese is often included as a Mornay sauce added to the pasta. It has been described as &quot;comfort food&quot;.

==History==

A cheese and pasta casserole known as &quot;makerouns&quot; was recorded in 1390, in medieval English, in the cookbook the &quot;Forme of Cury&quot;. It was made with fresh, hand-cut pasta which was sandwiched between a mixture of melted butter and cheese, the recipe comparing it to &quot;losyns&quot;, a dish similar to lasagne. The recipe given (in Middle English) was:

The first modern recipe for macaroni and cheese was included in Elizabeth Raffald&#x27;s 1769 book, &quot;The Experienced English Housekeeper&quot;. Raffald&#x27;s recipe is for a Béchamel sauce with cheddar cheese—a Mornay sauce in French cooking—which is mixed with macaroni, sprinkled with Parmesan, and baked until bubbly and golden.

Another recipe from 1784 stated that the small tubes of macaroni must be boiled, then drained in a sifter before being moved to a frying pan. Heavy cream is then added to the macaroni along with a &quot;knob of butter&quot; rolled in flour, and it must be cooked for five minutes before being transferred to a dish and topped with toasted Parmesan and pepper. Eliza Acton&#x27;s &quot;Modern Cookery in All Its Branches&quot; (1845) has a similar recipe for macaroni and cheese, called &quot;Macaroni a la Reine&quot;, which states that while the macaroni is being boiled to its tenderness, the cook must &quot;dissolve gently ten ounces of any rich, well-flavoured white cheese in full three quarters of a pint of good cream; add a little salt, a rather full seasoning of cayenne, from half to a whole saltspoonful of pounded mace, and a couple of ounces of sweet fresh butter&quot;. The recipe goes on that &quot;the maccaroni, previously well-drained, may then be tossed gently in it, or after it is dished, the cheese may be poured equally over the maccaroni&quot; before being thickly covered with breadcrumbs &quot;fried of a pale gold color, and dried perfectly, either before the fire or in an oven, when such an addition is considered an improvement.&quot;

The 1861 edition of the famous British Victorian cookbook &quot;Mrs. Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot; included two instances of &quot;Macaroni, as usually served with the Cheese Course&quot;. One of them states:

In the United Kingdom, during the 2010s, it has seen a surge in popularity, becoming widespread as a meal and as a side order in both fast food and upmarket restaurants.

=== United States ===
James Hemings, a classically trained French chef enslaved by US president Thomas Jefferson, was instrumental in bringing the recipe to the United States after Jefferson encountered it in Paris. Jefferson drew a sketch of the pasta and wrote detailed notes on the extrusion process. In 1793, he commissioned the US ambassador to France William Short to purchase a machine for making it. Evidently, the machine was not suitable, as Jefferson later imported both macaroni and Parmesan cheese for his use at Monticello. In 1802, Jefferson served &quot;a pie called macaroni&quot; at a state dinner. The menu of the dinner was reported by Reverend Manasseh Cutler, who apparently was not fond of the cheesy macaroni casserole. Nevertheless, since that time, baked macaroni and cheese has remained popular in the United States.

A recipe called &quot;macaroni and cheese&quot; appeared in the 1824 cookbook &quot;The Virginia House-Wife&quot; written by Mary Randolph. Randolph&#x27;s recipe had three ingredients: macaroni, cheese, and butter, layered together and baked in a hot oven. The cookbook was the most influential cookbook of the 19th century, according to culinary historian Karen Hess. Similar recipes for macaroni and cheese occur in the 1852 &quot;Hand-book of Useful Arts&quot;, and the 1861 &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot;. By the mid-1880s, cookbooks as far west as Kansas and Festus, Missouri, included recipes for macaroni and cheese casseroles. Factory production of the main ingredients made the dish affordable, and recipes made it accessible, but not notably popular. As it became accessible to a broader section of society, macaroni and cheese lost its upper-class appeal.

=== Canada ===
Macaroni and cheese was brought to Canada by British immigrants, coming from other parts of the British Empire. Macaroni and cheese recipes have been attested in Canada since at least &quot;Modern Practical Cookery&quot; in 1845, which suggests a puff pastry lining (suggesting upper-class refinement); a sauce of cream, egg yolks, mace, and mustard; and grated Parmesan or Cheshire cheese on top. Canadian Cheddar cheese was also becoming popularized at this time and was likely also used during that era.

Macaroni and cheese is very popular in contemporary Canada. Kraft Dinner is the most popular brand of packaged macaroni and cheese. Sasha Chapman, writing in &quot;The Walrus&quot;, considered it to be Canada&#x27;s national dish, ahead of poutine. In fact, Canadians purchase nearly 25% of the 7 million boxes of Kraft Dinner sold worldwide each week.

==Variations==

Pasta other than macaroni are often used: almost any short-cut extruded pasta and many of the decorative cut pasta will do, particularly those with folds and pockets to hold the cheese. When made with conchiglie the dish may be referred to as &quot;shells and cheese&quot;.

While cheddar cheese is most commonly used for macaroni and cheese, other cheeses may also be used — usually sharp in flavour — and two or more cheeses can be combined. Other cheeses can be used such as Gruyère, Gouda, Havarti, and Jarlsberg cheese.

Macaroni and cheese can be made by simply layering slices of cheese and pasta (often with butter or evaporated milk) then baking in a casserole, rather than preparing as a cheese sauce. Also, some like to include a crunchy topping to their baked macaroni and cheese by topping it off with bread crumbs or crushed crackers, which also keeps the noodles on top from drying out when baking.
One novelty presentation is deep-fried macaroni and cheese found at fairs and food carts.

===Regional variations and analogues===

In Scotland, macaroni and cheese can often be found in pies, known as a macaroni pie.

In 1731, the monastery of Disentis in Switzerland purchased a macaroni machine. Monasteries in the country were also known for cheesemaking. Though it is unknown when exactly it was invented, around the 19th century, the traditional dish in Switzerland called &quot;Älplermagronen&quot; (Alpine herder&#x27;s macaroni) became popular. &quot;Älplermagronen&quot; are made of macaroni, cream, cheese, roasted onions, and in some recipes, potatoes. In the Canton of Uri, the potatoes are traditionally omitted, and in some regions, bacon or ham is added. The cheese is often Emmental cheese or Appenzeller cheese. It is usually accompanied by apple sauce.

==Prepared and packaged mixes==

The earliest known iteration of boxed macaroni and cheese came from a salesman in St. Louis, Missouri named Grant Leslie. Leslie used rubber bands to attach processed cheese produced by Kraft Foods to boxes of pasta in an attempt to increase pasta sales. Kraft hired Leslie and began to produce Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese (known as Kraft Dinner or KD in Canada) in 1937 with the slogan &quot;make a meal for four in nine minutes&quot;. It was an immediate success in the US and Canada amidst the economic hardships of the Depression. During the Second World War, rationing led to increased popularity for the product, of which two boxes could be obtained for one food rationing stamp, or one box for 19 cents.

Packaged macaroni and cheese are now available in frozen form or as boxed ingredients for simplified preparation. Boston Market, Michelina&#x27;s, Kraft Foods, Cracker Barrel, and Stouffer&#x27;s are some of the more recognizable brands of prepared and frozen macaroni and cheese available in the United States. Macaroni and Cheese is also available canned and in microwavable containers. &quot;Macaroni and cheese loaf&quot;, a deli meat which contains both macaroni and processed cheese bits, can be found in some stores. A variety of packaged mixes that are prepared in a sauce pan on the stove or in a microwave oven are available. Some different products on the market use this basic formulation with minor variations in ingredients.

Although high in carbohydrates, calories, fat, and salt, macaroni and cheese is a source of protein and certain variations of the dish can decrease the negative health aspects.

The album features guest appearances from Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, Michel&#x27;le, The Lady of Rage, Tray Deee, and Mr. Malik. Two singles were released from the album: &quot;Let&#x27;s Play House&quot; (featuring Michel&#x27;le and Nate Dogg) and &quot;New York, New York&quot; (featuring Snoop Doggy Dogg).

It debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart on November 18, 1995. The album sold 278,000 copies in its first week. It is one of the last high-selling and critically acclaimed releases from the label, preceding only &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot; and Tupac&#x27;s releases as an anticipated album, and is the last to be &quot;officially&quot; produced under the G-funk era of hip-hop, with Death Row Records&#x27; future releases diverging from the style. Though Dr. Dre was Death Row&#x27;s top producer, the album was mostly produced by Daz Dillinger, while Dre mixed the album. &quot;Dogg Food&quot; led the way for Daz to become the top in-house producer for Death Row until his departure in the late 1990s.

The video for the first single, &quot;New York, New York&quot;, caused some controversy when Snoop appeared in it kicking down buildings throughout New York. The trailer of Tha Dogg Pound was shot at during the process of making the &quot;New York, New York&quot; video although no one was injured. The song is one of three tracks on the album not produced by Daz, as DJ Pooh provided the beat.

==Background==
Its controversial lyrics were the subject of shareholder protest. The album was supposed to be released in August 1995, but as a result of the controversy from Time Warner, the release was delayed by two months.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; wrote that the album &quot;revealed a comparative deftness of touch and a penchant for self-parody largely lacking in [the group&#x27;s] more esteemed colleagues.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; opined that Tha Dogg Pound&#x27;s &quot;variation on what has become a stale formula is less sample-driven than most gangsta funk; instead, it focuses on the formidable verbal flow and rhyme skills of Daz and Kurupt.&quot; &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote that &quot;the music here sounds wonderfully fresh, from the growling synth-bass of &#x27;Smooth&#x27; to the dreamy, slightly tropical pulse of &#x27;Big Pimpin&#x27; 2&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; called the album &quot;a low-key, unambitious and only mildly imaginative replay of &quot;Doggystyle&quot;, rolling over familiar G-funk terrain with the same minimum of venom and violence.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Dogg Food&quot; debuted at number one on both the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts, selling 278,000 copies in its first week (the week ending on November 5, 1995). The album was certified 2× platinum on January 5, 1996.

<text>Tha Dogg Pound is an American hip-hop duo composed of West Coast rappers Kurupt and Daz Dillinger. They were among the first acts to sign to Death Row Records in 1992.

Kurupt and Daz went on to release solo albums starting in 1998; they left the crumbling Death Row Records following year. Daz left due to long-lasting internal struggles on the label after friend and labelmate Tupac Shakur&#x27;s murder in 1996. Kurupt started Antra Records, while Daz and Soopafly started D.P.G. Recordz. In 2002, a feud arose between the two when Kurupt decided to sign back with Death Row Records, upsetting everyone involved with the group. His awaited Death Row release &quot;Against the Grain&quot; had been postponed several times while Kurupt was on the label, later being released in August 2005, after he was off. In January 2005, Daz made another solo album release titled &quot;Tha Dogg Pound Gangsta LP&quot;. Tha Dogg Pound then got back together as a group and released &quot;Dillinger &amp; Young Gotti II&quot; in November 2005. In 2006, Snoop Dogg executive produced released their official reunion album &quot;Cali Iz Active&quot;.

== History ==
=== Death Row years (1992–1998) ===
Before &quot;The Chronic&quot; album came out, Kurupt and Daz were solo artists. Having heard the chemistry they had while recording the album, Dr. Dre suggested they form a group. The two went on to feature on &quot;Doggystyle&quot; and various features and soundtracks as Tha Dogg Pound.

Between 1993 and 1994, the group assisted Hammer on his &quot;The Funky Headhunter&quot; album (such as the song &quot;Sleepin&#x27; on a Master Plan&quot; and others), along with Suge Knight and the Whole 9.

In 1995, they released their debut album &quot;Dogg Food&quot; under Death Row Records. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and went on to reach twice platinum status. &quot;Let&#x27;s Play House&quot; was the biggest hit, breaking into the Top 50 of the Billboard Hot 100, while &quot;New York, New York&quot; was an MTV favorite; in the video for the latter, Daz and Snoop stomped Godzilla-like around the Big Apple, taunting their East Coast rivals. In the October that followed, towards the end of the same year, Tupac Shakur had been bailed out of jail by Death Row&#x27;s Suge Knight in exchange for releasing his following four albums on Death Row Records.

In 1996, Tha Dogg Pound were featured on 2Pac&#x27;s Death Row Records debut album &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; with Kurupt featured in &quot;Got My Mind Made Up&quot; and &quot;Check Out Time&quot; and Daz Dillinger producing the hit songs &quot;2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted&quot;, &quot;Ambitionz az a Ridah&quot;, and &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Mad At Cha&quot;. They made an appearance on Snoop Doggy Dogg&#x27;s album &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot;.

=== Kurupt and Daz leave Death Row (1998–2001) ===
In January 1998, Kurupt left Death Row but remained in Tha Dogg Pound. Kurupt released two solo albums in 1998 (&quot;Kuruption!&quot;) and 1999 (&quot;Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha&quot;) that had Daz Dillinger and the rest of DPG on them. However, in 1998, Daz was making noise of his own over at Death Row and released his only Death Row album (&quot;Retaliation, Revenge and Get Back&quot;). Afterward, he made his own label called Mobstyle Muzik, in which he had his first taste of the independent scene. Mobstyle&#x27;s first release &quot;Poppa Snoop Presents Mobstyle Muzik Volume 1&quot; failed and Daz returned to Death Row. He later started up DPG Recordz along with Christopher &quot;Big C-Style&quot; Bowden through Death Row Records.

Daz also eventually parted ways with Death Row in December 1998 and released his first independent album &quot;R.A.W.&quot; in 2000. That was followed by the D.P.G. album from Tha Dogg Pound entitled &quot;Dillinger &amp; Young Gotti.&quot; After Tha Dogg Pound&#x27;s full departure from Death Row, Suge Knight claimed ownership of the name &quot;Tha Dogg Pound&quot; and any tracks recorded prior to them leaving. To avoid a legal battle at the time, Daz changed their marketing name to D.P.G. short for Dogg Pound Gangstaz. In 2001, Suge Knight released a Dogg Pound album entitled &quot;2002&quot;, which consisted of unreleased Dogg Pound tracks. Soopafly&#x27;s songs were featured on his 2001 solo album &quot;Dat Whoopty Woop&quot;.

=== External matters ===
Over the years, Tha Dogg Pound had beef with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, due to Death Row Records being embroiled in a feud with Eazy-E&#x27;s Ruthless Records. Tha Dogg Pound made a diss towards The Bone Thugs, on the song &quot;Dogg Pound Gangstaz&quot;, with Kurupt&#x27;s line &quot;Ain&#x27;t got no love for no hoes in harmony.&quot; In response Layzie Bone shot back on the track &quot;Shotz to tha Double Glock&quot; with the line &quot;Dogg Pound hoes it&#x27;s on.&quot;, and Krayzie Bone with &quot;Gotta find these &#x27;Row Hoes&quot; in the song &quot;Mo&#x27; Murda&quot; off the album &quot;E. 1999 Eternal&quot;. The feud ended when Snoop Dogg and Kurupt were featured on Krayzie Bone&#x27;s album &quot;Thug Mentality 1999&quot; in the song &quot;The War Iz On.&quot; Kurupt was featured on Flesh-N-Bone&#x27;s song &quot;Kurupted Flesh&quot; on the &quot;5th Dog Let Loose&quot;. Krayzie Bone also featured on Daz Dillinger&#x27;s 2008 solo album &quot;Only on the Left Side&quot; on the song &quot;Meal Ticket&quot; and later on the song &quot;Money Fold&#x27;N&quot; on Tha Dogg Pound&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot;.

Tha Dogg Pound were also involved in a feud with B.G. Knocc Out &amp; Dresta. In response to Eazy-E&#x27;s &quot;Real Muthaphukkin G&#x27;s&quot; and Kokane &amp; Cold 187um&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Bite The Funk&quot;, Tha Dogg Pound along with Snoop Dogg made a track called &quot;What Would You Do&quot; with such lines as: &quot;Fuck B.G. Knocc Out and every nigga down with him.&quot; Later B.G. Knocc Out &amp; Dresta retaliated with the song &quot;D.P.G. Killa&quot;, on their debut album &quot;Real Brothas&quot;. They have since squashed the beef and released a song called &quot;Blaze It Up&quot;, as a bonus track on Tha Dogg Pound&#x27;s &quot;Dogg Chit&quot; album.

The duo engaged in yet another conflict, the beef Suge and new signee 2Pac initiated against Bad Boy Entertainment&#x27;s Puff Daddy and Notorious B.I.G.; Daz and Kurupt would expand the feud to include Capone-N-Noreaga, Tragedy Khadafi and Mobb Deep with their Snoop-assisted single &quot;New York, New York.&quot;

In late 2002, Kurupt shocked the entire DPGC and fans alike, when he accepted the job of executive producer at Death Row Records. Daz, Soopafly, Snoop Dogg, and the rest of DPGC viewed this as betrayal and took many shots and dissed Kurupt harshly for making the move. Kurupt did the same claiming they all were wrong to have turned their backs on Death Row. They declared war between both camps and that he was not the one who changed, rather them.

The rap duo heavily dissed each other from 2003 to late 2004, both recording diss albums against each other. Daz took aim at Kurupt and Death Row with his single &quot;U Ain&#x27;t Shit&quot; featuring Bad Azz and another song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Give a Fucc&quot; which is sung over the beat to 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;In Da Club&quot;. Kurupt responded heavily with his &quot;Originals&quot; album which featured many disses throughout nearly every song, most notably the bonus track &quot;Eat a Dicc (Fucc Daz)&quot;.

=== Reunion (2005–2023) ===
The feud continued until April 2005 when Kurupt and Daz made a truce. The struggling Death Row Records failed to promote Kurupt&#x27;s album &quot;Against Tha Grain&quot; and the duo began to feel remorse for one another. Kurupt left Death Row and reunited with Daz. The duo started rapping together again and even made a new album together entitled &quot;Dillinger &amp; Young Gotti II: Tha Saga Continuez.&quot; After &quot;The Western Conference&quot; in 2005 the two of them agreed to revitalize the DPGC by working together once again on an album with Snoop Dogg, Soopafly, Nate Dogg, Warren G, RBX, Lady of Rage and Lil&#x27; ½ Dead with Snoop taking over the producing and distributing tasks for it.

Tha Dogg Pound then released a joint venture reunion comeback project the next year in 2006 called &quot;Cali Iz Active&quot; under the aegis of Snoop Dogg&#x27;s Doggystyle Records with the main single &quot;Cali Iz Active&quot; featuring Snoop Dogg and a wide range of new producers throughout the album.
Tha Dogg Pound released the album &quot;Dogg Chit&quot; independently on March 27, 2007, touting it as a sequel to their debut. In August 2007 it was announced that the duo was in the process of signing to Cash Money Records; their next album was announced as &quot;Westcoast Aftershocc&quot;. The pair released the singles &quot;Ch-Ching&quot; and &quot;Mystic River&quot; from the album, but when the deal stalled, they postponed the project in favor of a separate album, &quot;100 Wayz&quot;. Tha Dogg Pound began putting out singles for the latter album as early as 2008, releasing &quot;Cheat&quot; featuring Pharrell and following up with &quot;They Don&#x27;t Want It&quot; featuring Soopafly, and &quot;Get My Drink on &amp; My Smoke On.&quot; Although &quot;100 Wayz&quot; was expected for release that year, it was postponed due to a dispute with Koch Records head Alan Grunblatt; instead, they released the album &quot;That Was Then, This is Now&quot;, which included the singles originally intended for &quot;100 Wayz&quot;, in late 2009.

After putting out the compilation album &quot;Keep on Ridin&quot; in May 2010, &quot;100 Wayz&quot; finally saw release in July of that year. Since then, the duo announced several projects, including &quot;Dillinger &amp; Young Gotti III: Get Paid&quot;, a collaboration album with Pete Rock, and a re-announcement of the album &quot;Westcoast Aftershocc&quot; for 2011, as well as several solo projects from Kurupt working with various producers, from DJ Premier and Pete Rock to Fredwreck. However, their only releases of late have been Kurupt&#x27;s solo album &quot;Street Lights&quot; and two projects from Daz Dillinger.

Recently, tha Dogg Pound has been involved in various side projects; Kurupt announced the formation of supergroup 1st Generation, made up of himself, King Tee, Sir Jinx, Gangsta of tha Comradz and MC Eiht and producer Tha Chill of Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted. Both Kurupt and Daz have formed a supergroup called the N&#x27;Matez consisting of themselves, the Lady of Rage, and RBX. In December 2011, Tha Dogg Pound put out the single &quot;Forever in a Day,&quot; featuring Snoop Dogg, although they have not announced whether it is attached to a specific project. A few days later, the duo announced that their next group album will be entitled &quot;Alumni&quot; and is set to be executive produced by Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre, who will be co-producing and/or mixing several of the beats. The album will mark the first time a member of Tha Dogg Pound has collaborated with Dr. Dre since Kurupt&#x27;s appearances on the producer&#x27;s album &quot;2001&quot;, and the first time Dre has collaborated with Tha Dogg Pound as a duo since he mixed their debut album, &quot;Dogg Food&quot;. On December 2, 2012, Tha Dogg Pound released a collaboration mixtape with Snoop Dogg titled &quot;That&#x27;s My Work Vol. 1&quot;.

In 2021, Tha Dogg Pound were prepping to release their &quot;Dogg Food II&quot; album with the lead single &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll&quot; debuted in late 2020. Their follow-up single &quot;Nice &amp; Slow&quot; was released in July 2021 and featured Snoop Dogg. In 2023, Daz Dillinger shared on social media that the album would be released soon on Dogg Pound Records. As of April 2024, the album is yet to be released.

=== Back on Death Row (2024–) ===
In April 2024, a new song, titled &quot;Smoke Up&quot;, was released featuring Snoop Dogg. The end of the song&#x27;s music video promoted a new album, titled &quot;W.A.W.G.

<text>The 1847 United Kingdom general election was held from 29 July to 26 August 1847. It saw the Conservatives win the most seats but remain divided between Protectionists and Peelites. This allowed the Whigs, led by Prime Minister Lord John Russell, to retain power.

The Irish Repeal group won more seats than in the previous general election, while the Chartists gained the only seat they were ever to hold, Nottingham&#x27;s second seat, held by Chartist leader Feargus O&#x27;Connor.

The election also witnessed the election of Britain&#x27;s first Jewish MP, the Liberal Lionel de Rothschild in the City of London. Members being sworn in were however required to swear the Christian Oath of Allegiance, meaning Rothschild was unable actually to take his seat until the passage of the Jews Relief Act in 1858. The constituency of Sudbury, which elected two members, was disfranchised for this election. This accounts there being two fewer seats in the House of Commons as compared to the previous election, though no redistribution took place.

<text>The 1841 United Kingdom general election was held between 29 June and 22 July 1841. Following increasing government defeats, the Conservatives under Sir Robert Peel won a decisive victory against the governing Whigs.

The Conservatives campaigned mainly on an 11-point programme modified from their previous electoral effort and designed by Peel, whilst the Whigs emphasised reforming the import duties on corn, replacing the existing sliding scale with a uniform rate. The Whig position lost them support amongst protectionists, and the Whigs saw heavy losses in constituencies like the West Riding, where aristocratic Whig families who held a strong tradition of unbroken representation in Parliament were rejected by the electorate.

O&#x27;Connell, who had been governing with the Whigs through a compact, felt the government&#x27;s unpopularity rub off on him. His own party was shattered in the election. Barely a dozen Repealers retained their seats, and O&#x27;Connell himself lost in Dublin while his son was defeated in Carlow. The Chartists picked up only a few votes.

<doc id="446876" wikidata="Q4680725" url="?curid=446876" title="Adaptive coding">
<text>Adaptive coding refers to variants of entropy encoding methods of lossless data compression. They are particularly suited to streaming data, as they adapt to localized changes in the characteristics of the data, and don&#x27;t require a first pass over the data to calculate a probability model. The cost paid for these advantages is that the encoder and decoder must be more complex to keep their states synchronized, and more computational power is needed to keep adapting the encoder/decoder state.

Almost all data compression methods involve the use of a &quot;model&quot;, a prediction of the composition of the data. When the data matches the prediction made by the model, the encoder can usually transmit the content of the data at a lower information cost, by making reference to the model.
This general statement is a bit misleading as general data compression algorithms would include the popular LZW and LZ77 algorithms,
which are hardly comparable to compression techniques typically called &quot;adaptive&quot;.
Run-length encoding and the typical JPEG compression with run length encoding and predefined Huffman codes do not transmit a model.
A lot of other methods adapt their model to the current file and need to transmit it in addition to the encoded data, because both the encoder and the decoder need to use the model.

In adaptive coding, the encoder and decoder are instead equipped with a predefined meta-model about how they will alter their models in response to the actual content of the data, and otherwise start with a blank slate, meaning that no initial model needs to be transmitted. As the data is transmitted, both encoder and decoder adapt their models, so that unless the character of the data changes radically, the model becomes better-adapted to the data it is handling and compresses it more efficiently approaching the efficiency of the static coding.

# Initialize the data model based on a first pass over the data.
# Transmit the data model.

## Encode the next symbol using the data model and send it.

===Decoder===
# Receive the data model.
# While there is more data to receive
## Decode the next symbol using the data model and output it.

== Examples ==
Adaptive image coding was used by the Cassini-Huygens craft to relay images from Saturn. Only about 5% of the images show any visual signs of damage. As the spacecraft has an error correcting Flash drive and long timeframes between image taking events, damaged images like this can be present. It is assumed that the number of damaged, but unrecoverable images from the Cassini mission is about 0.01% or less.

=== Cassini Lossless Compression ===
* Both converted (8-bit) and unconverted (12-bit) data can be losslessly compressed. The Cassini hardware data compressor uses a modified Huffman encoding scheme as part of its adaptive compressor.
* Each compressed image can be reconstructed on the ground with no loss to the information content of the image, provided the image entropy does not exceed the threshold where 2:1 compression is reached.
* Due to camera problems and the need to reduce file size, there is a slight modification to the image coding scheme so that each compressed line is effectively bandwidth limited on the number of bits available to encode it.

<text>Armin Hofmann (HonRDI) (29 June 1920 – 18 December 2020) was a Swiss graphic designer. He was one of the most prominent individuals in Swiss design.

He began his career in 1947 as a teacher at the Allgemeine Gewerbeschule Basel School of Art and Crafts at the age of twenty-six. Hofmann followed Emil Ruder as head of the graphic design department at the Schule für Gestaltung Basel (Basel School of Design) and was instrumental in developing the graphic design style known as the Swiss Style. His teaching methods were unorthodox and broad based, setting new standards that became widely known in design education institutions throughout the world. His independent insights as an educator, married with his rich and innovative powers of visual expression, created a body of work enormously varied – books, exhibitions, stage sets, logotypes, symbols, typography, posters, sign systems, and environmental graphics. His work is recognized for its reliance on the fundamental elements of graphic form – point, line, and shape – while subtly conveying simplicity, complexity, representation, and abstraction. Originating in Russia, Germany and The Netherlands in the 1920s, stimulated by the artistic avant-garde and alongside the International Style in architecture. He is well known for his posters, which emphasized economical use of colour and fonts, in reaction to what Hofmann regarded as the &quot;trivialization of colour.&quot; His posters have been widely exhibited as works of art in major galleries, such as the New York Museum of Modern Art.

He was also an influential educator, retiring in 1987. In 1965 he wrote the &quot;Graphic Design Manual&quot;, a popular textbook in the field.

Hofmann died in December 2020 at the age of 100 in Lucerne, where he lived with his wife Dorothea Hofmann-Schmid.

<text>The 1835 United Kingdom general election was called when Parliament was dissolved on 29 December 1834. Polling took place between 6 January and 6 February 1835, and the results saw Robert Peel&#x27;s Conservatives make large gains from their low of the 1832 election, but the Whigs maintained a large majority.

Under the terms of the Lichfield House Compact the Whigs had entered into an electoral pact with the Irish Repeal Association of Daniel O&#x27;Connell, which had contested the previous election as a separate party. The Radicals were also included in this alliance.
== Dates of election ==
The eleventh United Kingdom Parliament was dissolved on 29 December 1834. The new Parliament was summoned to meet on 19 February 1835, for a maximum seven-year term from that date. The maximum term could be and normally was curtailed, by the monarch dissolving the Parliament, before its term expired.

At this period there was not one election day. After receiving a writ (a royal command) for the election to be held, the local returning officer fixed the election timetable for the particular constituency or constituencies he was concerned with. Polling in seats with contested elections could continue for many days.

The general election took place between January and February 1835. The first nomination was on 5 January, with the first contest on 6 January and the last contest on 6 February 1835. It was usual for polling in the University constituencies and in Orkney and Shetland to take place about a week after other seats. Disregarding contests in the Universities and Orkney and Shetland, the last poll was on 27 January 1835.

Peel ran a minority Conservative government until 8 April 1835, after being unable to form a majority. Melbourne subsequently became Prime Minister forming a Whig government.

<doc id="446885" wikidata="Q2734868" url="?curid=446885" title="Brierley Hill">
<text>Brierley Hill is a town and electoral ward in the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley, West Midlands, England, south of Dudley and north of Stourbridge. Part of the Black Country and in a heavily industrialised area, it has a population of 13,935 at the 2011 census. It is best known for glass and steel manufacturing, although the industry has declined considerably since the 1970s. One of the largest factories in the area was the Round Oak Steelworks, which closed down and was redeveloped in the 1980s to become the Merry Hill Shopping Centre. Brierley Hill was originally in Staffordshire.

Since 2008, Brierley Hill has been designated as the Strategic Town Centre of the Dudley Borough.

==History==
The name Brierley Hill derives from the Old English words &#x27;brer&#x27;, meaning the place where the Briar Rose grew; &#x27;leah&#x27;, meaning a woodland clearing; and &#x27;hill&#x27;.

Largely a product of the Industrial Revolution, Brierley Hill has a relatively recent history, with the first written records of the town dating back to the 17th century. Originally established as a settlement in the woodland of Pensnett Chase, it began expanding rapidly following the chase&#x27;s enclosure in 1748, and was first recorded on a map in 1785 after the mapping of the Stourbridge Canal.

Brierley Hill had become heavily industrialized by the beginning of the 19th century, with several quarries, collieries, glass works, and iron works emerging. &quot;Pigot and Co.&#x27;s National Commercial Directory for 1828-9&quot; describes Brierley Hill as a hamlet with extensive iron works manufacturing rod, bar and sheet iron, tanks, and boilers.

A National School was opened in the town in 1835, and a market area had developed along the High Street.

By the start of the 20th century, the raw material deposits had become depleted, leading to the closure of many of the industries in the area. The decline in manufacturing resulted in an unemployment rate of 25% in Brierley Hill by the early 1980s, with the closure of the Round Oak Steelworks in December 1982 resulting in a further 1,300 redundancies. The steelworks site, along with the adjacent Merry Hill Farm, were subsequently designated as an Enterprise Zone and were redeveloped to create the Merry Hill Shopping Centre and The Waterfront business park.

In recent years, proposals have been drawn up by the local authority to regenerate Brierley Hill, with the Brierley Hill Regeneration Partnership formed to improve the town over 10 years, by investing in the infrastructure and increasing the number of homes and job opportunities.

Brierley Hill is home to the renowned Bathams brewery on Delph Road. (See article on Daniel Batham &amp; Sons).

===Civic history===
Brierley Hill was originally part of Staffordshire. Brierley Hill was formerly a chapelry in the parish of Kingswinford, on 31 December 1894 Brierley Hill became a separate civil parish, being formed from the part of Kingswinford parish in Brierley Hill urban district, under the Local Government Act 1894. Previously, it had been an urban sanitary authority. The urban district expanded greatly in 1934 after taking in most of the Kingswinford and Quarry Bank districts, and made a failed bid to obtain borough status in 1952. On 1 April 1966 the district was abolished and merged with the County Borough of Dudley, Seisdon Rural District, Municipal borough of Stourbridge, part also went to form the County Borough of Warley. The parish was also abolished on 1 April 1966 and merged with Dudley and Stourbridge, part also went to form Warley. In 1961 the parish had a population of 56,075. It became part of the Dudley Metropolitan Borough in 1974.

==Governance==
Brierley Hill is part of the Dudley Metropolitan Borough, in the West Midlands county in England. The Brierley Hill electoral ward is currently represented by one Labour councillor, Matthew Cook and two Conservative councillors, Adam Davies and Wayne Little on the borough council.

On a national level, the ward forms part of the Dudley South constituency, with the Conservative MP Mike Wood currently elected.

==Places of interest==

The Merry Hill Shopping Centre is located immediately east of Brierley Hill. One of the largest shopping centres in the UK, it was built between 1985 and 1989 on the grounds of Merry Hill Farm, the last working urban farm in the West Midlands.

Round Oak Steelworks was built in 1857 on land overlooking the site of what is now the Merry Hill Centre, and employed up to 3,000 people at its peak, but that figure had fallen to just over 1,200 by the time it closed in December 1982. The adjacent Waterfront office complex was built on the former steelworks site, being developed between 1989 and 1995, although since the onset of the recession in the late 2000s around half of its office units have become empty, with an application for government-funded Enterprise Zone status rejected. The original T.H. Baker store was on the High Street, central to the town since 1888. The store closed in July 2018. The West Bromwich Building Society had intended to relocate to the Waterfront from its previous base in West Bromwich in 2012, although the plan was later shelved.

The art deco former Danilo Cinema opened on Dudley Road in December 1936, with an opening ceremony conducted by George Formby and the young Viscount Ednam, who stepped in when his father, the Earl of Dudley, arrived late.

Brierley Hill Civic Hall, situated on Bank Street in the town centre, hosted several of Slade&#x27;s first concerts during the early 1970s, although none of the members were actually from Brierley Hill.

==Geography==
===Amblecote===
Because Stourbridge has a small postal Sorting Office, Amblecote became part of Brierley Hill, although 2.1 miles away and historically part of Stourbridge ( and still in Stourbridge Constituency )

===Brockmoor===
Brockmoor is situated to the immediate north of the town centre. On the border with Wordsley was the Bottle and Glass Inn, erected on the bank of the Dudley Canal in about 1800 as The Bush. It remained here until 1980 when it was transferred to the Black Country Living Museum as a centrepiece of the then-new village.

St John&#x27;s Church, Brockmoor, is Grade II listed. It was built built in 1844-1845 to designs by Thomas Smith and is predominantly made using Staffordshire blue bricks.

It is also home to Brockmoor Primary School, which has existed at its current site in Belle Isle since 1994. The original school was built in the late 19th century, as an infant school for 5 to 7-year-olds and a junior school for 7 to 11-year-olds; it became a first school for 5–8-year-olds and a middle school for 8 to 12-year-olds in September 1972. However, the two schools merged in September 1989 to form Brockmoor Primary School and a year later the age range was altered to 5 to 11.

===Pensnett===
Pensnett is situated more than a mile north of the town centre and borders the townships of Sedgley, Kingswinford, and Dudley.

===Withymoor Village===
Withymoor Village and Lakeside lie to the south of the town centre bordering Stourbridge and were mostly developed in the 1970s and 1980s, following open cast coalmining. A Sainsbury&#x27;s store is at the centre of the village.

===Chapel Street Estate===
Chapel Street Estate was developed during the 1960s with predominantly multi-storey flats on the site of a Victorian residential area.

===Quarry Bank===
Quarry Bank is situated to the southeast of the town centre and leads to the border with Cradley Heath and Stourbridge. It has a bustling village high street with many independent shops, Church and Stevens Park. Like Amblecote it is part of the Stourbridge constituency.

===Hawbush Estate===
Hawbush Estate stands one mile to the west of the town centre and was developed in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

==Transport==
Brierley Hill is situated along the main A461 road between Stourbridge and Dudley, with other roads providing connections to neighbouring locations. A bypass now diverts the road on a new alignment behind the Asda store rather than through the town centre. It is also served by numerous bus services, with a bus station situated at the Merry Hill Shopping Centre, and several bus stops along the main High Street. Buses from Brierley Hill and Merry Hill provide links to central Dudley, Halesowen, Stourbridge, Walsall, West Bromwich, and Wolverhampton, among others.

From 1850 to 1962, Brierley Hill was served by a railway station for passengers on the Oxford-Worcester-Wolverhampton Line between Dudley Town and Stourbridge Junction, before passenger services were withdrawn. This was before the Beeching Axe came into effect in 1964. The section of line from Stourbridge to Brierley Hill is still in use for goods trains, with a railway steel terminal opening in 1986, but the line northbound to Dudley has been closed since 1993. Currently, the nearest passenger railway station is Cradley Heath, over a mile south-east of the town.

Under current plans, an under-construction extension to the West Midlands Metro will see the railway line north of Brierley Hill re-opened, with light rail services providing a link to the existing Metro line in Wednesbury and Dudley to the north and Stourbridge to the south. Though there is some speculation as to where in Brierley Hill the metro will route, with two suggested options. Number one is that the metro follows the disused South Staffs line. Number two is that the line diverts at Canal Street in Woodside and travels through The Waterfront and then through the Merry Hill Centre before travelling along Brierley Hill High Street, which under current plans may mean that the High Street is pedestrianised.

==Public services==
West Midlands Police have their main Dudley area station in Brierley Hill, situated on the corner of Bank Street, next to the Civic Hall. The police station was originally built in the 1960s as the future local council offices, but the plan was scrapped when Brierley Hill became a part of the Dudley Borough.

There is also a fire station located on Dudley Road, with fire and rescue services provided by the West Midlands Fire Service.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio WM, BBC Radio Shropshire, Heart West Midlands, Smooth West Midlands, Greatest Hits Radio Birmingham &amp; The West Midlands, Capital Midlands, Hits Radio Birmingham, Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire and Black Country Radio, a community based station which broadcast from the town.

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Dudley News&quot;.

==Education==
The town currently has 10 primary schools and one secondary school. Thorns Community College and The Crestwood School are now the town&#x27;s only secondary schools due to the closure of Pensnett High School.

Brierley Hill runs a system of 5 to 7 infant, 7 to 11 junior, and 11 to 16 secondary schools, per the rest of the Dudley borough and the majority of schools in other areas.

However (along with Dudley, Sedgley, and Coseley) it ran a system of 5–8 first, 8–12 middle, and 12–16 secondary schools from 1972 until 1990, before reverting to the traditional age ranges.

==Religion==

The first religious building in Brierley Hill was St. Michael&#x27;s Chapel, which was constructed in 1765 by public subscription. It became a parish church in 1842, covering the areas of Brockmoor, Delph, and Quarry Bank. In 1872, construction commenced on St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church. Designed by E. W. Pugin, it was completed in 1873 and upon completion, consisted of a nave, sanctuary, aisle, and side chapel. There are also Methodist and Baptist churches in the town.

There is also a Chinese Buddhist temple located in Brierley Hill, to cater for the Buddhist community of the Dudley Borough.

<text>The 1832 United Kingdom general election was held on 8 December 1832 to 8 January 1833. The first election to be held in the newly-reformed House of Commons, the Whigs under Earl Grey won a landslide victory with a majority of 224 seats.

Earl Grey, Prime Minister since November 1830, led the first predominantly Whig administration since 1806–07, supported by Radicals and allied politicians, though no formal Liberal Party existed yet. Viscount Althorp led the House of Commons and served as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Tories, led by the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel, had not fully adopted the Conservative label. In Ireland, Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s Irish Repeal Association campaigned for the repeal of the Act of Union, presenting independent candidates.

The election took place from December 1832 to January 1833, with polling staggered across constituencies. The Whigs won an overall majority of 224 seats, 67%, the Tories 27%, and the Repeal Association 6%. The Whigs won 67% of the vote, the Tories 29%, and the Repeal Association 4%. The results varied by region, with the Whigs dominant in Great Britain, but facing stronger Tory opposition in Wales and Ireland.

This was the last election before the Tories formally reconstituted themselves into the Conservatives, and the last time until 1906 that they won fewer than 200 seats.

==Political situation==
The Earl Grey had been prime minister since November 1830. He headed the first predominantly Whig administration since the Ministry of All the Talents in 1806–07.

In addition to the Whigs themselves, Grey was supported by Radical and other allied politicians. The Whigs and their allies were gradually coming to be referred to as liberals, but no formal Liberal Party had been established at the time of this election, so all the politicians supporting the ministry are referred to as Whig in the above results.

The Leader of the House of Commons since 1830 was Viscount Althorp (heir of the Earl Spencer), who also served as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

The last Tory prime minister, at the time of this election, was the Duke of Wellington. After leaving government office, Wellington continued to lead the Tory peers and was the overall Leader of the Opposition.

The Tory Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was Sir Robert Peel, Bt.

John Wilson Croker had used the term &quot;conservative&quot; in 1830, but the Tories at the time of this election had not yet become generally known as the Conservative Party. This distinction would finally take hold after the Liberal Party was officially created.

In Irish politics, Daniel O&#x27;Connell was continuing his campaign for repeal of the Act of Union. He had founded the Irish Repeal Association and it presented candidates independent of the two principal parties.

==Dates of election==
Following the passage of the Reform Act 1832 and related legislation to reform the electoral system and redistribute constituencies, the tenth United Kingdom Parliament was dissolved on 3 December 1832. The new Parliament was summoned to meet on 29 January 1833, for a maximum seven-year term from that date. The maximum term could be and normally was curtailed, by the monarch dissolving the Parliament, before its term expired.

At this period there was not one election day. After receiving a writ (a royal command) for the election to be held, the local returning officer fixed the election timetable for the particular constituency or constituencies he was concerned with. Polling in seats with contested elections could continue for many days.

The general election took place between December 1832 and January 1833. The first nomination was on 8 December, with the first contest on 10 December and the last contest on 8 January 1833. It was usual for polling in the university constituencies and in Orkney and Shetland to take place about a week after other seats. Disregarding contests in the Universities and Orkney and Shetland, the last poll was on 1 January 1833.

==Summary of the constituencies==
For the distribution of constituencies in the unreformed House of Commons, before this election, see the 1831 United Kingdom general election. Apart from the disenfranchisement of Grampound for corruption in 1821 and the transfer of its two seats as additional members for Yorkshire from 1826, there had been no change in the constituencies of England since the 1670s. In some cases the county and borough seats had remained unaltered since the 13th century. Welsh constituencies had been unchanged since the 16th century. Those in Scotland had remained the same since 1708 and in Ireland since 1801.

In 1832 politicians were facing an unfamiliar electoral map, as well as an electorate including those qualified under a new uniform householder franchise in the boroughs. However the reform legislation had not removed all the anomalies in the electoral system.

<text>George Fielden MacLeod, Baron MacLeod of Fuinary, (17 June 1895 – 27 June 1991) was a Scottish soldier and clergyman; he was one of the best known, most influential and unconventional Church of Scotland ministers of the 20th century. He was the founder of the Iona Community on the island of Iona and served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland (1957).

==Early life==
He was born in Glasgow in 1895. His father (Sir John MacLeod) was a successful businessman before entering politics as a Unionist MP; his mother Edith was from a wealthy Lancastrian family (owning cotton mills). From this background and heir to a baronetcy, George MacLeod was educated at Winchester College and Oriel College, Oxford. His paternal grandfather was the highly respected Revd Norman MacLeod of the Barony Church, Glasgow, a Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and Chaplain to Queen Victoria.

==First World War service==
Upon the outbreak of the First World War, and having been a cadet in the Officers Training Corps, MacLeod was commissioned in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, British Army, as a temporary second lieutenant on 19 September 1914. He first saw active service in Greece. After falling ill with dysentery, he was sent back to Scotland to recuperate, after which he was posted to Flanders. On 24 June 1917, he was made an adjutant and promoted to acting captain. He saw action at Ypres and Passchendaele. He was awarded the Military Cross (MC) in October 1917, and the French Croix de Guerre with palm for bravery in 1918.

==Ministry==
His experience of this total war profoundly affected MacLeod, leading him to train for the ministry. He studied divinity at the University of Edinburgh, followed by a year at Union Theological Seminary, New York City (1921-1922). Upon return to Scotland he was invited to become Assistant at St Giles&#x27; Cathedral. During this period he became increasingly concerned over the issue of social inequality in Scotland. In 1924 he was ordained as a Church of Scotland minister, to be Padre of Toc H (Talbot House) in Scotland. Such non-parochial appointments were extremely unusual at the time. Following a disagreement, he resigned from Toc H in 1926, but was invited to become associate minister at St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church, Edinburgh.

His wartime experiences, combined with a profound disillusionment by post-World War I political rhetoric of &quot;a land fit for heroes,&quot; deeply affected him. Confronted by the realities of the depression and unemployment faced by those less privileged than he, MacLeod gradually moved towards supporting socialism and pacifism. From 1937 he became actively involved with the Peace Pledge Union (PPU), and from 1958 with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND).

Meanwhile, in 1930, to considerable surprise, he decided to leave St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church to become minister at Govan Old Parish Church—encountering the considerable social problems caused by poverty in this part of Glasgow. The pace of work took its toll and in 1932 he suffered a breakdown. He spent some time recuperating in Jerusalem in early 1933. While worshipping in an Eastern Orthodox Church on Easter Day he felt a profound spiritual experience, feeling a sense of recovery of the Church as the corporate Body of Christ. This would strongly influence the rest of his life.

He resigned (giving up the financial security of a parish minister&#x27;s stipend) to become the full-time leader of the Iona Community, which he founded in 1938. His efforts started in the early 1930s when he bought Fingleton Mill as a refuge for Glasgow&#x27;s poor. The idea of rebuilding Iona Abbey using ministers, students and unemployed labourers working together influenced his thinking; the Iona Community developed as an international ecumenical community, with offices in Govan and a presence on the island of Iona. Underpinning the fellowship of the Community were four emphases: mission, political involvement, a ministry of healing, and worship, by which MacLeod and the Community sought a way to connect the Church with an industrial age. He led a series of parish missions (sometimes known as a &#x27;Message of Friendship&#x27;) in Scottish parishes associated with the Community, and supported the 1950 Glasgow Churches&#x27; Campaign and the 1950s Tell Scotland Movement. However, he opposed the invitation promoted by Rev. Tom Allan to Dr Billy Graham that led to the 1955 All-Scotland Crusade.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

==Later life==
During World War II, he served as locum minister at Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh—a parish also then afflicted by poverty.

In 1948 (aged 53) he married Lorna; immediately after the wedding they travelled to Australia for a preaching tour. The 1940s and early 1950s were a difficult period professionally. MacLeod was involved in what became known as the &quot;Govan Case.&quot; He was invited by the congregation to return to Govan Old Parish Church in 1948, but the Presbytery of Glasgow refused to approve his appointment, given his wish to continue his active leadership of the Iona Community. The case was referred to the General Assembly; ultimately he was refused permission to combine the two posts.

Despite a feeling of hurt and rejection over the &quot;Govan Case&quot;, MacLeod remained one of the highest-profile figures in the Church of Scotland. In 1957 he was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, following one Commissioner standing up and asking whether it was appropriate that a man who had been described as being &quot;half way to Rome and half way to Moscow&quot; should be Moderator.

On 6 February 1967, MacLeod was awarded a peerage, becoming Baron MacLeod of Fuinary, of Fuinary in Morven in the County of Argyll; the only Church of Scotland minister to have been thus honoured. He was introduced to the House on 15 February 1967. He later became the first peer to represent the Green Party.

From 1968 to 1971, he was Rector of the University of Glasgow. The rector is one of the most senior posts at the University of Glasgow and is elected by the students.

George MacLeod&#x27;s influence on the Church of Scotland was considerable. His initial emphasis on parish mission was generally welcomed and favourably compared to the campaigns of his contemporary, D.P. Thomson. Although dismissed by some as a maverick, he helped to raise awareness of pacificism, ecumenism and social justice issues, and inspired many to become involved with such questions. Through the creation of the Iona Community, he was a pioneer of new forms of ministry (outside more conventional parish or chaplaincy structures).

In 1989 MacLeod received the Templeton Prize.

<doc id="446891" wikidata="Q730103" url="?curid=446891" title="Brownhills">
<text>Brownhills is a historic market and industrial town in the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall of the West Midlands, England. The town is located south of Cannock Chase and close to the large Chasewater reservoir, it is northeast of Walsall, a similar distance southwest of Lichfield and miles north-northwest of Birmingham. It is part of the Aldridge-Brownhills parliamentary constituency and neighbours the villages of Pelsall and Walsall Wood. It lies within the boundaries of the historic county of Staffordshire.

The town lies close to the route of the ancient Watling Street, and although there is no record of its existence before the 17th century, Ogley Hay – a district of the town today – is recorded as a settlement in the Domesday Book. Brownhills quickly grew around the coal-mining industry, especially after the town became linked to the canal and railway networks in the mid-19th century. By the end of the century, Brownhills had grown from a hamlet of only 300 inhabitants to a town of more than , of whom the vast majority were employed in the coal industry. Mining remained the town&#x27;s principal industry until the 1950s; the subsequent closure of the pits led to a severe economic decline that has continued until now. The local authority instituted a regeneration programme in 2007, which was hoped would revive the town&#x27;s fortunes, but there has been little subsequent development.

==History==
Brownhills is on the ancient Watling Street and there is evidence of early settlement in the area, including an ancient burial mound and a guard post believed to date from Roman times and later dubbed Knaves Castle. The name Brownhills, however, is not recorded before the 17th century. The most popular suggestion for the origin of the name is that it refers to the early mining spoil heaps which dotted the area.
The settlement is first recorded (as &quot;Brownhill&quot;) on Robert Plot&#x27;s 1680 map of Staffordshire, at which time it was a hamlet within the manor of Ogley Hay, which in turn was part of the parish of Norton Canes. Ogley Hay itself had existed since at least the 11th century and is mentioned in the Domesday Book, although the 1801 census lists it as having a population of only 8 people. Beyond Ogley Hay lay Catshill, another hamlet which pre-dated Brownhills and which lay within the parish of Shenstone.

During the 17th century, shallow mine workings began to develop in the area, and in 1759 a turnpike was erected in the Catshill area. A local legend claims that Dick Turpin once vaulted the barricade on his horse to avoid paying the toll, although this is demonstrably false as Turpin was executed in 1739, twenty years before the turnpike&#x27;s construction. In 1794 Brownhills (now in the plural) was included in a list of local settlements mentioned in an Act of Parliament concerning canals in Staffordshire, and three years later the Wyrley &amp; Essington Canal, nicknamed the &quot;Curly Wyrley&quot; by the locals due to its winding course, was opened. In 1799 Norton Pool, later to be renamed Chasewater, was created to serve as a reservoir for the canals.

Early in the 19th century, a horse-drawn tram system connected the mines to the wharves on the canal. In response to the growing population of the area open land in Ogley Hay, up until then merely heathland was enclosed and converted to farmland in 1838, the same year in which the area was first declared a parish, although no church was built for another 13 years. Charles Foster Cotterill, a former mayor of Walsall who had purchased the manor of Ogley Hay in 1836 upon the death of former lord Phineas Hussey, saw the potential of the area and sold off large tracts of his land for private farming and the construction of a flour mill and a foundry. The remaining land of the former manor was progressively sold off through a series of indentures of questionable legality until 1846 when Cotterill sold the last and moved to London.

The South Staffordshire Railway reached Brownhills in 1850 and led to a huge expansion of the local mining operation and with it a population explosion in the area, with the population increasing from 305 in 1801 to over 13,000 in 1891. In 1858 a branch line was constructed through the heart of what was then the hamlet of Brownhills, which led to a migration of the population eastwards, leading to the formation of mining slums in the Ogley Hay area. Eventually, a new town centre developed, complete with library and theatre. This led to the gradual amalgamation of Brownhills, Ogley Hay, and Catshill into one town.
Mining was to remain the principal industry of Brownhills until the last pit closed in the 1950s. During the 18th and 19th centuries the area known as Coppice Side was the hub of the mining industry, and the census of 1841 showed that over 80% of the population of the area which makes up modern Brownhills lived and worked there, with up to ten pits active in the area at any one time. As in other mining areas, several men lost their lives in the Brownhills pits. Seven miners, including a boy aged 11, died in an accident in 1861, and in October 1930 an explosion at the Grove Colliery killed fourteen miners, ten of them from Brownhills.

In 1877 the town of Brownhills was officially recognised for the first time after a new Act authorised the amalgamation of rural districts into larger local government areas. An order was issued on 29 September stating:

After the First World War, the Urban District Council, which was based at the Council House and had replaced the District Board in 1894, began a programme of urban improvement. Large areas of open farmland were purchased for the building of council houses, and a notorious slum area, Ogley Square, which had been declared unfit for human habitation, was demolished after a long legal dispute and the tenants rehoused. The final farmland within the boundaries of Brownhills was sold for redevelopment in 1952.

By the time of the Second World War the mines of Brownhills, being amongst the oldest in the area, were largely exhausted, and following the nationalisation of the mining industry the final pit on the Common was closed in the 1950s. Following the demise of the coalfield the town experienced a severe economic slump, with many high street shops closing down. A wave of new development in the 1960s and 1970s saw a new shopping precinct planned, which it was claimed would incorporate a cinema, bowling alley, hotel, and bus station and would completely revitalise the town. Despite the developers&#x27; grandiose claims, the project was not a success and ultimately consisted solely of shopping units, many of which stood empty for up to five years. There was little further development in the 1980s and 1990s, and the feeling of the local council is that the town centre needs improvement. In 2007, the council created a &quot;Townscape Masterplan&quot; for the redevelopment of the town, but more than a decade later the most problematic areas had seen little redevelopment.

==Governance==

Brownhills is represented by two tiers of government, Walsall Borough Council (&quot;local&quot;) and UK Parliament (&quot;national&quot;).

The Brownhills District established in 1877 remained in existence until 1894 when it was superseded by Brownhills Urban District. In 1966 the Urban District merged with that of Aldridge to form the Aldridge-Brownhills Urban District, in accordance with a recommendation of the Local Government Commission for England. The district was amalgamated in 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, into the newly formed Metropolitan Borough of Walsall, under whose jurisdiction the area remains to this day. As a result of this amalgamation Brownhills also became part of the West Midlands county, having previously been part of Staffordshire. Today Brownhills constitutes a ward within the Borough of Walsall and has three seats on the Borough Council. As at the 2019 local elections two of these seats were held by the Conservative Party and one by Labour.

Wendy Morton, representing the Conservative Party, has been the Member of Parliament for the constituency of Aldridge-Brownhills since 2015. Before the creation of the Aldridge-Brownhills seat in 1974, the town had been part of the Walsall North constituency since 1955, when it had been transferred from the now-defunct Cannock constituency.

Brownhills was part of the Walsall council counting area of the West Midlands European Parliament constituency, which elected seven MEPs to the European Parliament. In the 2019 election the Brexit Party gained 42.7% of the vote in this counting area, followed by Labour with 21.5%.

==Geography==
Brownhills is located at on the edge of Cannock Chase and lies mostly at a height of approximately 150 metres (492 ft) above sea level, although there is a sharp incline to nearly 180 metres (590 ft) at the eastern end of the town. The highest point of Cannock Chase, standing at 244 metres (801 ft) above sea level, lies approximately from the town. Although a small river called Crane Brook flows slightly to the east of Brownhills, the only significant bodies of water in the area are human-made, namely the canal and the reservoir Chasewater, which lies to the north, between Brownhills and Cannock Chase. The reservoir was constructed in the 18th century and reshaped by reclamation schemes as recently as the 1970s.
Immediately to the west of the town is Brownhills Common, a heathland which once formed part of Cannock Forest (also known as &quot;Canke Wood&quot;). Although the forest was felled in the 15th and 16th centuries, the spread of heather and the grazing of sheep led to the creation of a huge area of heathland. The area was affected by mine workings but has now returned to a more natural state, and lizards and dragonflies may be observed. The area now supports various habitat types, with the heathland mixing with marshy grassland, with scattered scrub and pools. In 1926, when ownership of the Common was transferred to the local Council, a large area of barren land at the eastern end, closest to the town, was landscaped, with new trees planted. Lying south of the Common, Birch Coppice is a large area of predominantly oak and birch woodland, which, although crossed by a now-dismantled railway line, mostly escaped the destruction caused to other wooded areas by mining and other industry.
To the south, Brownhills is separated from the nearby village of Clayhanger by Clayhanger Common, which is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest and considered &quot;one of the best wetland sites in the county&quot;. In 2007, a new £445,000 bridge was erected across the canal at Brownhills, providing pedestrian, disabled and cycling access to the Common and to the village of Clayhanger beyond. To the east lies the village of Stonnall and a large area of green belt land.

The geology of Brownhills comprises mainly red clay marl overlying Triassic sandstone and deposits of coal. The town is on several fault lines, the main one being the Vigo Fault, a branch of the larger Eastern Boundary Fault, which runs from Birmingham to Rugeley. On the western side of the fault, in the area of Brownhills Common, the marl is over thinner than on the eastern side, bringing the coal seams significantly closer to the surface. The presence of the faults and the effects of mining mean that subsidence has been a major problem in the area for many years.

Since the 19th century, trade in Brownhills has been centred on the High Street. As the canal and Clayhanger Common lie immediately to the south of the High Street, the town&#x27;s housing areas are mainly to the north and at the eastern and western ends of the town. In 2011, Brownhills had 5,173 residential dwellings, of which 49.4% were semi-detached houses. In late 2020 the average selling price of a domestic property in the town was £182,700, compared to £112,000 ten years earlier, a rise of 63%. Two housing associations, Walsall Housing Group (whg) and WATMOS Housing Co-operative (WATMOS), manage those properties formerly owned as council houses by Walsall Council.

==Economy==

At the 2011 census, 5,769 people in Brownhills were employed, with the largest percentages in retail (19.8%) and manufacturing (15.8%). This represented a shift from a decade earlier, when manufacturing had been the largest sector, employing 28.5% of the workforce. In 2011, 2.7% of usual residents aged 16 to 74 were classified as long-term unemployed.

The decline of the mining industry in the 1950s caused a severe economic slump in Brownhills. In 2007, the local authority created a &quot;Townscape Masterplan&quot; for the regeneration of Brownhills, which involved increased leisure provision, the improvement of the town centre&#x27;s shopping facilities, a new transport interchange incorporating Park and Ride facilities and cycle links to the town centre and the National Cycle Route, and the refurbishment of run-down properties. The plan involved the potential construction of a bypass to relieve the heavily congested High Street. Among the areas highlighted for redevelopment was the Ravens Court shopping precinct. After many years of legal wranglings, including the collapse of a plan to build a supermarket on the site, a planning application was submitted in 2017, but by late 2018 the precinct was still disused and a frequent target for anti-social behaviour.

The headquarters of the One Stop convenience store chain, a subsidiary of Tesco plc, is located in the town. Brownhills was formerly home to the wirings manufacturer Electrium&#x27;s last UK-based factory, but this has closed, with manufacturing shifted overseas and commercial staff moved to a new site in Cannock. 

==Transport==

===Roads and bus===
Brownhills is served by the A5 and lies close to a junction of the M6 Toll motorway. National Express West Midlands bus services 936, 937, 937A connect the town with Kingstanding, Perry Barr and Birmingham. They also operate service 8 linking Brownhills with Walsall, Burntwood and Lichfield. Chaserider operates service 3 to Norton Canes and Cannock. Previously this was operated by Arriva and extended to Walsall vis the current service 8 route.

===Railway===
Brownhills formerly had two railway stations. The first, on the South Staffordshire Line (later part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway), opened in 1849 but was closed as part of the Beeching Axe in 1965. The line remained open for freight until 1983, but the track was lifted in 1987. The other, on the Midland Railway, was open for passengers between 1884 and 1930 and for freight until 1960, when the track was lifted. Andy Street, the Mayor of the West Midlands, put forward a 20-year plan for the improvement of the region&#x27;s transport infrastructure in 2020 which included the re-opening of a station in Brownhills.

===Canals===
The Birmingham Canal Navigations&#x27; Wyrley and Essington Canal passes through Brownhills and meets the Daw End Branch Canal at Catshill Junction. The Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust has been involved in restoring the Lichfield Canal since its formation in 1988 and, in 2003, created an aqueduct over the M6 Toll road near Brownhills.

==Education==
The town&#x27;s main secondary school is Brownhills Ormiston Academy (formerly Brownhills Sports College, Brownhills Community Technology College, Brownhills Community School and Brownhills Comprehensive), a mixed-gender school with approximately pupils, which is part of the Ormiston Academies Trust. In 2019, the school&#x27;s progress 8 benchmark score was ranked &quot;below average&quot;.

Watling Street Primary School, situated on the A5 at the western end of town, has approximately 200 students between the ages of 3 and 11 as of 2021. In 2019, 77% of its Key Stage 2 pupils were deemed to have met the expected standard. There are four other primary schools in the town: St James&#x27; Primary School, St Bernadette&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, Brownhills West Primary School, Millfield Primary School and one in Clayhanger, Holy Trinity Church of England Primary School.

==Religious sites==

Brownhills has a Church of England church (St James), a Roman Catholic church (St Bernadette), two Methodist churches (including one in Clayhanger), two Spiritualist Churches, and a Pentecostal church. Brownhills has had strong links with the Methodist faith since the 19th century. The current Silver Street Methodist church was built in the 1960s when two other churches were compulsorily purchased and demolished due to their sites being identified as prime locations for additional town-centre car parking under a council redevelopment scheme.

==Culture==

===Attractions and landmarks===

One of Brownhills&#x27; most prominent landmarks is a stainless steel sculpture of a coal miner, erected in May 2006 on a roundabout at one end of the High Street, where the A4124 Pelsall Road and High Street A452 cross. The colossal sculpture, by John McKenna ARBS, commemorates the town&#x27;s mining tradition. A competition was organised to choose an official nickname for the statue. The winning name was Jigger after Jack &quot;Jigger&quot; Taylor who died when the roof of Walsall Wood pit collapsed in 1951. The town is also home to what is reputed to be the oldest fingerpost in the United Kingdom.

Chasewater in Staffordshire lies on the edge of Brownhills, with the area surrounding it, which is designated as a country park, officially falling within the Brownhills postal area. The reservoir supports a variety of activities including water-skiing, sailing, angling and bird watching. The Chasewater Railway operates a heritage rail service on the line of the former mineral railway around Chasewater between Brownhills and Chasetown, north of the former Brownhills Watling Street station. The railway&#x27;s main station is designated Brownhills West.

On the opposite side of the A5, Brownhills Common, where a wide variety of birds can be observed, is a designated nature reserve, as is Shire Oak Park, approximately from the town centre. Holland Park, on the edge of the Common, has a skate park and multi-sports area, which were created as part of a £95,000 environmental regeneration project and opened in 2002.

===Cultural events and venues===

One of the major concerns of the local council in 2007 was that the town was &quot;particularly lacking in leisure provision&quot;. At one time the town had two cinemas, but the last of these closed in the 1960s and a plan to build a new one never came to fruition. Although the town&#x27;s theatre had closed down many years prior, the Brownhills Academy&#x27;s theatre has staged productions by local groups such as the Aldridge Musical Comedy Society and the Walsall Gilbert and Sullivan Society.

Brownhills holds an annual canal festival in June with stalls, entertainment and boat trips, and there is an active Community Association which organises a range of events and activities. The town had a weekly market for many years, but it closed down in 2010 due to lack of traders and the site was subsequently redeveloped for housing.

Brownhills has several public houses. Although some older ones, such as the Victorian-era Jolly Collier in Coppice Side, were demolished in the 1980s, several dating from the 19th century still stand comparatively unchanged, including the Shoulder of Mutton, which still bears windows etched with the emblem of the brewery which owned it in the 1850s. The Station Hotel in the High Street hosted concerts, including an appearance by Black Sabbath in 1968.

===Sport===

Brownhills does not have a Saturday men&#x27;s football team; in the 1990s Brownhills Town F.C. competed in the Midland Football Combination but folded during the 2003–04 season. During the 1950s Ogley Hay F.C. were a strong local team, reaching the final of the Walsall Senior Cup on three occasions. Brownhills Community Colts Football Club fields teams in various age groups up to under-17.

The Brownhills Canoe and Outdoor Centre opened in 2006, funded by British Waterways with the assistance of partners such as Sport England, the European Regional Development Fund and Walsall Council, and offers canoeing and kayaking lessons on the canal, close to the centre of town. Nearby Chasewater is a prominent watersports site, with the Watersports Centre offering a variety of water skiing facilities, and the sailing club providing year-round windsurfing and dinghy sailing.

===Media===
Brownhills has no dedicated local newspaper, but is covered by newspapers published in Wolverhampton and Walsall. The most popular paid-for local newspaper is the &quot;Express &amp; Star&quot;. Free newspapers with significant circulation in the town include the &quot;Walsall Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Walsall Advertiser&quot;, and &quot;Walsall Observer&quot;. Similarly, the town has no dedicated local radio station but receives the stations broadcast from the Sutton Coldfield transmitting station.

<text>Buntingford is a market town and civil parish in the district of East Hertfordshire and county of Hertfordshire in England. It lies next to the River Rib and is located on the historic Roman road, Ermine Street. As a result of its location, it grew mainly as a staging post with many coaching inns and has an 18th-century one-cell prison known as The Cage, by the ford at the end of Church Street. It has a population of 7,879, as of the 2021 UK census.

== Name ==
Despite popular belief, the name of Buntingford does not come from the bunting bird. Instead, it probably originates from the Saxon chieftain or tribe Bunta and the local ford running over the River Rib. Buntingford was the name of the ford and its surrounding areas, with Bunting being the name of a village located six miles to its north, which is translated from Old English as &quot;place or people of Bunta&quot;. The earliest forms of the name Buntingford are &quot;Buntas Ford&quot; and &quot;Buntingeford&quot;, both of which date back to 1185. The modern form &quot;Buntingford&quot; dates back to 1255. This roughly translates to &quot;Ford of the people of Bunta&quot;.

== History ==
Buntingford was first recorded in an 1185 Knights Templar land document. Henry III designated it a market town by royal charter in 1253. Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster, relocated her market in Chipping to Buntingford in 1360, under permission from Edward III. She then gave the market to the town&#x27;s residents, turning it into one of England&#x27;s first community owned markets.

Buntingford was located traditionally within the parish of Layston – St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church (Layston), previously derelict and now a house, lies about half a mile to the north-east of the town. St Peter&#x27;s Church, formerly a relief chapel, is the Anglican church in Buntingford and is an almost unique brick building from the age of the 17th-century Puritans. St Richard&#x27;s serves the Roman Catholic community. There is also a United Reformed Church in Baldock Road.
Queen Elizabeth I is claimed to have stayed at Buntingford in a building now called the Bell House Gallery, on a coach journey to Cambridge. Just up the High Street, &quot;The Angel Inn&quot;, now a dental surgery, was a staging post for coaches travelling from London to Cambridge. The town has an annual firework display at The Bury, presented by Buntingford Town Football Club. The Prime Meridian passes to the east of Buntingford. The town has many Georgian and medieval buildings, such as Buntingford almshouses, Buntingford Manor House and the Red House. Buntingford was a stop-over on what was the main route between London and Cambridge, now the A10.

== Governance ==
Buntingford is in East Hertfordshire, a shire district in the county of Hertfordshire, and the parliamentary constituency of North East Hertfordshire (formerly North Hertfordshire), a Conservative safe seat represented by Sir Oliver Heald since 1992. Previously, between 1983 and 1997, Buntingford was located in the constituency of Hertford and Stortford, which at the time was represented by Conservative Bowen Wells.

Hertfordshire has three-tier local government, meaning responsibilities for local government are split between county councils, district councils, and parish councils (including town councils). Buntingford is managed by Buntingford Town Council, East Hertfordshire District Council and Hertfordshire County Council. Buntingford is represented on the district council by Stan Bull and Jeff Jones of the Buntingford Conservatives, the local branch of the Conservative Party founded in 2015. Jones also represents Buntingford in the county council. The district and county councils are headquartered in Hertford, while the town council is headquartered in Buntingford. The town council is based from Buntingford Manor House and elects councillors every four years. The Town Clerk is currently Jill Jones and the Town Council Officer is currently Alexander Georgiou. Town Mayor Graham Waite was elected in 2018 and is serving with his deputy, Steve Bowman.

Before the creation of East Hertfordshire on 1 April 1974, Buntingford was part of the Braughing Rural District, which was abolished on 31 March 1974. The district was headquartered in Buntingford and Bishop&#x27;s Stortford and was formed from the merger of the Hadham and Buntingford Rural Districts on 1 April 1935. Buntingford Rural District evolved from Buntingford Rural Sanitary District, existing between 28 December 1894 and 31 March 1935.

==Culture==
Market day is Monday, and early closing Wednesday. The Buntingford Cougars (youth grassroots) Football Tournament is held every year at The Bury, drawing in teams from around the area. There is also a classic car show held in the town each year, on the first Saturday in September. The town has a number of public houses – &quot;The Fox and Duck&quot;, &quot;The Black Bull&quot;and &quot;The Crown&quot;. The &#x27;World Sausage Tossing Championship&#x27; has taken place at &quot;The Countryman Inn&quot;, in Chipping near Buntingford, every August since 2014.

==Transport==
Buntingford railway station, opened in 1863, was closed
in 1964, under the Beeching cuts. This was the terminus for the Buntingford Branch Line. Recently it has been redeveloped into housing.

Current public transport provision consists of an hourly bus service, route 331 to Hertford operated by Arriva Herts &amp; Essex.

==Economy==
Buntingford is home to various independent shops, restaurants and pubs mainly located in the town&#x27;s high street. Buntingford has a Co-op food supermarket and a Sainsbury&#x27;s Local. Just outside the town are two fuel stations one at each end of the bypass. One is operated by BP, the other by Esso that opened in 2022. The town was previously home to the Sainsbury&#x27;s Anglia Distribution Centre, but this was vacated and eventually knocked down for housing in 2014. The site had previously been used as a Royal Army Ordnance Corps munitions factory, known locally as &quot;the Dump&quot;. Team BMR and Triple Eight Racing, two major UK auto racing teams, were based in the town.

== Education ==
Buntingford is one of two towns in Hertfordshire using a three-tier school system (the other being Royston). In this system, children are educated in first schools until they enter middle school in Year Five, after which they join upper school in Year Nine, remaining there until the completion of sixth form. This system was enacted in Buntingford in 1969 by order of the county council.

=== First and middle schools ===
There is currently one middle school and two first schools, with a third opening in September 2023:

* Layston Church of England First School is a mixed Church of England first school with voluntary controlled status, situated at The Causeway, Buntingford. It is under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of St Albans and was preceded by two schools: Buntingford National School for Boys and Adams&#x27; Memorial School for Girls &amp; Infants, opening in 1845 and 1879 respectively. Layston has had an Ofsted grading of outstanding since 2009 and has a pupil population of 149, with a capacity for 150.
* Millfield First and Nursery School is a mixed community first school with nursery education, situated at Monks Walk, Buntingford. The school has had an Ofsted grading of outstanding since 2009 and has a pupil population of 341, with a capacity for 352. Animals, including a dog, are included in the school&#x27;s staff team.
* Buntingford First School (BFS) is a new mixed first school with academy status that was first planned to open on the grounds of Edwinstree C of E Middle School in September 2022, before moving to its own building at London Road, Buntingford, in Easter 2023. It will now open in September 2023 in its own building. The school is part of the Scholars Education Trust and is expected to be Hertfordshire&#x27;s first net zero school. It will have a pupil capacity of 300.
* Edwinstree Church of England Middle School is Buntingford&#x27;s only middle school. It is a mixed Church of England voluntary controlled school situated at Norfolk Road, Buntingford, under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of St Albans. Edwinstree has had an Ofsted grading of good since 2018, previously being graded as requiring improvement since 2016 and, before that, outstanding since 2008. It has a pupil population of 477, with a capacity for 480.

=== Secondary education ===

Buntingford currently has one upper school, Freman College (formerly Ward Freman School). The school is a mixed upper school and sixth form with academy status, situated at Bowling Green Lane, Buntingford, under the control of its own single-academy trust. It was established in either 1970 or 1971 as an 11 to 16 comprehensive school, replacing the Buntingford Secondary Modern School which was established between both world wars. It was named after Bishop Seth Ward and Elizabeth Freman of the Freman family as both were benefactors of Buntingford&#x27;s old grammar school that closed in 1900. Previously a foundation school, Freman converted to academy status in 2011, being one of the first schools to do so. It has had an Ofsted grading of good since 2006 and has a student population of 961, with a capacity for 903.

A grade II listed house situated at Layston Court 20, High Street, was formerly used as the building and master&#x27;s house for Buntingford Grammar School until 1877. Buntingford Grammar School was Buntingford&#x27;s first secondary school, having been built by its endower, Elizabeth Freman, between 1630 and 1633 for 25 schoolboys and a master. It was a two-storey building, with the attic being added at a later date sometime before 1830. The school was endowed again in 1684 by former pupil Seth Ward, who had become the Bishop of Salisbury, and Lady Jane Barkham. After its disuse in 1877, the building was modified into a house. The Town Council took ownership of the rest of the school&#x27;s site and have preserved it as a park. The school itself survived elsewhere until 1900.

<doc id="446905" wikidata="Q610238" url="?curid=446905" title="Gillingham, Kent">
<text>Gillingham ( ) is a town in Kent, England, which forms a conurbation with neighbouring Chatham, Rochester, Strood and Rainham. It is the largest town in the borough of Medway and in 2020 had a population of 108,785.

==Etymology==
Gillingham&#x27;s name is Old English in origin and means &quot;the homestead of Gylla&#x27;s people&quot;. The names of Gillingham in Dorset and Gillingham in Norfolk have the same etymology, despite the differing pronunciation.

==Status==
Gillingham became an urban district under the Local Government Act 1894, gaining municipal borough status in 1903. John Robert Featherby was the first mayor of the Borough of Gillingham. In 1928 Rainham was added to the Gillingham Borough. Under the Local Government Act 1972 it became a non-metropolitan district which also covered Hempstead, Wigmore and Rainham. This district was abolished in 1998 before it merged with the other Medway Towns (in the City of Rochester-upon-Medway district) under the 1990s UK local government reform, to become part of the Medway unitary authority.

===Town hall===
The Municipal Buildings in Canterbury Street were built as council offices for Gillingham Borough Council. They were opened by the Lord Mayor of London, Sir George Broadbridge, on 25 September 1937. The Lord Mayor was received at Gillingham Railway Station by a guard of honour of boys of HMS &quot;Arethusa&quot;. Before the Second World War, air raid sirens were placed on the Municipal Buildings, and the local Civil Defence headquarters were in a single-storey building, to the rear of the car park. In about 1953, beneath part of the car park, Gillingham Borough Control Centre was built underground.

When Gillingham Borough Council later merged with Rochester upon Medway to form the unitary Medway Authority in 1998, the buildings were still used as council offices and for meetings for several years afterwards. Later, Medway Council then moved into the former Lloyd&#x27;s of London headquarters at Chatham Gun Wharf, and the Municipal Buildings were considered surplus to requirements. They were sold off in 2008 under a contract which turned them into a residential care home.

==Geography==
The town grew along the road from Brompton on the great lines (military barracks), to the railway station. As such it was a linear development. Close by was the road along the shore line, linking The Strand, and the tiny village of Gillingham Green. Later, communities developed along the top road - Watling Street – turnpike linking Chatham with Dover. All these communities merged into the town that is called today Gillingham.

===Climate===
Gillingham experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) similar to almost all of the United Kingdom. Due to its southerly, sheltered, marine position near the European continent the climate is among the warmest in the whole of England.

==History==
The name Gillingham is recorded in the Domesday book of 1086. It is said to have been named after a warlord, Gyllingas—from the old English &quot;gyllan&quot;, meaning &quot;to shout&quot;. He was a notable man in Kent history as he led his warriors into battle screaming and shouting. At the time of the Norman Conquest, Gillingham was given to the half-brother of William I of England, Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, who rebuilt the parish church at Gillingham and constructed an Archbishop&#x27;s Palace on land bordered by Grange Road, the ruins of which could still be seen in the last century. At the time Gillingham itself was a small hamlet, built around the parish church and surrounded by large farm-holdings, of which St. Mark&#x27;s Parish formed part, being part of Brittain Farm.

William Adams mentioned Gillingham in his writings, saying: &quot;... two English miles from Rochester and one mile from Chatham, where the King&#x27;s ships do lie&quot;. Adams was baptised at Gillingham Parish Church on 24 September 1564.

 The Strand was once owned by the Davenport family in 1635, the Davenport family included a Mayor of Gillingham, pie makers and key holders of Gillingham. The Davenport family had a road named after them in 1920. The Davenport estate was in Ashford, Kent. The estate comprised around 15000 acres and was called The Davenport Manor. The Davenports lost the estate in 1889. The Davenport family were among the investors in the Chatham Dockyard.
In medieval times the part of Gillingham known as Grange was a limb of the Cinque Ports and the maritime importance of the area continued until the late 1940s. Indeed, a large part of Chatham Dockyard lay within Gillingham, and when it was closed in 1984, two-thirds of the then modern-day dockyard lay within the boundaries of Gillingham. The dockyard was founded by Queen Elizabeth I on the site of the present gun wharf, the establishment being transferred to the present site about 1622. In 1667 a Dutch fleet sailed up the River Medway and, having landed at Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey and laying siege to the fort at Sheerness, invaded Gillingham in what became known as the raid on the Medway. The Dutch eventually retreated, but the incident caused great humiliation to the Royal Navy.

The Seven Years&#x27; War began in 1756 and the government immediately gave orders for the defence of the dockyard; by 1758 the Chatham Lines of Defence were built. Over a mile long, they stretched across the neck of the dockyard peninsula, from Chatham Reach, south of the dockyard, across to Gillingham Reach on the opposite side. One of the redoubts on the Lines was at Amherst. The batteries faced away from the dockyard itself to forestall an attack from the landward side; the ships and shore-mounted guns on the river were considered sufficient to protect from that side. The lines of defence are now part of the Great Lines Heritage Park and also the Lower Lines Park (near MidKent College, Gillingham Campus).

War with France began again in 1778, and once more it was necessary to strengthen the defences. Fort Amherst was the first to be improved; it was followed by work beginning in 1800 to add others at Fort Pitt, Chatham, plus Fort Delce and Fort Clarence (both in Rochester); later in the 19th century others were added, including one at Fort Darland in Gillingham. This work, and the expansion of the dockyard, meant that more homes were needed for the workers. The position of the Lines meant that this building could only happen beyond, and so New Brompton came into being. The population rose to 9,000 people by 1851.

Gillingham was still only a small village; eventually it, too, was swallowed up, and the name of the whole settlement changed to Gillingham. In the 1891 census its population was 27,809, and in 1901, it was 42,530.

In 1919, after World War I, a naval war memorial in the shape of a white stone obelisk was set up on the Great Lines. Additional structures were added in 1945 to commemorate the dead of World War II. Similar monuments stand in the dockyard towns of Portsmouth and Plymouth.

===Disasters===
Gillingham has been the scene of two notable disasters: on 11 July 1929 a public demonstration by Gillingham Fire Brigade went wrong, resulting in 15 fatalities; and in the 1951 Gillingham bus disaster, 24 Royal Marine cadets aged 10 to 13 were killed in a road accident.

==Economy==

The main source of employment was at Chatham Dockyard, two-thirds of which lay within the boundaries of Gillingham. When it ceased to be a naval base in 1984, there was significant unemployment. A World Heritage Site application has been made for the Dockyard and its defences. Since the 1980s, Gillingham has rebuilt its economic base and the &quot;Gillingham Business Park&quot; was set up from the town centre, to attract investments and diversify economic activity. The business park and ice rink were an early commission for Grimshaw Architects.

Gillingham has a marina called &quot;Gillingham Marina&quot;. Gillingham is an important retail centre serving a substantial part of Medway. The town has a large street market in the High Street on Saturdays and Mondays, and is the busiest in the whole of Medway.

==Transport==

===Roads===

The Roman road now known as Watling Street passes through Gillingham; and until the opening of the Medway Towns bypass (the M2 motorway) in the mid-1960s the same route was followed by the traffic on the A2 to Dover. That road had been turnpiked in 1730, as part of the London–Canterbury coaching route.

In June 1996 the Medway Tunnel opened, giving Gillingham a second link to the M2 and Strood.

===Railways===

The London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway opened its line between Chatham and Faversham on 25 January 1858; and a country station was opened here called New Brompton. This was to serve the dockyard labourers&#x27; homes that had sprung up during the Napoleonic Wars. A branch line led into the dockyard. The station later became Gillingham railway station.

Services improved significantly when in July 1939, Gillingham became the terminus of the electrified system of the Southern Railway.

===Trams===
Gillingham was served by an electric tram system operated by the Chatham and District Light Railways Company from 1902 to 1930.

==Culture==
===Library===
Gillingham Public Library is located in the High Street.

===Sport===
The town is home to Gillingham F.C., who play at Priestfield Stadium and were first elected to the Football League in 1920 as members of the new Football League Third Division (south). They were voted out of the league in 1938, only to be re-elected when the league expanded in 1950. They spent the next 50 years moving between the two lower divisions before finally reaching the second tier (then Division One) in the 1999–2000 season after beating Wigan Athletic in the Play-Off Final at Wembley. They spent five years at this level before being relegated twice, and in 2013-22 played in League One (third tier), into which they were promoted after winning their first championship for fifty years in the 2012–13 season under manager Martin Allen. They were relegated to EFL League Two in 2022.

The area boasts a sub-regional sports centre (the Black Lion Leisure Centre, now Medway Park) with three indoor pools for swimming and SCUBA diving, gym, sports hall and squash courts also in the same area is Jumpers Rebound Centre for trampolining a world-famous facility for the sport.

There is an outdoors sporting centre located at the Strand which provides sailing and motor boat courses for both adults and children. The Strand Leisure Park has an open-air swimming pool on the banks of the River Medway as well as other leisure attractions including tennis courts and a narrow-gauge railway.

Gillingham Ice Bowl is the home ice rink for Kent&#x27;s premier Ice Hockey Club, the Invicta Dynamos, who were originally called the Medway Bears. The Ice Bowl was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1984.

====Modern Pentathlon World Cup 2010====

See List of schools in Medway for a full list of schools serving Gillingham and the Medway area.

==Religion==

Within Gillingham there are many churches from different Christian denominations. There are three Church of England churches: the historic parish church of St. Mary Magdalene; the evangelical St. Mark&#x27;s; and St. Augustine&#x27;s. There are also Baptist, Methodist and Roman Catholic churches.

The Parish Church of St Mary Magdalene (&quot;The Church on the Green&quot;,) is the oldest building in Gillingham and Grade II* Listed.
The Normans built the church in the early 13th century, then in the 15th century a tower was added. More extensions were added during the 14th century. In 1700, Philip Wightman was commissioned to cast and hang a ring of five bells, to the tower. Then in 1737, Richard Phelps added another bell to complete a ring of six. Edward Hasted refers to it in 1798, &#x27;three isles and three chancels, with a handsome tower steeple at the west end&#x27;. In 1811, Thomas Mears added two treble bells to make eight. In 1868, architect Sir Arthur Blomfield restored the church and tower and to mark the completion of the restoration, the firm of Heaton, Butler and Bayne replaced the stained glass in the east window, based on a design by Henry Holiday.
In 1896, Our Lady of Gillingham Roman Catholic Church was built close to Saint Mary Magdalene Church, and overlooks the River Medway.

It followed after other Roman Catholic churches in the area, the closest, St Michael&#x27;s in Chatham (built 1863). Our Lady of Gillingham was built on the town of New Brompton, as Gillingham was then called, to mainly cater for the new workforce – those employed at Chatham Dockyard. The church itself was started in 1890, and was completed by 1896, being opened on 12 May 1896.

A local Roman Catholic school was established on the site of the church in 1894. The schoolrooms were used until 1972, when the infant section of the school relocated to nearby Greenfield Road. In 1988, after more building work on the new site, the whole school was reunited on its new site at Greenfield Road. The Church (Our Lady of Gillingham) celebrated its centenary in May 1996, two years after the local school.

Gillingham also has the Jāmi’ah mosque and a Hindu Sabha Mandir.

James Jershom Jezreel, founder of the Jezreelite sect which flourished in the area during the 19th century, began the building of Jezreel&#x27;s Tower on Chatham Hill. The tower was never completed but stood until its demolition in 1961. There is still a Jezreels Road off Watling Street. The tower was painted by Tristram Hillier in 1937 as part of a series of posters for Royal Dutch Shell. A copy is held in Tate Britain.

==Military==
Brompton Barracks have long been the home of the Royal Engineers. Today Gillingham is home to the Royal Engineers Museum.

<text>Benjamin Crowninshield Bradlee (, 1921 – , 2014) was an American journalist who served as managing editor and later as executive editor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, from 1965 to 1991. He became a public figure when the &quot;Post&quot; joined &quot;The New York Times&quot; in publishing the Pentagon Papers and gave the go-ahead for the paper&#x27;s extensive coverage of the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. He was also criticized for editorial lapses when the &quot;Post&quot; had to return a Pulitzer Prize in 1981 after it discovered that its award-winning story was false.

After his retirement, Bradlee continued to be associated with the &quot;Post&quot;, holding the position of Vice President at-large until his death. In retirement, Bradlee was an advocate for education and the study of history, including his role as a trustee on the boards of several major educational, historical, and archaeological research institutions.

==Early life and education==
Ben Bradlee was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Frederick Josiah Bradlee, Jr., who was from the Boston Brahmin Bradlee family and who was an investment banker, and Josephine de Gersdorff, daughter of a Wall Street lawyer. His great uncle was Frank Crowninshield, founder and first editor of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.

Bradlee was the second of three children; his siblings were older brother Frederick, a writer and Broadway stage actor, and younger sister Constance. The children grew up in a wealthy family with domestic staff. They learned French from governesses, took piano and riding lessons, and went to the symphony and the opera; but the stock market crash of 1929 cost Bradlee&#x27;s father his job, and he took on whatever work he could find to support his family, including selling deodorants and molybdenum mining stock &quot;for companies founded and financed by some of his rich pals&quot;, according to his son Ben Bradlee. His father&#x27;s career opportunities improved later, serving as a financial consultant to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and being appointed to the Massachusetts State Parole Board in 1945, of which he was president for ten years until his retirement in 1957.

With the help of wealthy relatives, Bradlee was able to continue his education at Dexter School, and to finish high school at St. Mark&#x27;s School, where he played varsity baseball. At St. Mark&#x27;s he contracted polio, but sufficiently recovered to walk without limping. He attended Harvard College, where his father had been a star football player, and graduated in 1942 with a combined Greek–English major.

==World War II service==
Like many of his classmates, Bradlee anticipated the United States would eventually enter World War II and enrolled in the Naval ROTC at Harvard. As a result, he received his naval commission on the same day he graduated. He was assigned to the Office of Naval Intelligence, and served as a communications officer in the Pacific. He was assigned to the destroyer USS &quot;Philip&quot; based off the shore of Guam and arriving at Guadalcanal with the Second Transport Group, part of Task Group 62.4, commanded by Rear Admiral Norman Scott. Bradlee&#x27;s main battles were Vella Lavella, Saipan, Tinian, and Bougainville. He also fought in the biggest naval battle ever fought, the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines Campaign, in the Borneo Campaign, and made every landing in the Solomon Islands campaign.

==Early career in journalism==
At loose ends after the war, Bradlee was recruited by a high school classmate in 1946 to work at the &quot;New Hampshire Sunday News&quot;, a new Sunday paper in Manchester, New Hampshire. The paper struggled to develop advertising revenue and circulation for two years, but was finally sold to the &quot;Manchester Union-Leader&quot;, the competing daily newspaper. Bradlee appealed to family friends for job leads, and gained interviews at both &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. According to Bradlee, when the train arrived in Baltimore it was raining, so he stayed on the train to Washington and was hired by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as a reporter. He got to know associate publisher Phil Graham, who was the son-in-law of the publisher, Eugene Meyer. On , 1950, Bradlee was alighting from a streetcar in front of the White House just as two Puerto Rican nationalists attempted to shoot their way into Blair House in an attempt to kill President Harry S. Truman. In 1951, Bradlee became assistant press attaché in the American embassy in Paris. In 1954, Bradlee took on a new job as European correspondent for &quot;Newsweek&quot;. He remained overseas for another four years until he was transferred to &quot;Newsweek&#x27;s&quot; Washington D.C. bureau. 
As a reporter in the 1950s, Bradlee became close friends with then-senator John F. Kennedy, who had graduated from Harvard two years before Bradlee, and lived nearby. In 1960, Bradlee toured with both Kennedy and Richard Nixon in their presidential campaigns. He later wrote a book, &quot;Conversations With Kennedy&quot; (W.W. Norton, 1975), recounting their relationship during those years. Bradlee was, at this point, Washington Bureau chief for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, a position from which he helped negotiate the sale of the magazine to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; holding company.

==Career at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;==
Bradlee remained with &quot;Newsweek&quot; until he was promoted to managing editor at the &quot;Post&quot; in 1965. He became executive editor in 1968.

Under Bradlee&#x27;s leadership, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; took on major challenges during the Nixon administration. In 1971 he hid a team of lawyers, editors and writers led by him and Ben Bagdikian in Bradlee&#x27;s own Georgetown home, and supervised the team’s resulting publication of the Pentagon Papers. &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Post&quot; successfully challenged the government over the right to publish the Papers.
One year later, Bradlee backed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee:
You had a lot of Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name &#x27;Hunt,&#x27; H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, &#x27;Well, he&#x27;s not here now; he&#x27;s over at&#x27; such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, &#x27;We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.&#x27; And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, &#x27;Oh my God!&#x27; and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying &#x27;Oh my God!&#x27; At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, &#x27;What do you do?&#x27; and Woodward overheard the words &#x27;CIA.&#x27; So if your interest isn&#x27;t whetted by this time, you&#x27;re not a journalist.

Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon&#x27;s FBI associate director Mark Felt.

In 1981, &quot;Post&quot; reporter Janet Cooke won a Pulitzer Prize for &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s World&quot;, a profile of an eight-year-old heroin addict. Cooke&#x27;s article turned out to be fiction — there was no such addict. As executive editor, Bradlee was roundly criticized in many circles for failing to ensure the article&#x27;s accuracy. After questions about the story&#x27;s veracity arose, Bradlee (along with publisher Donald Graham) ordered a &quot;full disclosure&quot; investigation to ascertain the truth. Bradlee personally apologized to Mayor Marion Barry and the chief of police of Washington, D.C., for the &quot;Post&quot;″s fictitious article. Cooke, meanwhile, was forced to resign from the &quot;Post&quot; and relinquish the Pulitzer.

==Activities and awards after retirement==
Bradlee retired as the executive editor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in September 1991 but continued to serve as vice president at large until his death. He was succeeded as executive editor at the &quot;Post&quot; by Leonard Downie Jr., whom Bradlee had appointed as managing editor seven years earlier.

In 1991, he was persuaded by then–governor of Maryland William Donald Schaefer to accept the chairmanship of the Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City Commission and continued in that position through 2003. He also served for many years as a member of the board of trustees at St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland, and endowed the Benjamin C. Bradlee Annual Lecture in Journalism there. He continued to serve as vice chairman of the school&#x27;s board of trustees.

In 1991, Bradlee delivered the Theodore H. White lecture at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. His message: Lying in Washington, whether in the White House or the Congress, is wrong, immoral, tearing at the fiber of our national instincts and institutions — and must stop. He said, &quot;Lying has reached such epidemic proportions in our culture and among our institutions in recent years, that we&#x27;ve all become immunized to it.&quot; He suggested that the deceit was degrading the respect for the truth.

Bradlee had an acting role in &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;, the 1993 remake of the 1950 romantic comedy.

In 1988, Bradlee received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

His autobiography, &quot;A Good Life: Newspapering and Other Adventures&quot;, was published in 1995.

In recognition of his work as editor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Bradlee won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism in 1998.

In the fall of 2005, Jim Lehrer interviewed Bradlee for six hours on topics from the responsibilities of the press to Watergate to the Valerie Plame affair. The interviews were edited for an hour-long documentary, &quot;Free Speech: Jim Lehrer and Ben Bradlee&quot;, which premiered on PBS on , 2006.

On , 2006, Bradlee received a Doctor of Humane Letters from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Prior to receiving the honorary degree, he taught occasional journalism courses at Georgetown. Bradlee received the French Legion of Honor, the highest award given by the French government, at a ceremony in 2007 in Paris.

Bradlee was named as a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama on , 2013, and was presented the medal at a White House ceremony on , 2013.

==Marriages and children==
Bradlee was married three times. His first marriage was to Jean Saltonstall. Like Bradlee, Saltonstall also came from a wealthy and prominent Boston family. They married on , 1942, the same day Bradlee graduated from Harvard and entered the Navy. They had one son, Ben Bradlee Jr., who later became first a reporter, then a deputy managing editor at &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;.

Bradlee and his first wife divorced while he was an overseas correspondent for &quot;Newsweek&quot;. In 1957, he married Antoinette &#x27;Tony&#x27; Pinchot Pittman (sister of Mary Pinchot Meyer). Together, they had a son, Dominic, and a daughter, Marina. This marriage also ended in divorce.

Bradlee&#x27;s final marriage was to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reporter Sally Quinn in 1978. Quinn and Bradlee had one child, Quinn Bradlee (born 1982) when Quinn was 40 and Bradlee was 60.

==Death==
Bradlee suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in his final years. In late September 2014, he entered hospice care due to declining health. He died , 2014, at his home in Washington, D.C., at the age of 93. His funeral was held at the Washington National Cathedral. He was buried at the Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

<text>HMS &quot;Theseus&quot; was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy.

One of the eight ships designed by Thomas Slade, she was built at Perry, Blackwall Yard, London and launched on 25 September 1786.

==Service==
&quot;Theseus&quot; was the flagship of Rear Admiral Horatio Nelson&#x27;s fleet for the 1797 Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Day to day command was vested in her flag captain Ralph Willett Miller. The British were defeated in the battle and Nelson was wounded by a musket ball while aboard the &quot;Theseus&quot;, precipitating the amputation of his right arm.

Despite the defeat, morale and good order were retained aboard the ship. In August 1797 ship&#x27;s surgeon Robert Tainsh reported a mere nine cases of illness aboard, with little incidence of scurvy and a ready supply of antiscorbutics. An outbreak of ulcers was attributed to the overuse of salted provisions and addressed by Miller&#x27;s insistence on ensuring a supply of onions and lemons as part of daily rations. Also with Miller&#x27;s approval, the lower deck ports were periodically washed with nitrous acid to reduce the risk of mould, windsails were installed to encourage a flow of fresh air below decks and the crew&#x27;s hammocks were ordered to be aired three times a week.

===Battle of the Nile===
In 1798, &quot;Theseus&quot; took part in the decisive Battle of the Nile, under the command of Captain Ralph Willett Miller. The Royal Navy fleet was outnumbered, at least in firepower, by the French fleet, which boasted the 118-gun ship-of-the-line &quot;L&#x27;Orient&quot;, three 80-gun warships and nine of the popular 74-gun ships. The Royal Navy fleet in comparison had just thirteen 74-gun ships and one 50-gun fourth-rate.

During the battle &quot;Theseus&quot;, along with , assisted and , who were being attacked by a number of French warships. The French frigate &quot;Artemise&quot; surrendered to the British, with the crew setting fire to their ship to prevent it falling into the hands of the British. Two other French ships &quot;Heureux&quot; and &quot;Mercure&quot; ran aground and soon surrendered after a brief encounter with three British warships, one of which was &quot;Theseus&quot;.

The battle was a success for the Royal Navy, as well as for the career of Admiral Nelson. It cut supply lines to the French army in Egypt, whose wider objective was to threaten British India. The casualties were heavy; the French suffered over 1,700 killed, over 600 wounded and 3,000 captured. The British suffered 218 dead and 677 wounded. Nine French warships were captured and two destroyed. Two other French warships managed to escape. &quot;Theseus&quot; had five sailors killed and thirty wounded, included one officer and five Royal Marines.

===Siege of Acre===

&quot;Theseus&quot; played a less successful role in the 1799 Siege of Acre, under the command of Captain Ralph Willett Miller. On 13 May 1799 she reached the nearby port of Caesarea, and Miller ordered the ship readied for action in bombarding Acre the following morning. A large quantity of ammunition was brought to the deck for use by the ship&#x27;s guns, including more than 70 18-pound and 36-pound shells. At 9.30am on the 14th, the ammunition was accidentally ignited while the ship was under way. The resulting explosion set fire to the deck, mainmast and mizzen mast, and killed Miller and 25 other men. Another 45 crew members were injured.

Flames quickly spread between &quot;Theseus&quot;″ decks, and a second detonation of ammunition stores destroyed the poop and quarterdecks and toppled the main mast over the starboard bow. A further ten men were killed before the fire was brought under control, leaving the ship unserviceable for the Acre campaign.

===Later service===
Four years later a refitted &quot;Theseus&quot; took part in the Blockade of Saint-Domingue in 1803, under Captain John Bligh. 
She also took part in the Battle of the Basque Roads in 1809. Lord Cochrane initiated a daring attack, led by fire ships and other explosive vessels, in an attempt to cause chaos among their target, an anchored French squadron. Many of the French ships were subsequently run aground due to the havoc that this attack caused. The enemy squadron would probably have been completely destroyed had the Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Lord Gambier, not hesitated over necessary decisions, such as to deploy the main fleet which instead lay in wait for their orders. Thus the remnants of the French escaped destruction.

&quot;Theseus&quot; was broken up at Chatham in 1814.

==In popular culture==
In the Patrick O&#x27;Brian novel &quot;Master and Commander&quot;, Capt. Jack Aubrey is said to have served aboard HMS &quot;Theseus&quot; early in his career.

<text>The Metro Blue Line is a light rail line in Hennepin County, Minnesota, that is part of the Metro network. It travels from downtown Minneapolis to Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport and the southern suburb of Bloomington. Formerly the Hiawatha Line (Route 55) prior to May 2013, the line was originally named after the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s Hiawatha passenger train and Hiawatha Avenue, reusing infrastructure from the former and running parallel to the latter for a portion of the route. The line opened June 26, 2004, and was the first light rail service in Minnesota. An extension, Bottineau LRT, is planned to open in 2028.

The Blue Line is operated by Metro Transit, the primary bus and train operator in the Twin Cities. As of December 2022, the service operates from approximately 3:19am to 12:50am with 15minute headways most of the day. The route averaged 32,928 daily riders in 2019, representing 13 percent of Metro Transit&#x27;s ridership. The line carried 10.6 million riders in 2015.

In South Minneapolis, several bus routes converge at transit centers along the line, offering connections to other Metro lines and frequent bus routes. The line has two park and ride stations, the Fort Snelling and 30th Avenue stations, with a combined capacity of 2,569 vehicles. Major destinations along the corridor include downtown Minneapolis, Lake Street, Minnehaha Park, Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport, and the Mall of America. At the airport, the Blue Line provides free, 24/7 service between Lindbergh and Humphrey terminals. A night owl shuttle train, the Airport Shuttle, runs between terminals during times when no Blue Line service is scheduled.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The Minneapolis–St. Paul area once had an extensive network of streetcars (operated for many years by Twin City Rapid Transit, a precursor of Metro Transit), but the tracks were removed and services were eliminated in the 1950s.

Over the years since the last trolley ran in 1954, many people have pushed for the reintroduction of rail transport in the Twin Cities. Proposals for a modern streetcar or light rail along the Hiawatha Avenue corridor appeared in the pages of the Star Tribune as early as 1974. The primary reason is that traffic congestion has grown considerably since the streetcar system ceased operation: a 2003 report by the Texas Transportation Institute indicated that the area was the 17th most congested area in the country, with the second fastest congestion growth.

Rail projects struggled to gain political support until the 1990s, when several factors combined to make the idea more palatable. Governor Jesse Ventura and Minnesota Transportation Commissioner Elwyn Tinklenberg heavily promoted the idea of rail transport, and significant amounts of money became available from the federal government. Previous governors had advocated light rail, but had not been able to get legislation passed. Governor Tim Pawlenty had campaigned on a promise to fight the expansion of light rail, but altered his opinions after taking office. He also initially opposed the Northstar Line commuter rail project, which is a rail corridor north of Minneapolis, but changed his mind about that project in January 2004 when a scaled-back version was shown to have good potential.

=== Project development ===
For many, the Hiawatha Avenue corridor was not the top choice for a new project. Popular other options included connecting Minneapolis with the western suburbs, though probably the most-desired option has been the Central Corridor connecting the Twin Cities themselves (Minneapolis and St. Paul) with a route down the middle of Interstate 94 or University Avenue. However, much of the land had already been acquired by the state in the 1960s to build a sunken radial expressway into downtown that was never built. In addition to the available land, the desire to connect to the airport and at least reach the vicinity of the Mall of America proved to be the bigger draw for decision-makers.

The idea of running a rail line down Hiawatha Avenue had already been around for at least a decade by the time the decision was made to go forward. In 1985, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) had produced an Environmental Impact Statement that concluded that light rail was the best alternative for the corridor. In 1996, the document was examined again as Mn/DOT looked at the possibility of adding bus rapid transit along the road, but money for light rail became available soon after, leading to the current layout.

=== Construction and opening ===
The line&#x27;s cost totaled $715.3 million, with $334.3 million coming from the federal government. This is considerably higher than initial budgets predicted—the figure was about $400 million in 1997. Opponents to the rail line state that it went far over-budget, but supporters of the line state that extensions of the route and other alterations, plus the impact of inflation, are the real reasons for the increased cost. Initial designs cut out the last stop in downtown, and the southern end of the line did not quite connect to the Mall of America. The Warehouse District stop was added early but another cost increase came from approximately $40 million to enhance the line (while construction was in progress) to bring the line directly into the Mall of America&#x27;s transit hub. It was completed later than what was initially hoped for (a lot of literature points to 2003 as the opening year), but the mall connection was a significant contribution to the extra time requirements. These extensions are also why the line was initially reported to be long, but ended up being in length. The Target Field extension in 2009 added a few more tenths to the length. Groundbreaking for the line took place on January 17, 2001.

In March 2004, the labor union representing Metro Transit bus workers went on strike. This delayed the opening of the line from the anticipated start date of April 3, although there was some indication that the opening would have been delayed anyway. Apparently, some of the delay had to do with slow delivery of trainsets from Bombardier. Certain aspects of the design had been tried before, but the cars were the first to combine the factors of conforming to American standards (as opposed to European), having low floors and being built at the company&#x27;s Mexico plant. Some problems also cropped up during testing of the vehicles, but Bombardier said that the issues were not out of the ordinary.

When the buses began rolling again on April 19, the line&#x27;s opening was rolled back to June 26. Testing of the track and vehicles continued during the bus strike, as much of the work was performed by Bombardier employees rather than Metro Transit workers. Train operators who had already gone through the training process were given refresher courses when the strike ended. Regular service began on the first phase of the line on June 26, 2004, with the second phase opening later that year on December 4. Each opening was accompanied with two days of free rides on the train and area buses. The line was tested for months before opening, with regular service simulated for about a month before each phase went online. The Hiawatha Line opened exactly 50 years and one week after the last regular-service streetcars ran in the city.

Light rail staff, security, and volunteers produced a largely hitch-free opening day for the new rail system on June 26, 2004. Officials estimated 30,000 people boarded the electric-powered trains during the transit system&#x27;s first day of service. Train rides were free. Each station featured live entertainment and food as a diversion for the long waits to board the trains. Predicted daily ridership was 19,300 for 2005 and 24,600 for 2020.

=== Developments post-opening ===

Busways are still being examined for many future projects and it appears likely that at least one will be built. Construction of the area&#x27;s second light rail line, the Green Line connecting downtown Minneapolis and St. Paul began in late 2010 and opened on June 14, 2014. On April 26, 2011, the U.S. government announced $478 million in funding for its construction.

During Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018, hosted at U.S. Bank Stadium, the Blue Line was restricted to ticketholders and ran with non-stop service between a security checkpoint at the Mall of America and the stadium station. Service at other stations was replaced with free shuttle buses.

In July 2011, the Metropolitan Council officially approved renaming the Hiawatha Line as the Blue Line. This is part of a broader color scheme for identifying Twin Cities transit lines, including the Green Line light rail to St. Paul, the Orange Line bus rapid transit along I-35W, and the operational Red Line bus rapid transit service along Cedar Avenue. The name officially changed on Friday, May 17, 2013.

Starting July 8, 2022, in a planned 5 week project, the Blue line shut down 5 stops from Mall of America to Airport Terminal 2 for the &#x27;Largest construction project in the light rail line&#x27;s history.&#x27; According to Metro Transit, the project consists of replacing sections of tracks that &quot;have worn out and upgrades technology that guides safety systems.&quot;

In addition, the updates will also bring safety enhancements and allow trains to switch tracks and turn around near the 30th Avenue Station, which will provide more opportunity to keep trains moving if a section of track is taken out of service. Ryan Heath, engineer for Metro Transit who is overseeing the project, said that &quot;this is important for the Blue Line&#x27;s next 40 years. We&#x27;re looking out literally decades with an eye toward improving the reliability and maintainability of our system.&quot;

=== Proposed extension ===

An extension of the line to Brooklyn Park is planned. On August 3, 2020, after years of disagreements with The Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway Company regarding use of BNSF&#x27;s right-of-way, Metropolitan Council announced they would begin to &quot;explore opportunities to advance this critical project without using BNSF Railway right of way.&quot; Current plans call for the Blue Line Extension to run west from Target Field to Lyndale Avenue, then through north Minneapolis via Lyndale Avenue, West Broadway Avenue, and Bottineau Boulevard, until it meets the originally planned route near 73rd Avenue and West Broadway.

== Route ==

The Blue Line runs from downtown Minneapolis to the Mall of America for a length of . The southern terminus at the Mall of America station and transit center is located beneath the east parking ramp of the mall and has direct access to the mall. The station offers connections to the Red Line and other local bus routes including those operated by Minnesota Valley Transit Authority. From the Mall of America trains travel east towards the 28th Avenue station park-and-ride ramp. The route travels through Bloomington&#x27;s South Loop District before reaching the Terminal 2–Humphrey station of the MSP Airport across from Fort Snelling National Cemetery. To cross the MSP Airport the line then enters a pair of tunnels that required a tunnel boring machine and cost $110 million to construct. While traveling through the tunnels, trains stop at the underground Terminal 1–Lindbergh station. Once emerging from the tunnel, the line serves two park-and-ride lots at Fort Snelling station. From Fort Snelling station, the line travels on the surface in separated right of way parallel to Minnesota State Highway 55 while stopping at stations near the VA Medical center, Minnehaha Park, and other locations in south Minneapolis. Trains travel on bridges over traffic at busy intersections near Lake Street and Franklin Ave with overhead stations located at each crossing.

After crossing to the other side of Highway 55, the line runs on the former Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific Short Line roadbed which brought &quot;Hiawatha&quot; passenger trains to the downtown depot. After crossing I-35W on a dedicated bridge, the train begins to share tracks with the Green Line and enters downtown by traveling around U.S. Bank Stadium. The U.S. Bank Stadium station is surrounded by a pedestrian plaza that is used for loading riders onto trains after events at US Bank Stadium. While passing the Downtown East Commons, the route travels through downtown on surface streets. The line shares the road with one lane of automobile traffic through downtown with the exception of the block along Government Plaza station where the street is closed and a pedestrian plaza connecting the Minneapolis City Hall and the Hennepin County Government Center. With a stop at Nicollet Mall the line offers connections to an important transit and pedestrian corridor. The train terminates at Target Field station which offers connections to the Northstar Commuter Rail.
=== Stations ===

Each of the 19 stations along the route is designed in a unique architectural style reflective of the station&#x27;s surrounding community. This is not an entirely new idea for the region, as many of the higher-traffic bus stops around the city have distinctive designs. Due to the unique makeup of Minneapolis&#x27; population, ticket-dispensing machines present instructions in four languages: English, Spanish, Somali and Hmong. Travel time is roughly two to three minutes between most stations.

The airport used to operate a bus shuttle between the two terminals, but the light-rail line has replaced that service. No fare is required to ride between the two airport stations and trains run between these stations 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Only seven of the original 17 stations was built to accommodate three car trains, but due to the need to increase the line&#x27;s capacity, the remaining stations were retrofitted or extended to accommodate three-car trains in 2009. The extensions were paid for primarily with federal money but the Metropolitan Council, Hennepin County, and city of Bloomington also contributed some funds.

=== Station additions ===
The Blue Line was extended several blocks northwest from the Warehouse District/Hennepin Avenue station to the Target Field Station in 2009. The station was paid for by the Minnesota Twins as part of the construction and opening of Target Field. The two-level station has light rail platforms on the upper level for use by Blue Line and Green Line light rail trains, and platforms next to the BNSF mainline tracks passing beneath the station to serve the Northstar Line commuter rail. The under construction Green Line extension, also known as the Southwest Corridor, will connect directly to the end of the Blue Line to share service with the station.

Largely federal money but also with some local contributions was secured for construction of the new American Boulevard Station in Bloomington between the Humphrey Terminal Station and Bloomington Central Station. This station was included in the line&#x27;s original plans, but was postponed due to cost overruns. Because much of the necessary underground infrastructure for the station was installed when the line was constructed, the station was built with minimal service interruptions.

== Service ==

Passengers who ride the rail system are charged the same fare as they would pay for the local Metro Transit bus system, and they are able to use their bus transfer cards to switch between the two different modes of transportation without making another payment. A new payment system using smart cards (locally known as Go-To Cards) was initially expected to be introduced along with the rail line in June 2004, but software bugs delayed introduction. By September 2006, the bugs were worked out and the Go-To Cards became operational.

In basic service trains operate every 10 to 15 minutes and operate less frequently in the early morning and late-night. Additional trains operate on Friday and Saturday nights. The line shuts down for about four hours each night, except for a shuttle service between the two terminals at the MSP airport which run 24 hours a day. Vehicles have a capacity of 66 seated passengers and 120 standing. Currently two or three vehicles are run together to increase capacity.

=== Ridership ===
The line accounts for about 13% of Metro Transit&#x27;s total ridership. Less than two years after opening, the line had already exceeded its 2020 weekday ridership goal of 24,800. The line carried 10.6 million riders in 2015. In 2018 weekday ridership on the Blue Line was 32,921. Ridership for both the Green and Blue Lines combined was down 59% in 2020 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ridership had begun to recover in 2023, but average weekday ridership remained below 20,000 

=== Fares ===
The Blue Line uses a proof-of-payment system, requiring riders to carry tickets at all times. Fares are purchased before boarding, either at ticket machines located in the stations or by scanning a Go-To card at dedicated pedestals. Tickets are valid for hours after purchase, with transfers available to other Metro lines as well as any Metro Transit bus routes. Fares can range from 50¢ within the two Downtown Zones of Minneapolis and St. Paul to $2.50 for adults in rush hours.

The Blue Line uses 27 Bombardier Flexity Swift light rail vehicles (LRVs) manufactured by and 12 Siemens S70 LRVs. The system is designed to operate on 750 volts DC. Trains can reach speeds of , but the &quot;general service speed&quot; is about or slower (especially in the congested downtown region). They are of a 70% low-floor design, meaning that 70 percent of the floor inside is within about of the ground. This is the same height as the rail platforms, allowing stepless access for passengers dependent on wheelchairs or other mobility aids. The feature also makes it easier for passengers with bicycles or strollers to board the train. Each vehicle weighs about when empty. Minneapolis is the first and only city to use this LRV model in the United States.

Vehicles have a color scheme that is primarily a combination of blue, yellow, and white. Yellow was the color used on the previous streetcar system in the area. Each vehicle has an &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; section: The &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; sections are the large portions on each end, while the &quot;C&quot; section is a small portion that connects the two other pieces and has the vehicle&#x27;s middle truck or bogie. Electricity is collected by a pantograph mounted on the &quot;B&quot; section. The first &quot;Type I&quot; LRV was delivered on March 19, 2003. 14 of 15 delivered vehicles were operational for the opening weekend. The initial order was eventually bumped up to a full 24 vehicles, which were operational by early 2005. Three additional vehicles were ordered in the winter of 2006/2007, using leftover funds from the construction budget for one vehicle and Hennepin County funds for the other two.

The noses of these vehicles are built to a different design than is standard for the Flexity Swift, containing a small scoop-shaped area. This assists in the removal of snow, but the anticipated snow-management method is merely to run trains on a frequent basis rather than actually using snow removal equipment (this was what the earlier streetcar system usually did to keep lines clear, though they also often featured small scrapers in front of the lead wheels).

Each vehicle has a number of cameras on board, pointing both inward and outward, to monitor passenger activity and other areas of interest for security and safety. Train stations also have cameras. Video feeds and the position of each vehicle on the line are monitored in a control room at the system&#x27;s maintenance facility, located between Cedar-Riverside and Franklin Avenue stations.

According to Metropolitan Council meeting notes dated July 30, 2010, for the August 9 Transportation Committee meeting, Siemens Industry Incorporated agreed to build the Light Rail Vehicles for the three-car train expansion project in a joint procurement with the Green Line&#x27;s initial LRV procurement, at a per-LRV cost of $3,297,714 and a total contract value of $153,211,516. According to Mark Fuhrmann&#x27;s presentation at the July 26, 2010, Transportation Committee meeting, these &quot;Type II&quot; LRVs are mechanically, but not electronically, compatible with the current fleet of 27 &quot;type I&quot; vehicles, so while the two generations are able to run at the same time and either type would be able to push a malfunctioning unit of the other type, multiple-unit trains can only be assembled of one type. The Metro Blue Line uses 12 &quot;Type II&quot; S70 LRVs.

== Safety ==

With an expansion of the light rail system happening with the opening of the Green Line in 2014, Metro Transit rolled out a new rail safety campaign, with representatives of Metro Transit customers visiting schools and organizations situated near the Blue Line to discuss rail safety. The campaign won a visual design award from the Minnesota Association of Government Communicators. By January 2015, there had been 11 deaths from accidents on the line, eight of them pedestrians. After two more people were killed in separate incidents on the Blue Line, one a bicyclist and one a man in a wheelchair, signs saying &quot;See Tracks? Think Train&quot; were added at locations of recent deaths along the Blue Line and Green Line. As of September 2019, 15 people have died in crashes with Blue Line trains.

Additionally, there has been concern over violent assaults, robberies, and disorderly conduct that occurs on the station platforms while people wait for the trains. There was a murder by stabbing at the Lake Street/Midtown station in December 2014. Aggravated assaults, which involve the use of a weapon to cause serious injury, continued to increase through 2019 including another murder by stabbing at the Lake Street/Midtown station in October 2017. Increased police officer hours, including the use of plainclothes police officers, were added to address safety concerns in 2019. Other efforts included allowing riders to text a number to communicate with police and teams dedicated to helping homeless riders were added in the same year. In January 2020, the Met Council approved $1.3 million in spending to install new 360-degree 4K resolution cameras on all Metro Transit light rail cars by the end of 2020. Another stabbing that resulted in death occurred on a train in Bloomington in January 2020, but no charges were filed due to claims of self-defense.

<text>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is a 1988 American comedy film directed by Frank Oz and produced by Bernard Williams. It is a remake of the 1964 film &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, whose co-writers Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning received screen credit for &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot;, along with writer Dale Launer. Set on the French Riviera, the film stars Steve Martin and Michael Caine as two con men competing to swindle a wealthy tourist (Glenne Headly) out of $50,000.

&quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; was first released in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on December 5, 1988, and was later released in theaters on December 14, 1988 by Orion Pictures to positive reviews from critics, and went on to gross $42 million at the U.S. box office.

==Plot==
Lawrence Jamieson is a sophisticated and affluent British con artist operating in the town of Beaumont-sur-Mer on the French Riviera. Aided by his manservant Arthur and amoral police official Andre, Lawrence seduces wealthy women and cons them for high-value sums by posing as an exiled prince raising money for his country&#x27;s freedom fighters. While returning from a trip to Zurich, Lawrence encounters Freddy Benson, an unsophisticated American hustler who brags of conning women out of relatively meager amounts with stories of his sick grandmother.

After Freddy inadvertently interferes with Lawrence&#x27;s latest target, Lawrence tricks him into leaving town. However, after meeting one of Lawrence&#x27;s former victims and realizing Lawrence is a fellow con artist, Freddy returns and blackmails Lawrence into training him. Lawrence teaches Freddy his refined style of deception—with limited success—and develops a new con in which Freddy portrays his mentally disabled brother to drive away women once Lawrence has their money. Freddy quits after Lawrence refuses to pay him a portion of the ill-gotten gains. Unwilling to share his territory with Freddy, the pair agree to a bet: the first to con $50,000 from a selected victim wins and the other leaves town. They choose newly-arrived tourist, the naive &quot;United States Soap Queen&quot; Janet Colgate.

Lawrence attempts his usual con but Freddy intervenes, posing as a U.S. Navy veteran and psychosomatic parapalegic who needs $50,000 for treatment from psychiatrist Dr. Emil Schaffhausen. In response, Lawrence poses as Schaffhausen and agrees to treat Freddy if Janet pays him $50,000 directly. The pair compete for Janet&#x27;s attention, with Lawrence tormenting Freddy under the guise of treatment, and Freddy manipulating her with a fake suicide attempt. One night, in a club, Lawrence dances with Janet and taunts Freddy which upsets some nearby British sailors. Freddy convinces them that Lawrence stole Janet from him and the sailors agree to help. Later, Lawrence learns that Janet is not wealthy—having won her holiday and title in a soap company competition—yet has liquidated all of her assets to help Freddy. Touched by her genuine kindness and generosity, and adhering to his personal code of never taking advantage of the poor or virtuous, Lawrence calls off the bet. Freddy counters with a new bet: the first to seduce Janet wins. Lawrence refuses to participate but agrees that if Freddy succeeds, he wins.

After Lawrence is abducted by the sailors, Freddy returns to Janet&#x27;s hotel room and demonstrates his &quot;love&quot; for her by walking. Lawrence, who is also in the room, declares Freddy cured, having appeased the sailors by revealing his status as a Royal Naval Reserve officer. He leaves Freddy with the sailors who haze him until the morning while Lawrence puts Janet on an airplane home. However, Janet returns to her hotel room to find Freddy waiting and declares her love for him. Andre informs Lawrence who prepares to accept his defeat until Janet arrives at Lawrence&#x27;s villa in tears, revealing that Freddy stole the $50,000 she had collected for him. Lawrence gifts her a bag containing $50,000 of his own money and returns her to the airport, instructing Andre to arrest Freddy. Before her plane departs, Janet returns the bag to Lawrence, saying she cannot accept it. Andre arrives with Freddy who claims that Janet stole his wallet and clothes. Lawrence opens the bag and finds the money replaced with a note revealing that Janet is the Jackal, a prominent American con artist. Freddy is furious but Lawrence takes delight in having been so skillfully deceived.

A week later, Freddy and Lawrence contemplate their loss at Lawrence&#x27;s villa. A group of wealthy tourists arrive led by Janet, who is posing as a high-value real estate agent. While the tourists head to the villa, Janet tells Lawrence and Freddy that while she made millions in the last year, taking their money was the most fun. Lawrence and Freddy assume their roles in Janet&#x27;s plot as the trio prepares to scam their latest victims.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Pre-production===
The 1988 version underwent casting changes. It started as a possible vehicle for Mick Jagger and David Bowie, who approached Dale Launer to write a screenplay for them. Launer suggested a remake of &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;. Launer acquired the rights for the remake, but Bowie and Jagger dropped out to do a movie with Martin Scorsese. According to Bowie, they were &quot;a bit tweezed that we lost out on a script that could have been reasonably good.&quot; According to Splitsider, Eddie Murphy was considered for the role of Freddy Benson. John Cleese was also approached for the role of Jamieson, but declined. He admitted in a 2008 interview that he regretted doing so.

Richard Dreyfuss was also sent a script. Though he was intended for the part of Benson, a misunderstanding resulted in him preparing the part of Jamieson, so Steve Martin (who had also been asked to play Jamieson) read Benson&#x27;s part instead. Oz was excited by Martin&#x27;s version of Benson, and settled on this choice. Michael Caine was eventually chosen to play Jamieson. Michael Palin, who had also been considered for the role, wrote in his diary that Caine was &quot;probably the nearest he (Oz) will get in an English actor to the effortless charisma of Niven.&quot;

===Filming===

Production of the film began on June 6, 1988, and lasted through early August, finishing &quot;six days ahead of schedule.&quot; Filming locations included Antibes, Cannes, Beaulieu-sur-Mer (depicted in the film as &quot;Beaumont-sur-Mer&quot;), Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, Nice and Villefranche-sur-Mer. The Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild was visited by the leading characters in a scene. The estate belonging to Lawrence is a private villa (Villa Hier) located at the tip of the Cap d&#x27;Antibes.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
Prior to the film&#x27;s December 14, 1988 theatrical release in the United States, it premiered at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on December 5. The studio held test screenings of the film in early October, one for a blue-collar audience and one for &quot;more upscale&quot;, with both receiving high marks.

===Home media===
In a DVD extra providing a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film, Frank Oz discusses a teaser trailer he directed for the studio, which he wanted to use for promotion before there was enough actual footage to assemble a trailer. An entire day was spent filming a scene (which in the end never made the final cut of the movie) in which Freddy and Lawrence stroll along the promenade, politely moving out of the way of other people, until Freddy casually pushes an elderly woman into the water and Lawrence nonchalantly shoves a little boy&#x27;s face into his cotton candy.

==Reception==
===Box office===

The film grossed $3.8 million from 1,466 theaters in its opening weekend, finishing fifth at the box office. In total it grossed $42 million in the US.

===Critical response===

According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 89% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus called the movie &quot;buoyant [and] clever&quot; and praised Caine and Martin&#x27;s chemistry. At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating generally favorable reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote that while the film was predictable, Martin and Caine&#x27;s chemistry was enjoyable and &quot;Headly provides a resilient foil.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;wonderfully crafted&quot; and &quot;absolutely charming&quot; and praised the editing and music. Echoing other critics, Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commended Caine and Martin&#x27;s partnership and the film&#x27;s divergence from &quot;mistimed and misdirected comedies&quot; from that time.

<text>Kongo Central (), formerly Bas-Congo, is one of the 26 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Its capital is Matadi.

==History==
At the time of independence, the area now encompassing Kongo Central was part of the greater province of Léopoldville, along with the capital city of Kinshasa and the districts of Kwango, Kwilu and Mai-Ndombe. Under Belgian colonial rule, the province was known as Bas-Congo (as in &quot;Lower Congo River&quot;) and was renamed Kongo Central after independence.

Under the regime of Mobutu Sese Seko from 1965 to 1997, the Congo river was renamed as &quot;Zaire&quot;. The province was named as Bas-Zaïre. The name was later reverted to Bas-Congo. It was subsequently renamed as Kongo Central in 2015.

==Geography==
Kongo Central is the only province in the country with an ocean coastline; it has narrow frontage on the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It borders the city-province of Kinshasa to the north-east, the province of Kwango to the east, and the Republic of Angola to the south as well as the Republic of the Congo and Cabinda to the north.

The lower Congo River traverses the province from the north-east to the south-west. It is navigable from the Atlantic Ocean to the port city of Matadi after which there are a series of rapids that make it unnavigable until the Malebo Pool.

=== Divisions ===
The provincial capital is Matadi, with Boma being the other official city. The remainder of the province is administratively divided into ten territories, the most of any province:

Before 2015 these territories were divisions of the Bas-Fleuve, Cataractes and Lukaya districts; except for Moanda, which was attached to Boma (a city/district hybrid).

Towns with their 2010 populations are:

<doc id="446937" wikidata="Q671442" url="?curid=446937" title="Bandundu Province">
<text>Bandundu is one of eleven former provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It bordered the provinces of Kinshasa and Bas-Congo to the west, Équateur to the north, and Kasai-Occidental to the east. The provincial capital is also called Bandundu (formerly Banningstad/Banningville).

==History==
Bandundu was formed in 1966 by merging the three post-colonial political regions: Kwilu, Kwango, and Mai-Ndombe. Under the 2006 constitution, Bandundu was to be broken up again into the aforementioned political regions.
This finally took place in the 2015 repartitioning. Kwilu province was formed by combining the Kwilu district and the cities of Bandundu and Kikwit, Kwango province from the Kwango district, and Mai-Ndombe province by combining the Plateaux and Mai-Ndombe districts.

==Geography==

The landscape of Bandundu province consisted primarily of plateaus covered in savanna, cut by rivers and streams that are often bordered by thick forest.
The province was bisected by the Kasai River, which flows into the Congo River on the province&#x27;s western boundary. 
Other major rivers are the Kwango, Kwenge, Kwilu and Lukenie.
Lake Mai-Ndombe is the largest lake, with this lake and the surrounding swamp forest forming the southern portion of the Tumba-Ngiri-Maindombe Ramsar wetlands.

==Economy==
Most villages are situated on the higher ground, with the villagers practicing shifting slash-and-burn agriculture in the valleys. The main crops are manioc (cassava), maize, squash, and beans. 
The villagers raise chickens, ducks, goats, sheep and cattle, and supplement their diet with fish and bushmeat. A few Indian and Chinese business people selling electronics, such as cell phones, televisions and sound systems, have opened shop recently.

==Divisions==

The province was divided into the cities of Bandundu and Kikwit and the districts of Kwango, Kwilu, Mai-Ndombe and Plateaux.
Cities and towns, with their 2010 populations, are:
Mateko is a town located in the Bandundu Province. The total population of the town in 2,367. 
It is located in the North-West of Idiofa Territory in the Kwilu District. The name Mateko designates: Mateko as a Sector (Collectivite), Mateko as a local municipality (Groupement) and Mateko as a town (Cite). It is about 45 km to Panu, one of the major harbours of Idiofa territory. Mateko is surrounded by beautiful small and big rivers such as Kamuntsha, Diambala river, Madzulu and Kimpele. Kamuntsha river is the nearest big river to Mateko, a tributary of the Kasai river and one of the important rivers of the region that facilitates trading between Mateko and Kinshasa. Kikongo (Kituba) is the main language of Mateko.

==Education==
*University of Bandundu
*University of Kikwit

==Daily life==
Many citizens of Bandundu make their living with small provision shops selling basic food items, various beauty products and other beauty products such as weave hair. There has been an increase in foreign entrepreneurs opening electronics shops and other electronic items increasing the market awareness. Today&#x27;s bus transportation (costs $30 one way) from Kinshasa (the Capital) to Bandundu is twice a week, but the ferry crossing only operates from 7am to 5 pm. There are two television stations normally showing local news from Kinshasa, religion or the country&#x27;s national sport; football. Hotels, like the Hotel Vendome, are slowly evolving in the center of town, offering full services to include its own dedicated internet. Although international visitors are minimal, there are occasional visitors connected to NGOs and local government work. Chez Jacque, an outdoor disco, provides a nightlife of Congolese music for the younger population; however, most citizens prefer the sidewalk cafes with music, grilled goat meat and beer; such as Primus, Mitzig and Doppel. Local transportation in Bandundu is mostly bicycles and motorbikes referred to as &quot;Toleka&quot; meaning &quot;Let&#x27;s go&quot; in the Lingala language. Traffic flows are closely directed by the street police at each intersection to avoid clashes between the few cars, motor bikes, foot traffic, and push carts. The local cultural center is used for graduations, public services, and church. There are enormous money changing outlets for local and international money, such as Soficom and Western Union. Music is an enormous part of life in the Congo where the love of the rhumba can dominate the dance floor with the likes for King Kester Emeneya, etc., crooning to the old samba beat from a Cuban influence.

==Principal languages==
Two main trade languages are spoken in the Bandundu Province: Lingala, spoken north of the Kasai River, and Kituba (also called Kikongo ya Leta) spoken south of the river. These languages have become so commonplace that many have grown up using them as their first language. There are also many local dialects such as Lele, Kimbala, Kisamba, and Wongo.

<text>Équateur (French for &quot;Equator&quot;) was a province in the northwest of Belgian Congo and the independent Republic of the Congo, now known as Democratic Republic of the Congo.
It had its origins in the Équateur District of the Congo Free State, the private property of King Leopold II of Belgium. 
It was upgraded to provincial status in 1917. Between 1933 and 1947 it was named Coquilhatville.
In 1962 it was divided into three smaller provinces, but they were recombined in 1966. Équateur was one of the eleven provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo until 2015, when it was split into the new, smaller Équateur province, as well as the Tshuapa, Mongala, Nord-Ubangi and Sud-Ubangi provinces.

Located in the north of the country, the province bordered the Republic of the Congo to the west, the Central African Republic to the north, to the east the Orientale province, and to the south the Kasai-Oriental, Kasai-Occidental, and Bandundu provinces.
The word &quot;Équateur&quot; is French for the Equator, which lies less than south of the provincial capital of Mbandaka, a city on the Congo River.

==History==

The District of Équateur was created by decree of Leopold II on 1 August 1888, which defined the limits of the Congo Free State and the eleven districts, including Équateur. 
The first district commissioners were named on 27 October 1888.
At first there was no commissioner for Equateur, but on 25 June 1889 the governor general placed Van Kerchhoven, successor to Camille Coquilhat, in command of the District of Ubangi and Uele based at Nouvelle-Anvers (formerly Bangala Station).
The first true head of Équateur was Charles-François-Alexandre Lemaire (1863-1925), appointed in December 1890.
He moved the district capital to the newly named Coquilhatville.

In 1908 the state of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State as the Belgian Congo.
In 1917 Équateur District became Équateur Province under Georges Moulaert (1875-1958), who became deputy governor general of the province on 20 August 1917.
In 1933 the province was renamed Coquihatville Province, under a provincial commissioner. 
The first commissioner was J. Jorrissen.
On 27 May 1947 the province regained the name of Équateur/Evenaar. It became an autonomous province of the Congo republic on 30 June 1960.
On 14 August 1962 Équateur was split into the provinces of Cuvette Centrale, Ubangi, and a centrally administered portion that became Moyen-Congo on 5 February 1963.

On 25 April 1966 Cuvette Centrale, Moyen-Congo and Ubangi were reunited as Équateur province.
In 2015 when it was again split under the terms of the 2006 Constitution, it formed five new provinces:
:Nord-Ubangi, consisting of 56.644 km², with its capital at the city of Gbadolite 
:Mongala, consisting of 58.141 km², with its capital at the city of Lisala
:Sud-Ubangi, consisting of 51.648 km², with its capital at the city of Gemena
:Équateur, consisting of 103.902 km², with its capital at the city of Mbandaka
:Tshuapa, consisting of 132.957 km², with its capital at the city of Boende

==Divisions==

Under the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the province was divided into the cities of Mbandaka, Gbadolite and Zongo and the districts of Équateur, Nord-Ubangi, Sud-Ubangi, Mongala and Tshuapa.

<doc id="446945" wikidata="Q1364290" url="?curid=446945" title="Debt restructuring">
<text>Debt restructuring is a process that allows a private or public company or a sovereign entity facing cash flow problems and financial distress to reduce and renegotiate its delinquent debts to improve or restore liquidity so that it can continue its operations.

Replacement of old debt by new debt when not under financial distress is called &quot;refinancing&quot;. Out-of-court restructurings, also known as s, are increasingly becoming a global reality.

== Motivation ==
Debt restructuring involves reduction of debt and an extension of payment terms and is usually less expensive than bankruptcy. The main costs associated with debt restructuring are the time and effort spent negotiating with bankers, creditors, vendors, and tax authorities.

In the United States, small business bankruptcy filings cost at least $50,000 in legal and court fees, and filing costs in excess of $100,000 are common. By some measures, only 20% of firms survive Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings.

Historically, debt restructuring has been the province of large corporations with financial wherewithal. In the Great Recession that began with the financial crisis of 2007–08, a component of debt restructuring called debt mediation emerged for small businesses (with revenues under $5 million). Like debt restructuring, debt mediation is a business-to-business activity and should not be considered the same as individual debt reduction involving credit cards, unpaid taxes, and defaulted mortgages.

In 2010 debt mediation has become a primary way for small businesses to refinance in light of reduced lines of credit and direct borrowing. Debt mediation can be cost-effective for small businesses, help end or avoid litigation, and is preferable to filing for bankruptcy. While there are numerous companies providing restructuring for large corporations, there are few legitimate firms working for small businesses. Legitimate debt restructuring firms only work for the debtor client (not as a debt collection agency) and should charge fees based on success.

Among the debt situations that can be worked out in business-to-business debt mediation are: lawsuits and judgments, delinquent property, machinery, equipment rentals/leases, business loans or mortgage on business property, capital payments due for improvements/construction, invoices and statements, disputed bills and problem debts.

== Methods ==
=== Debt-for-equity swap ===
In a debt-for-equity swap, a company&#x27;s creditors generally agree to cancel some or all of the debt in exchange for equity in the company.

Debt for equity deals often occur when large companies run into serious financial trouble, and often result in these companies being taken over by their principal creditors. This is because both the debt and the remaining assets in these companies are so large that there is no advantage for the creditors to drive the company into bankruptcy. Instead the creditors prefer to take control of the business as a going concern. As a consequence, the original shareholders&#x27; stake in the company is generally significantly diluted in these deals and may be entirely eliminated, as is typical in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Agreements to swap debt for equity also often occur because companies are obliged to comply, per the terms of a contract with certain lending institutions, with specified debt to equity ratios.

Debt-for-equity swaps are one way of dealing with sub-prime mortgages. A householder unable to service his debt on a $180,000 mortgage for example, may by agreement with his bank have the value of the mortgage reduced (say to $135,000 or 75% of the house&#x27;s current value), in return for which the bank will receive 50% of the amount by which any resale value, when the house is resold, exceeds $135,000.

=== Bondholder haircuts ===
A debt-for-equity swap may also be called a &quot;bondholder haircut&quot;. Bondholder haircuts at large banks were advocated as a potential solution for the subprime mortgage crisis by prominent economists:

Economist Joseph Stiglitz testified that bank bailouts &quot;are really bailouts not of the enterprises but of the shareholders and especially bondholders. There is no reason that American taxpayers should be doing this&quot;. He wrote that reducing bank debt levels by converting debt into equity will increase confidence in the financial system. He believes that addressing bank solvency in this way would help address credit market liquidity issues.

Economist Jeffrey Sachs has also argued in favor of such haircuts: &quot;The cheaper and more equitable way would be to make shareholders and bank bondholders take the hit rather than the taxpayer. The Fed and other bank regulators would insist that bad loans be written down on the books. Bondholders would take haircuts, but these losses are already priced into deeply discounted bond prices.&quot;

If the key issue is bank solvency, converting debt to equity via bondholder haircuts presents an elegant solution to the problem. Not only is debt reduced along with interest payments, but equity is simultaneously increased. Investors can then have more confidence that the bank (and financial system more broadly) is solvent, helping unfreeze credit markets. Taxpayers do not have to contribute dollars and the government may be able to just provide guarantees in the short term to buttress confidence in the recapitalized institution. For example, Wells Fargo owed its bondholders $267 billion, according to its 2008 annual report. A 20% haircut would reduce this debt by about $54 billion, creating an equal amount of equity in the process, thereby recapitalizing the bank significantly.

=== Other debt repayment agreements ===
Most defendants who cannot pay the enforcement officer in full at once enter into negotiations with the officer to pay by installments. This process is informal but cheaper and quicker than an application to the court. 
Payment by this method relies on the cooperation of the creditor and the enforcement officer. It is therefore important not to offer more than you can afford or to fall behind with the payments you agree. If you do fall behind with the payments and the enforcement officer has seized goods, they may remove them to the sale room for auction.

Subchapter V in the US was created in 2019 by the Small Business Reorganization Act (SBRA). It offers accelerated deadlines and the speed with which the plan is confirmed reduces cost. Congress temporarily increased the ceiling of maximum funded debt eligibility to $7.5mm during COVID-19, and extended it in 2022.

== In various jurisdictions ==

=== Canada ===
Two common avenues for restructuring debt exist in Canada: a Division 1 Proposal and a CCAA filing. The former is available to both corporations and individuals who owe $250,000 or more to creditors. The latter is available only to larger companies owing more than $5 million to their creditors.

A Division 1 Proposal is a last resort. Created by the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act of 1985, the option to file Division 1 is not an option to be taken lightly as, in the event that the stipulations within the proposal get voted down by creditors or not signed off by the court, one falls into bankruptcy. Division 1 proposals allow companies to be briefly relieved of lawsuits by creditors, as well as they allow companies to stop paying money to their unsecured creditors while the proposal is being reviewed. A Division 1 Proposal to restructure debts must secure 66% of the creditors&#x27; votes set in proportion to how much they are owed, and 50% plus one of all creditors votes in terms of number of creditors. On top of such democratic approval, the court itself has to approve how the debts get restructured. Withstanding all such approval, a business or individual can continue operating as normal; otherwise, a business or individual is obliged to proceed into bankruptcy filing.

CCAA filings were created by the Companies&#x27; Creditors Arrangement Act, a piece of legislation first put forward and passed in 1933 and updated later in 1985. A CCAA filing allows a Canadian company to have a window in time (typically between 30 and 90 days) in which they can renegotiate and reorganize their debt payment plans with creditors. During this brief period, creditors cannot seize any money that is owed to them. These windows of time may be renewed multiple times over. Once a CCAA application gets finally rejected, the company in question can be forced into receivership or bankruptcy. This could happen for a number of reasons, chief among them being a failure to come to an agreement with creditors as to how to restructure the debt.

=== Switzerland ===

Under Swiss law, debt restructuring may occur out of court, or through a court-mediated debt restructuring agreement that may provide for a partial waiver of debts, or for a liquidation of the debtor&#x27;s assets by the creditors.

=== United Kingdom ===
The majority of debt restructuring within the United Kingdom is undertaken on a collaborative basis between the borrower and the creditors (a company voluntary arrangement or individual voluntary arrangement). Historically, such a contract was called a composition with creditors. Should this be unsatisfactory in the first instance, the court may be asked to mediate and appoint administrators.

=== United States ===
Among the most common forms of in-court debt restructuring for firms in the United States are Chapter 11 and Chapter 12 bankruptcy.

Under Chapter 11, firms form a plan to reorganize their credit obligations, such that they are able to continue operating while they are going through with their debt repayment plans and after they become solvent. Creditors are given promises to be paid back with firms&#x27; future earnings. The nature of these promises can be shaped in a number of ways. In situations where every single impaired creditor of a firm agrees to a settled schedule of repayment, the plan formed is known as a &quot;consensual plan.&quot; When a certain class a firm owes does not accept a restructuring plan, said plan may still be approved pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code. Such plans are colloquially referred to as &quot;cramdown plans.&quot; Chapter 11 is considered to be one of the most expensive and complicated forms of bankruptcy to file. The vast majority of Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases filed end up allowing company management to go forward running the business as usual; however, in certain exceptional cases (fraud, gross incompetence, etc.) the courts do not allow the business the privilege of simply maintaining a &quot;debtor in possession&quot; status. In said cases, a trustee is appointed by the court to run the business until all bankruptcy proceedings are completed.

Chapter 12 Bankruptcy is a form of debt restructuring in the United States available to farms and fisheries exclusively; said businesses could be family-owned or owned by corporations. The special debt restructuring rights accorded to farmers and fisheries consequent line 12 of the United States Bankruptcy Code were first granted by Congress in 1986 amid an agricultural debt crisis. Food commodity prices were caught in a downward spiral in the years leading up to 1986, pushing U.S. farmers&#x27; debts to levels above $200 billion. This 12th line of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code was initially added only as a temporary measure and remained as a temporary measure until 2005, when it became permanent. Chapter 12 was of great benefit to farmers, because Chapter 11 was often too expensive for family farms and generally only useful for sizeable corporations, while Chapter 13 was mainly of use to individuals attempting to restructure very small debts. Farms and fisheries, being midsize and seasonal in nature, were thus in need of a more flexible legal framework through which they could restructure their debts.

Firms in the United States are not limited to only using the legal system to manage debts they are incapable of repaying. Out-of-court restructuring, or workouts, constitute consensual agreements between firms and their creditors to adjust debt obligations, mainly for the purpose of evading the costly legal fees associated with Chapter 11. The decision as to whether to enter a workout or take the issue into court is, in large a part, a function of the creditors&#x27; and debtors&#x27; respective perceptions of how much can be gained or lost through a Chapter 11 proceeding. Creditors know that once Chapter 11 has commenced, a degree of negotiating leverage is lost, as judicial authorities may impose alterations of claims without regard to creditors&#x27; consent. On numerous occasions, merely throwing out the threat of filing bankruptcy has initiated the process of coming to a private agreement.

=== Italy ===
Debt restructuring within Italy may occur either out of court (ex article 167 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law) when a waiver or simple debt rescheduling is required, or through a court-mediated debt restructuring agreement (ex article 182/bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law) and may provide for a partial waiver of debts, mandatory recapitalization of the debtor, or for a liquidation of certain debtor&#x27;s assets to repay privileged creditors.

=== Germany ===
While being famous for its efficiency in other matter, this is not true for debt restructuring. Many German companies prefer to restructure their debts using the English scheme of arrangement proceedings because they believe that the German restructuring law is not very helpful. The main reason for this is that binding a dissenting minority is only possible under formal insolvency proceedings in Germany.

== Corporate restructuring ==
As the incidence of corporate failures has increased in part due to current economic climate, so a more &quot;standard&quot; approach to restructuring has developed. Although every case has unique characteristics, the process of restructuring follows a number of important phases. Initially, declining financial performance will cause key financial covenants - for example, leverage ratios - along with the company&#x27;s underlying cash position to become tight and the prospect of the company needing to restructure will become more obvious to creditors and the debtor alike. This triggers a gathering of creditors and other stakeholders, in anticipation of a breach of financial covenants, a crisis of liquidity, or impending debt instruments coming due that will not be able to be refinanced, all of which could be the impetus for a bankruptcy taking place if not rectified.

The lending group (typically comprising corporate finance divisions of banks) will normally commission a corporate advisory group to review the business and its financial position. This will form the basis of any restructuring of facilities. The lending group will typically appoint a Corporate Restructuring Officer (CRO) to assist management in the turnaround of the business, and embracing the recommendations presented by the banking group and the corporate advisory report.

<text>Kasaï-Occidental (French for &quot;Western Kasai&quot;; ) was one of the eleven provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1966 and 2015, when it was split into the Kasaï-Central and the Kasaï provinces.

== History ==
The province of Kasaï-Occidental was established in 1966 by regrouping the provinces of Luluabourg and Unité Kasaïenne which in turn were created 1962 when the historical Kasaï Province was divided in five provinces namely Lomami, Sankuru, Sud-Kasai, Luluabourg, Unité-Kasaïenne. The former provinces of Luluabourg and Unité-Kasaïenne correspond to the current districts of Lulua District and Kasaï District. Since its formation the provincial seat is Kananga (formerly Luluabourg) which was also the seat of the Kasaï Province between 1957 and 1962. The Province of Lusambo precedes the current entity, it was created 1933 by carving out the districts of Kasai and Sankuru from the Province of Congo-Kasaï, one of the four provinces established in 1924. The province of Lusambo changed its name to Kasaï Province in 1947 its provincial seat was still Lusambo until 1957 when it was moved to Luluabourg (now Kananga). The Province of Kasai existed until it was subdivided in 1962 into 5 provinces.

The Province derives its name from the Kasai River which flows through the Kasaï District from south to north. The river is the second longest in DR. Congo and a major tributary of the Congo River. The Kasaï river was variously called Enzzadi, Nsadi, Nzadi, Kassabi, Kasye, Kassaba by the different local tribes (Luba, Tshokwe, Lunda, etc..), latter European explorers came to use the name Kasaï to refer to the river.

== Geography ==

Kasaï-Occidental borders the provinces of Bandundu to the west, Équateur to the north, Kasai-Oriental to the east, and Katanga to the southeast. To the south it borders the country of Angola. The province is crossed by many major rivers: Kasai, Lulua, Loango, Sankuru, Lukeni, etc...

== Divisions ==

The province is divided into the Kasaï and Lulua districts, with their headquarters in the towns of Luebo and Tshimbulu. Cities with independent administrations are Kananga in the Lulua district and Tshikapa in the Kasai district.
The Kasai district is divided in five territories:

Kamonia Territory seat Kamonia and is further divided in nine sectors:

* Bakwa-Nyambi
* Bapende
* Kasai-Kabambayi
* Kasai-Longotshimo
* Kasai-Lunyeka
* Kasadisadi
* Lovua-Longotshimo
* Lovua-Lushiku
* Tshikapa

The tshikapa sector should not be confused with the city of Tshikapa which is administered independently

Luebo Territory seat Luebo, divided in five sectors:

* Luebo
* Luebo-Kabambayi
* Luebo-Lulengele
* Luebo-Wedi
* Ndjoko-Punda
Mweka Territory seat Mweka; the entire territory is covered by one sector that of Bakuba.

Ilebo Territory seat Ilebo, divided in four sectors:

* Basongo
* Malu-Malu
* Mapangu
* Sud-Banga
Dekese territory seat Dekese, divided in two sectors:

* Ndengese-ikolombe
* Yaelima
Cities and towns, with their 2010 populations, are:

Under the 2006 constitution, Kasaï-Occidental was to have been divided into two provinces by 18 February 2009.
Kasai District and the city of Tshikapa were to combine and become a new Kasai Province, and Lulua District would be combined with the city of Kananga to form the new Lulua Province.
As of 24 May 2014, this had not taken place.

== Demographic ==

<text>Kasaï-Oriental (French for &quot;East Kasai&quot;) was one of the eleven provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1966 and 2015, when it was split into the new, smaller Kasai-Oriental province, the Lomami and the Sankuru provinces.

It borders the provinces of Kasaï-Occidental to the west, Équateur to the northwest, Orientale to the northeast, Maniema to the east, and Katanga to the south. Kasaï-Oriental is one of the richest diamond producing regions in the world. The provincial capital is Mbuji-Mayi.

==History==

Kasaï-Oriental is inhabited by members of the Luba people.

Congo obtained independence from Belgium in 1960. Friction with Congo&#x27;s other ethnic groups and encouragement by Belgian corporations hoping to keep their mining concessions led to the secession of the province of South Kasai as a separate state headed by Albert Kalonji.

After being repulsed, the Congo occupied the province in September 1961. Several thousand people were killed during the &quot;pacification&quot; of South Kasai, which lasted through the spring of 1962.

The population of Mbuji-Mayi grew rapidly with the immigration of Luba people from other parts of the country.

==Diamond mining==

The region in which Mbuji-Mayi is situated annually produces one-tenth in weight of the world&#x27;s industrial diamonds, with mining managed by the Société Minière de Bakwanga. This is the largest accumulation of diamonds in the world, more concentrated than those at Kimberley, South Africa. Mbuji-Mayi handles most of the industrial diamonds produced in the Congo.

==Political divisions==
The former Kasai-Oriental was divided into the three districts of Tshilenge, Kabinda, and Sankuru; and the two cities of Mbuji-Mayi and Mwene-Ditu. These were further divided into a total of 16 territories and 8 communes.

==Languages==
French is the official language. Tshiluba is one of the four national languages of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Tshiluba is spoken by about 6.3 million people in the Kasai region.

<doc id="446954" wikidata="Q723938" url="?curid=446954" title="Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland">
<text>Henry Richard Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland of Holland, and 3rd Baron Holland of Foxley PC (21 November 1773 – 22 October 1840), was an English politician and a major figure in Whig politics in the early 19th century. A grandson of Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland, and nephew of Charles James Fox, he served as Lord Privy Seal between 1806 and 1807 in the Ministry of All the Talents headed by Lord Grenville and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster between 1830 and 1834 and again between 1835 and his death in 1840 in the Whig administrations of Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne.

==Background and education==

Holland was born at Winterslow House, Wiltshire, the son of Stephen Fox, 2nd Baron Holland (1745–1774), and Lady Mary FitzPatrick, daughter of John FitzPatrick, 1st Earl of Upper Ossory, and Lady Evelyn, daughter of John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower. His paternal grandparents were Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland, and Lady Caroline Lennox, the eldest of the famous Lennox sisters and a great-granddaughter (through an illegitimate line) of King Charles II.

He succeeded in the baronies in December 1774, aged one, on the early death of his father, while his mother died shortly before his fifth birthday. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, where he became the friend of George Canning and John Hookham Frere. Lord Holland&#x27;s uncle was the great Whig orator Charles James Fox, and he remained steadily loyal to the Whig party.

==Political career==
On a visit to Paris in 1791, Holland became acquainted with Lafayette and Talleyrand. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 5 October 1796. According to the 1911 edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; he for a while &quot;almost... constituted the Whig party in the upper house&quot;. He was appointed to negotiate a treaty with American envoys James Monroe and William Pinkney, was admitted to the Privy Council on 27 August 1806, and on 15 October entered the Ministry of All the Talents led by Lord Grenville as Lord Privy Seal, retiring with the rest of his colleagues in March 1807.

Holland led the opposition to the Regency Bill in 1811, and he attacked the orders in council and other strong measures of the government taken to counteract Napoleon&#x27;s Berlin Decrees. He denounced the treaty of 1813 with Sweden which bound Britain to consent to the forcible union of Norway, and he resisted the bill of 1816 for confining Napoleon in Saint Helena. He was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster between 1830 and 1834 and 1835 and 1840 in the cabinets of Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne, and he was still in office when he died in October 1840.

== Ownership of slaves ==
With the Slave Compensation Act 1837 in the aftermath of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, the government paid compensation to former slaveholders. Lord Holland was compensated under three awards for slaves on his estates in Jamaica, which had come to him through his wife, Elizabeth Webster (née Vassall).

==Writings==

Holland&#x27;s protests against the measures of the Tory ministers were collected and published, as the &quot;Opinions of Lord Holland&quot; (1841), by Dr Moylan of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. &quot;Lord Holland&#x27;s Foreign Reminiscences&quot; (1850) contain much amusing gossip from the Revolutionary and Napoleonic era. His &quot;Memoirs of the Whig Party&quot; (1852; 2 vols.) is an important contemporary authority. He also published a small work on Lope de Vega (1806) and a 2-volume work (1817) on the lives and writings of Lope de Vega and Guillén de Castro. His whimsical short story &quot;Eve&#x27;s Legend&quot;, in which the only vowel used is the letter E, is considered a precursor to the constraints of the Oulipo school. 

==Family==
After visiting Paris in 1791 Holland again went abroad to travel in France and Italy in 1793. At Florence he met Elizabeth Vassall, at that time Lady Webster, wife of Sir Godfrey Webster, 4th Baronet. She and her husband obtained a divorce, and she married Holland on 6 July 1797, becoming Elizabeth Fox, Baroness Holland. An illegitimate son, Charles Richard Fox, was born to them. He later rose to become a General in the British Army.

They had three more children who survived infancy: the Hon. Stephen Fox (d. 1800), Henry Edward Fox, 4th Baron Holland, and Hon. Mary Elizabeth Fox, married to Thomas Powys, 3rd Baron Lilford. In 1800 he was authorised to take the name of Vassall, and after 1807 he signed himself Vassall Holland, though the name was no part of his title. Lord Holland died in October 1840, aged 66, and was succeeded in his titles by his eldest and only surviving legitimate son, Henry. Lady Holland died in November 1845.

==Vassall ward==
Vassall ward in the London Borough of Lambeth is named after Henry Richard Vassall-Fox who was responsible for the first building development in the area in the 1820s. Roads in the area such as Holland Grove, Lord Holland Lane, Foxley Square and Vassall Road commemorate this connection.

<doc id="446958" wikidata="Q130625" url="?curid=446958" title="North Kivu">
<text>North Kivu () is a province bordering Lake Kivu in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The capital city is Goma. Spanning approximately 59,483 square kilometers with a population estimate of 8,147,400 as of 2020, it is bordered by Ituri Province to the north, Tshopo Province to the northwest, Maniema Province to the southwest, and South Kivu Province to the south, as well as Uganda and Rwanda to the east.

North Kivu&#x27;s administrative history traces back to the colonial era when it was initially part of the Stanley Falls District within the Congo Free State. Following a series of territorial reorganizations, North Kivu became incorporated into Orientale Province, with Stanleyville (modern-day Kisangani) as the provincial capital. The area gained provincial status in 1962 but was demoted to a district under Mobutu Sese Seko&#x27;s regime in 1965. It was formally reinstated in 1988 under Ordinance-Law No. 88/1976 and Ordinance-Law No. 88-031, which redefined the previous Kivu Province into tripartite separate provinces: North Kivu, South Kivu, and Maniema. Presently, North Kivu comprises three cities—Goma, Butembo, and Beni—and six territories: Beni, Lubero, Masisi, Rutshuru, Nyiragongo, and Walikale. A 2013 decree also proposed city status for Kasindi, Oicha, and Luholu. The province&#x27;s eastern border is home to the Rwenzori Mountains, part of the Albertine Rift, which serves as a key freshwater source and supports a diverse ecosystem. North Kivu also hosts Virunga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site home to endangered mountain gorillas.

The province is confronted with ongoing security challenges stemming from armed groups, resource-related conflicts, and ethnic tensions. The Rwandan-backed M23 rebel group has been a significant source of instability. As of early 2024, M23-related violence had displaced approximately 1.7 million people, accounting for nearly 14% of North Kivu&#x27;s population.

North Kivu has also been the site of multiple outbreaks of the Ebola virus disease (including the most recent in August 2022) and was the center of the 2018–2020 Kivu Ebola outbreak, which was the second largest in history, resulting in over 3400 cases and 2200 deaths, following the 2014–2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak.

==Geography==

=== Relief ===

Situated along the equator, North Kivu spans latitudes from 0° 58&#x27; north to 2° 03&#x27; south and longitudes from 27° 14&#x27; west to 29° 58&#x27; east. Its topography ranges from less than 800 meters to peaks exceeding 5,000 meters in altitude, comprising diverse formations including plains, plateaus, and mountainous regions. Notable lowland areas include the alluvial plains of Semliki and Rwindi-Rutshuru, stretching from Lake Edward&#x27;s northern to southern shores. The steep Kabasha escarpment rises from Lake Edward&#x27;s western bank, extending toward the Rwindi-Rutshuru plain, which is flanked by the massive Ruwenzori range (5,119 meters) to the east. Further south, the plain merges into volcanic lava fields leading to the Virunga Mountains, with prominent active volcanoes Nyamulagira (3,056 meters) and Nyiragongo (3,470 meters).

=== Hydrology ===

The province features two major lakes: Lake Edward and Lake Kivu. Lake Edward, covering 2,150 square kilometers with 1,630 square kilometers in Congolese territory, reaches an average depth of 30 meters. It supports a rich fish population, forming a vital economic resource for surrounding communities. Lake Kivu, the highest lake in Central Africa, sits at an elevation of 1,460 meters, with a Congolese surface area of 2,700 square kilometers and an average depth of 285 meters. However, its fish diversity is relatively limited compared to Lake Edward. Additionally, the Mokotos Lakes—Ndalaha, Lukulu, Mbalukia, and Mbila—occupy 86 square kilometers in the Bashali Chiefdom. The provincial river system includes the Rutshuru, Rwindi, Semliki, Osso, and Lowa rivers.

=== Geology ===

Volcanic soils, derived from recent lava flows, dominate areas near active volcanoes; these soils, while fertile in older flows, are less suitable for agriculture in recent deposits. Between Goma and Rutshuru, volcanic soils are fertile yet shallow, conducive to agriculture. Alluvial soils are common in the Semliki plains, originating from lacustrine and fluvial deposits, while older, humus-rich soils are found in regions with deeper, clayey substrates, abundant in organic matter.

=== Vegetation ===
Savannas dominate the alluvial plains of Semliki and Rutshuru, while shrubby, sclerophyllous formations are found on the lava plains north of Lake Kivu. Mountain rainforests grow primarily in the Rwenzori and Virunga massifs, while equatorial forests are extensive in the territories of Lubero, Masisi, Walikale, and Beni.

Human activities have markedly influenced the province&#x27;s vegetation, particularly through establishing single-species plantations, mainly comprising &quot;Eucalyptus saligna&quot; and &quot;Grevillea robusta&quot;. These plantations, alongside community-operated village plantations, constitute the principal legitimate wood-energy sources for populations proximate to Virunga National Park. Additional species, such as &quot;Acacia mearnsii&quot;, are also cultivated, often interplanted with food crops to provide supplementary revenue streams for local populations. These monoculture plantations, extending over approximately 11,200 hectares, play an indispensable role in meeting the wood-energy demands of North Kivu&#x27;s residents, particularly in Goma. In 2011, the EcoMakala project emerged as a geographically integrated REDD+ initiative to mitigate emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Between 2020 and 2021, EcoMakala+ secured USD 1.3 million in funding, allowing North Kivu to become the first province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to capitalize on carbon credit sales.

=== Climate ===
North Kivu&#x27;s climate is greatly influenced by altitude. Temperatures decrease with elevation: areas below 1,000 meters average 23°C, while those at 2,000 meters average 15°C. Rainfall varies from 1,000 to 2,000 millimeters annually, with drier periods in January-February and July-August. The region experiences four distinct seasons: two wet seasons (mid-August to mid-January, mid-February to mid-July) and two short dry seasons. According to the Köppen-Geiger classification, North Kivu has a warm oceanic climate, with an annual average temperature of 18°C and average precipitation of 363.6 millimeters.

=== Administrative division ===
Approximate correspondence between historical and current province

North Kivu Province is systematically organized into a hierarchy of administrative divisions, which include territories, cities, chiefdoms (&quot;collectivités&quot;), sectors, &quot;groupements&quot; (groupings), and villages (&quot;localités&quot;).

==== Territories ====
North Kivu comprises six territories. These territories are led by a Territorial Administrator supported by two Assistant Territorial Administrators, who facilitate the effective governance of vast regions, often remote or rural. Appointed by the Ministry of the Interior and Security, territorial officials are part of the state&#x27;s official budget. They are responsible for implementing state policies at the local level, under the oversight of the provincial governor, who serves as both the President&#x27;s and Ministry&#x27;s representative within the province.

The territories in North Kivu include:

* Beni Territory
* Lubero Territory
* Masisi Territory
* Rutshuru Territory
* Nyiragongo Territory
* Walikale Territory

==== Cities ====
The province contains three cities—Goma, Butembo, and Beni. Each city is a decentralized administrative entity with official legal status and is led by a mayor appointed by a presidential decree on the advice of the Minister of the Interior and Security.

* Goma: As the provincial capital and largest city, Goma is the administrative and economic center of North Kivu. Located on the northern shore of Lake Kivu and near the Rwandan border, Goma is strategically important, though it faces challenges due to periodic volcanic eruptions from nearby Mount Nyiragongo and ongoing regional conflicts.
* Butembo: Situated in the northern part of North Kivu, Butembo is a major commercial hub. The city&#x27;s development, once spurred by the mining activities of the Compagnie Minière des Grands-Lacs (now SOMINKI), has positioned it as a significant center for trade, especially in agricultural products. It is well-connected to Eastern African countries through nearby transport infrastructure.
* Beni: Located in the northeastern part of the province, Beni spans an area of approximately 184.24 km2 at an elevation of about 800 meters. Although Beni serves as a crucial urban center, it has been affected by regional security concerns in recent years due to local conflicts.

==== Chiefdoms and sectors ====
The traditional governance of North Kivu is organized into chiefdoms, known as &quot;collectivités&quot;, and sectors. These entities represent traditional forms of authority, where leadership is often determined by ethnic customs and later formalized by the state. The head of a chiefdom holds the title &quot;mwami&quot; (paramount customary chief). Chiefdoms and sectors are divided into &quot;groupements&quot;, which further subdivide into villages. Village heads and chiefs manage governance within these smaller divisions.

Some notable chiefdoms and sectors in North Kivu include:
== History ==

The frontiers of the Congo Free State were defined by the Neutrality Act during the 1885 Berlin Conference, in which the European powers staked out their territorial claims in Africa. The Congo Free State&#x27;s northeastern boundary was defined in 1885 as &quot;a straight line coming from the northern end of Lake Tanganyika and ending at a point located on the 30th east meridian and at 1° 20&#x27; south latitude; further north, the border is formed by the 30th meridian east.&quot; On this basis, all of Lake Kivu and both banks of the Ruzizi River were in the Free State.

In June 1909, John Methuen Coote started the Kivu frontier incident when he travelled southwest from the British Uganda Protectorate and established fortified camps at Burungu and Rubona on Lake Kivu. British troops under Coote withdrew from the Rubona post on June 29, 1909, and the Belgians occupied the post. After a series of incidents, the boundaries of the Congo, Uganda and Rwanda were settled in May 1910, with the eastern part of Kivu assigned to Uganda and the German colony of Rwanda.

Kivu District was created by an &quot;arrêté royal&quot; of March 28, 1912, which divided the Congo into 22 districts. By 1954, Kivu District had been split into Sud-Kivu District and Nord-Kivu District.

=== First Congo War ===
==== Military escalation and refugee camp attacks ====

The First Congo War, which began in mid-October 1996, saw North Kivu become a focal point for intense military operations and humanitarian crises. The war marked the beginning of a campaign by the newly formed Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL), led by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, and the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), under Paul Kagame, to depose Mobutu Sese Seko&#x27;s regime in Zaire (present-day DRC). While the AFDL and RPA justified their incursion by accusing Mobutu of marginalizing the Tutsi population and harboring perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, alternate reports, including those from the United Nations Security Council, implicated both factions in the systematic looting of Zaire&#x27;s mineral wealth and perpetrating massacres throughout the conflict. At the onset, North Kivu hosted a significant population of Rwandan refugees, estimated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to number 717,991 in October 1996. Refugee camps, including Kibumba (194,986), Katale (202,566), and Kahindo (112,875), were strategically situated along the Rutshuru corridor north of Goma. Additional camps, such as Mugunga (156,115) and Lac Vert (49,449), were located westward on the Sake route. These camps, positioned near critical transit routes and the Rwandan border, became focal points of military confrontation.

On the evening of June 27, 1996, a clandestine Rwandan unit allegedly infiltrated the Kibumba refugee camp in Nyiragongo Territory, resulting in the deaths of three refugees, two soldiers from the Contingent Zaïrois pour la Sécurité des Camps (CZSC), and three Red Cross wardens. By October, the AFDL and RPA intensified their offensive, bombarding the Kibumba camp with heavy artillery on the night of October 25–26, leaving an indeterminate number of refugees dead and obliterating the camp&#x27;s hospital. Over 194,000 survivors fled toward Mugunga, while simultaneous assaults decimated Katale Camp despite initial resistance from Forces Armées Zairoises (FAZ)/CZSC personnel, ex-FAR combatants, and Interahamwe militias. Reports indicate several dozen refugees and one CZSC soldier were killed during the assault. By October 31, AFDL and RPA forces had reportedly executed hundreds of refugees who remained in Kahindo Camp. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights violations in Zaire, Roberto Garretón, later estimated 143 deaths at Katale Camp and between 100 and 200 deaths at Kahindo Camp.

==== Mass displacement and escalating violence ====
As the AFDL/RPA offensive escalated, fear and desperation prompted some refugees to attempt repatriation to Rwanda. Between October 26–31, approximately 900 refugees crossed the Mutura border, according to UNHCR records. However, this exodus was perilous, with numerous reports of intimidation, coercion, and outright killings by AFDL/RPA soldiers targeting those seeking assistance.

The scale of the violence against refugees became evident through reports from local organizations. NGOs such as the Équipe d&#x27;urgence de la biodiversité (EUB), the Association des Volontaires du Zaïre (ASVOZA), and the Zairean Red Cross documented the mass burials of victims to prevent outbreaks of epidemics. From November 2–30, 2,087 bodies were buried in and around the Kibumba camp. Between November 30, 1996, and January 26, 1997, an additional 1,919 bodies were buried in the same area. At Kahindo Camp, 281 bodies were buried between December 1–25, 1996. At Katale Camp, 970 bodies were buried between December 1, 1996, and January 18, 1997. According to the DRC Mapping Exercise Report, many of the victims&#x27; hands were bound, and bodies were often discovered in public pit latrines.

By November 1, 1996, all refugee camps between Goma and Rutshuru had been dismantled. The Kibumba camp&#x27;s survivors moved toward Mugunga, while those from Kahindo and Katale were scattered into the dense forests of Virunga National Park. Attempting to evade interception by AFDL/RPA forces, refugees wandered through the park&#x27;s inhospitable terrain for weeks. The volcanic landscape, marked by lava fields, offered little access to drinking water, leading to deaths from thirst and starvation.

==== Pursuit and targeted massacres ====
AFDL/RPA forces maintained relentless pressure on refugees. Checkpoints established between Mount Nyiragongo and Mugunga became sites of mass killings. Survivors reported that refugees intercepted at the park&#x27;s exit were sorted by age and gender, with adult males systematically executed. The violence extended to makeshift camps within Virunga National Park, where refugees who sought temporary shelter were targeted. By February 1997, reports from local witnesses indicated that bodies of newly deceased refugees were discovered daily near the former Kibumba camp. One of the most harrowing incidents occurred in April 1997 near Mwaro, close to the village of Kibumba. On April 9 AFDL/RPA soldiers intercepted refugees attempting to return to Rwanda. The victims were imprisoned in a mosque and a former farm building before being killed on April 11. The number of victims is unknown, but accounts suggest the massacre claimed several hundred lives.

==== Pursuit of refugees in Masisi Territory ====
In mid-November 1996, the Masisi Territory became a critical theater of pursuit and systematic violence as the AFDL and RPA advanced in their campaign. Their primary targets were refugees—mainly Rwandans—and ex-FAR/Interahamwe combatants fleeing westward towards Walikale. These columns of escapees, slowed by exhaustion and the harsh terrain, established temporary camps in villages across Masisi Territory, including Osso, Kinigi, Katoyi, Kilolirwe, Ngandjo, Nyamitaba, Miandja, Nyaruba, Kirumbu, and Kahira. Survivors from decimated camps such as Mugunga, Kibumba, Kahindo, and Katale were disproportionately represented among these disparate groups.

The assault on refugees and Internally displaced persons escalated on November 19, 1996, when Mayi-Mayi fighters aligned with AFDL/RPA forces attacked Ngungu village. Backed by artillery, they indiscriminately slaughtered an estimated several hundred refugees and ex-FAR/Interahamwe combatants. Reports from the United Nations and local witnesses indicate that no effort was made to distinguish civilians from combatants, with women and children among the fatalities. The following days saw continued massacres. In Osso, an improvised refugee camp adjacent to a local farm became a site of mass killing. Eyewitness accounts documented the presence of 20 to 100 bodies in the aftermath, though the actual death toll was likely higher. In early December 1996, AFDL/RPA forces attacked a makeshift camp in Mbeshe Mbeshe, Katoyi Chiefdom, killing hundreds of refugees and Zaireans indiscriminately. Survivors recalled the brutal nature of these assaults, with camps turned into death traps as soldiers opened fire on unarmed civilians.

On November 8, 1996, survivors from Kahindo and Katale camps settled in Bashali Chiefdom, only to face renewed attacks by AFDL/RPA soldiers. Around November 18, these forces stormed a makeshift camp at Rukwi, killing an indeterminate number of refugees in a protracted series of raids that spanned weeks and months. In late November, atrocities were reported in Miandja, where AFDL/RPA units killed approximately 50 civilians, including 40 Rwandan refugees and 10 local Hutu Banyarwanda. Refugees who had established settlements at Karunda in Kirumbu village and on the Nyabura plantation in the Bashali-Mokoto &quot;groupement&quot; faced a similar fate. In April 1997, AFDL/RPA forces attacked a school in the village of Humule, near Karuba—roughly fifty kilometers from Goma—killing 53 refugees. Further violence followed in May 1997 when AFDL/RPA units intercepted a group of refugees heading to the Karuba UNHCR transit center, where they hoped to facilitate their return to Rwanda. On May 29, four people, including a child and an employee of the international NGO Save the Children, were killed in the village of Karuba.

==== Systematic violence against Hutu refugees in Walikale Territory ====
In November 1996, Walikale Territory became a critical transit point and deadly trap for Rwandan refugees fleeing the advancing AFDL and RPA. Refugees arrived in the area via three routes: one from Bukavu through Bunyakiri; another through the dense forests of Kahuzi-Biéga National Park and Nyabibwe; and a third from North Kivu, passing through southern Masisi Territory and the towns of Busurungi and Biriko. While armed men in these groups often managed to escape, the slowest refugees—mainly women, children, and the elderly—became the primary targets of the AFDL/RPA&#x27;s systematic attacks. On December 9, 1996, the AFDL/RPA forces unleashed one of their deadliest massacres at the Hombo Bridge, where they shot dead several hundred refugees. Many of the victims were women and children. In the following days, soldiers committed further atrocities near Kampala, a town close to Hombo. Refugees were burned alive along the road, while many women were subjected to sexual violence before being killed.

In Chambucha, four kilometers from Hombo, soldiers intercepted several hundred refugees, including a significant number of women and children, and executed them near the Lowa River. Victims were killed either by gunfire or by brutal methods involving hammers and hoes. Deceptively lured with promises of UNHCR assistance for repatriation, most of the victims&#x27; bodies were discarded in the Lowa River. By mid-December 1996, AFDL/RPA forces advanced on the makeshift camps in Biriko, located in the Walowa-Luanda &quot;groupement&quot;. Refugees here were surrounded by soldiers from Ziralo and Bunyakiri in South Kivu and Ngungu in North Kivu. Hundreds of refugees, including women and children, were killed in the Biriko camps through shootings or by being bludgeoned with hoes. Locals were forced to bury some of the victims, while others were discarded in the Nyawaranga River.

The violence then spread to nearby villages, including Kilambo, Busurungi, Nyamimba, and Kifuruka. In Kifuruka, located 10 kilometers from Biriko, several hundred refugees were reportedly killed in December 1996. During the third week of December 1996, AFDL/RPA units committed mass killings in Musenge, a locality between Hombo and Walikale. Hundreds of refugees were executed as part of a broader system of targeted extermination. A similar system was implemented in Itebero, where special units systematically hunted down refugees throughout December 1996. In Mutiko locality, refugees intercepted at checkpoints were transported to Mukito village under the pretense of being prepared for UNHCR-assisted repatriation. However, the victims were instead led to their deaths, being killed with sticks, hammers, and axes. Indigenous residents were coerced into participating in the killings and were later forced to bury the bodies. In the Nyarusukula district of Walikale, which had been transformed into a restricted military zone, hundreds of refugees were killed. Civilians were prohibited from entering the area, and most of the victims&#x27; bodies were disposed of in the Lowa River and its tributaries. In early 1997, more killings were reported at the Kariki makeshift camp, 13 kilometers from Walikale. Refugees who sought safety here became easy targets for the AFDL/RPA forces, and most of the victims&#x27; bodies were left unburied.

=== Second Congo War ===

The Second Congo War profoundly affected North Kivu, as conflict erupted due to deteriorating relations between President Laurent-Désiré Kabila, Rwanda, and Tutsi soldiers within the AFDL. By late 1997, tensions mounted as Kabila faced allegations of marginalizing Tutsi factions in his government and favoring his Katangan affiliates. Other reports suggested that the United States provided military assistance to Rwanda in the lead-up to the war, ostensibly motivated by access to Congo&#x27;s vast natural resources. A U.S. Army Rwanda Interagency Assessment Team (RIAT) was deployed to Rwanda in July 1998 to train Rwandan units. The presence of U.S. forces sparked controversy, as it coincided with the outbreak of hostilities in the DRC. American photojournalist and war correspondent Keith Harmon Snow asserted that Roger Winter, a key figure in the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, orchestrated U.S.-endorsed insurgencies in Congo and neighboring states, including Rwanda, Sudan, and Uganda. In July 1998, driven by fears of a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, President Laurent-Désiré Kabila relieved Rwandan General James Kabarebe of his position as Chief of Staff of the AFDL, while also issuing an order for the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) soldiers to withdraw from Congolese territory. These actions provoked Rwanda and Uganda to support a new rebellion aimed at removing Kabila from power. On August 2, 1998, a mutiny within the Congolese military, the &quot;Forces Armées Congolaises&quot; (FAC), was announced on Radio-Télévision Nationale Congolaise (RTNC) in Goma. The mutiny led to the formation of the Rassemblement Congolais pour la Démocratie (RCD-Goma), a Tutsi-dominated rebel group supported by Rwanda. On the same day, the city of Goma fell into the hands of RCD-Goma and RPA without significant resistance. Goma remained under rebel control for nearly three years, from August 1998 to January 2001.

On February 25, 1999, RCD-Goma and RPA forces massacred 45 civilians in Lukweti, Masisi Territory. Subsequent airstrikes by the FAC in May 1999 targeted Goma neighborhoods, including Mukosasenge in Karisimbi, resulting in civilian casualties. Around August 8, 1999, RCD-Goma and RPA killed at least 17 civilians in the village of Otobora in Walikale Territory, many of whom were displaced persons from the neighboring village of Hombo. On August 12, 1999, RCD-Goma and RPA killed 44 civilians in the village of Miano in Masisi Territory, predominantly women and children of Tembo ethnicity. Victims were targeted based on their ethnic origin. Around November 23, 1999, RCD-Goma and RPA killed an unknown number of civilians in the village of Ngenge in Walikale Territory, indiscriminately opening fire on residents. On November 24, RCD-Goma and RPA soldiers beat a group of senior figures in the village to death. The same soldiers &quot;killed civilians in the neighboring villages of Kangati and Kaliki&quot;. On February 5, 2000, at least 30 people were killed by RCD-Goma and RPA forces in the village of Kilambo, Masisi Territory. A local NGO identified 27 victims.

During this period, members of the ALiR (&quot;Armée pour la Libération du Rwanda&quot;) also attacked civilians in Walikale Territory and Masisi Territory. In January 2000, ALiR forces killed approximately 100 civilians in the village of Luke, Walikale Territory, accusing them of collaborating with RCD-Goma and RPA forces. Most of the victims were killed with machetes or shot. On July 9, 2000, ALiR attacked a displaced persons&#x27; camp in Sake, killing 34–42 civilians, mostly women and children of Hunde and Tembo ethnicity.

==== Mass killings and civilian attacks in Goma and surrounding territories ====

===== UPDF operations and Mayi-Mayi resistance =====

On August 7, 1998, the Uganda People&#x27;s Defence Force (UPDF) took control of Beni without opposition. However, this occupation provoked substantial local resistance, with youth in Beni and Lubero joining the Mayi-Mayi groups. Strengthened by financial and military support from the Kinshasa government, the Mayi-Mayi launched attacks on UPDF convoys and engaged in violent confrontations with Ugandan forces.

These clashes were further compounded by internal rivalries within Mayi-Mayi factions, notably between Chief Lolwako Poko Poko&#x27;s Vurondo Mayi-Mayi and Chief Mudohu&#x27;s forces. Efforts by the RCD-ML (Rally for Congolese Democracy–Liberation Movement) to incorporate these groups into its armed wing, the &quot;Armée Patriotique Congolaise&quot; (APC), failed, leading to intensified violence. In August 2000, confrontations between Vurondo Mayi-Mayi fighters and APC/UPDF troops in Lubero resulted in dozens of deaths, including civilians. Reports indicate that 17 civilians were killed, and seven Mayi-Mayi prisoners were summarily executed.

===== Civilian killings and village attacks =====

In retaliation for Mayi-Mayi ambushes, UPDF forces launched indiscriminate attacks on villages suspected of harboring Mayi-Mayi fighters. These operations frequently involved mass civilian killings, destruction of property, and other acts of brutality. On November 1, 2000, UPDF soldiers reportedly executed between 7 and 11 civilians in Maboya and Loya, 16 kilometers north of Butembo, while setting ablaze 43 houses. Victims were either shot or burned alive. On November 8, 2000, close to the village of Butuhe, 10 kilometers north of Butembo, Vurondo Mayi-Mayi attacked a UPDF convoy escorting lorries transporting minerals. Similarly, on November 9, 2000, UPDF soldiers attacked the village of Kikere, close to Butuhe, killing 36 civilians with rifles and rocket launchers and systematically destroying homes and livestock. The UPDF&#x27;s reign of terror in Beni included arbitrary arrests, torture, and the execution of civilians. Detainees were often held in inhumane conditions, such as being confined in deep holes exposed to the elements. Protests against these abuses were met with lethal force, such as in March 2000, when UPDF soldiers killed four civilians during a demonstration in Beni.

===== Atrocities by ADF-NALU =====
The Allied Democratic Forces–National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (ADF-NALU), an armed group based in the Ruwenzori Mountains, also committed widespread atrocities in Beni. In 2000, ADF-NALU forces kidnapped, enslaved, and killed hundreds of civilians. In January, they abducted over 100 people in Mutwanga, and in April, they attacked surrounding villages, forcibly recruiting children and enslaving women. Many victims endured malnutrition, physical abuse, and execution during captivity, with some forced to carry looted property over long distances.

==== Escalation of violence against ethnic groups ====
In November 2002, RCD-Goma launched an assault on Bushimoo village in the Bashali-Mokoto &quot;groupement&quot;, killing an unverified number of people from the Hunde ethnic group. During the same period, Mayi-Mayi forces under Hunde&#x27;s leadership retaliated by torching multiple Nyanga villages in the same region, resulting in further casualties and displacement. The cycle of violence intensified in January 2003, as RCD-Goma forces conducted coordinated attacks on the villages of Bushimoo, Kauli, and Binyungunyungu. Over three days (January 21–23), RCD-Goma troops indiscriminately killed civilians, set villages ablaze, and committed acts of sexual violence. A particularly egregious attack occurred on January 22 when approximately 15 civilians were executed on a bridge over the Osso River. On February 25, 2003, RCD-Goma forces orchestrated a massacre in Bushimoo and Kailenge, killing at least 44 civilians. The attack was deceitfully executed under the guise of a community meeting meant to introduce a new village leader—an ex-Mayi-Mayi who had defected to RCD-Goma. The atrocities extended into the Walikale region. In April 2003, RCD-Goma forces killed five civilians and tortured two women near Kabusa, approximately ten kilometers from Walikale. In June 2003, seven inhabitants of Lukweti were executed with bayonets, and their village was systematically looted.

The indigenous Twa communities in North Kivu suffered disproportionately during this period. Accused of collaborating with various armed factions, the Twa people were subjected to repeated attacks by both RCD-Goma soldiers and FDLR. Crimes against the Twa people included rape, arbitrary detention, and other inhumane acts rooted in both ethnic prejudice and superstitious beliefs. In March 2003, RCD-Goma forces gang-raped numerous Twa women in Mubambiro, near the Virunga National Park, an atrocity echoed in September 2003 in the nearby village of Mudja. Both incidents were marked by degrading treatment and indiscriminate abuse.

==== Beni and Lubero areas ====
In 2001, the Beni and Lubero regions in North Kivu became entrenched battlegrounds as various factions, including RCD-ML, Mayi-Mayi groups, UPDF, and elements of the FDLR, fought for territorial control. These conflicts were characterized by widespread violence against civilians, including extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, and systemic looting. Under the RCD-ML&#x27;s control, its armed wing, the Armée Populaire Congolaise (APC), was implicated in atrocities targeting civilian populations. In Kiantsaba, a village near Beni, APC forces killed at least five civilians and razed homes. Meanwhile, APC troops, in coordination with the UPDF, clashed with Mayi-Mayi militias in the village of Irango. During these confrontations, the UPDF reportedly committed mass killings, sexual violence against young girls, and extensive property destruction, including arson and looting. The UPDF&#x27;s presence in Beni extended beyond military confrontations. For several years, Ugandan forces established a brutal regime, characterized by arbitrary detention, torture, and summary executions. Civilians were often confined in inhumane conditions, including detention in muddy pits several meters deep. North of Kanyabayonga, the FDLR targeted civilians across several villages, including Kayna, Mayene, Nyamindo, Kisandja, and Kiteka. The attacks often involved killings, harassment, and forced displacement.

=== Conflict-driven mineral exploitation ===
During the Second Congo War, military control over natural resources, particularly coltan, became a lucrative enterprise for the Rwandan-backed rebel group RCD-Goma. Although a decline in coltan prices led to a reduction in direct Rwandan army management of certain mining sites, their vested interest in the coltan trade remained high, with RCD-Goma and other political entities actively participating. RCD-Goma facilitated substantial revenue flows from coltan; however, even greater profits were channeled to Rwanda, as military officials and Rwandan authorities diverted significant quantities of coltan across the border.

From January to October 2000, coltan exports from Rwandan-controlled eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo exceeded 445 tonnes, according to RCD-Goma&#x27;s records. In late 2000, the organization implemented an export monopoly and declared 208 tonnes of coltan exports over the next two months. Accounting for both formal and clandestine transfers to Rwanda, annual production in the Kivu provinces likely reached between 1,400 and 1,700 tonnes in 2000. Estimates suggested that more than $60 million was directed to local trading houses (&quot;comptoirs&quot;) during the peak months of the trade, while the Rwandan army reportedly accrued upwards of $250 million over an 18-month period from coltan exported to Rwanda. These profits largely benefitted Rwandan and RCD-Goma military elites, business figures, and other individuals with ties to the Rwandan government.

The Rwandan army&#x27;s extraction and transfer operations were organized and controlled by senior commanders stationed in key territories such as Walikale and Masisi. Checkpoints were established to monitor and restrict civilian access to mining areas, while major towns and airstrips became stockpiling sites for coltan awaiting air or road transport. To facilitate these operations, new airstrips were built, and military helicopters, along with contracted companies such as Swala Express, Bukavu Air Transport, and Kivu-Air, transported coltan from remote mining zones directly to Rwanda, where state-operated facilities were used to store the mineral. Return flights often carried arms and equipment back into the DRC. Civilian flights, which previously allowed local miners to sell coltan to local trading houses, were halted by military authorities to consolidate control over the trade.

Civilians in military-controlled mining areas were frequently coerced into forced labor, and even paid miners had to sell their output to army officials at considerably reduced rates. Additionally, Rwandan soldiers served as private security for foreign-owned mining concessions, receiving a share of profits in exchange for their protection. Although some coltan passed through local trading houses, the majority was flown directly to Rwanda, bypassing the DRC&#x27;s export system.

Rwandan military officers and entrepreneurs linked to the government were prominently represented as directors and stakeholders in key trading houses in Goma and Bukavu, such as Grands Lacs Metals and Rwanda Metals. These trading houses collaborated with the Rwandan government&#x27;s Congo Desk, facilitating the direct export of coltan to international markets. Despite the eventual downturn in coltan prices, military transfers persisted, as illustrated by October 5, 2002, seizure of 36 tonnes of coltan belonging to Rwanda Metals in Tanzania. The DRC government accused Rwanda Metals of looting resources from the DRC, though the company contested the claim, asserting the coltan was mined domestically. Although the Tanzanian High Court dismissed the case, the provenance of the seized coltan remains uncertain.

RCD-Goma, despite its self-appointed administrative authority, lacked the logistical and military resources necessary for extensive control over mining areas, as exercised by the Rwandan army. Nevertheless, it capitalized on the coltan trade by imposing numerous taxes and fees, including mining license charges, non-refundable deposits, export taxes, and a &quot;war effort tax&quot;, which escalated alongside coltan prices. RCD-Goma also held a controlling 75% interest in the Société Minière des Grands Lacs (SOMIGL), which held a temporary monopoly on coltan exports, generating immediate revenue surges. In December 2000, the 112 tonnes of exported coltan brought in over $1.1 million in taxes; however, none of these funds were allocated toward public services like healthcare or education.

The monopoly was dissolved in April 2001 due to the Rwandan army&#x27;s disregard for RCD-Goma&#x27;s control, withholding of stocks by trading houses, and a decline in tantalum prices. Letters from RCD-Goma officials expressed concern over revenue losses due to direct coltan exports to Rwanda by Rwandan forces. Monthly exports, estimated at 46 tonnes and valued at up to $21 million on the global market. RCD-Goma also capitalized on its authority by selling coltan concessions, even those under the legal ownership of the Canadian-based gold exploration and development company Banro Corp or the DRC government. In February 2001, an RCD-Goma committee awarded Medival Minerals Ltd., a Swiss company, an 18-month contract for cassiterite extraction in various concessions. In eastern DRC, coltan is often mislabeled as cassiterite to circumvent higher tantalum-related duties. Under this arrangement, the committee received 20% of the sale price, with RCD-Goma providing security.

==== Mass killings and civilian attacks ====

Civilians residing in coltan-rich areas such as Punia, Kindu, Shabunda, Masisi, and Walikale suffered from frequent attacks. These incidents involved both targeted killings and indiscriminate violence against entire communities. Villages were razed, and large areas were depopulated as residents fled to escape the brutality. For example, in early May 2001, residents of Kabale, in Masisi Territory, were forced to flee into the forest due to clashes between the Rwandese army and the Mayi-Mayi militia. When some villagers attempted to return, Rwandan soldiers opened fire, killing multiple civilians, including a young family and an infant.

==== Forced labor in coltan mines ====
The demand for coltan also led to the systematic use of forced labor, often involving children. Reports indicate that in April 2001, Rwandan soldiers forced children and adults to work in mining operations in Masisi Territory. Mining sites at Mumba and Rugeshe in the Lwundje &quot;groupement&quot; of the Osso Sector in Masisi Territory became scenes of forced labor, with soldiers using violence to compel local populations to work.

In one notable case, a Congolese human rights activist who went to investigate labor practices at a coltan mine was detained and forced to work alongside other civilians. He later recounted that up to 200 civilians, including a large number of children, were being made to work under harsh conditions, often threatened with bayonets and rifle butts.

==== Displacement and destruction of villages ====

The conflict over coltan resources also led to widespread displacement, as forces destroyed villages and expelled residents from their homes. Between April and October 2001, thousands of people were forcibly displaced in the Osso Sector around Mahanga when RCD-Goma and Rwandan forces sought control of mining areas. The displaced faced extreme hardships, with inadequate access to food, shelter, and sanitation, resulting in additional deaths due to disease and starvation.

In some cases, residents were gathered in inadequate shelters, such as a school in Mahanga, where they were left without humanitarian aid. Many of the displaced perished.

==== Specific incidents of targeted Killings ====
Several targeted killings occurred throughout the conflict, often motivated by accusations of collaboration with opposition forces or mere association with the coltan trade. On May 25, 2001, Saasita Babaoni, a Congolese employee at a coltan comptoir in Masisi, was killed in his office by a Rwandan soldier. Despite prior threats and complaints, Rwandan authorities failed to act, and the perpetrator faced no accountability.

Another significant incident occurred on August 28, 2001, when Rwandan soldiers detained a trader near Punia, forcing him to transport an RCD-Goma combatant and subsequently detaining him in a &quot;cachot souterrain&quot;, a pit used as a makeshift prison. That night, the trader witnessed the soldiers execute six other detainees, accused of collaborating with the Mayi-Mayi.

==== Impact on women, children, and vulnerable populations ====

The violence and forced labor associated with coltan mining disproportionately affected women, children, and other vulnerable populations. Many children were conscripted into labor in dangerous mining conditions, with frequent use of physical violence to enforce compliance. Women and the elderly, often unable to flee quickly, became victims of targeted violence, as illustrated by the murders near Bongbenyama and Fakiri, where 20 elderly villagers, women, and children were killed during raids.

=== Ongoing conflict ===
On August 19, 2003, DRC government decree 019/2003 offered Laurent Nkunda the rank of Brigadier General and command of the new Congo Government&#x27;s FARDC Eighth Military Region, covering North Kivu. He declined. On May 26, 2004, General Obed Wibasira (RCD-Goma) was named to the position. But Wibasira was suspected of complicity with the soldiers in Goma who had triggered a mutiny in Bukavu in February 2004, and on January 23, 2005, he was switched with Gabriel Amisi Kumba, at the time commander of the Fifth Military Region in Kasaï-Oriental. Kumba was named as a Brigadier General when taking up the post. General Louis Ngizo, a former commander of the Rally for Congolese Democracy, was appointed a commander in November 2006. Brigadier General Vainqueur Mayala was transferred from command of the Ituri operational zone, promoted to Major General, and appointed military region commander in May 2007. Ngizo left Goma on May 13, 2007, his next posting not being known at the time. During late 2008, the FARDC maintained its dismal record in combat against Nkunda&#x27;s CNDP faction, losing the Rumangabo military camp to the rebels.

The dissident Mai-Mai 85th Brigade, commanded by Colonel Samy Matumo, controlled the cassiterite mine at Bisie, just north of Manoire in Walikale, in southeastern North Kivu. The former RCD-K/ML also has fighters in the province; at the beginning of the transition [2002-3] the RCD-Mouvement de Libération president declared he had 8-10,000 Armée Patriotic Congolaise (APC) troops in the Beni-Lubero area of North Kivu.&#x27; This exaggerated figure seems to have been reduced to &#x27;several thousand&#x27; (2-4,000?) as of early 2006, following demobilizations and men joining the integrated brigades.

The Effacer le tableau and Beni massacre occurred in the province.

==Economy==

=== Agriculture ===

Subsistence agriculture is North Kivu&#x27;s most significant economic activity, employing over 90% of its population. Key food crops include cassava, maize, plantains, sweet potatoes, peanuts, yams, soybeans, paddy rice, cowpeas, and wheat, while industrial crops such as oil palm, rubber, tea, quinine, coffee, coconut, pyrethrum, papaya, and cocoa also thrive. North Kivu ranks among the leading producers of premium-grade papaya worldwide and, along with South Kivu, is one of the only provinces producing tea in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The province&#x27;s agricultural activities extend into livestock, particularly in cattle, sheep, goat, pig, and poultry farming, as well as to the fishing industry, with abundant fish-filled rivers in Walikale and the western parts of Beni and Lubero territories.

=== Mining ===
North Kivu is rich in mineral deposits. The province contains a variety of deposits, such as gold, silver, monazite, cassiterite, columbo-tantalite (coltan), wolframite (tungsten oxide), diamonds, pyrochlore, zirconium, quartz, tourmaline, platinum, and phosphate, spread across different territories. Gold deposits are located in Beni, Lubero, Masisi, and Walikale, while silver is found in all territories except Nyiragongo. Rutshuru and Masisi contain cassiterite reserves, whereas coltan is mined in Lubero, Masisi, and Walikale. Pyrochlore—a mineral used in various industrial applications—is extracted from Beni and Rutshuru, with SOMIKIVU responsible for its extraction. Walikale Territory stands out as a major mining hub, known for the Bisie mine&#x27;s cassiterite production.

==== Artisanal and semi-industrial mining practices ====
Artisanal mining, a labor-intensive and low-technology approach, dominates the sector, particularly in Lubero&#x27;s sites like Manguredjipa, Bunyatenge, and Kasugho, as well as Beni&#x27;s Cantine and Mabalako. In Walikale, artisanal mining prevails except for Bisie, which stands as a semi-industrialized operation. Managed by South African and Canadian firms MPC and Alpha Mine, the Bisie mine represents a shift towards more industrialized methods, focusing primarily on cassiterite extraction. The Masisi Territory, notable for coltan extraction, also engages in semi-industrial mining led by the Congolese company Société Minière de Bisunzu SARL (SMB).

=== Infrastructure ===
The province&#x27;s economic infrastructure is a blend of essential services and transport networks that facilitate trade and daily operations. The Goma International Airport is the primary aviation gateway, while Lake Kivu serves as a vital transport route, connecting North Kivu with regional markets. The province&#x27;s road network spans approximately 5,134 kilometers, with a combination of national, provincial, and agricultural roads, although maintenance challenges often hinder connectivity. Key state-owned enterprises (SOEs) like SNEL (&quot;Société Nationale d&#x27;Électricité&quot;) and REGIDESO provide electricity and water services, primarily to Goma, with limited supply extending to other urban centers. The port of Goma and its quays, operated partially by SNCC (&quot;Société Nationale des Chemins de fer du Congo&quot;), support riverine commerce, while private entities like Congo Maji SARL and Yme Jibu provide supplementary water services through standpipes and home connections.
==== Major companies in the province ====
=== Tourism ===
Tourism is anchored by the ecologically rich Virunga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its endangered mountain gorillas and diverse wildlife. This attraction, along with various nature reserves, forms the backbone of the province&#x27;s tourism industry. Efforts to enhance local energy infrastructure, notably through Virunga SARL&#x27;s hydroelectric operations around Virunga National Park, and companies like Nuru and Energie du Nord Kivu (ENK) developing solar mini-grids, aim to provide stable power, particularly for Goma and Butembo.

== Government ==
North Kivu&#x27;s governing system encompasses political and security oversight, judicial and administrative management, as well as economic and financial administration.

=== Political and security ===
The political governance framework of North Kivu includes provincial deputies. The provincial government is led by a governor and includes several members. Key policies, such as the provincial civil service edit and Order No. 01/012/CAB/GP-NK/2009, regulate local and provincial governance structures. Security in North Kivu is managed by provincial security forces.

==== Elections ====
The Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) has established offices in key cities, including Goma, Beni, and Butembo, as well as across the six territories of North Kivu. The Provincial Executive Secretariat, headquartered in Goma, coordinates electoral processes throughout the province to ensure the organization of both direct and indirect elections.

=== Administrative and judicial ===
The judicial governance structure is supported by the Groupe Thématique Justice et Droits Humains (GTJDH), encompassing both civil and military judicial systems. The Provincial Justice Division is responsible for managing penitentiary institutions, notarial services, and oversight of State Guards and Educational institutions (&quot;Garde et de l&#x27;Éducation de l&#x27;État&quot;). Judicial services are distributed through the Court of Appeal in Goma, several public prosecutor&#x27;s offices, High Courts, Peace Courts, Commercial Courts, and military courts.

==== Decentralization and customary affairs ====
North Kivu&#x27;s administrative structure adheres to the national constitutional framework. The province is organized into various Decentralized Territorial Entities (&quot;Entités Territoriales Décentralisées&quot;; ETD), comprising three cities—Goma, Butembo, and Beni—and ten communes, along with seven sectors. Customary leadership also plays a part in governance at the local level, consisting of ten chiefdoms, 97 &quot;groupements&quot;, and 5,178 villages.

Provincial administration is organized through various divisions that report either to the national government or the provincial government.

=== Economic and financial ===
Economic governance has seen substantial reforms aimed at enhancing fiscal management and revenue generation. A steering committee supervises the province&#x27;s public finance reforms, alongside key departments like the Budget Directorate and the General Directorate for Public Procurement Control (&quot;Direction Générale du Contrôle des Marchés Publics&quot;, DPCMP). Legal frameworks, such as Edit No. 002/2013, regulate provincial tax collection, and a directory of taxpayers has been created to streamline revenue mobilization.

==== Public finances, planning, and budgeting ====
The province&#x27;s public finances operate through decentralized services, with national agencies like DGDA (&quot;Direction Générale des Douanes et Accises&quot;), DGI (&quot;Direction Générale des Impôts&quot;), and DGRAD (&quot;Direction Générale des Recettes Administratives, Judiciaires, Domaniales et de Participations&quot;) collecting revenues on behalf of the central government, while the Provincial Directorate of Revenue (Direction Générale des Recettes de Nord-Kivu) manages local revenue collection. The Planning Division coordinates economic and social development initiatives, working with partners like UNICEF on hygiene, water, and sanitation projects.

==== State Portfolio ====
The central government maintains a presence in North Kivu through provincial branches of various state-owned enterprises, including SNEL, REGIDESO, SONAS, SNCC, FPI, RVA, LAC, OCC, SONAHYDROC, OR, DVDA, and others.

==Demography==
Demographically, North Kivu is ethnically diverse, predominantly inhabited by Bantu-speaking people, including the Nande, Mbuba, Hunde, Lese, Talinga, Hutu, Tutsi, and Batwa (pygmies). North Kivu contains around 20 tribes or ethnic groups, and 60% of its population is made up of Nande.

==Human rights issues==
In October 2007, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) warned of an increasing number of internally displaced people (IDP) in North Kivu related to the fighting there between the government army, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) rebels and renegade troops, including Laurent Nkunda&#x27;s forces, and a buildup of military supplies and forces, including recruitment of child soldiers by armed groups across North Kivu. The UNHCR thought that there were over 370,000 people in North Kivu displaced since December 2006, and is expanding its camps in the Mugunga area, where over 80,000 IDPs were estimated. The brief capture of Goma by M23 rebels caused &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of refugees. The town of Sake was abandoned.

<text>South Kivu (; ) is one of 26 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Its capital is Bukavu.

Situated within the Great Rift Valley, South Kivu is bordered by Lake Kivu, Burundi, and Tanzania to the east; Maniema Province to the west; North Kivu Province to the north; and Tanganyika Province to the south. Covering an extensive area of approximately 65,070 square kilometers (25,120 square miles), it is administratively divided into eight territories and boasts a population of roughly 7,066,400 in 2020.

The province&#x27;s topography is an amalgamation of geographical features comprising mountains, forests, waterfalls, and plains. The area boasts an array of wildlife species, including mountain gorillas, chimpanzees, African Forest Elephants, lions, giraffes, and vervet monkeys. It also hosts African buffalos, baboons, clawed frogs, dwarf crocodiles, savannah monitors, gray duikers, common agamas, and endangered eastern lowland gorillas. The province&#x27;s national parks and nature reserves, such as Kahuzi-Biéga National Park and Itombwe Nature Reserve, are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

South Kivu is a melting pot of various ethnic groups, including the Shi, Fuliiru, Bembe, Vira, Lega, Nyindu, Holoholo, Bwari, Hunde, Nyanga, Amba, Swaga, Shu, and Mbuti. The region is also home to a small fraction of Hutu and Tutsi agro-pastoralists who were transplanted by Belgian colonial authorities in the mid-20th century.

Since the First Congo War, the region has been plagued by armed conflicts and civil unrest. During the First and Second Congo Wars, it became a battleground for the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL), the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), and the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD). The presence of multiple armed groups in the area has led to insecurity, instability, and humanitarian crises. The conflict has resulted in the displacement of civilians, human rights abuses, and atrocities against the local population. Additionally, the region&#x27;s rich natural resources, such as minerals and timber, have been a driving factor for some of the conflicts.

==History==
South Kivu Province was created from Sud-Kivu District in 1989, when the existing Kivu Province was divided into three parts (South Kivu, North Kivu and Maniema).

=== Conflict and insecurity ===

==== First Congo War ====

For three decades, the region has been plagued by armed conflicts and violence. Various armed groups and militias have operated in the area, leading to displacement, human rights abuses, and the disruption of essential services.

At the outset of the First Congo War, South Kivu played a key role as a battleground for the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL), led by Laurent-Désiré Kabila. Its plateaus and hills served as strategic strongholds for the advancing AFDL forces, who aimed to pursue Hutu refugees, particularly the ex-FAR/Interahamwe, while simultaneously seeking to overthrow Mobutu&#x27;s government. This response was prompted by the mistreatment of Tutsi civilians under Mobutu&#x27;s regime, which subjected them to arbitrary arrests and detentions conducted by Zairian police and soldiers.

The AFDL&#x27;s pursuit of Hutu refugees led to widespread violence and atrocities. The AFDL forces, resorting to indiscriminate killings, mass executions, and acts of torture, initiated the First Congo War with a massacre in the Lemera &quot;groupement&quot; (grouping) of South Kivu, on October 6, 1996. The massacre claimed the lives of several dozen individuals. In a hospital massacre, 37 individuals, including two medical personnel, were killed. On October 20, 1996, the AFDL forces killed an unknown number of refugees and Zairian civilians in Rubenga, a village in South Kivu. Another attack occurred on October 21, 1996, in Lubarika village, where an unknown number of Rwandan and Burundian refugees, along with Zairian civilians, were killed by the AFDL forces. Local people were coerced into burying the bodies in four large mass graves. In Kamanyola, on October 20, 1996, the AFDL forces killed an unknown number of refugees and Zairian civilians, disposing of their bodies in pit latrines. The AFDL persisted in launching attacks on South Kivu&#x27;s refugee camps, rivers, airports, and densely populated villages. They carried out civilian executions and acts of terrorism against Zairian civilians in various locations, including Nyantende, Bukavu, Lwakabiri, Kashusha, Ulindi River, Kigulube, Ivela, Balika, Kavumu Airport, Lulingu, and Keisha. In May 1997, the AFDL gained control over significant parts of the country and captured the capital, Kinshasa. Mobutu fled the country and Laurent-Désiré Kabila assumed leadership, renaming the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

==== Second Congo War ====

From late 1997 onwards, the relationship between President Laurent-Désiré Kabila, Rwanda and the Tutsi soldiers present in the AFDL deteriorated. Laurent-Désiré Kabila&#x27;s government faced multiple accusations of marginalizing Tutsi political factions, excluding them from his administration, and displaying preferential treatment toward his Katanga clan. In July 1998, driven by fears of a coup d&#x27;état, President Laurent-Désiré Kabila relieved Rwandan General James Kabarebe of his position as Chief of Staff of the AFDL, while also issuing an order for the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) soldiers to withdraw from Congolese territory. In response, on 2 August 1998, a faction of Tutsi soldiers mutinied and, with the assistance of the AFDL, the Banyamulenge militias, the Ugandan army (Ugandan People&#x27;s Defence Force; UPDF), and the Burundi army (&quot;Forces Armées Burundaises&quot;; FAB), launched a rebellion aimed at overthrowing President Laurent-Désiré Kabila. Within a few weeks, this coalition formed the &quot;Rassemblement Congolais pour la Démocratie&quot; (RCD) and gained control over major urban centers in North and South Kivu, Orientale Province, North Katanga, and even managed to penetrate into the Équateur Province. The war resulted in wide-scale displacement, famine, and a staggering loss of lives. Numerous rebel groups and militias emerged, further intensifying the violence and leading to pervasive human rights violations, including large-scale massacres and incidents of sexual violence.
On August 6, 1998, factions of the ANC/RPA/FAB perpetrated a massacre, claiming the lives of numerous civilians in Uvira, in South Kivu. As civilians sought shelter or attempted to flee the combat zone, they fell victim to the FAC in confrontations, resulting in hundreds of fatalities. Moreover, on the same day, members of the ANC, the armed wing of the RCD rebel, killed 13 people, including the chief of the Kiringye area, in the village of Lwiburule in South Kivu. Another massacre unfolded as elements of the ANC/RPA claimed the lives of 15 individuals in the vicinity of Kivovo, Kigongo, and Kalungwe, all situated in South Kivu. The victims suffered from dagger wounds or were shot near the primary port in Kalundu and at the facilities of SEP Congo. On August 24, 1998, RCD forces and Rwandan soldiers unleashed a massacre in Kasika and neighboring villages in South Kivu, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,000 people, as reported by the United Nations Mapping Report. The majority of the recovered bodies, predominantly women and children, were discovered on the 60-kilometer journey from Kilungutwe village to Kasika. Prior to their murders, the women were subjected to rape followed by brutal disembowelment using daggers. From December 30, 1998, to January 2, 1999, RCD forces committed another massacre, claiming the lives of over 800 civilians, primarily belonging to the Babembe community, in the small village of Makobola in South Kivu. Many victims endured machete attacks or were shot at close range, while others met their demise through burning or drowning in nearby rivers. Infants and young children were callously thrown into deep pit latrines, left to perish, while adults who dared to disobey orders and attempted to escape were met with bullets. On May 14, 2000, members of the ANC conducted a massacre resulting in 300 deaths in the village of Katogota in South Kivu.

The war officially ended in 2003 with the signing of the Sun City Agreement, which aimed to establish a transitional government and promote peace and stability in the DRC. However, sporadic violence and conflicts in the region persisted even after the official end of the war.

==== War and human rights ====
The Banyamulenge, who actively aligned themselves with the AFDL and RCD factions throughout the duration of the Second Congo War, have been subject to widespread disdain among many Congolese due to their alleged involvement in a range of nefarious activities. These accusations include launching assaults on refugee camps and densely populated villages, engaging in civilian executions, and orchestrating acts of terrorism targeting Zairian civilians across various regions of South and North Kivu. Consequently, a considerable number of Congolese view the Banyamulenge as unwelcome intruders encroaching upon their native territories, thereby intensifying the deep-rooted animosity directed towards them.

The UN estimates that in 2005, approximately 45,000 women were raped in South Kivu. It forms various armed groups, including the Rwandan-backed armed groups, Banyamulenge armed groups, Raia Mutomboki, Mai-Mai militias, ADF (Allied Democratic Forces) and FDLR. There have been numerous accounts and allegations of sexual violence perpetrated by members of the Congolese army (&quot;Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo&quot;; FARDC) in eastern Congo. The 10th Military Region of the newly established Congolese military, led by General Pacifique Masunzu, whose undisciplined former factional soldiers are responsible for human rights violations due to a continuing culture of impunity for military personnel, compounded by challenging living conditions, inadequate remuneration, and insufficient training.
Masunzu is Munyamulenge (South Kivu Banyamulenge Tutsi) who broke with the Rwandan-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) back in 2003. He was formerly commander of the 122nd Brigade in the Minembwe area, who in 2005 rebelled against the authorities in defence of the Congolese Banyamulenge, against harassment and physical abuse. Also previously former second in command of 4th Military Region in Kasai-Occidental. Africa Confidential said in 2011 that he &#x27;clearly remains implacably opposed to the Rwandan government.&#x27; His deputy Colonel Baudouin Nakabaka is a former Mai-Mai fighter with close links to the FDLR. In July 2007, United Nations human rights expert Yakin Erturk called the situation in South Kivu the worst she has ever seen in four years as the global body&#x27;s special investigator for violence against women. Sexual violence throughout Congo is &quot;rampant,&quot; she said, blaming rebel groups, the armed forces and national police. Her statement included that &quot;Frequently women are shot or stabbed in their genital organs, after they are raped. Women, who survived months of enslavement, told me that their tormentors had forced them to eat excrement or the human flesh of murdered relatives.&quot;

In June 2014, around 35 people were killed in an attack in the South Kivu village of Mutarule. The attack was apparently part of dispute over cattle.

On 7 August 2015 the 2015 South Kivu earthquake, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake, struck north-northeast of Kabare at a depth of . One policeman was killed.

On July 16, 2020, the Ngumino and Twiganeho militias of the Banyamulenge community perpetrated the Kipupu massacre, which claimed the lives of 220 people in South Kivu village of Kipupu, as reported by provincial lawmakers.

==Geography==
South Kivu borders the provinces of North Kivu to the north, Maniema to the west, and Tanganyika to the south. To the east, it shares borders with Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania, forming part of the African Great Lakes region. The province is predominantly mountainous, with the western side of the Albertine Rift Valley running through its territory. This creates a series of peaks and valleys, including the Mitumba Mountains and the Kahuzi-Biéga National Park, which is home to endangered mountain gorillas and lush bamboo forests. South Kivu also boasts several notable lakes, including Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika. In addition to its mountains and lakes, the province also features a network of rivers and dense tropical rainforests. The major rivers in the province include the Ruzizi, which forms part of the border with Burundi, and the Ulindi River, which flows into Lake Tanganyika. The rainforests of South Kivu are part of the Congo Basin, one of the world&#x27;s largest tropical rainforest systems. These forests are teeming with biodiversity, housing a wide variety of plant and animal species. They provide habitat for endangered wildlife, including chimpanzees, forest elephants, and various species of primates. The region is also rich in natural resources, including minerals like gold, coltan, tin, and tungsten.

=== Hydrology ===
South Kivu Province is characterized by numerous rivers, lakes, and waterways that crisscross through its landscapes. The region lies in the center of the African Great Lakes, encompassed by Lake Kivu towards the west and sharing its border with the Virunga National Park on the east. The Ruzizi River, one of the longest rivers in the world, flows along the province&#x27;s eastern edge. Meanwhile, its tributaries—the Sange, Kavinvira, Kavimvira, Luvimvi, Luvungi, Luvubu, Luberizi, Runingu, Mulongwe, Kiliba, Kalimabenge, and Lugulu Rivers—run through the verdant terrains, nurturing the surrounding ecosystems and supporting farming activities.

The province is home to several lakes, including Lake Tanganyika which serve as critical sources of freshwater and habitats for diverse aquatic species.
While the province is rich in natural resources, it is also fraught with challenges and dangers. The area is susceptible to periodic floods, particularly during the rainy season, which cause disruptions to both the community and infrastructure. Over the last few years, parts of the province have been ravaged by flooding. In March 2020–23, torrential rains and the overflow of nearby tributaries inundated homes, including the Sange and Uvira, located in Uvira Territory. These regions experienced severe flooding, resulting in a sudden surge of water that overwhelmed the local infrastructure and communities. The force of the floodwaters led to the collapse of many houses, leaving families homeless and vulnerable. The aftermath of the flooding also led to the displacement of people who sought refuge in temporary shelters or with relatives in safer areas.

Similarly, other areas in South Kivu Province also faced the wrath of floods, including Nyambasha, Bushushu, Rambira, and Nyamukubi in Kalehe Territory. These communities, situated in low-lying areas near rivers and water bodies, are particularly susceptible to the destructive impact of flooding. Heavy rains and rising water levels overwhelm local infrastructure and defenses, causing homes to collapse and forcing residents to flee for safety.

=== Geology ===

The province houses many volcanoes, including Mount Kahuzi, Mount Muhi and Mount Kabobo. These volcanoes are part of the larger Virunga Mountains, which stretches from Uganda through Rwanda and into the DRC. The province also includes parts of the Albertine Rift, a branch of the larger East African Rift System. This rift valley is characterized by tectonic forces that led to the stretching and thinning of the Earth&#x27;s crust, resulting in the formation of deep valleys and steep escarpments. The rift valley is associated with the presence of lakes, including Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika, which are major features of the landscape in South Kivu Province. In addition to volcanic and rift valley formations, the province also contains sedimentary basins. These basins, such as the Lake Kivu Basin, are areas where layers of sediment have accumulated over time. They are important for their mineral resources, including deposits of diamonds, gold, copper, cobalt, tin, tantalum and lithium.

=== Climate ===
The province&#x27;s eastern mountainous region experiences a mild mountain climate with a 3 to 4-month dry season from June to September. Cities like Bukavu and Uvira maintain an average annual temperature of 19 °C, while higher plateaus and mountains, such as Minembwe and Kahuzi-Biéga National Park, are even cooler, fostering layered and grassy mountain vegetation.

Conversely, the central and western parts, including territories like Shabunda and Mwenga, feature an equatorial climate dominated by dense equatorial forests, with abundant rainfall throughout the year. The Ruzizi Plain, however, presents a unique micro-climate—a tropical climate with a dry tendency and lower rainfall (± 1,000 mm/year). The region&#x27;s vegetation is characterized by a grassy savannah with thorns and &quot;Myrtillocactus geometrizans&quot;, most notably in the Kahuzi-Biéga National Park.

== Administrative divisions ==
===Approximate correspondence between historical and current province===

South Kivu Province, like all other provinces, is administratively divided into territories and cities. Further subdivisions of territories are: chiefdoms or sectors, &quot;groupements&quot; (groupings), and villages.
=== Territories ===

Territories serve as the extensive arms of state administration, functioning as representatives of the central government. Each territory within the province is led by a Territorial Administrator and two Assistant Territorial Administrators. Recognizing the vastness of the territories, administrative management positions are established, headed by resident assistant territorial administrators or administrative management position leaders, aiming to bridge the gap between governance and the governed. Appointed by the Ministry of the Interior and Security, territorial officials are included in the state&#x27;s budgetary provisions. While they directly report to the Ministry of the Interior, they are also accountable to the governor, who acts as the representative of both the President in the province and the Ministry of the Interior. The primary role of territorial administrators is to represent the state at the local level and oversee chiefdoms (&quot;collectivités&quot;).

South Kivu Province is divided into eight territories:
* Fizi (15,788 km²), capital &quot;Fizi&quot; town; 
* Idjwi (281 km²), this is an island in Lake Kivu; 
* Kabare (1,960 km²), 
* Kalehe (5,126 km²),
* Mwenga (11,172 km²),
* Shabunda (25,116 km²),
* Uvira (3,148 km²), capital &quot;Uvira&quot; town; 
* Walungu (1,800 km²),

===Cities===
The city is a decentralized administrative unit with legal status. Cities are led by mayors appointed by presidential decree, as advised by the Ministry of the Interior and Security. The mayor has a deputy mayor, appointed in the same way. The mayor is under the hierarchical authority of the provincial governor. South Kivu has three main cities of significance: Baraka, Bukavu (the provincial capital), and Uvira. The northern town of Minova expanded rapidly from 1994 to 2012 with a steady inflow of refugees following the Rwandan genocide as well as both First and Second Congo Wars, along with ongoing regional conflicts.

The city of Bukavu has experienced an exponential urban growth since colonial times. Sadiki et al. (2010) report about 620,000 inhabitants for 2008. The population growth rate increased incredibly in 2002 due to the entry of massive population from Goma after the Nyiragongo eruption of 17 January 2002.

=== Chiefdoms and sectors ===

Traditional authority is vested in chieftaincies, also known as collectivities (&quot;collectivités&quot;) and sectors. The selection of the powerholder within a chiefdom or sector is determined by ethnic traditions and later recognized or formalized by the state, following traditional norms. The leader of a chiefdom carries the honored title of &quot;mwami&quot; (king). The chiefdom is further subdivided into &quot;groupements&quot; (groupings), which extend the reach of traditional authority to regrouped villages (&quot;localités&quot;). Village heads and chiefs manage administrative and governance duties in their respective areas.

Some of the notable chiefdoms and sectors in South Kivu:
==== &quot;Groupements&quot; and villages ====
===Health districts===
South Kivu is divided into 34 health zones (&quot;zones de santé&quot;). These are grouped into five health districts (&quot;districts de santé&quot;). These districts do not match the geography of the territories.

<text>Orientale Province () is one of the former provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its predecessors the Congo Free State and the Belgian Congo. It went through a series of boundary changes between 1898 and 2015, when it was divided into smaller units.

The District of Orientale Province was created from Stanley Falls District on 15 July 1898.
The district was expanded to become Orientale Province in 1913. It was divided in 1933 into Costermansville (later Kivu) and Stanleyville Province. Stanleyville Province was renamed Orientale Province from 1947 to 1963, when it was broken up into Kibali-Ituri, Uélé and Haut-Congo provinces. Orientale Province was reconstituted in 1966. Between 1971 and 1997 it was called Haut-Zaïre, then it returned to the name of Orientale.
The province contained the Bas-Uele, Haut-Uele, Ituri and Tshopo districts. These were elevated to provinces in 2015 under the 2006 constitution.

The province lay in the northeast of the country. Originally it bordered Équateur to the west, Congo-Kasaï to the southwest and Katanga to the south. After being reduced in size, it bordered Équateur to the west, Kasaï-Oriental province to the southwest, Maniema to the south, and North Kivu to the southeast. It also bordered the Central African Republic and South Sudan to the north, and Uganda to the east. The provincial capital was Stanleyville, later renamed Kisangani.

==History==

On 15 July 1898 the Stanley Falls District became the District of Orientale Province (District de la province Orientale), with Stanleyville as its headquarters.
The Lualaba District in the south was split off at this time.
The district was also called Stanleyville District.
In 1910 the new vice-government general of Katanga was formed the south, with parts of Lualaba District and parts of Stanleyville.

Orientale/Oost Province was formed in 1913 in the Belgian Congo from the District of Orientale Province, expanded to include Haut-Uélé, Bas-Uélé and Aruwimi.
The new province contained the districts of Bas-Uele, Haut-Uele, Ituri, Stanleyville, Aruwimi, Maniema, Lowa and Kivu.
It was divided in 1933 into Costermansville (later Kivu) and Stanleyville Province. Stanleyville Province was renamed Orientale/Oost Province from 1947 to 1963, when it was broken up into Kibali-Ituri, Uélé and Haut-Congo provinces. Orientale Province was reconstituted in 1966 from the amalgamation of the Uele, Kibali-Ituri and Haut-Congo provinces. In 2015 it was dissolved into the provinces of Bas-Uélé, Haut-Uélé, Ituri and Tshopo.

In 1998 the Orientale villages of Durba and Watsa were the center of an outbreak of Marburg virus disease among gold mine workers.

The Ituri district of Orientale was the scene of the Ituri conflict.

As of 2014, militia groups continue to fight in the province and have reportedly committed many atrocities against the local population, such as forcing women into sex slavery and forcing men to work in mines.

<text>American James McGee (born December 13, 1972) is a retired American video game designer. He is best known as the designer of &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot;, its sequel &quot;&quot;, and his works on various video games from id Software.

==Early life==
American James McGee was born on December 13, 1972, in Dallas, Texas to an eccentric mother who was a house painter. His only interaction with his biological father was on his 13th birthday, a meeting which turned violent as McGee&#x27;s father drunkenly assaulted him that night. McGee was highly creative and was gifted in mathematics and science, taking an early interest in computer programming. He was eventually accepted to a magnet school for computer science.

In explaining where his name came from, McGee has said that his mother was a hippie and was inspired by a woman she knew in college that named her child &quot;America&quot;:

McGee had a number of stepfathers when growing up until his mother finally settled into a relationship with a trans woman. When McGee was sixteen, he came home from school and found his house empty and abandoned; the only things left were his bed, his books, his clothes and his Commodore 64 computer. His mother had sold the house to pay for two plane tickets and the fee for her girlfriend&#x27;s gender confirmation surgery, leaving him on his own. He packed up his computer, dropped out of high school and took a variety of odd jobs, finally settling on a Volkswagen repair shop.

==Career==
===id Software===
At 21, McGee, an automobile and gaming enthusiast, moved to an apartment complex where he met and befriended John Carmack. Carmack offered McGee a tech support job at id Software, where he was quickly promoted to level designer and music manager. McGee, along with Kevin Cloud and Tim Willits, were part of id Software&#x27;s &quot;second generation&quot; of developers, working on games such as &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom II&quot;, &quot;Quake&quot; and &quot;Quake II&quot;.

In 1998, McGee was fired from id Software. Later, McGee would say that the day he got fired was very meaningful to him:

According to former id staff Sandy Petersen, Tim Willits was the one responsible for McGee&#x27;s firing (although he did not mention Willits by name; referring to him only by &quot;Snake&quot; and &quot;X&quot;). Allegedly, during the development of &quot;Quake II&quot;, Willits deliberately gave bad level design advice to McGee and when he presented his work to Carmack, it angered him and McGee was fired soon after. McGee has stated to this day, he still has no idea why he was fired but acknowledged the fact that it was due to &quot;internal politics and my own failings&quot;.

===Electronic Arts===
McGee soon joined Electronic Arts and worked as creative director on &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot; (with Rogue Entertainment), which garnered favorable reviews. Discussions began soon after the game&#x27;s release about making a film adaptation of the game; initially Wes Craven was attached to direct the film, and later actress Sarah Michelle Gellar bought the film rights, but the film has remained in development hell.

After finishing &quot;Alice&quot;, McGee left EA &quot;in frustration&quot; when the company fired his creative partner R. J. Berg and shut down Rogue Entertainment. In 2002, McGee founded the short-lived Carbon6, which two years later became known as Mauretania Import Export Company.

===The Mauretania Import Export Company===
McGee directed the 2002 music video for the song &quot;Same Ol&#x27; Road&quot; by the band dredg, from their album &quot;El Cielo&quot;. Partnering with Enlight Software and its founder Trevor Chan, McGee released the games &quot;Scrapland&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Bad Day L.A.&quot; in 2006.

McGee backed the Nintendo &quot;Wii&quot; as the &quot;only truly next-gen console in same year.&quot;

===Spicy Horse===

The planned &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Oz&quot;, which was to be produced in conjunction with Ronin Games, was canceled over financial difficulties at Atari. &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Grimm&quot;, developed by his Shanghai-based game development studio Spicy Horse for the online service GameTap, was released in 23 weekly episodic segments, starting in 2007.

At the 2009 D.I.C.E. Summit, Electronic Arts CEO John Riccitiello announced that a sequel to &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot; was in development for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 by McGee&#x27;s Spicy Horse studio. In July 2010, at the EA Showcase in San Francisco, Spicy Horse and EA announced that sequel&#x27;s title, &quot;&quot;, released less than one year after its announcement, on June 14, 2011.

More recently, McGee&#x27;s Spicy Horse expanded to include another brand, Spicy Pony, to produce digital mobile media games for the iPhone platform. Their first title, &quot;DexIQ&quot;, was released in early December 2009, and its follow-up, &quot;Crooked House&quot;, was released in March 2010 (both had iPad versions released in June 2010). On December 17, 2010, McGee&#x27;s old company The Mauretania Import Export Company was dissolved and all intellectual property was transferred to Spicy Horse.

In 2012, McGee was focusing on free-to-play games for mobile devices with BigHead Bash, Akaneiro, and Crazy Fairies. In 2013, he opened a Kickstarter for a new game, &quot;American McGee&#x27;s OZombie&quot;; however, due to slow/lackluster funding the project was canceled. Another Kickstarter for a project called &quot;&quot;, a planned series of short films leading to a theatrical film, was announced a few days later. This reached its goal on August 4, 2013, and was officially confirmed.

===&quot;Alice: Asylum&quot;, cancellation and retirement===
In September 2017, McGee announced that he was working on a license proposal for &quot;Alice: Asylum&quot;, the third installment of the &quot;Alice&quot; franchise. McGee and his small team began working on a pitch book of &quot;artwork, design outline, and financial/business model&quot; which would be sent to EA upon completion. The pitch book was partially funded through the membership platform Patreon, and presented to EA in early 2023. 

McGee announced in April 2023 that EA ultimately rejected approving &quot;Alice: Asylum&quot; for both production and licensing after receiving McGee&#x27;s pitch. Furthermore, McGee announced that even if EA were to reconsider their stance with production of the game in the future, he was not interested in being involved in future &quot;Alice&quot; projects.

He also announced his retirement from game development, with plans to focus on his family and their family business Mysterious.

==Personal life==

McGee has stated his mission is &quot;to create a unified production method for story telling across the interactive and film industries&quot; and of himself, he says, &quot;I want to be the next Walt Disney, only a little more wicked.&quot;

In 2005, McGee left the United States and resided for a time in Hong Kong before moving to Shanghai, where he has lived since 2009. Once in China, he created Spicy Horse, at one point the largest independent Western game development house in the nation, and helped found Blade (formerly Vykarian), a game outsourcing company. They produced &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Grimm&quot; for GameTap (now owned by Metaboli) and worked on the sequel to his original &quot;Alice&quot; game, &quot;&quot;.

He also mentions that his inspiration for the macabre tone of &quot;Alice&quot; comes from his disturbing, dysfunctional childhood.

McGee continues to live in Shanghai with his wife, Yeni Zhang. The couple co-founded Mysterious, Inc., a company that markets art, apparel, and accessories based on McGee&#x27;s works, with McGee&#x27;s wife Yeni overseeing the designs. 

The couple has two children.

One of McGee&#x27;s favorite books is Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft&quot;.

McGee had a sister, Mercy Covington, who was reported missing on November 10, 2015. As of January 2024, her case remains unsolved.

<text>Pride Toronto is an annual event held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in June each year. A celebration of the diversity of the LGBTQ community in the Greater Toronto Area, it is one of the largest organized gay pride festivals in the world, featuring several stages with live performers and DJs, several licensed venues, a large Dyke March, a Trans March and the Pride Parade. The centre of the festival is the city&#x27;s Church and Wellesley village, while the parade and marches are primarily routed along the nearby Yonge Street, Gerrard Street and Bloor Street. In 2014, the event served as the fourth international WorldPride, and was much larger than standard Toronto Prides.

The event is organized by Pride Toronto, a non-profit organization. A growing complement of fourteen staff support the work of 22 festival teams; each team is responsible for an aspect of the festival. Each team was formerly administered by two or three volunteer team leads; in 2019, the decision was made to strip that down to one lead per team in favour of a staff-centered approach. The long-term vision for, and strategic oversight of, the organization and the festival is intended to be managed by 12 volunteers on the board of directors. As of March 2020, the board consists of six members.

The first parade occurred in June 1981. For most of its history, Pride was a seven-to-ten day festival centred on the final week in June, with the parade falling on either the last weekend in June or the first weekend in July depending on the year&#x27;s circumstances. Since 2016, the entire month of June has been declared Pride month, with a program of events throughout the month leading up to the parade.

Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, the organization&#x27;s in-person Pride festivities for 2020 and 2021including the Trans March, the Dyke March and the Pride paradewere cancelled. Virtual Pride Month festivities and an online &quot;parade&quot; took place in both years.

The organization&#x27;s executive director since 2020 is Sherwin Modeste. He succeeded Olivia Nuamah, who had been appointed in February 2017 to succeed Mathieu Chantelois.

==Festival overview==

Main events of Pride Toronto&#x27;s festival include the Trans March, the Dyke March and the Pride parade. Although a definitive count of attendees cannot be determined, estimates in recent years have ranged from 500,000 to over one million for the week, and about 100,000 for the parade itself. The festival is often touted as being one of the largest cultural festivals in North America and the 22 city blocks that make up the festival site is closed to vehicular traffic.

==History==

Toronto&#x27;s Pride Week evolved out of the mass protests that followed the 1981 Toronto bathhouse raids, and celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2005. In the 2005 parade, newly appointed Toronto police chief Bill Blair became the first chief of police in the city&#x27;s history to personally take part in the parade. He marched alongside politicians of all parties, including several federal and provincial cabinet ministers and Mayor David Miller.

A theme is selected for each Pride festival that reflects the current context of the queer community and helps shape the festivities. Previous themes included &quot;Fearless&quot; (2006), &quot;Unstoppable!&quot; (2007), &quot;Unified&quot; (2008), &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop. Won&#x27;t Stop.&quot; (2009), &quot;+&quot; (2017).

===World Pride 2014===

At the 28th annual conference of InterPride, held in October 2009 in St. Petersburg, Florida, the InterPride membership voted to accept the bid of Pride Toronto to host WorldPride 2014 for the first time in North America. In the first round of voting, Toronto won 77 votes compared to Stockholm&#x27;s 61. In the second and final round of voting Stockholm was eliminated and Toronto won 78% of the vote, fulfilling the 2/3 majority needed to finalize the selection process. WorldPride 2014 in Toronto included an opening ceremony with concerts at Nathan Phillips Square; an international human rights conference; a variety of networking and social events including Canada Day and Independence Day celebrations, and an exhibition commemorating the 45th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots.

Pride Toronto officials said that Pride Week 2009 drew an estimated one million people to Toronto and contributed C$136 million to the city&#x27;s economy, and state that they expect WorldPride to be significantly bigger. The actual numbers turned out to be closer to 2 million visitors. Economic impact was first reported at $286 million in 2014 and later updated to $719 million.

==Controversies==
===Commercialization and marginalization===
Toronto Pride Week has not been without controversy, as the growth of the event in recent years has led to allegations that it has become an overly commercial enterprise dependent on corporate sponsors and business interests, to the detriment of local community groups and political activism. Although Pride officially defines itself as inclusive of all races, communities and gender identifications, many such groups within the LGBT community have alleged that their events and communities and issues are increasingly marginalized in favour of a commercialized agenda. For example, many smaller community groups have indicated that they can no longer afford the increased fees required to place a marching contingent in the parade, which is increasingly dominated by corporate-sponsored advertising floats; and many LGBTQ-owned small businesses which historically depended on vendor booths at Pride Toronto for publicity have indicated that they can no longer afford the increased fees for inclusion in the vendor area.

As early as 2010 the Blackness Yes! committee, which organizes an annual dance party called Blockorama for LGBTQ people of colour, was raising the alarm that their program was being involuntarily forced to move from its traditional space, the Wellesley Stage across from Wellesley subway station, to unsuitable spaces such as the smaller parking lot in front of the Church Street Beer Store, the unpaved and unsuitable-for-dancing George Hislop Park, or the far too small Alexander Street Parkette. An appropriate space for Blockorama became one of the nine demands highlighted by Black Lives Matter in the 2016 incident discussed below.

In 2015, Pride Toronto was forced to withdraw applications to trademark the phrases &quot;Dyke March&quot; and &quot;Trans Pride&quot;, both referring to events which are organized by outside groups on Pride weekend as a &quot;reaction&quot; to lesbian and transgender people&#x27;s concerns that their issues and needs are not adequately addressed by Pride.

===Queers Against Israeli Apartheid===
In 2010 there was a controversy over Pride Toronto&#x27;s decisions regarding the participation of the group, Queers Against Israeli Apartheid (QuAIA). Initially, Pride Toronto agreed not to allow the phrase &quot;Israeli Apartheid&quot; as part of a deal with the City of Toronto (which had suggested that funding would be reviewed if the group was included). However, Pride Toronto subsequently reversed that decision June 23 (after it had received the funds from the city), allowing the group to participate. Several Pro-Israel groups also attended the event.

Pride Week&#x27;s decision to reverse the ban on QuAIA after it had received funding from the city (which was done on the condition that QuAIA not be allowed to participate) drew sharp criticism from several sources. Rob Ford, who was then a mayoral candidate (he was subsequently elected several months later), stated that: &quot;I want to express my disappointment and disgust with Pride Toronto&#x27;s decision to allow this hateful group to march.&quot; Giorgio Mammoliti, who was also running for mayor, announced that he would introduce a motion at the city council demanding that Pride return the $250,000 it had received from the city to reject all of Pride&#x27;s future funding requests. In an editorial, the &quot;National Post&quot; called for both the City of Toronto and corporate sponsors to halt all funding to Pride Week, arguing that: &quot;Anti-Israel bigots are free to have their own parade – but not on the public dime. The City of Toronto, whose councilors already have explicitly denounced QuAIA’s “apartheid” propaganda, should prepare to cut funding. Corporate sponsors should do likewise.&quot;

In March 2011, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has said that he will not allow city funding for the 2011 Toronto Pride Parade if organizers allow QuAIA march again this year. “Taxpayers dollars should not go toward funding hate speech,” Ford said. However, on April 13, 2011, the non-partisan Toronto city manager released a report for the city council&#x27;s executive committee concluding that &quot;the participation of QUAIA in the Pride Parade based solely on the phrase &#x27;Israeli Apartheid&#x27; does not violate the City’s Anti-Discrimination Policy. The City also cannot therefore conclude that the use of term on signs or banners to identify QuAIA constitutes the promotion of hatred or seeks to incite discrimination contrary to the Code.&quot; Ford indicated that he plans to defund the parade regardless of the City Manager report. On April 15, 2011, QuAIA announced that it would withdraw from the 2011 Pride parade; however, councillor Giorgio Mammoliti responded that he would still introduce a motion to withdraw city funding from Pride Toronto if the committee did not explicitly ban the group from participating.

In June 2012, the Toronto city council voted to condemn the phrase &quot;Israeli apartheid,&quot; as part of a resolution recognizing the Pride parade as a “significant cultural event that strongly promotes the ideals of tolerance and diversity.” The resolution said it slams the term &quot;Israeli apartheid&quot; for undermining the values of Pride and diminishing “the suffering experienced by individuals during the apartheid regime in South Africa.”

===Black Lives Matter===
At the 2016 parade, the Toronto chapter of Black Lives Matter, who had been selected by Pride as the honoured group, interrupted the parade for approximately half an hour to call attention to a number of demands addressing racism in the LGBTQ community. The demands included Pride providing stable funding and space to events for LGBTQ people of colour such as Blockorama, Black Queer Youth and the South Asian stage, which had seen funding cuts and repeated relocation to less convenient or suitable venues in recent years, as well as increasing diversity in the hiring of the organization&#x27;s staff and board — however, media coverage focused primarily on one explosive demand: that Toronto Police officers be barred from participating in Pride while in uniform, in response to ongoing police harassment of people of colour and transgender people.

Executive director Mathieu Chantelois signed BLM&#x27;s statement of demand, but later asserted that he had signed it only to end the sit-in and get the parade moving, and had not agreed to honour the demands. Following criticism of his handling of the incident, he resigned as executive director of Pride approximately six weeks later on August 11.

Debate over the action focused primarily on the question of whether banning uniformed police from the parade represented an abdication of the organization&#x27;s stated values of diversity and inclusivity, largely without regard to the matter of whether not honouring the demand, thereby alienating racialized and transgender members of the community, would also be an abdication of those same values. Some media analysts claimed that BLM was an outside group with no connection to LGBTQ issues at all, and thus should not have been invited to participate in the first place, even though all of the demands related directly to Pride&#x27;s handling of transgender and racial issues, and BLM leaders Janaya Khan and Syrus Marcus Ware are both queer-identified. Pride staff have reaffirmed on more than one occasion that police were not barred from participating in the parade at all, but were simply being directed not to march in uniform.

At Pride&#x27;s general meeting in January 2017, the organization&#x27;s members voted to affirm the motion that police not be permitted to march in uniform. Some opponents of the motion have falsely claimed that the meeting, and the resulting discussion about the police motion, were conducted in secret even though the meeting was scheduled and advertised normally and widely publicized by the media.

Following the meeting, Toronto Police chief Mark Saunders announced that the organization would voluntarily withdraw from any attempt to challenge the Pride membership&#x27;s vote or participate in the parade. He affirmed, however, that the police service would continue to hold its established annual Pride reception, and would raise the rainbow flag at Toronto Police Headquarters.

The decision led Toronto City Council to debate withdrawing its Pride funding for 2017. The motion to withdraw funding, put forward by councillor John Campbell, failed on a vote of 27-17. A small group of Toronto residents organized a competing event with the theme of &quot;first responder unity&quot;, which was scheduled for the same time as the main Pride parade but was located in another part of downtown Toronto. The First Responder Unity event made unauthorized use of Pride&#x27;s logo on its website, as well as making deceptive marketing claims in an apparent attempt to portray itself as the &quot;real&quot; Pride event, calling itself one of the world&#x27;s largest LGBTQ events and claiming a million attendees — Pride&#x27;s usual attendance figures — months before the Unity event&#x27;s actual attendance figures could possibly even be predicted. On June 19, however, Saunders publicly indicated that Toronto Police officers who wished to attend that event were also not permitted to do so in uniform.

In October 2018, Pride Toronto made the announcement that Toronto Police have been granted permission to march in the 2019 Pride parade. However, three months later Pride Toronto members reversed that position when they voted 163-161 to not allow uniformed officers in the 2019 parade.

===Departure of Olivia Nuamah===
In January 2020, Pride Toronto announced that Olivia Nuamah was no longer its executive director, as of January 15. Despite concerns from the organization&#x27;s membership about the timing of her departure just months before the 2020 event, the board declined to clarify the reasons for her departure or even whether she had resigned or had been fired.

=== Federal grant repayment ===
In 2024, it was reported that Pride Toronto would be repaying just over $505,000 in federal grant funding after the accounting firm KPMG found that the organization could not prove that it completed several projects despite receiving $1.85 million from the federal government.

==COVID-19 pandemic==
It was announced on March 31, 2020, that Toronto&#x27;s in-person Pride parade and festivities, originally scheduled for June 26 to 28, 2020, had been cancelled, as mandated by the City of Toronto&#x27;s prohibition on city-led mass events, parades and festivities until at least June 30, 2020, owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, although virtual Pride Month festivities and an online &quot;parade&quot; hosted by comedian Brandon Ash-Mohammed took place in June on the Pride Toronto website.

It was announced on February 24, 2021, that given the ban on city-led and permitted events had been extended through to June 30, 2021, the in-person Pride parade and other Pride-related festivities originally scheduled for June 25 to 27, 2021, would be cancelled. The event was again staged virtually and was hosted by &quot;Canada&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; season 1 winner Priyanka, with performers including Allie X, iskwē and Gary Beals. Despite the lack of an official Pride celebration, some small-scale Pride events did take place, including a Dyke March and a No Pride in Policing rally.

Toronto&#x27;s Pride parade and festivities resumed in June 2022.

==Financial difficulties==

===2009===
On June 15, 2009, before the 2009 Pride Week festival, it was announced through the office of then Minister of State Diane Ablonczy that Pride Toronto would receive a $400,000 federal grant under the Marquee Tourism program. Shortly after this announcement, Charles McVety&#x27;s Institute for Canadian Values issued a public statement titled &quot;Conservatives Announce New Program to Fund Sex Parades,&quot; which condemned Stephen Harper&#x27;s Conservative government for granting Pride Toronto the award and conflated the festival with sex abuse against children. It was later revealed that the Conservative government stripped Ablonczy of responsibility for the Marquee Tourism program within days of the announced funding for Pride Week, with the Institute for Canadian Values statement and the ensuing uproar reportedly playing a role. Conservative MP Brad Trost was quoted as saying, &quot;The pro-life and pro-family community should know and understand that the tourism funding money that went to the gay pride parade in Toronto was not government policy.&quot;

===May 2010===
In May 2010 it was revealed that Pride Toronto would not receive further federal funding under the Marquee Tourism program, despite having received a favorable review for its grant application. Toronto City Councilor Kyle Rae commented on the announcement, saying &quot;Reading the political tea leaves from last year, and Diane Ablonczy being shoved aside, I think all of us saw that this was going to happen.&quot;

===July 2010===
In the late summer of 2010 it was reported that Pride Toronto was facing severe financial difficulties because of the withdrawal of future funding from corporations and the City of Toronto due to the decision to allow QuAIA(Queers Against Israel Apartheid) to participate in the parade. Pride Toronto executive director Tracey Sandilands stated in an interview that &quot;the fact that we might not be able to count on city funding next year, and existing sponsors who have given us notice in writing to say that unless we resolve the issues to their satisfaction, they will no longer be sponsoring us next year. So next year looks very bleak at this point.”

Audited financial statements released on January 25, 2011, indicated that Pride week had a $431,808 operating deficit for 2009/2010 (ending July 31, 2010), up from $138,605 in 2008/2009. Pride Week&#x27;s bank indebtedness had increased significantly, from a surplus of $219,296 in 2009 to a deficit of $155,232 in 2010. In the 2009/2010 financial year, sponsorships, which were identified as the primary source of financial difficulties, increased by 17% over 2009 (from $1,225,044 to $1,469,027). However, the total value of the grants Pride Week received declined from $971,800 in 2009 to $709,025 in 2010.

==Awards==
The Pride Week event received the Top Choice Award for Top Event of the year 2007/2008.

== Programs and stages ==
Pride Toronto hosts multiple programs and stages, including several which occur every year. These include:

* Blockorama
* Fruit Loopz
* Dirty Disco
* Alterna Queer
* brOWN//out
* Yalla Barra

== Blockorama ==
First introduced to Toronto Pride festivities in 1999 by organizers of the Blackness Yes! Committee, Blockorama is an annual event created by and for BIPOC queers. Influenced by the history and politics that have shaped black and Caribbean Canadian communities, the organizers of Blockorama were concerned by the lack of safe BIPOC spaces at Toronto Pride. The event was created as a way for the queer black community to connect, but has grown over the years to include all BIPOC queers who might feel left out of the more dominant Pride events.

Between 2007 and 2010, Blockorama, the only black queer diasporic event at Pride Toronto, was moved three separate times, with each location being further from the main Pride festivities than the last. Although Blockorama has been returned to its original location at the Wellesley stage, this happened as a result of community push-back from Blackness Yes! and Black Lives Matter Toronto to the uprooting and displacement of the event.

==Third-party events==

Like many successful Pride events worldwide, the official events are supplemented with non-official events, including the Prism Festival, now in its seventh year and featuring international DJs and all-night dance parties. The Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada formerly presented its annual Dayne Ogilvie Prize, a literary award for LGBT writers, during Pride Month, although it later diversified to hold its gala at locations throughout Canada, and is now presented as part of the Writers&#x27; Trust&#x27;s regular slate of literary awards in October.

<doc id="446965" wikidata="Q690749" url="?curid=446965" title="Vibhuti">
<text>In Hinduism, vibhuti (), also called bhasmam or tirunīru, is sacred ash made of burnt dried wood, burnt cow dung and/or cremated bodies used in Agamic rituals. Devotees of Shiva apply &quot;vibhuti&quot; traditionally as three horizontal lines across the forehead (also known as &quot;tripundra)&quot; and other parts of the body.

According to the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;, the particles of ash which cling to the skin when &quot;tripundra&quot; is applied are to be considered to be individual lingams. The scriptures further state that &quot;bhasma&quot; purifies the soul and elevates the devotee of Shiva, and that works done without wearing &quot;bhasma&quot; are fruitless. There are various methods for the application of the ashes, according to the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;, and various mantras to be recited during application.

==Other uses==

Another meaning of &quot;vibhuti&quot; is a &#x27;glorious form&#x27;, in contrast with avatar, a reincarnation of Brahman.

In the third chapter of the Yoga Sutras, which is called &quot;vibhuti-pada&quot; (chapter on mystical powers), the focus is on &quot;vibhutis&quot; (&quot;siddhis&quot;), which are understood as mystical powers attained through samyama, a concentrated application of the last three limbs of yoga (&quot;dharana&quot;, &quot;dhyana&quot;, and &quot;samadhi&quot;).

Vaishnava theology describes a &quot;vibhuti&quot; as &#x27;incarnation of power&#x27;, a temporary occasional manifestation such as when holy men are infused with divine virtues and qualities are infused.

Sri Aurobindo mentions a &quot;vibhuti&quot; as &quot;the hero of a race&#x27;s struggle towards divine achievement, the hero in the Carlylean sense of heroism, a power of God in man.&quot;

== Manufacture ==
Whether at home, at a festival or commercially, it is expected that suitable prayers or mantras or other ritual practices will take place at appropriate times. Some people who produce vibhuti may prefer or insist that the various stages occur at certain times, such as the raw materials being collected on an auspicious day and the burning to occur during a festival celebration such as on Shivaratri.

While adulteration of vibhuti is frowned upon, fragrances in the form of herbs or other perfumes may be added either before burning in the form of herbs or mixed into the powder after burning.

=== Dung-based vibhuti ===
Fresh cow dung, preferably from varieties of cow seen historically in India and not European varieties like Jersey or Friesian, is collected and formed into cakes, balls, or sheets. The size and shape depends upon how the dung will arranged for burning but a tennis ball size is common. Over a period of around a week the dung is dried in sunlight while resting on a cloth or stone that keeps it from coming into contact with the ground.

The dried dung is then arranged in layers, alternating dung with a thin layer of paddy (rice hull that has not been processed to extract the grain, or even the whole plant except roots) or rice husks, and hay. This may occur in a fire pit or free standing such as a long triangular pile. The purpose of the plants is to provide heat while also preventing the dung itself from burning vigorously. Vibhuti prepared in fire pits may be covered to restrict oxygen. Over a period of several days the fire results in the dung being reduced to a dark or, ideally, a pale grey or a white coloured ash. The balls of dung ash are then gathered and ground by hand or machine.

The ground ash may be washed in water with the slurry and collected in a filter cloth. The wet ash paste is dried by fire or sunlight; particularly if the ash is dark it is dried in fire to lighten it. This washed and dried vibhuti is then powdered again 

Home production is similar to the process described above albeit on a smaller scale and the dung may be roasted in a metal vessel. During religious festivals the stack of materials may be ignited with fire from a homa.

=== Wood- or plant-based ===
Ashes made from various plants ascribed with spiritual or religious significance may be used. The plant itself is often burnt in a homa. Using certain types of plant may be indicated or contraindicated depending upon the user&#x27;s astrological chart.

<text>Multiple referral is the process through which a bill is referred to a second committee after the first is finished acting.

In the United States House of Representatives, proposed legislation can be sent to more than one Congressional committee due to a 1975 rules change. Reasons for referring legislation to more than one committee can include: a change in the most important issues; complexity of the legislation; or problems fitting the bill into the jurisdiction of only one committee.

However, as a result of a January 1995 change of the House rules, legislation may not be sent to multiple committees simultaneously. Under those same rules, the Speaker of the House must designate one or more primary committees in a joint referral.

In a split referral, legislation is divided into sections, with each part sent to the appropriate committee.

In a sequential referral, legislation is first sent to one committee, then to the next.

In the Senate, multiple referral can occur when jointly motioned by the leaders of both parties (almost never), or when the Senate grants unanimous consent.

<text>Baron Holland, of Holland in the County of Lincoln, and Baron Holland of Foxley, of Foxley in the County of Wiltshire, were two titles in the Peerage of Great Britain. The first barony was created on 7 March 1762 for Lady Caroline Fox, the daughter of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond and the eldest of the famous Lennox sisters. The second barony was created on 17 April 1763 for her husband, the prominent Whig politician Henry Fox. Lord and Lady Holland were both succeeded by their eldest son, the second Baron. He had previously represented Salisbury in Parliament. On his early death in 1774 the titles passed to his only son, the third Baron. He was also an influential Whig politician and notably served as Lord Privy Seal from 1806 to 1807 in the Ministry of All the Talents. He was succeeded by his eldest legitimate son, the fourth Baron. He sat as Member of Parliament for Horsham. He had four daughters but no sons and on his death in 1859 the titles became extinct.

The politician Charles James Fox was the second son of the first Baron and Baroness. The first Baron Holland of Foxley was the second and youngest son from the second marriage of the politician Sir Stephen Fox, and the younger brother of Stephen Fox-Strangways, 1st Earl of Ilchester, whose title was created with remainder to Henry Fox failing any heirs male of his body. Charles Richard Fox was the illegitimate son of the third Baron by his mistress and future wife, Lady Webster.

<text>Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX or Explorer 83 or SMEX-7) was a NASA orbiting space telescope designed to observe the universe in ultraviolet wavelengths to measure the history of star formation in the universe. In addition to paving the way for future ultraviolet missions, the space telescope allowed astronomers to uncover mysteries about the early universe and how it evolved, as well as better characterize phenomena like black holes and dark matter. The mission was extended three times over a period of 10 years before it was decommissioned in June 2013. GALEX was launched on 28 April 2003 and decommissioned in June 2013.

== Spacecraft ==
The spacecraft was three-axis stabilized, with power coming from four fixed solar panels. The satellite bus is from Orbital Sciences Corporation based on OrbView 4. The telescope was a Modified Ritchey–Chrétien with a rotating grism. GALEX used the first ever UV light dichroic beam-splitter flown in space to direct photons to the Near UV (175–280 nanometers) and Far UV (135–174 nanometers) microchannel plate detectors. Each of the two detectors has a diameter. The target orbit is circular and inclined at 29.00° to the equator.

== Launch ==
An air launched Pegasus launch vehicle, launched on 28 April 2003 at 11:59:57 UTC, placed the craft into a nearly circular orbit at an altitude of and an orbital inclination to the Earth&#x27;s equator of 29.00°.

== Mission ==
The Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) which explored the origin and evolution of galaxies, and the origins of stars and heavy elements over the redshift range of Z between 0 and 2. GALEX conducted an all-sky imaging survey, a deep imaging survey, and a survey of 200 galaxies nearest to the Milky Way galaxy. As well, GALEX performed three spectroscopic surveys over the 135–300 nanometre band. GALEX had a planned 29-month mission, and is a part of the Small Explorer (SMEX) program.

The first observation was dedicated to the crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia, and was images in the constellation of Hercules taken on 21 May 2003. This region was selected because it had been directly overhead the shuttle at the time of its last contact with the NASA Mission Control Center, Houston, Texas.

After its primary mission of 29 months, observation operations were extended. In 2009, one of its detectors, which observed in far-ultraviolet light, stopped functioning. Late in the mission, observations of more intense UV sources were allowed, including the Kepler field.

Observation operations were extended to almost 9 years, with NASA placing it into standby mode on 7 February 2012. NASA cut off financial support for operations of GALEX in early February 2011 as it was ranked lower than other projects which were seeking a limited supply of funding. The mission&#x27;s life-cycle cost to NASA was US$150.6 million. The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) negotiated to transfer control of GALEX and its associated ground control equipment to the California Institute of Technology in keeping with the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act. Under this Act, excess research equipment owned by the U.S. government can be transferred to educational institutions and non-profit organizations. On 17 May 2012, GALEX operations were transferred to Caltech.

On 28 June 2013, NASA decommissioned GALEX. It is expected that the spacecraft will remain in orbit until at least 2068 before it will re-enter the atmosphere.

== Science mission ==
The telescope made observations in ultraviolet wavelengths to measure the history of star formation in the universe 80% of the way back to the Big Bang. Since scientists have evidence that the Universe to be about 13.8 billion years old, the mission studied galaxies and stars across about 10 billion years of cosmic history.

The spacecraft&#x27;s mission was to observe hundreds of thousands of galaxies, with the goal of determining the distance of each galaxy from Earth and the rate of star formation in each galaxy. Near-UV (NUV) and Far-UV (FUV) emissions as measured by GALEX can indicate the presence of young stars, but may also originate from old stellar populations (e.g. sdB stars).

Partnering with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) on the mission were the California Institute of Technology, Orbital Sciences Corporation, University of California, Berkeley, Yonsei University, Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, and Laboratoire d&#x27;Astrophysique de Marseille, France.

The observatory participated in GOALS with Spitzer Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory, and Hubble Space Telescope. GOALS stands for &quot;Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey&quot;, and Luminous Infrared Galaxies were studied at the multiple wavelengths allowed by the telescopes.

== Science objectives ==
The primary objective of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer was to learn what factors trigger star formation inside galaxies; how quickly stars form, evolve and die; and how heavy chemical elements form in stars. Additional goals include:

* Determining how fast stars are forming inside each galaxy
* Determining when and how the stars we see today formed
* Creating the first map of the ultraviolet universe
* Helping scientists find and understand ultraviolet bright quasars. These objects can serve as background sources for the Hubble Space Telescope and FUSE as it probes the gases from which galaxies form stars

To accomplish its objectives, the Galaxy Evolution Explorer conducted eight surveys, grouped into two broad categories – a local universe investigation and a star formation history investigation. The local universe investigation includes the following four surveys:

* All-sky imaging survey – will look at the entire sky and develop a comprehensive catalogue of ultraviolet galaxy images, useful to map the distribution of star formation within the local universe
* Nearby galaxy survey – will study about 150 nearby galaxies that are familiar to scientists to understand how stars formed in individual galaxies
* Wide-field spectroscopic survey – will analyze the light wavelengths of galaxies in a wide swath of the sky
* Medium spectroscopic survey – will examine the light properties of galaxies within a narrower portion of the sky

The star formation history investigation will take information gathered by the local universe investigation and apply it to more distant galaxies by looking further back in time. It includes the following four surveys:

* Deep imaging survey – will look at a portion of the sky to study the distribution of star formation in the deep universe
* Deep spectroscopic survey – will look for the most distant galaxies
* Ultra-deep imaging survey – will look as deep as possible at a very small portion of the sky
* Medium imaging survey – will study star formation in galaxies beyond our local cosmic neighborhood, but not as deep as the deep imaging survey

== Telescope specifications ==
The telescope had a diameter aperture primary, in a Ritchey–Chrétien telescope f/6.0 configuration. It can see light wavelengths from 135 nanometres to 280-nm, with a field of view of 1.2° wide (larger than a full Moon). It had gallium arsenide (GaAs) solar cells which supply nearly 300 watts to the spacecraft.

== Experiment ==
=== Ultraviolet telescope ===
GALEX carries a single f/6.0, Ritchey–Chrétien telescope, with a diameter primary, and a secondary mirror. Beam-splitters direct the Near UV (NUV) and Far UV (FUV) components to separate photoelectric detectors of diameter . In each, the photoelectrons are multiplied by a microchannel plate, and detected by the anode grid. The grid enables determination of the exact position of electron impact, by the time delay of each pulse at the two ends. The telescope has a field of view (FoV) of 1.2°, and a resolution of five arcseconds, and enables either imaging or spectral composition of a single star/galaxy, by a rotatable wheel containing a clear window and a grism (a cross between a grating and a prism).

<doc id="446984" wikidata="Q5634619" url="?curid=446984" title="HMS Theseus (1892)">
<text>HMS &quot;Theseus&quot; was an protected cruiser of the Royal Navy. The &quot;Edgar&quot;s were similar but smaller versions of the . &quot;Theseus&quot; was launched at Leamouth, London in 1892 and commissioned on 14 January 1896.

==Service history==

Upon commission in 1896, &quot;Theseus&quot; was part of the Special Flying Squadron, which had been formed in response to a war scare with Germany, following which she was posted to the Mediterranean Fleet.

In January 1897 &quot;Theseus&quot; was ordered from the Mediterranean to join Rear Admiral Sir Harry Rawson&#x27;s fleet that had been sent to West Africa for a punitive expedition against Benin. The force was assembled off the coast of Benin by 3 February, with landings taking place on 9 February. Benin City was captured on 18 February and the force re-embarked on the ships of the fleet on 27 February. The ship&#x27;s crew suffered badly from Malaria as a result of her service during the Benin expedition, and when &quot;Theseus&quot; was refitted at Chatham later that year she required a thorough disinfection.

She served in the Mediterranean until late April 1902, when she left Malta homebound to pay off, arriving at Plymouth on 6 May, and Chatham three days later. She was paid off into the Medway Fleet Reserve on 28 May 1902.

She was a tender ship to from 1905 to 1913. In February 1913, &quot;Theseus&quot; joined the Queenstown Training Squadron.

When war broke out in 1914, &quot;Theseus&quot; joined the 10th Cruiser Squadron. In late August Russian forces in the Baltic captured copies of the German Navy codebook and &quot;Theseus&quot; was dispatched from Scapa Flow to Alexandrovosk in order to collect the copies offered to the British. Although she arrived on 7 September, due to mixups she did not depart until 30 September and returned to Scapa with two Russian couriers and the documents on 10 October. The books were formally handed over to the First Lord, Winston Churchill, on 13 October, and subsequently exploited by the cryptanalysts of Room 40.

&quot;Theseus&quot; rejoined 10th Cruiser Squadron, which on 15 October was on patrol off Aberdeen, deployed in line abreast at intervals of about . &quot;Theseus&quot; was unsuccessfully attacked by the German submarine . The flotilla was ordered to proceed at full speed to the northwest in response to this attack, but no response to the order was heard from &quot;Theseus&quot;″s sister ship . &quot;Hawke&quot; had been torpedoed by the German submarine several hours earlier and had quickly capsized and sank out of sight of the rest of the flotilla. Only 70 of &quot;Hawke&quot;″s 594 crew survived.

&quot;Theseus&quot; was rearmed, along with bulges to her hull, which were added to enable her to take part in the Dardanelles Campaign. In 1916 she was deployed to the Mediterranean and was then sent to the White Sea. In 1918 she was sent to the Aegean Sea to become a depot ship. In 1919, &quot;Theseus&quot; had her final deployment, when she was sent to the Black Sea. She returned to the UK in 1920 and was scrapped the following year in Germany.

<doc id="446990" wikidata="Q148270" url="?curid=446990" title="Leonardo's robot">
<text>Leonardo&#x27;s robot, or Leonardo&#x27;s mechanical knight (Italian: &quot;Automa cavaliere&quot;, lit. &quot;Automaton knight&quot;), is a humanoid automaton designed and possibly constructed by Leonardo da Vinci in the late 15th century. 

The robot’s design largely consists of a series of pulleys that allow it to mimic human motions. Operational versions of the robot have been reconstructed by multiple researchers after the discovery of Leonardo’s sketches in the 1950s. Leonardo’s designs may have served as inspirations for robotics projects backed by NASA and Intuitive Surgical.

== History ==
Leonardo possibly started sketching ideas for his robot before he began work on The Last Supper. Though no complete drawings of the automaton survived, Leonardo’s notes suggest he may have constructed a prototype around 1495, while he was under the patronage of Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan.

Leonardo’s initial studies in anatomy and kinesiology, as recorded in his Codex Huygens, may have informed his desire to design an automated device. The principles of his humanoid robot can be found among a set of folios composed of anatomical sketches that are believed to follow his Vitruvian Canon of Proportions.

Leonardo’s interest in engineering may have also inspired him to create his automaton, which appears in the form of a mechanical knight. Before Leonardo designed his mechanical knight, eyewitness accounts detail how he created a mechanical lion that could move independently of human intervention. The mechanical lion was displayed in many public venues including the wedding of Maria de Medici and at the arrival of the French King Francis I in Lyon in 1515.
== Design ==
Leonardo’s robot is largely controlled by a system of pulleys composed of a central driver, individual drivers, and supporting idler pulleys. The inside of the robot&#x27;s chest contains a mechanical controller for the arms. This controller triggers the worm gears connected to the robot’s pulley system, enabling the robot to wave its arms. The robot’s legs are controlled with an external crank and cable system attached to key pivots on the ankles, knees, and hips. The robot’s inner mechanisms are hidden behind a German-Italian suit of medieval armor.

The robot’s head has a hinged jaw and is attached to a flexible neck. The robot’s body can sit upright and move its arms around in various directions. The robot&#x27;s lower body operates with three degrees of freedom while the arms utilize a four-degree-of-freedom system, possibly so the robot can perform whole-arm grasping.

Drums located inside of the robot produce sounds as the rest of the body moves. Like many other mechanical forms of palatial entertainment at the time, the robot may have been designed to scare audiences.

== Modern reconstructions ==
Around the 1950s, researcher Carlo Pedretti discovered sketchbooks containing Leonardo’s notes on the mechanical knight, with numerous fragmented sketches and design details scattered across various pages.

After meeting Pedretti in 1993, roboticist Mark Rosheim collaborated with him to piece together the fragmented sketches and develop a CAD reconstruction of the robot.

In 2002, the BBC filmed Rosheim reconstructing Leonardo’s robot. Rosheim combined his own designs with Leonardo’s preliminary sketches for his reconstruction. He also used a photo of Renaissance armor to plan the exterior of the robot and ensure that all of the robot’s fragments aligned. To account for the compressed filming schedule of two weeks, Rosheim simplified the design and used a stock suit of armor.

In 2007, Mario Taddei, technical director and researcher at the Leonardo3 (L3) research center and museum in Milan, also reconstructed Leonardo’s robot. Both Taddei and Rosheim’s reconstructions were operational.

== Legacy ==
NASA commissioned Mark Rosheim to design an advanced humanoid robot called Surrogate and nicknamed &quot;Surge”. Rosheim drew inspiration from Leonardo’s robotic designs, integrating principles from Leonardo&#x27;s exploration of human-like movement and mechanical function into Surge&#x27;s design.

Intuitive Surgical launched the first da Vinci Surgical System in 2000. It is believed that the robotic-assisted surgical system was named after Leonardo da Vinci as an homage to his contributions to the fields of human anatomy, mechanics, and automation. Some also argue that the name of the surgical system commemorates how Leonardo’s robot appears to be the first human automaton to prove that the mechanisms in human bodies could be replicated using machinery.

<doc id="446994" wikidata="Q7649236" url="?curid=446994" title="Suspension of the rules in the United States Congress">
<text>Suspension of the rules in the United States Congress is the specific set of procedures within the United States Congress that allows for the general parliamentary procedure of how and when to suspend the rules.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

===Overview===
In the United States House of Representatives, suspension of the rules is a procedure generally used to quickly pass bills which enjoy broad, bipartisan support. 

A member can make a motion to suspend the rules only if the Speaker of the House allows them to. Once a member moves to &quot;suspend the rules&quot; and take some action, debate is limited to 40 minutes, no amendments can be offered to the motion or the underlying matter, and a 2/3 majority of Members present and voting is required to agree to the motion.

Under the rules of the 119th Congress, motions for suspension of the rules are currently allowed only on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, as they used to be prior to the 116th Congress. In the 117th and 118th Congress, a motion to suspend the rules could be made on any day.

A suspension motion sets aside all procedural and other rules that otherwise prohibit the House from considering the measure—but the motion never mentions the specific rules that are suspended. Typically, a suspension motion is phrased as a motion to &quot;...suspend the rules and pass the bill&quot; and, if the motion is agreed to, the bill is considered passed by the House. This means that, most of the time, a suspension motion is effectively a motion to pass a bill immediately notwithstanding any rule preventing such immediate passage. A member can also move to suspend the rules and take another action, such as to &quot;suspend the rules and consider the bill,&quot; and the House shall take the proposed action if two-thirds of those voting are in favor of the motion.

Most often, bills &quot;on suspension&quot; are non-controversial legislation—such as naming Post Offices of the United States Postal Service or federal buildings. However, in the 118th Congress, suspension of the rules was often used in order to pass spending bills and continuing resolutions. Since those bills were negotiated between the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-controlled Senate, they were generally supported by many members from both parties (allowing them to clear the two-thirds treshold required for suspension of the rules), although they were repeatedly opposed by dozens of fiscally conservative Republicans.

===Suspension calendar===
These votes, under the rules, may only take place on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. Under special circumstances, suspension votes may take place on Thursdays or Fridays, or other days, but that happens rarely and requires a separate vote of the House as to whether that should occur.

The 2007 U.S. Farm Bill was considered using such a procedure. Due to a procedural glitch, the bill was improperly sent to the President and in an unusual attempt to solve the problem, the House passed it again as . Hence the House Leadership used the suspension calendar to do so.

Other examples of suspension bills in the 110th United States Congress:

* – Recognizing the necessity for the United States to maintain its significant leadership role in improving the health and promoting the resiliency of coral reef ecosystems, and for other purposes (Rep. Bordallo – Natural Resources)
* – A joint resolution directing the United States to initiate international discussions and take necessary steps with other Nations to negotiate an agreement for managing migratory and transboundary fish stocks in the Arctic Ocean (Sen. Stevens (AK) – Natural Resources)
* – Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Mackinac Island State Park Commission&#x27;s Historical Preservation and Museum Program, which began on June 15, 1958 (Rep. Stupak – Natural Resources)
* – Honoring the 60th anniversary of the commencement of the carving of the Crazy Horse Memorial (Rep. Herseth Sandlin – Natural Resources)
* – To assist in the conservation of rare felids and rare canids by supporting and providing financial resources for the conservation programs of nations within the range of rare felid and rare canid populations and projects of persons with demonstrated expertise in the conservation of rare felid and rare canid populations (Rep. Udall (NM) – Natural Resources)

== U.S. Senate ==
In the United States Senate,
Rule XVI prohibits amendments that propose general legislation to appropriations legislations. To prevent a point of order from killing the amendment, a Senator may offer a motion to suspend rule XVI, paragraph 4, essentially making the order germane. This motion requires a 2/3 majority to approve, meaning that it rarely passes. It should not be confused with a motion to waive the Budget Act, which requires a 3/5 vote to pass and applies to amendments that spend in amounts that exceed the levels set out in the annual budget resolution, as well as many other financial issues.

<doc id="446998" wikidata="Q3306741" url="?curid=446998" title="Moussa Hojeij">
<text>Moussa Ali Hojeij (; born 6 August 1974) is a Lebanese football manager and former player.

Hojeij was the best player in the Al-Manar Football Festival several times, and was captain of the national team. He is also a match analyst for Lebanon national team matches on beIN Sports.

== Club career ==
Hojeij joined Nejmeh&#x27;s youth team on 26 February 1993. In 2000, Hojeij became the first captain to win the Lebanese Premier League title for Nejmeh after the civil war.

In 2006 he was released by Nejmeh after scoring a total of 75 league goals, and signed with Mabarra. In 2008 Hojeij signed for Lebanese Second Division club Khoyol, and in the summer of 2009 he signed with Shabab Sahel. Hojeij returned to Nejmeh in 2011, retiring in 2013.

== International career ==
Hojeij equalised in the 76th minute against Iraq at the 2000 AFC Asian Cup through a free kick, to bring the score to 2–2.

== Managerial career ==

=== Early career ===
Hojeij began his managerial career in 2012, as a player-coach for Nejmeh. He became head coach of Nabi Chit in 2014, who terminated his contract after matchday four. Hojeij was then appointed head coach of Racing Beirut in the second half of the season, saving them from relegation.

In the 2015–16 season, he took charge of Shabab Sahel, before returning to Racing the following season, with whom he won the Lebanese Challenge Cup.

=== Ahed ===
In 2017, Ahed appointed Hojeij as head coach; he most notably helped them beat Zamalek of Egypt in the 2017 Arab Club Championship, and winning the Lebanese Super Cup against Ansar. On 18 December 2017, Hojeij was appointed head coach of Tripoli for the second leg of the season, finishing in eighth place after six wins, seven draws and nine defeats.

=== Returns to Nejmeh ===
Hojeij returned as head coach of Nejmeh in 2018. On 29 June 2020, Hojeij was appointed manager of Nejmeh for the third time, after having coached them between 2011 and 2013, and in 2018.

He returned to the helm of Nejmeh once again, in February 2022. After insulting the Lebanese Football Association (LFA) and its president, following a red card received by Nejmeh during a league match against Safa on 3 April, the LFA suspended Hojeij for one year, and fined him £L25 million. The LFA extended the suspension to two years on 11 April.

=== Safa and Tadamon Sour ===
On 9 January 2023, Hojeij was appointed head coach of Safa. He became coach of Tadamon Sour in 2024.

== Presidential career ==
On 10 June 2021, Hojeij announced his candidacy to become president of the Lebanese Football Association; the only other candidate was incumbent president Hashem Haidar. The elections took place on 29 June in Beirut, with Haidar winning by 40 votes to 4.

<doc id="447003" wikidata="Q1390986" url="?curid=447003" title="Helvidius Priscus">
<text>Helvidius Priscus, Stoic philosopher and statesman, lived during the reigns of Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius and Vespasian.

==Biography==

Helvidius came from town of Cluviae, and his father had been the senior centurion of a legion. According to Tacitus, from early youth he devoted his brilliant intellect to academic studies, not (as so often happens) in order to disguise ease and idleness under a pretentious name, but to arm himself more stoutly against the unpredictable fluctuations of fortune of a public career. As citizen, senator, husband, son-in-law and friend, he met the varied obligations of life in a consistent way, showing contempt for wealth, stubborn adherence to the right course of action and courage in the face of danger. Like his father-in-law, Thrasea Paetus, whose daughter Fannia he had taken as his second wife, Priscus was distinguished for his ardent and courageous republicanism. Although he repeatedly offended his rulers, he held several high offices. During Nero&#x27;s reign he was quaestor of Achaea and tribune of the plebs (AD 56); he restored peace and order in Armenia, and gained the respect and confidence of the provincials. His declared sympathy with Brutus and Cassius occasioned his banishment in 66.

Having been recalled to Rome by Galba in 68, he at once impeached Eprius Marcellus, the accuser of Thrasea Paetus, but dropped the charge, as the condemnation of Marcellus would have involved a number of senators. As praetor elect Priscus ventured to oppose Vitellius in the senate (Tacitus, &quot;Hist.&quot; ii. 91), and as praetor (70) he maintained, in opposition to Vespasian, that the management of the finances ought to be left to the discretion of the senate. He proposed that the Temple of Jupiter Best and Greatest, which had been destroyed towards the end of the Year of Four Emperors, should be restored at the public expense. Lastly, Priscus saluted Vespasian by his private name, and did not recognize him as emperor in his praetorian edicts.

At length he was banished a second time, and shortly afterwards was executed by Vespasian&#x27;s order. His life, in the form of a warm panegyric, written at his widow&#x27;s request by Herennius Senecio, caused its author&#x27;s death in the reign of Domitian.

== Family ==
Helvidius Priscus is known to have two children by Fannia: a son, Helvidius Priscus, later suffect consul, who was banished and likely executed by Domitian; and a daughter, Helvidia, who married Marcus Annius Herennius Pollio. He probably also had a granddaughter, Helvidia Priscilla, who married Lucius Vipstanus Poplicola Messalla. Through her, he has known descendants into at least the 6th century.

==Modern appearances==
* James Madison wrote under the pseudonym Helvidius in 1793, in response to Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s Pacificus columns on American neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars.
* The Helvidius Group of Columbia University, publisher of the &quot;Journal of Politics &amp; Society&quot;, takes its name from the statesman.

<text>The Free State (; ; ; ; ), formerly known as the Orange Free State, is a province of South Africa. Its capital is Bloemfontein, which is also South Africa&#x27;s judicial capital. Its historical origins lie in the Boer republic called the Orange Free State and later the Orange Free State Province.

==History==

The current borders of the province date from 1994 when the Bantustans were abolished and reincorporated into South Africa. It is also the only one of the four original provinces of South Africa not to undergo border changes, apart from the reincorporation of Bantustans, and its borders date from before the outbreak of the Boer War.

==Geography==

The Free State is situated on a succession of flat grassy plains sprinkled with pastureland, resting on a general elevation of 3,800 feet only broken by the occasional hill or kopje. The rich soil and pleasant climate allow for a thriving agricultural industry.

The province is high-lying, with almost all land being 1,000 metres above sea level. The Drakensberg and Maloti Mountains foothills raise the terrain to over 2,000 m in the east. The Free State lies in the heart of the Karoo Sequence of rocks, containing shales, mudstones, sandstones and the Drakensberg Basalt forming the youngest capping rocks. Mineral deposits are plentiful, with gold and diamonds being of particular importance, mostly found in the north and west of the province.

===Fauna and flora===
The flats in the south of the reserve provide ideal conditions for large herds of plain game such as black wildebeest and springbok. The ridges, koppies and plains typical of the northern section are home to kudu, red hartebeest, southern white rhinoceros and buffalo. The Southern African wildcat, black wildebeest, zebra, eland, white rhinoceros and wild dog can be seen at the Soetdoring Nature Reserve near Bloemfontein. The South African cheetahs were reintroduced in the Free State for the first time in June 2013 after a hundred years of regional extinction, at Laohu Valley Reserve near Philippolis. Following the reintroduction of an adult female South African cheetah in early 2016, three wild cheetah cubs were born for the first time in Laohu Valley Reserve in February 2017, making the three new cubs the first cheetahs born in the wild since their disappearance from the Free State province in over a century.

===Climate===
The Free State experiences a continental climate, characterised by warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters. Areas in the east experience frequent snowfalls, especially on the higher ranges, whilst the west can be extremely hot in summer. Almost all precipitation falls in the summer months as brief afternoon thunderstorms, with aridity increasing towards the west. Areas in the east around Harrismith, Bethlehem and Ficksburg are well watered. The capital, Bloemfontein, experiences hot, moist summers and cold, dry winters frequented by severe frost.
* Bloemfontein averages: January maximum: 31 °C (min: 15 °C), July maximum: 17 °C (min: -2 °C), annual precipitation: 559 mm
* Bethlehem averages: January maximum: 27 °C (min: 13 °C), July maximum: 16 °C (min: -2 °C), annual precipitation: 680 mm

===Borders===

In the southeast, the Free State borders seven districts of Lesotho:
*Mokhotlong – farthest to the east
*Butha-Buthe – northwest of Mokhotlong and northeast of Leribe
*Leribe – southwest of Butha-Buthe and northeast of Berea
*Berea – southwest of Leribe and north of Maseru
*Maseru – south of Berea and northeast of Mafeteng
*Mafeteng – southwest of Maseru and northwest of Mohale&#x27;s Hoek
*Mohale&#x27;s Hoek – southeast of Mafeteng
Domestically, it borders the following provinces:
*KwaZulu-Natal – east
*Eastern Cape – south
*Northern Cape – west
*North West – northwest
*Gauteng – north
*Mpumalanga – northeast
The Free State borders more districts of Lesotho and more provinces of South Africa than any other province.

It is traversed by the northwesterly line of equal latitude and longitude.

== Demographics ==
As of the 2022 census, the Free State had a population of 2,961,864, an increase of 8.0% from the prior census in 2011. It recorded the slowest population growth among South Africa&#x27;s nine provinces between 2011 and 2022. It is also the second-least populous and second-least densely populated province. The median age is 28, an increase of 3 years from 2011.

=== Race/Ethnicity ===
In the 2022 census, 88.9% of the population described themselves as Black African, 8.0% as White, 2.6% as Coloured, and 0.4% as Indian/Asian. The majority of the population are black Africans who speak Sotho as a first language. The vast majority of White people in the Free State are Afrikaners. 

The proportion of whites in the province has shrunk considerably since the nineteenth century. In 1880 the white population made up 45.7% of the total population. In 1904 this had fallen to 36.8%. Of the 142,679 people in 1904, only 60% were born in the province. Of the 2,726 European immigrants born in non-British states, 1,025 came from the Russian Empire, mainly Jews. In 1904 whites made up a majority in most settlements, namely Ficksburg (52.3%), Wepener (60.2%), Ladybrand (60.0%), and Kroonstad (51.6%), and made up a substantial minority in Bloemfontein (45.7%) and Winburg (36.3%).

=== Languages ===
In the 2022 census, 72.3% of the population reported their first language as Sotho, 10.3% as Afrikaans, 5.5% as Xhosa, 5.3% as Setswana, and 1.5% as English. The Free State is the only province in which native Sotho-speakers form a majority of the population. It is also the province with the third-highest proportion of Afrikaans speakers, after the Western Cape and the Northern Cape.

Sesotho is the dominant home language in most of the province. Zulu is the major language in the far eastern municipality of Phumelela. Setswana is the main language in Tokologo in the northwest, and in and around the area of Thaba Nchu. Afrikaans is widely spoken throughout the province, as a first language for the majority of whites and coloureds (who constitute a minority) and as a second or third language by Sesotho, Setswana and Xhosa speakers. Although there are relatively few native English speakers, English is becoming increasingly important as the language of business and government. This is evidenced by the shift of tertiary institutions such as the University of the Free State from solely using Afrikaans as the medium of instruction to using both Afrikaans and English, and eventually only English.

=== Religion ===
The population of the Free State is overwhelmingly Christian. As of the 2022 census, 92.7% of the population described themselves as Christians, the third-highest proportion among South Africa&#x27;s provinces. Among other religions, 4.9% of the population stated that they practiced Traditional African religions, and 0.5% of the population described themselves as Muslim. 1.4% of the population described themselves as being atheist, agnostic, or having no religious affiliation.

== Municipalities ==


The Free State Province is divided into one metropolitan municipality and four district municipalities. The district municipalities are in turn divided into 19 local municipalities:

===Metropolitan municipalities===

* Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality
===District municipalities===

* Fezile Dabi District
** Moqhaka
** Ngwathe
** Metsimaholo
** Mafube
* Thabo Mofutsanyana District

** Masilonyana
** Tokologo
** Tswelopele
** Matjhabeng
** Nala
* Xhariep District
** Letsemeng
** Kopanong
** Mohokare
=== Major cities and towns ===

The Free State&#x27;s major towns include:
* Bloemfontein &amp; Botshabelo in Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality
* Welkom, Odendaalsrus and Virginia in Lejweleputswa
* Bethlehem, Harrismith and Phuthaditjhaba in Thabo Mofutsanyana
* Kroonstad, Sasolburg and Parys in Fezile Dabi

== Government and Politics ==

=== Government ===
The Free State provincial government is based in Bloemfontein, the provincial capital. The Free State Division of the High Court of South Africa also sits in Bleomfontein.

Like South Africa&#x27;s other provinces, the Free State has a parliamentary system of government, with the provincial premier elected by the Free State Provincial Legislature. The premier then selects the members of the provincial Executive Council (cabinet). The current premier is Maqueen Letsoha-Mathae of the African National Congress (ANC), who has held the position since 2024.

The provincial legislature is elected every five years by a system of party-list proportional representation and meets at the Vierde Raadsaal in Bloemfontein.

=== Politics ===
The politics of the Free State has been dominated by the ANC since the end of Apartheid. The ANC has won a majority of the vote in every provincial election since 1994.

The most recent provincial election was held in 2024. The ANC again won the election, albeit with a sharply reduced majority. The Democratic Alliance (DA) retained its position as the province&#x27;s second largest party and official opposition, with a significant increase in its share of the vote. 

The results of the 2024 provincial election are as follows:

== Health ==

The Free State is the only province in South Africa that operates a free 24-hour dedicated rotor-wing aeromedical service from a public hospital. They are able to reach far-flung areas in only 45 minutes and deliver a high level of care on scene. On 31 October 2018, Free State Emergency Medical Service launched an additional 65 road ambulances to augment the fleet.

The Free State has many public and private hospitals.

==Economy==

The province is the granary of South Africa, with agriculture central to its economy, while mining on the rich goldfields reef is its largest employer.

===Agriculture===

Agriculture dominates the Free State landscape, with cultivated land covering 32,000 square kilometres, and natural veld and grazing a further 87,000 square kilometres of the province. It is also South Africa&#x27;s leader in the production of biofuels, or fuel from agricultural crops, with a number of ethanol plants under construction in the grain-producing western region. South Africa is one of the top ten Maize producers in the world (12,365,000 tons ).

Field crops yield almost two-thirds of the gross agricultural income of the province. Animal products contribute a further 30%, with the balance generated by horticulture. Ninety percent of the country&#x27;s cherry crop is produced in the Ficksburg district, which is also home to the country&#x27;s two largest asparagus canning factories. Soya, sorghum, sunflowers and wheat are cultivated in the eastern Free State, where farmers specialise in seed production. About 40% of the country&#x27;s potato yield comes from the province&#x27;s high-lying areas.

The main vegetable crop is asparagus, both white and green varieties. Although horticulture is expanding and becoming increasingly export-orientated, most produce leaves the province unprocessed.

The Free State&#x27;s advantage in floriculture is the opposing seasons of the southern and northern hemispheres.

===Mining===

The Free State is also rich in mineral wealth, gold representing 20% of the world&#x27;s total gold production. Mining is the province&#x27;s major employer. The province has 12 gold mines, producing 30% of South Africa&#x27;s output and making it the fifth-largest producer of gold in the world. The Harmony Gold Refinery and Rand Refinery are the only two gold refineries in South Africa.

Gold mines in the Free State also supply a substantial portion of the total silver produced in the country, while considerable concentrations of uranium occurring in the gold-bearing conglomerates of the goldfields are extracted as a byproduct.

Bituminous coal is also mined, and converted to petrochemicals at Sasolburg. The Free State also produces high-quality diamonds from its kimberlite pipes and fissures, and the country&#x27;s largest deposit of bentonite is found in the Koppies district.

===Industry===

Since 1989, the Free State economy has moved from dependence on primary sectors such as mining and agriculture to an economy increasingly oriented towards manufacturing and export. 
Some 14% of the province&#x27;s manufacturing is classified as being in high-technology industries – the highest of all provincial economies. The northern Free State&#x27;s chemicals sector is one of the most important in the southern hemisphere. Petrochemicals company Sasol, based in the town of Sasolburg, is a world leader in the production of fuels, waxes, chemicals and low-cost feedstock from coal.

===Tourism===

In the northeastern Free State, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Maluti mountains, the Golden Gate Highlands National Park is the province&#x27;s prime tourist attraction. The park gets its name from the brilliant shades of gold cast by the sun on the spectacular sandstone cliffs, especially the imposing Brandwag or Sentinel Rock, which keeps vigil over the park.

The sandstone of this region has been used for the lovely dressed-stone buildings found on the Eastern Highlands, while decoratively painted Sotho houses dot the grasslands. Some of South Africa&#x27;s most valued San (Bushman) rock art is found in the Free State, particularly in the regions around Clarens, Bethlehem, Ficksburg, Ladybrand and Wepener.

<text>The Northern Cape ( ; ; ) is the largest and most sparsely populated province of South Africa. It was created in 1994 when the Cape Province was split up. Its capital is Kimberley. It includes the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park, part of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park and an international park shared with Botswana. It also includes the Augrabies Falls and the diamond mining regions in Kimberley and Alexander Bay.

The Namaqualand region in the west is famous for its Namaqualand daisies. The southern towns of De Aar and Colesberg found within the Great Karoo are major transport nodes between Johannesburg, Cape Town and Gqeberha. Kuruman can be found in the north-east and is known as a mission station. It is also well known for its artesian spring and Eye of Kuruman. The Orange River flows through the province, forming the borders with the Free State in the southeast and with Namibia to the northwest. The river is also used to irrigate the many vineyards in the arid region near Upington.

Native speakers of Afrikaans comprise a higher percentage of the population in the Northern Cape than in any other province. The Northern Cape&#x27;s four official languages are Afrikaans, Tswana, Xhosa, and English. Minorities speak the other official languages of South Africa and a few people speak indigenous languages such as Nama and Khwe.

The provincial motto, &quot;Sa ǁa ǃaĩsi &#x27;uĩsi&quot; (&quot;We go to a better life&quot;), is in the Nǀu language of the Nǁnǂe (ǂKhomani) people. It was given in 1997 by one of the language&#x27;s last speakers, Ms. Elsie Vaalbooi of Rietfontein, who has since died. It was South Africa&#x27;s first officially registered motto in a Khoisan language. Subsequently, South Africa&#x27;s national motto, &quot;ǃKe e ǀxarra ǁke&quot;, was derived from the extinct ǀXam language.

== History ==

The Northern Cape was one of three provinces made out of the Cape Province in 1994, the others being Western Cape to the south and Eastern Cape to the southeast. Politically, it had been dominated since 1994 by the African National Congress (ANC). Ethnic issues are important in the politics of the Northern Cape. For example, it is the site of the Orania settlement, whose leaders have called for a Volkstaat for the Afrikaner people in the province.

The Northern Cape is also the home of over 1,000 San who emigrated from Namibia following the independence of the country; they had served as trackers and scouts for the South African Defence Force during the South African Border War, and feared reprisals from their former foes. They were awarded a settlement in Platfontein in 1999 by the Mandela government.

The precolonial history of the Northern Cape is reflected in a rich, mainly Stone Age, archaeological . Cave sites include Wonderwerk Cave near Kuruman, which has a uniquely long sequence stretching from the turn of the twentieth century at the surface to more than 1 million (and possibly nearly 2 million) years in its basal layer (where stone tools, occurring in very low density, may be Oldowan). Many sites across the province, mostly in open air locales or in sediments alongside rivers or pans, document Earlier, Middle and Later Stone Age habitation. From Later Stone Age times, mainly, there is a wealth of rock art sites – most of which are in the form of rock engravings such as at Wildebeest Kuil and many sites in the area known as ǀXam -ka !kau, in the Karoo. They occur on hilltops, slopes, rock outcrops and occasionally (as in the case of Driekops Eiland near Kimberley), in a river bed. In the north eastern part of the province there are sites attributable to the Iron Age such as Dithakong. Environmental factors have meant that the spread of Iron Age farming westwards (from the 17th century – but dating from the early first millennium AD in the eastern part of South Africa) was constrained mainly to the area east of the Langeberg Mountains, but with evidence of influence as far as the Upington area in the eighteenth century. From that period the archaeological record also reflects the development of a complex colonial frontier when precolonial social formations were considerably disrupted and there is an increasing &#x27;fabric heavy&#x27; imprint of built structures, ash-heaps, and so on. The copper mines of Namaqualand and the diamond rush to the Kimberley area resulted in industrial archaeological landscapes in those areas which herald the modern era in South African history.

== Geography ==
The Northern Cape is South Africa&#x27;s largest province, and distances between towns are enormous due to its sparse population. Its size is just shy of the size of the American state of Montana and slightly larger than that of Germany. The province is dominated by the Karoo Basin and consists mostly of sedimentary rocks and some dolerite intrusions. The south and south-east of the province is high-lying, , in the Roggeveld and Nuweveld districts. The west coast is dominated by the Namaqualand region, famous for its spring flowers. This area is hilly to mountainous and consists of granites and metamorphic rocks. The central areas are generally flat with interspersed salt pans. Kimberlite intrusions punctuate the Karoo rocks, giving the province its most precious natural resource, diamonds. The north is primarily Kalahari Desert, characterised by parallel red sand dunes and acacia tree dry savanna.

Northern Cape has a shoreline in the west on the South Atlantic Ocean. It borders the following areas of Namibia and Botswana:
*ǁKaras Region, Namibia – Northwest
*Hardap Region, Namibia – Far northwest
*Kgalagadi District, Botswana – North
Domestically, it borders the following provinces:
*North West – Northeast
*Free State – East
*Eastern Cape – Southeast
*Western Cape – South and southwest

=== Rivers ===
The major river system is the Orange (or Gariep) River Basin, draining the interior of South Africa westwards into the Atlantic Ocean. (The political philosopher Neville Alexander has used the idea of the &#x27;Garieb&#x27; as a metaphor for nationhood in South Africa, a flowing together, in preference to the rainbow metaphor where the diverse colours remain distinct).
The principal tributary of the Orange is the Vaal River, which flows through part of the Northern Cape from the vicinity of Warrenton. The Vaal, in turn, has tributaries within the province: the Harts River and the Riet River, which has its own major tributary, the Modder River.

Above the Orange-Vaal confluence, the Seekoei River drains part of the northeastern Karoo into the Orange River above the Vanderkloof Dam.
Next downstream from the Orange-Vaal confluence is the Brak River, which flows nonperennially from the south and is in turn fed by the Ongers River, rising in the vicinities of Hanover and Richmond respectively.
Along the Orange River near the town of Kakamas, the Hartebeest River drains the central Karoo. Above Kenhardt the Hartebeest is known as the Sak River, which has its source on the northern side of the escarpment, southeast of Williston.
Further downstream from Kakamas, below the Augrabies Falls, and seldom actually flowing into the Orange River, is the Molopo River, which comes down from the Kalahari in the north. With its tributary, the Nossob River, it defines part of the international boundary between South Africa and Botswana. Further tributaries of the Molopo River include the Kuruman River, fed by the Moshaweng River and Kgokgole River, and the Matlhwaring River.
Flowing west into the Atlantic, in Namaqualand, is the Buffels River and, further south, the Groen River. 

=== Climate ===

Mostly arid to semiarid, few areas in the province receive more than of rainfall per annum and the average annual rainfall over the province is . Rainfall generally increases from west to east from a minimum average of to a maximum of per year. The west experiences most rainfall in winter, while the east receives most of its moisture from late summer thunderstorms. Many areas experience extreme heat, with the hottest temperatures in South Africa measured along the Namibian border. Summers maximums are generally or higher, sometimes higher than . Winters are usually frosty and clear, with southern areas sometimes becoming bitterly cold, such as Sutherland, which often receives snow and temperatures occasionally drop below the mark.

* Kimberley averages: January maximum: (min: ), June maximum: (min: ), annual precipitation: 
* Springbok averages: January maximum: (min: ), July maximum: (min: ), annual precipitation: 
* Sutherland averages: January maximum: (min: ), July maximum: (min: ), annual precipitation: 

== Demographics ==
As of the 2022 census, the Northern Cape had a population of 1,355,629, an increase of 18.3% from the prior census in 2011. It is least populous and by a considerable margin the least densely populated of South Africa&#x27;s nine provinces. The median age is 27, an increase of 2 years from 2011.

=== Race/Ethnicity ===
In the 2022 census, 50.1% of the population described themselves as Black African, 41.6% as Coloured, 7.3% as White and 0.8% as Indian/Asian. Coloureds form a higher proportion of the population in the Northern Cape than in any other province except for the Western Cape. 
=== Languages ===
In the 2022 census, 54.6% of the population reported their first language as Afrikaans, 35.7% as Setswana, 4.5% as Xhosa, and 2.4% as English. The Northern Cape is the only province in which native Afrikaans-speakers form a majority of the population. It is also the province with the second-highest proportion of Setswana speakers, after North West province.

=== Religion ===
The population of the Northern Cape is overwhelmingly Christian. As of the 2022 census, 97.8% of the population described themselves as Christians, the highest proportion among South Africa&#x27;s provinces. Among other religions, 0.8% of the population described themselves as Muslim, and 0.7% of the population stated that they practiced Traditional African religions. Only 0.3% of the population described themselves as being atheist, agnostic, or having no religious affiliation.

== Government and Politics ==

=== Government ===

The Northern Cape provincial government is based in Kimberley, the provincial capital. The Northern Cape Division of the High Court of South Africa also sits in Kimberley. 

Like South Africa&#x27;s other provinces, the Northern Cape has a parliamentary system of government, with the provincial premier elected by the Northern Cape Provincial Legislature. The premier then selects the members of the provincial Executive Council (cabinet). The current premier is Zamani Saul of the African National Congress (ANC), who has held the position since 2019.

The provincial legislature is elected every five years by a system of party-list proportional representation. In the most recent provincial election, held in 2024, the ANC won a plurality of the vote but failed to win an overall majority of seats. After the election, the ANC declined to form a formal coalition, but the ANC&#x27;s Zamani Saul was reelected as premier with support from the Patriotic Alliance and Freedom Front Plus. The Democratic Alliance (DA) is the second largest party in the province and forms the official opposition. 

The results of the most recent provincial election in 2024 are as follows:

=== Political History ===

The ANC consistently has been the largest party in the Northern Cape since the end of Apartheid, although its position has been less dominant than it traditionally has been in most other provinces. In the first democratic provincial elections in 1994, the ANC emerged as the largest party but failed to win an overall majority of seats. In order to form a majority in the provincial legislature, the ANC reached an agreement with the Democratic Party (DP), which voted for the ANC&#x27;s Manne Dipico as premier in exchange for the election of the DP&#x27;s sole MLP, Ethne Papenfus, as speaker of the legislature. The National Party formed the official opposition.

In the 1999 provincial election, the ANC substantially increased its vote share and won an overall majority in the provincial legislature. Thereafter the ANC would continue to maintain a majority in the legislature until 2024. 

After the 2004 election, the ANC&#x27;s Dipuo Peters replaced Dipico as Premier, and the Democratic Alliance (DA) replaced the New National Party as the official opposition. Following the 2009 election, which was again won the by ANC, the ANC&#x27;s Hazel Jenkins became the new Premier, while the Congress of the People (COPE), a new splinter party from the ANC, had a strong showing and replaced the DA as the official opposition. Jenkins was later replaced as Premier by Sylvia Lucas in 2013.

The 2014 election saw the ANC returned to power once again with an increased mandate, while DA once again became the official opposition, after the collapse of COPE. The newly formed Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) also entered the legislature for the first time. Sylvia Lucas was re-elected to her first full term as premier.

In the 2019 election, the Northern Cape was considered competitive, with the DA hoping to win the province. In the end, the ANC returned as the majority party, albeit with a reduced majority. The DA was once again the official opposition with an increased seat total. The EFF made gains, while the Freedom Front Plus (FF+) won a seat in the legislature for the first time since 2004. Zamani Saul replaced Lucas as premier after the election.

==Municipalities==

The Northern Cape Province is divided into five district municipalities. The district municipalities are in turn divided into 27 local municipalities:

== Economy ==

As reported by the Northern Cape Provincial Government, unemployment still remains a big issue in the province. Unemployment was reported to be at 24.9% during Q4, 2013. Unemployment also declined from 119,000 in Q4, 2012 to 109,000 in Q4, 2013.

The Northern Cape is also home to the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), which is located 75 km North-West of Carnarvon.

The economy of the Northern Cape relies heavily on two sectors, mining and agriculture, which employ 57% (Tertiary Sector) of all employees in the province.
Most famous for the diamond mines around Kimberley, it also has mining activities for Manganese and iron ore.

The Northern Cape also has a substantial agricultural area around the Orange River, including most of South Africa&#x27;s sultana vineyards. Some Wine of Origin areas have been demarcated. The Orange River also attracts visitors who enjoy rafting tours around Vioolsdrif. Extensive sheep raising is the basis of the economy in the southern Karoo areas of the province.

<text>North West (; ) is a province of South Africa. Its capital is Mahikeng. The province is located to the west of the major population centre and province of Gauteng and south of Botswana.

==History==
North West was incorporated after the end of apartheid in 1994, and includes parts of the former Transvaal Province and Cape Province, as well as most of the former bantustan of Bophuthatswana. It was the scene of political violence in Khutsong, Merafong City Local Municipality in 2006 and 2007, after cross-province municipalities were abolished and Merafong Municipality was transferred entirely to North West. Merafong has since been transferred to Gauteng province in 2009.

This province is the birthplace of prominent political figures: Lucas Mangope, Moses Kotane, Ahmed Kathrada, Abram Onkgopotse Tiro, Ruth Mompati, J. B. Marks, Aziz Pahad, and Essop Pahad, among others.

==Law and government==
The Provincial Government consists of a premier, an executive council of ten ministers, and a legislature. The provincial assembly and premier are elected for five-year terms, or until the next national election. Political parties are awarded assembly seats based on the percentage of votes each party receives in the province during the national elections. The assembly elects a premier, who then appoints the members of the executive council.

The premier of North West Province as of 14 June 2024 is Lazzy Mokgosi of the African National Congress.

==Geography==
Much of the province consists of flat areas of scattered trees and grassland. The Magaliesberg mountain range in the northeast extends about 130 km (about 80 miles) from Pretoria to Rustenburg. The Vaal River flows along the southern border of the province.

===Climate===
Temperatures range from in the summer and from in the winter. Annual rainfall totals about 360 mm (about 14 in), with almost all of it falling during the summer months, between October and April.

===Borders===
North West borders the following districts of Botswana:
*Kgatleng – far northeast
*South-East – northeast
*Southern – north
*Kgalagadi – northwest
Domestically, it borders the following provinces:
*Limpopo – northeast
*Gauteng – east
*Free State – southeast
*Northern Cape – southwest

North West Province is traversed by the northwesterly line of equal latitude and longitude.

==Municipalities==


The North West Province is divided into four district municipalities. The district municipalities are in turn divided into 18 local municipalities:

==Economy==

The mainstay of the economy of North West Province is mining, which generates more than half of the province&#x27;s gross domestic product and provides jobs for a quarter of its workforce. The chief minerals are gold, mined at Orkney and Klerksdorp; uranium, mined at Klerksdorp; platinum, mined at Rustenburg and Brits; and diamonds, mined at Lichtenburg, Christiana, and Bloemhof. About 85% of all money-making activities take place between Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom. The economic heart of the province is Klerksdorp. The northern and western parts of the province have many sheep farms and cattle and game ranches. The eastern and southern parts are crop-growing regions that produce maize (corn), sunflowers, tobacco, cotton, and citrus fruits. The entertainment and casino complex at Sun City and Lost City also contributes to the provincial economy.

==Demographics==
The majority of the province&#x27;s residents are Tswana people who speak Tswana, as in neighbouring Botswana. Smaller groups include Afrikaans, Sotho, and Xhosa speaking people. English is spoken primarily as a second language. Most of the population belong to Christian denominations. (Figures according to Census 2001 released in July 2003).

According to the 2007 community survey 90.8% of the province&#x27;s population was Black (mostly Tswana-speaking), 7.2% as White (mostly Afrikaans speaking), 1.6% as Coloured and 0.4% as Asian. The 2007 community survey showed the province had a population of just over 3 million. The province&#x27;s white population is very unevenly distributed. In the southern and eastern municipalities, the white percentage in double figures such as the Tlokwe and Matlosana where the white percentages were 27% and 12% respectively.

The province has the lowest number of people aged 35 years and older (5.9%) who have received higher education. Since 1994 the number of people receiving higher education has increased. After the disbanding of the bantustans, many people migrated to the economic centres of Cape Town and Gauteng.

==Education==
The province had two universities: the North-West University, which was formerly called the University of Bophuthatswana (founded in 1979), in Mmabatho; and Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education (founded in 1869; became a constituent college of the University of South Africa in 1921 and an independent university in 1951). These two universities have now merged and the new institution is called North-West University.

As part of the Department of Education&#x27;s proposed plans for higher education, the existing four higher learning institutions will be merged to form two. During 2003, as part of the Year of Further Education and Training project, three mega institutions, Taletso, ORBIT and Vuselela, were established to provide technical and vocational training to the youth. These institutions have been incorporated into many of the former education and technical colleges and manpower centres.

**Platinum Leopards (Rustenburg)

<text>Hostius an ancient Roman poet. He is most famous for writing the lost poem &quot;Bellum Histricum&quot;, which was at least two books long. It is uncertain which Istrian war was the subject of this poem, but scholars generally consider the second war (129 BC) is more likely, as the first (178–7) had already been treated by Ennius in his &quot;Annales&quot;. Only seven fragments of Hostius&#x27; poem survive, but it was probably in the panegyric style which was common in the Hellenistic period.

Based on a reference to a &quot;doctus avus&quot; (&quot;learned ancestor&quot;) in a poem by Propertius, many scholars believe that his lover Cynthia – whose real name was apparently Hostia – was descended from Hostius. Edward Courtney doubts this, arguing that the girl addressed in the poem is not Cynthia.

<doc id="447020" wikidata="Q1182161" url="?curid=447020" title="Dedekind eta function">
<text>In mathematics, the Dedekind eta function, named after Richard Dedekind, is a modular form of weight 1/2 and is a function defined on the upper half-plane of complex numbers, where the imaginary part is positive. It also occurs in bosonic string theory.

==Definition==
For any complex number with , let ; then the eta function is defined by,

:formula_1

Raising the eta equation to the 24th power and multiplying by gives

:formula_2

where is the modular discriminant. The presence of 24 can be understood by connection with other occurrences, such as in the 24-dimensional Leech lattice.

The eta function is holomorphic on the upper half-plane but cannot be continued analytically beyond it.


The eta function satisfies the functional equations

:formula_3

In the second equation the branch of the square root is chosen such that when .

More generally, suppose are integers with , so that

:formula_4

is a transformation belonging to the modular group. We may assume that either , or and . Then

:formula_5

where

:formula_6

Here is the Dedekind sum

:formula_7

Because of these functional equations the eta function is a modular form of weight and level 1 for a certain character of order 24 of the metaplectic double cover of the modular group, and can be used to define other modular forms. In particular the modular discriminant of the Weierstrass elliptic function with

:formula_8

can be defined as

:formula_9

and is a modular form of weight 12. Some authors omit the factor of , so that the series expansion has integral coefficients.

The Jacobi triple product implies that the eta is (up to a factor) a Jacobi theta function for special values of the arguments:

:formula_10

where is &quot;the&quot; Dirichlet character modulo 12 with and . Explicitly,

:formula_11
The Euler function

:formula_12

has a power series by the Euler identity:

:formula_13

Note that by using Euler Pentagonal number theorem for formula_14, the eta function can be expressed as

:formula_15
This can be proved by using formula_16 in Euler Pentagonal number theorem with the definition of eta function.

Because the eta function is easy to compute numerically from either power series, it is often helpful in computation to express other functions in terms of it when possible, and products and quotients of eta functions, called eta quotients, can be used to express a great variety of modular forms.

The picture on this page shows the modulus of the Euler function: the additional factor of between this and eta makes almost no visual difference whatsoever. Thus, this picture can be taken as a picture of eta as a function of .

== Combinatorial identities ==
The theory of the algebraic characters of the affine Lie algebras gives rise to a large class of previously unknown identities for the eta function. These identities follow from the Weyl–Kac character formula, and more specifically from the so-called &quot;denominator identities&quot;. The characters themselves allow the construction of generalizations of the Jacobi theta function which transform under the modular group; this is what leads to the identities. An example of one such new identity is

:formula_17
where is the -analog or &quot;deformation&quot; of the highest weight of a module.

==Special values==
From the above connection with the Euler function together with the special values of the latter, it can be easily deduced that

: formula_18

==Eta quotients==
Eta quotients are defined by quotients of the form
:formula_19
where is a non-negative integer and is any integer. Linear combinations of eta quotients at imaginary quadratic arguments may be algebraic, while combinations of eta quotients may even be integral. For example, define,

:formula_20

with the 24th power of the Weber modular function . Then,

:formula_21

and so on, values which appear in Ramanujan–Sato series.

Eta quotients may also be a useful tool for describing bases of modular forms, which are notoriously difficult to compute and express directly. In 1993 Basil Gordon and Kim Hughes proved that if an eta quotient of the form given above, namely formula_19 satisfies
:formula_23
then is a weight modular form for the congruence subgroup (up to holomorphicity) where 
:formula_24
This result was extended in 2019 such that the converse holds for cases when is coprime to 6, and it remains open that the original theorem is sharp for all integers . This also extends to state that any modular eta quotient for any level congruence subgroup must also be a modular form for the group . While these theorems characterize modular eta quotients, the condition of holomorphicity must be checked separately using a theorem that emerged from the work of Gérard Ligozat and Yves Martin:

If is an eta quotient satisfying the above conditions for the integer and and are coprime integers, then the order of vanishing at the cusp relative to is 
:formula_25
These theorems provide an effective means of creating holomorphic modular eta quotients, however this may not be sufficient to construct a basis for a vector space of modular forms and cusp forms. A useful theorem for limiting the number of modular eta quotients to consider states that a holomorphic weight modular eta quotient on must satisfy
:formula_26
where denotes the largest integer such that divides .
These results lead to several characterizations of spaces of modular forms that can be spanned by modular eta quotients. Using the graded ring structure on the ring of modular forms, we can compute bases of vector spaces of modular forms composed of -linear combinations of eta-quotients. For example, if we assume is a semiprime then the following process can be used to compute an eta-quotient basis of .

<doc id="447022" wikidata="Q5153034" url="?curid=447022" title="Committee of the Whole (United States House of Representatives)">
<text>In the United States House of Representatives, a Committee of the Whole House is a congressional committee that includes all members of the House. In modern practice there is only one such committee, the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, which has original consideration of all bills on the Union Calendar. While assembled, the House may resolve itself temporarily into a Committee of the Whole House. Business can then proceed with various procedural requirements relaxed. At the conclusion of business, the committee resolves to &quot;rise&quot; and reports its conclusions (typically in the form of an amended bill) or lack of conclusion to the speaker.

When the House resolves into a Committee of the Whole House, the speaker appoints another member to the chair, and this member is responsible for delivering the committee&#x27;s report. Conventionally, the speaker appoints a member of the majority party who does not hold the chair of a standing committee. A Committee of the Whole House requires 100 members for a quorum as compared to the House&#x27;s majority of 218, while only 25 members are required to force a recorded (rather than voice) vote as compared to the typical requirement of one-fifth of the members present.

==History==
The tradition of a committee of the whole originates in the English House of Commons, where it is attested as early as 1607. In only a few years it became a near-daily process used to debate matters without representatives of the Crown present, and the custom was subsequently adopted by deliberative assemblies in other Crown provinces. The American Continental Congress, for example, established committees of the whole &quot;to take into consideration the state of America.&quot;

The rules of the House in the 1st United States Congress expressly provided for the House, on any business day, to resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union. This procedure was used to discuss matters for which no specific action had been decided. Since 1807, the Committee has also been the recipient of the President&#x27;s messages on the State of the Union. Other &quot;ad hoc&quot; committees of the whole were established and charged through the normal committee process, but in time, a custom developed whereby the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union considered public bills and a separate Committee of the Whole House considered all private bills. The Committee of the Whole House for private bills was abolished by the 106th Congress, which transferred their consideration to the House proper.

For most of the House&#x27;s history, votes in the Committee of the Whole were off record. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 provided for the recording of votes by name upon the request of 25 members, which is routine for amendment votes.

==Participation of non-voting delegates==

In 1993, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), along with the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico and the delegates from Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa, received a limited vote in the Committee of the Whole, based on their right to vote in legislative committees. However, this limited vote stipulated if any of the delegates provided the deciding vote on an issue considered by the Committee of the Whole, a new vote would be conducted and the delegates would not be allowed to vote. The right of delegates to vote in Committee of the Whole was removed by the Republican majority in 1995 after that party gained control of Congress in the 1994 congressional elections. In January 2007, it was proposed by Democrats in the House that the 1993–1994 procedure be revived. The House approved the proposal with the adoption of by a vote of 226–191.

On January 5, 2011, at the start of the 112th Congress, the Republican-controlled House voted for a rules package that included stripping non-voting delegates of their votes in the Committee of the Whole. Del. Norton proposed tabling the motion pending further study of the non-voting delegate issue, but was defeated in a 225–188 party-line vote. At the start of each new Congress since 2011, Del. Norton and her fellow non-voting delegates have sought restoration of the right to vote in the Committee of the Whole but House Republicans have not voted in favor of the proposal.

The delegates from the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, along with the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, have proposed several bipartisan rule changes for the 116th Congress, including restoring their vote in the Committee of the Whole. When Democrats regained control in the 116th United States Congress, they again reinstated the right of delegates to vote in the committee of the whole.

==Former use in the Senate==
Until 1930, the United States Senate considered all bills in the committee of the whole, or &quot;quasi-committee,&quot; before a final debate. The usual rules of debate applied, but only amendments could be considered and tentatively approved. It was possible for a bill to go through four debates: consideration and reconsideration in quasi-committee, then final consideration and reconsideration in the Senate. This practice ended for bills and joint resolutions in 1930, and for treaties in 1986.

<doc id="447030" wikidata="Q190368" url="?curid=447030" title="Appian">
<text>Appian of Alexandria (; ; ; ) was a Greek historian with Roman citizenship who prospered during the reigns of the Roman Emperors Trajan, Hadrian, and Antoninus Pius.

He was born c. 95 in Alexandria. After holding the senior offices in the province of Aegyptus (Egypt), he went to Rome c. 120, where he practiced as an advocate, pleading cases before the emperors (probably as &quot;advocatus fisci&quot;, an important official of the imperial treasury). It was in 147 at the earliest that he was appointed to the office of procurator, probably in Egypt, on the recommendation of his friend Marcus Cornelius Fronto, an influential rhetorician and advocate. Because the position of procurator was open only to members of the equestrian order (the &quot;knightly&quot; class), his possession of this office tells us about Appian&#x27;s family background.

His principal surviving work (Ρωμαϊκά &quot;Romaiká&quot;, known in Latin as &quot;Historia Romana&quot; and in English as &quot;Roman History&quot;) was written in Greek in 24 books, before 165. This work more closely resembles a series of monographs than a connected history. It gives an account of various peoples and countries from the earliest times down to their incorporation into the Roman Empire, and survives in complete books and considerable fragments. The work is very valuable, especially for the period of the civil wars.

&quot;The Civil Wars&quot;, books 13–17 of the &quot;Roman History&quot;, concern mainly the end of the Roman Republic and take a conflict-based view and approach to history. Despite the lack of cited sources for his works, these books of the &quot;Roman History&quot; are the only extant comprehensive description of these momentous decades of Roman history. The other extant work of Appian is his &quot;The Foreign Wars&quot;, which includes an ethnographic style history recounting the various military conflicts against a foreign enemy in Roman history, until the time of Appian.

== Life ==
Little is known of the life of Appian of Alexandria. He wrote an autobiography that has been almost completely lost. Information about Appian is distilled from his own writings and a letter by his friend Cornelius Fronto. However, it is certain that Appian was born around the year AD 95 in Alexandria, the capital of Roman Egypt. Since his parents were Roman citizens capable of paying for their son&#x27;s education, it can be inferred that Appian belonged to the wealthy upper classes.

It is believed that Appian moved to Rome in 120, where he became a lawyer. In the introduction to his &quot;Roman History,&quot; he boasts &quot;that he pleaded cases in Rome before the emperors.&quot; The emperors he claims to have addressed must have been either Hadrian or Marcus Aurelius and definitely Antoninus Pius, for Appian remained in Egypt at least until the end of the reign of Trajan (117). In the letter of Cornelius Fronto, it is revealed that a request on behalf of Appian to receive the rank of procurator occurred during the co-regency of Marcus Aurelius and his brother Lucius Verus between 147 and 161. Although Appian won this office, it is unclear whether it was a real job or an honorific title. The only other certain biographical datum is that Appian&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot; appeared sometime before 162. This is one of the few primary historical sources for the period.

== Works ==
===Appian&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot; and &quot;The Civil Wars&quot;===

Appian began writing his history around the middle of the second century AD. 
Only sections from half of the original 24 books survive today of a much larger history known as &quot;The Roman History&quot;, namely books 6-7, much of 8, 9, and 11, and 12-17 (only fragments of books 1-5 and of the remainder of 8 and 9 are preserved, while books 10 and 18-24 are lost entirely). The section of this history known as &quot;The Civil Wars&quot; comprises books 13–17 of the original 24 of the &quot;Roman History&quot;. This history narrates the history of the Romans from the time of the Gracchan tribunates, through the civil wars of Marius, Sulla, Caesar and Pompey, to break off in the time of the Second Triumvirate. These five books stand out because they are one of the few comprehensive histories available on the transition of the Roman state from Republic to Empire and the ensuing civil and military strife.

Besides Appian, this period is also covered by a handful of ancient authors with varying degrees of detail and viewpoints. The commentaries of Julius Caesar record his personal, mainly military, observations of the Gallic Wars. Plutarch&#x27;s Roman biographies sketch the lives of the major leaders of the late Republican period, recording events Plutarch thought interesting and give only a perfunctory explanation of historic events. The Roman author Velleius&#x27; history examines Roman history from the city&#x27;s foundation until AD 29. This history is more detailed in the late Republic and early Empire period, while the earlier history is condensed. The &quot;Epitome of Roman History&quot; by Florus, also covers Roman history from mythical times until the 5th century AD in an extremely condensed format. The history of Diodorus of Sicily also covers Roman history until the Gallic Wars, but his history becomes fragmentary after around 300 BC.

===&quot;The Foreign Wars&quot;===
Another work of Appian&#x27;s history which still survives mostly extant is called &quot;The Foreign Wars&quot;. This history describes the wars the Romans fought against other cultures throughout their history. The mostly extant work narrates the wars in Spain (book 6), the Punic Wars in both Italy and Africa (books 7 and 8), the wars against the Seleucid Empire (book 11), and the Mithridatic Wars (book 12). Several small fragments also survive, describing the early Roman Kingdom (book 1) and the wars against the central Italians (book 2), Samnites (book 3), Illyrians (book 9), Macedonians (book 9), Numidians (book 8), and the Gauls (book 4). Especially notable is this work&#x27;s ethnographic structure. Appian most likely used this structure to facilitate his readers&#x27; orientation through the sequence of events, which are united only by their relationship to Rome. For example, the chapter on Spain recounts Roman history in Spain chronologically with the Romans&#x27; first intervention in Spain during the War with Hannibal. The book goes on to describe the Roman conquest of several regions of Spain, followed by their wars with Spanish tribes and the Numantine War. The chapter on Spain concludes with the war against Sertorius in roughly 61 BC. Likewise, the chapter on the Hannibalic wars only recounts the battles that took place on the Italian Peninsula during the second Punic war, while the chapters on the Punic War recount all the action that occurred in northern Africa during the first and second Punic war.

Of the books which are now entirely lost, book 10 described the wars in Greece and Ionia, books 18-21 discussed Egypt, book 22 covered the history of the Empire up to the reign of Trajan, book 23 covered Trajan&#x27;s wars against the Dacians, the Jews, and the Parthians, and book 24 described his annexation of Arabia Petraea.

===Sources===

One might expect that a historical work covering nine centuries and countless different peoples would involve a multitude of sources from different periods. However, Appian&#x27;s sources remain uncertain, as he only mentions the source of his information under special circumstances. He may have relied primarily on one author for each book, whom he did not follow uncritically, since Appian also used additional sources for precision and correction. At our present state of knowledge questions regarding Appian&#x27;s sources cannot be resolved.

<text>The Calabash Nebula, also known as the Rotten Egg Nebula or by its technical name OH 231.84 +4.22, is a protoplanetary nebula (PPN) 1.4 light years (13 Pm) long and located some 5,000 light years (47 Em) from Earth in the constellation Puppis. The name &quot;Calabash Nebula&quot; was first proposed in 1989 in an early paper on its expected nebular dynamics, based on the nebula&#x27;s appearance.
The Calabash is almost certainly a member of the open cluster Messier 46, as it has the same distance, radial velocity, and proper motion. The central star is QX Puppis, a binary composed of a very cool Mira variable and an A-type main-sequence star.

==Description==
Violent gas collisions that produced supersonic shock fronts in a dying star are seen in a detailed image from NASA&#x27;s Hubble Space Telescope.

The object is sometimes called the Rotten Egg Nebula as it contains a relatively large amount of sulphur. The densest parts of the nebula are composed of material ejected recently by the central star and accelerated in opposite directions. This material, shown as yellow in the image, is zooming away at speeds up to one and a half million kilometers per hour (one million miles per hour). Most of the star&#x27;s original mass is now contained in these bipolar gas structures.

A team of Spanish and US astronomers used NASA&#x27;s Hubble Space Telescope to study how the gas stream rams into the surrounding material, shown in blue. They believe that such interactions dominate the formation process in planetary nebulae. Due to the high speed of the gas, shock-fronts are formed on impact and heat the surrounding gases. Although computer calculations had predicted the existence and structure of such shocks for some time, previous observations had not been able to prove the theory.

This new Hubble image used filters that only let through light from ionized hydrogen and nitrogen atoms. Astronomers were able to distinguish the warmest parts of the gas heated by the violent shocks and found that they form a complex double-bubble shape. The bright yellow-orange colors in the picture show how dense, high-speed gas is flowing from the star, like supersonic speeding bullets ripping through a medium in opposite directions. The central star itself is hidden in the dusty band at the center.

Much of the gas flow observed today seems to stem from a sudden acceleration that took place about 800 years ago. Astronomers believe that 1,000 years from now, the Calabash Nebula will become a fully developed planetary nebula.

==Ground-based imagery==
In wide field images, the Calabash nebula is visible near the bright planetary nebula NGC 2438 in deep photographs. Although the Calabash Nebula is at the same distance as M46, NGC 2438 is a larger object in the foreground.

<doc id="447035" wikidata="Q973313" url="?curid=447035" title="Dirichlet eta function">
<text>In mathematics, in the area of analytic number theory, the Dirichlet eta function is defined by the following Dirichlet series, which converges for any complex number having real part &gt; 0:
formula_1

This Dirichlet series is the alternating sum corresponding to the Dirichlet series expansion of the Riemann zeta function, &quot;ζ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) — and for this reason the Dirichlet eta function is also known as the alternating zeta function, also denoted &quot;ζ&quot;*(&quot;s&quot;). The following relation holds:
formula_2

Both the Dirichlet eta function and the Riemann zeta function are special cases of polylogarithms.

While the Dirichlet series expansion for the eta function is convergent only for any complex number &quot;s&quot; with real part &gt; 0, it is Abel summable for any complex number. This serves to define the eta function as an entire function. (The above relation and the facts that the eta function is entire and formula_3 together show the zeta function is meromorphic with a simple pole at &quot;s&quot; = 1, and possibly additional poles at the other zeros of the factor formula_4, although in fact these hypothetical additional poles do not exist.)

Equivalently, we may begin by defining
formula_5
which is also defined in the region of positive real part (formula_6 represents the gamma function). This gives the eta function as a Mellin transform.

Hardy gave a simple proof of the functional equation for the eta function, which is
formula_7

From this, one immediately has the functional equation of the zeta function also, as well as another means to extend the definition of eta to the entire complex plane.

==Zeros==
The zeros of the eta function include all the zeros of the zeta function: the negative even integers (real equidistant simple zeros); the zeros along the critical line, none of which are known to be multiple and over 40% of which have been proven to be simple, and the hypothetical zeros in the critical strip but not on the critical line, which if they do exist must occur at the vertices of rectangles symmetrical around the &quot;x&quot;-axis and the critical line and whose multiplicity is unknown. In addition, the factor formula_4 adds an infinite number of complex simple zeros, located at equidistant points on the line formula_9, at formula_10 where &quot;n&quot; is any nonzero integer.

The zeros of the eta function are located symmetrically with respect to the real axis and under the Riemann hypothesis would be on two parallel lines formula_11, and on the perpendicular half line formed by the negative real axis.

==Landau&#x27;s problem with &quot;ζ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) = &quot;η&quot;(&quot;s&quot;)/ (1 − 21−s) and solutions==
In the equation , &quot;the pole of at is cancelled by the zero of the other factor&quot; (Titchmarsh, 1986, p. 17), and as a result is neither infinite nor zero (see ). However, in the equation
formula_12
&quot;η&quot; must be zero at all the points formula_13, where the denominator is zero, if the Riemann zeta function is analytic and finite there. The problem of proving this without defining the zeta function first was signaled and left open by E. Landau in his 1909 treatise on number theory: &quot;Whether the eta series is different from zero or not at the points formula_14, i.e., whether these are poles of zeta or not, is not readily apparent here.&quot;

A first solution for Landau&#x27;s problem was published almost 40 years later by D. V. Widder in his book The Laplace Transform. It uses the next prime 3 instead of 2 to define a Dirichlet series similar to the eta function, which we will call the formula_15 function, defined for formula_16 and with some zeros also on formula_9, but not equal to those of eta.
&lt;/math&gt;
or
formula_18

Since formula_19 is irrational, the denominators in the two definitions are not zero at the same time except for formula_20, and the formula_21 function is thus well defined and analytic for formula_16 except at formula_20. We finally get indirectly that formula_24 when formula_14:
formula_26

An elementary direct and formula_27-independent proof of the vanishing of the eta function at formula_14 was published by J. Sondow in 2003. It expresses the value of the eta function as the limit of special Riemann sums associated to an integral known to be zero, using a relation between the partial sums of the Dirichlet series defining the eta and zeta functions for formula_29.

 =\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{\left(-\log(x y)\right)^{s-2}}{1 + x y} \, dx \, dy.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The Cauchy–Schlömilch transformation (Amdeberhan, Moll et al., 2010) can be used to prove this other representation, valid for formula_30. Integration by parts of the first integral above in this section yields another derivation.

formula_31

The next formula, due to Lindelöf (1905), is valid over the whole complex plane, when the principal value is taken for the logarithm implicit in the exponential.
formula_32
This corresponds to a Jensen (1895) formula for the entire function 
formula_33, valid over the whole complex plane and also proven by Lindelöf.
formula_34
&quot;This formula, remarquable by its simplicity, can be proven easily with the help of Cauchy&#x27;s theorem, so important for the summation of series&quot; wrote Jensen (1895). Similarly by converting the integration paths to contour integrals one can obtain other formulas for the eta function, such as this generalisation (Milgram, 2013) valid for formula_35 and all formula_36:
formula_37
The zeros on the negative real axis are factored out cleanly by making formula_38 (Milgram, 2013) to obtain a formula valid for formula_39:
formula_40

==Numerical algorithms==
Most of the series acceleration techniques developed for alternating series can be profitably applied to the evaluation of the eta function. One particularly simple, yet reasonable method is to apply Euler&#x27;s transformation of alternating series, to obtain
formula_41

Note that the second, inside summation is a forward difference.

=== Borwein&#x27;s method ===
Peter Borwein used approximations involving Chebyshev polynomials to produce a method for efficient evaluation of the eta function. If
formula_42
then
formula_43
where for formula_44 the error term is bounded by
formula_45

The factor of formula_46 in the error bound indicates that the Borwein series converges quite rapidly as &quot;n&quot; increases.

==Particular values==

*&quot;η&quot;(0) = , the Abel sum of Grandi&#x27;s series 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ⋯.
*&quot;η&quot;(−1) = , the Abel sum of 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ⋯.
*For positive integer &quot;k&quot;,
formula_47 where is the &quot;k&quot;-th Bernoulli number.

Also:
*formula_48, this is the alternating harmonic series
*formula_49 
*formula_50
*formula_51
*formula_52
*formula_53
*formula_54

The general form for even positive integers is:
formula_55

Taking the limit formula_56, one obtains formula_57.

<doc id="447039" wikidata="Q36443" url="?curid=447039" title="East Low German">
<text>East Low German () is a group of Low German dialects spoken in north-eastern Germany as well as by minorities in northern Poland. Together with West Low German dialects, it forms a dialect continuum of the Low German language. Before 1945, the dialect was spoken along the entire then-German-settled Baltic Coast from Mecklenburg, through Pomerania, West Prussia into certain villages of the East Prussian Klaipėda Region.

East Pomeranian, Central Pomeranian and West Pomeranian should not be confused with the West Slavic Pomeranian language ().

==Related languages==
East Low German belongs to the dialect continuum of the West Germanic languages. It developed from the older Middle Low German.

In the West it fades into West Low German. The distinction is usually made referring to the plural endings of the verbs: East Low German endings are based on the old first person ending: -e(n), whereas West Low German endings are based on the old second person ending: -(e)t. The categorization of the Low German dialects into an Eastern and a Western group is not made by all linguists.

In the South, it fades into East Central German. The difference is that the East Low German varieties have not been affected by the High German consonant shift. The areas affected by the High German consonant shift are still expanding today, especially the Berlinerisch dialect that is gaining ground on the Brandenburgisch dialect by which it is surrounded.

==Dialects==
East Low German dialects are:
* Mecklenburgisch-Vorpommersch (in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern)
* Brandenburgisch or Märkisch-Brandenburgisch (&quot;Brandenburgish&quot;; in Brandenburg, northern Saxony-Anhalt)
* Middle Pomeranian () 
* East Pomeranian (in Farther Pomerania)
* Low Prussian (in West Prussia and East Prussia)

Instead of &quot;Mecklenburgisch-Vorpommersch&quot; also &quot;Mecklenburgisch&quot; and &quot;Vorpommersch&quot; are used.

For some it also includes Plautdietsch (originating from Danzig), which is spoken by Mennonites in North America, Mexico and a few other places in the world. In Berlin a version of Brandenburgisch was spoken in medieval times until the city took up an East Central German dialect that incorporated Brandenburgisch elements and developed into today&#x27;s Berlin[er]isch.

The German dialects of Pomerania are compiled and described in the &quot;Pommersches Wörterbuch&quot; (&quot;Pomeranian Dictionary&quot;), a dictionary of the German dialects spoken within the Province of Pomerania&#x27;s borders in 1936.

East Pomeranian dialect of East Low German is also spoken in Brazil (see Pomerode, in Santa Catarina, Santa Maria de Jetibá, in Espírito Santo, and Arroio do Padre, Morro Redondo, Turuçu, Canguçu, São Lourenço do Sul and Pelotas, in Rio Grande do Sul).

== History ==

By the early Middle Ages, Pomerania was largely populated by Slavic Pomeranians and Liuticians, who spoke the Pomeranian and Polabian languages. During the High Middle Ages, Germans from northern parts of the Holy Roman Empire settled in Pomerania as part of the medieval Ostsiedlung. Most Slavic Pomeranians gradually became Germanized. The new Pomeranian dialects which emerged from the admixture of the Low German dialects of the settlers are classified as East Low German.

After World War II, Germans east of the Oder-Neisse line were expelled to post-war Germany. Most varieties of East Pomeranian dialect have largely died out in the following decades as the expellees were assimilated into their new homes, although West Pomeranian and Central Pomeranian are still spoken in Vorpommern (Western or Hither Pomerania), part of the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

As a result of German immigration to Brazil, there are still some communities speaking East Pomeranian in Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Espírito Santo.

==Writers==
Fritz Reuter and Heinrich Bandlow are among the most famous East Low German writers.

<doc id="447040" wikidata="Q7928440" url="?curid=447040" title="Viet D. Dinh">
<text>Viet D. Dinh (; born February 22, 1968) is a Vietnamese-born American legal scholar who is on the board of Strategic Education. He is also the Chief Legal and Policy Officer of Fox Corporation where he leads all legal, government and regulatory and government affairs. He served as an Assistant Attorney General of the United States from 2001 to 2003, under the presidency of George W. Bush. Previously, Dinh was a partner at two leading law firms, Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP and Bancroft PLLC, the latter of which he founded. Born in Saigon, in former South Vietnam, he was a major contributor to the Patriot Act and is a former member of the Board of Directors of News Corporation.

==Early life and education==
Dinh was born in Saigon, South Vietnam. He and his family emigrated to the United States in 1978, three years after Vietnam had fully embraced communism. They initially settled in Portland, Oregon, but moved to Fullerton, California, two years later. Dinh joined the restarted debate team at Fullerton Union High School under coaches Gary Reed and Jacqueline Reedy as a senior, who encouraged him to apply to Harvard University.

Dinh graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Harvard University in 1990 with a B.A. in government and economics. While at Harvard, he was a member of the Phoenix S.K. Club. He then attended Harvard Law School, where he was a Class Marshal, an Olin Research Fellow in Law and Economics, and &quot;Bluebook&quot; editor of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;. He received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1993.

==Career==
===Law===
After graduating from law school, Dinh served as a law clerk to Judge Laurence H. Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor during the 1994 Term.

Dinh has served as Associate Special Counsel to the U.S. Senate Whitewater Committee, as Special Counsel to Senator Pete V. Domenici for the Impeachment Trial of President Bill Clinton, and as counsel to the Special Master in re Austrian and German Bank Holocaust Litigation.

He is a member of the District of Columbia and Supreme Court bars.

In late 2003, he was one of a group of prominent U.S. security officials hired by ChoicePoint to advise the company on developing its government homeland security contracts.

In 2006 he joined Kenneth Starr in challenging the constitutionality of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act.

Dinh currently serves on or has served on the boards of the News Corporation, The Orchard Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ; ORCD), Liberty&#x27;s Promise, the American Judicature Society, the Transition Committee for California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Section on National Security Law of the Association of American Law Schools, the ABA Section on Administrative Law, Revlon, LPL Financial, and McAndrews and Forbes Worldwide.

Dinh has taught at Georgetown University Law Center, and became a partner at Kirkland &amp; Ellis in September 2016, when Kirkland hired all of the attorneys at the firm Dinh founded, Bancroft PLLC. Dinh left Kirkland in 2018.

Dinh&#x27;s representative publications include &quot;Defending Liberty: Terrorism and Human Rights&quot; in the &quot;Helsinki Monitor&quot;, &quot;Codetermination and Corporate Governance in a Multinational Business Enterprise&quot; in the &quot;Journal of Corporation Law&quot;, and &quot;Financial Sector Reform and Economic Development in Vietnam&quot; in &quot;Law and Policy in International Business&quot;. He published &quot;The USA Patriot Act: Preserving Life and Liberty&quot; in 2008.

In September 2006 Dinh received publicity for representing Tom Perkins, a former Hewlett-Packard director involved in the company&#x27;s pretexting scandal. The emails between Perkins and Larry Sonsini, a corporate lawyer involved with Board of Directors decisions for many corporations were eventually forwarded to reporters and became public.

Dinh, along with fellow News Corp. board member, fellow lawyer, and Corporation executive Joel Klein, took over the investigation of the News of the World phone hacking affair and related Corporation issues in July, 2011, from News International UK Chief Executive, Rebekah Brooks. Brooks&#x27; own possible involvement in the phone hacking scandal made her unable to continue as an impartial investigator. Tom Perkins, also on the News Corp. board, was one who recommended Dinh for the investigation role.

It emerged after he was appointed to the board investigation that Dinh is godfather to one of Lachlan Murdoch&#x27;s children and a friend of Lachlan since 2003. Further, in 1992, a decade before he met Lachlan, Dinh wrote of his sister, held in a Hong Kong refugee camp, in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, which led to NBC TV coverage and then to a series of articles in the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;. The &quot;Post&quot; was owned by Rupert Murdoch, and Dinh&#x27;s articles there were credited with helping free his sister. The personal ties to Murdoch&#x27;s interests and family were debated as Dinh took the role in the phone-hacking investigation.

Dinh was mentioned as a potential nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States in a Republican administration.

===Department of Justice===
Dinh served as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice from 2001 to 2003, under the presidency of George W. Bush. He was confirmed in the Senate by a vote of 96 to 1, with the sole No vote coming from Hillary Clinton. As the official responsible for federal legal policy, Dinh worked with issues of illicit drugs, racial profiling in federal law enforcement, exploitation of children, human trafficking, DNA technology, gun violence, and civil and criminal justice procedural reform. Dinh was also involved in the selection and confirmation of 100 district and 23 appellate judges in his role representing the U.S. Department of Justice. After 9/11, Dinh conducted a comprehensive review of DOJ priorities, policies, and practices, and played a key role in developing the USA PATRIOT Act and revising the Attorney General&#x27;s Guidelines, which govern federal law enforcement activities and national security investigations.

===Georgetown University Law Center===
Dinh has been a Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center. His expertise lies in constitutional law, corporations law, and the law and economics of development. He was also currently the Co-Director of the Asian Law &amp; Policy Studies Program. He previously served as Co-Director of the Joint Program in Law and Business Administration, from 1998 to 1999.

=== Fox Corporation ===
In September 2018, Dinh was appointed as Chief Legal and Policy Officer of Fox Corporation and would report directly to CEO Lachlan Murdoch. Dinh is responsible for all legal, compliance, and regulatory matters, as well as oversight of government and public affairs.

In April 2020, it was announced that Dinh and a handful of other Fox Corp. executives would forgo their salaries for six months as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On August 11, 2023, Fox announced that Dinh would be leaving the company&#x27;s employ and become an outside advisor.

==Personal life==
His family was separated in 1975 when his father, Phong Dinh, was being held as a political prisoner in the family&#x27;s war-ravaged homeland after the fall of Saigon. He escaped in 1978, and remained a fugitive in Vietnam, when his mother, Nga Thu Nguyễn, and his older siblings got on a boat with 85 other people and set out. For 12 days Dinh was in a broken 15-foot-long boat, at one point with no food or water. They encountered a Thai fishing crew that gave them food and gas, and helped fix the boat and pointed them toward land. When they reached Malaysia they were met by gunshots from a patrol boat; the Malaysians did not want them. Their boat docked but Dinh&#x27;s mother realized that the port police would force them to leave the next morning, so she sneaked back out to the boat alone that night with an axe and damaged the boat so as not to be sent back on it. After six months as refugees in Malaysia, Dinh&#x27;s family arrived at Oregon in November 1978. They picked strawberries for menial wages, sending money back to Dinh&#x27;s father and a sibling hiding out in Vietnam. After Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980, the crop damage forced his family to relocate to Fullerton.

Dinh was honored by his high school alma mater when he was added to Fullerton&#x27;s wall of fame. He will share that wall with an ideological opposite, David Boies, former Vice President Al Gore&#x27;s lawyer for the Florida recount.

Dinh was reunited with his father in 1982. In 1992, he was reunited with one of his sisters at a refugee camp in Hong Kong, a meeting filmed by the newsmagazine show &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;.

Dinh lives in Los Angeles, California, with his wife, Jennifer Ashworth Dinh, and their three sons.

<doc id="447059" wikidata="Q278505" url="?curid=447059" title="Bertrand Clauzel">
<text>Bertrand, Comte Clauzel (; 12 December 1772 – 21 April 1842) was a French soldier who served in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. He saw service in the Low Countries, Italy, Haiti and Spain, where he achieved short periods of independent command. 

Clauzel spent 1815-1820 in exile in the United States, before returning to France and becoming politically active in the republican and liberal opposition to the absolutist governments of Charles X.

Clauzel would latter became a Marshal of France under the Orléans monarchy following the July Revolution and served during the French conquest of Algeria, first during the initial French expedition and later as Governor. Napoleon listed Clauzel amongst his most skilful generals.

== Early life ==
Bertrand Clauzel was born on 12 December 1772 in Mirepoix, in the County of Foix. 

Bertrand&#x27;s father Gabriel Clauzel, was bankrupt wholesale merchant who had been disinherited by his own father. Gabriel embraced the revolution was on the committee of surveillance of Mirepoix, where a deputy to the National Convention would latter write that “his presence alone frightens the enemies of the new regime.”.

Bertrand joined the Mirepoix National Guard at the end of July 1789, the Guard was deployed by his father Gabriel to invest the episcopal palace of Mirepoix and harass the bishop in 1790. 

== Military career 1791-1809 ==

=== Early military career 1791–1809 ===
Clauzel enlisted in the 43rd Infantry as one of the volunteers of 1791. He saw service in the first campaign of the French Revolutionary Wars. Having distinguished himself repeatedly on the northern frontier (1792–1793) and in the eastern Pyrénées (1793–1794), Clauzel was made a chef de battalion and given the honour of bringing four flags taken from the Spanish back to Paris to present to the National Convention.

In 1798. Clauzel became the chief of staff to General Emmanuel de Grouchy, in which role he negotiated the abdication of the King of Sardinia in December 1798. In 1799, Clauzel as he was promoted to général de brigade. In this rank, he served in Italy, during which he won great distinction at the battles of Trebbia and the Novi. Clauzel took command of the 4th Division under General Louis-Gabriel Suchet in 1800 and during the campaign that spring he seized the redoubt of Melogno and participated in the attack on Monte-San-Giacomo. Months later in December he fought at Pozzolo.
The peace of Amiens enabled Napoleon to organise the LeClerc expedition to reassert French control in the lucrative colony of Saint-Domingue following the Haitian revolution. Clauzel seized Fort-Dauphin in December 1802 and became commander at Cap Français with a promotion to Divisional General. General Charles LeClerc died of yellow fever in 1803 and under the command of LeClerc&#x27;s successor Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau Clauzel became disillusioned with Rochambeau&#x27;s use of extreme violence and indiscriminate killing in an attempt to reassert French control. Clauzel worked with General Thouvenot at first to try and influence Rochambeau before they eventually conspired on a plot to overthrow Rochambeau and exile him. Rochambeau learned of the plot and in September 1803 ordered both Clauzel and Thouvenot arrested and deported. The frigate &quot;La&quot; &quot;Surveillante&quot; carrying Clauzel was shipwrecked off the coast of Florida. He survived the wreck and made his way to New York where he obtained passage to France.

After his return to France, he was in almost continuous service in a number of coastal garrisons until 1806 when he was sent to the army of Naples. Soon after, Napoleon made him a Grand Officer of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. In 1808–1809, he was under the command of Marshal Auguste de Marmont in Dalmatia, and at the close of 1809 Clauzel was assigned to the Army of Portugal under Marshal André Masséna.

== The peninsular war 1809-1814 ==
Clauzel commanded a division in the Army of Portugal during the Peninsular War, including the Torres Vedras campaign. Masséna&#x27;s failures saw him replaced by Marmont, under whom Clauzel worked to re-established the discipline, efficiency, and mobility of the army, which had suffered severely in the retreat from Torres Vedras.

=== Salamanca: &quot;a grand attempt to retrieve the battle&quot; ===

In 1812 the French concentrated their forces to besiege Valencia and withdrew other units in preparation for the invasion of Russia. This left other theatres stripped of troops, Wellington having previously secured key fortresses at the Spanish Portuguese border opted to attack threatening the northern road connecting Madrid to Burgos and then France.

Marmot initially retreated in the face of Wellingtons superior forces but once reinforced he attempted to force the Anglo-Portuguese army to retreat. Mormont attempted this by marching to turn Wellington&#x27;s flank and threaten its lines of communication back to Portugal it was these manoeuvres that instigated the Battle of Salamanca. 

As the battle began Clauzel&#x27;s division was initially positioned behind the French left wing. After the rout of Jean Guillaume Barthélemy Thomières&#x27;s division, it advanced to reinforce the faltering line. With both Marshal Marmont and General Jean Pierre François Bonet wounded, Clauzel, as the most senior officer available assumed command of the French forces under challenging circumstances. Marmont&#x27;s attempt to flank had exposed the divisions led by Thomières and Antoine Louis Popon de Maucune to an Anglo-Portuguese assault. According to Lewis Butler, Clauzel&#x27;s subsequent actions constituted &quot;a grand attempt to retrieve the battle&quot;.

The battlefield was characterized by two small hills, the lesser and the greater Arapiles. The lesser Arapile was situated at the heart of the Anglo-Portuguese army&#x27;s position, while the greater Arapile occupied a central position in the French army&#x27;s deployment. Both hills served as crucial points, securing the flanks of each army&#x27;s formations. Clauzel&#x27;s strategy aimed to counter the attack on his left flank by launching an assault on the Anglo-Portuguese centre to capture the lesser Arapile.

The offensive proved unsuccessful as it was met with staunch resistance from fresh enemy troops, resulting in disarray among the French forces and leaving them vulnerable to subsequent assaults on their left and centre. The battle culminated in a resounding defeat for the French, with Butler noting that the engagements had rendered the divisions of Maucune, Thomières, and Clauzel incapable of functioning as cohesive military units.

=== The Castile Campaign ===
The retreat from Salamanca posed significant challenges to Clauzel due to the substantial losses suffered by the French army. Initially, Maximilien Sébastien Foy&#x27;s division, the only French unit relatively unscathed, provided cover as the rear guard. However, it suffered a decisive defeat the following day at the Battle of García Hernández.

Clauzel managed to salvage what remained of the Army of Portugal as he retreated north of Burgos. Burgos was besieged by Wellington before he could regroup his forces. With reinforcement from General Joseph Souham, Clauzel spent some time recovering from wounds sustained before resuming divisional command in the subsequent campaign which saw Wellington&#x27;s retreat to back to Ciudad Rodrigo. Despite Wellington&#x27;s return to his initial position, Clauzel&#x27;s costly defeat at Salamanca compelled French forces in Spain to focus their efforts against Wellington, leading to the liberation of Andalusia, Extremadura, and Asturias by Spanish forces.

=== The rest of the War of the Sixth Coalition ===
In early 1813, Clauzel assumed command of the Army of the North in Spain. During the Battle of Vitoria, he was a day&#x27;s march away and unable to aid Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, contributing to latter&#x27;s defeat. In the days after Vitoria his army was separated from Jourdan&#x27;s retreating army and risked being cut off, but Clauzel conducted a skilful retreat though Jaca to concentrate French forces.

After Jourdan was replaced Clauzel would continue service under the command of Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult, he continued to serve throughout the rest of the Peninsular War and the 1814 campaign in south-west France, seeing action at the major battles of Nivelle, Orthez and Toulouse as well as personally securing a minor French victory at Aire. 

== A tumultuous political life ==

=== Changing loyalties ===
Following the Bourbon restoration in 1814, he reluctantly submitted to the restored monarchy but swiftly joined Napoleon upon his return to France. Throughout the Hundred Days, he held command along the Pyrenees. While there were no major battles on this front before Napoleon surrendered, Clauzel did manage to gain the particular ire of French royalists with his actions in chasing the Duchess of Angoulême out of Bordeaux.

=== Exile in the United States ===
Clauzel was listed as among those who had &quot;attacked the person&quot; of the King by their participation in the Hundred days in the edict of July 24, 1815. Clauzel left Bordeaux and escaped police detection as he fled through France aided by anonymous letters sent to police which reported his whereabouts to be in the region of Foix where he had grown up. Exiled initially in Belgium, he understood the great legal danger he was in and set off for the United States arriving in Brooklyn on August 29, 1815. 

Clauzel&#x27;s fears were justified and he would later be condemned to death in absentia. In the America&#x27;s French societies of exiles organised attempts to purchase land in various countries, not all of them with entirely peaceful and commercial intentions. The restored Bourbons worried that Clauzel amongst other exiles such as Joseph Bonaparte and Grouchy were assembling Napoleonic loyalists in the Americas with a view to free Napoleon from exile in St Helena through the hiring of American Privateers. Once free, a range of ambitious schemes were dreamt up for Napoleon to join in various Spanish American independence wars to create a new empire. Clauzel was not directly implicated in such schemes but in one case an expedition organised by Lakanal but did have letters addressed to him.

Clauzel was amongst those who settled in the Vine and Olive Colony in modern day Alabama. He was known to tend a vegetable garden and sell produce at the local market, during his time in exile Clauzel was a personal friend of former General Grouchy.

=== Return to France ===
Clauzel seized the first opportunity to return and assist the Orléanist Liberals in France when he was pardoned in 1820, serving in the Chamber of Deputies for Ariège in 1827, then for Ardennes in 1830. 

He sat on the left and voted for the Address of the 221 which expressed disapproval at the ultra-royalist administration. Following the July Revolution of 1830, he promptly assumed a military command being appointed the commander of French forces in Algeria.

=== General in Algeria ===

The invasion of Algiers had been began by the government of the Bourbon absolutist King Charles in a late measure to shore up popular support for his rule, but with the July revolution the new constitutional monarchy was governed by liberals who had opposed the Algiers expedition. Victory by French forces at the Battle of Staouéli and the fall of Algiers did not save the absolutist government however French success was publicly popular and the new government was careful to not turn public opinion against itself by abandoning Algeria. The political imperative in Paris was to secure both the loyalty of the troops in Algeria, and begrudgingly the conquest albeit with a reduced size to the expedition. Clauzel was sent to replace Legitimist General Louis-Auguste-Victor de Bourmont as commander in chief of the invasion of Algeria. 

Under Bourmount, French forces had seized the ports of Oran and Bône but abandoned them on hearing of the overthrow of Charles X in France. Bourmount even intended to lead his troops back to France to restore the Bourbons but, with little support from the rank and file, he opted instead to go into exile in Spain. Clauzel therefore inherited a situation in flux, many units needed new (politically loyal) officers and the size of the expedition was reduced by 50%. Nevertheless, Clauzel oversaw the re-occupation of Oran and Bône but was unable to secure the Algerian interior.

As a veteran of the war in Spain, characterised by insurgency and resistance, given the numerous grievances of Algerians against Ottoman rule, Clauzel attempted to steer French policy away from the likelihood of a protracted engagement. Clauzel&#x27;s approach involved a political settlement between the French, who would take over as suzerain over the Husaynid rulers of Tunis who would gain control over much of Algeria beyond some major ports. In a system similar to that of the status of Algiers under the Ottoman Empire, but with France as overlord. Clauzel&#x27;s attempts collapsed, his actions lacking sanction from his superiors in Paris. The arrival of a 500-strong Tunisian contingent led to unrest in Algerian cities and, having lost support, he was replaced. 

Clauzel acted in the absence of orders from the War Ministry and while debates were live in parliament about what to do with the territories in North Africa, he did set out a clearly defined goal for France in Algeria that matched the military forces available to him given the limited political will in the early 1830s for a large and expensive commitment of troops. The invocation of the Tunisians failed to account for simmering tensions emanating in Algerian society that had been present before the French arrived and were manifested in the unrest that accompanied their arrival.

Elsewhere, Clauzel was an enthusiastic supporter of the first attempt at agricultural colonialism in Algeria, especially a model farm in the Mitidja. Clauzel would also set up a company to acquire agricultural land and enable settlement by Europeans.

=== Political life 1831-35 ===
Simultaneous with his removal, Clauzel was appointed a Marshal of France in February 1831. In his absence Algeria saw a small revolving door of successors to Clauzel as Governor General, combined with vacillation in France caused &#x27;restricted occupation&#x27; in Algeria to become the French goal, due to, in the words of Charles-André Julien, &quot;less a matter of policy than of an absence of policy&quot;. 

For nearly four years thereafter, he advocated on behalf of Algerian colonists to the Chamber of Deputies, and defended his actions while in military command in Algeria. He advocated for continued occupation, arguing that France&#x27;s &quot;national honour would be tainted&quot; by withdrawal, not only on account of such an event but also because he believed that France&#x27;s withdrawal would lead to the massacre of the Jewish population of Algeria.

Clauzel wrote and advised the national assembly and the government on what policy France should take to secure her interests now that the occupation had become permanent, as well as providing information about the physical and human geography of Algeria. Amongst these suggestions was support to allow Jews to hold positions in local governance and the judiciary, which they had not done under the Deylical rule. 

Drawing on his own experiences farming in Alabama Clauzel publicised Algeria as a &quot;Mediterranean Alabama&quot; - suggesting that the climate would be suitable for the cultivation of cotton, sugar, and other colonial produce that France would otherwise have to import.

=== 2nd term as Governor general in Algeria ===
By summer 1835, an uneasy truce had broken down and hostilities between France and Abd al-Qadir had erupted as Makhzen tribes from around Oran sought French protection. On June 28, a French column was surprised between the low hills around Maqta. The disastrous Battle of Maqta provoked popular outrage in France and the then Governor, General Trèzel, was replaced by Clauzel, who once again returned to North Africa. Despite early successes, such as at the Battle of Habra and the capture of Mascara, both in December 1835, and then Tlemcen in January 1836. These victories were however spoiled as Clauzel struggled to strike a decisive blow against Abd al-Qadir and by political missteps, such as his imposition of a massive indemnity upon Tlemcen, thereby failing to turn his conquests into allies. The French presence in the Algerian hinterland remained extremely limited.In the western theatre of Algeria, it took until the summer of 1836 for the French to force a decisive battle against Al-Qadir&#x27;s forces, at the Sikkak river, where a ten thousand-strong contingent of regulars and tribal warriors was routed by General Thomas-Robert Bugeaud.
In the east, Clauzel mustered forces to strike at the Beylik of Constantine. However, weather and determined resistance from Ahmad Bey saw the 1836 attempt to seize Constantine fail. Public and political opinion turned on Clauzel, leading to his recall in February 1837. With French policy shifting to a policy of &#x27;restricted, progressive and peaceful&#x27; occupation, such a policy entailed making peace with Abd al-Qadir&#x27;s sovereignty, with the Treaty of Tafna, so they could concentrate forces to avenge Clauzel&#x27;s defeat. Clauzel&#x27;s successor was General Charles Marie Denys de Damrémont who would die during the successful siege of Constantine later in 1837.
=== Retirement and legacy ===
Upon his return to France, he retired from active service, vigorously defending his actions before the deputies before withdrawing from public life. Historian James McDougall argues in his &quot;History of Algeria&quot; that General Bugeaud&#x27;s actions to conclude a treaty subsequent to Clauzel&#x27;s removal with Abd al-Qadir were short-sighted and only gave a defeated enemy time to regroup while extracting meaningless concessions. Other assessments note the lack of political support in France which limited the success of Clauzel&#x27;s actions in Algeria.

He lived in retirement until his death from apoplexy at Château du Secourieu in Haute-Garonne in 1842.

Clauzel&#x27;s name is one of 660 French generals whose names are inscribed on the Arc de Triumphe, his name appearing at the top of column 34 on the west side. When asked on Saint Helena which of his generals was the most skilful, Napoleon named Clauzel along with Marshal Suchet and General Étienne Maurice Gérard.
