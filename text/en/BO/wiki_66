<text>The McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender is an American tanker and cargo aircraft that was operated by the United States Air Force (USAF) from 1981 to 2024. A military version of the three-engine DC-10 airliner, the KC-10 was developed from the Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program. It incorporates military-specific equipment for its primary roles of aerial refueling and transport. It was developed to supplement the KC-135 Stratotanker following experiences in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. The KC-10 was the second McDonnell Douglas transport aircraft to be selected by the Air Force following the C-9. A total of 60 KC-10s were produced for the USAF. The Royal Netherlands Air Force operated two similar tankers designated &quot;KDC-10&quot; that were converted from DC-10s.

The KC-10 played a key role in the mobilization of US military assets, taking part in overseas operations far from home. These aircraft performed airlift and aerial refueling during the 1986 bombing of Libya (Operation Eldorado Canyon), the 1990–91 Gulf War with Iraq (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm), the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia (Operation Allied Force), War in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom), and Iraq War (Operations Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn).

==Design and development==
===Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program===
During the Vietnam War, doubts began to form regarding the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker fleet&#x27;s ability to meet the needs of the United States&#x27; global commitments. The aerial refueling fleet was deployed to Southeast Asia to support tactical aircraft and strategic bombers, while maintaining the U.S.-based support of the nuclear-bomber fleet. Consequently, the Air Force sought an aerial tanker with greater capabilities than the KC-135. In 1972, two DC-10s were flown in trials at Edwards Air Force Base, simulating air refuelings to check for possible wake issues. Boeing performed similar tests with a 747.

During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the Air Force commenced Operation Nickel Grass to supply Israel with weapons and supplies. The operation demonstrated the necessity for adequate air-refueling capabilities; denied landing rights in Europe, C-5 Galaxy transports were forced to carry a fraction of their maximum payload on direct flights from the continental United States to Israel. To address this shortfall in mobility, in 1975, under the &quot;Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program&quot;, four aircraft were evaluated—the Lockheed C-5, the Boeing 747, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and the Lockheed L-1011. The only serious contenders were Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. In December 1977, McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s DC-10 was chosen. The primary reason for this choice was the KC-10&#x27;s ability to operate from shorter runways. Initially, a batch of 12 aircraft was ordered, but this was later increased to 60.

===KC-10 Extender===
The KC-10 Extender first flew in July 1980. In October 1980 the first aerial refuel sortie was performed. The design for the KC-10 involved modifications from the DC-10-30CF design. Unnecessary airline features were replaced by an improved cargo-handling system and military avionics. The KC-10 retained an 88% commonality with its commercial counterparts, giving it greater access to the worldwide commercial support system. Other changes from the DC-10-30CF include the removal of most windows and lower cargo doors. Early aircraft featured a distinctive light gray, white and blue paint scheme, and a gray-green camouflage scheme was used on later tankers. The paint scheme was switched to a medium gray color by the late 1990s.
The most notable changes were the addition of the McDonnell Douglas Advanced Aerial Refueling Boom and additional fuel tanks located in the baggage compartments below the main deck. The extra tanks increase the KC-10&#x27;s fuel capacity to 356,000 lb (161,478 kg), nearly doubling the KC-135&#x27;s capacity. The KC-10 has both a centerline refueling boom—unique in that it sports a control surface system at its aft end that differs from the V-tail design used on previous tankers—and a drogue-and-hose system on the starboard side of the rear fuselage. The KC-10 boom operator cockpit is seated in the rear of the aircraft with a wide window for monitoring refueling rather than prone as in the KC-135. The operator controls refueling operations through a digital fly-by wire system. The refueling boom can deliver fuel to a receiver at the maximum rate of 1,100 gallons (4,180 liters) per minute, while the centerline drogue system has a maximum fuel offload rate of 470 gallons (1,786 liters) per minute.
Unlike the KC-135, the KC-10&#x27;s hose-and-drogue system allows refueling of Navy, Marine Corps, and most allied aircraft, all in one mission. The final twenty KC-10s produced included wing-mounted pods for added refueling locations. The KC-10 can carry a complement of 75 personnel with 146,000 lb (66,225 kg) of cargo, or 170,000 lb (77,110 kg) in an all-cargo configuration. With that, it can transport those weights for an unrefueled range of 4,400 miles (7,040 km). The KC-10 has a side cargo door for loading and unloading cargo. Handling equipment is required to raise and lower loads to the cargo opening. It can carry cargo and serve as a tanker on overseas missions.

===Further developments===
A need for new transport aircraft for the Royal Netherlands Air Force (&quot;Koninklijke Luchtmacht&quot;) was first identified in 1984. The 1991 Gulf War highlighted the deficiencies in mobility of European forces. In 1991, four categories of transport requirements were established. Category A required a large cargo aircraft with a range of at least 4,500 km and the capability to refuel F-16s. In 1992, two DC-10-30CFs were acquired from Martinair in a buy/leaseback contract. When one of the two aircraft was lost in the Martinair Flight 495 crash, a third aircraft was bought from Martinair.

The conversion was handled via the United States foreign military sales program, which contracted McDonnell Douglas. Costs for the conversion were initially estimated at $89.5 million (FY 1994). The aircraft were to be equipped with both a boom and a probe and drogue system. Because McDonnell Douglas did not have any experience with the requested Remote Aerial Refueling Operator (RARO) system, and because the third aircraft differed from the original two, the program could not be completed at budget. By omitting the probe and drogue system and a fixed partition wall between the cargo and passenger, the cost could be limited at $96 million.

To make up for the cost increase McDonnell Douglas hired Dutch companies to do part of the work. The conversion of the aircraft was performed by KLM and was done from October 1994 to September 1995 for the first aircraft and from February to December 1995 for the second. This was much longer than planned, mostly because McDonnell Douglas delivered the parts late. This would have again increased the cost, but in the contract for the AH-64 Apaches which the Royal Netherlands Air Force also bought from McDonnell Douglas, the price was agreed to be kept at $96 million.

In 2010, the USAF awarded a contract to Boeing to upgrade the fleet of 59 aircraft with new Communication, navigation and surveillance and air traffic management (CNS/ATM) system. This was to allow the aircraft to fly in civil airspace as new ICAO and FAA standards took effect in 2015. Rockwell Collins was awarded a contract in 2011 for avionics and systems integration for the cockpit modernization program.

==Operational history==
===United States===
The first KC-10 was delivered to the Air Force&#x27;s Strategic Air Command (SAC) in March 1981 at Barksdale AFB. In 1982 a newly renamed 22d Air Refueling Wing, formerly the 22d Bombardment Wing, was re-equipped with KC-10A Extenders and became the second Air Force unit to operate the new tankers. The 60th and final KC-10 was delivered on 29 November 1988. The KC-10s served with SAC until 1992, when they were reassigned to the newly established Air Mobility Command. In the aerial refueling role, the KC-10s have been operated largely in the strategic refueling of large number of tactical aircraft on ferry flights and the refueling of other strategic transport aircraft. Conversely, the KC-135 fleet has operated largely in the in-theater tactical role. There are 59 KC-10 Extenders in service with the USAF as of 2010. The USAF&#x27;s KC-10s are stationed primarily at Travis AFB, California, and McGuire AFB, now part of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, in New Jersey.
When faced with refusals of basing and overflight rights from continental European countries during Operation El Dorado Canyon, the U.S. was forced to use the UK-based F-111s in the 1986 air-strikes against Libya. The KC-10s and KC-135s allowed 29 F-111s, along with other Air Force and Navy aircraft, to reach their targets. The KC-10 again played a key role during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1991. KC-10s facilitated the deployment of tactical, strategic, and transport aircraft to Saudi Arabia. In the early stages of Operation Desert Shield, aerial refueling was key to the rapid airlift of materiel and forces. In addition to refueling airlift aircraft, the KC-10, along with the smaller KC-135, moved thousands of tons of cargo and thousands of troops in support of the massive buildup. The KC-10 and the KC-135 conducted about 51,700 separate refueling operations and delivered 125 million gallons (475 million liters) of fuel without missing a single scheduled rendezvous.
Since then, the KC-10 had participated in other smaller conflicts. In March 1999, NATO launched Operation Allied Force against the government of Yugoslavia. The mobility portion of the operation began in February and was heavily dependent on tankers. By early May 1999, some 150 KC-10s and KC-135s deployed to Europe where they refueled bombers, fighters and support aircraft engaged in the conflict. The KC-10 flew 409 missions throughout the entire Allied Force campaign and continued support operations in Kosovo. Since 11 September 2001, KC-10s had flown more than 350 missions guarding U.S. skies as a part of Operation Noble Eagle. During Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, KC-10s flew more than 1,390 missions delivering critical air refueling support to numerous joint and Coalition receiver aircraft. As of 2004, KC-10s were expected to serve until 2043.

The Air Force considered retiring its fleet of KC-10 tankers in response to sequestration budget cuts as part of the service&#x27;s FY 2015 budget. A &quot;vertical chop&quot; to divest all KC-10s was suggested because there are fewer KC-10s than KC-135s, having three different tanker models in service after the introduction of the KC-46 would be costly, and a &quot;horizontal cut&quot; across the refueling fleets would achieve small efficiencies. Some believed retiring the KC-10 would not benefit the Air Force, given that it is equipped with both boom and hose-and-drogue refueling systems and the fleet&#x27;s relatively young age.
At first, officials claimed that the initial focus on retiring the KC-10 in September 2013 was a &quot;trial balloon&quot; to call attention to Air Force operating cost issues. As of early 2013, the KC-10 had a per hour flying cost of $21,170 and a mission capable rate of 87 percent. A FY 2015 budget plan did not include cuts to the KC-10. In July 2020, the first US KC-10 to be retired, tail number 86-0036, was transferred to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) for storage at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona.

In July 2021, the 2d ARS was the first KC-10 squadron to start conversion to the KC-46. In August 2021, the KC-10 took part in the largest non-combatant evacuation in support of Operation Allies refuge and contributing to the safe evacuation of more than 124,000 Afghan refugees.

In January 2023, the USAF announced that all KC-10s are to be retired by 30 September 2024. The KC-10 flew its last combat sortie for the USAF on 5 October 2023. On 26 September 2024, the KC-10 flew its final sortie on tail number 79-1948 bound for the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona.

===Netherlands===
The two Dutch KDC-10s were used for both refueling and transport. They were stationed on Eindhoven Airport as part of the 334th Transport Squadron. Of the 5,500 hours flown in the first three years of use, the aircraft were used in their tanker role for 50% of the time. Besides being used by the air force and NATO allies, the KDC-10s were also used to support peacekeeping and humanitarian aid operations. Of the first three years, 32% of the flight hours were used for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid.
In this function, the aircraft was deployed to Kosovo to evacuate refugees, to the Caribbean and Central America to provide humanitarian aid after the hurricanes Luis, Georges and Mitch and to various countries in Africa and Asia to provide development aid. In 1998, the aircraft were used to evacuate Dutch citizens from Indonesia during the Fall of Suharto. Dutch KDC-10s operated out of Manas AFB in support of allied forces during Operation Enduring Freedom and in support of Allied Air Force over Iraq and Syria.

A third DC-10, registered T-255 was acquired and served for three years before being withdrawn from service in April 2014 due to Dutch defense cuts and flown to Newquay Airport for scrapping. The KDC-10s in Dutch service were replaced with the Airbus A330 MRTT. The first aircraft, registered T-264/&#x27;Prins Bernhard&#x27; and due for a major service, was withdrawn from use in November 2019, prior to being transferred to its new owner, Omega Aerial Refueling Services. The last KDC-10, registered T-235/&#x27;Jan Scheffer&#x27; remained in Dutch service until October 2021. The aircraft left The Netherlands bound for service with Omega in the U.S. in October 2021.

===Civilian operators===
Commercial refueling companies Omega Aerial Refueling Services and Global Airtanker Service operate three KDC-10 tankers, N974VV, N235UL and N264DE, for lease. They were converted from DC-10s and provide probe and drogue refueling capabilities from wing pods similar to the KC-10.

In June and July 2011, Omega Air&#x27;s KDC-10 supported three Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s F/A-18 Hornets, en route to Red Flag – Alaska.

In 2019, Omega agreed to purchase the Netherlands&#x27; two KDC-10s. One was received in November 2019, and the second delivered in October 2021.

==Variants==
*KC-10A: Initial military tanker version based on the DC-10-30CF.
*KDC-10: Conversion of DC-10-30CF aircraft to tanker/transport configuration. While a FMS program run through McDonnell Douglas, conversion of two aircraft was carried out by KLM. Omega Aerial Refueling Services now operates both former RNAF KDC-10-30 aircraft and 1 KDC-10-40.
*KC-10B: After McDonnell Douglas did the KDC-10 conversion for the Royal Netherlands Air Force in 1992, they proposed a tanker/transport version of the MD-11CF which had the in-house designation KMD-11. MDC offered either conversion of second hand aircraft (KMD-11) or new build aircraft (KC-10B), the proposed KMD-11 offered 35,000 lb more cargo capacity and 8,400 lb more transferable fuel than the KC-10A. It was offered to the RNAF and Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) in the 1990s and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in the early 2000s.

<text>Pierre-Paul Riquet, Baron de Bonrepos (; 29 June 1609 (some sources say 1604) – 4 October 1680) was the engineer and canal-builder responsible for the construction of the Canal du Midi.

==Early life==
Born as Paul Riquet in Béziers, Hérault, France, he was the eldest son of solicitor, state prosecutor and businessman François-Guillaume Riquet. As a youth, Riquet was only interested in mathematics and science.

==Career==
As a &quot;fermier général&quot; (&quot;farmer-general&quot;) of Languedoc-Roussillon, he was a tax farmer responsible for the collection and administration of the gabelle (salt tax) in Languedoc. He was appointed collector in 1630, and was also a munitions provider to the Catalan Army. Riquet became wealthy and was given permission by the King to levy his own taxes. This gave him greater wealth, which allowed him to execute grand projects with technical expertise.

In 1651, he bought the Château de Bonrepos, next to Verfeil in the northeast of Toulouse.

===The Canal du Midi===
Riquet is the man responsible for building the 240-kilometre-long artificial waterway that links the southern coast of France to Toulouse to link to the canal/river system that ran across to the Bay of Biscay, one of the great engineering feats of the 17th century. The logistics were immense and complex, so much so that other engineers including the ancient Romans had discussed the idea but not proceeded with it. Even so, Louis XIV was keen for the project to proceed, largely because of the increasing cost and danger of transporting cargo and trade around southern Spain where pirates were common.

Planning, financing, and construction of the Canal du Midi completely absorbed Riquet from 1665 forward. Numerous problems occurred, including navigating around many hills and providing a system that would feed the canal with water through the dry summer months. Advances in lock engineering and the creation of a 6 million cubic metre artificial lake, the Bassin de St. Ferréol which harvested water from streams on the Black Mountain near the Naurouze watershed, provided solutions. In 1668, the King placed the canal seigneury up for auction. That is when Riquet acquired ownership and as such, became &quot;Lord of the Canal du Midi.&quot;

The high cost of construction depleted Riquet&#x27;s personal fortune and the seemingly insurmountable problems caused his sponsors, including Louis XIV, to lose interest. Riquet&#x27;s major engineering achievements included the Fonseranes Lock Staircase and the Malpas Tunnel, the world&#x27;s first navigable canal tunnel. The canal was completed in 1681, eight months after Riquet&#x27;s death.

For his achievements, he was created Baron of Bonrepos by King Louis XIV on 20 November 1666. Riquet acquired the seigneury of Caraman for his second son, Pierre-Paul II, and bought him a Brevet Lieutenant General of the Kings Armies in the French Guards. As Pierre-Paul II died without issue, he made his late brother&#x27;s eldest son, Victor François de Riquet de Caraman (1698–1760), his heir in 1722.

==Personal life==

Around 1637, Riquet married Catherine de Milhau at age 19. Together, they were the parents of seven children, five of whom survived to adulthood, two boys and three girls, including:

* Jean-Mathias de Riquet (1638–1714), who married Marie Madeleine de Broglie, daughter of Victor-Maurice, comte de Broglie. After her death in 1699, he married Marie Louise de Montaigne, a daughter of Nicolas de Montaigne.
* Élisabeth de Riquet (b. 1645)
* Pierre-Paul II Riquet (1646–1730), who acquired the County of Caraman in 1670; he died unmarried.
* Marie de Riquet (1648–1686)
* Catherine de Riquet (1652–1719), who married Jacques de Barthélémy de Gramont Lanta.
* Anne de Riquet (1653–1720)

The Baron died on 4 October 1680. He is buried in the Cathedral Saint-Etienne in Toulouse.

<text>The Fulton Fish Market is a fish market in Hunts Point, a section of the New York City borough of the Bronx, in New York, United States. It was originally a wing of the Fulton Market, established in 1822 to sell a variety of foodstuffs and produce. In November 2005, the Fish Market relocated to a new facility in Hunts Point in the Bronx, from its historic location near the Brooklyn Bridge along the East River waterfront at and above Fulton Street in the Financial District, Lower Manhattan.

During much of its 183-year tenure at the original site, the Fulton Fish Market was the most important wholesale East Coast fish market in the United States. Opened in 1822, it was the destination of fishing boats from across the Atlantic Ocean. By the 1950s, most of the Market&#x27;s fish were trucked in rather than offloaded from the docks. The wholesalers at the Market then sold it to restaurateurs and retailers who purchased fresh fish of every imaginable variety.

Prices at the Fulton Fish Market were tracked and reported by the United States government. In its original location, it was one of the last, and most significant, of the great wholesale food markets of New York. It survived major fires in 1835, 1845, 1918, and 1995. In its new location in Hunts Point, the Fulton Fish Market Cooperative handles millions of pounds of seafood daily, with annual sales exceeding $1 billion, and is second in size only to Tokyo&#x27;s Toyosu Market.

==History==

===Nineteenth century===

The Fulton Fish Market was one of New York&#x27;s earliest open-air fish markets. From a New York newspaper dated 1831:

The Fulton Fish Market initially served primarily housekeepers from the surrounding areas and Brooklyn. However, by 1850, wholesalers had become the main buyers as the market gained in prominence. The Fulton Fish Market is one of the oldest fish markets in the United States, along with the older Maine Avenue Fish Market in Washington, D.C. The Fulton Market was claimed to be the oldest in continuous operation in one place (since 1822) until it was relocated in 2005. The Maine Avenue Market in D.C. (since 1805, in various incarnations) is now considered the oldest continuously operating open-air market that still survives on the East Coast. However, the Fulton Fish Market is the oldest institution that still retains a primarily wholesale function; although its original public market on South Street is now closed.

===Organized crime ===
During most of the 20th century the market was associated with one or more New York Mafia families. In 1988, the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office filed a suit under federal racketeering laws to appoint a trustee to run the market. A trustee was appointed, but the extent to which he was able to limit organized crime influence was limited. Since 2001, the market has been regulated by the City of New York&#x27;s Business Integrity Commission in an effort to eliminate organized crime influence.

===New Bronx facility ===

On November 14, 2005, nearly four years after construction on the $85 million facility began, the Market opened at its Bronx location. 
The move had been delayed due to legal problems.
The last-minute dispute was between a company which had had a ten-year monopoly on delivering fish from trucks to individual sellers&#x27; stalls, versus the cooperative of sellers who wanted to do the task themselves in the new building. When the feuding parties agreed to continue as they had been for another three years, the last obstacle to the move was removed and packing began.

The move from the historic Manhattan site was due to a number of factors:
* cramped location
* lack of modern amenities, such as climate control
* increasing real estate value of Manhattan site for retail and residential use
* redevelopment pressure due to desirable proximity to the South Street Seaport and the Fulton Street/East River area

The move brought 650 workers from the market&#x27;s former location into the Bronx, with an additional 5,500 diesel truck trips through Hunts Point per week (according to the NY Metropolitan Transportation Council) – bringing the weekly total to 60,000. 
The facility generates over $1 billion in yearly revenue, and allows seafood distributors to store their goods in temperature controlled warehouses with easier transportation access due to its proximity to the Bruckner Expressway. The facility has better access to major highways in Hunts Point, but does not utilize the nearby LaGuardia Airport in Queens.

In 2012, the market handled of fish annually, at an estimated value of $1 billion.

==Academic research==
The Fulton Fish Market has been of interest to economists as a case study in imperfect competition, despite being a highly centralized market with a large number of well-informed buyers and sellers. Using 1992 data, Kathryn Graddy (1995, 2006) found that third-degree price discrimination arose in the Fulton market. In particular, Asian customers, who were generally more price elastic, were quoted lower prices than white buyers, by 6.3 cents on average. Graddy (1995, 2006) attributes this to the different markets served by Asian and white buyers. Asian buyers were more likely to resell fish whole to retail and fry shops in poorer neighbourhoods, or sell to establishments in Chinatown where the restaurant sector was highly competitive. They therefore had less scope to pass on prices to their customers than white buyers, who were more likely to resell to less elastic customers.

Fulton Fish Market data has also been used to illustrate advances to instrumental variable methods in econometrics.

<doc id="458887" wikidata="Q242670" url="?curid=458887" title="Ealhswith">
<text>Ealhswith or Ealswitha was wife to King Alfred the Great. She was one of the most powerful noble women in early medieval England during the time of the Vikings. She was mother to King Edward the Elder who succeeded King Alfred to the Anglo-Saxon throne. Her father was a Mercian nobleman, Æthelred Mucel, Ealdorman of the Gaini, which is thought to be an old Mercian tribal group. Her mother was Eadburh, a member of the Mercian royal family and her lineage was one of the primary reasons for Alfred taking Ealhswith as his wife. Her legacy persists; after her death in the nunnery she founded and in the estates left to her by Alfred.

==Descent==
A charter of 897 (S 1442) discusses the responsibilities of Ealhswith&#x27;s brother Æthelwulf towards the monastery of Winchcombe, and Barbara Yorke argues that as this monastery was claimed as a possession by the family of Ceolwulf and Coenwulf, brothers who were both kings of Mercia, Ealhswith was probably a member of this family. Richard Abels goes further, stating that she was descended from King Coenwulf.

This descent from Mercian Kings was what drew Alfred to Ealhswith, making her an attractive candidate for marriage. During the time of King Alfred’s reign, he inherited Wessex through his late father, King Æthelwulf, and the genealogies of both Aethelwulf, and Alfred’s mother, Osburh, were used to justify his rule over England. His marriage with Ealhswith was seen as an alliance and a merging of other kingdoms within England. Ealhswith’s genealogy and descent from ancient Mercian Kings was used to grant Alfred the right to rule over all of England on the Wessex throne; an authority that he started at the beginning of his rule and was followed by his successors to the throne of Wessex.

==Life==
The Anglo-Saxon period of the Middle Ages ranged from about 450 to 1066, with Ealhswith rule falling toward the later Middle Ages. Contemporary sources tell us very little about her life. The only primary sources that reveals her name is in King Alfred’s Will. Within this Will, she is the last beneficiary listed. Alfred grants her estates at Lambourn, Wantage, and Edington, along with one hundred pounds of gold. However, Alfred does not mention his three daughters by name or his youngest son, with Edward, his eldest son, being the only child named.

Asser was a Welsh monk who lived during the same time as Alfred, and he learned and taught at St. David’s in Wales. He was a scholar who would translate works of literature within St. David. The origins as to how Asser and Alfred met are unknown, but it is believed that they were at the same meeting after Alfred took control of the Welsh land. Asser would spend prolonged months with Alfred, translating works of literature for him and it was Alfred who approached Asser to write his biography, &quot;The Life of King Alfred&quot;. Within this biography, Asser writes about the genealogies of both Ealhswith and her mother, Eadburh. The Mercians kings Ealhswith hailed from were on Eadburh&#x27;s side of the family. However, Asser only mentions Eadburh by name and does not call Ealhswith by her own name. Instead, he refers to her as “a noble Mercian Lady” and that she was a “chaste widow” after the death of Alfred. It is unknown why Asser omitted Ealhswith&#x27;s name from the text, but chose to include her mother&#x27;s.

In recent history, authors have cited Ealhswith by name more frequently and acknowledged her accomplishments. In Alex Traves, &quot;Genealogy and royal women in Asser’s Life of King Alfred: politics, prestige, and maternal kinship in early medieval England,&quot; he highlights her significance to Alfred and that she was an ideal bride for him in terms of the lineage tied to her. Her importance to Alfred was showcased by Traves, giving her credit for being one of the contributing factors to Alfred inheriting the throne. Traves and other modern authors give her recognition for her contributions to the English throne compared to Ealhswith&#x27;s contemporaries.

She was married to Alfred in 868. His elder brother Æthelred was then king, and according to Asser, Alfred was regarded as heir apparent. The Danes occupied the Mercian town of Nottingham in that year and her marriage to King Alfred was seen as political leverage. Alfred inherited the throne after his brothers death in 871. In accordance with ninth century West Saxon custom, she was not granted the title of queen. According to King Alfred, this was due to a crime committed by a former queen of the West Saxons, Eadburh, who had attempted to poison an enemy and accidentally killed her husband King Beorhtric instead in 802. 

Ealhswith had five children that survived to adulthood. Royal women, like Ealhswith, in the Middle Ages took a secondary role when tending for their children. Wet nurses breast-fed Ealhswith&#x27;s children for her, as opposed to Ealhswith doing it herself. This was not uncommon as royal women lived busy lives and the wet nurses aided in raising Alfred and Ealhswith’s young. However, since Ealhswith descended from Mercian royalty, she played an active role in her children’s education. Ealhswith passed down knowledge she had learned from her family to her children, so she became an active role in her children’s lives later in life. 

There is no evidence citing that she witnessed any known charters during the reign of her husband. She played a more prominent role in the lives of her children and was never involved with her husbands’ charters. 

After Alfred&#x27;s death, in 901, Ealhswith did witness one charter during the reign of her son King Edward in which she is identified as &quot;Ealhswið mater regis&quot;, Ealhswith mother of the king. Her name is subscribed immediately after King Edward, and before Edward&#x27;s wife Ælfflæd. 

Alfred left his wife three important symbolic estates in his will, Edington in Wiltshire, the site of one important victory over the Vikings, Lambourn in Berkshire, which was near another, and Wantage, his birthplace. These were all part of his bookland, and they stayed in royal possession after her death.

Ealhswith died on 5 December 902, and was buried in her son Edward&#x27;s new Benedictine abbey, the New Minster, Winchester. Edward also had his father, Alfred, moved to New Minster, Winchester to be with Ealhswith in death. She is commemorated in two early tenth century manuscripts as &quot;the true and dear lady of the English&quot;.

== Patron ==
During her lifetime, England was not yet fully Christianized, although Ealhswith was a devout Christian as she made generous donations to her own nunnery.

A common practice of royal women during the Anglo-Saxon Middle Ages was the founding of nunneries. These nunneries were often where royal or noble women retired upon the death of their husbands. Kings often sent their wives to nunneries to keep them away from political criticism that could follow their death, and to ensure that their wives did not do anything to tarnish their legacy.

Ealhswith both founded a nunnery and retired to one after the death of King Alfred in 899. Ealhswith founded Nunnaminster at some time before her death. Nunnaminster was renamed to the abbey of St.Mary, and Ealhswith&#x27;s son, Edward the Elder, sent his daughter Eadburh there to become a nun. After Alfred’s death in 899, Edward had Ealhswith move to his nunnery in New Minster, where she lived out the rest of her days. Ealhswith made contributions and was a patron to Nunnaminster until her death in 902.

== Children ==
Alfred and Ealhswith had five children who survived to adulthood.

<doc id="458890" wikidata="Q902337" url="?curid=458890" title="Hercules in New York">
<text>Hercules in New York is a 1970 American fantasy action comedy film directed by Arthur Allan Seidelman and written by Aubrey Wisberg. It was released on home video under the title &quot;Hercules Goes Bananas&quot;. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger in his acting debut as the eponymous divine hero, who engages in escapades after traveling to New York City. Produced independently by Wisberg on a budget of $300,000, the film was shot entirely on location.

==Plot==
Hercules, at Olympus, berates his father Zeus for not allowing him to leave the gods&#x27; abode to adventure on Earth. Eventually Zeus sends Hercules, on a beam, to the land of men.

After some strange encounters in the air and at sea, including scaring an old woman on a passenger jet, Hercules arrives in New York City, where hilarity ensues in the form of interactions with various New Yorkers, who regard him as physically superior but socially awkward. He befriends a skinny little man called Pretzie, named because he sells pretzels. Hercules becomes a successful professional wrestler.

Zeus, watching Hercules from the heights, becomes irritated with Hercules&#x27; antics, which he feels are making a mockery of the gods, and calls on Mercury to stop Hercules. After Mercury tries but fails to bring Hercules home, Zeus orders Nemesis to see to it that Hercules is consigned to the infernal regions ruled over by Pluto.

However, Juno instead convinces Nemesis to poison Hercules with a poison that would strip him of his divinity and then talk to Pluto. Nemesis informs Pluto of what is happening and he bets a large sum of money against Hercules in an upcoming strongman competition with Hercules&#x27; gangster manager. When Hercules loses the strongman competition his friends try to head off Hercules&#x27; angry manager&#x27;s henchmen, but Hercules follows them to save them.

Meanwhile, Zeus uncovers the truth from Nemesis as to what is happening but only intervenes at the last minute to restore Hercules&#x27; divinity, not wanting any son of his to die at the hands of a mortal.

Hercules defeats the gangsters and realizes that he has been disobedient and returns to the heavens shortly after, only saying good-bye to Pretzie over a radio after he leaves.

In the heavens, Zeus tells Juno and Hercules that he will not punish Hercules for his behavior as they ask him about it and then asks to be left alone. They leave him alone, and upon their departure, Zeus sneaks out of the heavens and descends to Earth, scaring a passenger jet on his way down.

==Cast==
==Production==

&quot;Hercules in New York&quot; was the acting debut of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was 22 years old. At the time he was living in Los Angeles and making ends meet by running a bricklaying business with fellow bodybuilder Franco Columbu, while weight training and participating in bodybuilding competitions. Schwarzenegger, who had expressed interest in pursuing an acting career, auditioned at the encouragement of his friend Reg Park, a successful bodybuilder who had starred in a series of successful &quot;Hercules&quot; films produced in Italy. According to Schwarzenegger, during his audition his agent said he had years of &quot;stage&quot; experience, implying theater, when he had only appeared on bodybuilding stages.

The film was also the directorial debut of Arthur Allan Seidelman, who up until then had only directed theatre. The film was independently produced on a low budget, and filmed entirely in real locations in New York City. Several scenes including an elaborate chariot chase were shot without permits.

Playing the film&#x27;s title character, Schwarzenegger, because of his long last name and to play off the name of fellow cast member comedian Arnold Stang, is credited as &quot;Arnold Strong &#x27;Mr. Universe&#x27;&quot;. At the time filming began, Schwarzenegger had just come in first place in both professional and amateur Universe Championships. Production of the film coincided with his training for the competition for the second year in a row, and after it ended, he won the professional title again, beating Park.

Schwarzenegger had all his lines dubbed by an uncredited voice actor due to his thick Austrian accent, although the Trimark DVD has an &quot;Original English Dialogue&quot; audio track with Arnold&#x27;s voice. However, in that version&#x27;s final scene, Schwarzenegger&#x27;s voice is not restored when Hercules speaks to Pretzie through his small transistor radio, since that scene was shot without Schwarzenegger present and the voice was added via ADR.

==Release==
===Copyright===
On October 19, 2006, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that rightsholder Premiere Pictures was auctioning off the rights to the film on eBay for a minimum bid of $550,000.

<text>The Trans-European Networks (TEN) were created by the European Union by Articles 154–156 of the Treaty of Rome (1957), with the stated goals of the creation of an internal market and the reinforcement of economic and social cohesion. To various supporters of this policy, it made little sense to talk of a big EU market, with freedom of movement within it for goods, persons and services, unless the various regions and national networks making up that market were properly linked by modern and efficient infrastructure. The construction of Trans-European Networks was also seen as an important element for economic growth and the creation of employment.

The Treaty Establishing the European Community first provided a legal basis for the TENs. Under the terms of Chapter XV of the Treaty (Articles 154, 155 and 156), the European Union must aim to promote the development of Trans-European Networks as a key element for the creation of the Internal Market and the reinforcement of Economic and Social Cohesion. This development includes the interconnection and interoperability of national networks as well as access to such networks.

According with these objectives, the European Commission developed guidelines covering the objectives, priorities, identification of projects of common interest and broad lines of measures for the three sectors concerned (Transports, Energy and Telecommunications). The European Parliament and the Council approved these guidelines after consultation with the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.

Many projects of common interest have benefited from financial support of the European Union budget through the TEN-budget line as well as the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund. The European Investment Bank has also greatly contributed to the financing of these projects through loans.

Three classes of network were defined by the treaty:
*Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T)
*Trans-European Energy Networks (TEN-E or TEN-Energy)
*Trans-European Telecommunications Networks (eTEN)

<text>was a Japanese organizational theorist and a professor in the engineering faculty at the University of Tokyo who was noted for his quality management innovations. He is considered a key figure in the development of quality initiatives in Japan, particularly the quality circle. He is best known outside Japan for the Ishikawa or cause and effect diagram (also known as the fishbone diagram), often used in the analysis of industrial processes.

== Biography ==
Kaoru Ishikawa was born in Tokyo, the eldest of the eight sons of Ichiro Ishikawa. In 1937, he graduated from the University of Tokyo with an engineering degree in applied chemistry. After college, he worked as a naval technical officer from 1939 to 1941. From 1941 to 1947, Ishikawa worked at the Nissan Liquid Fuel Company. In 1947, Ishikawa started his academic career as an associate professor at the University of Tokyo. He undertook the presidency of the Musashi Institute of Technology in 1978.

In 1949, Ishikawa joined the Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers (JUSE), an organization developed to promote systematic studies needed to stimulate the nation&#x27;s economy. After World War II, Japan experienced rapid and sustained economic growth. This was mostly achieved due to the rapid development of their manufacturing and the industrial sectors. At the time before the Japanese Economic Miracle, the United States still perceived Japan, as a producer of cheap wind-up toys and poor-quality cameras. It was with the help of Ishikawa&#x27;s skill at mobilizing large groups of people towards a specific common goal that was largely responsible for Japan&#x27;s quality-improvement initiatives. He translated, integrated and expanded the management concepts of W. Edwards Deming and Joseph M. Juran into the Japanese system. Ishikawa used this concept to define how continuous improvement (kaizen) can be applied to processes when all variables are known.

After becoming a full professor in the engineering faculty at the University of Tokyo (1960), Ishikawa introduced the concept of quality circles (1962) in conjunction with JUSE. This concept began as an experiment to see what effect the &quot;leading hand&quot; (Gemba-cho) could have on quality. It was a natural extension of these forms of training to all levels of an organization (the top and middle managers having already been trained). Although many companies were invited to participate, only one company at the time, Nippon Telephone &amp; Telegraph, accepted. Quality circles would soon become very popular and form an important link in a company&#x27;s Total Quality Management system. Ishikawa would write two books on quality circles (&quot;QC Circle Koryo&quot; and &quot;How to Operate QC Circle Activities&quot;).

According to Quality Digest, one of his efforts to promote quality were the Annual Quality Control Conference for Top Management (1963) and several books on quality control (the &quot;Guide to Quality Control&quot; (1968) contained the first published example of a Pareto chart.) He was the chairman of the editorial board of the monthly &quot;Statistical Quality Control.&quot; Ishikawa was involved in international standardization activities.

1982 saw the development of the Ishikawa diagram, which is used to determine the root causes of a problem.

After Ishikawa died in 1989, Juran delivered this eulogy:

==Contributions to improvement of quality==
* User-friendly quality control.
* Fishbone cause and effect diagram – Ishikawa diagram.
* Implementation of quality circles.
* Emphasised the internal customer.
* Shared vision.
* Kaizen (continual improvement).
* Next operation as customer (NOAC)

==Awards and recognition==
* 1972 American Society for Quality&#x27;s Eugene L. Grant Award 
* 1977 Blue Ribbon Medal by the Japanese Government for achievements in industrial standardization
* 1982 Walter A. Shewhart Medal 
* 1988 Awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasures, Second Class, by the Japanese government.

<text>Winterlude is an annual winter festival held in Ottawa, Ontario and Gatineau, Quebec (collectively known as the National Capital Region).

Winterlude is run by the Department of Canadian Heritage and was started in 1979. The event is one of Ottawa&#x27;s most important tourist draws, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. In 2007, it set a new attendance record of an estimated 1.6 million visits to one of the four Winterlude sites, and that record still stands as of 2024. BizBash has recognized Winterlude as one of the top 100 annual attractions in Canada and the United States.

==Activities==
===Attractions===
The focal point of Winterlude is the Rideau Canal Skateway which at 7.8 kilometres (approximately 5 miles) is the largest skating rink in the world.

Another primary site is the Snowflake Kingdom, which is located in Jacques-Cartier Park in Gatineau. This site is turned into a massive &quot;snow park&quot; with ice slides and snow sculptures and also hosts numerous events and activities for children.

Confederation Park, better known as Crystal Garden, is the site for the ice sculpture competition, the ice lounge and musical concerts. Marion Dewar Plaza at City Hall (across from Confederation Park) is the site of the Rink of Dreams, an ice-skating rink that hosts skating shows, DJ dance parties and interactive art displays throughout the Festival. Dow&#x27;s Lake also has a large skating area and hosts various activities.

Related activities include special exhibits at numerous Ottawa museums, special events in the ByWard Market, Sparks Street, and a variety of other events throughout the city.

The festival features mascots called &quot;Ice Hogs,&quot; fictional groundhog-like creatures. Legend has it they emerged during the last Ice Age from a magical ice vortex. Their presence brings a touch of magic to Winterlude, delighting both young and old who appreciate the winter season.

Corridas 
Several racing events are held in conjunction with Winterlude. The Gatineau Loppet, inaugurated in 1979, is an internationally recognized cross-country ski race that takes place in Gatineau Park. The event also holds snowshoe and Fatbike races. Since 1984, the Winterlude Triathlon has also been part of the festival. The format and location of the winter triathlon has changed frequently over the years. The race currently consists of a 8 km skate across the Rideau Canal, a 5 km run along Colonel By Drive, and a 6 km ski at Mooney&#x27;s Bay Park. Other race events include &quot;bed racing&quot; and &quot;ice dragon boat&quot; racing.

==Duration==
Winterlude spans three weekends, usually in February, and typically concludes on Family Day, which falls on a Monday. Between the first and second weekends, and the second and third weekends, there are very few events scheduled from Monday to Thursday. This results in a less crowded skating rink and pristine ice conditions, with only around a thousand skaters sharing it compared to larger numbers on weekends. Skate changing shacks and food catering kiosks along the skateway remain open during the weekdays.

The weather in Ottawa is notoriously unpredictable, and Winterlude often is hampered by warm temperatures. Mild weather is the bane of the Canal, as proper ice conditions require -10 °C/14 °F for proper freezing. The length of the skating season (which often extends past Winterlude) is therefore unpredictable. However, most events are usually not affected other than premature melting of ice and snow sculptures. The average length to which the canal is open for skating is 50 days, but varies greatly. In the 2001–2002 season there was a (then) record low 34 days of skating. The very next season, 2002–2003, the canal was open for a near-record high 72 days. The longest skating season was 1971–1972, lasting 95 days. The shortest was 2015–2016, lasting just 18 days.

<doc id="458921" wikidata="Q718419" url="?curid=458921" title="Pee Wee Russell">
<text>Charles Ellsworth &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Russell (March 27, 1906 – February 15, 1969) was an American jazz musician. Early in his career he played clarinet and saxophones, but he eventually focused solely on clarinet.

With a highly individualistic and spontaneous clarinet style that &quot;defied classification&quot;, Russell began his career playing traditional jazz, but throughout his career incorporated elements of newer developments such as swing, bebop, and free jazz. Writing in 1961, the poet Philip Larkin commented: &quot;No one familiar with the characteristic excitement of his solos, their lurid, snuffling, asthmatic voicelessness, notes leant on till they split, and sudden passionate intensities, could deny the uniqueness of his contribution to jazz.&quot;

==Early life==
Pee Wee Russell was born in Maplewood, Missouri, United States, and grew up in Muskogee, Oklahoma. As a child, he first studied violin, but &quot;couldn&#x27;t get along with it&quot;, then piano, disliking the scales and chord exercises, and then drums – including all the associated special effects. Then his father sneaked young Ellsworth into a dance at the local Elks Club to a four- or five-piece band led by New Orleans jazz clarinetist Alcide &quot;Yellow&quot; Nunez. Russell was amazed by Nunez&#x27;s improvisations: &quot;[He] played the melody, then got hot and played jazz. That was something. &quot;How did he know where he was or where he was going?&quot;&quot; Pee Wee now decided that his primary instrument would be the clarinet, and the type of music he would play would be jazz. He approached the clarinettist in the pit band at the local theatre for lessons, and bought an Albert-system instrument. His teacher was named Charlie Merrill, and used to pop out for shots of corn whiskey during lessons.

His family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1920, and that September Russell was enrolled in the Western Military Academy in Alton, Illinois. He remained enrolled there until October the following year, though he spent most of his time playing clarinet with various dance and jazz bands. He began touring professionally in 1922, and travelled widely with the Allen Brothers tent show and on riverboats St. Paul and J.S. He also played with a Charles Creath band at the Booker T. Washington Theater, a cultural epicenter for African Americans at the time. Russell&#x27;s recording debut was in 1924 with Herb Berger&#x27;s Band in St. Louis on &quot;Fuzzy Wuzzy Bird.&quot;.

==Career==
From his earliest career, Russell&#x27;s style was distinctive. The notes he played were somewhat unorthodox when compared to his contemporaries, and he was sometimes accused of playing out of tune. By the mid-1920s, Russell was a sought-after jazz clarinetist and worked with Jack Teagarden in pianist Peck Kelly&#x27;s band in Texas. Back in St. Louis, Russell played with Frankie Trumbauer and Bix Beiderbecke at the Arcadia Ballroom, which had hired Trumbauer as bandleader for the season spanning September 1925 and May 1926. For a short while, Jack Teagarden also played at the Arcadia, and Russell claimed that this was the greatest band he had ever played in. In 1926, he joined Jean Goldkette&#x27;s band, and the following year he left for New York City to join Red Nichols. While with Nichols&#x27;s band, Russell did frequent freelance recording studio work, on clarinet, soprano, alto and tenor sax, and bass clarinet. In 1932 he recorded with the Rhythmakers in New York City. He worked with various bandleaders (including Louis Prima) before beginning a series of residences at the jazz club &quot;Nick&#x27;s&quot; in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, in 1937. He played with Bobby Hackett&#x27;s big band, and began playing with Eddie Condon, with whom he would continue to work, off and on, for much of the rest of his life – though he complained, &quot;Those guys [at Nick&#x27;s and Condon&#x27;s] made a joke, of me, a clown, and I let myself be treated that way because I was afraid. I didn&#x27;t know where else to go, where to take refuge&quot;.

From the 1940s onwards, Russell&#x27;s health was often poor, exacerbated by alcoholism – &quot;I lived on brandy milkshakes and scrambled-egg sandwiches. And on whiskey ... I had to drink half a pint of whiskey in the morning before I could get out of bed&quot; – which led to a major medical breakdown in 1951. He had periods when he could not play. Some people considered that his style was different after his breakdown: Larkin characterized it as &quot;a hollow feathery tone framing phrases of an almost Chinese introspection with a tendency to inconclusive garrulity that would have been unheard of in the days when Pee Wee could pack more into a middle eight than any other thirties pick-up player&quot;.

During World War II, he recorded V-Disc sides with Muggsy Spanier and the V-Disc All Stars. His composition &quot;Pee Wee Speaks&quot; with Spanier was released as a V-Disc, as Navy V-Disc 135 and as Army V-Disc 344 in January, 1945.

He played with Art Hodes, Muggsy Spanier and occasionally bands under his own name in addition to Condon. In his last decade, Russell often played at jazz festivals and international tours organized by George Wein, including an appearance with Thelonious Monk with an extended solo on &quot;Blue Monk&quot; at the 1963 Newport Jazz Festival, a meeting which has a mixed reputation (first available on the LP, &quot;Miles &amp; Monk at Newport,&quot; and currently available as part of the Monk 2-CD set &quot;At Newport 1963–65&quot;). Russell formed a quartet with valve trombone player Marshall Brown, and included John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman tunes in his repertoire. Though often labeled a Dixieland musician by virtue of the company he kept, he tended to reject any label. Russell&#x27;s unique and sometimes derided approach was praised as ahead of its time and cited by some as an early example of free jazz. At the time of their 1961 recording &quot; Jazz Reunion&quot; (Candid), Coleman Hawkins (who had originally recorded with Russell in 1929 and considered him to be color-blind) observed that &#x27;&quot;For thirty years, I’ve been listening to him play those funny notes. He used to think they were wrong, but they weren&#x27;t. He’s always been way out, but they didn&#x27;t have a name for it then.&quot; George Wein&#x27;s &quot;Newport All-Stars&quot; album includes a slow blues called &quot;Pee Wee Russell&#x27;s Unique Sound&quot;.

By this time, encouraged by Mary, his wife, Russell had taken up painting abstract art as a hobby. Mary&#x27;s death in the spring of 1967 had a severe effect on him. His last gig was with Wein at the inaugural ball for President Richard Nixon on January 21, 1969. Russell died in a hospital in Alexandria, Virginia, less than three weeks later.

<text>Giovanni di Niccolò de Luteri, better known as Dosso Dossi ( 1489–1542), was an Italian Renaissance painter who belonged to the School of Ferrara, painting in a style mainly influenced by Venetian painting, in particular Giorgione and early Titian.

From 1514 to his death he was court artist to the Este Dukes of Ferrara and of Modena, whose small court valued its reputation as an artistic centre. He often worked with his younger brother Battista Dossi, who had worked under Raphael. He painted many mythological subjects and allegories with a rather dream-like atmospheres, and often striking disharmonies in colour. His portraits also often show rather unusual poses or expressions for works originating in a court.

==Biography==
Dossi was born in San Giovanni del Dosso, a village in the province of Mantua. His early training and life are not well documented; his father, originally of Trento, was a bursar (&quot;spenditore&quot; or &quot;fattore&quot;) for the Dukes of Ferrara. He may have had training locally with Lorenzo Costa or in Mantua, where he is known to have been in 1512. By 1514, he would begin three decades of service for dukes Alfonso I and Ercole II d&#x27;Este, becoming principal court artist. Dosso worked frequently with his brother Battista Dossi, who had trained in the Roman workshop of Raphael. The works he produced for the dukes included the ephemeral decorations of furniture and theater sets. He is known to have worked alongside il Garofalo in the Costabili polyptych. One of his pupils was Giovanni Francesco Surchi (&quot;il Dielai&quot;).

Dosso Dossi is known less for his naturalism or attention to design, and more for cryptic allegorical conceits in paintings around mythological themes, a favored subject for the humanist Ferrarese court (see also Cosimo Tura and the decoration of the Palazzo Schifanoia). Dossi employed eccentric distortions of proportion, which may appear caricature-like or even &#x27;primitivist&#x27;. The art historian Sydney J. Freedberg sees this characteristic as an expression of the Renaissance aesthetic of &quot;sprezzatura&quot; (i.e. &quot;studied carelessness&quot;, or artistic nonchalance). Dossi is also known for the atypical choices of bright pigment for his cabinet pieces. Some of his works, such as the &quot;Deposition&quot; have qualities that suggest some of Correggio&#x27;s works. Most of his works feature Christian and Ancient Greek themes and use oil painting as a medium.

The painting &quot;Aeneas in the Elysian Fields&quot; was part of the &quot;Camerino d&#x27;Alabastro&quot; of Alfonso I in the Este Castle, decorated with canvases depicting bacchanalia and erotic subjects including &quot;Feast of the Gods&quot; by Giovanni Bellini and &quot;Venus Worship&quot; by Titian. The frieze paintings were based on the Aeneid; this scene by Dossi is book 6, lines 635–709, wherein Aeneas is guided over the bridge into the Elysian Fields by the Cumaean Sibyl. Orpheus with the lyre flits in the forest; in the background are the ghostly horses of dead warriors.

In &quot;Hercules and the Pygmies&quot;, Hercules has fallen asleep after defeating Antaeus, and is set upon by an army of thumb-size pygmies, whom he defeats. He gathers them in his lion skin. Paintings depicting a powerful Hercules were commonly made for the then-ruler Duke Ercole II d&#x27;Este. The subjects of the &quot;Mythological Scene&quot; and &quot;Tubalcain&quot; are unknown.
Recently, &quot;Portrait of a Youth&quot; at the National Gallery of Victoria, has been identified by the museum as a portrait of Lucrezia Borgia by Dosso Dossi, having previously been regarded as the portrait of an unknown young male by an unknown painter.

In Ferrara, among his pupils were Gabriele Capellini, Jacopo Panicciati, and Giovanni Francesco Surchi.

<doc id="458931" wikidata="Q7176759" url="?curid=458931" title="Peter Salmon (producer)">
<text>Peter Salmon (born 15 May 1956) is a British television producer and executive. He is Chief Creative Officer of global content creator, producer and distributor Endemol Shine Group, leading the company’s creative direction globally and overseeing the Group’s UK business. Prior to taking his current role in April 2016, Salmon was Director of BBC Studios, the corporation&#x27;s production arm, and before that held a number of senior BBC roles including Chief Creative Officer of BBC Vision, effectively overseeing all of BBC television&#x27;s in-house programme production, and Director of BBC North.

==Early life and career==
Born in Burnley, Lancashire, Peter Derek Salmon studied at St Theodore&#x27;s RC High School in the town and then the University of Warwick and graduated in 1977 with a degree in European literature. He then spent six months working for the Voluntary Service Overseas charity, as a teacher in Sarawak. However, he had to return home sooner than expected when his father became ill with lung cancer, and he worked for a time in factories in his native Burnley. His father subsequently recovered, and Salmon obtained a job as a British Government press officer, before going on, in 1978, to work as a junior reporter for the &quot;Chatham News and Standard&quot; newspaper, where he worked alongside Martin Brunt, now crime correspondent of Sky News. He is a fan of Burnley F.C.

==Career==

===Initial BBC career===
In 1981 Salmon joined the staff of the BBC in London as one of six general trainees, alongside Kevin Lygo (now head of studios at ITV), multi-award-winning film-maker Peter Kosminsky and internet entrepreneur Dominic Cameron. In 1984 he was the director of the first dramatic reconstruction to be featured on the crime series &quot;Crimewatch&quot;, and he later went on to produce the programme. He also worked on the children&#x27;s magazine show &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and the current affairs series &quot;Newsnight&quot;.

In 1989 he moved away from the central BBC in London to become the Head of Television Features at BBC Bristol. There he oversaw over forty environmental documentaries made by the BBC Natural History Unit, and was also responsible for forging the BBC&#x27;s relationship with Bristol-based animation studio Aardman Animations, becoming an executive producer on the company&#x27;s Academy Award-winning short film &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; (1993).

===Channel 4 and Granada===
In 1993 he left the BBC to take up a position as Head of Factual Programmes at Channel 4, having been specifically identified as a &quot;rising star&quot; by the channel&#x27;s Chief Executive, Michael Grade. There he oversaw long-running documentary series such as &quot;Equinox&quot; and &quot;Cutting Edge&quot;, as well as his own commissions such as the controversial &quot;The Dying Rooms&quot; and &quot;The Red Light Zone&quot;, although the latter was much-criticised as over-sensationalist and lacking serious journalistic content. However, during his time in charge of Channel 4&#x27;s factual programmes, the department won several British Academy Television Awards, Royal Television Society Awards, International Emmys and two successive Prix Italias.

During his time at Channel 4, Salmon was also responsible for overseeing the channel&#x27;s annual Alternative Christmas Message, broadcast opposite Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s official message on BBC One and ITV every 25 December at 3pm. In 1994, Salmon attracted some criticism for choosing the controversial American civil rights campaigner Jesse Jackson to deliver the message.

He left Channel 4 in February 1996 to become Director of Programmes at Granada Television, one of the largest companies of the ITV network and one of the major providers of nationally-networked programming for the channel. During his time at Granada he oversaw successes such as the comedy drama &quot;Cold Feet&quot; (1997) and the docudrama &quot;Hillsborough&quot; (1996), although both of these had already been commissioned before he joined the company.

===BBC One===
In 1997 he left Granada after only twenty months to return to the BBC when the job of Controller of BBC One, the corporation&#x27;s primary channel, became available. This vacancy had come as something of a surprise, resulting from Michael Jackson&#x27;s sudden move to Channel 4 after just a year in charge. Salmon took charge of BBC One in September 1997.

Salmon rejoined the BBC at a difficult time, when it was losing many senior executives such as Jackson to rival broadcasters. Responsible for a £652 million annual programming budget, Salmon commissioned several successful programmes, such as the drama series &quot;Clocking Off&quot; (2000–03) and the sitcoms &quot;Dinnerladies&quot; (1998–2000) and &quot;My Family&quot; (2000–2011).

However, prior to the arrival of new Director-General of the BBC Greg Dyke in 2000, BBC One had suffered from under-investment, and for three successive years of Salmon&#x27;s time in charge the channel was criticised in the annual report of the Board of Governors of the BBC for its performance and output. Dyke himself criticised the channel directly during the 2000 Edinburgh International Television Festival, firstly claiming it &quot;had to do better&quot; while delivering the annual MacTaggart Lecture, and then later criticising the policy of building lightweight drama series such as &quot;Harbour Lights&quot; (1999–2000) and &quot;Sunburn&quot; (1999–2000) around former soap opera stars. Salmon also found himself criticised in the media for rescheduling and cutting back on the annual number of editions of BBC One&#x27;s flagship current affairs series &quot;Panorama&quot;. BBC One also saw its audience fall to record lows on several occasions during Salmon&#x27;s period in charge.

Finally, on 13 September 2000, the BBC officially announced that Salmon was to leave BBC One to become the new Director of BBC Sport. His successor was eventually confirmed as being Lorraine Heggessey, who had been widely speculated as replacing Salmon even before his departure had been confirmed.

===BBC Sport, Television Corporation and BBC Vision Productions===
Salmon&#x27;s new role saw the BBC&#x27;s sports coverage across television, radio and online services being brought together under a single head of department for the first time. Although the BBC lost the prestigious television rights to The Boat Race in 2004 during Salmon&#x27;s period in charge, the department was able to win back high-profile events such as the FA Cup (in 2001, after having previously lost the event to ITV in 1997), England football internationals (in 2001), and FA Premier League football highlights for &quot;Match of the Day&quot; (2004). He also oversaw the development of interactive television coverage of the Wimbledon tennis championships and the 2002 Commonwealth Games, and was in charge of the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the prestigious 2002 FIFA World Cup, 2004 UEFA European Football Championship and 2004 Summer Olympics events. He was aided in these achievements by a large increase in the department&#x27;s budget from Director-General Greg Dyke; in 2003 alone, BBC Sport was given a budget of £300 million.

In July 2005, he left the BBC to become the Chief Executive of the independent production company Television Corporation, producers of programmes such as &quot;The Hamburg Cell&quot;. However, when Television Corporation was taken over by the Welsh company Tinopolis, Salmon left the organisation. He returned to the BBC in 2006 to become Chief Creative Officer of the new &quot;BBC Vision Productions&quot; set-up, overseeing all creative output from the BBC&#x27;s in-house production centres.

In December 2008 he became the director of BBC North Group Division, and in May 2014 was appointed Director of BBC England.

==Personal life==
Salmon is married to the actress Sarah Lancashire.

<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the European Union:

The European Union (EU) is an economic and political union of 27 member states, located primarily in Europe. Committed to regional integration, the EU was established by the Treaty of Maastricht on 1 November 1993 upon the foundations of the pre-existing European Economic Community. With about 445 million citizens, the EU generates an estimated 30% share (US$18.4 trillion in 2008) of the nominal gross world product. The EU has seven principal decision-making bodies known as the Institutions of the European Union, while the adoption of laws and coordination of EU policies is the role of the Council of the European Union which currently meets in ten different configurations.

<doc id="458946" wikidata="Q1991431" url="?curid=458946" title="Astrophyllite">
<text>Astrophyllite is a very rare, brown to golden-yellow hydrous potassium iron titanium silicate mineral. Belonging to the astrophyllite group, astrophyllite may be classed either as an inosilicate, phyllosilicate, or an intermediate between the two. It forms an isomorphous series with kupletskite, to which it is visually identical and often intimately associated. Astrophyllite is of interest primarily to scientists and collectors.

Heavy, soft and fragile, astrophyllite typically forms as &quot;bladed&quot;, radiating &quot;stellate&quot; aggregates. It is this crystal habit that gives astrophyllite its name, from the Greek words &quot;astron&quot; meaning &quot;star&quot; and &quot;phyllon&quot; meaning &quot;leaf&quot;. Its great submetallic gleam and darkness contrast sharply with the light (felsic) matrix the mineral is regularly found within. Astrophyllite is usually opaque to translucent, but may be transparent in thin specimens.

As the crystals themselves possess perfect cleavage, they are typically left &quot;in situ&quot;, the entire aggregate often cut into slabs and polished. Owing to its limited availability and high cost, astrophyllite is seldom seen in an ornamental capacity. It is sometimes used in jewellery where it is fashioned into cabochons.

Found in cavities and fissures in unusual felsic igneous rocks, astrophyllite is associated with feldspar, mica, titanite, zircon, nepheline, and aegirine. Common impurities include magnesium, aluminium, calcium, zirconium, niobium, and tantalum. It was first discovered in 1854 at its type locality; Laven Island, Norway. Kupletskite was not known until 1956, over a hundred years later.

Astrophyllite is found in a few scarce, remote localities: Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Quebec, Canada; Pikes Peak, Colorado, US; Narsarsuk and Kangerdluarsuk, Greenland; Brevig, Norway; and the Kola Peninsula, Russia.

<doc id="458948" wikidata="Q185277" url="?curid=458948" title="Flag of Nauru">
<text>Following the independence of Nauru, the flag of Nauru () was raised for the first time. The flag, chosen in a local design competition, was adopted on independence day, 31 January 1968. The design symbolically depicts Nauru&#x27;s geographical position, with a star just south of the Equator.

==Proportions and symbolism==
The flag reflects the geographical location of the island nation.

The narrow gold stripe with a width of of the length of the flag represents the Equator. The stripe along with the star signifies the location of the island in the Pacific Ocean one degree south of the Equator. The separation of the blue flag cloth into two equal parts recalls the saga, that the first inhabitants were to have been brought to Earth from two boulders.

Nauru itself is symbolised by a white 12-pointed star. The twelve points on the star represent the island&#x27;s twelve original tribes. The following twelve tribes are:

*Deiboe
*Eamwidara
*Eamwit
*Eamwitmwit
*Eano
*Eaoru
*Emangum
*Emea
*Irutsi
*Iruwa
*Iwi
*Ranibok

The blue signifies the Pacific Ocean, while the white colour of the star represents phosphate, a former major natural resource of the country.

== Construction Sheet ==
==Creation and adoption==
The flag was created by a resident employed by the Australian flag manufacturer Evans. It was officially adopted on 31 January 1968. Unlike some flags of Pacific nations (e.g., that of Tuvalu), Nauru&#x27;s flag has evoked little controversy.

<text>Baron Clifford of Chudleigh, of Chudleigh in the County of Devon, is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1672 for Thomas Clifford. The title was created as &quot;Clifford of Chudleigh&quot; rather than simply &quot;Clifford&quot; to differentiate it from several other Clifford Baronies previously created for members of this ancient family, including the Barony of de Clifford (1299), which is extant but now held by a branch line of the Russell family, having inherited through several female lines.

Baron Clifford of Chudleigh is the major surviving male representative of the ancient Norman family which later took the name &quot;de Clifford&quot; which arrived in England during the Norman Conquest of 1066, feudal barons of Clifford, first seated in England at Clifford Castle in Herefordshire, created Baron de Clifford by writ in 1299. The family seat is Ugbrooke Park, near Chudleigh, Devon.

Notable members of this branch of the Clifford family include antiquarian Arthur Clifford (grandson of the 3rd Baron), Victoria Cross recipient Sir Henry Hugh Clifford (son of the 7th Baron), Catholic clergyman William Clifford (son of the 7th Baron) and colonial administrators Sir Bede Clifford (son of the 10th Baron) and Sir Hugh Clifford (grandson of the 7th Baron). The family is also related to the notable recusant Weld family, of Lulworth Castle, through the 7th Baron&#x27;s marriage to the daughter of Cardinal Thomas Weld.

<text>Croyde is a village on the west-facing coastline of North Devon, England. The village lies on the South West Coast Path near Baggy Point, which is owned by the National Trust. It lies within the North Devon Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

Croyde village and its beach is on the Bristol Channel.The beach faces westwards toward the Atlantic Ocean which begins at Hartland Point some 22 miles in the distance.

Croyde Stream runs through the village, eventually leading to the beach. The centre of the village is roughly at the intersection of Hobbes&#x27; Hill, Jones&#x27; Hill and St. Mary&#x27;s Road. At this spot, Croyde Bridge carries the road over the stream.

Public services are provided by the North Devon District Council (NDDC) based in Barnstaple. The village is in the civil parish of Georgeham, and for ecclesiastical purposes within the Diocese of Exeter.

==Today==
The village has several small campsites, a small retail area and two large holiday parks; Croyde Bay Holiday Resort (operated by UNISON) and &quot;Ruda Holiday Park&quot;, operated by Parkdean Resorts.

The past 30 years have seen large increases in younger-age visitors developing around surfing. The impact of tourism on the village has been varied. Some local landowners have benefited from the increased property prices. Tourism has helped to create jobs that were lost in agriculture. Local farming has declined, with former farmland converted into caravan sites and fields for seasonal camping. Like many seaside villages, the phenomenon of second homes has pushed house prices beyond the reach of most local people. There is little year-round employment, because tourism is seasonal, and most businesses are closed out of season.

Since 1999, Croyde has hosted an annual surfing and music festival (GoldCoast Oceanfest) on the weekend closest to the summer solstice.

Croyde has also benefitted from the &#x27;street food revolution,&#x27; being the hometown of Lola&#x27;s Wings, which has a pitch there, and other visiting street food trucks and trailers.

During the summer season, an outdoor market is held every Tuesday in a field off Moor Lane, past Ruda Holiday Park and heading towards Baggy Point.

== History ==
Croyde supposedly takes its Celtic name from the Viking raider Crydda. However, others have speculated that as the word is similar to the Cornish word &#x27;Curd&#x27; that describes the geographical position of the village resting amongst a cradle of hills, it could also have taken its name from this. There is evidence of a settlement that dates before the Saxon Period though, so the correct name is unclear.

Croyde is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Crideholde / Crideholda: Erchenbald from Robert, Count of Mortain. 11 cattle and 100 sheep were recorded in the Domesday Book at Crideholde / Crideholda (Croyde) in 1086.

In the Medieval Period, there was a market sited at Croyde, most likely near the centre of the village where Jones&#x27; Hill, Hobbs&#x27; Hill, and St Mary&#x27;s Road meet.

During World War II, in 1943, the hamlet was commandeered by American soldiers who practised manoeuvres for the D-day landings. Most training took place on Saunton Sands/Braunton Burrows. After the war, Croyde returned to being a predominantly holiday resort.

In the 60s, about 150M south east of Withywell Lane, a Royal Observer Corps (ROC) bunker was constructed due to rising tensions with the Soviet Union and the need to watch the skies all over the UK for Soviet planes and or nuclear bombs / missiles. The bunker was disbanded in the 90s after the end of the Cold War and now sits in disrepair.

== Religious sites ==
Croyde has an Anglican church, St Mary Magdalene, and a Baptist chapel which is open on Sundays at 11 am.
== Transport ==
The nearest railway station is Barnstaple, away. From Monday to Saturday, there is an hourly bus service to Croyde from Barnstaple, with a two-hour frequency on Sundays.

Road transport from the M5 motorway is via the A361 trunk road.

Ferry services operate between Ilfracombe, roughly around 10–20 miles away, and Lundy Island.

The nearest airport to the village is Exeter International Airport, the second-closest being Bristol International.

== Education ==
Croyde has no education resources in the village. Children have access to Georgeham Primary School; secondary education is provided by Braunton Academy.

== Beach ==

The sandy beach, which as of 2022, holds &#x27;Blue Flag&#x27; status, lies at the back of the sheltered Croyde Bay. 
A large dune system has formed past the high-tide mark. Sand underlies the land surface between the beach and the centre of Croyde village, to the east. The beach forms the middle section of a trio of sandy beaches north of the Taw Estuary. Three-and-three-quarter-mile-long (6.0 km) Saunton Sands is to the south, and Woolacombe Sands, divided into Putsborough and Woolacombe beaches, is to the north. Barbecues and contained fires are not permitted on Croyde beach.

Croyde is used for surfing; the rides are generally short as the waves tend to pitch up and break quickly. There is a point break off Down End. There is a reef break at the northern (Baggy Point) end of the beach that works for about 60 minutes during some high tides. The shape of the bay funnels waves towards the beach. The beach is also steeper than either Woolacombe, Putsborough or Saunton Sands. Due to this, rip currents are extremely strong especially near the rocks at either end of the beach or at low tide, even when there is only a small swell. These currents present danger to the strongest of swimmers. Any bathing should be done within the lifeguard-patrolled area. The break is very compact at low tide, resulting in many injuries.

<text>The national flag of Cuba () consists of five alternating stripes (three navy blue and two white) and a cherry red chevron at the hoist, within which is a white five-pointed star. It was designed in 1849 and officially adopted May 20, 1902. The flag is referred to as the &quot;&quot;, or the &quot;Lone Star&quot; flag. It is in the stars and stripes flag family.

==History and symbolism==
Fighting against the Spanish Crown with the rebel armies of Venezuela, Narciso López moved from his native Caracas to Havana, Cuba. His involvement in anti-colonial movements forced him into exile. In 1849, he moved to New York City, United States, where he continued to advocate for an independent Cuba.

The three blue stripes represent the three departments in which Cuba was divided at that time; the white, purity of the patriot cause; and the red triangle, a symbol of strength, constancy, and Mason influences (triangles are Masonic symbols for equality and were found in a number of other flags in the former Spanish empire).

The poet Miguel Teurbe Tolón designed the flag alongside Lopez, based upon the story of López&#x27;s vision. Emilia Teurbe Tolón, Miguel&#x27;s wife, sewed the first flag. López and Tolón, together with José Aniceto Iznaga Borrell, his nephew José María Sánchez Iznaga, Cirilo Villaverde and Juan Manuel Macías, settled upon the final design for the flag of Cuba: two white stripes, three blue, a red triangle, and a lone star.

López used this same flag in 1850 to carry out his coup attempt to liberate Cuba from Spanish rule, which resulted in failure. The coastal town of Cárdenas was the first town that saw the lone star flag hoisted on May 19, 1850, in the taking of the city by Cuban rebels.

A year after the start of the Ten Years&#x27; War, the first Constituent Assembly of the Republic of Cuba met arms in Guáimaro, Camagüey Province. The debate focused on two flags of great symbolism, the Demajagua – which was very similar to the Chilean flag – created by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes to give start to the war of independence, and the Lone Star of López, the latter being chosen since López had taken the first step for the freedom of Cuba. The Demajagua flag was not scrapped, but instead, was put in the sessions of the House of Representatives and retained as part of the national treasure.

On the morning of May 20, 1902, the day Cuba officially became an independent republic, Generalissimo Máximo Gómez had the honor of hoisting the flag on the flagpole of the castles of the Tres Reyes del Morro, Havana; therefore sealing with this act the end of the Cuban revolution, the end of struggle for Cuban independence, and at the same time justifying the sacrifice that so many offered to make this dream become reality.

Both the flag and the coat of arms were designed by Miguel Teurbe Tolón. The design specifications of both were formally established by decree of the first president of Cuba, Tomás Estrada Palma, on April 21, 1906. The flag has remained unchanged since then, even during and after the 1959 Cuban Revolution, which established the present-day communist state of the Republic of Cuba.

In 2019, Cuba introduced the &quot;National Symbols Bill&quot;. The official press release said the bill &quot;would establish more flexible use of these items with a view toward promoting their greater presence in society, within a legally defined, respectful framework&quot;. According to ADN Cuba, the bill states that the flag could be used &quot;as a means of publicity only when the messages that are transferred contribute to fostering and developing patriotic values in people and to form a patriotic conscience of respect and veneration for them and for the historical tradition of the nation&quot;. In August 2019, artists from the San Isidro Movement launched a campaign using the hashtag &quot;#&quot; to protest against restrictions placed on the use of the Cuban flag by the Cuban government and the arrest of artist Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara under the new law.

==Subsequent use==
In April 1869, López&#x27;s flag was designated the national banner by the Congress of the Republic of Cuba. López&#x27;s flag was the model for the flag of Puerto Rico adopted in 1895 by the Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico, a pro-independence group that worked under the auspices of the Cuban Revolutionary Party.

After the United States seized Cuba from Spain during the Spanish–American War, the U.S. flag flew from January 1, 1899, until independence was granted. On May 20, 1902, the Cuban national flag was hoisted as a symbol of independence and sovereignty. It has been used ever since, remaining unchanged even after the Cuban Revolution of 1959. During the revolution, Cuban president Fidel Castro&#x27;s 26th of July Movement created a party flag equally divided in red and black like the Angolan national flag usually in horizontal stripes and often with inscriptions, which is often flown on public buildings.

==Specifications==
The Cuban flag is at a length-to-width ratio of 2:1. It is made up of 5 alternating horizontal stripes, three blue and two white. These blue and white stripes are of equal width. The color of blue is specifically turquiose. The red chevron is in the shape of an equilateral triangle. The star within the chevron has a diameter that is the length of the hoist. Its middle is halfway up the flag.

<text>The flag of the Czech Republic () is the same as the flag of the former Czechoslovakia. Upon the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in December 1992, the Czech Republic kept the Czechoslovak flag while Slovakia adopted its own flag. The first flag of Czechoslovakia was based on the flag of Bohemia and was white over red. This was almost identical to the flag of Poland (only the proportion was different), so a blue triangle was added at the hoist in 1920. The flag was banned by the Nazis in 1939 as they established a government nominally in control of Bohemia and Moravia, and a horizontal tricolour of white, red, and blue was used for the duration of the war. The 1920–1939 flag was restored in 1945.

== History ==
The traditional colours of the Czech lands originated from an 1192 coat of arms (depicting a rampant lion with a double silver tail on a field of red).

After the establishment of an independent Czechoslovakia in 1918, the country had been using the red and white flag of Bohemia, almost identical to the Polish flag officially adopted in 1919. Following calls for a new flag to be adopted, a committee picked a design by Jaroslav Kursa, an archivist in the Czechoslovak Ministry of the Interior. His design included the red and white horizontal stripes derived from the coat of arms of Bohemia and added a blue chevron extended halfway.

The flag was officially approved by the National Assembly of Czechoslovakia on 30 March 1920 and since then, it has been in continuous use, with the exception of the German occupation of Czechoslovakia during the Second World War. Additionally, during a short period following the Velvet Revolution, between 1990 and 1992, the Czech part of the Czechoslovak federated state adopted the previous red and white flag.

During the 1992 negotiations on the split of Czechoslovakia, a clause forbidding the use of the state symbols of Czechoslovakia by either successor state was inserted into the legislation concerning the dissolution of the federation. However, the Czech Republic kept the use of the flag.

== Dimensions ==

The blazon of this flag is &quot;per pall fesswise Argent, Azure, and Gules&quot;. The flag is formed from an isosceles triangle that extends halfway along the rectangle (a common mistake is to draw it shorter) and two bands: one white and one red. The most similar foreign flag is the flag of the Philippines but the latter has dimensions 1:2, the three colours permuted, and additional golden-yellow symbols added on it.

==Presidential standard==

Another Czech official symbol is the standard of the president of the Czech Republic. It was first introduced in 1918 for the president of Czechoslovakia. The current version, which was designed by heraldist Jiří Louda, was adopted upon the creation of an independent Czech Republic in 1993.

<text>Adrian Carmack (born May 5, 1969) is an American video game artist and one of four co-founders of id Software, along with Tom Hall, John Romero, and John Carmack (no relation). The founders met while working at Softdisk″s &quot;Gamer&#x27;s Edge&quot; division and started id in 1991. Adrian Carmack&#x27;s primary role at the company was as an artist, including work on &quot;Commander Keen&quot;, &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Quake&quot;, &quot;Quake II&quot; and &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;. He is credited as the creator of Doom&#x27;s grotesque, gory art style as well as the term &quot;gibs&quot;. 

He was a 41% owner of ID until he left the company in 2005. At the time the press was told he felt he had done all he could do in the gaming field and was planning to pursue his passions of art. However, in September 2005, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; revealed he was taking his former business partners to court, claiming he was effectively fired by them in an attempt to force him to sell his 41% stake in the company for $11 million (~$ in ) under the terms of a contract he wants the court to nullify. $11 million is thought to be a fraction of the true value of his stake, which is thought to be closer to $43 million after the company received a $105 million bid from Activision in 2004.

In September 2014, Carmack was revealed as the new owner of the five-star Heritage Golf &amp; Spa Resort in Killenard, Ireland.

In April 2016, it was reported that Carmack had reunited with Romero under a new Galway, Ireland-based start-up, The Night Work Games, to produce a new video game, &quot;Blackroom&quot;, for which they had launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. The game has been described as &quot;a return to fast, violent and masterful play on the PC&quot;. Later the campaign was put on hold to allow Carmack and Romero time to complete a working demo of the game. According to the two developers, their decision was based on players&#x27; feedback regarding the playability of the demo. The company behind Blackroom, Night Work Games, was seeking $700,000 to fund the development of the game. Before being put on hold, the campaign had raised $131,052 from its supporters.

<doc id="458967" wikidata="Q19483764" url="?curid=458967" title="Mal Young">
<text>Mal Young (born 26 January 1957) is a British television producer, screenwriter and executive producer.

==Career==

=== Mersey TV ===
Young began his career in graphic design. At age 27, he began working in television on the Channel 4 soap opera &quot;Brookside&quot;. Over nearly a decade, he worked his way up from extra to become the show&#x27;s producer in the early 1990s. His tenure was criticised for taking the show away from its social realist roots towards a more sensationalist, ratings-chasing format. He oversaw the iconic Jordache Body Under The Patio storyline, as well as conceiving the first lesbian kiss on pre-watershed British TV achieving record ratings for the series and for Channel 4. He also co-created and produced his own successful drama series for Channel 4, &quot;And The Beat Goes On&quot;.

=== Pearson TV ===
Young moved on to become head of drama at the independent production company Pearson Television, where he oversaw work on ITV police drama &quot;The Bill&quot; and another soap opera, Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;Family Affairs&quot;, which he created, and was executive producer on C5&#x27;s legal drama series, the BAFTA-nominated &quot;Wing and a Prayer&quot;.

=== BBC ===
From 1997 to 2004, Young moved to the BBC to become the Controller of Continuing Drama Series for the corporation&#x27;s in-house production arm. In this role, he was responsible for overseeing the organisation&#x27;s in-house continuing episodic drama series. Programmes he oversaw for the BBC included the soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;; medical dramas &quot;Doctors&quot;, &quot;Casualty&quot;, and the latter&#x27;s spin-off series &quot;Holby City&quot;, which he co-created; police dramas &quot;Dalziel and Pascoe&quot;, &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;, and &quot;Merseybeat&quot;; anthology shows &quot;The Afternoon Play&quot; and &quot;Murder in Mind&quot;; legal drama &quot;Judge John Deed&quot;; rural-set &quot;Down to Earth&quot;; comedy-drama &quot;Being April&quot;; and the revival of the science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, although he had left the BBC by the time the new version of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; aired in March 2005.

===19Television===
At the end of 2004, Young became head of drama at independent production company 19Television Limited, part of Simon Fuller&#x27;s 19 Entertainment. Along with former BBC Head of Development Serena Cullen, he was charged with developing new drama formats for the UK and US markets, and split his time between the US and UK. He co-created, wrote, and produced a drama pilot for Fox in March 2007, &quot;Born in the USA&quot;. He then co-wrote and sold another pilot to The CW in the US, &quot;Austin Golden Hour&quot;, a real-time medical drama series format for the 2008–2009 season.

===&quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;===
On 31 December 2015, Young cryptically said on his Twitter about what is next for him in 2016, &quot;This year I&#x27;m going to be Young and I&#x27;m going to be Restless.&quot; A few days later, Young sent several other tweets to the Twitter account of the American soap opera, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, announcing his hiring on the show. It was confirmed by CBS Daytime that Young had been hired as a producer. Young&#x27;s first episode as a supervising producer aired on 1 February 2016 and his last episode aired on 12 July 2016.

On 8 June 2016, after news of the firing of Y&amp;R executive producer Jill Farren Phelps, came confirmation that Young had replaced Phelps as executive producer of the American soap. His first episode as executive producer aired on 13 July 2016. On 31 July 2017, Daytime Confidential announced that both Kay Alden and Sally Sussman Morina would be departing from the show, with Young being named as the new head writer.

In December 2018, reports were released saying that Young had departed the show as executive producer and head writer. Young&#x27;s departure was later announced, as was the news of Josh Griffith and Tony Morina taking over his positions as head writer and executive producer, respectively.

In May 2019 at the 46th Daytime Emmy Awards, Young picked up the award for Best Show and Best Writing.

==Personal life==
Young is married to singer Mari Wilson, whom he met at a charity function in 2001.

==Recognition==
In September 1999, Young gave the Huw Weldon Royal Television Society lecture at their Cambridge convention. In July 2004, in a poll of industry experts conducted by &quot;Radio Times&quot;, he was voted the 9th-most powerful person in television drama. In May 2005, he received a special award for his contribution to television from ITV&#x27;s Soap Awards. He was the producer of the widely derided &quot;Desperate Scousewives&quot;. In November 2019, he received a Doctor of Letters (DLitt) from Glasgow Caledonian University in recognition of his outstanding contribution to British television and his support of and commitment to GCU&#x27;s MA TV Fiction Writing students, where he is a visiting professor.

It also owns over 1,600 properties in its real estate portfolio, including the capital&#x27;s six official residences; commercial, residential and heritage buildings; and agricultural facilities.

The NCC reports to the Parliament of Canada through whichever minister in the Cabinet of Canada is designated responsible for the &quot;National Capital Act&quot;, currently the Minister of Public Services and Procurement.

==History==

=== Ottawa Improvement Commission (1899–1927) ===
Through the 19th century, the character of what is known today as the National Capital Region was blemished and transformed by industrialization. According to then-Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, what became the City of Ottawa was &quot;not a handsome city&quot; by the 1880s. Laurier, together with Lady Aberdeen, the wife of the governor general, advanced the idea of planning for a better capital.

In 1899, the Ottawa Improvement Commission (OIC) was established with the core mandate of improving and beautifying the city. What began as the OIC evolved as an organization in terms of both mandate and scope over 120 years.

The OIC initially consisted of 4 (later 6) volunteer commissioners: three federal appointees, as well as the mayor of Ottawa. The OIC was supported by notable Capital builders, such as Government of Canada botanist William Saunders and Robert Surtees, former city engineer and designer of Major&#x27;s Hill Park. The Commission acquired land as early as 1901, and its first priority was to clean up the banks of the Rideau Canal, create and expand a park system, as well as a network of boulevards and parkways. One of the OIC&#x27;s first projects was the Rideau Canal Driveway (now the Queen Elizabeth Driveway).

Four years following its establishment, the OIC hired Frederick G. Todd, a pioneer in landscape architecture, to aid in reshaping the city. Todd completed his plan, dubbed as the Todd Report, in 1903. Two of his major recommendations were the construction of a ceremonial boulevard linking Rideau Hall and the Parliament Buildings, and the preservation of large natural parks adjacent to the Capital. This plan was the first to recommend improvements north of the Ottawa River.

==== The Todd, Holt, and Cauchon Reports ====
Following the Todd Report was a master plan for Canada&#x27;s Capital, tabled by Herbert S. Holt&#x27;s Federal Plan Commission (or, the Holt Commission). Todd was appointment chairmen when the Federal Plan Commission was established in 1913 by Order-In-Council of Prime Minister Robert Borden&#x27;s government with the purpose of &quot;draw[ing] up and perfect[ing]&quot; a comprehensive scheme for the future of the rapidly growing Federal Capital, called the &quot;General Plan.&quot; The Commission was joined by a renowned architect and urban planner from Chicago, Edward H. Bennett, who prepared the General Plan.

The &quot;Report of the Federal Plan Commission on a General Plan for the Cities of Ottawa and Hull,&quot; better known as the &quot;Holt Report&quot; or the &quot;Bennett Plan,&quot; was released in January 1915 and was one of Canada&#x27;s first comprehensive plans. The report recommended that the work of the OIC be broadened, expanding on the 1903 Todd Commission&#x27;s beautification proposals for urban parkways and a linked city park system. This included formally establishing Gatineau Park.

Most notably, the Report recommended a major political reform: the creation of a federal district and federal authority to exercise control over planning and development. The General Plan recommended extinguishing the Ottawa and Hull municipal governments. In their place, a Federal District Commission, similar to the governance model of Washington, D.C., was recommended. This Commission, reporting to the Government of Canada, would benevolently dictate the planning, development and operation of Canada&#x27;s Capital. Ultimately, the Holt/Bennett General Plan was shelved; however, many of its technical recommendations were implemented over 40 years after it was written.

In 1922, Noulan Cauchon, one of the founders of the Town Planning Institute of Canada, published a report (known as the &quot;Cauchon Report&quot;) containing a new planning strategy for the Capital. The report included numerous studies on the Capital done by Cauchon over a period of around 16 years. It also proposed the reorganization of railway tracks, the building of highways, the development of parks and parkways, and the relocation of industrial activities.

=== Federal District Commission (1927–58) ===

In 1927, the OIC was reorganized as the Federal District Commission (FDC). As its jurisdiction grew to include parts of Quebec, the FDC expanded the region&#x27;s open spaces, extended parkways, improved Dow&#x27;s Lake, and developed Confederation Square in conjunction with the City of Ottawa. In 1934, a citizens’ group urged the government to purchase land in the Gatineau Hills to save its forests. In 1937, three years later, the FDC began to acquire land for Gatineau Park and, by 1939, a total of 6,500 hectares had been acquired.

In 1936, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King invited French town planner Jacques Gréber to act as an advisor for planning in the Capital. A couple of years later, in 1938, Gréber was commissioned to develop a vision and plan for the National Capital Region, now famously known as the Gréber Plan.

Due to the Second World War, however, Gréber&#x27;s plan was put on hold. At the conclusion of the War in 1945, an area of was declared the &quot;National Capital District,&quot; and the &quot;Federal District Commission Ac&quot;t was amended to expand the responsibilities of the FDC, giving it a truly national scope.

Gréber was eventually invited back to develop his plan for the Capital, which was finally published in 1950.

=== National Capital Commission (1959–present) ===
In 1958, Parliament passed the &quot;National Capital Act&quot;, which established the National Capital Region as well as a new National Capital Commission (NCC) to succeed the FDC as responsible for bringing Gréber&#x27;s plan into reality. The replacement of the FDC came as result of it having repeatedly failed to convince municipal governments to cooperate in planning efforts regarding the National Capital Region.

The National Capital Region was expanded to a total of of land on both sides of the Ottawa River; for one thing, the NCC acquired the funds to purchase lands to create the Greenbelt. The &quot;National Capital Act&quot; gave, and continues to give, the NCC statutory authority to implement its plans, an authority confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Munro v National Capital Commission&quot;.

After the 2006 elections, the Government of Canada asked for a formal review of the mandate of the NCC. A panel conducting the review, in its report, suggested that the NCC needed more money and should become more transparent.

In 2018, the Government of Canada announced CA$55 million in funding to support critical repair and maintenance of NCC&#x27;s major infrastructure assets. In 2020, the NCC secured $52.4 million in funding towards some of its most significant assets.

== Assets ==
The NCC is responsible for managing and maintaining several assets in the Capital Region.

=== Scenic parkways ===
The NCC operates 90 kilometers of scenic parkways through Ottawa and NCC parks in Gatineau.

==== Gatineau ====

* Champlain Parkway
* Fortune Lake Parkway
* Gatineau Parkway
* Lac-des-Fées Parkway
* Leamy Lake Parkway

==== Ottawa ====
* Aviation Parkway
* Colonel By Drive
* Driveway (at the Central Experimental Farm)
* Island Park Drive
* Kichi Zibi Mikan
* Queen Elizabeth Driveway
* Sir George-Étienne Cartier Parkway

=== Urban parks ===
The NCC operates several urban parks in Ottawa and Gatineau.

* Commissioners Park
* Confederation Park
* Kìwekì Point
* Jacques-Cartier Park
* Leamy Lake Park
* LeBreton Flats Park
* Major&#x27;s Hill Park
* Vincent Massey Park

=== Official residences ===
The NCC is the steward of the Capital&#x27;s six official residences:

* Rideau Hall
* 24 Sussex Drive
* Harrington Lake
* Stornoway
* The Farm
* 7 Rideau Gate.

=== Other ===
Other assets managed by the NCC are:
* Agricultural and research facilities
* Capital Pathway
* Commemorative monuments (e.g. the National Holocaust Monument and the Royal Canadian Navy Monument)
* Confederation Boulevard
* Gatineau Park
* Greenbelt
* Real property and heritage buildings
* Rideau Canal Skateway

== Responsibilities ==

The role of the NCC is to champion the interests of Ottawa, Gatineau, and surrounding region as the nation&#x27;s capital, typically with regard to issues of national interest, such as the location of monument and museum sites, and major streetscapes such as Confederation Boulevard.

The objects and purposes of the NCC are &quot;to prepare plans for and assist in the development, conservation and improvement of the National Capital Region in order that the nature and character of the seat of the Government of Canada may be in accordance with its national significance.&quot;

The NCC is the Capital&#x27;s largest property owner, owning and managing over 11% of all lands in the Capital Region. It also owns over 1,600 properties in its real estate portfolio, including the Capital&#x27;s six official residences; commercial, residential and heritage buildings; and agricultural facilities.

Over 70 NCC-managed buildings that are older than 40 years have been designated as &quot;classified&quot; or &quot;recognized&quot; federal heritage buildings by the Federal Heritage Buildings Review Office (FHBRO).

The continuing preservation, evolution and management of Confederation Boulevard, the ceremonial route linking key attractions in National Capital Region, on both sides of the Ottawa River, in Ottawa as well as Gatineau, Quebec, are the responsibility of the NCC and its partners.

These roles are in contrast with the mandates of the various municipal governments, which serve the benefit of their immediate resident, under provincial legislation, on issues like road maintenance, sewer, water and public transport.

==Organization==
The NCC is the responsibility of the Minister of Public Works and Procurement, currently Filomena Tassi. In the 28th Canadian Ministry under Stephen Harper, the NCC reported to Parliament through the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and then through senior Ottawa-area cabinet ministers, the last of whom was Pierre Poilievre.

It is governed by the &quot;National Capital Act&quot;, which explains the boundaries of the National Capital Region in great detail. Its headquarters are in the Chambers Building on Elgin Street, between Queen and Sparks Streets.

=== Board of directors ===
Oversight and direction of the NCC&#x27;s operations and assets are the responsibility of its national board of directors.

As defined in the &quot;National Capital Act&quot;, the board consists of a chairperson, a chief executive officer (CEO), and 13 other members with relevant professional backgrounds from the Capital Region and across Canada. Since April 2016, the mayors of Ottawa and Gatineau have also &quot;ex officio&quot; held seats on the board, on a non-voting basis.

The NCC holds an annual public meeting in which members of the public are able to express their ideas and ask questions directly to the board. The scope of these annual meetings includes direct public input in a workshop to &quot;discuss the NCC&#x27;s strategic priorities for the coming year.&quot;

, current board members include:

* Tobi Nussbaum — Chief Executive Officer
* Marc Seaman — Chairperson
* Maude Marquis-Bissonnette — non-voting ex-officio participant (Mayor of Gatineau)
* Mark Sutcliffe — non-voting ex-officio participant (Mayor of Ottawa)
* Lisa M. MacDonald
* Tanya Gracie
* Mireille Apollon
* Larry Beasley
* Lise Bernier
* Victor Brunette
* Michael Foderick
* Caroline Lajoie
* Deborah Lynn Morrison
* Norm Odjick
* Sara Jane O&#x27;Neill
* Lou Ragagnin
* Denis B. Vaillancourt

==== Chairpersons and CEOs ====
The CEO is accountable to the board of directors for the management of the NCC&#x27;s operations and &quot;the implementation of the board&#x27;s strategic directions for the coming year.&quot;

=== Committees ===
The following are the committees and committee members of the NCC .

The 5-person Executive Committee is called upon when necessary to deal with specific business or issues. It can be delegated certain powers and functions by the board of directors. This Committee includes: Marc Seaman (chairperson), Mireille Apollon, Larry Beasley, Norm Odjick, and Tobi Nussbaum.

The 8-person Audit Committee oversees the NCC&#x27;s internal audit function, and reviews the special examinations and annual financial audits of the federal Office of the Auditor General. It also oversees the reporting of financial information, ensuring that the necessary processes and controls are in place for the NCC to achieve its objectives. This committee consists of 6 board members, plus the NCC chairperson and the CEO (as &quot;ex officio&quot; members).

The Governance Committee reviews (and makes recommendations to the board on) matters relating to amendments to the by-laws; the selection criteria for, duties of and benefits for the chairperson, CEO and other board and committee members; the mandate, functioning, competency profile and performance appraisals of the board and its committees; the terms of reference and the selection process for the ombudsman; and general governance issues. A minimum of 5 board members, plus the NCC chairperson and the CEO (as &quot;ex officio&quot; members) sit on the Governance Committee.

The Advisory Committee on Planning, Design and Realty advises on the long-range plans and policies for the use of public lands and properties in the Capital Region; design proposals affecting federal lands; and matters of real property. The committee consists of experts in real estate development; environmental, urban, and regional planning; urban design; architecture; and landscape architecture. The committee has 11 members, in addition to two board members who act as observers and two &quot;ex officio&quot; members (NCC chairperson and CEO). Aside from the NCC chairperson and CEO, this committee includes: Maryse Gaudreault (Ex-Officio member), Vincent Asselin (Chairperson), Ken Greenberg, David L.A. Gordon, Bruce Haden, Anne-Marie Parent, Tobi Nussbaum (Ex-Officio member), Barry Padolsky, Beverly A. Sandalack, Collinda Joseph (observer), Caroline Lajoie (observer), and Andy Kikites (observer).

The Advisory Committee on the Official Residences of Canada advises on asset management and matters that pertain to the 6 official residences in the Capital Region. The committee also provides advice to Public Services and Procurement Canada, who is responsible for the Citadel, i.e., the Governor General’s official residence in Québec City. The committee consists of experts in interior design, architecture, heritage, and real estate development. It has 7 members, plus 1 board observer and 2 &quot;ex officio&quot; members (the NCC chairperson and the CEO). Aside from the ex officio and observer members, committee members include: Marta Farevaag (chairperson), Bernard Serge Gagné (vice chairperson), Ken Greenberg, Hagit Hadaya, and Chris Piché.

The Canadiana Fund solicits donations of heritage art, furniture, and funds to augment the staterooms of the official residences. Pieces that are chosen are meant to &quot;reflect Canada&#x27;s heritage, artistic traditions and historical associations,&quot; or they &quot;complement the architectural style of a particular residence.&quot; The Canadiana Fund consists of Cynthia Price Verreault (chairperson), Anne Fotheringham, Kathy Hays, Douglas B. Richardson, Deborah Riley, Harvey A. Slack, Candace Stevenson, Clyde Wells, and Fei Wong.

The Advisory Committee on Universal Accessibility is mandated to assist the NCC by considering those projects that involve a significant universal accessibility component. It has 7 members—4 from outside the NCC and 3 NCC employees—all of whom are those who have expertise and experience in matters related to the subject. These members are Anne Ménard (chairperson), Collinda Joseph (vice-chairperson), Yoland Charette, Catherine Gardner, Rita Tadi, Daryl Rock, and Monique Beaudoin.

== Partnerships ==
The NCC has built relationships with people and organizations throughout the Capital Region and across Canada, including local municipalities and Indigenous communities. To foster partnerships in the planning and stewardship of the Capital, the NCC created the Urbanism Lab, where lectures, events, and public consultations take place on a regular basis.

The NCC is the Capital&#x27;s largest property owner, owning and managing over 11% of all lands in the Capital Region. As such, the NCC collaborates with the region&#x27;s municipalities on various issues, including urban planning, safe and active transportation, and property and land stewardship. The Capital Region includes 13 municipalities, the largest of which are Ottawa and Gatineau.

The Algonquin First Nation are among the region&#x27;s indigenous communities with whom the NCC works with in particular. Major Algonquin communities include: Pikwàkanagàn First Nation, located on the shores of the Bonnechere River and Golden Lake; and Kitigan Zibi Anishinabe First Nation, located just outside the municipality of Maniwaki.

The NCC also collaborates with other Government of Canada departments and agencies, as well as with national and international organizations and associations.

Other key collaborations and partnerships include:

* Canada&#x27;s Capital Cities Organization (CCCO) — includes representatives from the national, provincial, and territorial capitals of Canada, with the aim to foster dialogue among participants from various parts of the country.
* Capitals Alliance — a global forum for planners and urban designers in capital cities around the world.
* Ottawa Tourism — a private, nonprofit, membership-based organization that promotes tourism in Ottawa and the region.
* Outaouais Tourism — a private, nonprofit organization that encourages tourism in Gatineau, the Outaouais, and the region.
* Nokia — the title sponsor of the NCC&#x27;s Sunday Bikedays program since at least 2016.

== Criticisms ==
The Government of Canada is the largest employer and largest landowner in these two areas, and the NCC thus has a great deal of influence over the cities. This has sometimes been criticized by city officials from Ottawa and Gatineau for a lack of cooperation, such as in 1998 when the NCC proposed levelling a large strip of downtown Ottawa to build a ceremonial boulevard along the city&#x27;s existing Metcalfe Street.

Over the last 30 years, the activities of the NCC have been denounced or castigated by several Quebec governments. They considered municipal affairs to be a purely provincial jurisdiction, according to the constitution of Canada. Others have criticized the group for what they perceive to be poor or misguided planning decisions.

<doc id="458969" wikidata="Q4633" url="?curid=458969" title="Flag of Cyprus">
<text>The flag of Cyprus (; ) came into use on 16 August 1960, under the Zürich and London Agreements, whereby a constitution was drafted and Cyprus was proclaimed an independent state. The flag was designed by Turkish Cypriot artist İsmet Güney. The design of the flag deliberately employs peaceful and neutral symbols in an attempt to indicate harmony between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, an ideal that has not yet been realised. In 1963, Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities separated because of Cypriot intercommunal violence.

The national flag features the shape of the entirety of the island, with two olive branches below (a symbol of peace between the island&#x27;s two communities) on white (another symbol of peace). The olive branches signify peace between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The map on the flag is a copper-orange colour, symbolising the large deposits of copper ore on the island, from which it may have received its name.

==Creation==

The flag of the Republic of Cyprus was preceded by the flag of British Cyprus. Upon independence, Cyprus adopted a new flag. Under the constitution, the flag should &quot;have a neutral design and colour,&quot; i.e. it should not include either blue or red colours (the colours of the flag of Greece and the flag of Turkey), nor portray a cross or a crescent.

The original proposal, made by the former British colonial administration, featured a rust-brown K on a white field. It was rejected by the President Makarios III and Vice-president Fazil Küçük, who preferred a flag proposed by İsmet Güney, a Turkish Cypriot artist.

In the design of August 1960, the colour of the map is copper (Pantone 144-C). Both the crest and the two olive-tree leaves are olive green (Pantone 336-C). The background is white with the 3:5 ratio. In April 2006 the design was updated, the shape of the olive branches were slightly altered, its color was changed to Pantone 574, the copper color of the map was changed to Pantone 1385 and the ratio was changed to 3:2.

Flags produced on Cyprus often differ from the original specifications, both regarding the size of the map and the colours used. The government announced in October 2005, that it would take steps to &quot;start from scratch&quot; and assure that only flags complying with the official specifications would be produced.

Under the constitution of Cyprus, the flag of Cyprus may be flown by state institutions, public corporations, and citizens of the country.

== Use of the flags of Greece and Turkey==

According to the constitution, the community authorities and their institutions have the right to hoist the Greek flag or the Turkish flag alongside the flag of Cyprus during the holidays. Any citizen may, without any restriction, fly the Greek or Turkish flag, or both, next to the flag of Cyprus. Other provisions also allow municipalities, educational institutions and the National Guard to do so as well. Since the de facto division of the island, consecutive to the 1974 invasion, the flag of Greece is the only of the two flown in the area under the jurisdiction of the Republic of Cyprus, due to the predominant presence of Greek-Cypriots in that part of the island. Similarly, the flag of Turkey is only observed in the area under the control of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (recognised only by Turkey).

== Colours ==

==Proposed national flag==
Under the terms of the Annan Plan for Cyprus, a United Nations proposal to settle the Cyprus dispute, a new national flag would have been adopted by a reconstituted confederal republic of Cyprus. A competition was announced and the UN collected over 1000 proposals until 17 February 2003. Some of the proposals can be found on the webpage &quot;Cyprus seeks new flag&quot; by the BBC. It is possible that any future Cyprus settlement will include the adoption of a new flag.

In a referendum, the plan was accepted by Turkish Cypriots, but rejected by Greek Cypriots, therefore the plan was not put into place.

<doc id="458970" wikidata="Q1155342" url="?curid=458970" title="Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement">
<text>:&quot;Note: Within this article, &quot;CAFTA&quot; refers to the agreement as it stood before January 2004, and &quot;CAFTA-DR&quot; is used after that.&quot;

The Dominican Republic–Central America–United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR; Spanish: &quot;Tratado de Libre Comercio entre República Dominicana, Centroamérica y Estados Unidos de América,&quot; TLC) is a free trade agreement (legally a treaty under international law). Originally, the agreement encompassed the United States and the Central American countries of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and was called CAFTA. In 2004, the Dominican Republic joined the negotiations, and the agreement was renamed CAFTA-DR.

CAFTA-DR, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), and active bilateral free trade agreements such as the Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement are seen as bloc agreements instead of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) agreement. Panama has completed negotiations with the United States for a bilateral free trade agreement known as the Panama–U.S. Trade Promotion Agreement, and has been in effect since October 2012.

The CAFTA-DR constitutes the first free trade agreement between the United States and a small group of developing countries. It was created with the purpose of creating new and better economic opportunities by opening markets, eliminating tariffs, reducing barriers to services, and more. In 2015, it was estimated that the total two-way trade resulted in $53 billion (~$ in ). Nearly all Central American exports to the United States had already been tariff-free thanks to the 1984 Caribbean Basin Initiative.

==Ratification==
The agreement is a treaty under international law, but not under the U.S. Constitution because in the United States laws require majority approval in both houses, while treaties require two-thirds approval in the Senate only. Under U.S. law, CAFTA-DR is a congressional-executive agreement.

The U.S. Senate approved the CAFTA-DR on June 30, 2005, by a vote of 54–45, and the U.S. House of Representatives approved the pact on July 28, 2005, by a vote of 217–215, with two representatives not voting. Controversy arose over this vote because it was held open 1 hour and 45 minutes longer than the normal 15 minutes in order to get some members to change their votes. For procedural reasons, the Senate took a second vote on CAFTA on July 28 and the pact garnered an additional vote from Senator Joe Lieberman—who had been absent on June 30—in favor of the agreement. The implementing legislation became Public Law 109-053 when it was signed by President George W. Bush on August 2, 2005.

The Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras have also approved the agreement. They are all the current members of CAFTA-DR.

El Salvador became the first country to formally implement CAFTA, which went into effect on March 1, 2006, when the Organization of American States (OAS) received signed copies of the treaty. On April 1, 2006, Honduras and Nicaragua fully implemented the agreement. On May 18, 2006, the Congress of Guatemala ratified CAFTA-DR, which went into effect on July 1, 2006. The Dominican Republic implemented the agreement on March 1, 2007. In a referendum on October 7, 2007, Costa Rica narrowly backed the free trade agreement, with 51.6% voting &quot;Yes&quot;; the agreement took effect on January 1, 2009.

==Aims==
The goal of the agreement is the creation of a free trade area similar to NAFTA, which currently encompasses the United States, Canada, and Mexico. CAFTA-DR is also seen as a stepping stone towards the FTAA, another (more ambitious) free trade agreement that would encompass all the South American and Caribbean nations as well as those of North and Central America except Cuba. Canada is negotiating a similar treaty called the Canada–Central American Four Free Trade Agreement.

Once passed by the countries involved, tariffs on about 80% of U.S. exports to the participating countries were eliminated immediately and the rest were phased out over the subsequent decade. As a result, CAFTA-DR does not require substantial reductions in U.S. import duties with respect to the other countries, as the vast majority of goods produced in the participating countries already entered the United States duty-free due to the U.S. government&#x27;s Caribbean Basin Initiative.

With the addition of the Dominican Republic, the trade group&#x27;s largest economy, the region covered by CAFTA-DR is the second-largest Latin American export market for U.S. producers, behind only Mexico, buying $29  billion (~$ in ) of goods in 2015. Two-way trade amounted to about $50  billion in the same year.

While not necessarily a part of Plan Puebla Panama, CAFTA is a necessary precursor to the execution of Plan Puebla Panama by the Inter-American Development Bank. The plan includes construction of highways linking Panama City to Mexico City, Texas, and the rest of the United States.

CAFTA-DR reduces tariffs, but every CAFTA country sets its overall tax level.

In January 2002 U.S. president George W. Bush declared CAFTA as a priority and received &quot;fast track&quot; authority from Congress to negotiate it. Negotiations began in January 2003, and agreement was reached with El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua on December 17, 2003, and with Costa Rica on January 25, 2004. That same month, negotiations began with the Dominican Republic to join CAFTA.

On May 28, 2004, U.S. trade representative Robert Zoellick, Costa Rican minister of trade Alberto Trejos, Salvadoran economy minister Miguel Lacayo, Guatemalan economy minister Marcio Cuevas, Honduran minister of industry and commerce Norman García, and Nicaraguan minister of development, industry and commerce Mario Arana signed the 2,400-page document at headquarters of the Organization of American States. Negotiations with the Dominican Republic concluded on March 15, 2004, and a second signing ceremony including Dominican minister of industry and commerce Sonia Guzmán was held on August 5, 2004.

==Opposition==
In May 2004, the Salvadoran American National Network, the largest national association of Central American community-based organizations in the United States, expressed opposition to CAFTA, which they claimed was not ideologically motivated: &quot;As immigrants, we have a deep understanding of the potential benefits of improved transnational cooperation. We would welcome an agreement that would increase economic opportunity, protect our shared environment, guarantee workers&#x27; rights and acknowledge the role of human mobility in deepening the already profound ties between our countries. However, the CAFTA agreement falls far short of that vision.&quot;

While manufacturing costs of generic drugs are relatively cheap, the costs of human tests are relatively expensive, and tests take months or years. If generic manufacturers had to redo the tests, the generic drug would be more expensive, and generic manufacturers might not be able to do the tests at all. Furthermore, if generic manufacturers had to redo the tests, they would have to compare the new, effective drugs to less-effective drugs, which according to Doctors Without Borders, would be unethical. In the United States, drug manufacturers must make test data public for generic manufacturers. Under CAFTA&#x27;s test data exclusivity, drug manufacturers could keep test data secret, which would make it more difficult for local companies to produce generic drugs, and enable multinational pharmaceutical companies to keep a monopoly on branded drugs, including those used to treat AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.

In Guatemala mass protests were violently repressed by the government and strikes occurred in Costa Rica in opposition to the trade agreement. Furthermore, many Catholic bishops in Central America and the United States opposed the treaty, just as many social movements in the region.

==Provisions==

To create an FTA, governments pledge to grant market access to foreign firms by reducing and eventually eliminating tariffs and other measures that protect domestic products. To do so, the CAFTA-DR treaty stipulates national treatment and includes a most-favored nation clause. It also includes the protection of international property rights and requires from their signatories certain measures in the realm of transparency (e.g., parties are obligated to criminalize bribery in matters affecting international trade or investment). Moreover, the agreement includes i.a. chapters on investment, public procurement procedures, and financial services.

Antidumping and countervailing duty measures may not be challenged.

=== Cross-border trade in services ===

Each member country must treat service suppliers of another member country no less favorably than its own suppliers or those of any other member country. It requires firms to establish a local presence as a condition for supplying a service on a cross-border basis.

=== Financial services ===

CAFTA-DR imposes rules requiring member countries to treat service suppliers of another member country no less favorably than its own suppliers or those of any other country, prohibits certain quantitative restrictions on market access of financial institutions, and bars restrictions on the nationality of senior management.

=== Investment ===

CAFTA-DR establishes rules to protect investors from one member country against unfair or discriminatory government actions when they make or attempt to make investments in another member country&#x27;s territory. Investors enjoy six basic protections: 
# Non-discriminatory treatment relative to domestic investors as well as investors of non-parties; 
# Limits on &quot;performance requirements&quot;; 
# Free transfer of funds related to an investment; 
# Protection from expropriation other than in conformity with customary international law; 
# A &quot;minimum standard of treatment&quot; in conformity with customary international law; 
# The ability to hire key managerial personnel without regard to nationality.

=== Government procurement ===

Each member country must apply fair and transparent procurement procedures and rules and prohibiting each government and its procuring entities from discriminating in purchasing practices against goods, services, and suppliers from the other member countries.

=== Agriculture ===

CAFTA-DR requires that tariffs and quotas be administered in a manner that is transparent, nondiscriminatory, responsive to market conditions and minimally burdensome on trade and allows importers to fully utilize import quotas. Each member country will eliminate export subsidies on agricultural goods destined for another CAFTA-DR country.

=== Intellectual property rights ===

Member countries must ratify or accede to treaties governing intellectual property rights, such as the WIPO Copyright Treaty.

Each member country must provide:
* Protection for marks and geographical indications, including protecting preexisting trademarks against infringement by later geographical indications. 
* Efficient and transparent procedures governing the application for protection of marks and geographical indications. 
* Copyright protection for the life of the author plus 70 years (for works measured by a person&#x27;s life), or 70 years (for corporate works).

It also includes provisions on anticircumvention, under which member countries commit to prohibit tampering with digital rights management technology. Member countries agree to make patents available for any invention, subject to limited exclusions, and confirm the availability of patents for new uses or methods of using a known product. To guard against arbitrary revocation of patents, the grounds for revoking a patent must meet the high standard of not having merited the patent in the first place.

CAFTA-DR also ensures test data exclusivity for pharmaceutical corporations. It protects test data that a company submits in seeking marketing approval for such products by precluding other firms from relying on the data.

=== Dispute resolution ===

If a dispute over an actual or proposed national rule cannot be resolved after a 30-day consultation, the matter may be referred to a panel comprising independent experts that the parties select. Once the procedure before the panel is concluded, the panel will issue a report. The parties will attempt to resolve the dispute based on the panel&#x27;s report. If no amicable resolution is possible, the complaining party may suspend trade benefits equivalent in effect to those it considers were impaired, or may be impaired, as a result of the disputed measure. If a dispute arises under both CAFTA-DR and the WTO Agreement, the complaining party may choose either forum.

=== Political standards ===

CAFTA-DR contains certain provisions that do not have the quality of mere technical liberalization, but are rather a commitment to political standards. The treaty obligates governments to the enforcement of environmental laws and improvement of the environment. CAFTA-DR Environmental Cooperation Agreement, signed in concert with the FTA, provides for environmental cooperation on issues of mutual environmental concern. Furthermore, CAFTA-DR contains provisions for the enforcement of the International Labour Organization&#x27;s core labor standards.

<doc id="458976" wikidata="Q808606" url="?curid=458976" title="Baron Cromwell">
<text>Baron Cromwell is a title that has been created several times in the Peerage of England. The first creation, which was by writ, was for John de Cromwell in 1308. On his death, the barony became extinct. The second creation came in 1375 when Ralph de Cromwell was summoned by writ to Parliament as Lord Cromwell. His grandson, the third baron, served as Lord High Treasurer to King Henry VI. However, on his death in 1455, the barony fell into abeyance between his nieces Maude and Joan. On Joan&#x27;s death in 1490, the abeyance was terminated in favour of Maude, the fourth holder. When she died childless in 1497 the peerage once again fell into abeyance, this time between the daughters of the first baron. The title remained in abeyance for over 400 years. However, in 1922 the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords reported in favour of the petition for the termination of the abeyancy of Selina Frances Bewicke-Copley. She was the daughter of Sir Charles Watson Copley, 3rd Baronet, and one of the co-heirs of Maud, daughter of the first baron Cromwell. Selina died in 1923 and in July of the same year, the abeyance was terminated in favour of her son Robert Godfrey Wolesley Bewicke-Copley, who became the fifth baron. He notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire. the ancient barony is held by his grandson, the seventh baron, who succeeded his father in 1982. Having lost his seat in the House of Lords under the House of Lords Act 1999, in April 2014 he was elected at a hereditary peers&#x27; by-election as a Crossbencher.
The third creation of the title came in 1461 when Sir Humphrey Bourchier was summoned by writ to Parliament as Lord Cromwell. On his death the barony became extinct. The fourth creation of the title came in 1536 for the famous statesman Thomas Cromwell, who served in many political offices, including Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Chancellor, and Lord Privy Seal. In contrast to the three previous creations, this peerage was created by letters patent. In 1540, Lord Cromwell was made Earl of Essex, but later that year he was executed for treason, and all of his titles were forfeit. The final creation of the title came in 1540 for Cromwell&#x27;s son, Gregory, also by letters patent. His great-grandson, the fourth baron, was made Earl of Ardglass in 1645.

<text>The flag of the [[Central African Republic]] (; ) was officially adopted in 1958. It has been retained since that time with the same design, four horizontal stripes of blue, white, green and yellow, and a single vertical band of red, with a yellow five-pointed star in the upper left corner.

==Design==
The design consists of four horizontal stripes and one vertical stripe, and a single yellow five-pointed star in the upper left. The colours chosen are intended to be symbolic of France (blue and white) and Africa (green and yellow) with the red vertical stripe connecting them both in unity, and the respect that Europeans and Africans should have for each other. The yellow star is intended to be indicative of independence as well as a symbol of African unity, progress and tolerance The Constitution of the Central African Republic describes the flag as &quot;four equal sized horizontal bands of the colours blue, white, green and yellow, perpendicularly barred in their centre by a red band of equal size and marked in the upper left corner by a yellow five-pointed star.&quot;

==History==

The flag of the Central African Republic was designed by Barthélemy Boganda, who would become its first president. It was originally intended to be the flag of the United States of Latin Africa, which he proposed in 1957. The flag was adopted by the Legislative Assembly of Ubangi-Shari on 1 December 1958. At the time it was introduced, Boganda stated in the national Legislative Assembly that &quot;Those colours, which symbolize the four territories constituting the French Equatorial Africa but also our guide territory, the Metropolitan France, came out of my heart. The red stripe which crosses the four colours is the symbol of our blood. As we did it when France was in danger, we shall shed our blood for Africa and to protect the Central African Republic, member of the French Community.&quot;

President Jean-Bédel Bokassa considered the replacement of the flag in 1976, following his conversion to Islam under the influence of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. The proposal was to change the flag entirely in order to feature a crescent and star prominently. However, the proposal was short-lived, as several months later the Central African Empire was created under Bokassa, as Emperor Bokassa I. On 4 December that year, a Constitution described both the emblem for the Emperor&#x27;s personal use and the existing flag was re-used as that of the Empire. The personal standard of the Emperor was light green in color, with a gold-colored eagle in the centre superimposed over a 20-pointed gold star, inspired by the eagle on the imperial standard of Napoleon I.

The flag remained in place after the Central African Empire fell.

<text>The national [[Flag of Colombia|flag]] of [[Colombia]] symbolizes that the nation gained its independence from Spain on 20 July 1810. It is a unequal horizontal tricolor of yellow, blue and red in a 2:1:1 ratio. The yellow stripe takes up a half of the flag while the blue and red stripes take up a quarter of the space each.

==Symbolism and design==


The horizontal stripes (from top to bottom) of yellow, blue and red tricolor have a ratio of 2:1:1. The Colombian flag, the flag of Ecuador, and the flag of Venezuela are all derived from the flag of Gran Colombia. The stripes of the Colombian and Ecuadorian flags are different from most other tricolor flags because the three stripes are not equal sizes. By contrast, the flag of Venezuela is a more conventional tricolor due to its evenly sized stripes.

The official colors of the Colombian flag have not been established by law. The International Federation of Vexillological Associations recommends the following colors:
According to the government of Colombia, the colors represent:
* 

The flag&#x27;s colors have other representations, such as blue for loyalty and vigilance, red for the victory of battles for Colombian independence, and yellow for sovereignty and justice.

== History ==
Francisco de Miranda originally created the common yellow, blue, and red flag of Gran Colombia that Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, with slight variations, share today. Miranda gave at least two sources of inspiration for his flag. In a letter written to the Russian count Semyon Vorontsov and the German philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Miranda described a late-night conversation he had had with Goethe at a party in Weimar during the winter of 1785. Fascinated by Miranda&#x27;s account of his exploits in the United States Revolutionary War and his travels throughout the Americas and Europe, Goethe told him, &quot;Your destiny is to create in your land a place where primary colors are not distorted.&quot; He proceeded to clarify what he meant:

After Miranda designed his flag based on this conversation, he recalled seeing a fresco by Lazzaro Tavarone in the Palazzo Belimbau in Genoa that depicted Christopher Columbus unfurling a similar-colored flag in Veragua during his fourth voyage.

In his military diary, Miranda gave another possible source of inspiration: the yellow, blue and red standard of the Burger Guard (&quot;Bürgerwache&quot;) of Hamburg, which he also saw during his travels in Germany.

In the 1801 plan for an army to liberate Spanish America, which he submitted unsuccessfully to the British cabinet, Miranda requested the materials for &quot;ten flags, whose colors shall be red, yellow, and blue, in three zones.&quot; However, the first flag was not raised until 12 March 1806, in Jacmel, Haiti, during his ill-fated expedition to Venezuela.

<doc id="458981" wikidata="Q1157625" url="?curid=458981" title="Daimon">
<text>The daimon , spelled daimon or daemon (meaning &quot;god&quot;, &quot;godlike&quot;, &quot;power&quot;, &quot;fate&quot;), denotes an &quot;unknown superfactor&quot;, which can be either good or hostile.

In ancient Greek religion and mythology a daimon was imagined to be a lesser deity or guiding spirit. The word is derived from Proto-Indo-European &quot;daimon&quot; &quot;provider, divider (of fortunes or destinies),&quot; from the root &quot;*da-&quot; &quot;to divide&quot;. Daimons were possibly seen as the souls of men of the golden age, tutelary deities, or the forces of fate.

==Description==
Daimons are lesser divinities or spirits, often personifications of abstract concepts, beings of the same nature as both mortals and deities, similar to ghosts, chthonic heroes, spirit guides, forces of nature, or the deities themselves (see Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;). According to Hesiod&#x27;s myth, &quot;great and powerful figures were to be honoured after death as a daimon…&quot; A daimon is not so much a type of quasi-divine being, according to Walter Burkert, but rather a non-personified &quot;peculiar mode&quot; of their activity.

In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Phaëton becomes an incorporeal &quot;daimon&quot; or a divine spirit, but, for example, the ills released by Pandora are deadly deities, &quot;keres&quot;, not &quot;daimones&quot;. From Hesiod also, the people of the Golden Age were transformed into &quot;daimones&quot; by the will of Zeus, to serve mortals benevolently as their guardian spirits; &quot;good beings who dispense riches…[nevertheless], they remain invisible, known only by their acts&quot;. The &quot;daimones&quot; of venerated heroes were localized by the construction of shrines, so as not to wander restlessly, and were believed to confer protection and good fortune on those offering their respects.

One tradition of Greek thought, which found agreement in the mind of Plato, was of a daimon which existed within a person from their birth, and that each individual was obtained by a singular daimon prior to their birth by way of lot.

== In mythology ==

Homer&#x27;s use of the words &quot;theoí&quot; (, &quot;gods&quot;) and &quot;daímones&quot; () suggests that, while distinct, they are similar in kind. Later writers developed the distinction between the two. Plato in &quot;Cratylus&quot; speculates that the word &quot;daimōn&quot; (, &quot;deity&quot;) is synonymous to &quot;daēmōn&quot; (, &quot;knowing or wise&quot;); however, it is more probably &quot;daiō&quot; (, &quot;to divide, to distribute destinies, to allot&quot;).

===Socrates===

In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;, the priestess Diotima teaches Socrates that love is not a deity, but rather a &quot;great daimōn&quot; (202d). She goes on to explain that &quot;everything daimōnion is between divine and mortal&quot; (202d–e), and she describes daimōns as &quot;interpreting and transporting human things to the gods and divine things to men; entreaties and sacrifices from below, and ordinances and requitals from above...&quot; (202e). In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot;, Socrates claimed to have a &quot;daimōnion&quot; (literally, a &quot;divine something&quot;) that frequently warned him—in the form of a &quot;voice&quot;—against mistakes but never told him what to do. The Platonic Socrates, however, never refers to the &quot;daimonion&quot; as a &quot;daimōn&quot;; it was always referred to as an impersonal &quot;something&quot; or &quot;sign&quot;. By this term he seems to indicate the true nature of the human soul, his newfound self-consciousness. Paul Shorey sees the &quot;daimonion&quot; not as an inspiration but as &quot;a kind of &quot;spiritual tact&quot; checking Socrates from any act opposed to his true moral and intellectual interests.&quot;

Regarding the charge brought against Socrates in 399 BC, Plato surmised &quot;Socrates does wrong because he does not believe in the gods in whom the city believes, but introduces other daemonic beings...&quot; Burkert notes that &quot;a special being watches over each individual, a &quot;daimōn&quot; who has obtained the person at his birth by lot, is an idea which we find in Plato, undoubtedly from earlier tradition. The famous, paradoxical saying of Heraclitus is already directed against such a view: &#x27;character is for man his daimon.

==Categories==

The Hellenistic Greeks divided daemons into good and evil categories: &quot;agathodaímōn&quot; (, &quot;noble spirit&quot;), from &quot;agathós&quot; (, &quot;good, brave, noble, moral, lucky, useful&quot;), and &quot;kakodaímōn&quot; (, &quot;malevolent spirit&quot;), from &quot;kakós&quot; (, &quot;bad, evil&quot;). They resemble the Arabic jinni (or &quot;genie&quot;), and in their humble efforts to help mediate the good and ill fortunes of human life, they resemble the Christian guardian angel and adversarial demon, respectively. &quot;Eudaimonia&quot; () came to mean &quot;well-being&quot; or &quot;happiness&quot;. The comparable Roman concept is the &quot;genius&quot; who accompanies and protects a person or presides over a place (see &quot;genius loci&quot;).

A distorted view of Homer&#x27;s daemon results from an anachronistic reading in light of later characterizations by Plato and Xenocrates, his successor as head of the Academy, of the daemon as a potentially dangerous lesser spirit: Burkert states that in the &quot;Symposium&quot;, Plato has &quot;laid the foundation&quot; that would make it all but impossible to imagine the &quot;daimon&quot; in any other way with Eros, who is neither god nor mortal but a mediator in between, and his metaphysical doctrine of an &lt;poem&gt;incorporeal, pure actuality, &quot;energeia&quot; ... identical to its performance: ‘thinking of thinking’, &quot;noesis noeseos&quot; is the most blessed existence, the highest origin of everything. ‘This is the god. On such a principle heaven depends, and the cosmos.’ The highest, the best is one; but for the movement of the planets a plurality of unmoved movers must further be assumed.

In the monotheism of the mind, philosophical speculation has reached an end-point. That even this is a self-projection of a human, of the thinking philosopher, was not reflected on in ancient philosophy. In Plato there is an incipient tendency toward the apotheosis of &quot;nous&quot;. ... He needs a closeness and availability of the divine that is offered neither by the stars nor by metaphysical principles. Here a name emerged to fill the gap, a name which had always designated the incomprehensible yet present activity of a higher power, &quot;daimon&quot;.&lt;/poem&gt; Daemons scarcely figure in Greek mythology or Greek art: they are felt, but their unseen presence can only be presumed, with the exception of the &quot;agathodaemon&quot;, honored first with a libation in ceremonial wine-drinking, especially at the sanctuary of Dionysus, and represented in iconography by the chthonic serpent.

Burkert suggests that, for Plato, theology rests on two Forms: the Good and the Simple; which &quot;Xenocrates unequivocally called the unity god&quot; in sharp contrast to the poet&#x27;s gods of epic and tragedy. Although much like the deities, these figures were not always depicted without considerable moral ambiguity: &lt;poem&gt;On this account, the other traditional notion of the daemon as related to the souls of the dead is elided in favour of a spatial scenario which evidently also graduated in moral terms; though [Plato] says nothing of that here, it is a necessary inference from her account, just as Eros is midway between deficiency and plenitude. ... Indeed, Xenocrates ... explicitly understood &quot;daemones&quot; as ranged along a scale from good to bad. ... [Plutarch] speaks of ‘great and strong beings in the atmosphere, malevolent and morose, who rejoice in [unlucky days, religious festivals involving violence against the self, etc.], and after gaining them as their lot, they turn to nothing worse.’ ... The use of such malign daemones by human beings seems not to be even remotely imagined here: Xenocrates&#x27; intention was to provide an explanation for the sheer variety of polytheistic religious worship; but it is the potential for moral discrimination offered by the notion of &quot;daemones&quot; which later ... became one further means of conceptualizing what distinguishes dominated practice from civic religion, and furthering the transformation of that practice into intentional profanation ... Quite when the point was first made remains unanswerable. Much the same thought as [Plato&#x27;s] is to be found in an explicitly Pythagorean context of probably late Hellenistic composition, the &quot;Pythagorean Commentaries&quot;, which evidently draws on older popular representations: ‘The whole air is full of souls. We call them &quot;daemones&quot; and heroes, and it is they who send dreams, signs and illnesses to men; and not only men, but also to sheep and other domestic animals. It is towards these &quot;daemones&quot; that we direct purifications and apotropaic rites, all kinds of divination, the art of reading chance utterances, and so on.’ ... This account differs from that of the early Academy in reaching back to the other, Archaic, view of &quot;daemones&quot; as souls, and thus anticipates the views of Plutarch and Apuleius in the Principate ... It clearly implies that &quot;daemones&quot; can cause illness to livestock: this traditional dominated view has now reached the intellectuals.&lt;/poem&gt;

In the Archaic or early Classical period, the &quot;daimon&quot; had been democratized and internalized for each person, whom it served to guide, motivate, and inspire, as one possessed of such good spirits. Similarly, the first-century Roman imperial cult began by venerating the &quot;genius&quot; or &quot;numen&quot; of Augustus, a distinction that blurred in time.

<text>The national flag of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a sky blue flag, adorned with a yellow star in the upper left canton and cut diagonally by a red stripe with a yellow fimbriation. It was adopted on 18 February 2006. A new constitution, ratified in December 2005 and which came into effect in February 2006, promoted a return to a flag similar to that flown between 1966 and 1971, with a change from a royal blue to sky blue background. Blue represents peace. Red stands for &quot;the blood of the country&#x27;s martyrs&quot;, yellow the country&#x27;s wealth; and the star symbol the future for the country. 

During the period between 1971 and 1997 as Zaire, the flag consisted of a light green fabric with a yellow circle holding a flaming torch. 

It is one of the few national flags incorporating a diagonal line, with other examples including Tanzania, Namibia, Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Brunei.

==Colours==
The colours approximation is listed below:

==Previous flags==

The previous flag was adopted in 2003. It was similar to the flag used between 1960 and 1963. That flag, in turn, was based on the flag which was originally used by King Leopold&#x27;s Association Internationale Africaine and was first used in 1877. The 1877 design featured a yellow star on a blue background. The 1877 flag continued as the flag of the Congo Free State after the territory was recognized as an official possession of Leopold II at the Berlin Conference.

After gaining independence from Belgium on 30 June 1960, the same basic design was maintained. However, six smaller stars were added to the hoist to symbolise the six provinces of the country at the time. This design was used only from 1960 to 1963.

The flag of the second Republic of Mobutu Sese Seko became the official banner after Mobutu established his dictatorship. This flag was used from 1966 to 1971 and consisted of the same yellow star, now made smaller, situated in the top corner of the hoist side, with a red, yellow-lined band running diagonally across the center. The red symbolized the people&#x27;s blood; the yellow symbolized prosperity; the blue symbolized hope; and the star represented unity.

The flag changed again when the country was renamed Zaire in 1971. The Zairean flag used Pan-African colours and it featured a light green flag emblazoned with a yellow circle containing an arm holding a red torch which symbolised the spirit of revolution and the lives of dead revolutionaries. That flag had a central emblem which is that of the Popular Movement. The new flag was created as part of Mobutu&#x27;s attempted re-Africanization of the nation and was used officially until Mobutu&#x27;s overthrow in the First Congo War. The flag of Zaire was also used as the political-party flag of the Popular Movement of the Revolution, led by Mobutu. This flag was adopted by the New Zaire Government in Exile formed in 2017 and was displayed used during a failed coup attempt in May 2024.

In 1997, when the Mobutu government was overthrown and the country assumed its current designation of Democratic Republic of the Congo, the country reverted to 1960s post-independence design, featuring a single large star and six smaller stars. In 2003, the most recent change before the adoption of the current flag, the flag&#x27;s color was modified to use a lighter shade of blue.

<text>In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon ( or ) is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. Traditionally, the process names of a daemon end with the letter &quot;d&quot;, for clarification that the process is in fact a daemon, and for differentiation between a daemon and a normal computer program. For example, is a daemon that implements system logging facility, and is a daemon that serves incoming SSH connections.

In a Unix environment, the parent process of a daemon is often, but not always, the init process. A daemon is usually created either by a process forking a child process and then immediately exiting, thus causing init to adopt the child process, or by the init process directly launching the daemon. In addition, a daemon launched by forking and exiting typically must perform other operations, such as dissociating the process from any controlling terminal (tty). Such procedures are often implemented in various convenience routines such as &quot;daemon(3)&quot; in Unix.

Systems often start daemons at boot time that will respond to network requests, hardware activity, or other programs by performing some task. Daemons such as cron may also perform defined tasks at scheduled times.

==Terminology==
The term was coined by the programmers at MIT&#x27;s Project MAC. According to Fernando J. Corbató, who worked on Project MAC around 1963, his team was the first to use the term daemon, inspired by Maxwell&#x27;s demon, an imaginary agent in physics and thermodynamics that helped to sort molecules, stating, &quot;We fancifully began to use the word daemon to describe background processes that worked tirelessly to perform system chores&quot;. Unix systems inherited this terminology. Maxwell&#x27;s demon is consistent with Greek mythology&#x27;s interpretation of a daemon as a supernatural being working in the background.

In the general sense, daemon is an older form of the word &quot;demon&quot;, from the Greek δαίμων. In the &quot;Unix System Administration Handbook&quot; Evi Nemeth states the following about daemons:

In modern usage in the context of computer software, the word &quot;daemon&quot; is pronounced or .

Alternative terms for &quot;daemon&quot; are &quot;service&quot; (used in Windows, from Windows NT onwards, and later also in Linux), &quot;started task&quot; (IBM z/OS), and &quot;ghost job&quot; (XDS UTS). Sometimes the more general term &quot;server&quot; or &quot;server process&quot; is used, particularly for daemons that operate as part of client-server systems.

After the term was adopted for computer use, it was rationalized as a backronym for Disk And Execution MONitor.

Daemons that connect to a computer network are examples of network services.

==Implementations==

===Unix-like systems===
In a strictly technical sense, a Unix-like system process is a daemon when its parent process terminates and the daemon is assigned the init process (process number 1) as its parent process and has no controlling terminal. However, more generally, a daemon may be any background process, whether a child of the init process or not.

On a Unix-like system, the common method for a process to become a daemon, when the process is started from the command line or from a startup script such as an init script or a SystemStarter script, involves:
* Optionally removing unnecessary variables from environment.
* Executing as a background task by forking and exiting (in the parent &quot;half&quot; of the fork). This allows daemon&#x27;s parent (shell or startup process) to receive exit notification and continue its normal execution.
* Detaching from the invoking session, usually accomplished by a single operation, codice_1:
** Dissociating from the controlling tty.
** Creating a new session and becoming the session leader of that session.
** Becoming a process group leader.
* If the daemon wants to ensure that it will not acquire a new controlling tty even by accident (which happens when a session leader without a controlling tty opens a free tty), it may fork and exit again. This means that it is no longer a session leader in the new session, and cannot acquire a controlling tty.
* Setting the root directory () as the current working directory so that the process does not keep any directory in use that may be on a mounted file system (allowing it to be unmounted).
* Changing the umask to 0 to allow codice_2, codice_3, and other operating system calls to provide their own permission masks and not to depend on the umask of the caller.
* Redirecting file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 for the standard streams (stdin, stdout and stderr) to or a logfile, and closing all the other file descriptors inherited from the parent process.

If the process is started by a super-server daemon, such as , , or , the super-server daemon will perform those functions for the process, except for old-style daemons not converted to run under and specified as and &quot;multi-threaded&quot; datagram servers under .

===MS-DOS===
In the Microsoft DOS environment, daemon-like programs were implemented as terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSR).

===Windows NT===
On Microsoft Windows NT systems, programs called Windows services perform the functions of daemons. They run as processes, usually do not interact with the monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and may be launched by the operating system at boot time. In Windows 2000 and later versions, Windows services are configured and manually started and stopped using the Control Panel, a dedicated control/configuration program, the Service Controller component of the Service Control Manager ( command), the and commands or the PowerShell scripting system.

However, any Windows application can perform the role of a daemon, not just a service, and some Windows daemons have the option of running as a normal process.

===Classic Mac OS and macOS===
On the classic Mac OS, optional features and services were provided by files loaded at startup time that patched the operating system; these were known as system extensions and control panels. Later versions of classic Mac OS augmented these with fully fledged faceless background applications: regular applications that ran in the background. To the user, these were still described as regular system extensions.

macOS, which is a Unix system, uses daemons but uses the term &quot;services&quot; to designate software that performs functions selected from the Services menu, rather than using that term for daemons, as Windows does.

<doc id="458989" wikidata="Q163333" url="?curid=458989" title="Flag of the Republic of the Congo">
<text>The national flag of the Republic of the Congo () consists of a yellow diagonal band divided diagonally from the lower hoist-side corner, with a green upper triangle and red lower triangle. Adopted in 1959 to replace the French Tricolour, it was the flag of the Republic of the Congo until 1970, when the People&#x27;s Republic of the Congo was established. The new regime changed the flag to a red field with the coat of arms of the People&#x27;s Republic in the canton. This version was utilized until the regime collapsed in 1991. The new government promptly restored the original pre-1970 flag.
==History==
Under French colonial rule over French Congo, the authorities forbade the colony from utilizing its own distinctive colonial flag. This was because they were worried that this could increase nationalistic sentiment and lead to calls for independence. However, with the rise of the decolonization movement in Africa, the French were obliged to grant limited autonomy to the Congo as a self-governing republic within the French Community. This was granted on 28 November 1958, after a referendum was held and nine months later, the Legislative Assembly began deliberating over a national flag.

The new flag was officially adopted on 15 September 1959 and remained unchanged when the French Congo became an independent state less than a year later on 15 August 1960. It was hoisted on top of the building that formerly housed the French high commission to mark the proclamation of independence. In 1968, a coup d&#x27;état took place in the country, with the new government proclaiming the People&#x27;s Republic of the Congo a year later. By doing so, it became the first Marxist–Leninist country in Africa. In order to symbolize the revolutionary change, the regime instituted a new national anthem and chose a new flag. This featured a red field charged with the country&#x27;s new coat of arms—a gold star with an overlapping hammer and hoe encircled by a wreath made of two palm branches—in the top-left canton. The design was inspired by that of the Soviet Union&#x27;s flag.

The red flag remained in place until 1991, when economic problems and the weakening of the Soviet Union&#x27;s power due to the Revolutions of 1989 culminated in democratic elections and ultimately, the collapse of the People&#x27;s Republic of the Congo. The National Conference, which oversaw the transition to a democratic government, reinstated the original flag from 1959 on 10 June 1991. The colours and shapes on the flag are mentioned in Article 5 of the constitution of the Republic of the Congo.
==Design==

The colours of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The green symbolizes the agriculture and forests of the Congo, while the yellow represents the &quot;friendship and nobility&quot; of the Congolese people. However, the symbolism behind the red was left unexplained. From a continental viewpoint, the green, yellow and red are the colours of the Pan-Africanist movement; it is the only Pan-Africanist flag to utilize a diagonal pattern in its design. They are also 3 of the colors utilized in the flag of Ethiopia, the oldest independent country in Africa and the only nation other than Liberia to remain independent during the Scramble for Africa.

<text>Tulip festivals are held in several cities around the world, mostly in North America, usually in cities with a Dutch heritage such as Albany, New York; Ottawa, Ontario; Gatineau, Quebec; Montreal, Quebec; Holland, Michigan; Lehi, Utah; Orange City, Iowa; Pella, Iowa; Mount Vernon, Washington; and Woodburn, Oregon, and in other countries such as New Zealand, Australia, India, and England. The tulips are considered a welcome harbinger of spring, and a tulip festival permits residents to see them at their best advantage. The festivals are also popular tourist attractions. The tulips are displayed throughout the cities. In certain years the peak of tulips does not coincide with the actual festival due to climatic conditions.

The world&#x27;s largest tulip festival is held in Ottawa, Canada, with tulips sent by the Netherlands to commemorate the special relationship resulting from Canadian actions during World War II when Canadian forces led the liberation of the Netherlands and hosted the Dutch royal family in exile.

==Asia==
* Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India, celebrates Tulip Festival in the month of April in the Indira Gandhi Memorial Tulip Garden, situated over an area of 30 ha on the banks of world famous Dal Lake, considered to be the largest Tulip garden in Asia.
* Tonami, Toyama, Japan holds a tulip festival with over 2.5 million tulips in over 600 varieties. It takes place from late April to early May and is known as the &quot;Tonami Tulip Fair&quot; in Tonami Tulip Park.

*The Canadian Tulip Festival, which claims to be the world&#x27;s largest tulip festival, is a major event held annually each May in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. During World War II, the Dutch royal family took refuge in Canada. Princess Margriet of the Netherlands was born at Ottawa Civic Hospital in 1943, and the Canadian government declared the land to be extraterritorial. This was done to ensure that the princess would have solely Dutch citizenship. Furthermore, Canadian forces led the liberation of the Netherlands. Every year since, Queen Juliana and the royal family after her death, along with the Dutch Bulb Growers Association, have sent tulip bulbs for the festival to commemorate the special relationship.

===United States===

The tulip-festivals are being held in honour of the Dutch-American immigrants who brought the (then highly expensive) tulips to the Americas.

<doc id="458997" wikidata="Q170289" url="?curid=458997" title="Flag of Costa Rica">
<text>The national flag of [[Costa Rica]] () is based on a design created in 1848 and consists of two blue stripes, two white stripes, and a central red stripe which is twice as wide as each of the other four. The civil flag omits the coat of arms seen on the state flag, since the state variant is only permitted to be used by the government. 

The flag was officially adopted on 29 September 1848, with the only modifications since then being to the placement and design of the entrenched coat of arms on the state flag. The state variant of the flag has been updated to reflect concurrent modifications to the national coat of arms in 1906, 1964, and 1998.

==Colors==
==Symbolism==
The colors of the flag share the ideals of French Revolution of 1848: freedom, equality, and brotherhood. Blue means the sky, opportunities at reach, intellectual thinking, perseverance to accomplish a goal, infinite, eternity, and ideals of the religious and spiritual desires. White means clear thinking, happiness, wisdom, power and beauty of the sky, the driving force of initiatives to search for new endeavors, and the peace of Costa Rica. Red means “civilization of the century” and the sun casting on Costa Rica the “first rays of its true independence”, the warmth of Costa Rican people, their love to live, their bloodshed for freedom, and their generous attitude. The seven stars in the coat of arms represent the seven provinces of the republic.

==History==

During most of its colonial period, Costa Rica was the southernmost province of the Captaincy General of Guatemala, which was nominally part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (i.e., Mexico), but which in practice operated as a largely autonomous entity within the Spanish Empire. As such, the land of present Costa Rica was covered by the various flags of the Spanish Empire until 1823.

Costa Rica was part of the Federal Republic of Central America (originally known as the &quot;United Provinces of Central America&quot;), a sovereign state in Central America, which consisted of the territories of the former Captaincy General of Guatemala. A republican democracy, it existed from July 1823 to 1841. During this period, Costa Rica used the flag of the United Provinces of Central America, which took inspiration from the Argentinian flag. It was augmented by variations specific to the State of Costa Rica within the United Provinces of Central America (a blue and white striped United Provinces flag, with the Costa Rican State Seal added).

When the Federal Republic of Central America unofficially dissolved by 1841, Costa Rica based its flags on the Central American banner, although the 1840–42 version reversed the stripes to white-blue-white.

On 29 September 1848, a distinctive new design was created at the suggestion of Pacífica Fernández Oreamuno, wife of President José María Castro Madriz. An admirer of France (the scene of revolution in 1848), she recommended the addition of a red stripe to the flag.This basic flag has continued in use since that time. However, the coat of arms that appears on the flag used by the government was altered slightly in 1906 and 1934 and, most recently, on 21 October 1964.

<text>The flag of the State of Israel ( ; ) was adopted on 28 October 1948, five months after the Israeli Declaration of Independence. It consists of a white background with a blue Star of David in the centre and two horizontal blue stripes at the top and bottom, recalling the design of the tallit (). The Israeli flag legislation states that the official measurements are 160 × 220 cm. Therefore, the official proportions are 8:11. Variants can be found at a wide range of proportions, with 2:3 being common.

The blue color is described as &quot;dark sky-blue&quot;, and varies from flag to flag, ranging from a hue of pure blue, sometimes shaded almost as dark as navy blue, to hues about 75% toward pure cyan and shades as light as very light blue. An early version of the flag was displayed in 1885 at a procession marking the third anniversary of Rishon LeZion. A similar version was designed for the Zionist movement in 1891. The Star of David (, ), a Jewish symbol dating from late medieval-era Prague, was adopted by the First Zionist Congress in 1897.

==Origin of the flag==
In the Middle Ages, mystical powers were attributed to the pentagram and hexagram, which were used in talismans against evil spirits. Both were called the &quot;Seal of Solomon&quot;, but eventually the name became exclusive to the pentagram, while the hexagram became known as a &quot;Magen David&quot;, or &quot;Shield of David&quot;. Later the star began to appear in Jewish art. In 1648, Ferdinand II permitted the Jews of Prague to fly a &quot;Jewish flag&quot; over their synagogue. This flag was red with a yellow Magen David in the middle.

The idea that the blue and white colors were the national color of the Jewish people was voiced early on by Ludwig August von Frankl (1810–94), an Austrian Jewish poet. In his poem, &quot;Judah&#x27;s Colors&quot;, he writes:

In 1885, the agricultural village of used a blue and white flag incorporating a blue Star of David, designed by Israel Belkind and Fanny Abramovitch, in a procession marking its third anniversary. In 1891, Michael Halperin, one of the founders of the agricultural village flew a similar blue and white flag with a blue hexagram and the text &quot;&quot; (, &quot;a banner for Zion&quot;: a reference to , later adopted as the modern name of the city). A blue and white flag, with a Star of David and the Hebrew word &quot;Maccabee&quot;, was used in 1891 by the Bnai Zion Educational Society. Jacob Baruch Askowith (1844–1908) and his son Charles Askowith designed the &quot;flag of Judah&quot;, which was displayed on 24 July 1891, at the dedication of Zion Hall of the B&#x27;nai Zion Educational Society in Boston, Massachusetts. Based on the traditional , or Jewish prayer shawl, that flag was white with narrow blue stripes near the edges and bore in the center the ancient six-pointed Shield of David with the word &quot;Maccabee&quot; painted in blue Hebrew letters.
In Theodor Herzl&#x27;s 1896 , he stated: &quot;We have no flag, and we need one. If we desire to lead many men, we must raise a symbol above their heads. I would suggest a white flag, with seven golden stars. The white field symbolizes our pure new life; the stars are the seven golden hours of our working-day. For we shall march into the Promised Land carrying the badge of honour.&quot; Aware that the nascent Zionist movement had no official flag, David Wolffsohn (1856–1914), a prominent Zionist, felt that the design proposed by Herzl was not gaining significant support. Herzl&#x27;s original proposal however was for a flag completely devoid of any traditional Jewish symbolism: seven golden stars was representing the 7-hour workday of the enlightened state-to-be, which would have advanced socialist legislations. In preparing for the First Zionist Congress in Basel in 1897, Wolffsohn wrote: &quot;What flag would we hang in the Congress Hall? Then an idea struck me. We have a flag—and it is blue and white. The (prayer shawl) with which we wrap ourselves when we pray: that is our symbol. Let us take this from its bag and unroll it before the eyes of Israel and the eyes of all nations. So I ordered a blue and white flag with the Shield of David painted upon it. That is how the national flag, that flew over Congress Hall, came into being.&quot; Morris Harris, a member of New York , used his awning shop to design a suitable banner and decorations for the reception, and his mother Lena Harris sewed the flag. The flag was made with two blue stripes and a large blue Star of David in the center, the colors blue and white chosen from the design of the . The flag was ten feet by six feet—in the same proportions as the flag of the United States—and became known as the Flag of Zion. It was accepted as the official Zionist flag at the Second Zionist Congress held in Switzerland in 1898 and was flown with those of other nationalities at the World&#x27;s Fair hosting the 1904 Summer Olympics from one of the buildings at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition where large Zionist meetings were taking place. The racial Nuremberg Laws enacted by Nazi Germany in 1935 referenced the Zionist flag and stated that the Jews were forbidden to display the Reich and national flag or the German national colors but were permitted to display the &quot;Jewish colors&quot;.

In May 1948, the Provisional State Council asked the Israeli public to submit proposals for a flag and they received 164 entries. Initially the council had wished to abandon the traditional design of the Zionist flag and create something completely different in order to prevent Jews around the world being charged with dual loyalty when displaying the Zionist flag, which could create the impression they are flying the flag of a foreign country. On 14 October 1948, after Zionist representatives from around the world allayed the concerns of their Israeli colleagues, the flag of the Zionist Organization was adopted as the official flag of the State of Israel.

==Design==

The Provisional Council of State Proclamation of the Flag of the State of Israel states:
Although the stripes are described as a &quot;dark sky-blue&quot; and the Shield of David as simply &quot;sky-blue&quot;, the two elements of the flag are almost always the same shade.

===Colors===
In Hebrew, the blue is described as , which traditionally refers to a dark sky-blue dye identical to indigo, so identical in fact that supposedly only God could distinguish between the two, and which was extracted from a sea creature called a (almost certainly the banded dye-murex, from which a dye chemically identical to indigo can be extracted). Regardless, flags with vastly differing shades of blue are commonplace, such that it&#x27;s not uncommon for Israel&#x27;s national colors to be referred to as (“(dark) blue (and) white”) instead of (“(sky) blue (and) white”).

In 1950 a decision was made to set the standard color for government-regulated Israeli flags as &quot;Indanthren Calidon (GCDN)&quot;, while Israeli product labels are told to use CMYK 100/70/0/28.

====Interpretation of colors====

The blue stripes are intended to symbolize the stripes on a , the traditional Jewish prayer shawl. The Star of David is a widely acknowledged symbol of the Jewish people and of Judaism. In Judaism, the color blue symbolises God&#x27;s glory, purity and &quot;gevura&quot; (God&#x27;s severity). The White field represents &quot;hesed&quot; (Divine Benevolence). 

In the Bible, the Israelites are commanded to have one of the threads of their tassels () dyed with ; &quot;so that they may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the , and do them&quot; (). corresponds to the color of the divine revelation (Midrash Numbers Rabbah xv.). Sometime near the end of the Talmudic era (500–600 CE) the industry that produced this dye collapsed. It became rarer; over time, the Jewish community lost the tradition of which species of shellfish produced this dye. Since Jews were then unable to fulfil this commandment, they have since left their ( strings) white. However, in remembrance of the commandment to use the dye, it became common for Jews to have blue or purple stripes woven into the cloth of their .

==Criticism==
Israeli Arab criticism has been raised by the High Follow-Up Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel, which claims that Israel&#x27;s national symbols, including its flag, constitute an official bias towards the Jewish majority that reinforces the inequality between Arabs and Jews in Israel. 

Based on the boundaries of the Promised Land given in the Book of Genesis, Palestinians including Yasser Arafat and Hamas have claimed that the two blue stripes on the Israeli flag represent the Nile and Euphrates rivers and allege that Israel desires to eventually seize all the land in between. The Hamas Covenant states &quot;After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates,&quot; and in 2006, Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar issued a demand for Israel to change its flag, citing the &quot;Nile to Euphrates&quot; issue. Responding to these claims, Arab writer Saqr Abu Fakhr wrote that the &quot;Nile to Euphrates&quot; claim is a popular misconception about Jews that, despite being unfounded and having abundant evidence refuting them, continues to circulate in the Arab world.
Criticism from strictly Orthodox Jews stems back to their opposition of early Zionism when some went as far as banning the Star of David, originally a religious symbol, which had become &quot;defiled&quot; after being adopted by the World Zionist Organization. In a similar vein, contemporary leaders such as Rabbi Moses Feinstein called the Israeli flag &quot;a foolish and meaningless object&quot; discouraging its display in synagogues, while the Chazon Ish wrote that praying in a synagogue decorated with an Israeli flag should be avoided even if there was no other synagogue in the area. The former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel, Ovadia Yosef, also forbade the flying of the Israeli flag in synagogues, calling it &quot;a reminder of the acts of the evil-doers&quot; and Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum referred to the flag as the &quot;flag of heresy&quot; and viewed it as an object of idol worship. Despite the legal requirement (since 1997) for all government-funded schools to fly the Israeli flag, Haredi Jews generally refrain from displaying the flag at all, although in a rare symbolic gesture in gratitude to state funding, the Ponevezh Yeshiva raise the flag once a year on Independence Day. Some fringe groups who are theologically opposed to renewed Jewish sovereignty in the Holy Land resort to burning it on Independence Day. In 2019, a kosher sandwich shop in Lakewood Township, New Jersey that hung an Israeli flag on Israel&#x27;s Independence Day was threatened by its local kosher certification council with withdraw of certification.

==Notable flags==

* The &quot;Ink Flag&quot; of 1949, which was raised during the War of Independence near present-day Eilat. This homemade flag&#x27;s raising on a pole by several Israeli soldiers was immortalized in a photograph that has been compared with the famous photograph of the United States flag being raised atop Suribachi on the island of Iwo Jima in 1945. Like the latter photograph, the Ink Flag raising has also been reproduced as a memorial.
* The Israeli flag that stayed flying throughout the siege of Fort Budapest during the Yom Kippur War, which is currently preserved in the Israeli Armored Corps memorial at Latrun. Fort Budapest was the only strongpoint along the Bar-Lev Line to remain in Israeli hands during the war.
* The 2007 World Record Flag, which was unveiled at an airfield near the historic mountain fortress of Masada. The flag, manufactured in the Philippines, measured and weighed , breaking the previous record, measured and verified by representatives for the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;. It was made by Filipino entrepreneur and Evangelical Christian Grace Galindez-Gupana as a religious token and diplomatic gesture of support for Israel. In the Philippines, churches often display the Israeli flag. This record has since been surpassed several times.

<text>Golani Interchange (), known as Maskana Junction in Arabic, is a key road interchange in the Lower Galilee region of northern Israel, located east of Haifa and west of Tiberias, at the intersection of highways 65 and 77. The Golani Brigade Museum commemorating the Golani Brigade is situated there.

==History==
The previous at-grade intersection at Golani Junction experienced frequent traffic congestion on weekends and holidays when many Israelis travelled to the north of the country on vacation. Construction began in 2012 on an interchange to replace the former junction at a cost of NIS 300 million. The interchange opened for traffic in August 2013.

<doc id="459013" wikidata="Q179383" url="?curid=459013" title="Flag of Dominica">
<text>The national flag of Dominica was adopted on 3 November 1978, with some small changes having been made in 1981, 1988, and 1990. The original flag was designed by playwright Alwin Bully in early 1978 as the country prepared for independence.

It is one of the few flags of sovereign states to contain purple.

==History and design==
The flag, adopted in 1978, features the national bird emblem, the sisserou parrot (&quot;Amazona imperialis&quot;), which also appears on the coat of arms of Dominica as two supporters in the achievement, granted on 21 July 1961. This parrot, endemic to Dominica, is an endangered species with a population of only 250–350 individuals. 

The green field represents the lush vegetation of the island. The cross represents the Trinity and Christianity, with its three colours symbolising the natives, the fertile soil, and the pure water. The 10 green five-pointed stars stand for the country&#x27;s 10 parishes: (St Andrew, St David, St George, St John, St Joseph, St Luke, St Mark, St Patrick, St Paul, and St Peter), while the red disc stands for justice.

The sisserou parrot is sometimes coloured either blue or purple (the parrot&#x27;s actual colour). The use of purple makes the flag of Dominica one of the few flags of sovereign states to contain the colour.

The flag of Dominica, along with other national symbols, was the focus of a government-sponsored &quot;Emblems Week&quot; in 2016. An initiative of the independence committee, Emblems Week is aimed at reflecting on the meaning of the national emblems, and promoting their use among members of the general public and particularly among the country&#x27;s schools.

<text>In computer science, a pointer is an object in many programming languages that stores a memory address. This can be that of another value located in computer memory, or in some cases, that of memory-mapped computer hardware. A pointer &quot;references&quot; a location in memory, and obtaining the value stored at that location is known as &quot;dereferencing&quot; the pointer. As an analogy, a page number in a book&#x27;s index could be considered a pointer to the corresponding page; dereferencing such a pointer would be done by flipping to the page with the given page number and reading the text found on that page. The actual format and content of a pointer variable is dependent on the underlying computer architecture.

Using pointers significantly improves performance for repetitive operations, like traversing iterable data structures (e.g. strings, lookup tables, control tables, linked lists, and tree structures). In particular, it is often much cheaper in time and space to copy and dereference pointers than it is to copy and access the data to which the pointers point.

Pointers are also used to hold the addresses of entry points for called subroutines in procedural programming and for run-time linking to dynamic link libraries (DLLs). In object-oriented programming, pointers to functions are used for binding methods, often using virtual method tables.

A pointer is a simple, more concrete implementation of the more abstract &quot;reference&quot; data type. Several languages, especially low-level languages, support some type of pointer, although some have more restrictions on their use than others. While &quot;pointer&quot; has been used to refer to references in general, it more properly applies to data structures whose interface explicitly allows the pointer to be manipulated (arithmetically via &quot;&quot;) as a memory address, as opposed to a magic cookie or capability which does not allow such. Because pointers allow both protected and unprotected access to memory addresses, there are risks associated with using them, particularly in the latter case. Primitive pointers are often stored in a format similar to an integer; however, attempting to dereference or &quot;look up&quot; such a pointer whose value is not a valid memory address could cause a program to crash (or contain invalid data). To alleviate this potential problem, as a matter of type safety, pointers are considered a separate type parameterized by the type of data they point to, even if the underlying representation is an integer. Other measures may also be taken (such as validation and bounds checking), to verify that the pointer variable contains a value that is both a valid memory address and within the numerical range that the processor is capable of addressing.

==History==
In 1955, Soviet Ukrainian computer scientist Kateryna Yushchenko created the Address programming language that made possible indirect addressing and addresses of the highest rank – analogous to pointers. This language was widely used on the Soviet Union computers. However, it was unknown outside the Soviet Union and usually Harold Lawson is credited with the invention, in 1964, of the pointer. In 2000, Lawson was presented the Computer Pioneer Award by the IEEE &quot;[f]or inventing the pointer variable and introducing this concept into PL/I, thus providing for the first time, the capability to flexibly treat linked lists in a general-purpose high-level language&quot;. His seminal paper on the concepts appeared in the June 1967 issue of CACM entitled: PL/I List Processing. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word &quot;pointer&quot; first appeared in print as a &quot;stack pointer&quot; in a technical memorandum by the System Development Corporation.

==Formal description==
In computer science, a pointer is a kind of reference.

A &quot;data primitive&quot; (or just &quot;primitive&quot;) is any datum that can be read from or written to computer memory using one memory access (for instance, both a &quot;byte&quot; and a &quot;word&quot; are primitives).

A &quot;data aggregate&quot; (or just &quot;aggregate&quot;) is a group of primitives that are logically contiguous in memory and that are viewed collectively as one datum (for instance, an aggregate could be 3 logically contiguous bytes, the values of which represent the 3 coordinates of a point in space). When an aggregate is entirely composed of the same type of primitive, the aggregate may be called an &quot;array&quot;; in a sense, a multi-byte &quot;word&quot; primitive is an array of bytes, and some programs use words in this way.

A pointer is a programming concept used in computer science to reference or point to a memory location that stores a value or an object. It is essentially a variable that stores the memory address of another variable or data structure rather than storing the data itself.

Pointers are commonly used in programming languages that support direct memory manipulation, such as C and C++. They allow programmers to work with memory directly, enabling efficient memory management and more complex data structures. By using pointers, you can access and modify data located in memory, pass data efficiently between functions, and create dynamic data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs.

In simpler terms, you can think of a pointer as an arrow that points to a specific spot in a computer&#x27;s memory, allowing you to interact with the data stored at that location.

A &quot;memory pointer&quot; (or just &quot;pointer&quot;) is a primitive, the value of which is intended to be used as a memory address; it is said that &quot;a pointer points to a memory address&quot;. It is also said that &quot;a pointer points to a datum [in memory]&quot; when the pointer&#x27;s value is the datum&#x27;s memory address.

More generally, a pointer is a kind of reference, and it is said that &quot;a pointer references a datum stored somewhere in memory&quot;; to obtain that datum is &quot;to dereference the pointer&quot;. The feature that separates pointers from other kinds of reference is that a pointer&#x27;s value is meant to be interpreted as a memory address, which is a rather low-level concept.

References serve as a level of indirection: A pointer&#x27;s value determines which memory address (that is, which datum) is to be used in a calculation. Because indirection is a fundamental aspect of algorithms, pointers are often expressed as a fundamental data type in programming languages; in statically (or strongly) typed programming languages, the type of a pointer determines the type of the datum to which the pointer points.

==Architectural roots==
Pointers are a very thin abstraction on top of the addressing capabilities provided by most modern architectures. In the simplest scheme, an &quot;address&quot;, or a numeric index, is assigned to each unit of memory in the system, where the unit is typically either a byte or a word – depending on whether the architecture is byte-addressable or word-addressable – effectively transforming all of memory into a very large array. The system would then also provide an operation to retrieve the value stored in the memory unit at a given address (usually utilizing the machine&#x27;s general-purpose registers).

In the usual case, a pointer is large enough to hold more addresses than there are units of memory in the system. This introduces the possibility that a program may attempt to access an address which corresponds to no unit of memory, either because not enough memory is installed (i.e. beyond the range of available memory) or the architecture does not support such addresses. The first case may, in certain platforms such as the Intel x86 architecture, be called a segmentation fault (segfault). The second case is possible in the current implementation of AMD64, where pointers are 64 bit long and addresses only extend to 48 bits. Pointers must conform to certain rules (canonical addresses), so if a non-canonical pointer is dereferenced, the processor raises a general protection fault.

On the other hand, some systems have more units of memory than there are addresses. In this case, a more complex scheme such as memory segmentation or paging is employed to use different parts of the memory at different times. The last incarnations of the x86 architecture support up to 36 bits of physical memory addresses, which were mapped to the 32-bit linear address space through the PAE paging mechanism. Thus, only 1/16 of the possible total memory may be accessed at a time. Another example in the same computer family was the 16-bit protected mode of the 80286 processor, which, though supporting only 16 MB of physical memory, could access up to 1 GB of virtual memory, but the combination of 16-bit address and segment registers made accessing more than 64 KB in one data structure cumbersome.

In order to provide a consistent interface, some architectures provide memory-mapped I/O, which allows some addresses to refer to units of memory while others refer to device registers of other devices in the computer. There are analogous concepts such as file offsets, array indices, and remote object references that serve some of the same purposes as addresses for other types of objects.

==Uses==
Pointers are directly supported without restrictions in languages such as PL/I, C, C++, Pascal, FreeBASIC, and implicitly in most assembly languages. They are used mainly to construct references, which in turn are fundamental to construct nearly all data structures, and to pass data between different parts of a program.

In functional programming languages that rely heavily on lists, data references are managed abstractly by using primitive constructs like cons and the corresponding elements car and cdr, which can be thought of as specialised pointers to the first and second components of a cons-cell. This gives rise to some of the idiomatic &quot;flavour&quot; of functional programming. By structuring data in such cons-lists, these languages facilitate recursive means for building and processing data—for example, by recursively accessing the head and tail elements of lists of lists; e.g. &quot;taking the car of the cdr of the cdr&quot;. By contrast, memory management based on pointer dereferencing in some approximation of an array of memory addresses facilitates treating variables as slots into which data can be assigned imperatively.

When dealing with arrays, the critical lookup operation typically involves a stage called &quot;address calculation&quot; which involves constructing a pointer to the desired data element in the array. In other data structures, such as linked lists, pointers are used as references to explicitly tie one piece of the structure to another.

Pointers are used to pass parameters by reference. This is useful if the programmer wants a function&#x27;s modifications to a parameter to be visible to the function&#x27;s caller. This is also useful for returning multiple values from a function.

Pointers can also be used to allocate and deallocate dynamic variables and arrays in memory. Since a variable will often become redundant after it has served its purpose, it is a waste of memory to keep it, and therefore it is good practice to deallocate it (using the original pointer reference) when it is no longer needed. Failure to do so may result in a &quot;memory leak&quot; (where available free memory gradually, or in severe cases rapidly, diminishes because of an accumulation of numerous redundant memory blocks).

===C pointers===
The basic syntax to define a pointer is:

int *ptr;

This declares codice_1 as the identifier of an object of the following type:
* pointer that points to an object of type codice_2
This is usually stated more succinctly as &quot;codice_1 is a pointer to codice_2.&quot;

Because the C language does not specify an implicit initialization for objects of automatic storage duration, care should often be taken to ensure that the address to which codice_1 points is valid; this is why it is sometimes suggested that a pointer be explicitly initialized to the null pointer value, which is traditionally specified in C with the standardized macro codice_6:

int *ptr = NULL;

Dereferencing a null pointer in C produces undefined behavior, which could be catastrophic. However, most implementations simply halt execution of the program in question, usually with a segmentation fault.

However, initializing pointers unnecessarily could hinder program analysis, thereby hiding bugs.

In any case, once a pointer has been declared, the next logical step is for it to point at something:
int a = 5;
int *ptr = NULL;

ptr = &amp;a;
This assigns the value of the address of codice_7 to codice_1. For example, if codice_7 is stored at memory location of 0x8130 then the value of codice_1 will be 0x8130 after the assignment. To dereference the pointer, an asterisk is used again:

*ptr = 8;

This means take the contents of codice_1 (which is 0x8130), &quot;locate&quot; that address in memory and set its value to 8.
If codice_7 is later accessed again, its new value will be 8.

This example may be clearer if memory is examined directly.
Assume that codice_7 is located at address 0x8130 in memory and codice_1 at 0x8134; also assume this is a 32-bit machine such that an int is 32-bits wide. The following is what would be in memory after the following code snippet is executed:
int a = 5;
int *ptr = NULL;


(The NULL pointer shown here is 0x00000000.)
By assigning the address of codice_7 to codice_1:

ptr = &amp;a;

yields the following memory values:

Then by dereferencing codice_1 by coding:

*ptr = 8;

the computer will take the contents of codice_1 (which is 0x8130), &#x27;locate&#x27; that address, and assign 8 to that location yielding the following memory:

Clearly, accessing codice_7 will yield the value of 8 because the previous instruction modified the contents of codice_7 by way of the pointer codice_1.

===Use in data structures===
When setting up data structures like lists, queues and trees, it is necessary to have pointers to help manage how the structure is implemented and controlled. Typical examples of pointers are start pointers, end pointers, and stack pointers. These pointers can either be absolute (the actual physical address or a virtual address in virtual memory) or relative (an offset from an absolute start address (&quot;base&quot;) that typically uses fewer bits than a full address, but will usually require one additional arithmetic operation to resolve).

Relative addresses are a form of manual memory segmentation, and share many of its advantages and disadvantages. A two-byte offset, containing a 16-bit, unsigned integer, can be used to provide relative addressing for up to 64 KiB (216 bytes) of a data structure. This can easily be extended to 128, 256 or 512 KiB if the address pointed to is forced to be aligned on a half-word, word or double-word boundary (but, requiring an additional &quot;shift left&quot; bitwise operation—by 1, 2 or 3 bits—in order to adjust the offset by a factor of 2, 4 or 8, before its addition to the base address). Generally, though, such schemes are a lot of trouble, and for convenience to the programmer absolute addresses (and underlying that, a &quot;flat address space&quot;) is preferred.

A one byte offset, such as the hexadecimal ASCII value of a character (e.g. X&#x27;29&#x27;) can be used to point to an alternative integer value (or index) in an array (e.g., X&#x27;01&#x27;). In this way, characters can be very efficiently translated from &#x27;raw data&#x27; to a usable sequential index and then to an absolute address without a lookup table.

====C arrays====
In C, array indexing is formally defined in terms of pointer arithmetic; that is, the language specification requires that codice_22 be equivalent to codice_23. Thus in C, arrays can be thought of as pointers to consecutive areas of memory (with no gaps), and the syntax for accessing arrays is identical for that which can be used to dereference pointers. For example, an array codice_24 can be declared and used in the following manner:
int array[5]; /* Declares 5 contiguous integers */
int *ptr = array; /* Arrays can be used as pointers */
ptr[0] = 1; /* Pointers can be indexed with array syntax */
*(array + 1) = 2; /* Arrays can be dereferenced with pointer syntax */
*(1 + array) = 2; /* Pointer addition is commutative */
2[array] = 4; /* Subscript operator is commutative */
This allocates a block of five integers and names the block codice_24, which acts as a pointer to the block. Another common use of pointers is to point to dynamically allocated memory from malloc which returns a consecutive block of memory of no less than the requested size that can be used as an array.

While most operators on arrays and pointers are equivalent, the result of the codice_26 operator differs. In this example, codice_27 will evaluate to codice_28 (the size of the array), while codice_29 will evaluate to codice_30, the size of the pointer itself.

Default values of an array can be declared like:
int array[5] = {2, 4, 3, 1, 5};
If codice_24 is located in memory starting at address 0x1000 on a 32-bit little-endian machine then memory will contain the following (values are in hexadecimal, like the addresses):
Represented here are five integers: 2, 4, 3, 1, and 5. These five integers occupy 32 bits (4 bytes) each with the least-significant byte stored first (this is a little-endian CPU architecture) and are stored consecutively starting at address 0x1000.

The syntax for C with pointers is:
* codice_24 means 0x1000;
* codice_33 means 0x1004: the &quot;+ 1&quot; means to add the size of 1 codice_2, which is 4 bytes;
* codice_35 means to dereference the contents of codice_24. Considering the contents as a memory address (0x1000), look up the value at that location (0x0002);
* codice_22 means element number codice_38, 0-based, of codice_24 which is translated into codice_23.

The last example is how to access the contents of codice_24. Breaking it down:
* codice_42 is the memory location of the (i)th element of codice_24, starting at i=0;
* codice_23 takes that memory address and dereferences it to access the value.

====C linked list====
Below is an example definition of a linked list in C.
/* the empty linked list is represented by NULL
 * or some other sentinel value */
#define EMPTY_LIST NULL

struct link {
 void *data; /* data of this link */
 struct link *next; /* next link; EMPTY_LIST if there is none */


This pointer-recursive definition is essentially the same as the reference-recursive definition from the language Haskell:
 data Link a = Nil
 | Cons a (Link a)

codice_45 is the empty list, and codice_46 is a cons cell of type codice_7 with another link also of type codice_7.

The definition with references, however, is type-checked and does not use potentially confusing signal values. For this reason, data structures in C are usually dealt with via wrapper functions, which are carefully checked for correctness.

===Pass-by-address using pointers===
Pointers can be used to pass variables by their address, allowing their value to be changed. For example, consider the following C code:
/* a copy of the int n can be changed within the function without affecting the calling code */
void passByValue(int n) {
 n = 12;

/* a pointer m is passed instead. No copy of the value pointed to by m is created */
void passByAddress(int *m) {
 *m = 14;

int main(void) {
 int x = 3;

 /* pass a copy of x&#x27;s value as the argument */
 passByValue(x);
 // the value was changed inside the function, but x is still 3 from here on

 /* pass x&#x27;s address as the argument */
 passByAddress(&amp;x);
 // x was actually changed by the function and is now equal to 14 here

 return 0;


===Dynamic memory allocation===
In some programs, the required amount of memory depends on what &quot;the user&quot; may enter. In such cases the programmer needs to allocate memory dynamically. This is done by allocating memory at the &quot;heap&quot; rather than on the &quot;stack&quot;, where variables usually are stored (although variables can also be stored in the CPU registers). Dynamic memory allocation can only be made through pointers, and names – like with common variables – cannot be given.

Pointers are used to store and manage the addresses of dynamically allocated blocks of memory. Such blocks are used to store data objects or arrays of objects. Most structured and object-oriented languages provide an area of memory, called the &quot;heap&quot; or &quot;free store&quot;, from which objects are dynamically allocated.

The example C code below illustrates how structure objects are dynamically allocated and referenced. The standard C library provides the function codice_49 for allocating memory blocks from the heap. It takes the size of an object to allocate as a parameter and returns a pointer to a newly allocated block of memory suitable for storing the object, or it returns a null pointer if the allocation failed.
/* Parts inventory item */
struct Item {
 int id; /* Part number */
 char * name; /* Part name */
 float cost; /* Cost */

/* Allocate and initialize a new Item object */
struct Item * make_item(const char *name) {
 struct Item * item;

 /* Allocate a block of memory for a new Item object */
 item = malloc(sizeof(struct Item));
 if (item == NULL)
 return NULL;

 /* Initialize the members of the new Item */
 memset(item, 0, sizeof(struct Item));
 item-&gt;id = -1;
 item-&gt;name = NULL;
 item-&gt;cost = 0.0;

 /* Save a copy of the name in the new Item */
 item-&gt;name = malloc(strlen(name) + 1);
 if (item-&gt;name == NULL) {
 free(item);
 return NULL;
 strcpy(item-&gt;name, name);

 /* Return the newly created Item object */
 return item;


The code below illustrates how memory objects are dynamically deallocated, i.e., returned to the heap or free store. The standard C library provides the function codice_50 for deallocating a previously allocated memory block and returning it back to the heap.
/* Deallocate an Item object */
void destroy_item(struct Item *item) {
 /* Check for a null object pointer */
 if (item == NULL)
 return;

 /* Deallocate the name string saved within the Item */
 if (item-&gt;name != NULL) {
 free(item-&gt;name);
 item-&gt;name = NULL;

 /* Deallocate the Item object itself */
 free(item);


===Memory-mapped hardware===
On some computing architectures, pointers can be used to directly manipulate memory or memory-mapped devices.

Assigning addresses to pointers is an invaluable tool when programming microcontrollers. Below is a simple example declaring a pointer of type int and initialising it to a hexadecimal address in this example the constant 0x7FFF:
int *hardware_address = (int *)0x7FFF;
In the mid 80s, using the BIOS to access the video capabilities of PCs was slow. Applications that were display-intensive typically used to access CGA video memory directly by casting the hexadecimal constant 0xB8000 to a pointer to an array of 80 unsigned 16-bit int values. Each value consisted of an ASCII code in the low byte, and a colour in the high byte. Thus, to put the letter &#x27;A&#x27; at row 5, column 2 in bright white on blue, one would write code like the following:
#define VID ((unsigned short (*)[80])0xB8000)

void foo(void) {
 VID[4][1] = 0x1F00 | &#x27;A&#x27;;


===Use in control tables===

Control tables that are used to control program flow usually make extensive use of pointers. The pointers, usually embedded in a table entry, may, for instance, be used to hold the entry points to subroutines to be executed, based on certain conditions defined in the same table entry. The pointers can however be simply indexes to other separate, but associated, tables comprising an array of the actual addresses or the addresses themselves (depending upon the programming language constructs available). They can also be used to point to earlier table entries (as in loop processing) or forward to skip some table entries (as in a switch or &quot;early&quot; exit from a loop). For this latter purpose, the &quot;pointer&quot; may simply be the table entry number itself and can be transformed into an actual address by simple arithmetic.

==Typed pointers and casting==
In many languages, pointers have the additional restriction that the object they point to has a specific type. For example, a pointer may be declared to point to an integer; the language will then attempt to prevent the programmer from pointing it to objects which are not integers, such as floating-point numbers, eliminating some errors.

For example, in C
int *money;
char *bags;
codice_51 would be an integer pointer and codice_52 would be a char pointer.
The following would yield a compiler warning of &quot;assignment from incompatible pointer type&quot; under GCC
bags = money;
because codice_51 and codice_52 were declared with different types.
To suppress the compiler warning, it must be made explicit that you do indeed wish to make the assignment by typecasting it
bags = (char *)money;
which says to cast the integer pointer of codice_51 to a char pointer and assign to codice_52.

A 2005 draft of the C standard requires that casting a pointer derived from one type to one of another type should maintain the alignment correctness for both types (6.3.2.3 Pointers, par. 7):

char *external_buffer = &quot;abcdef&quot;;
int *internal_data;

internal_data = (int *)external_buffer; // UNDEFINED BEHAVIOUR if &quot;the resulting pointer
 // is not correctly aligned&quot;
In languages that allow pointer arithmetic, arithmetic on pointers takes into account the size of the type. For example, adding an integer number to a pointer produces another pointer that points to an address that is higher by that number times the size of the type. This allows us to easily compute the address of elements of an array of a given type, as was shown in the C arrays example above. When a pointer of one type is cast to another type of a different size, the programmer should expect that pointer arithmetic will be calculated differently. In C, for example, if the codice_51 array starts at 0x2000 and codice_58 is 4 bytes whereas codice_59 is 1 byte, then codice_60 will point to 0x2004, but codice_61 would point to 0x2001. Other risks of casting include loss of data when &quot;wide&quot; data is written to &quot;narrow&quot; locations (e.g. codice_62), unexpected results when bit-shifting values, and comparison problems, especially with signed vs unsigned values.

Although it is impossible in general to determine at compile-time which casts are safe, some languages store run-time type information which can be used to confirm that these dangerous casts are valid at runtime. Other languages merely accept a conservative approximation of safe casts, or none at all.

=== Value of pointers ===
In C and C++, even if two pointers compare as equal that doesn&#x27;t mean they are equivalent. In these languages &quot;and&quot; LLVM, the rule is interpreted to mean that &quot;just because two pointers point to the same address, does not mean they are equal in the sense that they can be used interchangeably&quot;, the difference between the pointers referred to as their &quot;provenance&quot;. Casting to an integer type such as codice_63 is implementation-defined and the comparison it provides does not provide any more insight as to whether the two pointers are interchangeable. In addition, further conversion to bytes and arithmetic will throw off optimizers trying to keep track the use of pointers, a problem still being elucidated in academic research.

==Making pointers safer==
As a pointer allows a program to attempt to access an object that may not be defined, pointers can be the origin of a variety of programming errors. However, the usefulness of pointers is so great that it can be difficult to perform programming tasks without them. Consequently, many languages have created constructs designed to provide some of the useful features of pointers without some of their pitfalls, also sometimes referred to as &quot;pointer hazards&quot;. In this context, pointers that directly address memory (as used in this article) are referred to as s, by contrast with smart pointers or other variants.

One major problem with pointers is that as long as they can be directly manipulated as a number, they can be made to point to unused addresses or to data which is being used for other purposes. Many languages, including most functional programming languages and recent imperative programming languages like Java, replace pointers with a more opaque type of reference, typically referred to as simply a &quot;reference&quot;, which can only be used to refer to objects and not manipulated as numbers, preventing this type of error. Array indexing is handled as a special case.

A pointer which does not have any address assigned to it is called a wild pointer. Any attempt to use such uninitialized pointers can cause unexpected behavior, either because the initial value is not a valid address, or because using it may damage other parts of the program. The result is often a segmentation fault, storage violation or wild branch (if used as a function pointer or branch address).

In systems with explicit memory allocation, it is possible to create a dangling pointer by deallocating the memory region it points into. This type of pointer is dangerous and subtle because a deallocated memory region may contain the same data as it did before it was deallocated but may be then reallocated and overwritten by unrelated code, unknown to the earlier code. Languages with garbage collection prevent this type of error because deallocation is performed automatically when there are no more references in scope.

Some languages, like C++, support smart pointers, which use a simple form of reference counting to help track allocation of dynamic memory in addition to acting as a reference. In the absence of reference cycles, where an object refers to itself indirectly through a sequence of smart pointers, these eliminate the possibility of dangling pointers and memory leaks. Delphi strings support reference counting natively.

The Rust programming language introduces a &quot;borrow checker&quot;, &quot;pointer lifetimes&quot;, and an optimisation based around option types for null pointers to eliminate pointer bugs, without resorting to garbage collection.

== Special kinds of pointers ==

=== Kinds defined by value ===
====Null pointer====

A null pointer has a value reserved for indicating that the pointer does not refer to a valid object. Null pointers are routinely used to represent conditions such as the end of a list of unknown length or the failure to perform some action; this use of null pointers can be compared to nullable types and to the &quot;Nothing&quot; value in an option type.

====Dangling pointer====

A dangling pointer is a pointer that does not point to a valid object and consequently may make a program crash or behave oddly. In the Pascal or C programming languages, pointers that are not specifically initialized may point to unpredictable addresses in memory.

The following example code shows a dangling pointer:
int func(void) {
 char *p1 = malloc(sizeof(char)); /* (undefined) value of some place on the heap */
 char *p2; /* dangling (uninitialized) pointer */
 *p1 = &#x27;a&#x27;; /* This is OK, assuming malloc() has not returned NULL. */
 *p2 = &#x27;b&#x27;; /* This invokes undefined behavior */


Here, codice_64 may point to anywhere in memory, so performing the assignment codice_65 can corrupt an unknown area of memory or trigger a segmentation fault.

====Wild branch====
Where a pointer is used as the address of the entry point to a program or start of a function which doesn&#x27;t return anything and is also either uninitialized or corrupted, if a call or jump is nevertheless made to this address, a &quot;wild branch&quot; is said to have occurred. In other words, a wild branch is a function pointer that is wild (dangling).

The consequences are usually unpredictable and the error may present itself in several different ways depending upon whether or not the pointer is a &quot;valid&quot; address and whether or not there is (coincidentally) a valid instruction (opcode) at that address. The detection of a wild branch can present one of the most difficult and frustrating debugging exercises since much of the evidence may already have been destroyed beforehand or by execution of one or more inappropriate instructions at the branch location. If available, an instruction set simulator can usually not only detect a wild branch before it takes effect, but also provide a complete or partial trace of its history.

=== Kinds defined by structure ===

==== Autorelative pointer ====
An autorelative pointer is a pointer whose value is interpreted as an offset from the address of the pointer itself; thus, if a data structure has an autorelative pointer member that points to some portion of the data structure itself, then the data structure may be relocated in memory without having to update the value of the auto relative pointer.

The cited patent also uses the term self-relative pointer to mean the same thing. However, the meaning of that term has been used in other ways:
* to mean an offset from the address of a structure rather than from the address of the pointer itself;
* to mean a pointer containing its own address, which can be useful for reconstructing in any arbitrary region of memory a collection of data structures that point to each other.

==== Based pointer ====
A based pointer is a pointer whose value is an offset from the value of another pointer. This can be used to store and load blocks of data, assigning the address of the beginning of the block to the base pointer.

=== Kinds defined by use or datatype ===

====Multiple indirection====
In some languages, a pointer can reference another pointer, requiring multiple dereference operations to get to the original value. While each level of indirection may add a performance cost, it is sometimes necessary in order to provide correct behavior for complex data structures. For example, in C it is typical to define a linked list in terms of an element that contains a pointer to the next element of the list:
struct element {
 struct element *next;
 int value;

struct element *head = NULL;
This implementation uses a pointer to the first element in the list as a surrogate for the entire list. If a new value is added to the beginning of the list, codice_66 has to be changed to point to the new element. Since C arguments are always passed by value, using double indirection allows the insertion to be implemented correctly, and has the desirable side-effect of eliminating special case code to deal with insertions at the front of the list:
// Given a sorted list at *head, insert the element item at the first
// location where all earlier elements have lesser or equal value.
void insert(struct element **head, struct element *item) {
 struct element **p; // p points to a pointer to an element
 for (p = head; *p != NULL; p = &amp;(*p)-&gt;next) {
 if (item-&gt;value &lt;= (*p)-&gt;value)
 break;
 item-&gt;next = *p;
 *p = item;

// Caller does this:
insert(&amp;head, item);
In this case, if the value of codice_67 is less than that of codice_66, the caller&#x27;s codice_66 is properly updated to the address of the new item.

A basic example is in the argv argument to the main function in C (and C++), which is given in the prototype as codice_70—this is because the variable codice_71 itself is a pointer to an array of strings (an array of arrays), so codice_72 is a pointer to the 0th string (by convention the name of the program), and codice_73 is the 0th character of the 0th string.

====Function pointer====
In some languages, a pointer can reference executable code, i.e., it can point to a function, method, or procedure. A function pointer will store the address of a function to be invoked. While this facility can be used to call functions dynamically, it is often a favorite technique of virus and other malicious software writers.
int sum(int n1, int n2) { // Function with two integer parameters returning an integer value
 return n1 + n2;

int main(void) {
 int a, b, x, y;
 int (*fp)(int, int); // Function pointer which can point to a function like sum
 fp = &amp;sum; // fp now points to function sum
 x = (*fp)(a, b); // Calls function sum with arguments a and b
 y = sum(a, b); // Calls function sum with arguments a and b


====Back pointer====
In doubly linked lists or tree structures, a back pointer held on an element &#x27;points back&#x27; to the item referring to the current element. These are useful for navigation and manipulation, at the expense of greater memory use.

==Simulation using an array index==
It is possible to simulate pointer behavior using an index to an (normally one-dimensional) array.

Primarily for languages which do not support pointers explicitly but &quot;do&quot; support arrays, the array can be thought of and processed as if it were the entire memory range (within the scope of the particular array) and any index to it can be thought of as equivalent to a general-purpose register in assembly language (that points to the individual bytes but whose actual value is relative to the start of the array, not its absolute address in memory).
Assuming the array is, say, a contiguous 16 megabyte character data structure, individual bytes (or a string of contiguous bytes within the array) can be directly addressed and manipulated using the name of the array with a 31 bit unsigned integer as the simulated pointer (this is quite similar to the &quot;C arrays&quot; example shown above). Pointer arithmetic can be simulated by adding or subtracting from the index, with minimal additional overhead compared to genuine pointer arithmetic.

It is even theoretically possible, using the above technique, together with a suitable instruction set simulator to simulate &quot;any&quot; machine code or the intermediate (byte code) of &quot;any&quot; processor/language in another language that does not support pointers at all (for example Java / JavaScript). To achieve this, the binary code can initially be loaded into contiguous bytes of the array for the simulator to &quot;read&quot;, interpret and execute entirely within the memory containing the same array.
If necessary, to completely avoid buffer overflow problems, bounds checking can usually be inserted by the compiler (or if not, hand coded in the simulator).

==Support in various programming languages==

===Ada===
Ada is a strongly typed language where all pointers are typed and only safe type conversions are permitted. All pointers are by default initialized to codice_74, and any attempt to access data through a codice_74 pointer causes an exception to be raised. Pointers in Ada are called &quot;access types&quot;. Ada 83 did not permit arithmetic on access types (although many compiler vendors provided for it as a non-standard feature), but Ada 95 supports “safe” arithmetic on access types via the package codice_76.

===BASIC===
Several old versions of BASIC for the Windows platform had support for STRPTR() to return the address of a string, and for VARPTR() to return the address of a variable. Visual Basic 5 also had support for OBJPTR() to return the address of an object interface, and for an ADDRESSOF operator to return the address of a function. The types of all of these are integers, but their values are equivalent to those held by pointer types.

Newer dialects of BASIC, such as FreeBASIC or BlitzMax, have exhaustive pointer implementations, however. In FreeBASIC, arithmetic on codice_77 pointers (equivalent to C&#x27;s codice_78) are treated as though the codice_77 pointer was a byte width. codice_77 pointers cannot be dereferenced, as in C. Also, casting between codice_77 and any other type&#x27;s pointers will not generate any warnings.
dim as integer f = 257
dim as any ptr g = @f
dim as integer ptr i = g
assert(*i = 257)
assert( (g + 4) = (@f + 1) )
===C and C++===
In C and C++ pointers are variables that store addresses and can be &quot;null&quot;. Each pointer has a type it points to, but one can freely cast between pointer types (but not between a function pointer and an object pointer). A special pointer type called the “void pointer” allows pointing to any (non-function) object, but is limited by the fact that it cannot be dereferenced directly (it shall be cast). The address itself can often be directly manipulated by casting a pointer to and from an integral type of sufficient size, though the results are implementation-defined and may indeed cause undefined behavior; while earlier C standards did not have an integral type that was guaranteed to be large enough, C99 specifies the codice_63 &quot;typedef name&quot; defined in codice_83, but an implementation need not provide it.

C++ fully supports C pointers and C typecasting. It also supports a new group of typecasting operators to help catch some unintended dangerous casts at compile-time. Since C++11, the C++ standard library also provides smart pointers (codice_84, codice_85 and codice_86) which can be used in some situations as a safer alternative to primitive C pointers. C++ also supports another form of reference, quite different from a pointer, called simply a &quot;reference&quot; or &quot;reference type&quot;.

Pointer arithmetic, that is, the ability to modify a pointer&#x27;s target address with arithmetic operations (as well as magnitude comparisons), is restricted by the language standard to remain within the bounds of a single array object (or just after it), and will otherwise invoke undefined behavior. Adding or subtracting from a pointer moves it by a multiple of the size of its datatype. For example, adding 1 to a pointer to 4-byte integer values will increment the pointer&#x27;s pointed-to byte-address by 4. This has the effect of incrementing the pointer to point at the next element in a contiguous array of integers—which is often the intended result. Pointer arithmetic cannot be performed on codice_87 pointers because the void type has no size, and thus the pointed address can not be added to, although gcc and other compilers will perform byte arithmetic on codice_78 as a non-standard extension, treating it as if it were codice_89.

Pointer arithmetic provides the programmer with a single way of dealing with different types: adding and subtracting the number of elements required instead of the actual offset in bytes. (Pointer arithmetic with codice_89 pointers uses byte offsets, because codice_59 is 1 by definition.) In particular, the C definition explicitly declares that the syntax codice_92, which is the codice_93-th element of the array codice_7, is equivalent to codice_95, which is the content of the element pointed by codice_96. This implies that codice_97 is equivalent to codice_92, and one can write, e.g., codice_99 or codice_100 equally well to access the fourth element of an array codice_7.

While powerful, pointer arithmetic can be a source of computer bugs. It tends to confuse novice programmers, forcing them into different contexts: an expression can be an ordinary arithmetic one or a pointer arithmetic one, and sometimes it is easy to mistake one for the other. In response to this, many modern high-level computer languages (for example Java) do not permit direct access to memory using addresses. Also, the safe C dialect Cyclone addresses many of the issues with pointers. See C programming language for more discussion.

The codice_87 pointer, or codice_78, is supported in ANSI C and C++ as a generic pointer type. A pointer to codice_87 can store the address of any object (not function), and, in C, is implicitly converted to any other object pointer type on assignment, but it must be explicitly cast if dereferenced.
K&amp;R C used codice_105 for the “type-agnostic pointer” purpose (before ANSI C).
int x = 4;
void* p1 = &amp;x;
int* p2 = p1; // void* implicitly converted to int*: valid C, but not C++
int a = *p2;
int b = *(int*)p1; // when dereferencing inline, there is no implicit conversion
C++ does not allow the implicit conversion of codice_78 to other pointer types, even in assignments. This was a design decision to avoid careless and even unintended casts, though most compilers only output warnings, not errors, when encountering other casts.
int x = 4;
void* p1 = &amp;x;
int* p2 = p1; // this fails in C++: there is no implicit conversion from void*
int* p3 = (int*)p1; // C-style cast
int* p4 = reinterpret_cast&lt;int*&gt;(p1); // C++ cast
In C++, there is no codice_107 (reference to void) to complement codice_78 (pointer to void), because references behave like aliases to the variables they point to, and there can never be a variable whose type is codice_87.

==== Pointer-to-member ====

In C++ pointers to non-static members of a class can be defined. If a class codice_110 has a member codice_111 then codice_112 is a pointer to the member codice_7 of type codice_114. This member can be an object or a function. They can be used on the right-hand side of operators codice_115 and codice_116 to access the corresponding member.
struct S {
int a;
int f() const {return a;}
S s1{};
S* ptrS = &amp;s1;

int S::* ptr = &amp;S::a; // pointer to S::a
int (S::* fp)()const = &amp;S::f; // pointer to S::f

s1.*ptr = 1;
std::cout « (s1.*fp)() « &quot;\n&quot;; // prints 1
ptrS-&gt;*ptr = 2;
std::cout « (ptrS-&gt;*fp)() « &quot;\n&quot;; // prints 2
====Pointer declaration syntax overview====
These pointer declarations cover most variants of pointer declarations. Of course it is possible to have triple pointers, but the main principles behind a triple pointer already exist in a double pointer. The naming used here is what the expression codice_117 equals for each of these types when using g++ or clang.
char A5_A5_c [5][5]; /* array of arrays of chars */
char *A5_Pc [5]; /* array of pointers to chars */
char **PPc; /* pointer to pointer to char (&quot;double pointer&quot;) */
char (*PA5_c) [5]; /* pointer to array(s) of chars */
char *FPcvE(); /* function which returns a pointer to char(s) */
char (*PFcvE)(); /* pointer to a function which returns a char */
char (*FPA5_cvE())[5]; /* function which returns pointer to an array of chars */
char (*A5_PFcvE[5])(); /* an array of pointers to functions which return a char */

The following declarations involving pointers-to-member are valid only in C++:

class C;
class D;
char C::* M1Cc; /* pointer-to-member to char */
char C::*A5_M1Cc [5]; /* array of pointers-to-member to char */
char* C::* M1CPc; /* pointer-to-member to pointer to char(s) */
char C::** PM1Cc; /* pointer to pointer-to-member to char */
char (*M1CA5_c) [5]; /* pointer-to-member to array(s) of chars */
char C::* FM1CcvE(); /* function which returns a pointer-to-member to char */
char D::* C::* M1CM1Dc; /* pointer-to-member to pointer-to-member to pointer to char(s) */
char C::* C::* M1CMS_c; /* pointer-to-member to pointer-to-member to pointer to char(s) */
char (C::* FM1CA5_cvE())[5]; /* function which returns pointer-to-member to an array of chars */
char (C::* M1CFcvE)() /* pointer-to-member-function which returns a char */
char (C::* A5_M1CFcvE[5])(); /* an array of pointers-to-member-functions which return a char */

The codice_118 and codice_119 have a higher priority than codice_120.
===C#===
In the C# programming language, pointers are supported by either marking blocks of code that include pointers with the codice_121 keyword, or by codice_122 the codice_123 assembly provisions for pointer access. 
The syntax is essentially the same as in C++, and the address pointed can be either managed or unmanaged memory. However, pointers to managed memory (any pointer to a managed object) must be declared using the codice_124 keyword, which prevents the garbage collector from moving the pointed object as part of memory management while the pointer is in scope, thus keeping the pointer address valid.

However, an exception to this is from using the codice_125 structure, which is a memory managed equivalent to codice_126, and does not require the codice_121 keyword nor the codice_128 assembly. This type is often returned when using methods from the codice_129, for example:
// Get 16 bytes of memory from the process&#x27;s unmanaged memory
IntPtr pointer = System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.AllocHGlobal(16);

// Do something with the allocated memory

// Free the allocated memory
System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.FreeHGlobal(pointer);
The .NET framework includes many classes and methods in the codice_130 and codice_129 namespaces (such as the codice_132 class) which convert .NET types (for example, codice_133) to and from many unmanaged types and pointers (for example, codice_134 or codice_78) to allow communication with unmanaged code. Most such methods have the same security permission requirements as unmanaged code, since they can affect arbitrary places in memory.

===COBOL===
The COBOL programming language supports pointers to variables. Primitive or group (record) data objects declared within the codice_136 of a program are inherently pointer-based, where the only memory allocated within the program is space for the address of the data item (typically a single memory word). In program source code, these data items are used just like any other codice_137 variable, but their contents are implicitly accessed indirectly through their codice_138 pointers.

Memory space for each pointed-to data object is typically allocated dynamically using external codice_139 statements or via embedded extended language constructs such as codice_140 or codice_141 statements.

Extended versions of COBOL also provide pointer variables declared with codice_142 codice_143 codice_144 clauses. The values of such pointer variables are established and modified using codice_145 and codice_145 codice_147 statements.

Some extended versions of COBOL also provide codice_148 variables, which are capable of storing the addresses of executable code.

===PL/I===
The PL/I language provides full support for pointers to all data types (including pointers to structures), recursion, multitasking, string handling, and extensive built-in functions. PL/I was quite a leap forward compared to the programming languages of its time. PL/I pointers are untyped, and therefore no casting is required for pointer dereferencing or assignment. The declaration syntax for a pointer is codice_149, which declares a pointer named &quot;xxx&quot;. Pointers are used with codice_150 variables. A based variable can be declared with a default locator (codice_151 or without (codice_152), where xxx is a based variable, which may be an element variable, a structure, or an array, and ppp is the default pointer). Such a variable can be address without an explicit pointer reference (codice_153, or may be addressed with an explicit reference to the default locator (ppp), or to any other pointer (codice_154).

Pointer arithmetic is not part of the PL/I standard, but many compilers allow expressions of the form codice_155. IBM PL/I also has the builtin function codice_156 to perform the arithmetic. Pointer arithmetic is always performed in bytes.

IBM &quot;Enterprise&quot; PL/I compilers have a new form of typed pointer called a codice_157.

===D===
The D programming language is a derivative of C and C++ which fully supports C pointers and C typecasting.

===Eiffel===
The Eiffel object-oriented language employs value and reference semantics without pointer arithmetic. Nevertheless, pointer classes are provided. They offer pointer arithmetic, typecasting, explicit memory management,
interfacing with non-Eiffel software, and other features.

===Fortran===
Fortran-90 introduced a strongly typed pointer capability. Fortran pointers contain more than just a simple memory address. They also encapsulate the lower and upper bounds of array dimensions, strides (for example, to support arbitrary array sections), and other metadata. An &quot;association operator&quot;, codice_158 is used to associate a codice_144 to a variable which has a codice_160 attribute. The Fortran-90 codice_161 statement may also be used to associate a pointer to a block of memory. For example, the following code might be used to define and create a linked list structure:

type real_list_t
 real :: sample_data(100)
 type (real_list_t), pointer :: next =&gt; null ()
end type

type (real_list_t), target :: my_real_list
type (real_list_t), pointer :: real_list_temp

real_list_temp =&gt; my_real_list
do
 read (1,iostat=ioerr) real_list_temp%sample_data
 if (ioerr /= 0) exit
 allocate (real_list_temp%next)
 real_list_temp =&gt; real_list_temp%next
end do
Fortran-2003 adds support for procedure pointers. Also, as part of the &quot;C Interoperability&quot; feature, Fortran-2003 supports intrinsic functions for converting C-style pointers into Fortran pointers and back.

===Go===
Go has pointers. Its declaration syntax is equivalent to that of C, but written the other way around, ending with the type. Unlike C, Go has garbage collection, and disallows pointer arithmetic. Reference types, like in C++, do not exist. Some built-in types, like maps and channels, are boxed (i.e. internally they are pointers to mutable structures), and are initialized using the codice_162 function. In an approach to unified syntax between pointers and non-pointers, the arrow (codice_163) operator has been dropped: the dot operator on a pointer refers to the field or method of the dereferenced object. This, however, only works with 1 level of indirection.

===Java===
There is no explicit representation of pointers in Java. Instead, more complex data structures like objects and arrays are implemented using references. The language does not provide any explicit pointer manipulation operators. It is still possible for code to attempt to dereference a null reference (null pointer), however, which results in a run-time exception being thrown. The space occupied by unreferenced memory objects is recovered automatically by garbage collection at run-time.

===Modula-2===
Pointers are implemented very much as in Pascal, as are codice_164 parameters in procedure calls. Modula-2 is even more strongly typed than Pascal, with fewer ways to escape the type system. Some of the variants of Modula-2 (such as Modula-3) include garbage collection.
===Oberon===
Much as with Modula-2, pointers are available. There are still fewer ways to evade the type system and so Oberon and its variants are still safer with respect to pointers than Modula-2 or its variants. As with Modula-3, garbage collection is a part of the language specification.
===Pascal===
Unlike many languages that feature pointers, standard ISO Pascal only allows pointers to reference dynamically created variables that are anonymous and does not allow them to reference standard static or local variables. It does not have pointer arithmetic. Pointers also must have an associated type and a pointer to one type is not compatible with a pointer to another type (e.g. a pointer to a char is not compatible with a pointer to an integer). This helps eliminate the type security issues inherent with other pointer implementations, particularly those used for PL/I or C. It also removes some risks caused by dangling pointers, but the ability to dynamically let go of referenced space by using the codice_165 standard procedure (which has the same effect as the codice_166 library function found in C) means that the risk of dangling pointers has not been entirely eliminated.

However, in some commercial and open source Pascal (or derivatives) compiler implementations —like Free Pascal, Turbo Pascal or the Object Pascal in Embarcadero Delphi— a pointer is allowed to reference standard static or local variables and can be cast from one pointer type to another. Moreover, pointer arithmetic is unrestricted: adding or subtracting from a pointer moves it by that number of bytes in either direction, but using the codice_167 or codice_168 standard procedures with it moves the pointer by the size of the data type it is &quot;declared&quot; to point to. An untyped pointer is also provided under the name codice_169, which is compatible with other pointer types.

===Perl===
The Perl programming language supports pointers, although rarely used, in the form of the pack and unpack functions. These are intended only for simple interactions with compiled OS libraries. In all other cases, Perl uses references, which are typed and do not allow any form of pointer arithmetic. They are used to construct complex data structures.

<text>The national flag of the Dominican Republic is one of the official national symbols of the nation, along with the coat of arms and the national anthem. The blue on the flag stands for liberty, the white for salvation, and the red for the blood of heroes. The civil flag follows the same design, but without the charge in the center. The flag was designed by Juan Pablo Duarte.

==Description==

As described by Article 21 of the Dominican Constitution, the flag features a centered white Saint George&#x27;s cross that extends to the edges and divides the flag into four rectangles; the top ones are blue (hoist side) and red, and the bottom ones are red (hoist side) and blue. The national coat of arms, featuring a shield with the flag, design and supported by a bay laurel branch (left) and a palm frond (right), is at the center of the cross. Above the shield, a blue ribbon displays the national motto &quot;Dios, Patria, Libertad&quot; (English: God, Homeland, Liberty). Below the shield, the words &quot;República Dominicana&quot; appear on a red ribbon (this red ribbon is depicted in more recent versions as having its tips pointing upward). In the center of the shield, flanked by three spears (two of them holding Dominican banners) on each side, is a Bible with a small Latin cross above it and said to be opened to the Gospel of John, chapter 8, verse 32, which reads &quot;Y la verdad os hará libres&quot; (And the truth shall make you free). It is one of 28 national flags to contain overtly Christian symbols.

<text>The national flag of Timor-Leste () consists of a red field with the black isosceles triangle based on the hoist-side bearing a white five-pointed star in the center superimposed on the larger yellow triangle, also based on the hoist-side, that extends to the center of the flag.

== Official description of the flag ==

According to the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste&quot;, Part I, Section 15:&quot;
:&quot;The national flag is rectangular and is formed by two isosceles triangles, the bases of which are overlapping. One triangle is black and its height is equal to two-third of the length overlapped to the yellow triangle, whose height is equal to half the length of the Flag. In the centre of the black triangle there is a white star of five ends, meaning the light that guides. The white star has one of its ends turned towards the left side end of the flag. The remaining part of the flag is red.&quot;
With the constitution of the &quot;Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste&quot; on November 28, 1975, the flag was officially adopted for the first time. The symbolism of this flag was given the following meaning:

* Black represents the four centuries of colonial oppression.
* The yellow arrowhead represents &quot;the traces of colonialism in Timor-Leste&#x27;s history&quot; and the struggle for independence.
* Red stands for the spilled blood of the population.
* The white star symbolises hope for a better future.

Today, both the colours and their meanings are specified in the new Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste of 2002 (Part I, Section 15):

* Black symbolises obscurantism, which must be overcome.
* Yellow represents the wealth of the country.
* Red symbolises the struggle for national liberation.
* The white star, or &quot;the light that guides&quot;, is white to represent peace.

Flags are powerful symbols in East Timorese culture and have a high cultural significance. They play a significant role in East Timorese identification as a community. Flags are automatically attributed a symbolic power, making them a sacred object.

=== Variations ===

The tones of the individual colours are not precisely defined in the Constitution. The Independence Day Celebrations Committee of the United Nations Transitional Administration for East Timor (UNTAET) indicated light orange (PMS 123) as the correct shade of yellow, which is usually found on official flags. In flag illustrations in books or on the internet, but also in flags commonly used in Timor-Leste, a light yellow is also widely used. According to the UNTAET source, the red corresponds to the tone PMS 485. Here, too, there are versions with a light red in Timor-Leste. Even darker versions only appear as flag images, but not as flags. Although UNTAET gives the size of the black triangle as a quarter of the flag&#x27;s length, the existing flags and illustrations all have a triangle with a size of one third.

There is disagreement about the correct proportions of the flag. While the 1975 flag always had the 2:3 ratio common in most of Europe, flags with a ratio of 1:2 also appeared in official use with the independence of Timor-Leste. The reason for this is presumably that these flags are manufactured in Australia, where the proportions of 1:2 are customary. A clear uniform regulation was initially pending, but Law 02/2007 on the national symbols shows a picture of a flag with a 1:2 ratio in the appendix. Furthermore, the law lists in Article 4 the different formats of the flag in which the cloth flag should hang in public offices, barracks, private and state schools. Type 1 consists of a cloth 45 centimetres wide, Type 2 consists of a cloth 90 centimetres wide, Type 3 135 centimetres wide and so on up to Type 7 315 centimetres wide. However, in paragraph 2, the article explicitly allows smaller and larger flags, as well as those with sizes in between, as long as the proportions are respected.

Flags are often seen with the top of the star pointing straight up. This was often the case with the 1975 flag. But today&#x27;s constitution clearly states that the star should point with a tip to the upper left corner. This is also followed by the illustration in Law 02/2007.

The flag of Timor-Leste used for the independence celebration on 20 May 2002 had a straight star despite the clear specifications. It also had an aspect ratio of 1:2 and used the bright yellow in combination with the bright red.

==History==
=== Monarchical Era (1702–1910) ===
Until independence from Portugal, the colony of Portuguese Timor used only the flag of Portugal. The Liurais, the traditional rulers of Timor, drew part of their claim to rule from sacred objects (lulik) owned by the ruling families. When the invaders subjugated the Liurais as vassals, they gave them Portuguese flags, which, along with the flagpoles, became sacred objects themselves, thus legitimising the rule of the Portuguese and the Liurais loyal to them. Especially in the culture of the Mambai, the flag cult took on a central significance. According to their myth of origin, the world order is created by two brothers. The elder brother, from whom the Timorese descend, holds the ritual power over the cosmos. The younger brother has the power over the social order. The non-Timorese peoples, in this case the Portuguese, are descended from this brother. The myth tells of the loss, search and recovery of a lost, sacred object, namely the Portuguese flag. This sacred meaning of the blue and white flag led to some problems when the flag of Portugal was changed in 1910 when the country changed from a monarchy to a republic.

=== Republican Era (1911–1975) ===

On 15 February 1946, the Angola arrived at the Portuguese naval base of Alcântara from Portuguese Timor. She brought home Portuguese who had lived in the colony during the Battle of Timor in the Second World War. A white flag with the Portuguese Timorese coat of arms on a green and red cross appears in the crowd.

In 1961, a small, left-oriented Timorese resistance movement - the &quot;Bureau de Luta pela Libertação de Timor&quot; (BLLT) - used a flag that already had some elements of today&#x27;s national flag. It consisted of a yellow-bordered black disc with a five-pointed white star on red cloth. Later, the BLLT established a short-lived government-in-exile in Jakarta called the &quot;United Republic of Timor&quot;, which used the same flag.

In 1967, there were proposals for separate flags for the individual Portuguese colonies, with the coat of arms of the colony added to the lower right of the flag of Portugal. However, the proposals were never implemented.

==== Portugal&#x27;s last flag over East Timor ====

After the Carnation Revolution in 1974, Portugal prepared its colonies for independence. However, civil war broke out in Portuguese Timor in August 1975 between the left-leaning Fretilin and the conservative Timorese Democratic Union (UDT). Portugal&#x27;s governor Mário Lemos Pires was forced to evacuate all Portuguese administrative and military personnel and their families to the island of Atauro off the coast of the capital Dili on August 26 and 27. In the end, the Fretilin prevailed in the battle. Pires was urged by them to return to Dili and press ahead with decolonization, but he insisted on waiting for instructions from Lisbon. It was not until October that the Portuguese corvette &quot;Afonso Cerqueira&quot; reached Atauro, bringing Pires his first sign of support from Portugal. Indonesia took advantage of the situation to infiltrate and occupy the areas near the Portuguese-Timorese border with troops. On December 7, Indonesia began the open invasion and occupation of Dili and the rest of the territory. After the evacuation of the Portuguese personnel to Atauro, the Portuguese flag continued to fly over the Governor&#x27;s Palace in Dili. Only on the day of the declaration of independence by the Fretilin was the flag taken down by the Falintil commander Jaime Camacho Amaral and replaced by the new flag of East Timor. The whereabouts of this Portuguese flag are not known.

However, the Portuguese flag continued to fly on Atauro, where Pires had retreated to. It was not until December 30, 1975 that Indonesian troops occupied Atauro. In an official military ceremony attended by Indonesian and local Portuguese soldiers under the command of Ensign (&quot;alferes&quot;) David Ximenes, the flag of Portugal was taken down and replaced by the flag of Indonesia. At their request, the Portuguese flag was handed over to Guilherme de Sousa, a primary school teacher and UDT deputy from Atauro, and Luís Amaral, the head of administration (&quot;chefe de posto&quot;) of Atauro. The following day, Pires and the Portuguese community left the colony from Atauro on board two Portuguese warships. The UDT was cooperating with the Indonesian occupation at the time. UDT members brought the flag, escorted by Indonesian soldiers, to Dili and handed it over to UDT President Francisco Lopes da Cruz. From 1976 to 1982, Lopes da Cruz was the Indonesian deputy governor of occupied East Timor. Lopes da Cruz then moved to Jakarta and became special advisor on East Timor to Indonesia&#x27;s dictator Suharto. Lopes da Cruz took the flag with him. Although there were repeated calls for the flag to be handed over to a museum or the Indonesian National Archives, Lopes da Cruz refused to hand it over. Finally, Suharto decided that Lopes da Cruz could keep the flag and gave him a special suitcase with the insignia of the President of the Republic of Indonesia to keep the flag in as a sign of his loyalty. Lopes da Cruz later served as Indonesia&#x27;s ambassador to Greece and Portugal. In contrast to the last flags of the other six colonies that Portugal lost or relinquished into independence from 1961, the whereabouts of the Timorese flag of Portugal remained unknown to the public for a long time. It was only in 2015 that Lopes da Cruz presented it to journalists. He regards the flag as a &quot;relic&quot; and keeps it in a small room of its own, together with Suharto&#x27;s suitcase and a crucifix about one meter high, which Lopes da Cruz bought in Fátima in 1994.

=== Independence (1974–1975) ===
After the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, parties were also allowed in Portuguese Timor. East Timor&#x27;s dominant leftist party, the Frente Revolucionária de Timor-Leste Independente (Fretilin) used the same colours as the BLLT in its party flag and also the white star on a black background. Apart from their political orientation, there are no links between the two organisations. To what extent the flag served as a model or simply common socialist symbols, such as the five-pointed star and the colour red, were used on the party flag is not clear. According to legend, the resistance fighter Natalino Leitão designed the current national flag based on the Fretilin flag the night before the proclamation of independence from Portugal on 28 November 1975. The incipient occupation of the country by Indonesia had put the Fretilin on the spot. Today, 28 November is Timor-Leste&#x27;s bank holidays, when official buildings are flagged. Only nine days after the declaration of independence, Indonesia openly started to invade East Timor. Natalino Leitão was killed in the process.

The declaration of independence was only recognised by a few countries. Politically, Indonesia was supported by the United States and Australia, as they feared a second Cuba due to the leftist orientation of Fretilin. The extent to which the red basic colour and the certain similarity of the flag design to Cuba&#x27;s flag supported this assumption is debatable. That the flag of Cuba or the flag of Mozambique were models for Leitão&#x27;s triangular design can only be assumed. At least there were and still are sympathies for Cuba and especially for Ernesto Che Guevara in Timor-Leste. Fretilin already had close relations with Mozambique and its ruling party FRELIMO.

=== Indonesian occupation (1975–1999) ===
Beyond party political affiliation, the flag of the Fretilin became more and more a symbol of the organisation of resistance for the people during the occupation, and the national flag of 1975 a symbol of the people and their urge for independence. The occupation forces reacted to the use of the flags with severe repression. The use of flags other than the flag of Indonesia was forbidden. Until 1999, East Timor was governed by Indonesia as a province, while internationally it was considered a &quot;dependent territory under Portuguese administration&quot;. As an Indonesian province, it was also given a provincial flag, but this was only used in the governor&#x27;s office, as was customary with all provincial flags. The flag of Timor Timur, as Timor-Leste was officially called at the time, displayed the provincial coat of arms on an orange background. When a Portuguese parliamentary delegation was due to visit East Timor in 1989, the Indonesian government distributed 30,000 Indonesian flags to be placed on the homes of Dili. This was intended to demonstrate the integration of East Timor into Indonesia.
The armed resistance against the Indonesians was led by Falintil, which was originally the military arm of Fretilin. In 1987, its leader Xanana Gusmão transformed Falintil into a national army of East Timorese resistance. He designed a new blue-white-green-black flag of the Falintil. The Conselho Nacional de Resistência Timorense (CNRT), the umbrella organisation of East Timorese resistance founded in 1998, adopted the Falintil flag as a politically neutral symbol. They replaced the lettering &quot;FALINTIL&quot; with &quot;CNRT&quot; and changed the symbols in the shield. The Falintil used a yellow five-pointed star, two traditional swords (suriks) and three feathers. The CNRT used a spear and two arrows instead of the feathers, and the star was now white. The Falintil adopted this version of the coat of arms for its flag relatively soon. The shield in the flag of the CNRT is also found in slightly modified form with the same elements in the later first coat of arms of Timor-Leste (2002-2006) after the restoration of independence. In the Falintil camps, it was strictly forbidden to walk through the shadow of the flag. Allegedly, this rule dates back to colonial times, when Timorese were beaten up if they walked through the shadow of the flag of Portugal.

In the 1999 independence referendum in East Timor, the population could choose between full independence and remaining part of Indonesia as the &quot;Special Autonomous Region of East Timor&quot; (SARET). Article 20 of SARET&#x27;s draft constitution provided for the possibility of adopting its own coat of arms, but not its own flag. Instead, the flag of Indonesia was to continue to be used.

=== Contemporary Era (1990–Present) ===

When the United Nations took control in East Timor after the referendum, they used the United Nations flag. At the Sydney Olympics in 2000, four East Timorese athletes participated as Independent Olympic Athletes under the flag of the Olympic Games, as Timor-Leste was not yet independent and there was no National Olympic Committee.

The flag of Timor-Leste was adopted in 2002. It is the same as the flag that was originally adopted when the country declared its independence from Portugal in 1975, nine days before being invaded by Indonesia. At midnight on 19 May 2002, and during the first moments of Independence Day the next day, the United Nations flag was lowered and the flag of an independent Timor-Leste was raised. The flag was officially reinstated on 20 May 2002, when the United Nations flag was taken down at midnight and the East Timorese flag was hoisted. According to the various local accounts, people were in tears for days and produced a special hand woven textile (Tais) in which to wrap the downed UN flag, as if it was a death shroud, but also to protect it and to preserve its mystical ‘sacred’ power (luli). This flag became a symbol of liberation and protection for the Timorese.

After independence, every village in the country received a copy of the new national flag, which was handed over to them in a solemn ceremony. Consciously or unconsciously, this follows the Portuguese tradition of handing over the Portuguese flag to the vassals.

During the celebrations of the seventh anniversary of independence on 20 May 2009, the national flag fell to the ground. Many Timorese saw this as a bad omen. At the flag-raising ceremony in 2002, the flag did not flutter in the wind and violent riots broke out a few months later. The opposition party Fretilin saw the renewed incident as a sign that the government was in trouble, and one of the country&#x27;s biggest newspapers, the &quot;Timor Post&quot;, reported the event on its front page.

Since 1 August 2011, the national flag has been placed in front of public institutions on the first Monday of every month. Likewise on 2 February (Timor Leste Defence Forces Day FDTL), 27 March (Timor-Leste National Police Day PNTL) and 20 August (FALINTIL Day). The flag is always raised at 8 am, with employees and officials of the institution all present and singing the national anthem.

In 2016, MPs Manuel Castro, Manuel Guterres, and Natalino dos Santos Nascimento criticised the fact that more people were writing on the flag, for example with signatures. In the view of the politicians, this is a &quot;crime&quot; against which the police should take action. The flag, which had been bought &quot;with bones and blood&quot;, was thereby desecrated.

== Alternative flag debate ==
A different flag had been suggested by the representatives of the Timorese political parties and organisations during the first East Timorese National Convention held in April 1998 in Portugal. This flag was originally the flag of CNRT (&quot;Conselho Nacional de Resistência Timorense&quot;, National Council of Timorese Resistance). Because of CNRT&#x27;s popularity, there was a consensus of the participants of the convention to adopt their flag as a temporary flag for Timor-Leste. It was replaced by the former design of 1975 in 2002.

A discussion began about which flag a future, independent Timor-Leste should use. There were voices calling for the national flag to be changed, as the 1975 flag was a symbol of Fretilin. Already at the first East Timorese National Convention in Peniche (Portugal) from 23 to 27 April 1998, the delegates of the Timorese parties decided in favour of the flag of the CNRT as the provisional flag of Timor-Leste. In the 1999 referendum on independence, the UN had accordingly depicted on the ballot papers the Indonesian flag for remaining with Indonesia and the flag of the CNRT for independence as a decision-making aid. The veterans&#x27; organisation CPD-RDTL accused Fretilin of monopolising the current national flag. The group Colimau 2000 demanded that a Christian cross be included in the national flag to symbolise the importance of Catholicism in Timor-Leste. However, most parties and the majority of the population do not support a change. They saw the national flag as a symbol of suffering in the struggle for independence, regardless of its authorship.

At demonstrations in and outside Timor-Leste, almost only the old 1975 flag and the Fretilin flag were displayed. The very similarity of the two flags was recognised in respect for the merits of Fretilin in the struggle for independence. So in the end, the flag of 1975 was used. Another reason was probably the overwhelming majority of Fretilin in the new parliament. The Socialist Party of Timor (PST) had also demanded the red-yellow-black flag. The flag of the CNRT, as a symbol of the unity of the East Timorese, did not have the same popular support in the end. The Timor Leste Defence Force (F-FDTL), which absorbed the FALINTIL, now use the FALINTIL flag and coat of arms in the &quot;spear-and-arrows version&quot;.

== Other flags ==

Over the last few years, more and more flags of authorities, schools and other institutions have appeared. Usually they are single-coloured flags with the logo or coat of arms of the organisations. The country&#x27;s football clubs also adorn themselves with logos and flags.

The flags of Timor-Leste&#x27;s political parties are diverse. They serve as advertising media at political events and were also depicted for illiterate people as an identifying sign on the ballot papers for the parliamentary elections on 30 June 2007. The importance of party flags for supporters was made clear by three incidents that took place during the unrest following the 2007 general election. At that time, Fretilin supporters had hung their flags in their eastern strongholds as a sign of protest against the new government. Australian troops then allegedly denigrated and stole three Fretilin flags as souvenirs. The Australian commander, Brigadier John Hutcheson, personally returned one of the flags and expressed regret over the incident. The other two flags were returned through other authorities. Fretilin Secretary General Alkatiri nevertheless called for the withdrawal of the Australians, saying they were no longer neutral.

In Catholic processions and celebrations, one sees blue-white and yellow-white flags, the latter sometimes with red crosses. Blue and white (as also found on the former flag of Portugal) are the traditional colours of Our Lady of the Conception (Nossa Senhora da Conceição). Mary is considered the patron saint of the country. Yellow and white are the colours of the Catholic Church (see also: Flag of Vatican City).

The veterans&#x27; organisation CPD-RDTL originally displayed the national flag of Timor-Leste at its demonstrations. However, at the end of 2012, flags were used whose design was reminiscent of the flag of the &quot;Bureau de Luta pela Libertação de Timor&quot; in 1961.

==Subnational flags==
Some of the Municipalities of Timor-Leste have adopted their own flags. Originally, Timor-Leste&#x27;s municipalities did not have their own flags. However, during the colonial period between 1962 and 1975, Dili was the only place in Portuguese Timor to have a municipal flag that corresponded in design to the Portuguese municipal flags. It was green and white with eight stripes and showed the town&#x27;s coat of arms in the centre: Red, a sandalwood tree in silver between two bundles of arrows with halberds and hunting spears. Above the escutcheon, a brick crown with five towers representing Dili&#x27;s status as the capital of an overseas province. In addition, a banner with the words &quot;O Sol logo em nascendo vê primeiro&quot; (Where the sun was first born). As a sign of solidarity, Dili&#x27;s flag was hung in Lisbon&#x27;s city hall in 1991.

Since 2015, the municipalities have adopted logos and coats of arms as symbols, which are then also presented on flags with a single-colour background. For example, the Oe-Cusse Ambeno Special Administrative Region has a green flag with a logo and the municipality of Manufahi has an orange flag with its coat of arms. Baucau displays its coat of arms on a white background.

<text>The national flag of Ecuador, which consists of horizontal bands of yellow (double width), blue and red, was first adopted by law in 1835 and later on 26 September 1860. The design of the current flag was finalized in 1900 with the addition of the coat of arms in the center of the flag. Before using the yellow, blue and red tricolor, Ecuador&#x27;s former flag had three light blue stripes and two white stripes with three white stars for each province of the country. The design of the flag is very similar to those of Colombia and Venezuela, which are also former constituent territories of Gran Colombia. All three are based on a proposal by Venezuelan General Francisco de Miranda, which was adopted by Venezuela in 1811 and later Gran Colombia with some modifications. There is a variant of the flag that does not contain the coat of arms that is used by the merchant marine. This flag matches Colombia&#x27;s in every aspect, but Colombia uses a different design when her merchant marine ships are at sail.

==Design==

The Ecuadorian National Secretariat of Communication (&quot;Secretaría Nacional de Comunicación&quot;) issued regulations describing the applications and proportions of the national flag, coat of arms, and other national symbols in November 2009.

The national flag has a length of 2.20 meters and a width of 1.47 m, a ratio of 2 to 3. The field is split into three horizontal colored bands, a yellow band of one-half the flag&#x27;s width, a blue band of one-quarter the width, and a red band of one-quarter the width. All three bands extend the full length of the flag. The flag is charged with the Ecuadorian coat of arms scaled to one-half the width of the flag and centered in the field. The coat of arms itself is constructed in a rectangle with proportions 12:10. The national standard has the same design as the national flag, but is square, with length 0.9 m and width 0.9 m. When used by military units and organizations, lettering can encircle the coat of arms with a diameter of 55 centimeters. The lettering must be 4 cm in height, 3 cm in width, gold-colored Roman font, embroidered with gold thread. The only other regulated size is a table flag (banderola) where the flag is 200 mm wide and 300 mm long. When manufacturing the national flag, sellers to the public must include the name of their company, along with the year of manufacture, by placing a 20 × 10 mm tag on the reverse side of the flag on the sleeve.

===Coat of arms===
In the background of the oval shield is the mountain Chimborazo, while the river originating from its base represents the Guayas. Chimborazo is also the highest mountain in Ecuador and is part of the Andes Range. The steamboat on the river is named &quot;Guayas&quot; as well. The ship was built in Guayaquil and was the first seaworthy steamship built in both Ecuador and in all of South America. It was first put into service on 9 October 1841. The ship has the features of a Caduceus representing trade and economy. This kind of mast has two wings surrounding a pole with two snakes encircling it. On top a golden sun surrounded by the Zodiac astrological signs for Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer representing the months March to July to symbolize the duration of the March Revolution of 1845 that ousted General Juan José Flores.

The condor on top of the shield stretches his wings to symbolize power, greatness and strength of Ecuador. The condor also represents the idea that it will always be ready to attack any enemy. The shield is flanked by four national flags. The laurel on the left represents the victories of the republic. The palm leaf on the right side is a symbol of the martyrs of the fight for independence and liberty. The Fasces below the shield represents the republican dignity. The final design of the coat of arms was completed in 1900.

In the 1989 specifications issued to the Ecuadorian Military, the coat of arms has only eight colors that are used on the flag. The eight colors are yellow, blue, red (all from the national flag), sky blue, green, grey, silver and gold. There is also a nine piece instruction on how to draw the coat of arms, followed by a full color drawing and a black and white drawing of the arms. No size specifications have been laid out for the coat of arms except for when it is used on the national flag.

===Symbolism===
Miranda ascribed the colours he chose for his flag to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s theory of primary colours. In a letter written to Count Semyon Romanovich Vorontsov in 1792, Miranda described a late-night conversation which he had with Goethe at a party in Weimar, Germany during the winter of 1785. Fascinated with Miranda&#x27;s account of his exploits in the American Revolutionary War and his travels throughout the Americas and Europe, Goethe told him that, &quot;Your destiny is to create in your land a place where primary colours are not distorted.” He proceeded to clarify what he meant:
The flag features a unique coat of arms at its center, depicting a mountain, a river, and the famous Galápagos Islands, emphasizing Ecuador&#x27;s diverse geography. This flag is a symbol of national pride, reflecting Ecuador&#x27;s independence and unity. The bold colors of yellow, blue, and red, symbolize the country&#x27;s rich cultural and natural heritage.
The first time the yellow, blue and red flag was flown by Miranda was in 1806 on the ship &quot;Leander&quot; when trying to face the Spanish forces off of the coast of Jacmel, Haiti. The colors of the modern Ecuadorian flag evolved from those of the flag of the nation of Gran Colombia, which encompassed the territories of modern-day Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. The colors have the following meanings:

*Yellow: The crops and the fertile soil.
*Blue: The ocean and the clear skies
*Red: The blood spilled by the heroes who died in the name of their countrymen&#x27;s Fatherland and Freedom.

==History==

After the territory of Ecuador was conquered by Sebastián de Benalcázar, the emblems of the Spanish Empire flew over the newly founded city of Quito.

The first calls for independence from the Spanish crown came on 10 August 1809; a plain red flag was flown by the rebels. The independence movement was defeated in November 1812 at the hands of Spanish officer Juan Sámano. On 9 October 1820, a new flag, a blue and white bicolour, with five horizontal alternating stripes, and three white stars in the middle stripe, was raised for the first time. The three stars represent Guayaquil, Portoviejo and Machala. This flag was later adopted by the Guayas Province.

Gabriel García Moreno, upon assuming power two days after the Battle of Guayaquil in September 1860, the yellow, blue and red triband was returned to use; its reinstatement on 26 September is commemorated as &quot;Día de la Bandera&quot;, or National Flag Day in English. Previously, a vertical white, blue and white flag was used. In the middle of the blue stripe, there were white stars placed to signify the number of provinces in Ecuador. The highest star total was seven before this flag was abandoned. In 1900, the flag was made the definitive national standard, and was charged with the coat of arms for official national government use while the plain flag was reserved for the merchant marine.
==Pledge and hymn==
Students and military cadets in Ecuador are required to recite a pledge to the flag, known as the &quot;Juramento a la Bandera&quot; or &quot;Pledge to the Flag.&quot; This pledge is usually stated during national holiday or important school functions, such as graduations. There is also a patriotic song called the &quot;Himno a la Bandera&quot; (&quot;Hymn to the Flag&quot;) that is after the &quot;Juramento a la Bandera&quot; or before flag retirement ceremonies.

==Variants==

According to &quot; No. 1272&quot;, a decree signed into law on 5 December 1900, there are two official designs of the national flag. Article Two established the national banner as the tricolor with the yellow stripe doubling the size of the blue and red stripes. Article Three establishes the national flag charged with the coat of arms and is directed to be used by the military, government offices and diplomatic agents outside of Ecuador. While this law establishes the flag with the coat of arms as the state flag, it did not forbid the civilian population from using the flag. The only restriction is stated in Article Six where the merchant marine is restricted to using the flag without the coat of arms. Because of this, this has been construed to be the civil flag as it was practiced in other South American countries, such as Peru, Bolivia and Argentina. Unlike Ecuador, several of these South American countries forbade the civilian population from using the national flag with the coat of arms or, in the case of Argentina until 1985, the national flag charged with the Sun of May in the middle. Peru and Bolivia still restricts the usage of the state flag to just the government bodies and institutions and reserves the plain flags for national celebrations or as directed by law. However, in practice the flag with the coat of arms is often used in place of the plain flag, especially when it is important to distinguish the latter from the flag of Colombia. In the case when Colombian merchant marine ships are at sea, the Colombian national flag is charged with a red and blue oval with a white star in the center. For city governments, Article 4 in the 1900 decree forbids them from using the national flag with the coat of arms. A special flag was created for the city governments to use; it is a plain national flag charged with white stars that are placed in a circle pattern. The number of white stars will correspond to the number of provinces in Ecuador. However, this flag is identical to Venezuela&#x27;s flag from 1905 until 1930, and similar to Venezuela&#x27;s current flag (the stars are now in a semi circle pattern).

==Derivatives==
Palestina Canton uses the national flag on their flag. Placed in the canton, the Ecuador flag is shown with three even stripes, while the rest of the flag is colored olive green. The use of the Ecuador flag was described by the Palestina government as &quot;unity with the motherland&quot; and olive green represents progress. Loja Province adopted a flag in 1963 that copied the design of the national flag. This was done by the creator of the flag to show his &quot;honor and admiration&quot; to the homeland. Another province, Napo, chose their flag that copied the design of the national flag without the coat of arms. The only modification that was performed was to put a white strip between the blue and yellow.

==Resemblance to other flags==

The current flags of Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, can all trace their roots to the flag of the nation of Gran Colombia (1819–1830), the short-lived republic that encompassed the territories of all three. The Gran Colombian flag in turn was inspired by the flag of the First Republic of Venezuela, the first independent government of that nation. The flag of the Venezuelan Republic was modeled on the one created earlier by General Francisco de Miranda during his attempts to gain Venezuelan independence and which first flew over the port of La Vela in Santa Ana de Coro, Venezuela, in 1806.

As of 2006, the Ecuadoran flag still shares some similarity with the flags of Colombia and Venezuela. All three flags use the yellow, blue and red tricolor, but that is where the similarities end. In a decree passed in Colombia in 1934, the ratio of the stripes were set at 2:1:1 and the flag ratio was set at 2:3, similar to the present Ecuador flag. However, the coat of arms is only changed in the middle of the flag when it is used by government officials or by military forces. For Venezuela, the basic design was to have all three strips even vertically, unlike those of Colombia and Ecuador. Since 1863, Venezuela decided to change their flag with white stars instead of a coat of arms. A coat of arms was added to the national flag in 1954, then changed again in 2006 to add another star and alter the coat of arms. The position of the coat of arms on the Venezuelan flag also differs from Ecuador and Colombia by placing the arms at the very top hoist (left) side of the flag instead of in the center.

<text>The national flag of Egypt ( ) is a tricolour consisting of the three equal horizontal red, white, and black bands of the Arab Liberation Flag that dates back to the 1952 Egyptian Revolution. The flag bears Egypt&#x27;s national emblem, the Egyptian eagle of Saladin, centred in the white band.

==Symbolism==
In 1952, the Egyptian Free Officers who toppled King Farouk in the 23 July Revolution assigned specific symbolism to each of the three bands of the revolutionary and liberation flag. The red band symbolizes the Egyptians’ bloods in the war against colonization. The white band symbolizes the purity of the Egyptians’ hearts. The black band below the white symbolizes the manner in which darkness is overcome.

Egypt&#x27;s Revolutionary and Liberation flag, which was designed on 23 July 1952, was then an inspiration to several Arab countries and was adopted by many Arab states. The same horizontal tricolour is used by Iraq, Sudan and Yemen (and formerly Libya and Syria), the only difference being the presence (or absence) of distinguishing national emblems in the white band.

== Colours scheme ==

==History==
The development of the modern Egyptian flag was determined first by the Muhammad Ali Dynasty, under whom Egypt was united with Sudan, and later by the rise of Egyptian nationalism and revolutionary ideas among the Egyptian Army.

===Muhammad Ali Dynasty (1805–1922)===
When Muhammad Ali successfully seized power in Egypt, at that time the country was officially an Eyalet (Egypt Eyalet) of the Ottoman Empire. However, throughout his reign, and that of his sons and grandsons, Egypt enjoyed virtual independence as an own Khedivate. The meaning of the three stars and crescents has been suggested that this was to symbolise the victory of his armies in three continents (Africa, Asia, and Europe), and his own sovereignty over Egypt, Sudan, and Hejaz. The similarity with the flag of the Ottoman Empire was deliberate, as Muhammad Ali harbored grandiose ambitions of deposing the Ottoman dynasty, and seizing the sultanic throne himself.

Egypt retained this flag even after formal Ottoman sovereignty was terminated in 1914, when Egypt was declared to be a sultanate, and a British protectorate.

After the Urabi Revolt in 1882, British forces occupied the country, igniting ever greater nationalist resentment. This reached a peak in the Revolution of 1919, when both the red flag introduced by Muhammad Ali, and a special green banner bearing a crescent and cross were used in protests against the British (the latter symbolizing that both Egypt&#x27;s Muslim and Christian communities supported the Egyptian nationalist movement against the occupation).

===Kingdom of Egypt (1922–1953)===

In 1922, the UK agreed to formally recognize Egyptian independence, but only on the condition that the Sultan of Egypt, Fuad I, change his title to King. Upon so doing, the now King Fuad issued a Royal Decree formally adopting a new national flag of a white crescent with three white stars on a green background in it.

The three stars symbolised the three component territories of the Kingdom, namely Egypt, Nubia, and Sudan, while the green signifies the agricultural nature of the country, other sources suggest that it symbolised the predominant religion of the country, Islam. It has also been suggested that the three stars represented the three religious communities of the country: Muslims, Christians and Jews.

===Republic of Egypt (1953–1958) – Egyptian Free Officers movement===

Following the Revolution of 1952, the Egyptian free officers retained the flag of the Kingdom, but also introduced the Revolutionary and Liberation flag of red, white, and black horizontal bands, with the emblem of the Revolution, the Eagle of Saladin, in the center band. This earlier version of the eagle differs somewhat from the one later adopted. Even when the Kingdom was formally abolished by the declaration of the Republic on July 18, 1953, the flag of the Kingdom remained in official use, until Gamal Abdel Nasser announced the formation of a new regional political union and changed the name to United Arab Republic in 1958. The new flag symbolised a break from the Ottoman-inspired flags of the monarchical period, placing emphasis on the Arab nationalism then espoused by the Nasser government.


===United Arab Republic – Egyptian-Syrian Union under President Gamal Abdel Nasser (1958–1972)===

In 1958, Syria united with Egypt to form the United Arab Republic (UAR) and adopted a national flag based on the original Egyptian Liberation flag after the revolution, but with two green stars (representing the two countries of the union) replacing the former Egyptian Eagle in the white band. A modified version of that eagle was then adopted as the UAR&#x27;s coat of arms. The flag with the 2 green stars, representing the two constituent nations was used as the national flag of Syria until the ousting of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. It was briefly used by the Yemen Arab Republic for two months in 1962.


===Federation of Arab Republics (1972–1984) – A regional union attempt by Muammar Gaddafi ===

Though Syria withdrew from the UAR in 1961, Egypt continued to use the official name of the United Arab Republic until 1971, when the country was renamed officially as the Arab Republic of Egypt. In 1972, when Egypt formed the Federation of Arab Republics along with Syria, and Libya, the UAR&#x27;s flag (whose design Syria would reuse for their own flag, eight years later) was replaced by a common flag for the Federation, once again based on the Arab Liberation Flag. The two green stars in the white band were replaced by the Hawk of Qureish, which had been the coat of arms of Syria prior to the formation of the UAR in 1958. The Hawk of Qureish was also adopted as the Federation&#x27;s coat of arms.


===Arab Republic of Egypt (1984–present)===

While the Federation of Arab Republics was dissolved in 1977, Egypt retained the Federation&#x27;s flag until October 4, 1984, when the gold Hawk of Qureish was replaced in the white band (and on the coat of arms) by the Eagle of Saladin (the 1958 version as opposed to the 1952 version). The shield held by the eagle is colored entirely gold and white, as opposed to the colors seen on the shield on Egypt&#x27;s coat of arms.

====Rules governing the hoisting of the flag====
The flag is hoisted on all Egyptian governmental buildings on Fridays, national holidays, the opening session of the House of Representatives, and any other occasions as determined by the Minister of the Interior. The flag is hoisted daily on border posts, customs buildings, Egyptian consulates, and embassies overseas on Revolution Day (July 23), and other national holidays, as well as during the visit of the Egyptian President to the country hosting the diplomatic mission.

Abusing the flag in any way is a criminal offense and is punishable under law as it implies the contempt of the power of the state. Penal provisions also govern abuse of foreign flags or national emblems of other countries.

<text>The flag of El Salvador features a horizontal triband of cobalt blue-white-cobalt blue, with the coat of arms centered and entirely contained within the central white stripe. This design of a triband of blue-white-blue is commonly used among Central American countries. The country&#x27;s flag is one of the few that currently use the color purple, due to the rainbow in its coat of arms.

== Features ==

The colors signify:
* 
*The flag has the words (REPÚBLICA DE EL SALVADOR EN LA AMÉRICA CENTRAL) in a bold and Heavy, Sans Serif Boris Black Bloxx typeface, in a golden amber color
*The national motto (DIOS UNIÓN LIBERTAD) in Trajan bold Roman square capitals. The letter are colored amber gold on the civil flag, and black in the coat of arms
*The date (15 DE SEPTIEMBRE DE 1821) in Trajan bold Roman square capitals

The blue hue is a vivid, lustrous and luscious rich solid cobalt blue. In the center of and occupying the entire width of the white stripe is the coat of arms with its top touching the upper blue strip and its base touching the lower blue stripe. The coat of arms contains the in bold golden amber words &quot;REPÚBLICA DE EL SALVADOR EN LA AMÉRICA CENTRAL&quot; (). There are two variant flags, one without the coat of arms, and the other with the words &quot;DIOS UNIÓN LIBERTAD&quot; () in bold golden amber in place of the coat of arms. All three contain the same cobalt blue and white stripes, occasionally with a gold Fringe (trim). The main flag has an aspect ratio of 189:335 while the variants are both 3:5.

From 1865 to 1912, a different flag was in use, with a field of alternating cobalt blue and white stripes and a red canton containing stars. The designs of both sides of the flag are different; at the reverse side, it shows the then national coat of arms at the position of stars at obverse. The stars symbolized the provinces of the Republic; once a new province was created, one star was add to the obverse of the flag. This &quot;Star-Striped&quot; banner was considered to be inspired by the flag of the United States.

The blue stripes symbolize the ocean and sky. The white means Peace. Blue is an important color in Salvadoran culture and identity. It started with Native American cultures of Mesoamerica in El Salvador, that produced (añil) indigo plant which they used extracts to produce blue dyes. When the Europeans invaded and colonized the area, they saw the wealth of indigo and turned El Salvador to one of the world&#x27;s foremost providers of indigo dye in its time.

Many other countries in Central America use blue and white colors as a Pan-Central American symbol.

Synonymous to the country&#x27;s wealth, the colonizers referred to the dye as &quot;the blue gold&quot;, that dominated El Salvador&#x27;s economy until it was completely replaced by coffee cultivation. Today El Salvador remains as one of the few countries in the world that still cultivates indigo to produce blue dyes. Over time El Salvador&#x27;s flag has had several different shades of blue, from the lightest to darkest, including Royal blue, Sapphire, Klein Blue and Indigo. The present current modern flag displays a cobalt blue color.

<text>The flag of Equatorial Guinea (; ; ) was adopted on August 21, 1979. The six stars on the flag represent Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s mainland and five islands. Under the rule of dictator Francisco Nguema the flag was modified and a different national emblem was used in it. After he was deposed the original flag was restored.

== Features and symbolism ==

The flag is a horizontal tricolor, with green, white and red stripes and a blue triangle at the hoist. Green symbolizes the natural resources, agriculture and jungles of the country. Blue symbolizes the sea, which connects the mainland with the islands. White symbolizes peace. Red symbolizes the blood shed by the fighters for independence.

== History ==

The flag was first flown the day of independence, October 12, 1968, and it showed the national emblem in the center. However, in 1973, during the regime of Francisco Nguema, a different national emblem was used on the flag. Under Nguema&#x27;s rule, the coat of arms consisted of several tools, a sword and a cockerel. The modified national motto Trabajo (work), and Unidad, Paz, Justicia (Unity, Peace, Justice) was written in two stripes. The original coat of arms was restored after Nguema was deposed on 21 August 1979. The arms consists of a silver shield with a silk-cotton tree, or Ceiba in the local language, which was derived from the arms of Rio Muni. Above the shield is an arc of 6 six-pointed yellow stars, that represent Rio Muni and the offshore islands. Beneath the shield is a silver scroll with the national motto, &quot;Unidad, Paz, Justicia&quot; (&quot;Unity, Peace, Justice&quot;). It is considered that under a silk-cotton tree a treaty was signed between Spain and a local ruler that marked the beginning of the colonial rule.

The flag combines the basic layout and colors from the flag of the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front with an emblem of a wreath and an upright olive branch derived from the Eritrean flag from 1952 to 1962.

The green color in the flag stands for the agriculture and livestock of the country, while the blue represents the bounty of the sea. The red stands for the bloodshed in the struggle for Eritrean independence, with the 30 leaves in the wreath representing the thirty years spent in the struggle for independence.

==History and symbolism==

Eritrea and Ethiopia were both occupied by the Italians between 1935 and 1941. After Italy&#x27;s defeat in the East African Campaign, Ethiopia reverted to its pre-Italian feudal monarchy while Eritrea was handed over to British rule under a mandate by the United Nations in 1949. 
The rise of Arab nationalism during the 1940s prompted the Muslim segment of Eritrea to seek independence from British governance. Simultaneously, Ethiopia aimed to assert control over the Eritrean territory, asserting it as a reclaimed province. Various officials suggested a division of Eritrea: the Christian region to be incorporated into Ethiopia, and the Muslim area into Sudan. Following global deliberations and the involvement of Allied Powers, the United Nations issued a resolution, wherein Britain agreed to establish an autonomous Eritrea in partnership with Ethiopia in 1950.

On September 15, 1952, Eritrea became independent from British rule and was made an autonomous part of Ethiopia. That same year, through their elected representatives, Eritreans settled on the blue flag as their common symbol. The flag was created and designed by Degiat Beyene Zahilay, who was born in Tekonda, Akele Guzay, Eritrea. The &quot;Blue Flag&quot; is passionately referred to as &quot;Khedra&quot; in Tigre and &quot;Awlie&quot; in Tigrinya. 
The flag displayed three olive branches on a blue background: two branches with eleven leaves each, hugging a third branch that carries twelve leaves.

Previously, the unionists had rejected independence and had always yearned to be ruled by Haile Selassie, but throughout the federal period, they continued identifying themselves with the Ethiopian flag, and sabotaging the federal arrangement. Soon, Emperor Haile Selassie began to openly violate and abolish the federal arrangement; he dissolved the Eritrean parliament and outlawed the Eritrean flag which he lowered and hoisted the Ethiopian flag in its place, practically occupying Eritrea militarily. The lowering of the flag sparked the lengthy armed struggle by Eritreans for self-determination and the Eritrean flag continued to be a crucial symbol of Eritrean nationalism.

The propaganda of the Unionist Party aggressively targeted the blue flag. To them, it was the &quot;flag of the United Nations.&quot; At the same time, the Ethiopian Flag was promoted as one belonging to Janhoi, Haile Selassie, the elect of God. While the Ethiopian flag was given a divine value, the Eritrean flag was portrayed as one belonging to the shifta and Arab sellouts who betrayed their &quot;Mother Ethiopia,&quot; and they worked hard to separate the child (Eritrea) from its mother (Ethiopia). At later stages, it became difficult for some who had been raised on this propaganda to accept the blue flag. The blue Eritrean flag had been decided upon and approved by the founding fathers. Furthermore, all Eritrean parties that represented the entire social and political forces of the country, including the pan-Ethiopianist Union party, participated in the negotiations and accepted the flag as a unifying symbol of Eritrea.

On September 1, 1961, Hamid Idris Awate brought back the blue flag suppressed by Haile Selassie. Eritrean nationalists saw it as representing their dreams and as the magnet that pulled all Eritreans together.

After civil war broke out in Eritrea in 1961, Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie banned the Eritrean flag, coat of arms, and all other government seals from being displayed in public places. He annexed Eritrea in 1962 with the approval of the United Nations.

The blue and green Eritrean flag, however, continued to be in use as the &quot;flag of liberation&quot;, by the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF). When the EPLF officially came to being, it proposed its own flag during the front&#x27;s First Organizational Congress in 1977.

The current flag of Eritrea bears resemblance to the party&#x27;s official flag. The flag had three triangles: red, blue, and green. The yellow star in the red triangle symbolized the country&#x27;s rich mineral resources, with the five points representing unity, liberation, justice, democracy, and progress. After Eritrea was proclaimed an independent nation, the flag was modified and its first official hoisting was performed on May 24, 1993. In the red triangle, a gold wreath symbol with 14 leaves on each side, derived from the 1952 flag, replaced the gold star of the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front&#x27;s flag. In 1995 the number of leaves in the wreath were standardized; the 30 leaves symbolise the number of years spent in civil war before achieving independence. The flag&#x27;s length to breadth ratio was changed from 2:3 to 1:2.

The official currency of Eritrea&#x27;s Nakfa coins issued in 1997 featured six native animals; on the reverse the coins showed a group of Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front&#x27;s fighters raising the national flag and the slogan &quot;Liberty, Equality and Justice&quot; in English language.

==Description==
The flag of Eritrea is dominated by a red isosceles triangle based on the hoist-side pointed toward the fly-side and then divided into two right triangles. The upper triangle is green and the lower triangle is blue with a yellow vertical olive branch encircled by an olive wreath centered on the hoist side of the triangle. The shape of the red triangle broadly mimics the shape of the country. The green stands for the agriculture and livestock of the country, blue for the bounty of the sea, and red for the bloodshed in the struggle for independence with the 30 leaves in the wreath corresponding to the thirty years spent in the struggle. The flag has proportions of 1:2.

<text>The Flag of Ethiopia () consists of a green, yellow, and red tricolour with the national emblem, a golden pentagram on a blue disc, superimposed at the center. While the colors green, yellow, and red in combination held symbolic importance since at least the early 17th century, the modern tricolour was first adopted on 11 October 1897 by Menelik II, and the present flag on 31 October 1996.

== Colors ==
The colors of green, yellow and red were used for the flag of the Ethiopian Empire in 1914. On 11 October 1897, a year after Ethiopia decisively defeated the Kingdom of Italy at the Battle of Adwa, emperor Menelik II ordered the three pennants combined in a rectangular tricolour from top to bottom of red, yellow, and green with the first letter of his own name (the Amharic letter &quot;&quot;) on the central stripe. The letter of Menelik&#x27;s name was removed from the flag after his death in 1913. For unknown reasons, the colour order was flipped - with green on top, red on the bottom, and the yellow remaining in place. The flag&#x27;s tricolour scheme has existed since the early 19th century, and the colours red, yellow, and green carried special importance prior to that. To commemorate its adoption in 1897, Ethiopia celebrates Flag Day on the first Monday of the month of Tikimt (September–October).

The royal flag often featured the emblem of a Lion of Judah, a crowned lion carrying a cross centered in the banner&#x27;s yellow midsection. The flag is understood to be a link between the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the peoples, and the nation that was united. The processional cross carried by the lion was the former flag or symbol of Ethiopia, and has likewise been in use since at least the early 17th century. Whilst red is currently featured at the bottom of the horizontal tricolour, it was on top until the mid-19th century. What the colors symbolise varies depending on point of view. However, generally, red represents the blood spilled in defense of Ethiopia; yellow represents peace and harmony between Ethiopia&#x27;s various ethnic and religious groups; and green is said to symbolise hope, or the land and its fertility. The colors had historically been used by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church (red for faith and power, yellow for the church &amp; peace, and green for natural wealth) prior to their adoption as the colors of the state, likely due to them being easy to produce and common in the Ethiopian landscape. Two French travelers in the 19th century, Ferret and Joseph Galinier, said &quot;red,
green, and yellow are the main colours of manuscript illuminations.&quot;

Upon gaining independence from colonial rule, several newly-established countries in Africa adopted these three colors in homage to Ethiopia&#x27;s resistance against foreign occupation. When adopted by Pan-Africanist polities and organisations for their activities, the colours are often referred to as the Pan-African colours.

=== Symbolism ===

* Pantone 347C
* Pantone Yellow C
* Pantone 032C
* Pantone 2728

== Emblem ==

Prior to 1996, the plain green, yellow and red banner was commonly used as a civil flag. Although a number of different emblems were used by the government since 1974, flags with emblems were uncommonly used in public outside of government usage. The basic colour schematic has remained constant.

The star is yellow on a blue disc which overlaps the green and red stripes. The star testifies to Ethiopia&#x27;s bright future, while the yellow rays which it emits are equidistant and are said to represent the equality of all Ethiopians regardless of race, creed, or sex. In recent years, the government of Ethiopia has taken a conscious effort to increase the usage of the flag with the emblem, which had been seen far less than the plain tricolour. As the plain tricolour was used and seen far more often than either the flag of the Derg or the Lion of Judah flag, this was considered unusual.

In 2009, the Parliament of Ethiopia passed Proclamation 654/2009 (The Federal Flag Proclamation), which prohibited firstly amongst 23 other provisions &quot;use [of] the Flag without its Emblem&quot;, as well as &quot;to deface the Flag by writing or displaying signs, symbols, emblems or picture &quot;, or &quot;to prepare or use the Flag without the proper order of its colors and size or its Emblem.&quot; While most offenses were punishable by a fine of &quot;3000 birr or rigorous imprisonment up to one year&quot;, the first offense, mandating the usage of the emblem, received an increased penalty of &quot;5000 birr or rigorous imprisonment up to one year and six months.&quot; This replaced the 1996 Flag Proclamation, which had made no mention of offenses or penalties.

<doc id="459057" wikidata="Q3378750" url="?curid=459057" title="Phil Collinson">
<text>Philip Collinson (born 26 August 1970) is a British television producer. He was initially an actor, before switching to working behind the cameras in the industry as a script editor and writer on programmes such as &quot;Springhill&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, later becoming the producer of &quot;Peak Practice&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

==Career==

Collinson has produced several series for the BBC, including the comedy drama &quot;Linda Green&quot;, and the first seasons of 1950s-set &quot;Born and Bred&quot; and paranormal thriller &quot;Sea of Souls&quot;. In January 2004, he started work as the tenth full-time in-house producer of the BBC science-fiction programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

While he was an actor, the role of Alexander in the 1999 Channel 4 drama &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; was written especially for him by his friend Russell T Davies. However, after Antony Cotton auditioned for the production team, Davies and his fellow producers felt they had no choice but to offer the role to him instead of Collinson.

Collinson took a break from his &quot;Doctor Who&quot; production responsibilities for part of the 2007 series; Susie Liggat took his place for a month according to issue 372 of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, while Collinson took a holiday. There was some confusion when Collinson&#x27;s break was first announced, with some reports claiming that Collinson was leaving the series. &quot;There was this whole madness last year when it was announced that... Susie was going to produce a couple of episodes,&quot; Collinson told &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; in issue 380, &quot;cos everyone immediately thought that I was leaving, and she was taking over. My friends thought I was seriously ill! Why else would I leave &quot;Doctor Who&quot;?&quot; Collinson&#x27;s holiday coincided with the filming of the two-parter &quot;Human Nature&quot;/&quot;The Family of Blood&quot;; he does however receive an executive producer credit for these episodes. Liggat also produced five episodes of the 2008 series.

Collinson also served as an executive producer on the CBBC &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;.

The BBC confirmed on 1 February 2008 that Collinson would be leaving his position on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, to return to Manchester as BBC Head of Drama for the region. After less than two years in this role, it was announced in late 2009 than Collinson would be leaving the BBC to take over as producer of ITV&#x27;s top-rated soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

Collinson is gay, and admits that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has a special appeal for LGBT people: &quot;I can only talk for myself, and when I was a teenager,&quot; he said in a March 2007 interview. &quot;For me, as a young boy and a teenager, growing up in the north of England, in a world where I could never imagine being a gay man, let alone settling down and finding someone, I think &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was really asexual. There were programmes like &quot;The Sweeney&quot; which were very much about men chasing women, men getting women, whereas with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; you had a show that never really dealt with that.&quot; In September 2024, he married Peter Hughes.

In July 2010 Collinson took over from Kim Crowther, as the new producer of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. His first credited episode aired on 26 July 2010.

On 8 October 2012, it was announced that Collinson will step down as Producer of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as of March 2013 and be replaced by &quot;Emmerdale&quot; Producer Stuart Blackburn.

On 20 January 2022, it was confirmed Collinson would return to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as a producer, working again under Russell T Davies.

<text>The current flag of the Falkland Islands was adopted on 25 January 1999 and consists of a defaced Blue Ensign, with the Union Flag in the canton and the Falkland Islands coat-of-arms in the fly.

==History==

The Falkland Islands have been claimed and occupied by several nations throughout its history, who generally used their national flags on the islands. It was not until 1876 that the islands were given a flag of their own, which consisted of a Blue Ensign defaced with the seal of the islands - an image of HMS &quot;Hebe&quot; (which brought many of the early British settlers to the islands, including Richard Moody, in the 1840s) in Falkland Sound, overlooked by a bullock (representing feral cattle which once roamed the islands). A new coat-of-arms for the islands was introduced on 16 October 1925, consisting of the &quot;Desire&quot; (which was captained by John Davis who is reputed to have discovered the islands in 1592) and a sea lion in a shield surrounded by the motto of the islands, &quot;Desire the Right&quot;. This coat-of-arms later replaced the image of the bullock and ship on the flag.

On 29 September 1948, the flag was updated to include the new coat-of-arms (a ram above the &quot;Desire&quot; on shield with the motto below) superimposed upon a white disc. The flag was banned by the Argentine military junta from 2 April – 14 June 1982, during their occupation of the islands, when it was replaced by the flag of Argentina.

In 1999 the size of the arms was increased and the white disc removed to create the current flag. The Falkland Islands Red Ensign was created by The Merchant Shipping (Falkland Islands Colours) Order 1998, No. 3147 of 1998, which came into force in 1999 and which contains a picture of the ensign containing the Falkland arms on a white disc. Red Ensign with the Falklands coat of arms superimposed is used as the islands&#x27; civil ensign. Previously the plain red ensign was used by ships in the territorial waters around the Falklands.

The Governor of the Falkland Islands uses a Union Flag defaced with the coat of arms. It was this flag that was raised at Government House in Stanley by the Royal Marines at the end of the Falkland War, signifying the liberation of the islands.

==Use of the flag==
Since its approval, the Falklands flag has been used to represent the Falkland Islanders internationally.

The flag was flown from several HM Government buildings in London, including 10 Downing Street and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Whitehall, on 14 June 2012 to mark the 30th anniversary of the islands&#x27; liberation.

==Former flags==
==Civil ensign==
For most of the Falkland Islands&#x27; existence as a British territory, the civil ensign was the same as that of the United Kingdom, an undefaced red ensign. In 1998, the first warrant for the use of a defaced red ensign was issued, to be effective on 25 January 1999. This warrant prescribed the coat of arms of the Falkland Islands within a white disc. However, a revision of territorial flags issued later that year removed the white disc and enlarged the coat of arms.
==Governor&#x27;s flag==
==Military flag==
The flag of the British Forces South Atlantic Islands (which is responsible for the security of the Falkland Islands) consists of a tricolour of dark blue (representing the Royal Navy), red (representing the British Army), and light blue (representing the Royal Air Force), which is defaced in the centre with a motif of the Islands in gold.

<doc id="459062" wikidata="Q4575" url="?curid=459062" title="Flag of the Faroe Islands">
<text>The flag of the Faroe Islands (in Faroese: &quot;Merkið&quot; ) is an offset cross, representing Christianity. It is similar in design to other Nordic flags – a tradition set by the &quot;Dannebrog&quot; of Denmark, of which the Faroe Islands are an autonomous territory.

The flag is called Merkið, which means &quot;the banner&quot; or &quot;the mark&quot;. It resembles the flags of neighbouring Norway and Iceland.

==Description and symbolism==
The design of the flag incorporates a red Nordic cross, which is offset to the left. The red cross is fimbriated azure and is set on a white field. The flag design closely resembles that of the Norwegian flag, with the fimbriated cross and the same proportions, 6-1-2-1-6 and 
6-1-2-1-12.

White symbolises the foam of the sea and the pure, radiant sky of the Faroe Islands, while the old Faroese blue and red colours are reminiscent of other Scandinavian and Nordic flags, representing the Faroe Islands&#x27; bonds with other Nordic countries.

===Colours===
The specific colours of the flag are defined in a 1959 law.

==History==
The modern Faroese flag was devised in 1919 by Jens Oliver Lisberg and others while they were studying in Copenhagen. The first time Merkið was raised in the Faroe Islands was on 22 June that year in Fámjin on the occasion of a wedding. On 25 April 1940, the British occupation government approved the flag for use by Faroese vessels, during the tenure of Carl Aage Hilbert as Danish prefect. Britain did not want the same flag as German-occupied Denmark to be used. April 25 is still celebrated as &quot;Flaggdagur&quot;, and it is a national holiday. With the Home Rule Act of 23 March, 1948, the flag was recognized by the Danish Government as the national flag of the Faroes. The original flag is displayed in the church of Fámjin in Suðuroy.

<doc id="459067" wikidata="Q182514" url="?curid=459067" title="Flag of Fiji">
<text>The national flag of Fiji was adopted on 10 October 1970. The state arms have been slightly modified but the flag has remained the same as during Fiji&#x27;s colonial period. It is a defaced cyan &quot;Blue Ensign&quot; (the actual Blue Ensign version of the flag is the government ensign), with the shield from the national coat of arms. It has remained unchanged since Fiji was declared a republic in 1987, despite calls from some politicians for changes.

A plan to change the flag, announced by Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama in 2013, was abandoned in August 2016.

==Design==
The flag&#x27;s bright blue background symbolises the Pacific Ocean, which plays an important part in the lives of the islanders, both in terms of the fishing industry, and the huge tourist trade. The Union Jack reflects the country&#x27;s links with the United Kingdom. The shield is derived from the country&#x27;s coat of arms, which was granted by royal warrant in 1908. It is a white shield with a red cross and a red chief (upper third of a shield). The images depicted on the shield represent agricultural activities on the islands, and the historical associations with the United Kingdom. At the top of the shield, a British lion holds a cocoa pod between its paws. The first quarter is sugar cane, the second quarter is a coconut palm, the third quarter is a dove of peace, and the fourth quarter is a bunch of bananas.

The flag is very similar to the colonial ensign used prior to independence, the main differences being the latter used a darker shade of blue and displayed the entire Fijian coat of arms as opposed to just the shield. While some reformists have called for the removal of the Union Flag, seeing it a British colonial emblem, others support its retention for the sake of historical continuity. The flags of five other independent countries (Australia, Cook Islands, New Zealand, Niue, and Tuvalu) retain the Union Flag in their national flags. But of these, only Fiji is a republic. The Union Flag also remains on the flag of Hawaii, a U.S. state since 1959.

Some influential Fijians have called for the restoration of the full coat of arms to the flag. On 30 November 2005, Fiji&#x27;s Great Council of Chiefs called for the two warrior figures, who guard the shield on the coat of arms, to be placed on the flag, along with a miniature canoe and the national motto, &quot;Rerevaka na kalou ka doka na tui&quot; (&quot;Fear God and honour the Queen&quot;) – symbols that were featured on the original flag of the Kingdom of Viti, the first unified Fijian state created under the leadership of Seru Epenisa Cakobau in 1871.

&quot;The coat of arms is very significant because it has the word of God, then it has the two warriors and the Fijian canoe also. I think that the council members prefer that the full coat of arms be included in the Fiji flag,&quot; said Asesela Sadole, General Secretary of the Great Council of Chiefs.

Prior to ceding the country to British rule in 1874, the government of Fiji adopted a national flag featuring blue and white vertical stripes, with in the centre a red shield depicting a white dove. This flag ceased to be used when the colonial era began and Fiji relinquished its independence. Fiji was a British colony from 1874 to 1970.

== Colour scheme ==
Note: as there is no official shade, the blue colour has been variously described as Pantone 2915 C, Pantone 549C and Pantone 298C.
==Proposal for a new flag==
In his New Year&#x27;s Day address in 2013, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama announced that the flag would soon be changed so as &quot;to reflect a sense of national renewal, to reinforce a new Fijian identity and a new confidence in being Fijian on the global stage&quot;. The change in the flag would accompany the adoption of a new Constitution, intended by Fiji&#x27;s military leader (who came to power in a coup in December 2006) to establish a &quot;one person, one vote&quot;, non-racial and secular democracy under military oversight. The country, a republic, had removed Queen Elizabeth II from its currency a few weeks earlier.

On 3 February 2015, Bainimarama confirmed that the flag of Fiji would be replaced. He announced that a national competition to design the new flag would be held, with the aim of hoisting this flag on 11 October 2015, the 45th anniversary of independence.

During the competition, over 2,000 designs were submitted, before a final shortlist of 23 was selected by Fiji&#x27;s National Flag Committee on 9 June 2015. It was intended to submit these designs to the Cabinet for consideration on 30 June 2015, following a brief public feedback period. However, on 30 June, Bainimarama announced that this feedback period was to be extended to 31 December 2015, saying, &quot;(People) want more time to consider what form the new flag should take... By extending the deadline, there is now ample opportunity for Fijians of all ages and backgrounds to further contribute and consider what symbols most appropriately represent our wonderful nation.&quot;

On 24 December 2015, the Fijian government announced that it had again put off a decision on the country&#x27;s new flag via delaying the next stage by another two months to the end of February 2016. In a statement, the government said that it had now received new submissions since it released 23 designs earlier in 2015, and that it was still seeking more. Furthermore, it was announced that five designs would be chosen through the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office in March 2016, with the public then having three months to select one. The government also said it expected to announce the new flag on 1 July 2016 or at a later date, and that it planned to raise the new flag on Constitution Day, 7 September 2017 (a new public holiday celebrating the 2013 Constitution of Fiji).

However, on 17 August 2016, Bainimarama publicly announced that the government was abandoning plans to change the flag. He read out a statement saying: &quot;While I remain convinced personally that we need to replace some of the flag’s colonial symbols with a genuinely indigenous expression of our present and our future, it has been apparent to the Government since February that the flag should not be changed for the foreseeable future&quot;. The flag&#x27;s popularity had been boosted by the country winning its first ever Olympic gold medal under its banner in the 2016 Summer Olympics. The decision to retain the current flag was welcomed by opposition parties.

===2005 proposal===

On 30 November 2005, Fiji&#x27;s Great Council of Chiefs called for the restoration of the country&#x27;s full coat of arms to the flag, including two warrior figures on either side of the shield, along with an outrigger canoe at the top and the national motto, Rerevaka na kalou ka doka na tui (&quot;Fear God and honour the Queen&quot;) below it.

===2015 proposals===
On 3 February 2015, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama confirmed a project to replace the national flag. He announced that a national competition to design the new flag would be held, with the aim of hoisting this flag on 11 October 2015, the 45th anniversary of independence. During the competition, over 2,000 designs were submitted, before a final shortlist of 23 was selected by Fiji&#x27;s National Flag Committee on 9 June 2015. However, on 17 August 2016, Bainimarama publicly announced that the government was abandoning plans to change the flag. The decision was directly caused by the country&#x27;s winning of its first ever Olympic gold medal that month, which spurred celebrations using the current flag.

<doc id="459078" wikidata="Q101769" url="?curid=459078" title="Flag of Gabon">
<text>The flag of Gabon () is a tricolour consisting of three horizontal green, yellow, and blue bands. Adopted in 1960 to replace the previous colonial flag containing the French Tricolour at the canton, it has been the flag of the Gabonese Republic since the country gained independence that year. The design of the present flag entailed the removal the Tricolour and the widening of the yellow stripe at the centre.

==History==
The French gained control of modern-day Gabon in 1839, when a local chief surrendered the sovereignty of his land to them. The Berlin Conference of 1885 solidified France&#x27;s claim to the territory through diplomatic recognition, and it later became part of French Equatorial Africa in 1910. Under French colonial rule over Gabon, the authorities forbade the colony from utilizing its own distinctive colonial flag. This was because they were worried that this could increase nationalistic sentiment and lead to calls for independence. However, with the rise of the decolonization movement in Africa, the French were obliged to grant limited autonomy to Gabon as a self-governing republic within the French Community. This was granted in 1958 after a referendum was held supporting the proposal.

Gabon – considered &quot;one of the more progressive&quot; of French colonies – swiftly formulated a design for a new flag, which was officially adopted a year later in 1959. It featured a horizontal tricolour identical to the current flag, but with the yellow stripe at the centre narrower than the green and blue bands surrounding it. The French Tricolour was situated at the canton of the flag, making Gabon the only French autonomous republic to feature this &quot;symbolic link&quot; with France.

On 9 August 1960 – just over a week before Gabon became an independent country on 17 August – the flag was slightly modified. The change entailed removing the Tricolour at the canton and enlarging the yellow stripe at the centre, thus giving it equal width with the two other bands.

==Design==
===Symbolism===
The colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The yellow alludes to the Equator – which cuts across the country – and also symbolizes the sun. The green epitomizes the natural resources of Gabon, as well as its &quot;extensive forested area&quot; that the Gabonese people are economically dependent on in the form of lumber. The blue represents the sea, specifically the South Atlantic Ocean along which the country has an &quot;extensive coast&quot;. While Whitney Smith in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and Dorling Kindersley&#x27;s &quot;Complete Flags of the World&quot; describe the centre band as solely yellow, &quot;The World Factbook&quot; characterizes it as both yellow and gold.

===Distinctiveness===
The proportions of Gabon&#x27;s flag are 3:4. This uncommon flag ratio, which is enshrined by Gabonese law, is shared by the flags of only three other countries – Democratic Republic of the Congo (some sources state that the proportions are 2:3), Papua New Guinea and San Marino. Furthermore, the country&#x27;s flag does not utilize the green, yellow and red colours of the Pan-Africanist movement, in contrast to its neighbouring countries. Unlike other former French colonies in Africa, the flag consists of a horizontal tricolour, rather than a vertical one modelled after the flag of France.

<doc id="459088" wikidata="Q160676" url="?curid=459088" title="Flag of Ghana">
<text>The national flag of Ghana consists of a horizontal triband of red, yellow, and green. It was designed in replacement of the British Gold Coast&#x27;s Blue Ensign.

The flag, which was adopted upon the independence of the Dominion of Ghana on 6 March 1957, was designed that same year by Theodosia Okoh, a renowned Ghanaian artist and teacher. The flag was flown from the time of Ghana&#x27;s independence until 1962, then reinstated in 1966 after Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown by coup d&#x27;état. in February 1966. The flag of Ghana consists of the Ethiopian Pan-African colours of red, gold, and green in horizontal stripes with a black five-pointed star in the centre of the gold stripe. The Ghanaian flag was the second African flag after the flag of the Ethiopian Empire to feature the red, gold, and green colours, although these colours are inverted. The design of the Ghanaian flag influenced the designs of the flags of Guinea-Bissau (1973) and São Tomé and Príncipe (1975).

== Design ==

The Ghanaian flag was designed as a tricolour of red, gold and green with a black star in the centre.

The red colour of the flag represents the blood of forefathers who led the struggle of independence from British colonial rule. This claimed the lives of the &#x27;big six&#x27;, Ghanaian leaders Edward Akufo Addo, Dr. Ako Adjei, William Ofori Atta, Joseph Boakye Danquah, Emmanuel Obetsebi Lamptey, and later Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, who formed the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), an anti-colonialist political party. Red is also interpreted to stands for the love of the Ghanaian nation.

The gold colour represents the wealth imbued by mineral resources mostly found in Obuasi in Ashanti Region and Tarkwa in the Western Region. The gold in Ghana led to the initial name of the Gold Coast, which was later changed to Ghana upon independence in 1957. Ghana&#x27;s other mineral resources are diamond, bauxite, and manganese.

The green symbolises Ghana&#x27;s forests and natural wealth which provide the nation with oil, food, and crops such as cocoa, timber, Shea Butter. Most of Ghana&#x27;s crops are exported to overseas countries in exchange for physical cash which is used for the country&#x27;s development of roads, schools, water, sanitation and industries for employment.

The black star of the Ghanaian national flag is a symbol for the emancipation of Africa and unity against colonialism. The black star was adopted from the flag of the Black Star Line, a shipping line incorporated by Marcus Garvey which operated from 1919 to 1922. It became also known as the Black Star of Africa. It is also where the Ghana national football team derived their nickname, the &quot;Black Stars&quot;.

== Ghana&#x27;s struggle for independence before the national flag ==

Ghana was one of the countries counted among the West African regions under colonial government rule from the 15th to 19th centuries on the Gold Coast. The history of Ghana can therefore be traced back to the 15th century when Europeans arrived in the region. The Portuguese navigators sailed their way down the West African coast and to the shores of the Gold Coast in 1471, where they built a castle for themselves at Elmina in 1482. The Europeans brought gold cargo to the shores of the Gold Coast where they traded in gold with the Akwamus and Denkyira who controlled an extensive part of the coast and the forest belt in the 17th century.

In the 18th century, the dominance of the Ashanti Empire of Kumasi took over the gold trade with the British, Dutch and Danes who were the main European traders at the Tano and Volta rivers. The most valuable commodity for exports at the time changed from gold to slaves. Slaves were traded for muskets besides other Western commodities. The Ashantes by then were locally empowered to take control with the Asantehene enthroned on a golden stool as a tradition of the Ashantes. Between 1804 and 1814, the British, Dutch and Danes subsequently outlawed the slave trade, which proved to be a major blow to the Ashanti economy. Because of the situation, wars were fought in 1820, 1824 and 1870, they were subsequently defeated by British forces who shortly thereafter occupied the region of Kumasi in 1874. The British gradually emerged in the coastal regions as the main European power.

The colonial period started from 1902 to 1957. The Ashante Kingdom in 1902 was declared a British crown colony and became the protectorate of the northern territory of the Gold Coast. The colonial government ruled the colony without the involvement of the African populace in the political process. After World War II, the Gold Coast colony became prominent among the Sub-Saharan African countries. It was when Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah returned to the Gold Coast in 1947 after twelve years of political study in the US and Great Britain. The return to the Gold Coast was an invitation for Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah to lead the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) as the General Secretary to lead the campaign for self-government. The UGCC at the time had won the right of the African majority in the British legislative colony. With the leadership of Kwame Nkrumah, a widespread riot began in February 1948.

Within the same year, the founding leaders of the UGCC arrested Secretary General Dr. Kwame Nkrumah for an alert of thoughts against Nkrumah&#x27;s leadership plans. The incident brought a split of the UGCC leadership with Kwame Nkrumah having to found his own Convention People&#x27;s Party (CPP) in June 1949 for the aim of self-governance for the African people, dubbed &quot;Self-government now&quot;. A non-violent campaign of protest and strikes was organised by Kwame Nkrumah in 1950 to achieve his goal. But the riot led to the second arrest of Kwame Nkrumah. The colony&#x27;s general election brought a big win to the Convention People&#x27;s Party in the absence of Kwame Nkrumah, leading to the release of Kwame Nkrumah from prison to join in the governance of the country. Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah then became the Prime Minister of the Gold Coast in 1952. In a vote of the 1956 direct vote of all the electorate members, the British Togoland voted to join the Gold Coast in the campaign for preparations towards independence. The Togo and Gold Coast territories attained independence from colonial rule in 1957 under the supreme willpower of Kwame Nkrumah. The name for the country Ghana was then adopted.

The years of independence of the Gold Coast started in 1957 with the new name of the country of Ghana emerged. Independence was granted and announced by the then Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah who led the struggle for independence. With Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah as the first President of Ghana, Ghana became a Republic within the Commonwealth of Nations on 1 July 1960.

== Theodosia Okoh (The national flag&#x27;s designer) ==

Theodosia Salome Abena Kumea Okoh was a renowned Ghanaian artist who has contested and showcased her artistic internationally. She joined the Ghana Hockey Association (GHA) and worked in the role of a chairperson. She was also a patron of the Sports Writer&#x27;s Association of Ghana (SWAG).

== Purpose and use of the Ghanaian national flag ==

The purpose of the Ghanaian national flag was to be a symbol of jubilation during the post-independence era. There were many flags ensembled for Ghana&#x27;s use. Notably, the Ghanaian national flag described which has been used for many purposes in national and international celebrations, such as the Independence Day Celebration, commemoration of Ghana&#x27;s Big Six and past leaders of the nations. The flag is raised up flying in the sky to grace glorious occasions while it is usually lowered to fly halfway to show some kind of misfortune that may have hit on the country.

==National ensign==

Under terms of section 183 of Ghana&#x27;s Merchant Shipping Act of 1963, the civil ensign is a red flag with the national flag in a black-fimbriated canton. In 2003, a new merchant shipping act was enacted, however, and this simply provides that &quot;the National Flag of Ghana&quot; is the proper national colours for Ghanaian ships. No mention is made of other flags or other possible flags.

The naval ensign is a red St. George&#x27;s Cross on white flag, with the national flag in canton.

==Air force ensign and civil air ensign==

The Ghana Air Force has its own ensign that incorporates the flag of Ghana. Civil aviation in Ghana is represented by the national civil air ensign. It is a standard light-blue field with the Ghanaian flag in the canton. It is charged in the fly with either a red, yellow and green roundel (in the case of the military ensign) or black five-pointed star (in the case of the civil ensign). Both have been used since Independence in 1957, and the subsequent founding of the Ghana Air Force in 1959.

==History==

The Ghanaian government flag, adopted in 1957, was flown until 1962. Similarly, when the country formed the Union of African States, the flag of the Union was modeled on Bolivia&#x27;s flag, but with two black stars, representing the nations. In May 1959, a third star was added.

Following the January 1964 constitutional referendum, Ghana adopted a variant of the 1957 tricolour with white in the place of yellow, after the colours of Kwame Nkrumah&#x27;s ruling and then-sole legal party Convention People&#x27;s Party, making it similar to the flag of Hungary. The original 1957 flag was reinstated in February 1966 following Nkrumah&#x27;s overthrow in the February 1966 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;.

When the flag was changed in 1964, popular public demand upon the remembrance of Ghana&#x27;s rich history agitated for the nation to revert to its use of the original Ghanaian national flag with the red, gold and green colour. The original Ghana national flag which was used in 1957 upon Ghana&#x27;s independence was reinstated for use in 1966. Ghana was then one of the first countries to adopt the Pan African colours originally used in the Ethiopian flag.

<doc id="459095" wikidata="Q103414" url="?curid=459095" title="Flag of Grenada">
<text>The flag of Grenada consists of two yellow triangles at the top and bottom and two green triangles at the hoist and fly. These are surrounded by a red border charged with six five-pointed yellow stars – three at the top centre and three at the bottom centre – along with an additional star on a red disc at the centre and a nutmeg at the hoist triangle. Adopted in 1974 to replace the temporary design used since the islands became an Associated State of the United Kingdom, it has been the flag of Grenada since the country gained independence that year. The representation of a nutmeg is symbolic of the islands&#x27; primary export, and was the one feature from the previous flag that was preserved.

==History==
Sovereignty over Grenada changed hands between the French and the British throughout the 18th century. This continued until 1783, when the Peace of Paris saw France permanently relinquish the island to the United Kingdom. It eventually became a crown colony within the latter&#x27;s colonial empire in 1877. The territory joined the West Indies Federation in 1958 and was a member state until 1962. On 3 March 1967, five years after the federation was dissolved, Grenada became an Associated State. This gave Grenada full control over domestic matters, while Britain retained responsibility for the territory&#x27;s foreign affairs and defence. A new flag for the territory was adopted, though this was only intended to be a temporary design. It consisted of a horizontal tricolour of blue, yellow, and green bands, charged with a nutmeg at the centre.

Negotiations for independence commenced after the Grenada United Labour Party won the most seats in the election in August 1967, having campaigned in favour of sovereignty. A search for a national flag began soon after. The new design was created by Anthony C. George, a native Grenadian from Soubise in Saint Andrew Parish. It eschewed the commonly-used arrangement of a horizontal or vertical tricolour, while maintaining the nutmeg symbol from the previous flag. The new flag was hoisted at midnight on 7 February 1974, the day Grenada became an independent country, and was adopted by the government the same day.

==Design==
The colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The green epitomises the islands&#x27; vegetation and agriculture, while the yellow evokes the sun, as well as the warmth and wisdom of Grenadians. The red represents harmony, unity, courage, and vitality. 

The yellow stars on the red border symbolise the country&#x27;s parishes, while the yellow star on the red disc at the centre signifies its two sister islands, Carriacou and Petite Martinique which are counted as the country’s seventh parish. The symbol of a nutmeg at the hoist alludes to one of the primary agricultural exports of the islands. The country is the second-largest producer of nutmeg in the world, trailing only Indonesia. Consequently, Grenada has acquired the nicknames of &quot;Isle of Spice&quot; and &quot;Spice Island&quot;.

==Variants==
The civil ensign (for merchant ships) is identical in design to the national flag, but has an aspect ratio of 1:2 (instead of 3:5). The naval ensign is based on the British white ensign, a red cross on a white field, with the addition of the national flag in the canton.

==Protocol==
Advice regarding flag etiquette is listed on the official website of the government, as well as on the websites of the country&#x27;s embassies. When displayed together with the flags of other sovereign nations, the foreign flag should not be flown on top of or to the right (i.e. observer&#x27;s left) of the Grenadian flag. The only exception to this recommendation is at foreign diplomatic missions on the island, which is also the only place where a foreign flag can be flown without the flag of Grenada accompanying it. When displayed together with domestic flags, the national flag has to be situated at the centre and be the tallest one of the group. The Grenadian flag should not be smaller in size compared to other flags being flown adjacent to it. When carried in a procession, it should be located on the marching right (in a single file) or at the front of the centre (if there is more than one line).

The guidelines also state that the flag is not to touch the ground, nor should it be dipped towards an individual or an object. It has to be displayed either in or near every polling place when elections in Grenada are held. The national flag should be flown by merchant ships that are registered in the country, but should not be placed on top of motor vehicles (other than by the police force and during state events). It is not to be reproduced for commercial purposes without prior approval from the government. When it becomes damaged and is no longer fit to be publicly displayed, it is permissible to dispose of the national flag via burning.

<text>HMS &quot;Goliath&quot; was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the British Royal Navy and a member of the . Intended for service in Asia, &quot;Goliath&quot; and her sister ships were smaller and faster than the preceding s, but retained the same battery of four guns. She also carried thinner armour, but incorporated new Krupp steel, which was more effective than the Harvey armour used in the &quot;Majestic&quot;s. &quot;Goliath&quot; was laid down in January 1897, launched in March 1898, and commissioned into the fleet in March 1900.

The ship was deployed to the China Station from her commissioning until 1903, when she returned to Britain; she was sent back to East Asian waters, but while en route was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet. In early 1906, she was transferred to the Channel Fleet, followed by a stint in the Home Fleet starting in early 1907. She was sent to the Mediterranean a second time in 1908, and later returned to the Home Fleet in 1909, before being decommissioned in 1913. With the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, &quot;Goliath&quot; was mobilised into the 8th Battle Squadron. She initially served as a guard ship in Loch Ewe, one of the harbours used by the Grand Fleet, before escorting the crossing of British troops to Belgium in late August.

&quot;Goliath&quot; then took part in operations against German East Africa, participating in the blockade of the German light cruiser in the Rufiji River. From March 1915, she was part of the Dardanelles Campaign, and remained in support of the landings at Gallipoli in April. On 13 May 1915 &quot;Goliath&quot; was sunk in Morto Bay off Cape Helles by three torpedoes from the Ottoman destroyer . Out of her crew of 750, 570 were killed in the sinking.

==Design==


&quot;Goliath&quot; and her five sister ships were designed for service in East Asia, where the new rising power Japan was beginning to build a powerful navy, though this role was quickly made redundant by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902. The ships were designed to be smaller, lighter and faster than their predecessors, the s. &quot;Goliath&quot; was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 682 officers and ratings.

The &quot;Canopus&quot;-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. They were the first British battleships with water-tube boilers, which generated more power at less expense in weight compared with the fire-tube boilers used in previous ships. The new boilers led to the adoption of fore-and-aft funnels, rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous British battleships. The &quot;Canopus&quot;-class ships proved to be good steamers, with a high speed for battleships of their time— from —a full two knots faster than the &quot;Majestic&quot;s.

&quot;Goliath&quot; had a main battery of four 35-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading, although at a fixed elevation. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 40-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull, two on each broadside near the forward and aft barbette.

To save weight, &quot;Goliath&quot; carried less armour than the &quot;Majestic&quot;s— in the belt compared to —although the change from Harvey armour in the &quot;Majestic&quot;s to Krupp armour in &quot;Goliath&quot; meant that the loss in protection was not as great as it might have been, Krupp armour having greater protective value at a given weight than its Harvey equivalent. Similarly, the other armour used to protect the ship could also be thinner; the bulkheads on either end of the belt were thick. The main battery turrets were 10 in thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had 12 in thick sides as well. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively.

==Operational history==
===Pre-First World War===
The keel for &quot;Goliath&quot; was laid down on 4 January 1897, and the completed hull was launched on 23 March 1898. The ship was commissioned on 27 March 1900 by Captain Lewis Edmund Wintz to serve on the China Station, where she arrived later the same year. She underwent a refit at Hong Kong from September 1901 – April 1902. Captain Frank Hannam Henderson was appointed in command 11 July 1902. She left the China Station in July 1903 and returned home, where she paid off into the commissioned Reserve at Chatham Dockyard on 9 October 1903. While in reserve, &quot;Goliath&quot; underwent a refit at Palmers on the Tyne from January–June 1904, then participated in maneuvers later in the year. On 9 May 1905, &quot;Goliath&quot; returned to full commission at Chatham to relieve her sister ship on the China Station. However, Great Britain and Japan ratified a treaty of alliance while she was on her outbound voyage, allowing the Royal Navy to reduce its presence on the China Station and recall all battleships from those waters; when &quot;Goliath&quot; reached Colombo, Ceylon in June 1905, she was recalled, and was instead attached to the Mediterranean Fleet. In January 1906, she was transferred to the Channel Fleet.

After being fitted with fire control, &quot;Goliath&quot; transferred to the Portsmouth Division of the new Home Fleet on 15 March 1907. She was based at Portsmouth, and underwent a machinery overhaul there from August 1907 – February 1908. Upon completion of her refit, &quot;Goliath&quot; commissioned on 4 February 1908 for Mediterranean Fleet service. During her voyage to Malta, one of her propeller shafts fractured, and she required four-month repair period before she could begin her service. On 20 April 1909, she paid off at Portsmouth. On 22 April, &quot;Goliath&quot; recommissioned to serve in the 4th Division, Home Fleet, at the Nore. During this service, she was refitted at Chatham in 1910–1911 and was sent to Sheerness. In 1913, she was mothballed and joined the 3rd Fleet.

===First World War===
When the First World War broke out in August 1914, &quot;Goliath&quot; returned to full commission and was assigned to the 8th Battle Squadron, Channel Fleet, operating out of Devonport. She was sent to Loch Ewe as guard ship to defend the Grand Fleet anchorage, and then covered the landing of the Plymouth Marine Battalion at Ostend, Belgium on 25 August 1914. For this operation, she and three other battleships—, , and —a protected cruiser, and six destroyers escorted the troopships; at the same time, elements of the Grand Fleet attacked the German patrol line off Heligoland to occupy the German High Seas Fleet.

====Operations off German East Africa====

&quot;Goliath&quot; transferred to the East Indies Station on 20 September to support cruisers on convoy duty in the Middle East, escorting an Indian convoy to the Persian Gulf and German East Africa through October. This included a major troop convoy that left India on 16 October, in company with the battleship . &quot;Goliath&quot;″s arrival allowed cruisers that had been occupied with escorting convoys to join the hunt for the German light cruiser . The German cruiser, having sunk the British cruiser in the Battle of Zanzibar, was trapped by three British cruisers in the Rufiji River delta in late October. &quot;Goliath&quot; arrived shortly thereafter and was to join the blockade of the delta, but the news of the British defeat at the Battle of Coronel on 1 November forced the Admiralty to transfer &quot;Goliath&quot; to South Africa, as it was feared that the German East Asia Squadron might attack the colony after it entered the southern Atlantic. To further complicate matters, &quot;Goliath&quot; had engine problems on arriving in Mombasa, Kenya, and was unable to proceed to South Africa, and instead the armoured cruiser was sent in her place. After her engines were repaired, &quot;Goliath&quot; resumed her previous assignment with the blockade force at the Rufiji delta.

In November, &quot;Goliath&quot; attempted to get close enough to neutralise &quot;Königsberg&quot;, but the water was too shallow to permit her to get within range of the cruiser. As a result, she left to bombard Dar es Salaam on 28 November and 30 November. In the former attack, Commander Henry Ritchie, &quot;Goliath&quot;″s executive officer, won the Victoria Cross. &quot;Goliath&quot; and the protected cruiser destroyed the colonial governor&#x27;s residence; the second bombardment proved to be less effective. &quot;Goliath&quot; underwent a refit at Simonstown, South Africa, from December 1914 to February 1915. She then returned to the Rufiji delta on 25 February, as it seemed from German activities that &quot;Königsberg&quot;″s commander intended to break out soon. During this period, &quot;Goliath&quot; bombarded German positions at Lindi, but she saw no action with &quot;Königsberg&quot;. On 25 March, &quot;Goliath&quot; was ordered to move to the Mediterranean to take part in operations off the Dardanelles, her place being taken by the protected cruiser ; the battleship left East African waters a week later on 1 April.

====Dardanelles campaign====

Upon arrival in the Aegean Sea, &quot;Goliath&quot; joined the First Squadron, which included seven other battleships and four cruisers, and was commanded by Rear Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss. The First Squadron was tasked with supporting the Landing at Cape Helles, which took place on 25 April. On the morning of the landings, &quot;Goliath&quot; took up a position off Y beach, some offshore to provide gunfire support. The protected cruisers and moved in closer, and all three ships opened fire at around 05:00, signalling the start of the attack. The Ottomans made no attempt to disrupt the landing, the Allied forces having successfully launched a surprise attack. By late in the day, however, an Ottoman counterattack had advanced from Krithia to threaten the British flank, but gunfire from &quot;Goliath&quot; and the cruisers broke up the attack. That night, the Ottomans launched another counterattack, this time against the centre of the British line, which was repulsed. Once the sun began to rise, &quot;Goliath&quot; and the cruisers, which had by then been reinforced by the cruisers and , shelled the Ottomans, forcing them to retreat again.

On the morning of 26 April, wounded soldiers began to be ferried off the beach, first to &quot;Goliath&quot; and the cruisers off shore. A miscommunication with the men on shore led to an unintended, larger evacuation effort. In the course of the action, she sustained some damage from the gunfire of Ottoman forts and shore batteries. Later in the day, order was restored on shore, and the Allied troops were able to occupy Sedd el Bahr. The Allies landed reinforcements, which allowed the advance to push toward Krithia on 27 April. &quot;Goliath&quot; and several other battleships shelled Ottoman defenders around the town to support the attack, which began the following morning at around 10:00. &quot;Goliath&quot; moved as close to shore as possible, to employ all of her guns at very close range. Despite the heavy fire support, the Allied troops were unable to dislodge the Ottoman defenders, and the First Battle of Krithia ended in an Allied defeat. &quot;Goliath&quot; was damaged by Ottoman guns again on 2 May.

By mid-May, the Allied fleet had developed a rotation of two battleships on station off Gallipoli every night to support the troops dug in on the peninsula. On the night of 12–13 May, &quot;Goliath&quot; was on station with the battleship . The two ships were moored in Morto Bay, with &quot;Goliath&quot; ahead of &quot;Cornwallis&quot;; five destroyers patrolled the area against Ottoman torpedo boats. The Ottoman destroyer sortied late on 12 May under cover of a moonless night. By steaming very slowly, the Ottomans were able to slip past the destroyer patrols at about 01:00 on 13 May. Fifteen minutes later, lookouts aboard &quot;Goliath&quot; spotted &quot;Muâvenet-i Millîye&quot; and issued a challenge; the Ottomans replied to the challenge but very quickly increased speed and launched three torpedoes at &quot;Goliath&quot;. The British opened fire, but only managed to shoot three rounds before the first torpedo struck the ship. Two torpedoes hit almost simultaneously, the first abreast her fore turret and the second abeam the fore funnel, causing a large explosion. &quot;Goliath&quot; began to capsize almost immediately, and was lying on her side when a third torpedo struck near her after turret. &quot;Muâvenet-i Millîye&quot; sped off and escaped unscathed in the darkness as the other British warships gathered to rescue survivors from &quot;Goliath&quot;. Some 570 men, out of a crew of 750 were killed in the sinking, including the ship&#x27;s commander, Captain Thomas Shelford.

The wreck lies upside down at a depth of , and is largely buried in sediment. Only part of the hull, which was badly mangled by the explosion, and one of her screws are visible.

<doc id="459101" wikidata="Q235829" url="?curid=459101" title="Flag of Guam">
<text>The flag of Guam was adopted on February 9, 1948. The territorial flag is a dark blue field with a narrow red border on all sides. The red border – a later addition – represents the blood spilled during World War II and earlier Spanish sovereignty. In the center of the flag is the Seal of Guam; almond in shape, it depicts a proa sailing in Hagåtña Bay near Hagåtña, and &quot;GUAM&quot; in red letters. The shape of the emblem recalls the slingshot stones used by ancient Chamorro people. The landform in the background depicts the Two Lovers Point cliff on the northern edge of Tumon. Charles Alan Pownall, the military Governor of Guam, approved the design in 1948.

As a complement to the Guam flag, and in response to Guam law providing for municipal flags, efforts were made to depict the culture of the island’s 19 municipalities on respective flag. This was collaborated through the Mayors&#x27; Council with the assistance of artist Gerard Aflague, a native of Guam. These municipal flags are to reflect unique aspects of each village.

==Construction details==
The flag of Guam consists of a blue rectangle of by , trimmed on all sides with a wide red border. The coat of arms in the center is twenty-four inches tall and sixteen inches wide.

<doc id="459103" wikidata="Q1044286" url="?curid=459103" title="Kajiki, Kagoshima">
<text>was a town located in Aira District, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. It is located north of the city of Kagoshima. Kajiki is located on the northern part of the bay. Kagoshima Airport is to the north.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 23,364 and the density of 491.87 persons per km2. The total area was 47.50 km2.

On March 23, 2010, Kajiki, along with the towns of Aira (former) and Kamō (all from Aira District), was merged to create the city of Aira. Aira District will be left with one municipality.

It is accessed with the Kyūshū Expressway at Interchange 25-1 along with the Junction and access with another freeway linking to and in the east. The interchange was opened on December 13, 1973, and extended north to Mizobe-Kagoshima Airport on November 29, 1976. On March 25, 1992, a section was opened which became the East Kyūshū Expressway on December 19, 2001, when the expressway became connected.

Kajiki has elementary schools, middle schools, high schools including Kajiki High School (Kajiki Kōkō), one of the top 5 academic schools of Kagoshima. Kajiki&#x27;s main station is Kajiki train station, with a view of Sakurajima. There is also a post office, parks and banks. A river runs slightly west of Kajiki. In the spring time, the park that runs along the river is a popular place for locals to enjoy Hanami (flower watching) BBQs.

Kajiki is well known, in Kagoshima prefecture and even some places outside of Kagoshima, for its Kajiki manju. Kajiki manju is rice dough filled with sweet red bean paste (anko).

Two interesting points to see in Kajiki are Ryumon Falls and a preserved section of a path Saigō Takamori and his men used to walk to Tokyo from Kagoshima. This path has been used in NHK TV programs.

Kajiki is located on a small valley and a plain. The mountains dominate the north and west.

<text>The national flag of Guinea () was adopted on 10 November 1958, with the publication of the country&#x27;s first Constitution.

== Design ==
The colors of the flag were adapted from those of the Rassemblement Démocratique Africain, the dominant movement at the time of independence. The colors were in turn derived from those of the flag of Ghana, which had first adopted them in 1957. Sékou Touré, the first President of Guinea, was a close associate of Kwame Nkrumah, the former president of Ghana.

According to Sékou Touré, first President of Guinea, the three colors of the flag represent the following: red symbolizes the blood of anti-colonialist martyrs, the labor of the working classes, and the wish for progress; yellow represents Guinean gold, as well as the sun, which is &quot;the source of energy, generosity and equality for all men to which he gives light equally&quot;; and green represents the country&#x27;s vegetation, continued prosperity arising from its natural resources, and the historically difficult life of the Guinean masses who live in the countryside. In turn, the symbolism behind each of the three colors corresponds to the three components of the national motto: &quot;Travail, Justice, Solidarité&quot; (&quot;Work, Justice, Solidarity&quot;).

In keeping with other flags in the region, the Pan-African movement&#x27;s colors of red, yellow, and green are used.

The design is a tricolor. The colors of the flag from left to right are the reverse of the flag of Mali. The previous flag of Rwanda (in use from 1961 to 2001), the design of which was inspired by the flag of the Kingdom of Rwanda, had a large black R to distinguish it from the near-identical flag of Guinea.

<doc id="459105" wikidata="Q407947" url="?curid=459105" title="Aira, Kagoshima">
<text>is a city located in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. It is located west of Kirishima and north of Kagoshima. , the city had an estimated population of 77,948 in 38338 households, and a population density of 340 persons per km². The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Aira extends approximately 25 kilometers from north-to-south and approximately 24 kilometers from east-to-west in central Kagoshima Prefecture. Part of the southeast side faces Kagoshima Bay. In the area facing Kagoshima Bay, four rivers flow from the west: the Oshikawa River, the Beppu River, the Amikake River, and the Hikiyama River.The alluvial plains of these rivers come together to form the Aira Plain, which contains the main urban area. Natural beaches remain on the coast leading to Kagoshima City on the west side and the coast near the border with Kirishima City on the east side, but the rest is an artificial coast formed by reclaimed land. The northern part of Aira City is lined with mountains belonging to the Kitasatsu Volcanic Group, and the border with Satsumasendai City on the northwest side almost forms the watershed with the Sendai River basin. A tributary of the Beppu River flows between these mountains, and several villages have developed along it. On the other hand, between Kirishima City and Kirishima City on the northeast side, there is a continuous plateau called Jusanzukahara, and tributaries of the Amikake River and Hikiyama River flow into it from the Kirishima City side.

The border with Kagoshima City on the southwest side is the Muregaoka Mountain Range, which has an altitude of around 500 meters, and drops sharply into the plains of Aira City and the coastline. On the north side of the Muregaoka Mountain Range, the Omoi River flows from the Kagoshima City side, and the relatively low-elevation land connects to the center of the former Yoshida Town, which merged with Kagoshima City. 

A volcano that once existed in the northern part of Kagoshima Bay caused an eruption called the Great Aira Eruption about 25,000 years ago, forming the Aira Caldera. Aira City is located on the northwest side of this caldera, on the somma, and there is a stratum called Shirasu, which originated from pyroclastic flows that flowed out during a large eruption. Other topographical features within the city that originate from volcanic activity include Yonemaru and Sumiyoshi Pond, both of which are said to be marls.

Approximately 65% of Aira&#x27;s area is forested. The central plains are well-developed paddy fields, and the area on the plateau bordering Kirishima City on the northeast is an upland farming area.

===Neighboring municipalities===

*Kagoshima
*Kirishima
*Satsuma
*Satsumasendai

===Climate===
Aira has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The average annual temperature is about , and the annual rainfall is about . Most of the rainfall is concentrated from June to September.

 Typhoons often strike from summer to autumn. In addition, Sakurajima is located about 20 km south of the city, and volcanic ash may fall when a northerly wind blows during volcanic activity. As with other cities, towns and villages in the mainland of Kagoshima Prefecture, the forecast of wind direction over Sakurajima, which is reported in the weather forecast, is of great concern.
===Demography===
According to Japanese census data, this is the population of Aira in recent years.

==History==
The area of Aira was part of ancient Ōsumi Province, and there is evidence of continuous habitation since the Japanese Paleolithic period. The area was a stronghold of the Hayato people, many of whom had migrated to this location after being forced out of their territories in central Kyushu, and was one of the sites of the Hayato Rebellion of 720. In the Heian period, the area came under the control of the Okura clan, who claimed descent from Emperor Ling of Han, whose descendants fled to Japan. The region was contested in the Nanboku-chō period, gradually coming under control of the Shimazu clan in the 15th century. During the Edo Period the area was under the control of Kagoshima Domain. After the Meiji restoration, the villages of Chōsa, Kajiki, Kamō, Mizobe, Shigetomi and Yamada were established in Aira District on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Kajiki gained town status on June 1, 1912 followed by Kamō on November 1, 1928. Kajiki was bombed twice in World War II, killing 43 people, including 14 students from the former Kajiki Junior High School (currently Kagoshima Prefectural Kajiki High School). The town of Aira was established on January 1, 1955 by the merger of the town of Chōsa and village of Shigetomi. Aira, Kajiki, and Kamō merged to form the city of Aira on March 23, 2010.

==Government==
Aira has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 24 members. Aira contributes two members to the Kagoshima Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Kagoshima 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
Aira has a mixed economy centering on agriculture, fishing, forestry and light manufacturing and food processing. 

==Education==
Aira has 19 public elementary schools and five public junior high schools operated by the city government and four public high schools operated by the Kagoshima Prefectural Board of Education. There is also one private elementary school.

<doc id="459106" wikidata="Q171124" url="?curid=459106" title="Flag of Guyana">
<text>The flag of Guyana, known as the Golden Arrowhead, has been the national flag of Guyana since May 1966, when the country became independent from the United Kingdom. It was designed by Whitney Smith, an American vexillologist (though originally without the black and white fimbriations, which were later additions suggested by the College of Arms in the United Kingdom). The proportions of the national flag are 3:5. 

The colours are symbolic:

* red for zeal and dynamism, 
* gold for mineral wealth,
* green for agriculture and forests,
* black for endurance,
* white for rivers and water.

==Other flags==
The civil air ensign is a copy of the British Civil Air Ensign, with the Guyanese flag in the canton. The naval ensign of Guyana is a version of the national flag, with proportions of 1:2.

As part of the British Empire, Guyana&#x27;s flag was a Blue Ensign with the colonial badge in the fly. An unofficial red version was used at sea. The first flag was introduced in 1875 and was changed slightly in 1906 and 1955. Like all British Ensigns, the colonial flags of Guyana were all ratio 1:2.

==Presidential Standards==
The Presidential Standard of Guyana came into effect by Proclamation issued on 23 February 1970. Subsequent Presidents have amended this Proclamation to replace the description of the flag contained, to reflect the Presidential Standard they wish to introduce for the duration of their presidency.

<doc id="459107" wikidata="Q1044295" url="?curid=459107" title="Kamō, Kagoshima">
<text>was a town located in Aira District, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 7,311 and the density of 89.94 persons per km2. The total area was 81.29 km2.

On March 23, 2010, Kamō, along with the towns of Aira (former) and Kajiki (all from Aira District), was merged to create the city of Aira. Aira District will be left with one municipality.
Kamō is home to the oldest Camphor laurel tree (&quot;Cinnamomum camphora&quot;) in Japan. The tree is approximately 1500 years old, and stretches across, and about high. It was heavily damaged in typhoons in 1997 and 2004. A large hollow, with a diameter of , exists inside the tree. This hollow was a favourite resting place for homeless men in Kagoshima until a locked door was installed in April 2000.

The tree, fondly referred to as Ōkusu (大楠, great camphor) by locals, is located on the grounds of Hachiman Jinja, a shinto shrine.

Every November an autumn festival called Donto Matsuri takes place on the grounds of Hachiman Jinja.

==Geography==

The former town is in a valley drained by the Gamou river which flows to the south-east through the conurbation of Aira and into the north-western portion of Kagoshima Bay. To the north are the heights of the Aojiki volcano and hot springs near the plain of Yonemaru. The lake of Sumiyoshiike (Sumiyoshi pond) is to the former town&#x27;s north-east which is north-west of the centre of the Aira conurbation.

===Geology===

To the north of the town/suburb is the basaltic Kamo monogenetic volcanic field with the two maars of Yonemaru and Sumiyoshiike as well as the volcanic hill of Aojiki. The volcanic vents are north-west of the Aira Caldera.

<text>The flag of Haiti () is a bicolour featuring two horizontal bands coloured blue and red, emblazoned by a white rectangular panel bearing the coat of arms of Haiti. The coat of arms depicts a trophy of weapons atop a green hill and a royal palm symbolizing independence. The palm is topped by the Cap of Liberty. The motto (&#x27;Unity makes strength&#x27;) appears on a white ribbon below the arrangement.

==Present design==
===National flag===
The present design was first used by the Republic of Haiti under President Alexandre Pétion in 1806. It was most recently readopted on 25 February 2012 under Title I, Chapter I, Article 3 of the current Constitution of Haiti:L&#x27;emblême de la Nation Haïtienne est le Drapeau qui répond à la description suivante:

The English translation adopted by the Embassy of Haiti in Washington, D.C., reads:The emblem of the Haitian Nation shall be a flag with the following description:
Contrary to the constitutional mandate, the white field is rarely (if ever) rendered as a square. A rectangle with an 11:9 ratio has been adopted by the Haitian Ministry of Information and Coordination since 1987 or earlier.

The flag of Haiti is one of seven national flags whose designs incorporate a depiction of the flag itself, the others being the flags of Bolivia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Venezuela. The flag is one of four national flags of UN member states to feature a gun, the others being those of Mozambique, Guatemala, and Bolivia.

===Civil flag===
The civil flag and ensign omits the coat of arms.

=== Colours scheme ===

==History==
The first purely Haitian flag was adopted on 18 May 1803, on the last day of the Congress of Arcahaie, about north of Port-au-Prince. Haitian lore holds that the newly appointed revolutionary leader Jean-Jacques Dessalines created the flag by taking a French tricolor and ripping out the white center, which he discarded. He then asked Catherine Flon, his god-daughter, to sew the remaining bands together. The white pale removed, the blue was taken to represent Haiti&#x27;s Black African citizens and the red the &quot;gens de couleur&quot;. The story is widely known in Haiti: the anniversary of the date is celebrated as the Flag and Universities Day and images of Catherine Flon have appeared on Haitian currency and stamps.

Following his proclamation as Emperor Jacques I, Dessalines promulgated a new constitution on 20 May 1805. In it, the colors of the flag were altered to black and red. This flag being subsequently adopted by Henri Christophe, the republicans under Alexandre Pétion returned to the colors blue and red, subsequently turning them horizontal and adding the newly adopted Haitian coat of arms.

During the period of the Haitian Empire of Faustin I, his coat of arms was used on the flag and for official functions, but it was subsequently abandoned upon his removal from office.

Until 1937, the flag of Liechtenstein was also plain horizontal blue and red. The match was first noted at the 1936 Summer Olympics, and so Liechtenstein altered its flag by adding a golden crown to the canton. 

Between 1964 and 1986, the family dictatorships of François &quot;Papa Doc&quot; and Jean-Claude &quot;Baby Doc&quot; Duvalier returned to Dessalines&#x27; black and red design. They included the national coat of arms, but altered the flags in its trophy to black as well.

<doc id="459116" wikidata="Q6739775" url="?curid=459116" title="Makizono, Kagoshima">
<text>was a town located in Aira District, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan.

As of June 1, 2005, the town had an estimated population of 9,041 (4,202 men and 4,839 women) and the density of 71.27 persons per km2. The total area was 129.66 km2.

On November 7, 2005, Makizono, along the city of Kokubu, with the towns of Kirishima (former), Fukuyama, Hayato, Mizobe and Yokogawa (all from Aira District), was merged to create the city of Kirishima and no longer exists as an independent municipality.

Some of the first inhabitants of this area were the Kumaso people of the early Jōmon period. Archeological digs in the Manzen district have revealed ancient artifacts most likely used by the Kumaso. Kumaso no Ana in the neighboring town of Hayato (now also part of Kirishima) is a cave thought to have been used by the Kumaso.

The earliest recorded name of Makizono, is Inazumi-go. In Japanese &quot;ina&quot; refers to rice and &quot;zumi&quot; means a vast collection, or a pile. &quot;Go&quot; means village or hamlet. In other words, the area was known for its bountiful rice harvests.

Later texts from the Tokugawa period name the area that is now Makizono, Odori-go. &quot;Odori&quot; is the Japanese word for dancing, and it is said that this name was given to the town by visitors who noted the jovial nature of the local residents. While you rarely see mention of these former names in the current town, the hot spring inn located in the Shukukubota district, Iwaibashi Onsen Inn, has the characters for Odori-go written in large print on the side of their hot spring facilities.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Kirishima is as shown below:

==History==
The area of Kirishima has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The Uenohara site dates from the Jōmon period, and in the Kofun period the area was a stronghold of the Hayato people. In the Nara period, it became the center of ancient Ōsumi Province, and the location of the provincial capital and Provincial temple. The area largely became part of Shimazu &quot;shōen&quot; from the late Heian period, and continued to be ruled by the Shimazu clan throughout the Edo Period.

The modern city of Kirishima was established on November 7, 2005, from the merger of the city of Kokubu, and the towns of Fukuyama, Hayato, Kirishima (former), Makizono, Mizobe and Yokogawa (all from Aira District).

==Government==
Kirishima has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 25 members. Kirishima, collectively with the town of Yūsui, contributes four members to the Kagoshima Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Kagoshima 4th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
Kirishima has a mixed economy. Agriculture still plays a major role, with main specialty products: strawberries, tomatoes, burdock, green onions, buckwheat, leaf tobacco, mandarin oranges, tea, chestnuts, shiitake mushrooms, beef cattle, eel, etc. Local leaf tobacco production is said to have begun in 1606, shortly after tobacco was introduced to Japan. Since then, it has continued to be one of the leading production areas in Japan, but in recent years it has been steadily shrinking. Taking advantage of the geographical conditions resulting from the opening of Kagoshima Airport and the Kyushu Expressway, the city has encouraged high-tech industries such as Sony and Kyocera to build large scale production plants in the area. On the other hand, Kirishima is also a tourist destination, noted for its volcanoes, hot springs and historic sites.

Japan Air Commuter has its headquarters in Kirishima.

<doc id="459119" wikidata="Q5686146" url="?curid=459119" title="Hayato, Kagoshima">
<text>is a town located in Aira District, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2008, the town had an estimated population of 43,844 and the density of 555.30 persons per km2. The total area was 66.49 km2.

On November 7, 2005, Hayato, along with the city of Kokubu, the towns of Kirishima (former), Fukuyama, Makizono, Mizobe and Yokogawa (all from Aira District), was merged to create the city of Kirishima and no longer exists as an independent municipality.

Extract from the Hayato website:

Hayato is located in the center of Kagoshima Prefecture in southern Japan and has a population of 37,000. Covering an area of 66.49 square kilometers, Hayato is a land rich in nature with Kinko Bay to the south and Kirishima mountains to the north. In the nearby waters one can see the small islands of Kamitsukuri floating in the distance, famous for Takachiho Shrine, where the shinto god Hikohohodemi no Mikoto rested in ancient times. Ruins surrounding this as well historical sites of the Kumaso Aborigines, who wielded power anciently in southern Kyushu, offer us many diverse legends and romanticism.

Along the Amori River, which flows through the town, are the Hayato Hot Spring villages (Hinatayama and Myoken Hot Springs), which are well known from days of old and boast abundant hot water of superior quality. In 1984, the Kokubu-Hayato area was designated as a Technopolis and many modern industries have moved into the area. In 1986, Hayato received the designation of Teletopia (meaning telecommunications utopia). Hayato offers an attractive living environment where abundant nature, history and high technology exist side by side.

<doc id="459121" wikidata="Q102939" url="?curid=459121" title="Flag of Honduras">
<text>The flag of Honduras consists of three equal horizontal stripes of cyan, white and cyan, with five cyan stars in a quincuncial pattern at the centre of the middle stripe. The two outer bands represent the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, and also represent the blue sky and brotherhood. The inner band represents the land between the ocean and the sea, the peace and prosperity of its people, and purity of thoughts. The five stars represent the five nations of the former Federal Republic of Central America and the hope that the nations may form a union again.

In 1823, Honduras joined the United Provinces of Central America and adopted its flag. It continued using a plain blue and white triband after the union dissolved in 1838. On 7 March 1866 five blue stars were placed on the flag to represent the five original provinces: El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala.

The 1949 decree specified that the stripes were to be cyan, but in practice the flag remained dark blue for the next seven decades. The Honduran government only began flying turquoise flags after the inauguration of president Xiomara Castro on 27 January 2022, after the National Autonomous University of Honduras made that recommendation in 2021.

Ships of the Honduran Navy fly a naval ensign which has the coat of arms of Honduras above an inverted arch of five small stars and a pendant.

== History ==
=== United Provinces of Central America ===
The origins of the Honduran flag date back to United Provinces of Central America, which Honduras was part of. It was the first country in Central America to use a blue-white-blue triband, which in turn was based on the flag of Argentina

=== First flag ===

Flag used since independence, and finally abolished in 1949. The flag has been defined as flag of the UPOCA without emblem.

=== Second flags ===
On 16 February 1866, President José María Medina modified the coat of arms and flag, adding 5 stars representing the 5 original united provinces. The most popular arrangement of blue stars was similar to the arrangement of the dots on a die, but there were also alternative arrangements. Versions other than the current one disappeared by the 1930s.

Although there wasn&#x27;t any mention regarding the exact shade of blue to be used, the most common version (including the one used by military forces) used navy blue.

==== Greater Republic of Central America ====
Between 1896 and 1898 Honduras was part of a union known as Greater Republic of Central America. Within the union, Honduras still has its own flag. Around this time, an unofficial version with gold stars comes out, sometimes only considered a mistake. The likely reason for this is that the union used gold stars.

=== Third flag ===
On 26 January 1949, President Juan Manuel Gálvez amended the 1866 decree, confirming the position of the stars. The decree also defined the shade of blue used on the stripes and stars as turquoise. However, that change was not implemented and the flag continued to be produced using navy blue for 73 years.

=== Fourth flag ===
In 2020, the National Autonomous University of Honduras published its guidelines regarding the shades of blue used on the flag, due to the &quot;absence&quot; of an official position about the topic. Following the intention of the 1949 decree, the guidelines established a lighter shade of blue for the Honduran flag &quot;until its colors are defined and regulated by legislative decree&quot;.

On 4 August 2023, the Honduran Armed Forces announced a change from this month on their monograms, uniforms and logo to represent the national flag in turquoise. The announcement came shortly after President-elect Xiomara Castro also announced the use of the flag in that shade of blue.

<doc id="459129" wikidata="Q93335" url="?curid=459129" title="Flag of Iceland">
<text>The flag of Iceland () was officially described in Law No. 34, set out on 17 June 1944, the day Iceland became a republic. The law is entitled &quot;The Law of the National Flag of Icelanders and the State Arms&quot; and describes the Icelandic flag as follows:

The civil national flag of Icelanders is blue as the sky with a snow-white cross, and a fiery-red cross inside the white cross. The arms of the cross extend to the edge of the flag, and their combined width is , but the red cross of the combined width of the flag. The blue areas are right angled rectangles, the rectilinear surfaces are parallel and the outer rectilinear surfaces as wide as them, but twice the length. The dimensions between the width and length are 18:25.

Iceland&#x27;s first national flag was a white cross on a deep blue background. It was first shown in parade in 1897. The modern flag dates from 1915, when a red cross was inserted into the white cross of the original flag. This cross historically stems from the symbol of Christianity. It was adopted and became the national flag when Iceland was granted sovereignty by Denmark in 1918. For Icelanders, the flag&#x27;s colouring represents a vision of their country&#x27;s landscape. The colours stand for three of the elements that make up the island. Red is the fire produced by the island&#x27;s volcanoes, white recalls the ice and snow that covers Iceland and blue represents the mountains of the island.

== History ==

According to a legend described in Andrew Evans&#x27; &quot;Iceland&quot;, a red cloth with a white cross fell from the heavens, ensuring Danish victory at the Battle of Valdemar in the 13th century. Denmark then used the cross on its flag throughout its Nordic territories as a sign of divine right. Upon Iceland&#x27;s independence, they continued to use the Christian symbol.

The civil flag of Iceland had been used as an unofficial symbol since the late 19th century, originally as a white cross on a blue background. The current design was adopted on 19 June 1915, when King Kristján X issued a decree allowing it to be flown in Icelandic territorial waters, where only the Danish flag had been permitted, and stipulating that a red cross was to be incorporated into the design to distinguish it from similar foreign flags. Other symbolic meanings refer to the natural features of Iceland itself. Blue is the colour of the mountains when looked at from the coast, white represents the snow and ice covering the island for most of the year, and red the volcanoes on the island.

== Laws regarding the flag ==
On 17 June 1944, the day Iceland became a republic, a law was issued that dealt with the national flag and the coat of arms. To date, this is the only major law to have been made about the flag and coat of arms, aside from two laws made in 1991: one that defines official flag days as well as the time of day the flag can be drawn, and another that defines the specific colours comprising the Icelandic flag. (The law codified what had been common custom.)

The law describes the dimensions of both the common flag and special governmental flags used by embassies and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It also goes into details of usage, such as how the flag should be attached in different situations such as on a flagpole, on a house and on different kinds of ships.

According to the law, using the flag is a privilege and not a right. The owner must follow instructions on its usage and make sure that his or her flag is in mint condition regarding colouring, wear and tear. It also states that no one shall disrespect the flag in act or word, subject to a fine or imprisonment of up to one year.

The original law stated in its seventh article that another law would be set regarding official flag days and the time of day that the flag may be flown, but such a law was not put into effect until almost 50 years later in 1991. This law states that the flag shall not be flown until 7:00 in the morning and it should preferably not be flown beyond sunset but that it must not be flown beyond midnight. However, if the flag is raised at an outdoor assembly, an official gathering, funeral or a memorial the flag may be flown as long as the event lasts though never beyond midnight.

== Icelandic flag days ==
According to Law No. 5 of 23 January 1991, the following are nationally sanctioned flag days. On these days the flag must be raised at official buildings, and those under the supervision of officials and special representatives of the state. Any additions to the list below can be decided each year by the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. On these days, the flag must be fully drawn, except on Good Friday where it must be drawn at half-mast.
* The birthday of the president of Iceland, currently the 11th of October
* New Year&#x27;s Day
* Good Friday
* Easter
* First Day of Summer
* 1 May
* Pentecost
* Sailors Day
* Icelandic National Day
* Icelandic Language Day
* 1 December, Sovereignty Day
* Christmas

==The state flag==

The Icelandic state flag (&quot;Ríkisfáni&quot;), known as the &quot;Tjúgufáni&quot;, was first flown on 1 December 1918 from the house of ministry offices although laws regarding its uses had not been finished. It was not until 12 February 1919 that such a law was enacted.

The State flag is used on governmental buildings and embassies. It is also permitted to use the flag on other buildings, if they are being used by the government in some fashion. The &quot;Tjúgufáni&quot; is the Naval Ensign of the Icelandic Coast Guard as well, and state ships and other ships put to official uses are permitted to use it.

The customs service flag is used on buildings used by the Directorate of Customs and at checkpoints, as well as by ships used by the Directorate of Customs.

The Icelandic presidential flag is used on the dwellings of the President, as well as any vehicles that transports them.

== Colours of the flag ==
Officially, the colours of the Icelandic flag follow a law set in 1991, which states that the colours must be the following Standard Colour of Textile (&quot;Dictionnaire International de la Couleur&quot;) hues:
The government of Iceland has issued colour specifications in the better known Pantone, CMYK, RGB, hex triplet and Avery systems.

<doc id="459132" wikidata="Q172517" url="?curid=459132" title="Flag of Jamaica">
<text>The flag of Jamaica was adopted on 6 August 1962, the day Jamaica became independent from British Empire. The flag consists of a gold saltire, which divides the flag into four sections: two of them green (top and bottom) and two black (hoist and fly). It is currently the only national flag that does not contain a shade of the colours red, white, or blue. Jamaica&#x27;s national flag is also sometimes referred to as &quot;The Cross&quot; or as the &quot;Black, Green, and Gold&quot; due to its form and colours.

==Design and symbolism==
Prior to Jamaica&#x27;s independence, the Jamaican government ran a flag design competition for Jamaica&#x27;s new flag. Over 360 designs were submitted, and several of these original submissions are housed in the National Library of Jamaica. However, the competition failed to yield a winner, and a bipartisan committee of the Jamaican House of Representatives eventually came up with the modern design. It was originally designed with horizontal stripes, but this was considered too similar to the flag of Tanganyika (as it was in 1962), and so the saltire was substituted. John McGhie claims the saltire design was directly inspired by the Flag of Scotland.

An earlier interpretation of the colours was, &quot;hardships there are but the land is green and the sun shineth&quot; as stated in the government Ministry Paper 28 – National Flag dated 22 May 1962. Gold recalls the shining sun, black reflects hardships, and green represents the land. It was changed in 1996 to black representing the strength and creativity of the people which has allowed them to overcome difficulties, gold for the wealth of the country and the golden sunshine, and green for the lush vegetation of the island, as well as hope. The change was made on the recommendation of the committee to Examine National Symbols and National Observances appointed by the then Prime Minister P. J. Patterson and chaired by Rex Nettleford. The flag is blazoned: &quot;Per saltire vert and sable, a saltire Or.&quot;

=== Construction details, sizes and colors ===
The flag has a length-to-width ratio of 1:2, which means that the length is twice as long as the breadth. The normal proportions are 1.5 meters by 3 meters (5 feet by 10 feet).

==Etiquette==
Standard etiquette applies in Jamaica to use of the national flag, primarily ensuring it is always the primary flag flown and is in good condition. The National Flag Code (a set of rules that owners of a flag should follow) was instituted by the government.
Jamaica&#x27;s state ensign is a Blue Ensign with the Jamaican national flag in the canton; it is normally only used by the Jamaican Government. Jamaica&#x27;s naval ensign follows the British system and is a White Ensign with a Saint George&#x27;s Cross and the Jamaican national flag in the canton, although due to the island&#x27;s lack of a navy, it is normally only used by the Jamaican Coast Guard.

<doc id="459142" wikidata="Q189612" url="?curid=459142" title="Flag of Jersey">
<text>The flag of Jersey is composed of a red saltire on a white field. In the upper quadrant the badge of Jersey surmounted by a yellow &quot;Plantagenet crown&quot;. The flag was adopted by the States of Jersey on 12 June 1979, proclaimed by Queen Elizabeth II on 10 December 1980 and first officially hoisted on 7 April 1981.

==Status and protocol==

The flag of Jersey has been decreed by the Sovereign for use in the Bailiwick of Jersey as the Island&#x27;s flag. The Union Flag may also be flown, but precedence should be given to the flag of Jersey. The Bailiff of Jersey requests the flying of the flag of Jersey on government buildings on a list of official flag days when flags are flown from the seat of the judiciary and legislature; individuals are encouraged, but not obliged, to observe official flag days also.

The pre-1981 flag of Jersey continues to be used as part of the re-enactment ceremonies of Liberation Day on 9 May.

== History==

The current flag is the first to be adopted officially. Unofficially, a plain red saltire had been used since at least the 1830s. The official flag adds the badge and crown to this.

===Plain saltire===
The origins of the association to Jersey of the red saltire are unknown.

A 1906 letter by the Bailiff of Jersey, describing the flag as &quot;the red St Andrew&#x27;s cross on white ground&quot;, states it was used to signal the neutrality of the Channel Islands during wars between England and France. A 1483 papal bull guaranteed the islands&#x27; neutrality during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The saltire may have been a variation of the St George&#x27;s Cross.

Links to the St Patrick&#x27;s Cross have been proposed. The St Patrick&#x27;s Cross is commonly identified with the arms of the FitzGeralds, a Cambro-Norman family which became powerful in Ireland, and who also owned land in Jersey. N. V. L. Rybot in 1951 suggested that Jersey&#x27;s flag originated from a mistake in a 1783 flag book by Carington Bowles, which was copied by later authors. Rybot&#x27;s theory is that Bowles misinterpreted (Dutch for &quot;Irish&quot;) as meaning &quot;Jersey&quot; in a Dutch flag-book he used as a source. However, French Admiralty charts show that Jersey was using the red saltire before 1783. In his &quot;History of Jersey&quot;, Balleine suggests that the saltire had in fact referred to Jersey, and that some had interpreted the flag to mean Ireland. At that date, Ireland would have been written , and the book contains a different entry for . The flag was attributed to in 1757 by French charts.

The use of the red saltire became more common during the German Occupation of World War II, as the local population were not allowed to display the Union Flag in occupied territory. Although the heraldic symbols of Jersey were used by the Island&#x27;s government during this time, all public buildings and landmarks (such as Fort Regent and Mont Orgueil) flew the Flag of Nazi Germany.

===Addition of the badge===
The move to a new flag was begun in 1977 with Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. It was felt by many in Jersey that the flag was insufficiently distinctive to represent the island, that there was too much confusion with the cross of St. Patrick as an Irish symbol, and that the red saltire had been taken as one of the international maritime signal flags.

Others, though, wanted to keep the traditional red saltire that had been used since time immemorial. A third influential body of opinion campaigned for the adoption of a banner of the three leopards (leopard being the heraldic term for a lion passant guardant), the island&#x27;s heraldic device. The current flag can, therefore, be seen as a compromise between the various strands of opinion. Although the flag is flown in Jersey, the three leopards are much more widely used as a national symbol by the authorities and civil population alike.

==Ensigns==

A civil ensign for use by Jersey registered merchant ships was approved in 2010, after a consultation process. The flag, which is the British Red Ensign with the badge and crown in the fly, was approved by Queen Elizabeth II, and subsequently by the States of Jersey in June 2010.

A government Blue Ensign, with the badge without the crown in the fly, was given a general warrant in 1997, having originally been issued in 1907 specifically for the government-owned tugboat &quot;Duke of Normandy&quot;.

<doc id="459147" wikidata="Q131650" url="?curid=459147" title="Flag of Kazakhstan">
<text>The flag of Kazakhstan was adopted on 4 June 1992, replacing the Soviet-era flag. The flag was designed by Shaken Niyazbekov.

==Description==

The national flag of the Republic of Kazakhstan has a gold sun with 32 rays above a soaring golden steppe eagle, both centered on a turquoise background; the hoist side displays a national ornamental pattern called &quot;koshkar-muiz&quot; (the horns of the ram) in gold; the blue colour is of religious significance to the Turkic peoples of the country, and so symbolises cultural and ethnic unity; it also represents the endless sky as well as water. The gold and blue colours also evoke the former Soviet flag, reusing the gold from the hammer and sickle, and the shade of blue from the turquoise bar at the bottom of that flag. The sun, a source of life and energy, exemplifies wealth and plenitude; the sun&#x27;s rays are shaped like grain, which is the basis of abundance and prosperity; the eagle has appeared on the flags of Kazakh tribes for centuries and represents freedom, power, and the flight to the future. The width of the flag to its length is 1:2.

== History ==
=== Central Asian Revolt ===
In 1916, Russia required Muslim people of central Asia to join Russian military forces. Russian colonial regime and economic instability lead to the Central Asian Revolt. Amongst Kazakhs, Amankeldı İmanov was leading figure in the revolts. He and his associated used red flag with the yellow text; blue half-moon in the top-left; blue bow, spear and an axe crossed on red background.

The text on the flag is in Arabic script, since Kazakh&#x27;s writing system was Arabic prior to 1929. The text on the flag says: &quot;Flag of warrior leader, Amangeldi batır&quot; (&quot;Batır&quot; (&quot;Батыр&quot;) means &quot;a hero&quot; in Kazakh).

=== Alash Autonomy ===

During World War I, Russia was exhausted as it was not ready for war. This was the reason for the food shortages, which occurred even in major cities like Petrograd. First revolution, started because of an economic instability led to the Russian ministers in charge of Central Asia to create the Alash party and found their own autonomy on territory of modern Kazakhstan.

Alash state again lacked one agreed flag, however the Autonomy had their proposed flags. Alikhan Bukeikhanov and Barlybek Syrtanov proposed the flag with green, yellow, red stripes and white crescent with yellow star in top-left in the draft constitution of the &quot;Country of the Kazakhs&quot; (1911), however, there is not a single historical confirmation of the use of this flag by the Alash Orda (1917–1920). The direction of stripes is not mentioned. Sometimes people use the logo of Kazak, the journal published by members of Alash, as a flag of the Autonomy. This variant of flag depicts a yellow yurt on a white background, this flag is mentioned in the &quot;Will of the People&quot; newspaper as approved on 6 June 1918.

=== Soviet Kazakhstan ===

After the victory of the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War, The Soviets consolidated Alash into the newly forming Kazakh Autonomy, resulting in the establishment of the Kazakh Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic in 1920. 
The first flag of the Kazakh ASSR consisted of two lines of yellow text in the canton, surrounded with a yellow line, reading &quot;KSSR&quot; (Kazakh SSR), and &quot;R.F.&quot; (Russian Federation).

Kazakhstan was a part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic until the 1937 establishment of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic within the Union, and, subsequently, changed its flag. This flag had the hammer and sickle in the canton and the name of the republic in Kazakh and Russian under it. The Kazakh name was written in Latin, as the writing system of Kazakh changed in 1929 from Arabic to Latin.

The final change of flag of the flag of the Kazakh SSR happened in 1953, when all the Soviet republics redesigned their flags. This flag consisted of a hammer and a sickle with a star above it and a light blue horizontal stripe on a red background. It remained in brief use after Kazakhstan gained its independence in December 1991.

=== Republic of Kazakhstan ===

Unlike other formerly Soviet nations, like Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus or Ukraine, Kazakhstan did not have an official flag before becoming part of the Soviet Union. Kazakhstan kept its Soviet flag up until 4 June 1992.

The Government of Kazakhstan organized a contest on 2 January 1992, which received several proposals. The designer of the current flag, Shaken Niyazbekov, had originally colored the ornament red. This was changed in July 1992 to the current shade of gold.

<doc id="459151" wikidata="Q165905" url="?curid=459151" title="Flag of Kenya">
<text>The flag of Kenya () is a tricolour of black, red, and green with two white edges imposed with a red, white and black Maasai shield and two crossed spears. The flag is mainly based on that of Kenya African National Union and was officially adopted on 12 December 1963 after Kenya&#x27;s independence.
==History==

In the years following World War II, the Kenya African Union was created and introduced a flag on September 3, 1951, which was a black and red bicolour with a shield and arrow at its centre. The next year it was altered into a black, red and the additional green tricolour with a shield crossed with a spear and arrow coupled with the initials &quot;KAU&quot; at its centre. The black stood for the native people, red for the common blood of all humanity and green for the nation&#x27;s fertile land. The weapons were a reminder for the organized struggle that was the basis for independence.In the 1952 book &quot;Mau Mau from Within,&quot; Kenyatta&#x27;s intentions were described differently: &quot;What he said must mean that our fertile lands (green) could only be regained by the blood (red) of the African (black). The black was separated from the green by the red: The African could only get to his land through blood.&quot; The flag was later adopted by the Kenya African National Union (KANU), successor to the KAU, in May 1960 with the weapons being replaced with a rooster wielding a battle axe. The Kenya Africa Democratic Union (KADU) was formed a month after adopted a flag following its formation in June 1960. Its flag was a tricolour of a similar design to that of KANU but with white instead of red in the middle.


Some officials wanted to use the KANU flag as the national flag. This was influenced by Tanganyika and Uganda&#x27;s choices to use the ruling party&#x27;s flag as the national flag. Tom Mboya, one of Kenya&#x27;s founding fathers, warned against using the KANU flag to avoid further politically polarizing the country. A committee set up by Jomo Kenyatta came up with a compromise that everyone could agree on. This was achieved by combining flags of the two rivaling parties, the KANU flag and that of KADU with the addition the white fimbriations (which were originally to symbolize Kenya&#x27;s multiracial society as they did in KADU&#x27;s flag but were changed to symbolize peace and unity), a modified Maasai shield crossed with spears, reminiscent to the original KAU flag, were also added. The colours of the flag and their symbolism were inspired by and match closely to those of the Pan-African flag adopted by the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League in 1920.The 2010 revised edition of the Constitution of Kenya includes specifications of the Kenyan flag, located in the Second Schedule, Article 9, paragraph 6.2.

==Symbolism==

The Kenyan flag includes symbols of unity, peace, and defence of the country. The color black represents the African continent, red represents the bloodshed during the fight for independence from the British colonialism, and green represents the country&#x27;s landscape and natural wealth. The white fimbriation was added later to symbolise peace, honesty, purity, and innocence. The black, red, and white traditional African shield and two spears symbolise the defence of all the things mentioned above. Many of both colours and symbolic values are shared with the flag of South Sudan.

==Design==

The colours of the flag are specified in the Constitution in terms of British Standard 2660.

<doc id="459155" wikidata="Q165545" url="?curid=459155" title="Flag of Kuwait">
<text>The flag of Kuwait () was adopted on 7 September 1961, and officially hoisted 24 November 1961. Before 1961, the flag of Kuwait was red and white, like those of other Arab states of the Persian Gulf at the time, with the field being red and words or charges being written in white. It is the only flag in the world featuring an acute trapezium. 

When the Utub settled in Kuwait, Kuwaiti ships were flying a flag common on the western coast of the Persian Gulf, a red flag added to it near the mast a serrated white ribbon similar to the current Bahrain flag and was called in the name of the Sulaimi flag. This flag was raised in the rule of Sheikh Sabah I bin Jaber in 1752 to 1871. 

During the period of Ottoman rule in Kuwait, the Ottoman flag, red with a white crescent and star, was used. This flag was retained after the country became a British protectorate in the Anglo-Kuwaiti Agreement of 1899. 

In 1903, Lord Curzon, the British Viceroy and Governor-General of India visited Kuwait, and Sheikh Mubarak Al-Sabah received him and raised a red flag with white words, توكلنا على الله (&quot;We trust in God&quot;) in Arabic writing. This avoided the diplomatic faux pas, given Kuwait was under British protection, of raising the Ottoman flag. 

Two different flag designs were proposed but not adopted in the period after this. The first proposal in 1906, a red flag with white Western letters spelling (&quot;KOWEIT&quot;) and the second in 1913, the Ottoman flag but the word كويت (&quot;Kuwayt&quot;) in Arabic writing as a canton.

The Ottoman flag kept being used until the First World War, when friendly-fire incidents with the British in 1914 during the Mesopotamian campaign around the river Shatt al-Arab occurred due to Kuwait and the enemy Ottomans both using the same flag. Because of this Kuwait adopted a new flag, red with كويت (&quot;Kuwait&quot;) in Arabic writing. This flag was in use until 1921, when Sheikh Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah added the Shahada to the flag. This version was in use until 1940, when he also added a stylized falcon&#x27;s claw to the flag. These flags were also depicted on the Emblems of Kuwait. The red flag remained the national flag of Kuwait until the adoption of the current one in September 1961. The present flag is in the Pan-Arab colours, but each colour is also significant in its own right.

The colours&#x27; meaning came from a poem by Safie Al-Deen Al-Hali:
*White are our deeds
*Black are our battles
*Green are our lands
*Red are our swords
Rules of hanging and flying the flag:
*Horizontally: The green stripe should be on top.
*Vertically: The red stripe should be on the left side of the flag.
In 2005, it became the design of the world&#x27;s largest kite at a size of 1019 square metres. It was made in New Zealand by Peter Lynn, launched to the public for the first time in 2004 in the United Kingdom, officially launched in Kuwait in 2005, and has not been surpassed since.

The flag can also appear to resemble the corner of a room, with the green and red being the ceiling and floor, and mismatched black and white walls.

<doc id="459160" wikidata="Q46008" url="?curid=459160" title="Flag of Laos">
<text>The flag of Laos ( &quot;thungsad Lāo&quot;) consists of three horizontal stripes, with the middle stripe in blue being twice the height of the top and bottom red stripes. In the middle is a white disc, the diameter of the disc is the height of the blue stripe. The flag ratio is 2:3.

The flag was first adopted in 1945 under the short-lived Lao Issara government of 1945–46, then by the Pathet Lao. It is one of the two flags of a country currently governed by a communist party (the other being Cuba) that currently does not use any communist symbolism. The current flag was adopted on December 2, 1975, when it became a socialist state. The royal flag before 1975 remains in use by a number of Laotian diaspora.

==Overview==
This current flag replaced the red flag, with the triple-headed white elephant Airavata on a pedestal beneath a parasol, which had been the flag of the 19th century Kingdom of Luang Phrabang. The flag had continued to be used when this kingdom became a French protectorate, and following its unification with the other provinces of Laos into the Kingdom of Laos, which became independent in 1953. The flag expressed the ancient name of the country, &quot;Land of a Million Elephants&quot;. From 1953 onward the royal government waged war with the Pathet Lao, whose flag was blue with a white disk and red borders at the top and bottom.

From 1973 to 1975, the Pathet Lao formed part of the government coalition, before assuming power directly and prompting the abdication of the king. Their flag was adopted as the national flag. According to the original creator of the current Lao flag, Maha Sila Viravong, the white disk in the center symbolizes the unity of the Lao people (and the future reunification of the two Laotian regions of Laos and Northeastern Thailand that are divided by the Mekong River) under one nation. It is also said to represent a full moon against the Mekong River. The red stripes stand for the blood shed by the Lao people on both banks of the Mekong River (the multi-ethnic people of Laos and the Isan people of Northeastern Thailand) in their struggle for freedom and independence from the French, and the blue symbolizes the Mekong River itself, a symbol of the nation&#x27;s prosperity.

==History==

The current Lao flag was designed in 1945 by Maha Sila Viravong, a famous Lao nationalist, intellectual, and scholar of traditional Lao literature, history, and culture. As a member of the Lao Issara movement, he was tasked with creating a new Lao national flag that was to be distinct from the royalist red flag with the white three-headed elephant, representing the Japanese puppet state of Luang Prabang. Viravong drew inspiration from Thailand&#x27;s 1917 adoption of a red-white-blue tricolour, replacing the traditional royal flag (also a red flag with a white elephant). After the establishment of the Lao Issara government and the adoption of the first Lao constitution on October 12, 1945, Viravong&#x27;s flag was selected by the new government as its national flag, lasting until the reassertion of French control in 1946. The Lao Issara, as a political movement, continued to use the flag in exile until its dissolution in 1949. Its communist-led successor, the Pathet Lao, chose Viravong&#x27;s flag to represent their movement until the fall of the royal government in 1975, when the Pathet Lao took power and adopted it as the national flag.

From 1952 until the fall of the royal government in 1975, the country had a red flag, with a white three-headed elephant (representing the Hindu god Erawan) in the middle. On top of the elephant is a nine-folded umbrella, while the elephant itself stands on a five-level pedestal. The white elephant is a common royal symbol in Southeast Asia, especially in Myanmar, Thailand and Laos. This flag was adopted by the royal monarchy of Luang Prabang since the beginning of the 20th century under French rule, inspired by its similar flag (red flag with the single white elephant) in Thailand during that time.

The nine-folded umbrella is also a royal symbol, originating from Mount Meru in Buddhist cosmology. The pedestal represented the law on which the country rested.

Currently, the flag, similar to the flag of South Vietnam, remains in use by the Royal Lao Government in Exile and various Laotian opposition groups who opposed communist rule in Laos. In 2015, the city of Smithfield, Rhode Island passed a resolution to adopt the royalist flag as its &quot;Heritage and Freedom&quot; flag.
