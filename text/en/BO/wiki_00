<text>Army of Lovers is a Swedish dance-pop group which formed in 1987 and had a number of hits in Europe throughout the 1990s. Some of their biggest successes include the song &quot;Crucified&quot;, which was a big hit in Europe, charting 31 weeks in the Eurochart and peaking at number 14 in 1992. It remains their best-known song internationally. Their second international hit, &quot;Obsession&quot;, charted 32 weeks and peaked at number 29.

The name of the band alludes to the documentary film &quot;Army of Lovers or Revolt of the Perverts&quot; by German gay rights activist Rosa von Praunheim, the title of which in turn alludes to the Sacred Band of Thebes.

==History==
===Overview===
The founding members, who had all worked together in a band called Barbie, were Alexander Bard, Jean-Pierre Barda, and Camilla Henemark (aka La Camilla).

Army of Lovers had many top 10 hits on the Eurochart, the biggest being &quot;Crucified&quot;, which was one of the biggest-selling European singles of 1991. Their total album sales were seven million copies worldwide.

The band became famous for their outlandish visual appearance (many of their costumes were created by Camilla Thulin), and their high camp music videos directed by Fredrik Boklund.

While Alexander Bard was the brain behind the band, Jean-Pierre Barda was the lead vocalist on hits such as &quot;Crucified&quot; and &quot;Israelism&quot;. Bard and Barda were the only two band members who were present throughout all of the band&#x27;s various line-ups. When La Camilla left in 1991, she was replaced by Michaela de la Cour. In 1992, Dominika Peczynski joined, making the band a four-piece. In 1995, De la Cour left and Henemark returned.

===Early success and breakup: 1987–1996===
Although both &quot;Obsession&quot; and &quot;Ride the Bullet&quot; reached the top spot of the European charts, the group&#x27;s presence in the US and the UK was limited to club chart successes (though &quot;Crucified&quot; reached the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1992).

While they focused on experimenting with various club sounds and samples on their first album, &quot;Disco Extravaganza&quot; (later re-issued as &quot;Army of Lovers&quot; in the US), the artists released a proper pop/dance album with &quot;Massive Luxury Overdose&quot;. The record spawned their biggest hits (&quot;Crucified&quot;, &quot;Ride the Bullet&quot;, and &quot;Obsession&quot;) and managed to sell 250,000 copies in Germany alone. &quot;Massive Luxury Overdose&quot; was later re-issued for the US market, featuring a new cover and four brand new tracks. Their third album, &quot;The Gods of Earth and Heaven&quot;, was never released in the US. The first single from the album, &quot;Israelism&quot;, received radio airplay in several European countries and topped the charts in Israel despite being subject to criticism. Their fourth album, &quot;Glory, Glamour and Gold&quot; (1994), was supported by a club tour across Germany, where the band promoted same-sex marriage. In 1995, Army of Lovers released their first best-of compilation entitled &quot;Les Greatest Hits&quot;, which included three new songs. One year later, it was re-released with one additional new song called &quot;King Midas&quot;, which replaced &quot;Stand up for Myself&quot;. It was written by Jonas Berggren from Ace of Base.

By this point, they had released four studio albums, made over twenty music videos, and become successful across Eastern Europe before Bard disbanded the group to concentrate on his new group Vacuum in 1996.

===Reunion: 2001–2009===
Army of Lovers reformed briefly in 2001 to celebrate the 10th anniversary since their breakthrough with the release of another best-of compilation called &quot;Le Grand Docu-Soap&quot;. The compilation contained three covers, including &quot;Let the Sunshine In&quot; and &quot;Hands Up&quot;.

===Further reunions, releases, and shows: 2011–present===
Two members of Army of Lovers (La Camilla and Dominika) reunited in June 2011 and appeared as guest vocalists on &quot;Don&#x27;t Try to Steal My Limelight&quot;, a single by Swedish drag artist and blogger Miss Inga. The three later formed the band Happy Hoes and released &quot;We Rule the World&quot;, followed by a Christmas song entitled &quot;Happy Ho Ho Ho&quot;. Happy Hoes performed at Pride 2012. Army of Lovers reformed with Alexander Bard, Camilla Henemark, and Jean-Pierre Barda in late 2012 to enter the Melodifestivalen 2013 with the song &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Ride&quot;, in hopes of representing Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malmö. Their entry did not reach the finals of the Melodifestivalen. Just a few days after their performance, Bard explained to the press that Camilla Henemark had been kicked out once again and that Dominika Peczynski had returned. This was followed by a public fight between Bard and Peczynski against Henemark.

A new best-of compilation, with four new songs, called &quot;Big Battle of Egos&quot;, was announced for release on 27 March 2013, to be followed by a single and video called &quot;Signed on My Tattoo&quot;, a duet between Army of Lovers and Alexander Bard with his other pop group Gravitonas.

In June 2013, an EP called &quot;Scandinavian Crime&quot; was released, which included re-recorded versions of &quot;Rockin&#x27; The Ride&quot; and &quot;Tragedy&quot;, originally from their CD &quot;Big Battle of Egos&quot;. These new versions featured new vocals by Dominika Peczynski and Jean-Pierre Barda, replacing the parts originally sung by Camilla Henemark. On 1 July 2013, the video for &quot;Crucified 2013&quot; premiered on Expressen TV. The song was a revamped version of the band&#x27;s breakthrough hit from 1991 and was chosen as the official anthem for Copenhagen Pride 2013.

In November 2023, the band released the album &quot;Sexodus&quot;.

<text>In sociolinguistics, an abstand language is a language variety or cluster of varieties with significant linguistic distance from all others, while an ausbau language is a standard variety, possibly with related dependent varieties. Heinz Kloss introduced these terms in 1952 to denote two separate and largely independent sets of criteria for recognizing a &quot;language&quot;:

* one based on linguistic properties compared to related varieties (, , &quot;distance&quot;)
* the other based on sociopolitical functions (, , &quot;expansion&quot;)

This framework addresses situations in which multiple varieties from a dialect continuum have been standardized, so that they are commonly considered distinct languages even though they may be mutually intelligible. The continental Scandinavian languages offer a commonly cited example of this situation. One of the applications of this theoretical framework is language standardization (examples since the 1960s including Basque and Romansh).

== Abstand languages ==

&quot;Abstandsprache&quot; means &quot;language by virtue of linguistic distance&quot;. Kloss suggested the English translation &quot;language by distance&quot;, referring to linguistic differences rather than geographical separation. &quot;Abstand&quot; means a distance of ongoing separation, e.g. a clearance by mechanical design. In the context of language varieties, &quot;abstand&quot; indicates the discontinuity of two dialects; in the words of Kloss, there is a &quot;definite break&quot; between the varieties.

An &quot;abstand&quot; language is a cluster of varieties that is distinctly separate from any other language. European examples include Basque and Breton. Kloss also spoke of degrees of &quot;abstand&quot; between pairs of varieties. He did not specify how the differences between two varieties would be measured, assuming that linguists would apply objective criteria. A standard linguistic criterion is mutual intelligibility, though this does not always produce consistent results, for example when applied to a dialect continuum.

An &quot;abstand&quot; language does not need to have a standard form. This is often the case with minority languages used within a larger state, where the minority language is used only in private, and all official functions are performed in the majority language.

== Ausbau languages ==

The German verb &quot;ausbauen&quot; (, literally &quot;to build out&quot;) expresses core meanings of &quot;expanding&quot; something or &quot;developing something to completion&quot;, e.g. adding to an existing structure. (Croatian linguist translated &quot;Ausbausprache&quot; into French as &quot;langue par élaboration&quot;.) Kloss suggested the English translation &quot;language by development&quot;, referring to the development of a standard variety from part of a dialect continuum:

Languages belonging in this category are recognized as such because of having been shaped or reshaped, molded or remolded—as the case may be—in order to become a standardized tool of literary expression.

Kloss identified several stages of this development, beginning with use of the variety for humour or folklore, followed by lyrics and then narrative prose. The next phase, which he considered crucial, was use of the variety for serious non-fiction. From this point, the variety could be further developed for use in technical, scientific or government domains.

A standard variety developed in this way can be mutually intelligible with other standard varieties. A commonly cited example occurs in the Scandinavian dialect continuum spanning Norway, Sweden and Denmark. The three standardized languages Norwegian, Swedish and Danish (or four if Norwegian &quot;Bokmål&quot; and &quot;Nynorsk&quot; are distinguished) are mutually distinct &quot;ausbau&quot; languages, even though speakers of the different standards can readily understand one another.

This classification invokes the criterion of social and political functions of language use. The sociolinguist Peter Trudgill has linked Kloss&#x27;s theoretical framework with Einar Haugen&#x27;s framework of autonomy and heteronomy, with the statement that a variety is an &quot;ausbau&quot; language corresponding to the statement that it is used &quot;autonomously&quot; with respect to other related languages. Such a language has an independent cultural status, even though it may be mutually intelligible with other &quot;ausbau&quot; languages from the same continuum. This typically means that it has its own standardized form independent of neighbouring standard languages, it is typically taught in schools, and it is used as a written language in a wide variety of social and political functions, possibly including that of an official national language. In contrast, varieties that are not &quot;ausbau&quot; languages are typically only spoken and typically only used in private contexts. Trudgill expands the definition to include related varieties:

[A]n Ausbau language is an autonomous standardized variety together with all the nonstandard dialects from that part of the dialect continuum which are heteronomous with respect to it i.e. dependent on it.
== Roofing ==
Kloss described an &quot;ausbau&quot; language as providing a &quot;roof&quot; (German: &quot;Dach&quot;) over dependent varieties, whereas non-standard varieties without a reference standard were &quot;roofless dialects&quot;. He used the term &quot;near-dialectized sister languages&quot; for varieties roofed by a standard variety with which they are related but not mutually intelligible, such as Low Saxon (roofed by Standard German), Occitan and Haitian Creole (roofed by French), and Sardinian (roofed by Italian).

Muljačić introduced the term &quot;Dachsprache&quot;, or &quot;roofing language&quot;, for a dialect that serves as a standard language for other dialects. These dialects would usually be in a dialect continuum, but may be so different that mutual intelligibility is not possible between all dialects, particularly those separated by significant geographical distance. In 1982, &quot;Rumantsch Grischun&quot; was developed by Heinrich Schmid as such a &quot;Dachsprache&quot; for a number of quite different Romansh language forms spoken in parts of Switzerland. Similarly, Standard Basque and the Southern Quechua literary standard were both developed as standard languages for dialect continua that had historically been thought of as discrete languages with many dialects and no &quot;official&quot; dialect. Standard German and Italian, to some extent, function in the same way. Perhaps the most widely used &quot;Dachsprache&quot; is Modern Standard Arabic, which links together the speakers of many different, often mutually unintelligible varieties of Arabic.

== Distance between ausbau languages ==
Kloss recognized three degrees of separation between ausbau languages.

When two standards are based on identical or near-identical dialects, he considered them as splits of the same standard into two or more, constituting a pluricentric language. Examples include British and American Standard English, Standard Austrian German and German Standard German, or European and Brazilian variants of Portuguese. High Hindi and Urdu also have a common dialect basis (Dehlavi). The same is the case with Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrin, which also have the same dialect basis (Shtokavian), and consequently constitute four standard variants of the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian language. 

Standards created from different dialects, but with little &quot;abstand&quot;, would not be considered separate abstand languages, but constitute distinct ausbau languages, as noted above for Danish, Swedish and Norwegian. The concept of &quot;ausbau&quot; is particularly important in cases where the local spoken varieties across a larger region form a dialect continuum. In such cases, the question of where the one language ends and the other starts is often a question more of &quot;ausbau&quot; than of &quot;abstand.&quot; In some instances, &quot;ausbau&quot; languages have been created out of dialects for purposes of nation-building. This applies, for instance, to Luxembourgish &quot;vis-a-vis&quot; German (the vernaculars in Luxembourg are varieties of Moselle Franconian, which is also spoken in the German sections of the Moselle River valley and neighbouring French département of Moselle). Other examples of groups of vernaculars lacking &quot;abstand&quot; internally but that have given rise to multiple &quot;ausbau&quot; languages are: Persian of Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan (&quot;cf.&quot; Farsi, Dari,Tajik); Bulgarian and Macedonian, because they have different dialect bases.

Finally, the &quot;ausbau&quot; languages may be so different that they also constitute &quot;abstand&quot; languages. Examples include Dutch versus German, Persian versus Pashto, and Tamil versus Telugu.

In the former two cases, scholars do not always agree on the best classification, as they always partake, inadvertently, in the &quot;language making&quot; and &quot;language unmaking&quot; process. The concept of a One Standard German Axiom in that language is a case in point that illustrates the contested nature of the first two types of ausbau languages and occasionally also the third, varying with the degree with which sociolinguistic processes are assigned relevance in a particular approach.

== Change of roles over time ==
There are several instances of languages and language pairs that have undergone role changes over time. Low German, for instance, was both an Abstand language and a roof of local dialects in the Netherlands and Germany and in parts of the Baltic states and their formerly German vicinity. With the end of the Hanseatic League, Low German lost its status as an official language to a large degree. Approximately at the same time, Dutch started to replace Low German as a roof of the Low German dialects in the Netherlands that form today&#x27;s Dutch Low Saxon group, and most Central German dialects went under the &quot;roof&quot; of the evolving High German. Low German ceased to be spoken on the eastern rim of the Baltic Sea. Today, its dialects surviving in northern Germany have come under the roof of Standard German. Local Low German dialects spoken in the Netherlands have come under the roof of Dutch. This happened despite the effect of notable migration streams in both directions between the Western (Dutch) and Eastern (Prussian, now mainly Polish and Russian) areas of the region of the Low German languages, motivated by both religious intolerance and labour need. In several spots along the Dutch–German border, identical dialects are spoken on both sides, but are deemed to belong to different roofing according to which side of the border they are on.

<text>William Eldon O&#x27;Ree (born October 15, 1935) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player from Fredericton, New Brunswick. He is widely recognized for being the first black player in the National Hockey League (NHL), playing as a winger for the Boston Bruins. His accomplishment of breaking the colour barrier in the NHL has led him to sometimes be referred to as the &quot;Jackie Robinson of hockey,&quot; whom he had the chance to meet when he was younger. In 2018, O&#x27;Ree was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, and starting that year the NHL has introduced the annual Willie O&#x27;Ree Community Hero Award in his honor.

==Early life and career==
William Eldon O&#x27;Ree was born on October 15, 1935, in Fredericton, New Brunswick, to Harry, a civil engineer and road maintenance worker, and Rosebud O&#x27;Ree. He was the youngest of nine siblings. His grandparents were escapees of slavery in the United States, moving to Canada through the Underground Railroad. Fredericton had a small black population during O&#x27;Ree&#x27;s early years, with only two families living in the city at the time.

O&#x27;Ree began skating at the age of three and started playing organized hockey at the age of five. O&#x27;Ree regularly used the family&#x27;s backyard rink to play the game, and when the weather allowed, he would skate to school. In the early rinks, skin colour was never a problem, as O&#x27;Ree wrote in his autobiography, &quot;The Willie O’Ree Story: Hockey’s Black Pioneer&quot;.

When O&#x27;Ree was 14 years old, he was taught how to bodycheck by his older brother Richard, with whom he played organized hockey. O&#x27;Ree also played baseball during this time for Fredericton&#x27;s West Enders team, where in October 1950 he received an outstanding player trophy. O&#x27;Ree was predicted by &quot;The Daily Gleaner&quot; sportswriter Jack Riley to have the potential to become &quot;another Don Newcombe, Sam Jethroe, or Jackie Robinson&quot; in the future. At this age, O&#x27;Ree also met Robinson. At the age of 15, O&#x27;Ree participated in the New Brunswick Amateur Hockey Association playoffs as a part of the Fredericton Falcons. He later played for the Fredericton Capitals and attended Fredericton High School, but was deemed potentially ineligible to play hockey for the school because of a New Brunswick Interscholastic Athletic Association (NBIAA) rule forbidding players who already have a history playing intermediate or senior sports from playing on the interscholastic level.

==Playing career==
O&#x27;Ree first began playing hockey out-of-province after being signed to the Quebec Frontenacs of the Quebec Junior Hockey League in September 1954. O&#x27;Ree played junior hockey for several teams in Quebec and Ontario before being signed by the Quebec Aces of the Quebec Hockey League (QHL) in 1955. Midway through his second minor-league season with the Quebec Aces, O&#x27;Ree was called up to the Boston Bruins of the NHL to replace Leo Labine, who was unable to play due to an illness. Two years earlier, O&#x27;Ree had been blinded when he was hit in his right eye by an errant puck; which would have precluded him from playing in the NHL if the Bruins had known. However, O&#x27;Ree managed to keep it secret, and made his NHL debut with the Bruins on January 18, 1958, against the Montreal Canadiens, becoming the first black player in league history. He played two games that year, with centre man Don McKenney and right wing Jerry Toppazzini as his linemates. O&#x27;Ree played 43 games for the Bruins during the 1960–61 NHL season. An incident occurred during a game from that season against the Chicago Blackhawks in Chicago Stadium. According to O&#x27;Ree, he was called racist names by several of the Blackhawks players. During the game, Eric Nesterenko butt-ended O&#x27;Ree, knocking out his two front teeth and breaking his nose. O&#x27;Ree responded by hitting Nesterenko over the head with his stick, which O&#x27;Ree said &quot;almost created a riot.&quot; O&#x27;Ree remembered that fans called him racist names and that the Blackhawks players were threatening to kill him, and he stated that he was &quot;lucky to get out of the arena alive.&quot; After the 1960-61 season, O&#x27;Ree was traded to the Montreal Canadiens. O&#x27;Ree described that the Canadiens were run by racists and that he wasn&#x27;t invited to try out for the team, but was sent to a minor league team in Hull, Quebec. O&#x27;Ree scored 4 goals and 10 assists in his NHL career, all in 1961.

O&#x27;Ree faced racial taunts throughout his hockey career, including in the NHL, especially in the United States. 

He noted that racist remarks were much worse in the U.S. cities than in Toronto and Montreal, the two Canadian cities hosting NHL teams at the time, and that &quot;Fans would yell, &#x27;Go back to the South&#x27; and &#x27;How come you&#x27;re not picking cotton?&#x27; Things like that. It didn&#x27;t bother me. I just wanted to be a hockey player, and if they couldn&#x27;t accept that fact, then that was their problem, not mine.&quot;

In the minor leagues, O&#x27;Ree won two scoring titles in the Western Hockey League (WHL) between 1961 and 1974, scoring 30 or more goals 4 times, with a high of 38 in 1964–65 and 1968–69. O&#x27;Ree played 50 games for the American Hockey League&#x27;s New Haven Nighthawks in 1972–73. Most of O&#x27;Ree&#x27;s playing time was with the WHL&#x27;s Los Angeles Blades and San Diego Gulls. The latter team retired his number, which now hangs from the rafters at Pechanga Arena, formerly known as the San Diego Sports Arena. O&#x27;Ree continued to play in the minors until the age of 43.

==Impact on hockey==
After O&#x27;Ree&#x27;s stint in the NHL, there were no other black players in the NHL until another Canadian player, Mike Marson, was drafted by the Washington Capitals in 1974. There were 23 black players in the NHL as of the mid-2010s. Art Dorrington was the first black player to sign an NHL contract, in 1950 with the New York Rangers organisation, but never played beyond the minor league level. NHL players are now required to enroll in a preseason diversity training seminar, and racially based verbal abuse is punished through suspensions and fines. O&#x27;Ree is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Jackie Robinson of hockey&quot; for breaking the color barrier in hockey.

Since 1998, O&#x27;Ree has been the NHL&#x27;s Diversity Ambassador, traveling across North America to schools and hockey programs to promote messages of inclusion, dedication, and confidence.

Starting in the 2017–18 season, the NHL has instituted the annual Willie O&#x27;Ree Community Hero Award to recognize &quot;an individual who - through the game of hockey - has positively impacted his or her community, culture or society&quot;. It is awarded through public voting.

==Accomplishments==
O&#x27;Ree was inducted into the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame in March 1984. In 1998, O&#x27;Ree was working at the Hotel del Coronado near San Diego, California, when the National Hockey League approached him to be the director of youth development for its diversity task force. The NHL/USA Hockey Diversity Task Force is a non-profit program for minority youth that encourages them to learn and play hockey. As of the mid-2000s, O&#x27;Ree lives in Berkeley, California. O&#x27;Ree and Kevin Weekes appeared in the &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot; episode &quot;Everybody Hates Gretzky&quot; in 2008.

On the afternoon of January 19, 2008, the Bruins and NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly honoured O&#x27;Ree at TD Garden in Boston to mark the 50th anniversary of his NHL debut. In addition, The Sports Museum of New England located in the TD Garden, established a special exhibit on O&#x27;Ree&#x27;s career, comprising many items on loan from his collection. Those in attendance included a busload of friends from O&#x27;Ree&#x27;s hometown of Fredericton. Two days earlier, the City of Fredericton honoured him by naming a new sports complex on the North side after him. Around the time of the 60th anniversary of O&#x27;Ree&#x27;s contribution to ice hockey in early 2008, he was once again honoured by the Bruins and the NHL, with a new street hockey rink in Boston named in his honour, one of many accolades with which the Bruins and NHL legend are involved. On January 27, 2008, the NHL also honoured O&#x27;Ree during the 56th National Hockey League All-Star Game in Atlanta, Georgia. On February 5, 2008, ESPN did a special on him in honour of Black History Month. On October 29, 2008, San Diego State University presented O&#x27;Ree with an Award for Outstanding Commitment to Diversity and Cross Cultural Understanding. In 2008, O&#x27;Ree was also inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honouring San Diego&#x27;s finest athletes both on and off the playing surface.

The same year, O&#x27;Ree received the Order of Canada, the highest civilian award for a Canadian citizen. He was honoured as a pioneer of hockey and a dedicated youth mentor in Canada along with the U.S. On June 28, 2011, The Sports Museum at TD Garden in Boston honoured O&#x27;Ree with the Hockey Legacy Award at the 10th Annual &quot;The Tradition.&quot; Other honourees that evening included Larry Bird, Mike Lowell, and Ty Law. The Buffalo Sabres hosted a Willie O&#x27;Ree skills weekend in March 2012. His jersey was retired by the San Diego Gulls on October 16, 2015.

As the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals were about to start, the San Jose Sharks&#x27; Barbadian Canadian star right winger Joel Ward was preparing to play against the Pittsburgh Penguins, and told ESPN that O&#x27;Ree was one of his inspirations to play pro hockey, and should have his player number 22 retired by the NHL league-wide, just as Jackie Robinson, the first player of color in Major League Baseball has been honoured. Ward himself honoured Robinson&#x27;s legacy through his last season in NHL play by wearing jersey number 42 in NHL play; Robinson&#x27;s player number 42 has been retired league-wide in pro baseball.

On November 3, 2017, O&#x27;Ree was honoured with a banner by the Springfield Thunderbirds during a pregame ceremony to commemorate his time with the Springfield Indians.

A more personal honour for O&#x27;Ree was arranged by John Grzelcyk, father of former Bruins defenseman Matt Grzelcyk. A long-time member of the Boston Garden and TD Garden &quot;bull-gang&quot; team of arena personnel that assists with &quot;changeovers&quot; for different events at each facility, the senior Grzelcyk had saved an original number 22 Bruins uniform jersey worn by O&#x27;Ree from the 1960–61 Boston Bruins season, when O&#x27;Ree last played in the NHL as a Bruin. Both Grzelcyks personally presented the jersey to O&#x27;Ree, to honour him for his time with the Bruins and the NHL. At about the same time as O&#x27;Ree received his vintage Bruins game-sweater, it became known that Madison Bowey, a then-Washington Capitals rookie of bi-racial ethnicity, had been taught by his Black Canadian father about O&#x27;Ree&#x27;s importance in NHL history, and selected 22 as his number with the Capitals to honour O&#x27;Ree&#x27;s achievement.

On June 26, 2018, it was announced that O&#x27;Ree would be inducted as a builder into the Hockey Hall of Fame later that year.

Almost ten months after receiving his original Bruins sweater from the Grzelcyks, on November 1, 2018, O&#x27;Ree attended the ceremonial dedication of a street hockey rink named in his honour in the Boston neighbourhood of Allston, as part of the continuing legacy of O&#x27;Ree&#x27;s time with the Bruins.

By early May 2019, following O&#x27;Ree&#x27;s builder honour with the Hockey Hall of Fame the previous year, a bill in the 116th U.S. Congress is authorising the award of the United States Congressional Gold Medal for O&#x27;Ree&#x27;s achievements &quot;in recognition of his contributions and commitment to hockey, inclusion, and recreational opportunity.&quot;

O&#x27;Ree was named to Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame on May 27, 2020, in the Builder category. The formal induction ceremony was postponed to October 3, 2021, due to concerns over COVID-19.

On January 12, 2021, the Boston Bruins announced that they would retire O&#x27;Ree&#x27;s number 22 on February 18. However, the jersey retirement ceremony was moved to January 18, 2022, by the NHL.

In 2021, as a celebration of Black History Month, all NHL players wore a commemorative helmet decal honouring O&#x27;Ree from January 16 to February 28.

In 2022, US President Joe Biden signed the Willie O&#x27;Ree Congressional Gold Medal Act. The bill awarded O&#x27;Ree a Congressional Gold Medal, the U.S. Congress&#x27; highest honour, for his contributions to &quot;hockey, inclusion and recreational opportunity.&quot; O&#x27;Ree is the first player in NHL history to receive the honour.

Canada Post released a commemorative postage stamp on October 30, 2023, honouring Willie O&#x27;Ree.

<doc id="446076" wikidata="Q37453" url="?curid=446076" title="Prunus armeniaca">
<text>Prunus armeniaca is the most commonly cultivated apricot species. The native range is somewhat uncertain due to its extensive prehistoric cultivation. Genetic studies indicate Central Asia is the center of origin. It is extensively cultivated in many countries and has escaped into the wild in many places.

The specific epithet &quot;armeniaca&quot; refers to the country of Armenia in Western Asia.

== Description ==
&quot;Prunus armeniaca&quot; is a small tree, tall, with a trunk up to in diameter and a dense, spreading canopy. The leaves are ovate, long and wide, with a rounded base, a pointed tip and a finely serrated margin. The flowers are in diameter, with five white to pinkish petals; they are produced singly or in pairs in early spring before the leaves. The fruit is a drupe similar to a small peach, diameter (larger in some modern cultivars), from yellow to orange, often tinged red on the side most exposed to the sun; its surface can be smooth (botanically described as: ) or velvety with very short hairs (botanically: ). The flesh (mesocarp) is succulent and its taste can range from sweet to tart. The single seed is enclosed in a hard, stony shell, often called a &quot;stone&quot;, with a grainy, smooth texture except for three ridges running down one side.

== Varieties ==
According to the Catalogue of Life and Flora of China, there are six varieties of &quot;P. armeniaca&quot;:
* &quot;Prunus armeniaca&quot; var. &quot;ansu&quot; – ansu apricot (, &quot;anzu&quot;), pink-flowered, East Asia
* &quot;Prunus armeniaca&quot; var. &quot;armeniaca&quot; – common apricot, Central Asia and China, widely cultivated
* &quot;Prunus armeniaca&quot; var. &quot;holosericea&quot; – Tibetan apricot, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Tibet
* &quot;Prunus armeniaca&quot; var. &quot;meixianensis&quot; – Mei County apricot, double-flowered, Shaanxi
* &quot;Prunus armeniaca&quot; var. &quot;xiongyueensis&quot; – Xiongyue apricot, Liaoning
* &quot;Prunus armeniaca&quot; var. &quot;zhidanensis&quot; – Zhidan apricot, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Shanxi

== Cultivation and uses ==

=== Origin, domestication and diffusion ===

According to the Soviet botanist Nikolai Vavilov, the center of origin of &quot;P. armeniaca&quot; is Central Asia, where its domestication would have taken place, and China is another center of domestication. His hypothesis has been confirmed by genetic studies.

There were at least three independent domestication events in the demographic history of &quot;P. armeniaca&quot;:
* The one from the wild populations in southern Central Asia (Kyrgyzstan) gave rise to the cultivated apricot in southern Central Asia and northern South Asia.
* The one from the wild populations in northern Central Asia (Kazakhstan) gave rise to the cultivated apricot in northern Central Asia, West Asia (including Armenia), Europe and North Africa.
* The third one occurred in China and gave rise to cultivated apricot in East Asia. It involved the wild populations from northern Central Asia, and the kernel-using varieties have introgression from &quot;P. sibirica&quot;.

The cultivated apricot diffused westward by two main routes: one is Central Asia → West Asia → Mediterranean Europe &amp; North Africa, and the other is Central Asia → continental Europe. In addition, the cultivated apricot from Japan had a minor contribution to that in Mediterranean Europe.

=== History of cultivation ===

==== Eastern Eurasia ====
The earliest archaeological evidence for apricots comes from Kuahuqao (6,000–5,400 BCE) in East China. Beginning in about the seventh century, apricots in China have been preserved by various methods, including salting and smoking, and the more common drying. Hubei is noted for its black smoked apricots.

Archaeological evidence shows that apricot cultivation had occurred in Kashmir by the 2nd millenium BCE. 

==== Western Eurasia and the Mediterranean region ====
Apricot stones from the Chalcolithic era have been found at Garni and Shengavit in Armenia. The common apricot was known in Armenia during ancient times, and has been cultivated there for so long that it was previously thought to have originated there. Its scientific name &quot;Prunus armeniaca&quot; (Armenian plum) derives from that assumption. For example, Belgian arborist Baron de Poerderlé, writing in the 1770s, asserted, &quot;Cet arbre tire son nom de l&#x27;Arménie, province d&#x27;Asie, d&#x27;où il est originaire et d&#x27;où il fut porté en Europe ...&quot; (&quot;this tree takes its name from Armenia, province of Asia, where it is native, and whence it was brought to Europe ...&quot;). A large variety of apricots, around 50, are grown in Armenia today.

Apricots have been cultivated in Persia since antiquity, and dried ones were an important commodity on Persian trade routes. Apricots remain an important fruit in modern-day Iran.

Egyptians usually dry apricots, add sweetener, and then use them to make a drink called &quot;amar al-dīn&quot;.

Its introduction to Greece is attributed to Alexander the Great.

An article on Apricot cultivation in Andalusia of Spain is brought down in Ibn al-&#x27;Awwam&#x27;s 12th-century agricultural work, &quot;Book on Agriculture&quot;.

In England during the 17th century, apricot oil was used in herbalism treatments intended to act against tumors, swelling, and ulcers.

In the 17th century, English settlers brought the apricot to the English colonies in the New World. Most of modern American production of apricots comes from the seedlings carried to the West Coast by Spanish missionaries. Almost all U.S. commercial production is in California, with some in Washington and Utah.

=== Uses ===

Seeds or kernels of the apricot grown in central Asia and around the Mediterranean may be substituted for bitter almonds. The Italian liqueur amaretto and amaretti biscotti are flavoured with extract of apricot kernels rather than almonds. Oil pressed from these cultivar kernels, and known as oil of almond, has been used as cooking oil. Kernels contain between 2.05% and 2.40% hydrogen cyanide, but consumption after proper processing is sufficient to reduce harmful effects.

== Etymology ==
The scientific name &quot;armeniaca&quot; was first used by Gaspard Bauhin in his &quot;Pinax Theatri Botanici&quot; (page 442), referring to the species as &quot;Mala armeniaca&quot; &quot;Armenian apple&quot;. It is sometimes stated that this came from Pliny the Elder, but it was not used by Pliny. Linnaeus took up Bauhin&#x27;s epithet in the first edition of his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753.

The name &quot;apricot&quot; is probably derived from a tree mentioned as &quot;praecocia&quot; by Pliny. Pliny says &quot;We give the name of apples (&quot;mala&quot;) ... to peaches (&quot;persica&quot;) and pomegranates (&quot;granata&quot;) ...&quot; Later in the same section he states &quot;The Asiatic peach ripens at the end of autumn, though an early variety (&quot;praecocia&quot;) ripens in summer – these were discovered within the last thirty years ...&quot;.

The classical authors connected Greek &quot;armeniaca&quot; with Latin &quot;praecocia&quot;: Pedanius Dioscorides&#x27; &quot; ... &quot; and Martial&#x27;s &quot;Armeniaca, et praecocia latine dicuntur&quot;. Putting together the &quot;Armeniaca&quot; and the &quot;Mala&quot; obtains the well-known epithet, but there is no evidence the ancients did it; &quot;Armeniaca&quot; alone meant the apricot. Nonetheless, the 12th century Andalusian agronomist Ibn al-&#x27;Awwam refers to the species in the title of chapter 40 of his &quot;Kitab al-Filaha&quot; as والتفاح الارمني, &quot;apple from Armenia&quot;, stating that it is the same as المشمش or البرقوق (&quot;al-mishmish&quot; or &quot;al-barqūq&quot;).

Accordingly, the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot; under &quot;apricot&quot; derives &quot;praecocia&quot; from &quot;praecoquus&quot;, &quot;cooked or ripened beforehand&quot; [in this case meaning &quot;early ripening&quot;], becoming Greek &quot;πραικόκιον&quot; &quot;praikókion&quot; &quot;apricot&quot; and Arabic البرقوق &quot;al-barqūq&quot;, a term that has been used for a variety of different members of the genus &quot;Prunus&quot; (it currently refers primarily to the plum in most varieties of Arabic, but some writers use it as a catchall term for &quot;Prunus&quot; fruit).

The English name comes from earlier &quot;abrecock&quot; in turn from the Middle French &quot;abricot&quot;, from Catalan &quot;abercoc&quot; in turn from Spanish &quot;albaricoque&quot;. The Spanish &quot;albaricoque&quot; were adaptation of the Arabic البرقوق (al-barqūq), dating from the Moorish rule of Spain. Al-barquq in its turn comes from the Aramaic/Syriac word of barquqyo.

However, in Argentina and Chile the word for &quot;apricot&quot; is &quot;damasco&quot;, which could indicate that, to the Spanish settlers of these countries, the fruit was associated with Damascus in Syria. The word &quot;damasco&quot; is also the word for &quot;apricot&quot; in Portuguese (both European and Brazilian, though in Portugal the words &quot;alperce&quot; and &quot;albricoque&quot; are also used).

== In culture ==

The Chinese associate the apricot with education and medicine. For instance, the classical word (literally: &#x27;apricot altar&#x27;) which means &quot;educational circle&quot;, is still widely used in written language. Zhuangzi, a Chinese philosopher in the 4th century BCE, told a story that Confucius taught his students in a forum surrounded by the wood of apricot trees. The association with medicine in turn comes from the common use of apricot kernels as a component in traditional Chinese medicine, and from the story of Dong Feng (董奉), a physician during the Three Kingdoms period, who required no payment from his patients except that they plant apricot trees in his orchard on recovering from their illnesses, resulting in a large grove of apricot trees and a steady supply of medicinal ingredients. The term &quot;Expert of the Apricot Grove&quot; (杏林高手) is still used as a poetic reference to physicians.

In Armenia, the wood of the apricot tree is used for making wood carvings such as the &quot;duduk&quot;, which is a popular wind instrument in Armenia and is also called &quot;apricot pipe&quot; (). Several hand-made souvenirs are also made from the apricot wood. The colour is used on the flag of Armenia.

<text>Fauntleroy Creek is a stream in the Fauntleroy neighborhood of West Seattle, Washington, United States. It flows for about a mile from its headwaters in the 32-acre (129,000 m2) ravine of Fauntleroy Park, to its outlet just south of the state ferry terminal on Puget Sound&#x27;s Fauntleroy Cove. Then, it drops 300 feet (100 m) vertically along the way, and it currently supports cutthroat trout and coho salmon.

The creek, park, and neighborhood were named after the cove, itself named by one George Davidson in 1857 after his fiancée, Ellinor Fauntleroy.

<doc id="446097" wikidata="Q361228" url="?curid=446097" title="Trent McCleary">
<text>Trent Kenneth McCleary (born September 8, 1972) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played for the Ottawa Senators, Boston Bruins, and Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL). His career was ended in 2000 after he took a slapshot to the throat, an injury that required life-saving surgery moments after the incident. He played 192 games, scoring 8 goals and 23 points.

==Playing career==
===Early career===
A native of Swift Current, Saskatchewan, McCleary played junior hockey in the Western Hockey League (WHL) with his hometown Swift Current Broncos beginning in 1988. He played a total of four seasons with the Broncos, winning the WHL championship and Memorial Cup with the team in 1988–89 though he played only three games with the team. He was a defensive forward in the WHL, but scored 50 points in his final year in helping the Broncos win a second championship. He added a goal in four games at the 1993 Memorial Cup.

The Ottawa Senators signed McCleary as an undrafted free agent upon his graduation, and he spent the majority of the 1993–94 season with the Thunder Bay Senators of the Colonial Hockey League (CoHL). He moved up to the Prince Edward Island Senators of the American Hockey League (AHL) in 1994–95 but missed three months of the season after suffering retinal damage to his right eye when he was hit in the face by a stick. Upon his recovery, McCleary returned wearing a visor that he would retain throughout his career.

He made his NHL debut in Ottawa in 1995–96, scoring 14 points in 75 games. The Senators traded McCleary, along with a draft pick, to the Boston Bruins for Shawn McEachern following the season. McCleary appeared in 59 games with the Bruins but was unable to come to an agreement on a new contract for the 1997–98 season. As a result, he signed to play in the International Hockey League (IHL), splitting the season between the Las Vegas Thunder and Detroit Vipers.

His rights ultimately released by the Bruins, McCleary signed with the Montreal Canadiens as a free agent in 1998, appearing in 46 NHL games in 1998–99. Early the following season, he again suffered a severe injury to his right eye, suffering a severed tear duct when he was hit in the face by an errant skate. He recovered, splitting the early part of the season between the Canadiens and the Quebec Citadelles of the AHL.

===Throat injury and retirement===
On January 29, 2000, during a game between the Canadiens and the Philadelphia Flyers, McCleary was critically injured when he was hit in the throat by a slapshot by the Flyers&#x27; Chris Therien; McCleary had dropped to the ice in order to block the shot. The shot fractured McCleary&#x27;s larynx and resulted in a collapsed lung. Unable to breathe, he rushed to the bench, collapsing upon his arrival. Medical staff worked to partially open his airway in the hallways of Molson Centre, actions which McCleary credits with saving his life. He was then rushed to a waiting ambulance and transported to hospital, where surgeons performed an emergency tracheotomy. He remained in full equipment during the procedure; hospital staff did not even have time to remove his skates.

Unable to speak immediately following his surgery, McCleary sent a written note to his teammates explaining he was all right while his surgeon revealed that he came &quot;as close ... as you could come&quot; to dying in the moments after he was struck. He met with the media two weeks following his injury, responding to questions via note pad, stating that he hoped to return to his career upon recovery. He regained the ability to talk after six weeks and several surgeries.

McCleary attempted a comeback at the start of the 2000–01 season. Despite doubts he would be capable of returning, the Canadiens signed him to a one-year, US$300,000 contract. He appeared in an exhibition game with the Canadiens, but found he was unable to play a full shift without running short of breath. He was examined by his doctor, who noted that because his air passage was left 15% narrower than before his injury, it was too dangerous for him to continue playing. As a result, on September 20, 2000, McCleary announced his retirement, calling it the &quot;toughest day&quot; in his seven-year career. The Canadiens kept him in the organization, naming him a WHL scout.

==Family==
McCleary&#x27;s parents Ken and Leah still live in Swift Current. He has an elder brother, Scott, and a younger sister, Shannon. He and his wife Tammy have three children.

<doc id="446099" wikidata="Q83456" url="?curid=446099" title="John Terry">
<text>John George Terry (born 7 December 1980) is an English professional football coach and former player who played as a centre-back. He was previously captain of Chelsea, the England national team and Aston Villa. He is regarded as one of the greatest defenders of his generation, as well as one of the best English and Premier League defenders ever.

Terry was named UEFA Club Defender of the Year in 2005, 2008 and 2009, PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year in 2005, and was included in the FIFPro World XI for five consecutive seasons, from 2005 to 2009. He was also named in the all-star squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the only English player to make the team. In 2024, Terry was inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame.

Terry is Chelsea’s most decorated captain in terms of trophies won. During his 19 years with the club, he led them to five Premier League titles, five FA Cups, three League Cups, one UEFA Europa League and one UEFA Champions League title. He is one of six players to have made over 500 appearances for Chelsea and is also the club&#x27;s all-time highest scoring defender. In 2007, he became the first captain to lift the FA Cup at the new Wembley Stadium in Chelsea&#x27;s 1–0 win over Manchester United, and also the first player to score an international goal there, scoring a header in England&#x27;s 1–1 draw with Brazil. In his final season at Chelsea in 2017, he became the first ever player to captain a team to the Premier League title on five occasions.

Following his departure from Chelsea, Terry spent one season with Aston Villa in the Championship before retiring, ultimately losing the 2018 Championship play-off final. He returned to Aston Villa a few months later as assistant manager to Dean Smith. The side went on to win the 2019 Championship play-off final to be promoted back to the Premier League. Terry left the role in July 2021. When Smith joined Leicester City as manager in April 2023, he appointed Terry to his coaching staff once again.

==Early life==
John George Terry was born on 7 December 1980 in Barking, Greater London. He attended Eastbury Comprehensive School and played for local Sunday league team Senrab.

==Club career==
===Chelsea===
====1991–1998: Early years====
As a boy, Terry was part of West Ham United&#x27;s youth system, joining them as a midfielder in 1991. He moved to Chelsea at 14, playing for the club&#x27;s youth and reserve teams. It was due to a shortage of central defenders that he was moved to centre-back, the position he played throughout his career. After finishing school, he joined the club on a YTS at age 16 and signed professional terms a year later.

====1998–2000: First appearances====
Terry made his Chelsea debut on 28 October 1998 as a late substitute in a League Cup tie with Aston Villa; his first start came later that season in an FA Cup third-round match, a 2–0 win over Oldham Athletic.

====2000: Loan to Nottingham Forest====
Terry spent a brief period on loan with Nottingham Forest in 2000 to build up his first-team experience and was the subject of interest from both Forest manager David Platt and Huddersfield Town manager Steve Bruce.

====2000–2002: First-team breakthrough====
In 2002, Terry was involved in an altercation with a bouncer at a West London nightclub with Chelsea teammate Jody Morris and Wimbledon&#x27;s Des Byrne, which led to him being charged with assault and affray. In August 2002, Terry was acquitted of the charges in court. During the affair, he was given a temporary ban from the English national team by The Football Association. Previously, along with Chelsea teammates Frank Lampard, Jody Morris, Eiður Guðjohnsen and former teammate Frank Sinclair, in September 2001 Terry was fined two weeks wages by Chelsea after drunkenly harassing grieving American tourists in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks. During his early days at Chelsea, Terry shared a flat with Andrew Crofts.

Terry began to establish himself in the Chelsea first team from the 2000–01 season, making 23 starts and was voted the club&#x27;s Player of the Year. He continued his progress during 2001–02, becoming a regular in the defence alongside club captain and France international Marcel Desailly. On 5 December 2001, he captained Chelsea for the first time, in a Premier League match against Charlton Athletic. Chelsea reached the FA Cup final, following wins against London rivals West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth and six rounds respectively, and Fulham in the semi-final – where Terry scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory. A virus denied Terry a place in the starting line-up for the final, although he came on as a second-half substitute while Chelsea lost 2–0 to Arsenal. In 2003–04 season, his performances led to him becoming vice-captain by manager Claudio Ranieri when Desailly was out of the team. He played well in the absence of the French international, forming a strong defensive partnership with William Gallas.

====2003–2008: Captaincy and successes====
Following Desailly&#x27;s departure, new Chelsea manager José Mourinho chose Terry as his club captain, a choice which was vindicated throughout the 2004–05 season as Chelsea won the Premier League title in record-breaking fashion with the best defensive record in Football League history with the most clean sheets and the most points accrued. He was voted Player of the Year by his fellow professionals in England and scored eight goals, including a late winner against Barcelona, in the UEFA Champions League. He was voted the best defender in the Champions League for the season. In September 2005, he was selected as a member of the World XI at the FIFPro awards. The team was chosen by a vote of professional footballers based in 40 countries.

Chelsea defended their Premier League title in 2005–06, earning 91 points, and confirming the title with a 3–0 victory against Manchester United.

In a match on 14 October 2006 against Reading, Terry had to take over in goal for Chelsea in the final minutes of the match after goalkeepers Petr Čech and Carlo Cudicini were injured and Chelsea had no substitutes remaining. Chelsea maintained a clean sheet and secured a 1–0 victory. On 5 November 2006, playing against Tottenham Hotspur, Terry was sent off for the first time in his Chelsea career after receiving two yellow cards as the Blues lost at White Hart Lane for the first time since 1987. Terry was charged with misconduct by the FA for questioning the integrity of match referee Graham Poll after the match. On 10 January 2007, Terry was ordered to pay £10,000 for the inappropriate conduct after he changed his mind and pleaded guilty to the FA.

In the 2006–07 season, Terry missed matches for Chelsea due to a recurring back problem. On 26 December 2006, José Mourinho stated that his captain might require surgery to fix the problem. In Terry&#x27;s absence Chelsea drew 2–2 at home to both Reading and Fulham over Christmas, draws that were to prove crucial in the destiny of the Premier League title for that season. On 28 December, Chelsea released a press statement saying Terry had had back surgery: &quot;The operation to remove a sequestrated lumbar intervertebral disc was successful.&quot; Although he was expected to return in the match against Wigan Athletic, which Chelsea won 3–2 thanks to a late goal from winger Arjen Robben, Terry was missing once again, due to the recurring back problem. He made his return in Chelsea&#x27;s 1–0 victory over Charlton Athletic on 3 February 2007 coming on in the 88th minute for Claude Makelele. Terry played his first 90 minutes of football for nearly three months in Chelsea&#x27;s 3–0 victory over Middlesbrough and received much applause from the Chelsea faithful. Didier Drogba scored two goals for Chelsea in that match, while the other goal came courtesy of an own goal from Abel Xavier of Middlesbrough.

Playing in the UEFA Champions League round of 16 away against Porto, he suffered another injury, this time to his ankle, and was set to miss the 2007 League Cup final against Arsenal, but managed to recover from the injury within days and played in the final. During the second half of the match, at an attacking corner, he threw himself at the ball with a diving header; Arsenal&#x27;s Abou Diaby, in an attempt to clear the ball, kicked Terry in the face. Terry was unconscious for several minutes, at which point he nearly swallowed his tongue. He was carried off the field on a stretcher and immediately transferred to the University Hospital of Wales. Terry discharged himself the same day and returned to the Millennium Stadium to celebrate his team&#x27;s 2–1 win. The only recollection he had of the second half is walking out onto the pitch and he did not remember the ten minutes he played prior to his injury. He went on to lead Chelsea to the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League, the third time in four years that Chelsea had made it to the final four of the competition. In May 2007, Terry captained Chelsea in the 2007 FA Cup final, in the first FA Cup final at the new Wembley Stadium.

Despite failing to agree terms to a new contract immediately following 2006–07, Terry stated on several occasions that he had no intention of leaving Chelsea. In late July, he signed a new five-year contract with a base salary of between £131,000 and £135,000 per week, making him the highest-paid player in the Premier League at the time.

On 16 December 2007, whilst playing against Arsenal, while going to clear a ball Terry&#x27;s foot was stepped on by Emmanuel Eboué and Terry had suffered 3 broken bones in his foot. He was expected to be out for at least three months but made a speedy recovery and managed to captain Chelsea to the 2008 League Cup final against Tottenham, which Chelsea lost 2–1. On 11 May 2008, whilst playing in the last league match of the season against Bolton, he collided with goalkeeper Petr Čech and suffered a partially dislocated elbow, which was eventually put back into place en route to the hospital. This injury did not prevent him playing in the 2008 UEFA Champions League final against Manchester United. The match went to penalties, and Terry missed a penalty which would have won Chelsea the match (and the Champions League). His standing leg slipped as he took his kick, and the ball missed the goal. Chelsea lost the shootout 6–5, which Terry reacted to by breaking down in tears. On 28 August 2008, Terry was awarded the Defender of The Year award from UEFA at the Champions League group stage draw in Monaco, together with Frank Lampard and Petr Čech, who received the award for their respective positions.

On 13 September 2008, Terry received the first straight red card of his career against Manchester City for rugby-tackling Jô. However, this was later rescinded on appeal. Despite being a defender, he occasionally scored important goals for Chelsea, such as in the Champions League Group A home match against Roma. However, Chelsea went on to lose the away leg 3–1.

====2008–2012: Double and Champions League====
In July 2009, Manchester City made a third bid for Terry, but Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti insisted Terry would remain at Chelsea. He made his debut for the new season against Premier League team Hull City, a match Chelsea won. On 8 November 2009, Terry scored the decisive goal in Chelsea&#x27;s match against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge to preserve their perfect home record for the season.

On 9 May 2010, Terry captained Chelsea as they won their fourth Premier League title after an 8–0 win against Wigan Athletic at Stamford Bridge. A week later, on 15 May 2010, Terry captained Chelsea as he won his fourth FA Cup medal, defeating Portsmouth in the final by 1–0 at Wembley Stadium.

On 31 December 2011, in a home match against Aston Villa, Terry captained the Chelsea team for the 400th time of his career, a record for the club.

In 2011, Terry ranked third in pass accuracy among players who attempted over 1,000 passes, completing 91.6% of his attempts. Only Barcelona player Xavi (93.0%) and Swansea City player Leon Britton (93.3%) were better.

On 24 April 2012, Terry was sent off for violent conduct after driving a knee into Barcelona&#x27;s Alexis Sánchez in an off-the-ball incident in the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League semi-final at the Camp Nou. Chelsea&#x27;s 3–2 aggregate victory over the holders qualified them for the final against Bayern Munich, for which Terry would be suspended. Terry later apologised for letting his teammates and Chelsea fans down. Terry scored his sixth league goal of the season, seventh in all competitions, in the final match of the season, a 2–1 victory over already-relegated Blackburn. The goal meant that it was Terry&#x27;s most prolific season and he told the Chelsea website, &quot;I am delighted with seven... It&#x27;s always good to end a league season with a win.&quot;

Even though Terry was suspended for the Champions League final, along with teammates Ramires, Branislav Ivanović and Raul Meireles, he took part in celebrations at the final whistle after Chelsea triumphed 4–3 on penalty kicks, with striker Didier Drogba netting the decisive penalty.

====2012–2017: Later career====
Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand did not shake hands with Terry before the match against QPR. Terry was banned for four matches when he was found guilty of racially abusing Ferdinand.

On 11 November 2012, in his first match back from the four-match ban, Terry scored his 50th goal for Chelsea against Liverpool. He went off injured in the 39th minute of the same match and was suspected to have ligament damage on his right knee, but a scan the next day showed that there was &quot;no significant damage&quot;. On 7 December 2012, new Chelsea manager Rafael Benítez confirmed Terry would not be back from injury in time to play in the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup. Terry&#x27;s knee injury kept him out of action for 16 first-team matches in total, including the Club World Cup defeat. He made a 45-minute comeback for Chelsea&#x27;s under-21 team on 10 January, before returning to the first team in a 2–2 draw away to Brentford in the FA Cup, that was his third match since he last played since November; 3 months prior.

On 17 April 2013, Terry scored twice in the derby match against Fulham that ended 3–0. On 13 May 2014, Terry signed a new one-year deal with the Blues.

On 18 October 2014, Terry captained Chelsea for the 500th time against Crystal Palace. In the next match, on 21 October, Terry scored in Chelsea&#x27;s record Champions League win against Slovenian team Maribor. Later, he scored Chelsea&#x27;s fastest-ever goal in the Champions League by heading in a goal after 90 seconds against Schalke 04.

In the League Cup final on 1 March 2015, Terry opened the scoring and was named Man of the Match in Chelsea&#x27;s 2–0 victory over Tottenham. On 26 March, Terry signed a one-year extension to his contract. On 26 April, Terry, along with five of his Chelsea teammates, was voted into the PFA Premier League Team of the Year. On 29 April, Terry became the joint highest-scoring defender in the Premier League with 38 goals, having scored the second goal in a 3–1 win over Leicester City. On 10 May, Terry surpassed David Unsworth as the highest-scoring defender in the Premier League after scoring his 39th in the opening five minutes against Liverpool, an eventual 1–1 draw.

On 23 August 2015, Terry received his first league red card for over five years, being dismissed for a foul on Salomón Rondón in a 3–2 win at West Bromwich Albion. On 15 January 2016, Terry scored an own goal in the 50th minute as well as his first goal of the season in the 98th minute, earning a 3–3 draw against Everton. On 1 February 2016, Terry announced that he would leave Chelsea in the summer of 2016, saying &quot;It&#x27;s not going to be a fairy-tale ending.&quot;

Although Terry announced in February that there were no talks held to discuss a new contract, on 18 May 2016, Terry signed a new one-year contract to remain at Chelsea until the end of the 2016–17 season. Ten days previously, Terry had been sent off in a 3–2 loss to Sunderland at the Stadium of Light in what was widely believed to have been his final appearance for the club.

During Antonio Conte&#x27;s first press conference as the new Chelsea manager, Conte confirmed that Terry would remain the club captain. On 11 September 2016, during the closing minutes of the match against Swansea City, Terry suffered an ankle injury and required crutches to leave the pitch after the final whistle.

On 8 January 2017, making his first start for Chelsea since an EFL Cup defeat to West Ham United in October 2016, Terry was given a straight red card for a foul on Lee Angol as Chelsea beat Peterborough United 4–1 in the FA Cup third round. On 17 April, he announced that he would be leaving Chelsea at the end of the 2016–17 season. After Chelsea celebrated their Premier League victory, Terry played his 717th and final match for Chelsea on 21 May in a 5–1 home win over Sunderland, coming off in the 28th minute (the substitution board went up in the 26th minute, the same as that of his shirt number), and received a guard of honour from his teammates. In December 2019, Terry was voted in Chelsea&#x27;s team of the decade as voted for by its fans.

===Aston Villa===
On 3 July 2017, Terry signed a one-year contract with Championship club Aston Villa on a free transfer. He was appointed as the captain for the 2017–18 season. He made his debut for Aston Villa on 5 August 2017 in a 1–1 home draw with Hull City in the Championship. Terry scored his only goal for Aston Villa in a 2–1 victory over Fulham in the Championship on 21 October.

On 30 May 2018, Terry left Aston Villa after the club failed to gain promotion to the Premier League as they lost 1–0 against Fulham in the Championship play-off final.

In September 2018, Terry underwent a medical with Spartak Moscow, but declined their offer of a contract, citing family reasons. He announced his retirement from playing on 7 October.

==International career==
Terry made his England debut in June 2003 against Serbia and Montenegro, and started his first match for England on 20 August 2003 at Portman Road, Ipswich, in a friendly against Croatia. England won 3–1. His main central defensive partner had been Rio Ferdinand. He played for his country at Euro 2004, and England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson stated that Terry was the first-choice centre-back, ahead of Sol Campbell.

In 2005 during a FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Poland, Terry wore England&#x27;s captain armband, replacing Michael Owen as captain after the latter was substituted.

He cemented his place in the England squad after being selected for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In a warm-up match for that tournament against Hungary on 30 May 2006, Terry scored his first goal for England, the team&#x27;s second in a 3–1 victory. Despite an injury scare in a friendly against Jamaica, he recovered to play in England&#x27;s opening fixture against Paraguay, a 1–0 victory. In the next match against Trinidad and Tobago, Carlos Edwards beat England&#x27;s Paul Robinson to a cross and as Stern John bundled a header towards the goal, Terry cleared the ball off the line with an overhead kick. In the quarter-final match against Portugal, Terry played the entire match, but England lost on penalties and he was left in tears with his fellow players. Six days later, he was the only English player to be named in the tournament&#x27;s all-star squad.

On 10 August 2006, Steve McClaren named John Terry as the England captain, succeeding David Beckham. McClaren said, &quot;Choosing a captain is one of the most important decisions a coach has to make. I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;ve got the right man in John Terry. I&#x27;m convinced he will prove to be one of the best captains England has ever had.&quot; Terry scored a goal on his debut as the England captain, in a friendly international against Greece. This was the first goal of the match and also the first goal during McClaren&#x27;s reign as manager. However, with Terry as captain, England did not qualify for UEFA Euro 2008 – their first absence from a tournament finals since the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Midway through the qualification campaign, Terry had accepted that he would &quot;bear full responsibility&quot; should England fail to qualify.

On 1 June 2007, Terry became the first player in the senior England team to score an international goal at the new Wembley Stadium when he scored England&#x27;s goal from a header in the box after a free kick cross by David Beckham in a 1–1 draw with Brazil. Almost a year later, he scored a similar headed goal once again from a free kick cross by David Beckham to put England 1–0 up against the United States on 28 May 2008.

Terry was confirmed as the England captain in August, and captained England in qualifying for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. During his first match after being reinstated as the permanent England captain, a friendly against Czech Republic, he was given a torrid time by Milan Baroš and was turned far too easily when Baros scored the first goal for his team. The match ended 2–2 with Joe Cole scoring a fortunate equaliser for England in the 92nd minute of the match. He scored his first competitive England goal against Ukraine on 1 April 2009, in the qualifiers for the World Cup, grabbing a late winner after earlier giving away a free kick which led to Andriy Shevchenko&#x27;s equalising goal for Ukraine. England sealed their place in the final tournament in September 2009, following a 5–1 home win against Croatia.

On 5 February 2010, following allegations regarding Terry&#x27;s private life, England manager Fabio Capello announced that Terry was removed as the captain of the England team. He was replaced by fellow defender Rio Ferdinand.

At the 2010 FIFA World Cup, England started with two draws against the United States and Algeria, which received heavy criticism from the English media.

Two days after the Algeria match in a media interview, Terry hinted at dissatisfaction with Capello&#x27;s team selection and stated that the players were bored with little to do in the evenings at their training base; he also said that a clear-the-air team meeting would take place that evening. The next day, Capello responded by saying that Terry had made &quot;a very big mistake&quot; in challenging his authority to the media.

On 19 March 2011, Capello reinstated Terry as England captain following a long-term injury to previous captain Rio Ferdinand. On 3 February 2012, with Terry due to stand trial due to allegations that Terry had racially abused QPR&#x27;s Anton Ferdinand, the FA stripped Terry of the England captaincy for the second time. This led to Capello resigning.

Terry was named in new manager Roy Hodgson&#x27;s squad for UEFA Euro 2012 while Rio Ferdinand was left out, leading to heavy speculation that this was to avoid potential conflict due to Terry&#x27;s upcoming trial for racially abusing Ferdinand&#x27;s brother Anton. Terry played 90 minutes in all four of England&#x27;s matches at the Euros.

Terry announced on 23 September 2012 he had retired from international football.

==Style of play==
Described by &quot;ESPN&quot; as a &quot;commanding, no-nonsense style of player&quot;, Terry was recognized for his physicality and aggressive defending style, though some critics noted that he struggled against quicker forwards. He usually played as a centre-back, although he initially started out playing as a midfielder in his youth. A tall defender, he excelled in the air, which enabled him to defend crosses and high balls effectively, and also made him a goal threat for his team in the opposing penalty area, despite his defensive playing role. Although he was primarily known for his aggressive tackling, he was also an intelligent player, who was recognised by pundits for his positioning and anticipation, as well as his ability to read the game, which compensated for his lack of pace or athleticism, in particular in his later career; he also stood out for his leadership and bravery throughout his career, as well as his ability organise the back–line. Despite not being a particularly fast player, however, in particular over short distances, Samuel Eto&#x27;o once described Terry as being &quot;surprisingly quick&quot;, while in his youth, a 2003 match report from an international friendly against Croatia described &quot;speed and tackling ability&quot; as his strengths, while instead citing his reading of the game and ability to defend set pieces in the air as areas in need of improvement. Regarded as one of the best defenders in the world at his peak, he is considered to be one of the greatest central defenders of his generation, as well as one of the best English and Premier League defenders ever.

Despite the praise he received in the media for his defensive skills, critical opinion on Terry&#x27;s technical ability was frequently divided; throughout his career, he was often paired with an intelligent, more technical and more mobile ball–playing centre-back, such as Ricardo Carvalho at Chelsea or Rio Ferdinand with England, which complemented Terry&#x27;s more physical playing style as a &quot;stopper&quot;, and also provided cover for him, as his lack of pace saw him struggle at times in teams that played a high defensive line. While some pundits, such as Chris Wright of ESPN or Robin Bairner and Sulmaan Ahmad of &quot;Goal&quot;, have cited Terry&#x27;s technique as a weakness, with Tom Sheen of &quot;The Independent&quot; also noting that his general reputation for lacking speed or elegance in possession and his reluctance to carry the ball out from the back saw him perceived as &quot;a bit of a plodder when on the ball,&quot; others, such as Jamie Carragher and Jamie Redknapp, have instead argued that his ability on the ball and composure in possession was an underrated aspect of his game, which did not get as much attention as his tactical sense. During one of Terry&#x27;s final matches for Chelsea, in a 2017 article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Barney Ronay noted that &quot;Terry lined up at the heart of the central defensive three,&quot; and described him as: &quot;A little heavier, clanking about like an eager old tin man, he still has an excellent touch although, had he played much deeper in the second half, he might have been best served bringing out a shovel and digging a trench in front of his own goal.&quot; In 2009, &quot;UEFA.com&quot; praised Terry for his ability to control the ball with his chest. Moreover, although Terry&#x27;s passing was initially cited as being in need of improvement in his early career, his distribution throughout his career was also generally solid and reliable, which often saw him complete many passes throughout the course of a season with a high success rate, although he usually favoured making simpler short passes on the ground; Michael Cox described his distribution as &quot;underrated&quot; in 2015, however, while Redknapp and Carragher have both noted that Terry was also capable of playing long balls with either foot, despite being naturally right–footed, a trait which Sam Wallace and Tom Sheen of &quot;The Independent&quot; also noticed in 2011 and 2014 respectively, with the latter describing Terry as &quot;an exceptionally two-footed footballer,&quot; who &quot;will show off a range of passing with either foot.&quot; As Sheen notes, Terry&#x27;s ability with either foot often allowed him to play as a left–sided centre-back in a four–man defensive line throughout his career. In 2011, Terry was the world&#x27;s third best passer for players with over 1,000 passes, with a 91.6% pass accuracy rate. Only Barcelona player Xavi (93.0%) and Swansea City player Leon Britton (93.3%) were better. He also played in a three–man back–line on occasion, in particular in his later career under Chelsea manager Antonio Conte, although he struggled to adapt to this formation due to his lack of pace as a result of his advancing age. Terry has been involved in multiple incidents that received significant media attention, including legal disputes and on-pitch altercations.

==Coaching career==
On 10 October 2018, Terry was appointed assistant head coach of Aston Villa, with newly appointed Dean Smith as head coach. On 26 July 2021, Terry departed Aston Villa after three years at the club, in which they achieved promotion to, and consolidated their position in the Premier League. He described Dean Smith as a great influence on his coaching career. In December 2021, his return to Chelsea, commencing in January 2022 in a coaching consultancy role was announced.

Following the announcement of Dean Smith as the new Leicester City manager on 10 April 2023, Terry was appointed to his coaching staff once again.

In July 2023, Terry returned to Chelsea as the club&#x27;s Academy coach.

==Sponsorship==
On the UK version of &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 6&quot;, Terry appears on the front cover with Brazil international Adriano.

==Family and personal life==
Terry is married to his childhood sweetheart Toni (née Poole). On 18 May 2006, Terry and Toni had twins, a boy and a girl. They married at Blenheim Palace in June 2007.

Terry was a Manchester United supporter growing up. His older brother, Paul (born 1979), is a former professional footballer, having played for Dagenham &amp; Redbridge and Yeovil Town. Terry&#x27;s nephew, Frankie, is currently a professional footballer for Colchester United.

In 2016, Terry paid the £1,600 funeral costs for an eight-year-old Chelsea fan with leukaemia who died after an unsuccessful bone marrow transplantation.

Terry co-owns custom swimwear company Thomas Royall with fellow footballers Sam Saunders and Liam Ridgewell.

===Legal issues===
In September 2001, Terry and three teammates were fined two weeks&#x27; wages by Chelsea for an incident involving American tourists at a Heathrow airport bar in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. In January 2002, Terry, Chelsea teammate Jody Morris and Des Byrne of Wimbledon were charged with assault and affray after a confrontation with a nightclub bouncer. Terry was banned from selection for the England team for the duration of the case, though he was ultimately cleared of all charges. In 2009, Terry was investigated by Chelsea and the FA for allegedly taking money from an undercover reporter for a private tour of Chelsea&#x27;s training ground. The club responded that it was &quot;confident that at no time did Terry ask for or accept money in relation to visits to the training ground.&quot;

====Extramarital affair allegations====
In January 2010, a super-injunction was imposed by a High Court judge preventing the media from reporting allegations that Terry had had a four-month affair in late 2009 with Vanessa Perroncel, the former girlfriend of Wayne Bridge, his former Chelsea and England teammate. The injunction was lifted a week later, and the British media – especially the tabloid press – covered the rumours in great detail in the days following. The &quot;News of the World&quot; and the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; subsequently printed apologies to Perroncel for breaching her privacy and stated that the story was &quot;untrue in any case&quot;. Perroncel maintains that the alleged affair never took place. The allegations led to then-England manager Fabio Capello removing Terry from the captaincy on 5 February 2010, replacing him with Rio Ferdinand. Terry was reinstated as captain the following year.

On 27 February 2010, Terry played against Bridge for the first time since the incident, where in a highly publicised incident prior to the match, Bridge refused to shake hands with Terry.

====Racial abuse allegations====
In November 2011, Terry was placed under police investigation following an allegation of racist abuse made at Anton Ferdinand during a match between Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers on 23 October 2011. Video footage circulated on the internet led to accusations that Terry called Ferdinand a &quot;fucking black cunt.&quot; In response to the video footage, Terry claimed that he was actually asking Ferdinand, &quot;Oi, Anton, do you think I called you a black cunt?&quot; On 21 December 2011, he was charged with using racist language by the Crown Prosecution Service. In February 2012, the Football Association stripped Terry of his England captaincy for the second time, stating that Terry would not captain the national team until the racial abuse allegations against him were resolved. When the trial began in July 2012, Terry entered a not guilty plea and was acquitted of the charge on 13 July 2012.

On 27 July 2012, the FA charged Terry for using &quot;abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour&quot; which &quot;included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Ferdinand.&quot; The FA had delayed the charge until after the conclusion of Terry&#x27;s criminal trial. Terry denied the charge. On the eve of the FA&#x27;s hearing, Terry announced his retirement from the national team, saying his position had become &quot;untenable&quot; due to the disciplinary charge. On 27 September 2012, the hearing concluded with Terry being found guilty; he was punished with a four-match ban and a £220,000 fine. In October 2012, Terry decided not to appeal against the verdict and his four-match ban and issued an apology for &quot;the language [he] used in the game&quot; and stated that it was &quot;not acceptable on the football field or indeed in any walk of life.&quot;

===In popular culture===
Terry has been represented in a meme which pictures him taking part in great moments in history and fiction, following his decision to come on to the pitch to lift the European Cup in full kit despite being suspended for the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final; he repeated this when Chelsea won the 2013 UEFA Europa League final, in which he did not play due to injury. These included the fall of the Berlin Wall, the freeing of Nelson Mandela and the triumph of Rocky Balboa. Over the summer of 2012 this developed into his celebrating current sporting achievements such as 2012 Summer Olympics medal wins by Team GB.

<text>The Liberal Party of New York is a political party in New York. Its platform supports a standard set of socially liberal policies, including abortion rights, increased spending on education, and universal health care.

==History==
===Creation===
Members of the Communist Party USA started joining the American Labor Party and Israel Amter, chair of the Communist Party, called for the &quot;building of the American Labor Party&quot;. Although its constitution specifically barred Communists from the organization, there was no enforcement for this provision and large numbers flocked to registration as ALP members from the Communist-led United Electrical Workers, Transport Workers, and State, County, and Municipal Workers. Communists in the ALP opposed reelecting Roosevelt in the 1940 presidential election and the party&#x27;s leadership started an attempt to remove them from the party. The party condemned the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Fights broke out at the party&#x27;s convention, where Roosevelt was given the nomination despite an attempted resolution condemning Roosevelt.

Sidney Hillman, a member of the left-wing, threatened to have the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America become involved in the 1944 state committee elections if the party&#x27;s leadership voted against a proposal to increase union control over the party. The right-wing rejected it. Adolf A. Berle and Eleanor Roosevelt supported the party&#x27;s right-wing while Franklin Roosevelt wanted to avoid conflict between the factions. Fiorello La Guardia proposed a compromise in which the state executive committee would be divided between the factions and no communist would be on the election slate. Hillman accepted the proposal, but David Dubinsky rejected it. The left-wing won 620 of the 750 committee seats.

1,124 delegates attended the convention from May 19 to 20, 1944, where Franklin D. Roosevelt was given the presidential nomination. Many of the leaders of the Liberal Party were former members of the Socialist Party of America and American Labor Party. Paul Blanshard, August Claessens, and Harry W. Laidler were among the founders. John L. Childs was selected to serve as the party&#x27;s chair. The party was given $50,000 by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and spent $200,000 during the 1944 election, three times what the ALP spent. The party had 150 union affiliates by 1948. Alex Rose was one of the strongest leaders in the party until his death in 1976. Raymond Harding succeeded Rose as chair and served until 2002.

===Rise===


The Liberals attempted to give their mayoral nomination to Wendell Willkie, but he died and they instead nominated Jonah J. Goldstein. Dubinsky stated that the &quot;national third party project died&quot; with Willkie. Berle replaced Childs as the party&#x27;s chair in 1947. He did not support the creation of a national party and was more supportive of the Democrats. The party was a member of A. Philip Randolph&#x27;s National Educational Committee for a New Party from 1945 to 1947. Louis P. Goldberg and Ira Palestin were elected to the New York City Council in the 1945 election, becoming the first elected Liberals. The party supported James M. Mead and Herbert H. Lehman in the 1946 gubernatorial and senatorial elections, but both lost and less than 180,000 people voted on the Liberal line compared to over 400,000 votes on the ALP line. The party received enough votes in the gubernatorial election to become a recognized party.

In 1947, the Liberal, Communist, ALP, Socialist, and other third parties successfully opposed legislation to increase the threshold to become a recognized party, but the Liberals supported the Wilson Pakula act, which was opposed by the Communists and ALP. The Liberals unsuccessfully opposed the referendum to end the usage of proportional representation for city council elections in New York City. The Liberals lost their seats on the New York City council after the end of proportional representation.

The Liberals supported Henry A. Wallace&#x27;s cabinet appointment causing &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; to accuse the ALP and Liberals of grooming him for a presidential run in the 1948 election. However, Liberal opinion soured on Wallace with Dubinsky calling him a &quot;darling of the fellow travelers&quot; and Berle calling him the front man for Communists. In March 1947, the Liberal Party Policy Committee called for a presidential campaign by Dwight D. Eisenhower. The passage of Hubert Humphrey&#x27;s pro-civil rights plank at the 1948 Democratic National Convention was one of the main reasons the Liberals endorsed Harry S. Truman on September 1, 1948. Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives mainly with the Liberal nomination, and the Four Freedoms Party ballot line obtained with the aid of the Liberals, in 1949.

The 1949 New York City mayoral election was the first time that the Liberals received more votes than the ALP in a city-wide election. Berle, Dubinsky, and Rose pushed for Herbert H. Lehman to seek the Democratic nomination in the 1949 U.S. Senate election and the number of votes he received on the Liberal ballot line was greater than his margin of victory. Lehman received more votes on the Liberal ballot line than the ALP candidate in the 1950 U.S. Senate election and the Liberals aided in ALP member Vito Marcantonio lose reelection. The Liberals replaced the ALP, the &quot;shoddy tool of Moscow&quot; according to Ben Davidson, as Row C on the ballot. The ALP lost its ballot access after the 1954 gubernatorial election and dissolved in 1956. A special election for New York City council president was held in 1951 to fill the vacancy created by Vincent R. Impellitteri ascending to the mayoralty. The party saw this as a chance to elect their first citywide official, but considered running a fusion campaign with Newbold Morris or Jacob Javits. The Liberals nominated Rudolph Halley on the condition that he would not accept the Democratic nomination. Halley won the election.


The party was divided on who to support for the Democratic presidential nomination during the 1952 presidential election. Berle supported U.S. Senator Paul Douglas while other party members supported Estes Kefauver, W. Averell Harriman, or Adlai Stevenson II. Stevenson&#x27;s nomination &quot;delighted&quot; the Liberals according to Davidson. The party opposed John Sparkman&#x27;s selection as Stevenson&#x27;s running mate and Dubinsky threatened to withhold the party&#x27;s nomination from Stevenson. However, Berle, Dubinsky, and Rose later argued in favor of endorsing the ticket due to them not having any other candidates. In the concurrent senatorial election the party opposed Democratic nominee John Cashmore and instead ran George Counts as their own candidate.

Berle&#x27;s tenure as chair ended in July 1955, and Counts was selected to replace him. Counts stepped down in April 1959, and Paul R. Hays became acting chair before being elected chair in 1960. During the 1956 election, Rose helped convince Kefauver to end his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. The party supported Kefauver&#x27;s vice-presidential nomination bid and opposed John F. Kennedy. The Liberals endorsed the Stevenson and Kefauver presidential ticket on September 11. Vincent Corsall was elected mayor of Oswego solely with the Liberal nomination in 1957, but lost reelection in 1959. The party attempted to recruit Thurgood Marshall to run against Adam Clayton Powell Jr. in the 1958 U.S. House election, but he declined.

===Zenith===

In 1960, the Liberal Party endorsed Kennedy for president. On September 14, 1960, he accepted the nomination, giving almost a 20-minute speech defending American Liberalism and his campaign. Here he also gave a famous quote about liberalism, stating &quot;I&#x27;m proud to say I&#x27;m a Liberal.&quot; The Conservative Party of New York State was formed in 1962, and saw the Liberals as a model to follow. The party wanted to pressure the Republicans further to the right and opposed Nelson Rockefeller and Javits, both of whom had been nominated by the Liberals in the past. The 1962 gubernatorial election was the worst performance for the Liberals at that point. The party aided Robert F. Kennedy in gaining the Democratic senatorial nomination in the 1964 election and also gave him their ballot line. Kennedy won the election, but only received around 70,000 more votes than the Conservative ballot line.

The party gave its nomination to Republican nominee John Lindsay in the 1965 New York City mayoral election, despite opposition from members like Luigi Antonini, in exchange for one-third of the mayoral appointments, money for the Liberal campaign, and a citywide Liberal candidate. The Liberals pressured President Lyndon B. Johnson to not become involved in the election and Dubinsky wrote to him about how the ALP endorsed both Roosevelt and La Guardia. Johnson gave his endorsement to the Democratic mayoral nominee late in the election. The Liberals spent $300,000 during the campaign and the number of votes Lindsay received on their ballot line was greater than his margin of victory. Timothy Costello, the party&#x27;s chair, was given the position of deputy mayor in Lindsay&#x27;s administration. Costello resigned as chair in order to take this position and was replaced by Donald S. Harrington.

During the 1966 gubernatorial election, Roosevelt lobbied the party&#x27;s leadership for their nomination for months. Dubinsky &quot;broke out the 20-year-old scotch&quot; during a meeting according Roosevelt&#x27;s friends. Dubinsky argued for supporting Roosevelt using polls showing him receiving at least one-fourth of the vote. Louis Stulberg and other leaders of the ILGWU opposed Roosevelt due to him not staying with the party after the 1949 election. Roosevelt won the party&#x27;s nomination. Murray Kempton stated that the convention was under the thumb of &quot;comrade secretary&quot; Davidson, who chaired the convention. Harrington was selected as the lieutenant gubernatorial nominee. Roosevelt received the highest number of votes for any Liberal gubernatorial nominee in history. However, the Liberals received less votes than the Conservatives and fell from Row C to Row D.

The party was divided during the 1968 Democratic primary as Costello and multiple upstate county chairs supported Eugene McCarthy while Stulberg and the ILGWU supported Johnson. The pro-Johnson elements of the party switched their support to Humphrey after Johnson dropped out. The party voted to endorse Humphrey on September 4. The first statewide primary in the party&#x27;s history occurred during the 1968 U.S. Senate election. Rose wanted the party to endorse Javits, who they helped elect to the U.S. House in 1946, as he could easily gain them votes and they did not have control over who the Democratic nominee would be. However, left-wingers in the party were critical of Javits&#x27; stance on Vietnam and support for Richard Nixon. Stulberg believed that supporting Javits would help Nixon win the presidential election. Percy Sutton contested the nomination, but withdrew after the state committee made Javits the party&#x27;s nominee. The ILGWU put Murray Baron onto the primary ballot, but Javits defeated him.

The ILGWU made a push to reform the party after the 1966 election. They wanted to reduce his power over the party. 25-30% of the party&#x27;s budget came from the ILGWU, but started reducing its support in protest of Rose. The ILGWU voted to disaffiliate from the Liberals in January 1969. ILGWU accused the party of being a &quot;tail on the Republican kite&quot; and was critical of Lindsay&#x27;s mayoralty. Lindsay ran for reelection in the 1969 New York City mayoral election, but lost the Republican primary. He was given the Liberal nomination prior to the primary and continued his campaign as their nominee. Lindsay won reelection and four Liberals were elected to the city council. This was the first time they won seats on the city council since 1949. Rose and the Liberals became a major part of Lindsay&#x27;s administration in his second term. The Liberals, as the official minority party in the city council, had additional patronage possibilities. Clingan was selected to be their caucus leader. Liberals for New Politics, a group seeking to reform the party, was formed by Clingan and city councilor Charles Taylor. They ran Paul Siminoff for chair against Rose in 1970, but Rose was reelected. Clingan and Taylor later left the party to join the Democrats.

===Decline===
Arthur Goldberg, a friend of Rose, won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in the 1970 election. Harrington and Costello were nominated as place holder candidates for governor and senator. Liberals for New Politics accused Rose of using them to gain more time to make a political deal. Goldberg appealed to the Liberals in a nine page letter to Harrington while Rockefeller sought to have Harrington run, where he would serve as a spoiler candidate. Goldberg was given the gubernatorial nomination while Charles Goodell was given the senatorial nomination. Both of them lost their elections, with Goodell coming third behind Conservative nominee James L. Buckley. The number of votes cast on the party&#x27;s ballot line declined by almost 60% between the 1968 and 1972 presidential elections while Conservatives received twice as many votes.

Rose told Lindsay to not seek reelection in the 1973 election. Rose, Javits, and Rockefeller organized a meeting to attempt a Liberal and Republican fusion campaign. Rose wanted Javits to run, but he declined. Rose and Rockefeller supported Robert F. Wagner Jr. and the Liberal Policy Committee endorsed him. However, Wagner withdrew from the election as he was not willing to contest a primary. The Liberals ran Albert H. Blumenthal while the Republicans ran John J. Marchi. Liberals for New Politics ran J. Stanley Shaw against Blumenthal in the primary, but lost and Shaw instead endorsed Democratic nominee Abraham Beame, who won the election. Henry Stern was the only Liberal elected to the New York City council in 1973.

The Liberals initially supported Walter Mondale during the 1976 presidential primaries, but he withdrew. The party was divided between Humphrey, Henry M. Jackson, Mo Udall, and Jimmy Carter. The party, despite a lack of enthusiasm, endorsed Carter, but played a minor role in the campaign due to new laws requiring campaign committees approve all literature and campaign spending limits. Rose died on December 28, 1976, and Davidson&#x27;s wife collapsed on the same day, causing him to retire as executive director.

A collective leadership of Davidson, Harrington, Ray Harding, Ed Morrison, Nicholas Gyory, and Herbert Rose was formed after Rose&#x27;s death. Harding became the dominant member and was being referred to as the party&#x27;s leader by 1980. The party initially planned on endorsing Republican Roy M. Goodman in the 1977 New York City mayoral election, but Governor Hugh Carey organized a meeting where he agreed to veto a bill moving primaries from September to June and convinced Mario Cuomo to run. A special mayoral search committee voted in favor of Cuomo over Goodman and Ed Koch and the state committee designated Cuomo as the party&#x27;s candidate. Cuomo lost the Democratic primary to Koch, but continued his campaign as a Liberal. Cuomo lost to Koch, but the Liberals retained their one city council seat. The party hoped to rise to Row C after the 1978 gubernatorial election due to vote splitting between the Conservative and Right to Life parties, but the Liberals instead fell to Row E.

The Liberals broke with the Democrats at the presidential level for the first time in the 1980 election. The party gave its ballot line to John B. Anderson instead of Carter. Javits also ran as a Liberal in the senatorial election after losing the Republican nomination to Al D&#x27;Amato. Anderson and Javits both lost, but their vote totals were greater than the Republican margin of victory. The party was accused of selling its endorsement to Daniel Patrick Moynihan for $100,000 in the 1982 U.S. Senate election.

Rudy Giuliani received the party&#x27;s nomination in the 1989 and 1993 New York City mayoral elections. The &quot;New York Times&quot; criticized their endorsement as &quot;little more than a political tool&quot; and the &quot;work of one wily politician&quot;, Harding. Giuliani won the 1993 election due to the votes he received on the Liberal ballot line. A Liberal was made deputy mayor in Giuliani&#x27;s administration and 23 Liberals received appointments. Two of Harding&#x27;s sons also received positions. The Liberal vote fell to 71,017, a small number over the 50,000 needed to retain ballot access, despite supporting Cuomo&#x27;s successful campaign in the 1990 gubernatorial election. The party ran an independent campaign with Betsy McCaughey for governor in the 1998 election, but only received 77,915 votes. The party&#x27;s position as the left-of-center and pro-labor party was being taken by the Working Families Party. The WFP received more votes than the Liberals in the 2000 presidential and U.S. Senate elections.

H. Carl McCall, the Democratic nominee in the 2002 gubernatorial election, announced that he would not accept the party&#x27;s nomination. McCall stated that Harding and the Liberals were &quot;an embarrassment to New York&#x27;s political life&quot;. The Liberals gave their nomination to Andrew Cuomo, who dropped out and endorsed McCall. Cuomo remained on the ballot, but did not campaign. The Liberals lost their ballot access after receiving 15,761 votes. David Dinkins, who lost to Giuliani, said that he was &quot;glad they are out of business&quot;. The party closed its office in 2003 and the Policy Committee dissolved. The Liberal Party also suffered allegations of corruption and of abandoning its liberal roots in favor of a system of patronage and nepotism – Harding relatives were given appointments in the Giuliani administration, and it was argued that it was a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; deal, since Giuliani is not generally considered a &quot;liberal&quot; by New York City standards. In 1999, &quot;The New York Observer&quot; called it an &quot;ideologically bereft institution more interested in patronage than in policy.&quot; In 2009, Raymond Harding pleaded guilty to having accepted more than $800,000 in exchange for doing political favors for Alan G. Hevesi, a New York politician who was a frequent Liberal Party endorsee.

In 2005, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported that incumbent New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, then a liberal Republican who favors abortion rights and same-sex marriage, was seeking to revive the Liberal Party – and thereby run on a &quot;Republican/Liberal&quot; ticket – in an effort to win over Democratic voters in the overwhelmingly Democratic city. Bloomberg was re-elected in 2005, but nothing came of these rumors of his campaign being used as a basis for a Liberal Party revival. In 2006, for the first time since the early 1940s, there was no Liberal candidate for Governor. Edward Culvert was the party&#x27;s candidate for governor in 2010, but the party lacked the resources to muster the necessary petition with 15,000 valid signatures of registered voters to get him onto the ballot. The Liberal Party&#x27;s current chairman is Jack Olchin. Its executive director is Martin Hassner. Prior to former New York City Parks Commissioner Henry Stern taking over as chairman in 2004, the Liberal Party&#x27;s longtime leader was Raymond Harding (born Branko Hochwald; January 31, 1935 – August 9, 2012). The Liberal Party cross-endorsed Republican candidate Bob Turner in the New York&#x27;s 9th congressional district special election, 2011, marking one of the rare times the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party have agreed on a candidate other than an unopposed one.

Raymond Harding died August 9, 2012, in the Bronx of cancer, aged 77, depriving the Liberal Party of its best-known long-term figure. While the Liberal Party still has a website, the last election in which it endorsed candidates, all on other party lines, was the New York City Council races in 2017.

==Political positions==
The party supported Truman&#x27;s Fair Deal. During the 1949 election, they supported repealing the Taft–Hartley Act, allowing the Communist Party to legally exist, expanding Social Security, and the creation of a national healthcare system. It supported a referendum on the status of Puerto Rico. The party opposed the Mundt–Nixon Bill and McCarran Internal Security Act, although Berle supported an amended version of the Mundt–Nixon Bill. Berle opposed banning the Communist Party. Palestin called for an investigation into the Communist Party&#x27;s involving in the deaths or disappearance of Juliet Stuart Poyntz, Carlo Tresca, and Leon Trotsky. Palestin supported seating a Communist replacement on the city council following the death of Peter Cacchione, but Goldberg opposed it.

At the 1966 state constitutional convention Harrington argued for maintaining the state&#x27;s Blaine Amendment. However, the convention voted 130 to 48 to eliminate it. He also unsuccessfully argued to ban the usage of state funds to construct nonpublic schools. Harrington opposed the United States entering the Vietnam War, but Rose wanted to avoid having the party taking a stance on the issue. Multiple county affiliates in upstate New York passed a resolution calling for bombing to end, negotiations with North Vietnam, and aid to rebuild Vietnam. On June 29, 1968, the state committee passed a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire during negotiations.

<text>The gusle () or lahuta (; related to English &quot;lute&quot;) is a bowed single-stringed musical instrument (and musical style) traditionally used in the Dinaric Alps, primarily by Serbs, but also other South Slavic nations and Albanians. The instrument is always accompanied by singing; musical folklore, specifically epic poetry. The gusle player holds the instrument vertically between the knees, with the left hand fingers on the string. The string is never pressed to the neck, giving a harmonic and unique sound.

Singing to the accompaniment of the Gusle as a part of Serbia&#x27;s intangible cultural heritage was inscribed in 2018 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO.

==Origin==
There is no consensus about the origin of the instrument. 7th-century Byzantine Greek historian Theophylact Simocatta ( 630) wrote about &quot;small lyres&quot; brought by the South Slavs who settled the Balkans; some researchers believe that this might have been the gusle. Others, such as F. Sachs, believe that the gusle has an Oriental origin, brought to Europe in the 10th century via the Islamic cultural wave. Arab travellers report evidence that the Slavs used the &quot;gusle&quot; in the 10th century. Teodosije the Hilandarian (1246–1328) wrote that Stefan Nemanjić (r. 1196–1228) often entertained the Serbian nobility with musicians with drums and &quot;gusle&quot;. Reliable written records about the &quot;gusle&quot; appear only in the 15th century. 16th-century travel memoirs mention the instrument in Bosnia and Serbia. In the 19th- and 20th century the instrument is mentioned in Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Albania where it is called Lahuta.

==Construction and use==

The gusle consists of a wooden sound box, the maple being considered as the best material (therefore often the instrument is referred to as &quot;gusle javorove&quot; - maple gusle), covered with an animal skin and a neck with an intricately carved head. A bow is pulled over the string/s (made of horsetail), creating a dramatic and sharp sound, expressive and difficult to master. The string is made of thirty horsehairs.

The instrument is held vertically between the player&#x27;s knees, with the left hand fingers on the neck. The strings are never pressed to the neck, giving a harmonic and unique sound. The most common and traditional version is single-stringed, while a much less-common version is the two-stringed found in Bosanska Krajina and in Lika.

The varieties of the guslar music are based on cultural basis; the content of the stories of each ethnic group is different, as different epic poems are used to accompany the instrument. There is minor differing characteristics of vocality in the regions of Southeast Europe. The design of the instrument is identical; only the design of the neck and head varies with ethnic or national motif.

The &quot;gusle&quot; instrumentally accompanies heroic songs (epic poetry) in the Balkans.

===Serbs===

The Serbian Gusle is a one-stringed instrument that is usually made of maple wood. A &quot;guslar&quot; is an individual capable of reproducing and composing poems about heroes and historical events to the accompaniment of this instrument, usually in the decasyllable meter. There are records of an instrument named &quot;gusle&quot; (гоусли) being played at the court of the 13th-century Serbian King Stefan Nemanjić, but it is not certain whether the term was used in its present-day meaning or it denoted some other kind of string instrument. Polish poets of the 17th century mentioned the gusle in their works. In a poem published in 1612, Kasper Miaskowski wrote that &quot;the Serbian gusle and gaidas will overwhelm Shrove Tuesday&quot; (&quot;Serbskie skrzypki i dudy ostatek zagluszą&quot;). In the idyll named &quot;Śpiewacy&quot;, published in 1663, Józef Bartłomiej Zimorowic used the phrase &quot;to sing to the Serbian gusle&quot; (&quot;przy Serbskich gęślach śpiewać&quot;). In some older Serbian books on literature it was stated that a Serbian &quot;guslar&quot; performed at the court of Władysław II Jagiełło in 1415. The earliest known Serbian guslar is referred to in 1551 by Hungarian historian Sebastian Tinody, saying, &quot;There are many gusle players here in Hungary, but none is better at the Serbian style than Dimitrije Karaman&quot;. In addition Sebastian describes the performance, explaining that the &quot;guslar&quot; would hold the &quot;gusle&quot; between the knees and goes into a highly emotional artistic performance with a sad and dedicated expression on their face.

The &quot;gusle&quot; has played a significant role in the history of Serbian epic poetry because of its association with the centuries-old patriotic oral legacy. Most of the epics are about the era of the Ottoman occupation and the struggle for the liberation from it. With the efforts of ethnographer Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, many of these epics have been collected and published in books in the first half of the 19th century. Serbian folk poetry was given a marvelous reception, as it appeared in Europe when Romanticism was in full bloom. This poetry, which appeared in Karadžić&#x27;s anthological collections, met the &quot;expectations&quot; of the sophisticated European audience, becoming a living confirmation of Herder&#x27;s and Grimm&#x27;s ideas about the oral tradition. Jacob Grimm began to learn Serbian so that he could read the poems in the original. He wrote minute analyses of each new volume of Serbian folk songs. He ranked them as being equal to the Song of Songs, as did Goethe somewhat later. Thanks to Grimm, moreover to the initiatives of Slovene Jernej Kopitar (the censor for Slavonic books in Vienna, Karadžić&#x27;s counselor and protector), Serbian folk literature found its place in the literature of the world.
Vuk Karadžić divided the epic songs he collected from guslars like Filip Višnjić and Tešan Podrugović into three cycles.

The first cycle includes songs from the earliest era of the medieval Serbian state and the era of the Serbian Empire. Some of the most well-known poems from this cycle include &quot;The Wedding of Emperor Dušan&quot; (&quot;Ženidba cara Dušana&quot;), &quot;The Buliding of Skadar&quot; (&quot;Ženidba Dušanova&quot;) and &quot;Uroš and Mrnjavčevići&quot; (&quot;Uroš i Mrnjavčevići&quot;) 

The next cycle includes songs about the Battle of Kosovo (1389) and the events related to it. The most famous song is the &quot;Prince&#x27;s Curse&quot; (&quot;Kneževa kletva&quot;), in which Miloš Obilić and Prince Lazar are main characters. The Kosovo Battle is probably the most important event in Serbian epic poetry. Singing songs about the Battle of Kosovo to gusle significantly influenced the birth of the Kosovo Myth.

The last cycle includes songs about the events after the Battle of Kosovo. They sing about the first battles against the Ottomans and conflicts between Serbian nobles. A famous poem from that era is the poem about Strahinja Banović. The greatest hero of this cycle is Marko Kraljević. Poems about the chivalry of hajduks and uskos who resisted the Ottomans also belong to that cycle. Some of them are Starina Novak, Stanoje Glavaš, Starac Vujadin, Janković Stojan, Ilija Smiljanić, Bajo Pivljanin and Hajduk Veljko. Battles between Montenegrins and the Ottomans (Battle of Vučij Do, Battle of Grahovo, Battle of Fundina) were also sung, as well as the Serbian Revolution and its heroes: Karađorđe, Hajduk Veljko, Aleksa Nenadović, Ilija Birčanin, Tanasko Rajić, Vasa Čarapić and Miloš Obrenović.

More recent poems sing about recent battles and wars for the liberation of Serbia and Montenegro, such as the Serbian-Ottoman Wars of 1876-1878, the Herzegovina Uprising, the Liberation Wars of 1912-1913, the Siege of Skadar, the First World War, and the Battle of Mojkovac. One of the participants in the Battle of Mojkovac, Radovan Bećirović Trebješki, will become the most famous modern writer of Serbian epic poems.

Although the gusle was played throughout the entire territory of the former Serbian Empire, and later in the areas to the north and west - in Vojvodina and in the Military Frontier, the tradition of playing gusle is strongest today in Herzegovina and Montenegro, where Serbian medieval culture has been best preserved. That is why gusle today are mostly decorated with details that remind of the heroic past of these areas. Many gusle are decorated with carved motifs depicting scenes from battles (Battle of Vučji Do, Nevesinjska Puška), characters of famous Serbs (Saint Sava, Petar Petrović Njegoš, Karađorđe, King Nikola) or famous places (Ostrog Monastery, Cetinje Monastery and Lovćen Chapel).

In all major cities, such as Belgrade, Podgorica, East Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Cetinje, Pljevlja, Užice, Novi Sad, Niš, Nikšić and Kraljevo, there are guslar societies that organize concerts and gusle evenings (&quot;guslarske večeri&quot;). Guslar Society &quot;Vuk Karadžić&quot; is the oldest existing guslar society in Belgrade. The societies are organized into three guslar federations - in Serbia, Montenegro and the Republic of Srpska. Gusle competitions called festivals are organized regularly. There are numerous youth competitions and festivals for seniors, but the biggest competition being the Federal Festival of Gusle (&quot;Савезни фестивал гусала&quot;/&quot;Savezni festival gusala&quot;).Competitors are the highest-ranked guslars at festivals in Serbia, Montenegro and Republika Srpska. The champion is considered the best Serbian guslar that year. Most famous modern Serbian guslars are Branko Perović, Boško Vujačić, Đorđije Đoko Koprivica, Milomir Miljanić Miljan, Saša Laketić and Maksim Vojvodić.

Singing to the accompaniment of the &quot;gusle&quot; as a part of Serbia&#x27;s tradition was inscribed in 2018 on the Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists of UNESCO after years of Serbian guslars&#x27; efforts.

=== Bosniaks ===
There are few active Bosniak Guslari today, but there were many examples in history. Guslari were always guests at the Bosniak beg&#x27;s courtyards, and it was with Gusle they performed Bosniak heroic songs about prominent figures or events. In these songs were Đerzelez Alija, Mujo Hrnjica, Mustay-Bey of Lika The Battle of Banja Luka or the Battle at Očakov.

Avdo Međedović was the most versatile and skillful guslar encountered by Milman Parry and Albert Lord during their research in the oral epic tradition of Bosnia, Herzegovina and Montenegro in the 1930s. At Parry&#x27;s request, Avdo sang songs he already knew and some songs he heard in front of Parry, convincing him that someone Homer-like could produce a poem so long. Avdo dictated, over five days, a version of the well-known theme &quot;The Wedding of Meho Smailagić&quot; that was 12,323 lines long, saying on the fifth day to Nikola (Parry&#x27;s assistant on the journey) that he knew even longer songs. On another occasion, he sang over several days an epic of 13,331 lines. He said he had several others of similar length in his repertoire. In Parry&#x27;s first tour, over 80,000 lines were transcribed.

===Albania &amp; Kosovo===

The lahuta is used by Gheg Albanians of northernmost Albania (Malësia) and Kosovo, for the singing of epic songs or Albanian Songs of the Frontier Warriors. The instrument was very common in Kosovo and Albania, specially in the mountain regions such as Malsia. In Albanian types, the lutes head is often carved after a goats head or a hawk, the latter representing the Albanian flag.

It is played by a &quot;lahutar&quot;, a rapsode. The Albanian songs are octosyllable, in relation to the decasyllable Serbian.

The use of lahuta is traditionally mastered in the Highlands and Malësi e Madhe District.
Gjergj Fishta, the Albanian national poet and priest, wrote the book &quot;Lahuta e Malcis&quot; which is often played with a lahuta. The famous Albanian song about Gjergj Elez Alia, the Albanian mythological hero who slays a beast that rises from the sea, is also played with a lahuta.
===Croatia===

The gusle has been used by the Croats in Herzegovina, Dalmatia, Lika, as well as in Bosnia and Western Bosnia as an accompaniment for epic poetry for hundreds of years. Often they were constructed by the singers and players themselves, shepherds or even by specialized gusle builders from urban areas. Most lyrics center around historical figures who played an important role in Croatian history (often folk heroes who died tragic deaths, such as hajduks) or significant historical events (mostly battles against invaders or occupying powers).

Perhaps the most famous Croatian guslar poets was Andrija Kačić Miošić, an 18th-century monk who created and collected many gusle lyrics and songs throughout the regions, which are still sung today. Croatia&#x27;s most famous contemporary guslar is Mile Krajina.
Although gusle are not a part of mainstream popular music, the instrument has been included into songs by some musicians such as Marko Perković Thompson, Mate Bulić and Dario Plevnik. Gusle recordings can be heard on a number of CD compilations published by Croatian ethnologists, which are in most cases distributed locally by the artists themselves.

==Etymology==
The Old Slavic root morpheme gǫdsli (Russian &quot;gúsli&quot;, slovak &quot;husle&quot;, Czech &quot;housle&quot;, Slovenian &quot;gósli&quot;) is associated with guditi/gósti, or gudalo/godalo, related to onomatopoeia for a low resonating sound; cf. &quot;gu(n)delj&quot;/&quot;гу(н)дељ&quot; = cockchafer, which makes such sound when flying.

The exact origin of the nominations of the related concepts gusle, gadulka, gudok and gudalo, the latter as the name for the bow of the gusle could also illuminate a more accurate assignment in the history of the Gusle after Walther Wünsch.

In the parlance of the South Slavs, in addition to the feminine plurale tantum &quot;gusle&quot; that has prevailed as a lexeme, even the older &quot;gusli&quot;, which is found in the area of the middle Drina River region to Arilje and throughout Montenegro. The use of the phonemes and is in the same language as the same speaker, or it can be used in lyrics or everyday speech.

The singular form &quot;gusla&quot; is found only in Eastern Serbia, west of the Timok, around Niš, Ivanjica, as well as in the area of the Zlatibor. On Korčula only &quot;gusla&quot; is in use.

The term &quot;gusle&quot; by Alberto Fortis has been introduced into European literature. &quot;Gusle&quot; is in Serbian linguistic usage, however, a feminine plurale tantum (Serbo-Croatian &quot;gusla&quot; or &quot;gusle&quot;, Albanian &quot;lahuta&quot; or &quot;lahutë&quot;).

<text>Warzone (formerly known as Rat Poison) was an American hardcore punk band formed on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1983. The band helped develop the New York hardcore sound, the hardcore skinhead style and the youth crew subgenre. During the band&#x27;s 14 years and many line-up changes, their primarily hardcore sound was flavored by influences ranging from Oi! (they toured several times with The Business and played a cover of their song &quot;The Real Enemy&quot;) to traditional punk rock to heavy metal (on their self-titled LP). Their fan base was diverse, with their concerts usually attended by skinheads, straight edge teens, metalheads, and punks of all ages. &quot;Vice&quot; has written that &quot;one could argue that [Warzone] spearheaded the second and larger wave of hardcore bands that erupted in the NY scene in 1986–1987&quot;.

Frontman Raymond &quot;Raybeez&quot; Barbieri was the band&#x27;s only consistent member through the vast majority of its years. He joined the band as the drummer in 1983 (the same year he played drums on the debut Agnostic Front 7-inch EP &quot;United Blood&quot;), later taking over vocal duties after Warzone had already been in existence for two years (noting later, &quot;in a band that [had] been running for so long, there has to be something there&quot;). Raybeez remained the singer of Warzone until his death on September 11, 1997, due to pneumonia. A U.S. Navy veteran, he was receiving treatment in a VHA facility when the illness damaged his liver and took his life at the age of 35. A tribute sign reading &quot;R.I.P Ray&quot; hung outside CBGB for some time following his death, and for more than a year afterward, every release on Victory Records was dedicated to his memory, as were two independent compilations. These albums, as well as benefit concerts, raised funds for several non-profit groups Ray had worked for which helped at-risk youth.

On January 22, 2025, former Cro-Mags lead singer John Joseph posted to Instagram, accusing Raybeez of having groomed teenagers in the hardcore scene and plying them with drugs, also implicating this behaviour in the heroin addiction and later suicide of Todd Youth.

However, friends of Raybeez such as Wendy Guillotine, Jimmy Gestapo and Roger Miret have all come out in defense of Raybeez.

<text>The Kinsky Horse is a Czech breed of warmblood sport horse. It was bred by the Kinsky family in the Kingdom of Bohemia, and is now one of four warmblood sport horse breeds reared in the Czech Republic, the others being the Czech Warmblood, the Slovakian Warmblood and the Moravian Warmblood. It was for many years absorbed into the Czech Warmblood; a separate stud-book was established in 2005. It is characterised by an unusual golden-yellow coat, though other colours are also seen.

== History ==

The Kinsky Horse was bred in the nineteenth century by members of the Kinsky family in the Kingdom of Bohemia, and was sometimes known as the Golden Horse of Bohemia. In the twentieth century it was largely absorbed into the Czech Warmblood. A separate stud-book for the breed was established in 2005.

Its conservation status was not listed by the FAO in 2007. In 2018 the population reported to DAD-IS was about 600 head, and the conservation status in 2020 was reported as &quot;at risk&quot;.

== Characteristics ==

The horses usually stand between at the withers. Many have a coat of a characteristic golden-yellow colour, but others may be bay, chestnut or occasionally black.

<doc id="446133" wikidata="Q921167" url="?curid=446133" title="Yuri Kondratyuk">
<text>Yuri Vasilyevich Kondratyuk (; ), real name Aleksandr Ignatyevich Shargei (; ; 21 June 1897 – February 1942), was a Soviet engineer and mathematician. He was a pioneer of astronautics and spaceflight, a theoretician and a visionary who, in the early 20th century, developed the first known lunar orbit rendezvous (LOR), a key concept for landing and return spaceflight from Earth to the Moon. The LOR was later used for the plotting of the first actual human spaceflight to the Moon. Many other aspects of spaceflight and space exploration are covered in his works.

Kondratyuk made his scientific discoveries in circumstances of war (including both World Wars and the Russian Civil War), continuous persecutions from authorities and serious illnesses. In fact, &quot;Yuri Kondratyuk&quot;, the name under which he became known both in Russia and abroad, was a stolen identity he assumed in 1921 for his own protection.

==Biography and research==
===Early life===
Kondratyuk was born as Aleksandr Ignatyevich Shargei in 1897 in Poltava, Russian Empire (now Ukraine), although his family originally lived in Kiev. His father, Ignat Benediktovich Shargei, was a Jewish convert to Catholicism who studied physics and mathematics at St. Vladimir Imperial University of Kiev at the time of his marriage. Kondratyuk&#x27;s mother, Lyudmila Lvovna Schlippenbach, of the Schlippenbach noble family, taught French at a Kiev school, and must have already been pregnant when she married in January 1897. She is a direct descendant of Wolmar Anton von Schlippenbach, a general who took part in Charles XII of Sweden&#x27;s failed invasion of Russia. Her grandfather Anton von Schlippenbach was lieutenant colonel of the Imperial Russian Army and participated in the Napoleonic Wars. Aleksandr lived mostly with his grandmother and her husband in Poltava.

From an early age, Kondratyuk demonstrated great abilities in physics and mathematics. When he was old enough to attend high school, he was admitted straight into the third form of a prestigious high school, where he graduated with a gold medal for proficiency a few years later.

===Higher education and World War I===
Kondratyuk later enrolled at the Peter the Great Petrograd Imperial Polytechnic Institute to study engineering, where he was influenced by Ivan Meshcherskiy. Soon, however, he was drafted to serve in World War I, and was sent to ensign training at one of the local Petrograd junker schools. During his military service on the Caucasian Front, Kondratyuk filled four notebooks with his ideas of interplanetary flight. These included suggesting the use of a modular spacecraft to reach the Moon, leaving the propulsion section of the vehicle on orbit while a smaller lander journeyed to the surface and back (the strategy eventually adopted by the engineers of the Apollo program). He included detailed calculations of the trajectory to take a spacecraft from Earth orbit to lunar orbit and back to Earth orbit, a trajectory now known as &quot;Kondratyuk&#x27;s route&quot; or &quot;Kondratyuk&#x27;s loop&quot;.

===First Soviet years===
Kondratyuk left the army in 1917 following the Russian Revolution and tried to make a living stoking boilers back in Poltava. Being a former officer of the Tsarist army, he was once again mobilised in 1919 to join the White Army. Not wishing to participate in the civil war, he deserted during the journey from Kiev to Odessa, losing all his documents in the process. A deserter to the Whites, he was also at high risk of arrest by Bolshevik authorities as a former tsarist officer.

In 1920 Kondratyuk made an attempt to escape for Poland but was stopped and turned back by border guards. In the meantime, his stepmother obtained the documents of a certain Yuri Vasilyevich Kondratyuk, born in Lutsk in 1900 and recently deceased of tuberculosis. Under this new identity, Kondratyuk lived in and around Kuban and the North Caucasus, working as a mechanic and railroad worker. He settled in Novosibirsk in Siberia in 1927.

===First book, engineering work and imprisonment===
Working as a mechanic, Kondratyuk completed the manuscript of a book titled &quot;The Conquest of Interplanetary Spaces&quot;, dealing with rocket motion and issues concerning the colonization of space. He also suggested using a gravitational slingshot trajectory to accelerate a spacecraft. In 1925, Kondratyuk made contact with Moscow-based scientist Vladimir Vetchinkin and sent him the manuscript. Up to that time, he and his work were unknown to rocketry enthusiasts. While the book was enthusiastically received by scientists in Moscow, no publisher would touch such a fanciful work. Eventually, Kondratyuk paid a Novosibirsk printing shop to produce 2,000 copies of the 72-page work, and even then had to do much of the typesetting and operating the press himself, both to save costs but also because the equations in the book posed problems for the printer. Kondratyuk&#x27;s discoveries were made independently of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky who also worked on spaceflight issues at that time; the two never met.

Applying his engineering skill to local problems, Kondratyuk designed a huge 13,000 ton grain elevator (quickly nicknamed &quot;Mastodon&quot;) in Kamen-na-Obi, built of wood without a single nail, since metal was in short supply in Siberia. This ingenuity would work against him when in 1930 he was investigated as a &quot;saboteur&quot; by the NKVD. The lack of nails in the structure was used as evidence that he had planned it to collapse. Convicted of &quot;anti-Soviet activity&quot;, Kondratyuk was sentenced to three years in a gulag, but because of his evident talents was sent to a &quot;sharashka&quot; (research facility prison) rather than a labour camp. There, he was first put to work evaluating foreign coal mining machinery for the use in Kuzbass, and quickly impressed the camp supervisor with his ingenuity. At the supervisor&#x27;s request, in November 1931 a review board changed Kondratyuk&#x27;s status from &quot;prisoner&quot; to &quot;exiled&quot;, and sent him to work on Siberian grain projects. There he even managed to get a patent and author&#x27;s certificate in the field of mining equipment.

===Post-imprisonment research on wind power===

Kondratyuk learned of a competition to design a large wind power generator for Crimea, sponsored by Sergo Ordzhonikidze, then People&#x27;s Commissar of Heavy Industry. With fellow exiled engineers Pyotr Gorchakov and Nikolai Nikitin, Kondratyuk submitted a design for a 165-metre (500 ft) high concrete tower supporting a four-bladed propeller with a span of 80 metres (240 ft) and capable of generating up to 12,000 kW. In November 1932, Ordzhonikidze selected this design as the winner and invited the team to meet with him in Moscow before sending them to Kharkov to finalise the design and supervise its construction. While in Moscow, Kondratyuk had the opportunity to meet Sergei Korolev, then head of the Group for the Study of Reactive Motion (GIRD), the Soviet rocket research group). Korolev offered Kondratyuk a position on his staff, but Kondratyuk declined, fearing that the scrutiny he would come under the NKVD would reveal his true identity.

Kondratyuk, Gorchakov, and Nikitin worked on the wind power project for the next four years until Ordzhonikidze&#x27;s mysterious death in 1937. Overnight, the project was deemed to be too expensive and dangerous and was shut down, the tower only half-built. Nikitin would later use what he had learned on this project when he designed the Ostankino Tower in the 1960s. Meanwhile, the men went to work on designing smaller wind turbines (in the 150-200 kW range) to power farms. During this time, Kondratyuk learned of the arrest of Korolev on charges of treason for wasting time on designing spacecraft. 

He immediately decided to divest himself of his own copious notes on the subject. The former neighbour in Novosibirsk who had nursed him back to health after his episode of typhus agreed to take his notebooks and eventually took these to the United States when she escaped there with her daughter following World War II. He also sent a copy of his published work to the Tsiolkovsky State Museum of the History of Cosmonautics in Kaluga.

===World War II fighting and death===
Kondratyuk joined the Red Army as a volunteer in June 1941 and died in 1942 near Kaluga. The exact circumstances of his death are not known. His unit was involved in heavy fighting against the Nazis in October 1941, and 3 October is sometimes given as the date of his demise. Evidence collected in the 1990s suggests that he disappeared in January or February 1942 while repairing a communications cable at night near Zasetsky, a village in the Kirovsky District of the Kaluga region.

==Remembrance and tributes==

When American astronaut Neil Armstrong visited the Soviet Union after his historic flight to the Moon, he collected a handful of soil from outside Kondratyuk&#x27;s house in Novosibirsk to acknowledge his contribution to spaceflight, reportedly urging Soviet authorities to start commemorating Kondratyuk.

Later, a science centre and college in Novosibirsk was named after Kondratyuk, as well as streets in Poltava, Kyiv, and Moscow. The Poltava National Technical University has borne Kondratyuk&#x27;s name since 1997. Additionally, Kondratyuk was the namesake of the Kondratyuk crater on the Moon and the 3084 Kondratyuk minor planet discovered in 1977.

The Government of Ukraine has issued postage stamps and coins featuring Kondratyuk.

Yuri Kondratyuk was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 2014.

Kadratyuk&#x27;s story and contributions to spaceflight were highlighted in the eighth episode of the 2020 American science documentary TV series &quot;&quot;, titled &quot;The Sacrifice of Cassini&quot;.

<doc id="446134" wikidata="Q181861" url="?curid=446134" title="Noise rock">
<text>Noise rock (sometimes called noise punk) is a noise-oriented style of experimental rock that spun off from punk rock in the 1980s. Drawing on movements such as minimalism, industrial music, and New York hardcore, artists indulge in extreme levels of distortion through the use of electric guitars and, less frequently, electronic instrumentation, either to provide percussive sounds or to contribute to the overall arrangement.

Some groups are tied to song structures, such as Sonic Youth. Although they are not representative of the entire genre, they helped popularize noise rock among alternative rock audiences by incorporating melodies into their droning textures of sound, which set a template that numerous other groups followed. Other early noise rock bands were Big Black, Swans and the Jesus Lizard.

== Characteristics ==
Noise rock fuses rock to noise, usually with recognizable &quot;rock&quot; instrumentation, but with greater use of distortion and electronic effects, varying degrees of atonality, improvisation, and white noise. One notable band of this genre is Sonic Youth, who took inspiration from the no wave composers Glenn Branca and Rhys Chatham. Sonic Youth&#x27;s Thurston Moore has stated: &quot;Noise has taken the place of punk rock. People who play noise have no real aspirations to being part of the mainstream culture. Punk has been co-opted, and this subterranean noise music and the avant-garde folk scene have replaced it.&quot;

==History==

===Forerunners===

While the music had been around for some time, the term &quot;noise rock&quot; was coined in the 1980s to describe an offshoot of punk groups with an increasingly abrasive approach. An archetypal album is the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; (1968). &quot;Treblezine&quot;″s Joe Gross credits &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; as the &quot;cult classic&quot; with being the first noise rock album, accordingly, &quot;perhaps it&#x27;s an obvious starting point, but it&#x27;s also the starting point. Period.&quot; Influenced by the free jazz of Ornette Coleman Reed stated that:

Les Rallizes Denudés quickly adopted the noise elements developed by the Velvet Underground in &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; and &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; by creating long improvisational songs based on feedback and the use of heavy distortion. The band moved toward an increasingly noise based sound in the 1970s, influencing a great number of artists in the Japanese noise and psychedelic rock scene.

The 1960s groups Red Krayola, Cromagnon, and Nihilist Spasm Band are other bands that were later assessed by some music critics and journalists to be early pioneers of what would become noise rock.

===Origins===
Guitarist Steve Albini of noise rock band Big Black stated in 1984 in an article that &quot;good noise is like orgasm&quot;. He commented: &quot;Anybody can play notes. There&#x27;s no trick. What is a trick and a good one is to make a guitar do things that don&#x27;t sound like a guitar at all. The point here is stretching the boundaries.&quot; He said that Ron Asheton of the Stooges &quot;made squealy death noise feedback&quot; on &quot;Iggy&#x27;s monstruous songs&quot;. Albini also mentioned John McKay of Siouxsie and the Banshees, saying: &quot;&quot;The Scream&quot; is notable for a couple of things: only now people are trying to copy it, and even now nobody understands how that guitar player got all that pointless noise to stick together as songs&quot;. Albini also said that Keith Levene of Public Image Ltd had this &quot;ability to make an excruciating noise come out of his guitar&quot;.

In an article about noise rock, &quot;Spin&quot; wrote that a US compilation album titled &quot;No New York&quot;, released in 1978 on an independent label called &quot;Antilles&quot;, was important as it documented the no wave New York scene. It featured several songs of Lydia Lunch&#x27;s first band Teenage Jesus and the Jerks along with material of other groups Mars, DNA and James Chance and the Contortions.

===Music===
In the 1980s, Big Black, Sonic Youth and Swans were the leading figures of noise rock. Sonic Youth were the first noise rock band to get signed by a major label in 1990. The Jesus Lizard emerged in the early 1990s as a &quot;leading noise rock band&quot; in the American scene with their &quot;willfully abrasive and atonal&quot; style. Later notable bands of the noise scene were Liars, Season to Risk and Unsane.

While noise rock has never had any mainstream popularity, the raw, distorted and feedback-intensive sound of some noise rock bands had an influence on shoegaze, which enjoyed some popularity in the 90s, especially in the UK, and grunge, the most commercially successful. Among them are Wisconsin&#x27;s Killdozer, Chicago&#x27;s Big Black, and most notably San Francisco&#x27;s Flipper, a band known for its slowed-down and murky &quot;noise punk&quot;. The Butthole Surfers&#x27; mix of punk, heavy metal and noise rock was a major influence, particularly on the early work of Soundgarden.

Starting in the 1990s, noise punk developed mostly as a form of party music, with the band Lightning Bolt serving as key players in the 2000s noise punk scene in Providence, Rhode Island, although Brian Gibson, the band&#x27;s bassist, is dismissive of the noise punk label, stating &quot;I hate, hate, hate the category &quot;noise-punk&quot; I really don&#x27;t like being labeled with two words that have so much baggage. It&#x27;s gross.&quot;

<text>Dog sports are competitive activities specifically designed for dogs. Dogs typically participate in sports with the help of owners, although some dog sports do not require human participation. A 2015 survey found that dog owners of all classes participate in dog sports, with owners from large cities (over 500,000 people), medium cities (between 100,000 and 500,000 people), small cities (less than 100,000 people), and rural areas each accounting for roughly the same percentage of dog sport competitors. 

According to the survey, the most popular dog sports are obedience sports, and the majority of people that compete in dog sports compete in over twelve dog sporting events per year. Additionally, the majority of owners that compete in dog sports are primarily motivated by internal motivators (such as satisfaction or improving their relationships with their dogs) rather than external motivators (such as prizes).

<doc id="446142" wikidata="Q1262954" url="?curid=446142" title="Dubai World Cup">
<text>The Dubai World Cup (Arabic: كأس دبي العالمي) is a Thoroughbred horse race held annually since 1996 and contested at the Meydan Racecourse (Arabic: ميدان) which in Arabic suggests a place where people congregate and compete, a sort of meeting point in the Emirate of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The race is operated through the Emirates Racing Authority (ERA) whose Chairman is Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Presidential Affairs of the United Arab Emirates. It offers nine races, consisting of eight Thoroughbred contests and one Purebred Arabian contest.

The Dubai World Cup was created in 1996 by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai who owns Darley Stud &amp; Godolphin Racing, one of the world&#x27;s leading Thoroughbred breeding and racing operations.

It is held on the last Saturday in March as the final race of the Dubai World Cup Night. It is a Group 1 flat race on dirt over a distance of 2,000 metres (about 10 furlongs). It is open for Northern Hemisphere Thoroughbred four-year-olds &amp; up and for Southern Hemisphere Thoroughbred three-year-olds &amp; up. Since its 2019 running, the race has carried a purse of $12 million, regaining its place as the world&#x27;s richest horse race, a record held by the Pegasus World Cup in 2017 and 2018. It was held at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse before 2009. In 2010, the Dubai World Cup was first held at the new Meydan Racecourse on March 27, on all-weather surface known as Tapeta. However, it was held as dirt race again in 2015 due to the high maintenance cost and being an unpopular condition among American participants.

The race&#x27;s first winner was the future United States Hall of Fame Thoroughbred Cigar, owned by Allen E. Paulson. A plaque honoring that horse hangs outside the barn of Bill Mott at Belmont Park.

In 2006 the Dubai World Cup was broadcast live on TVG Network and HRTV and taped later for showing on ABC. It was the first time that the race was shown on national TV in the United States.
The 2020 event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="446144" wikidata="Q51139" url="?curid=446144" title="Alvin Stardust">
<text>Bernard William Jewry (27 September 1942 – 23 October 2014), known professionally as Shane Fenton and later as Alvin Stardust, was an English rock singer and stage actor. Performing first as Shane Fenton in the 1960s, Jewry had a moderately successful career in the pre-Beatles era, hitting the UK top 40 with four singles in 1961–62. However, he became better known for singles released in the 1970s and 1980s as Alvin Stardust, a character he began in the glam rock era, with hits including the UK Singles Chart-topper &quot;Jealous Mind&quot;, as well as later hits such as &quot;Pretend&quot; and &quot;I Feel Like Buddy Holly&quot;.

== Early life and career ==
Bernard William Jewry was born 27 September 1942 in Muswell Hill, then in Middlesex (now in the London Borough of Haringey). Having moved at a young age to Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, where his mother ran a boarding house frequented by musicians and entertainers appearing locally, Jewry attended the Southwell Minster Collegiate Grammar School (now Southwell Minster School) in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, near Newark-on-Trent, as a boarder. He made his stage debut in pantomime at the age of four.

== Personae ==
=== Shane Fenton ===
In the early 1960s, Shane Fenton and the Fentones were an unknown teenage band who recorded a demo tape and mailed it in to a BBC programme with the hope of being picked to appear on television. While awaiting a reply from the BBC, the band&#x27;s 17-year-old singer Shane Fenton (whose real name was Johnny Theakston) died as a result of the rheumatic fever he had suffered in childhood.

The rest of the band (guitarists Jerry Wilcock and Mick Eyre, bassist Graham George Squires and drummer Tony Hinchcliffe) decided to break up, but then unexpectedly received a letter from the BBC inviting them to come to London to audition in person for the programme. Theakston&#x27;s mother asked the band to stay together, and to keep its name, in honour of her son&#x27;s memory. Jewry, who was a roadie with them at the time, was asked to join the band and to use Shane Fenton as a pseudonym. The combo had a few hits in the UK Singles Chart: &quot;I&#x27;m A Moody Guy&quot;, &quot;Walk Away&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now&quot; and their biggest hit, &quot;Cindy&#x27;s Birthday&quot;. These and their subsequent misses were all on Parlophone Records.

Jewry later also appeared in Billy Fury&#x27;s movie &quot;Play It Cool&quot; (1962) and the Tommy Steele film &quot;It&#x27;s All Happening&quot; (1963). He was managed by Larry Parnes.

=== Alvin Stardust ===
Jewry disappeared from the spotlight for a decade after the break-up of the Fentones, working in music management and performing at small venues with his first wife Iris Caldwell, the sister of Rory Storm. During the early 1970s, however, he acquired a new persona, Alvin Stardust, cashing in on the glam rock bandwagon. Alvin Stardust was clearly a reference to Ziggy Stardust, a David Bowie character based on the rocker Vince Taylor. His new name was given to him by Peter Shelley, the co-founder (with Michael Levy) of Magnet Records. Shelley originated the persona of Alvin Stardust, writing, recording and singing the first Stardust single, &quot;My Coo Ca Choo&quot;, in 1973.

Shelley had originally appeared on &quot;Lift Off with Ayshea&quot; in 1973 as Alvin Stardust, dressed up in a clown costume. Shelley, however, had no interest in performing live or making public appearances, so even as &quot;My Coo Ca Choo&quot; was climbing the charts, he was on the lookout for someone to take over the role of Alvin Stardust. Hal Carter, Jewry&#x27;s manager, suggested his client as a substitute. Jewry took over as Stardust in time to lip-synch &quot;My Coo Ca Choo&quot; on its first &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearance. The new Alvin Stardust character look had sideburns and a black leather outfit. 

All further Alvin Stardust records were sung by Jewry. Stardust had further chart successes with the hits &quot;Jealous Mind&quot; (UK No. 1), &quot;You, You, You&quot;, &quot;Red Dress&quot; and &quot;Good Love Can Never Die&quot;. In total, he amassed seven Top Ten entries, in a chart span lasting almost 25 years.

Stardust was part of the Green Cross Code road safety campaign &quot;Children&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (1976), which saw him instructing children to look both ways before they crossed the road.

&quot;Pretend&quot; was a hit in the United Kingdom in 1981, reaching number four in the UK Singles Chart. It reached number one in the Dutch Top 40 in November 1981. The song was also successful in Portugal in 1983.

Alvin Stardust was a guest act on the &quot;Morecambe &amp; Wise Christmas Show&quot; in 1981.

The singles &quot;I Feel Like Buddy Holly&quot; (written and produced by Mike Batt) and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Run Away&quot; reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart in 1984. &quot;So Near To Christmas&quot; was a minor hit, No. 29, in the same year.

He participated in &quot;&quot;, the UK qualifying heat of the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&quot;, in 1985, with the song &quot;The Clock on the Wall&quot;. He finished in third place behind Vikki and Kerri Wells.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1985 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

In 1986, Stardust performed the duet &quot;I Hope and I Pray&quot; with Sheila Walsh on her album &quot;Shadowlands&quot;, which was released as a single. That year he also performed at Windsor Castle as a lead in the Lloyd Webber–Rice musical &quot;Cricket&quot;.

Stardust also starred in the UK tour of &quot;Godspell&quot; and played Uriah Heep in &quot;David Copperfield – The Musical&quot; and Sir Billy Butlin in &quot;The Butlin Story&quot; at the London Palladium. In 2005 he starred as the Child Catcher in &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, also at the London Palladium.

Stardust made numerous television appearances, and continued to tour as a performer and singer. In 1989, he also hosted his own Sunday morning children&#x27;s TV series on ITV called &quot;It&#x27;s Stardust&quot;. It featured stories, songs, poems, jokes and also cartoons and shows for younger children, including &quot;The Adventures of Parsley&quot;, &quot;Little Miss&quot; and &quot;Satellite City&quot;.

In 1995, he joined the cast of the soap opera, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, playing the character Greg Andersen from October 1995 to July 1996.

On 2 October 2011, Stardust was initiated into the Grand Order of Water Rats, an entertainment fraternity.

In 2011, Stardust made a return to the stage as a singer rather than an actor, and played the Arts Guild Theatre in Greenock on 28 October 2011.

== Personal life ==
Stardust was married three times. In Liverpool in 1964 as Bernard W. Jewry he married Iris Caldwell, sister of Rory Storm and an ex-girlfriend of both George Harrison and Paul McCartney, having grown up with them in Liverpool. In 1981, Stardust married the actress Liza Goddard, again under the name of Bernard W. Jewry. Their daughter, Sophie Jewry, was critically injured at the age of two months after she fell down a set of stairs and suffered a severe fracture of the skull; she later recovered from her injuries. Stardust was married to the actress and choreographer Julie Paton at the time of his death.

He had two sons and two daughters, the youngest of whom had Cliff Richard as one of her godparents.

His eldest son, Shaun Fenton, was born in 1969. His birth was registered in December 1969 under the name of Fenton. The other son is the drum and bass producer Adam F. Shaun Fenton was educated at Haberdashers’ Aske’s School and Keble College in Oxford, where he obtained an MA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. He was headteacher for Sir John Lawes School and Pate&#x27;s Grammar School, and has been headteacher for Reigate Grammar School since September 2012. He was appointed OBE in 2020 for his services to Education.

Stardust converted to Christianity in the late 1980s after meeting a group of American Baptist missionaries on a train.

== Death ==
Stardust died at home after a brief illness; this was confirmed by his manager on 23 October 2014. He was 72 years old. His funeral was held in St Thomas Church, Swansea, where he had married Julie Paton. His death came weeks before he was due to release his first album in 30 years, and six days after what became his last show at the Regal Cinema, Evesham. He had been diagnosed with prostate cancer 18 months earlier, which later metastasised. He was cremated in Morriston Crematorium and his ashes scattered in the grounds.

<text>Juniperus communis, the common juniper, is a species of small tree or shrub in the cypress family Cupressaceae. An evergreen conifer, it has the largest geographical range of any woody plant, with a circumpolar distribution throughout the cool temperate Northern Hemisphere.

==Description==
&quot;Juniperus communis&quot; is highly variable in form, ranging from —rarely —tall to a low, often prostrate spreading shrub in exposed locations. It has needle-like leaves in whorls of three; the leaves are green, with a single white stomatal band on the inner surface. It never attains the scale-like adult foliage of other members of the genus. It is dioecious, with male and female cones on separate plants so requiring wind pollination to transfer pollen from male to female cones. Male trees or shrubs naturally live longer than female trees or shrubs; a male tree or shrub can live more than 2000 years.

The male cones are yellow, long, and fall soon after shedding their pollen in March–April. The fruit are berry-like cones known as juniper berries. They are initially green, ripening in 18 months to purple-black with a blue waxy coating; they are spherical, diameter, and usually have three (occasionally six) fleshy fused scales, each scale with a single seed. The seeds are dispersed when birds eat the cones, digesting the fleshy scales and passing the hard, unwinged seeds in their droppings.

=== Longevity ===
Dendrochronological studies made on shrubs from the tundra have found some particularly old specimens, which are among the oldest trees (or shrubs) ever recorded in Europe. They have found a 1647-year-old specimen in Finland (Lapland) within the Arctic Circle.

=== Chemistry ===
The juniper berry oil is composed largely of monoterpene hydrocarbons such as α-pinene, myrcene, sabinene, limonene and β-pinene.

==Subspecies==
As to be expected from its wide range, &quot;J. communis&quot; is highly variable, with several infraspecific taxa; delimitation between the taxa is still uncertain, with genetic data not matching morphological data well.
*subsp. &quot;communis&quot; – Common juniper. Usually an erect shrub or small tree; leaves long; cones small, 5–8 mm, usually shorter than the leaves; found at low to moderate altitude in temperate climates
**subsp. &quot;communis&quot; var. &quot;communis&quot; – Europe, most of northern Asia
**subsp. &quot;communis&quot; var. &quot;depressa&quot; – North America, Sierra Nevada in California
**subsp. &quot;communis&quot; var. &quot;hemisphaerica&quot; – Mediterranean mountains
**subsp. &quot;communis&quot; var. &quot;nipponica&quot; – Japan (status uncertain, often treated as &quot;J. rigida&quot; var. &quot;nipponica&quot;)
*subsp. &quot;alpina&quot; – alpine juniper (syn. &quot;J. c.&quot; subsp. &quot;nana&quot;, &quot;J. c.&quot; var. &quot;saxatilis&quot; Pallas, &quot;J. sibirica&quot; Burgsd.). Usually a prostrate ground-hugging shrub; leaves short, 3–8 mm; cones often larger, 7–12 mm, usually longer than the leaves; found in subarctic areas and high altitude alpine zones in temperate areas
**subsp. &quot;alpina&quot; var. &quot;alpina&quot; – Greenland, Europe and Asia
**subsp. &quot;alpina&quot; var. &quot;megistocarpa&quot; – Eastern Canada (doubtfully distinct from var. &quot;alpina&quot;)
**subsp. &quot;alpina&quot; var. &quot;jackii&quot; – Western North America (doubtfully distinct from var. &quot;alpina&quot;)

Some botanists treat subsp. &quot;alpina&quot; at the lower rank of variety, in which case the correct name is &quot;J. communis&quot; var. &quot;saxatilis&quot; Pallas, though the name &quot;J. communis&quot; var. &quot;montana&quot; is also occasionally cited; others, primarily in eastern Europe and Russia, sometimes treat it as a distinct species &quot;J. sibirica&quot; Burgsd. (syn. &quot;J. nana&quot; Willd., &quot;J. alpina&quot; S.F.Gray).

==Distribution and habitat==
The species has the largest geographical range of any woody plant, with a circumpolar distribution throughout the cool temperate Northern Hemisphere from the Arctic south in mountains to around 30°N latitude in North America, Europe and Asia. Relict populations can be found in the Atlas Mountains of Africa.

&quot;J. communis&quot; is one of Ireland&#x27;s longest established plants.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Juniperus communis&quot; is cultivated in the horticulture trade and used as an evergreen ornamental shrub in gardens. The following cultivars gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit in 1993:
* &quot;Juniperus communis&quot; &#x27;Compressa&#x27; 
* &quot;Juniperus communis&quot; &#x27;Green Carpet&#x27; (prostrate shrub)
* &quot;Juniperus communis&quot; &#x27;Hibernica&#x27; (Irish juniper)
* &quot;Juniperus communis&quot; &#x27;Repanda&#x27; (prostrate shrub)

Other cultivars in use include:
* &quot;Juniperus communis&quot; &#x27;Fontän&#x27;
* &quot;Juniperus communis&quot; &#x27;Green Carpet&#x27;
* &quot;Juniperus communis&quot; &#x27;Hornibrookii&#x27;
* &quot;Juniperus communis&quot; &#x27;Kantarell&#x27;
* &quot;Juniperus communis&quot; &#x27;Repanda&#x27; 
* &quot;Juniperus communis&quot; &#x27;Vemboö&#x27; 

==Uses==

===Crafts===

It is too small to have any general lumber usage. In Scandinavia, however, juniper wood is used for making containers for storing small quantities of dairy products such as butter and cheese, and also for making wooden butter knives. It was also frequently used for trenails in wooden shipbuilding by shipwrights for its tough properties.

In Estonia juniper wood is valued for its long lasting and pleasant aroma, very decorative natural structure of wood (growth rings) as well as good physical properties of wood due to slow growth rate of juniper and resulting dense and strong wood. Various decorative items (often eating utensils) are common in most Estonian handicraft shops and households.

According to the old tradition, on Easter Monday Kashubian (Northern Poland) boys chase girls whipping their legs gently with juniper twigs. This is to bring good fortune in love to the chased girls.

Juniper wood, especially burl wood, is frequently used to make knife handles for French pocketknives such as the Laguiole.

===Culinary===

Its astringent blue-black seed cones, commonly known as juniper berries, are too bitter to eat raw and are usually sold dried and used to flavour meats, sauces, and stuffings. They are generally crushed before use to release their flavour. Since juniper berries have a strong taste, they should be used sparingly. They are generally used to enhance meat with a strong flavour, such as game, including game birds, or tongue.

The cones are used to flavour certain beers and gin (the word &quot;gin&quot; derives from an Old French word meaning &quot;juniper&quot;). In Finland, juniper is used as a key ingredient in making sahti, a traditional Finnish ale. Also the Slovak alcoholic beverage Borovička and Dutch Jenever are flavoured with juniper berry or its extract.

Archaeological evidence suggests that the use of juniper in brewing may date back to at least the early medieval period. Juniper remains have been found at migration period and early Merovingian sites in southwestern Germany, indicating it may have been used to flavor beverages like beer as early as the 3rd to 6th centuries AD.

Juniper is used in the traditional farmhouse ales of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. In Norway, the beer is brewed with juniper infusion instead of water, while in the other countries the juniper twigs are mainly used as filters to prevent the crushed malts from clogging the outlet of the lauter tun. The use of juniper in farmhouse brewing has been common in much of northern Europe, seemingly for a very long time.

===Traditional medicine===
Juniper berries have long been used as medicine by many cultures including the Navajo people. Western American tribes combined the berries of &quot;J. communis&quot; with &quot;Berberis&quot; root bark in a herbal tea. Native Americans also used juniper berries as a female contraceptive.

===Medicine===
Juniper leaves were found to harbor fungi with potent anti-fungal compounds, including ibrexafungerp, which is now FDA approved to treat fungal infections.

<text>A city centre is the commercial, cultural and often the historical, political, and geographic heart of a city. The term &quot;city centre&quot; is primarily used in British English, and closely equivalent terms that exist in other languages, such as &quot;&quot; in French, in German, or &quot;shìzhōngxīn&quot; () in Chinese. In the United States, the term &quot;downtown&quot; is generally used, though a few cities, like Philadelphia, use the term &quot;Center City&quot; or &quot;City Center&quot;.

==Overview and related concepts==

The city centre is the (often historical) area of a city where commerce, entertainment, shopping, and political power are concentrated. The term is commonly used in many English-speaking countries and has direct equivalents in many other languages. However, noticeably, in the United States, the term &quot;downtown&quot; is commonly used to denote a city centre, and in Canada the terms &quot;city centre&quot; and &quot;downtown&quot; are used interchangeably, most notable in the modern, purpose-built cores of former boroughs or newer suburban cities that had no traditional urban core (i.e. North York City Centre and Mississauga City Centre). In Australia, the term &quot;Central Business District&quot; is widely used to refer to the city centre, but usage of the term &quot;City Centre&quot; is increasing, especially in Melbourne. In South Africa, &quot;CBD&quot; is used in formal contexts, but in informal contexts, the city centre is referred to as &quot;town&quot;, and despite the growth of decentralised CBDs such as Sandton and uMhlanga &quot;town&quot; continues to refer to the original CBDs of cities.

In many cities, the Central Business District (CBD) is within the city centre, but the concept &quot;city centre&quot; differs from the CBD. The concept of the &quot;CBD&quot; revolves solely around economic and financial power, but the &quot;city centre&quot; also includes historical, political, and cultural factors. A clear example is Paris: La Défense is the central business district of Paris, but it is not the city centre. In most larger and/or older cities, the CBD and the city centre will only partially overlap, if at all.

A city centre is often the first settled part of a city, which can make it the most historical part of a city.

==Usage==
===Australia===
In most Australian cities, the city centre to some extent coincides with the central business district, with the result that &quot;the City&quot;, &quot;city centre&quot;, and &quot;central business district&quot; or &quot;CBD&quot; are regarded as near-synonyms. However, in some Australian cities, the city centre and the CBD are geographically separately identified. The term &quot;CBD&quot; is not often used in the capital Canberra, where the primary activity is government; its &quot;city centre&quot; is usually identified as the district called &quot;City&quot; or &quot;Civic&quot;.

===China===
In Chinese, the urban centre of a city is called the &quot;city centre&quot; or &quot;urban core&quot; (). In many cities, it is the historical city centre and the cultural and commercial centre. Historically, the CBD often occupied one portion of the city centre. In recent years, larger cities have often developed CBDs or financial districts that occupy a part of the city centre or are outside the historical city centre completely. For example, Beijing&#x27;s historical city centre is defined by the former city walls and remains the political and cultural centre of the city, but Beijing&#x27;s CBD sits in Chaoyang District, to the east of the historical city; Shanghai&#x27;s city centre was defined by the Old Chinese City, the International Settlement and the French Concession and sat on the west bank of the Huangpu River, whereas the modern financial district is concentrated on Lujiazui, a newly developed area across the river from the traditional city centre (although parts of the traditional city centre remain key financial and business centres).

===Israel===
The Hebrew term for &quot;city centre&quot; is a direct translation: &quot;מרכז העיר&quot; (merkaz ha&#x27;ir); however it is used inconsistently in different cities throughout Israel due to their extremely varied topographies and urban designs.
* In Jerusalem the term is used both colloquially and officially as the name of the commercial district that lies at the geographical center of the Western city. This area is many times larger, denser and more active than any of the city&#x27;s other commercial centres. The formation of a dedicated city centre resulted partially from geographical necessity; pedestrian travel between different neighborhoods is difficult due to the hilly terrain, so public transportation and wider roadways instead pull residents to one centralized location - atop the city&#x27;s central ridge-line - where they can congregate effectively. At the edges of the district the urban make-up shifts almost abruptly into residential neighborhoods, creating palpable boundaries. Much-smaller commercial centres within each residential neighborhood may meet day-to-day shopping needs, but mostly attract only local residents. In this way, Jerusalem&#x27;s residential neighborhoods function more like suburbs to the Jerusalem City Centre.
* By contrast, Tel Aviv follows a much more decentralized urban design scheme, with services, shopping, entertainment and cultural institutions spread out more evenly throughout the entire city. This design philosophy applies also to Tel Aviv&#x27;s many satellite cities (the &quot;Gush Dan&quot; metropolitan area), creating a much more uniform sprawl of commercial activity that only gradually decreases towards the suburbs. Decentralization provides a vast proportion of Tel Aviv&#x27;s residents with access to a large variety of services, shopping, and leisure activities very close to home, typically within walking or biking distance. As a result, the term &quot;Tel Aviv centre&quot; is often more of a geographical reference to the city&#x27;s central region, in contrast with &quot;north Tel Aviv&quot; and &quot;south Tel Aviv&quot; which have their own unique social atmospheres. This central region, encompassing roughly one third of the city&#x27;s total municipal area, does feature a higher concentration of leisure and shopping businesses, but is simultaneously also strongly residential - housing one third of the city&#x27;s residents. Nevertheless, most skyscrapers and non-service businesses in Gush Dan are situated at the edges of Tel Aviv centre or completely outside it - as result of a conscious decision of the municipal government to keep them out. This gives central Tel Aviv a very laid-back atmosphere relative to its central location within the heavily populated metropolis.
* Haifa, Israel&#x27;s third largest city, has its Central Business District situated at its geographical north along the shoreline of Haifa Bay. This flat, seaside area is called the &quot;Lower City&quot; of Haifa, in contrast to the neighborhoods on the slopes and peak of Mount Carmel to its southeast. Though it contains a few residential neighborhoods, the Lower City houses only 5% of the city&#x27;s entire population, and features almost all of its tallest structures, most of which are office spaces. Commercial and leisure centers in Haifa are mostly found outside the Lower City, and have attracted much more activity than the Lower City since the 1980s, leaving the Lower City partially dilapidated. New developments in the Lower City since the start of the 21st century aim to reverse this trend.

===Netherlands===

In Dutch, the terms &quot;binnenstad&quot;, &quot;centrum&quot;, &quot;stadscentrum&quot;, or &quot;stadskern&quot; are used to describe the city centre. Amsterdam is a clear example of the city centre and the central business district not being the same area. The city centre of Amsterdam is Centrum, the historical heart of the city, but the CBD areas of Amsterdam are Omval in the southeast and Zuidas, in the south. Additionally, Westpoort serves as the city&#x27;s industrial park.

Because of the bombardment of Rotterdam during World War II, with the loss of its historical core, the city centre and the CBD are the same area in Rotterdam.

===New Zealand===
City centre and central business district are used interchangeably in New Zealand for any urban area that had city status prior to the 1989 local government reorganisation which saw many city councils amalgamate with surrounding boroughs, counties and towns to form larger districts. Prior to 1989, city status was granted to a town or borough with a population greater than 20,000. In everyday language, New Zealanders often refer to city centres as going to &quot;town&quot;.

Wellington metropolitan area has 4 respective city centres in Wellington, Lower Hutt, Porirua and Upper Hutt whereas Auckland metropolitan area has 2 city centres in Auckland and Manukau. Timaru has a &quot;city centre&quot; whereas towns larger than it such as Blenheim or Pukekohe have &quot;town centres&quot; as they did not achieve city status prior to the 1989 local government reform which changed the population threshold for city status to 50,000.

<text>Juniperus virginiana, also known as eastern redcedar, red cedar, Virginian juniper, eastern juniper, red juniper, and other local names, is a species of juniper native to eastern North America from southeastern Canada to the Gulf of Mexico and east of the Great Plains. Farther west it is replaced by the related &quot;Juniperus scopulorum&quot; (Rocky Mountain juniper) and to the southwest by &quot;Juniperus ashei&quot; (Ashe juniper). It is not to be confused with &quot;Thuja occidentalis&quot; (eastern white cedar).

== Description ==
&quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot; is a dense slow-growing coniferous evergreen tree with a conical or subcylindrical shaped crown that may never become more than a bush on poor soil, but is ordinarily from tall, with a short trunk in diameter, rarely to in height and in diameter. The oldest tree reported, from West Virginia, was 940 years old. The bark is reddish-brown, fibrous, and peels off in narrow strips. The leaves are of two types; sharp, spreading needle-like juvenile leaves long, and tightly adpressed scale-like adult leaves long; they are arranged in opposite decussate pairs or occasionally whorls of three. The juvenile leaves are found on young plants up to 3 years old, and as scattered shoots on adult trees, usually in shade. The seed cones are long, berry-like, dark purple-blue with a white wax cover giving an overall sky-blue color (though the wax often rubs off); they contain one to three (rarely up to four) seeds, and are mature in 6–8 months from pollination. The juniper berry is an important winter food for many birds, which disperse the wingless seeds. The pollen cones are long and broad, shedding pollen in late winter or early spring. The trees are usually dioecious, with pollen and seed cones on separate trees, yet some are monoecious.

There are two varieties, which intergrade where they meet:
* &quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot; var. &quot;virginiana&quot; is called eastern juniper / redcedar. It is found in eastern North America, from Maine, west to southern Ontario and South Dakota, south to northernmost Florida and southwest into the post oak savannah of east-central Texas. Cones are larger, ; scale leaves are acute at apex and bark is red-brown.
* &quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot; var. &quot;silicicola&quot; (syn. &quot;Sabina silicicola&quot; , &quot;Juniperus silicicola&quot; ) is known as southern or sand juniper / redcedar. Its variety name means &quot;flint-dweller&quot;, from Latin and . Habitat is along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from the extreme southeastern corner of Virginia, south to central Florida and west to southeast Texas. Cones are smaller, ; scale leaves are blunt at apex and the bark is orange-brown. It is treated by some authors at the lower rank of variety, while others treat it as a distinct species.

== Ecology ==
Eastern Red Cedar is a pioneer species, meaning that it is one of the first trees to repopulate disturbed sites. It is unusually long lived among pioneer species, with the potential to live over 900 years. It is commonly found in prairies or oak barrens, old pastures, or limestone hills, often along highways and near recent construction sites. It is an alternate host for cedar–apple rust, an economically significant fungal disease of apples, and some management strategies recommend the removal of &quot;J. virginiana&quot; near apple orchards

Eastern Red Cedar grows in a wide range of climatic and soil conditions. The tree is extremely tolerant of drought due to its extensive, fibrous root system and reduced leaf area. It can be found from droughty, rocky soils with few nutrients to rich alluvial soils with abundant moisture. However, Eastern Red Cedar is almost never dominant on such rich mesic sites due to intense competition with faster growing, more shade tolerant hardwood trees.

Outside of its native range it is considered an invasive species, and it can be aggressive even within its range. It is fire-intolerant, and was previously controlled by periodic wildfires. Low branches near the ground burn and provide a ladder that allows fire to engulf the whole tree. Grasses recover quickly from low severity fires that are characteristic of prairies that kept the trees at bay. With the urbanization of prairies, the fires have been stopped with roads, plowed fields, and other fire breaks, allowing &quot;J. virginiana&quot; and other trees to invade. Trees are destructive to grasslands if left unchecked, and are actively being eliminated by cutting and prescribed burning. The trees also burn very readily, and dense populations were blamed for the rapid spread of wildfires in drought stricken Oklahoma and Texas in 2005 and 2006. On the Great Plains, expanding red cedar populations are altering the plains ecosystem: a majority of the region&#x27;s bird species are not present in areas where the tree&#x27;s land cover exceeds 10 percent, and most small mammal species are not present where land cover exceeds 30 percent.

Eastern juniper benefits from increased CO2 levels, unlike the grasses with which it competes. Many grasses are C4 plants that concentrate CO2 levels in their bundle sheaths to increase the efficiency of RuBisCO, the enzyme responsible for photosynthesis, while junipers are C3 plants that rely on (and may benefit from) the natural CO2 concentrations of the environment, although they are less efficient at fixing CO2 in general.

Alterations of prairie ecosystems by &quot;J. virginiana&quot; include outcompeting forage species in pastureland. The low branches and wide base occupy a significant portion of land area. The thick foliage blocks out most light, so few plants can live under the canopy. The needles that fall raise the pH of the soil, making it alkaline, which holds nutrients such as phosphorus, making it harder for plants to absorb them. However, studies have found that &quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot; forests that replace grasslands have a statistically insignificant decrease to a significant increase in levels of soil nitrogen. &quot;J. virginiana&quot; forests have higher overall nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), despite the common grassland species &quot;Andropogon gerardi&quot; having a far higher NUE during photosynthesis (PNUE). The forests store much greater amounts of carbon in both biomass and soil, with most of the additional carbon stored aboveground. There is no significant difference in soil microbial activity.

Cedar waxwings are fond of juniper berries. It takes about 12 minutes for their seeds to pass through the birds&#x27; guts, and seeds that have been consumed by this bird have levels of germination roughly three times higher than those of seeds the birds did not eat. Many other birds such as turkeys and bluebirds, along with many mammals such as rabbits, foxes, raccoons, and coyotes also consume them.

Virginia Juniper&#x27;s compact, evergreen foliage makes it favorable for bird nests and as a winter shelter location for birds and mammals. Some species of small mammals live exclusively in red cedar forests. 

== Pollen ==
The pollen of &quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot; var. &quot;virginiana&quot; is a known allergen. The nominate variety is native to Eastern North America, north of Mexico, with the pollen releasing at various points in the spring, variable by latitude and elevation.

== Uses ==
The fragrant, finely grained, soft, brittle, very light, pinkish to brownish red heartwood is very durable, even in contact with soil. Because of its resistance to decay, the wood is often used for fence posts. Moths avoid the aromatic wood, and therefore it is in demand as lining for clothes chests and closets, which are often denominated &quot;cedar closets&quot; and &quot;cedar chests.&quot; If correctly prepared, excellent English longbows, flatbows, and Native American sinew-backed bows can be made from it. It is marketed as &quot;eastern redcedar&quot; and &quot;aromatic cedar.&quot; The best portions of the heartwood are one of the few woods that are suitable for making pencils, however the supply had so diminished by the 1940s that the wood of the incense-cedar largely replaced it.

Part of the commercially available cedar oil is produced by steam distillation from wood shavings. It contains a wide variety of terpenes. The three major components, alpha-cedrene, thujopsene and cedrol, constitute more than 60% of the essential oil. The fruits also yield an essential oil which contains mostly D-Limonene.

The oil derived from foliage and twigs has two main constituents: safrole and limonene. One minor compound is the podophyllotoxin, a non-alkaloid toxin lignan.

Native American tribes have historically used poles of juniper wood to demarcate agreed tribal hunting territories. French traders named Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which denotes &quot;red stick,&quot; from the reddish color of these poles. Some nations continue to use it ceremonially.

The Cahokia Woodhenge series of timber circles that the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in western Illinois erected were constructed of massive logs of eastern juniper. One iteration of such a circle, &quot;Woodhenge III&quot;, which is thought to have been constructed circa 1000 AD, had 48 posts in the circle of in diameter and a 49th pole in the center.

Among many Native American cultures, the smoke of burning eastern juniper is believed to expel evil spirits prior to conducting a ceremony, such as a healing ceremony.

During the Dust Bowl drought of the 1930s, the Prairie States Forest Project encouraged farmers to plant shelterbelts, i.e. wind breaks, of eastern juniper throughout the Great Plains of the US. The trees thrive in adverse conditions. Tolerant of both drought and cold, they grow well in rocky, sandy, and clayey soils. Competition between individual trees is minimal, and therefore they can be closely planted in rows, in which situation they still grow to full height, creating a solid windbreak in a short time.

A number of cultivars have been selected for horticulture, including &#x27;Canaertii&#x27; (narrow conical; female) &#x27;Corcorcor&#x27; (with a dense, erect crown; female), &#x27;Goldspire&#x27; (narrow conical with yellow foliage), and &#x27;Kobold&#x27; (dwarf). Some cultivars previously listed under this species, notably &#x27;Skyrocket&#x27;, are actually cultivars of &quot;J. scopulorum&quot;.

In the Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma Ozarks, eastern juniper is commonly used as a Christmas tree.

This is the most widely used wood for making blocks for recorders. There are numerous properties that it possesses that make it uniquely suitable for this, such as good moisture absorption, low expansion when wet (so it does not crack the recorder head), and mild antiseptic properties.

Eastern red cedar is considered effective as a shelter-belt tree and for erosion control. Being coniferous, red cedar has dense evergreen foliage which makes it an ideal windbreak. The tree&#x27;s extensive root system allows it to survive drought, and helps to retain surrounding topsoil during dry, windy conditions.

<doc id="446151" wikidata="Q309507" url="?curid=446151" title="Juniperus ashei">
<text>Juniperus ashei (Ashe juniper, mountain cedar, blueberry juniper, post cedar, or just cedar) is a drought-tolerant evergreen tree, native from northeastern Mexico and the south-central United States to southern Missouri. The largest areas are in central Texas, where extensive stands occur. Ashe juniper grows up to tall, and over time can reach , and provides erosion control and year-round shade for wildlife and livestock.

==Description==
The feathery foliage grows in dense sprays, bright green in color. The leaves are scale-like, long, and produced on rounded (not flattened) shoots. It is a dioecious species, with separate male and female plants. The seed cones are round, long, and soft, pulpy and berry-like, green at first, maturing purple about 8 months after pollination. They contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed when birds eat the cones and pass the seeds in their droppings. The male cones are 3–5 mm long, yellow, turning brown after pollen release in December to February.

==Scientific name==
The specific name &quot;ashei&quot; pays homage to American forester and botanist William Willard Ashe.

==As an invasive species==
Despite being native to Texas, ashe juniper is often considered an invasive species and weed by many landowners and ranchers. It is commonly believed that they use more water than live oaks, but more recent research suggests the reverse.

Ashe juniper thrives on ranches, as cattle avoid the bitter-tasting seedlings. In contrast to the redberry juniper, ashe juniper does not resprout when cut.

==Allergens==

Ashe juniper pollen, along with that of the related &quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot;, can cause a severe allergic reaction. Consequently, what begins as a winter allergy may extend into spring, as the pollination of &quot;J. virginiana&quot; follows that of &quot;J. ashei&quot;. Colloquially, many Texans refer to the allergy as cedar fever.

==Uses==

Spanish explorers who arrived in what is now Texas in the mid-18th century built Hill Country missions using ashe junipers for roof beams. Poor land management, due to decades of clearcutting and overgrazing, led to soil erosion and a preponderance of caliche. The ashe juniper was one of the few plants that could thrive in the rocky soil.

The wood is naturally rot-resistant and provides raw material for fence posts. Posts cut from old-growth Ashe junipers have been known to last in the ground for more than 50 years. Over 100 years ago, most old-growth Ashe junipers were cut and used not only for fence posts, but also for foundation piers, telegraph and telephone poles, roof framing, and railroad ties.

The berry-like cones are eaten by a number of wildlife. The endangered golden-cheeked warbler uses the shredding bark of older Mountain Cedars to build its nests and old-growth cedar brakes and juniper-oak woodlands as habitat.

<doc id="446154" wikidata="Q3112939" url="?curid=446154" title="Dordt University">
<text>Dordt University is a private evangelical Christian university in Sioux Center, Iowa. It was founded in 1955 and is affiliated with the Christian Reformed Church in North America. The university name is a reference to the Synod of Dordt (Dordrecht).

Dordt annually enrolls about 1,500 students. The university offers 90 programs of study that lead to Associate of Arts, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science in Engineering, Bachelor of Social Work, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, and Master of Education degrees.

== History ==
Dordt University was founded as Midwest Christian Junior College in 1953. In 1954, a group of men from local Christian Reformed Churches in Iowa, South Dakota and Minnesota agreed to establish the college in Sioux Center. It was tentatively referred to as Midwest Christian Junior College, and the first classes were held at the college in the fall of 1955 with about 40 students.

In April 1956, the name was changed to Dordt College. This name was chosen to honor a historic 17th century Reformed church meeting called the Synod of Dordt that took place in the Netherlands in 1618–1619.

The first graduating class consisted of 18 students in 1957. The first students to earn B.A. degrees graduated in 1965. The college changed its name to Dordt University on May 13, 2019.

== Academics ==
Dordt offers over 90 programs of study with over 40 majors and 11 pre-professional programs of study. The core is drawn from various academic disciplines such as language, natural science, and social science.

Dordt is accredited to grant bachelor and Master of Education degrees by the Higher Learning Commission. Furthermore, the engineering program is ABET accredited, the nursing program is accredited by the National League for Nursing and the Iowa Board of Nursing and the social work program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education.

Dordt offers more than 25 off-campus study opportunities in countries around the world through its affiliation with the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities. These countries include Australia, China, France, Ghana, Honduras, Hungary, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain, Uganda, and the United Kingdom. Off-campus programs also exist for Chicago, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles.

Ninety-eight percent of students receive financial aid in the form of scholarships, grants, loans, and work-study opportunities. The university awards scholarships based on academic potential and performance (e.g., the Kuyper Honors program), activities (e.g., sports, theater, music), and demonstrated financial need. Over $18.5 million is awarded in financial aid annually, thanks in large part to private donors and alumni.

== Campus ==

The university is located in Sioux Center, Iowa, about north of Sioux City, and southeast of Sioux Falls, SD. The campus covers a area and includes 25 buildings, eleven for student housing.

The hub of the campus is the Campus Center. The facility was constructed in 2002 at a cost of $12.5 million and is open continuously during the academic year. The entry level consists of a campus store, an art gallery, meditation rooms, and a student lounge. The upper level features enhanced-technology classrooms, conference rooms, and various offices. The lower-level houses an activity center, a dining area, a snack bar, and Campus Health. The basement features a recording studio and a game room complete with a four-lane regulation-size bowling alley, as well as foosball and pool tables.

=== Academic facilities ===
The campus center is the John and Louise Hulst Library, which houses a collection of more than 300,000 book volumes, 16,000 print journal volumes, and 163,000 microtext units. The library subscribes to more than 600 journals, magazines, and newspapers, and has electronic access to another 10,000 titles. In addition to providing print and electronic resources, the library serves the campus media needs by offering checkout availability of various media equipment. The library has a significant collection of curriculum and children&#x27;s literature materials housed in the Learning Resource Center. Other specialized collections include the Dordt University Archives and the Dutch Memorial Collection.

The Science and Technology Center at has 180- and 80-seat lecture halls, a greenhouse, laboratories, general-use classrooms, and various science departmental offices. There are laboratories for organic chemistry, physical chemistry and physics. It also houses agriculture facilities for animal science and agronomy labs. The engineering wing includes labs for mechanical engineering, electronics, electrical engineering, and computer-aided design. The Science and Technology Center is connected to the Campus Center via a sky walk, which was constructed in 2017.

=== B. J. Haan Auditorium ===

The B. J. Haan Auditorium seats approximately 1,500 people and is used for chapel services, concerts, organ recitals, and other regional events. Convocation and commencement exercises are also held in &quot;the Beej&quot;, as it is called by students. The auditorium features a three-manual, tracker-action Casavant Frères organ with 37 stops, 57 ranks, and 2,833 pipes.

The auditorium is adjoined by the Music Building, which also has rehearsal rooms, studios and classrooms, vocal and instrumental practice rooms, and music faculty offices. Its mezzanine also houses the .

The auditorium was the site of a campaign rally by candidate Donald J. Trump on January 23, 2016, during the race for the 2016 Iowa Republican presidential caucuses.

<text>The African Baptist Assembly of Malawi is a Baptist Christian denomination in Malawi. It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance. The headquarters is in Chilembwe.

==History==
The African Baptist Assembly of Malawi has its origins in an Australian mission of Joseph Booth, with the Zambezi Industrial Mission in 1892, which he convinced British Baptists to help finance. He was also involved in the Nyaza Industrial Mission (1893) and the Baptist Industrial Mission (1895). In 1897, Booth took Yao tribesman John Chilembwe (ca.1871-1915) to America, where the National Baptist Convention, USA sponsored his education at the Virginia Theological Seminary and College at Lynchburg, Virginia. In 1900 Chilembwe returned to Africa under the banner of the National Baptist Convention, USA and established the Providence Industrial Mission. After Chilembwe was killed on February 4, 1915, while leading an uprising against British authority, the government banned the &quot;Providence Mission&quot;. Today the nation of Malawi regards and honors Chilembwe as a martyr. His face appears on the 200 Kwacha (Malawian currency).

In 1926, the British government allowed the &quot;Providence Industrial Mission&quot; to be reopened under Daniel Sharpe Malekebu (ca.1890-1978). Malekbu had been trained in medical and Bible school in the United States. In 1945, he led Baptists to form the &quot;National Baptist Assembly of Africa, Nyasaland&quot;. This group has experienced two divisions, resulting in the formation of the African United Baptist Church (1946) and the &quot;Independent Baptist Church&quot; (1971).

According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 800 churches and 72,000 members.

<doc id="446161" wikidata="Q119039690" url="?curid=446161" title="Bound and free morphemes">
<text>In linguistics, a bound morpheme is a morpheme (the elementary unit of morphosyntax) that can appear only as part of a larger expression, while a free morpheme (or unbound morpheme) is one that can stand alone. A bound morpheme is a type of bound form, and a free morpheme is a type of free form.

==Occurrence in isolation==
A form is a free form if it can occur in isolation as a complete utterance, e.g. &quot;Johnny is running&quot;, or &quot;Johnny&quot;, or &quot;running&quot; (this can occur as the answer to a question such as &quot;What is he doing?&quot;). A form that cannot occur in isolation is a bound form, e.g. &quot;-y&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, and &quot;-ing&quot; (in &quot;Johnny is running&quot;). Non-occurrence in isolation is given as the primary criterion for boundness in most linguistics textbooks.

==Roots and affixes==

Affixes are bound by definition. English language affixes are almost exclusively prefixes or suffixes: &quot;pre-&quot; in &quot;precaution&quot; and &quot;-ment&quot; in &quot;shipment&quot;. Affixes may be inflectional, indicating how a certain word relates to other words in a larger phrase, or derivational, changing either the part of speech or the actual meaning of a word. 

Most roots in English are free morphemes (e.g. &quot;examin-&quot; in &quot;examination&quot;, which can occur in isolation: &quot;examine&quot;), but others are bound (e.g. &quot;bio-&quot; in &quot;biology&quot;). Words like &quot;chairman&quot; that contain two free morphemes (&quot;chair&quot; and &quot;man&quot;) are referred to as compound words.

Cranberry morphemes are a special form of bound morpheme whose independent meaning has been displaced and serves only to distinguish one word from another, like in &quot;cranberry,&quot; in which the free morpheme &quot;berry&quot; is preceded by the bound morpheme &quot;cran-,&quot; meaning &quot;crane&quot; from the earlier name for the berry, &quot;crane berry&quot;.

An empty morpheme is a special type of bound morpheme with no inherent meaning. Empty morphemes change the phonetics of a word but offer no semantic value to the word as a whole.

Examples:

==Word formation==

Words can be formed purely from bound morphemes, as in English &quot;permit,&quot; ultimately from Latin &quot;through&quot; + &quot;I send&quot;, where &quot;per-&quot; and &quot;-mit&quot; are bound morphemes in English. However, they are often thought of as simply a single morpheme. Per is not a bound morpheme; a bound morpheme, by definition, cannot stand alone as a word. Per is a standalone word as seen in the sentence, &quot;I go to the gym twice per day.&quot;

A similar example is given in Chinese; most of its morphemes are monosyllabic and identified with a Chinese character because of the largely morphosyllabic script, but disyllabic words exist that cannot be analyzed into independent morphemes, such as 蝴蝶 &quot;húdié&quot; &#x27;butterfly&#x27;. Then, the individual syllables and corresponding characters are used only in that word, and while they can be interpreted as bound morphemes 蝴 &quot;hú-&quot; and 蝶 &quot;-dié,&quot; it is more commonly considered a single disyllabic morpheme. See polysyllabic Chinese morphemes for further discussion.

Linguists usually distinguish between productive and unproductive forms when speaking about morphemes. For example, the morpheme &quot;ten-&quot; in &quot;tenant&quot; was originally derived from the Latin word , &quot;to hold&quot;, and the same basic meaning is seen in such words as &quot;tenable&quot; and &quot;intention.&quot; But as &quot;ten-&quot; is not used in English to form new words, most linguists would not consider it to be a morpheme at all.

==Analytic and synthetic languages==

A language with a very low morpheme-to-word ratio is an isolating language. Because such a language uses few bound morphemes, it expresses most grammatical relationships by word order or helper words, so it is an analytic language.

In contrast, a language that uses a substantial number of bound morphemes to express grammatical relationships is a synthetic language.

<doc id="446165" wikidata="Q456174" url="?curid=446165" title="Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia">
<text>Boleslaus II the Pious ( ; 932 – 7 February 999), a member of the Přemyslid dynasty, was Duke of Bohemia from 972 until his death in 999.

==Life and reign==
Boleslaus was an elder son of Duke Boleslaus I the Cruel and brother of the three other children of his father who survived to adulthood: Strachkvas, Doubravka (the wife of Duke Mieszko I of Poland) and the abbess Mlada. His mother may have been Biagota, a mysterious figure known only from her coins. According to some historians, she was the wife of Boleslaus I.

===Alliances===
Boleslaus II took over the rule of the Duchy of Bohemia as &quot;kníže&quot; (a title that may be translated either as duke or prince) on his father&#x27;s death in 972. Like his father, Boleslaus II initially quarrelled with the Ottonian kings of Germany. In 974, he and Duke Mieszko I of Poland supported the rebellious Duke Henry II of Bavaria in his civil war against the rule of Emperor Otto II. In 976, Henry was defeated and fled to Boleslaus&#x27; court at Prague Castle, after which Otto&#x27;s forces campaigned in the Bohemian lands. Finally in 978, Boleslaus solemnly pledged allegiance to the emperor at the Easter festivities in Quedlinburg. 

In turn, relations with Poland deteriorated from about 980 onwards. When Emperor Otto II died in 983 and was succeeded by his minor son Otto III, the Bohemian alliance with Poland was discarded, as Boleslaus again allied with the insurgent Bavarian Duke Henry, while Mieszko I took the side of the young king. Moreover, when Boleslaus occupied the Saxon Margravate of Meissen, he thwarted the plans of Mieszko&#x27;s son Bolesław, who had married a daughter of Margrave Ricdag. In 987, Boleslaus had to retire from Meissen, and from about 990, he sparked a long-lasting conflict with Poland around the lands of Silesia and Lesser Poland (the Polish-Bohemian War). In 992, he approached King Otto III and participated in an unsuccessful campaign against the Lutici tribes in the wake of the Great Slav Rising of 983.

===Unification of the Bohemian lands===

Boleslaus&#x27;s reign is most notable for the foundation of the Diocese of Prague in 973, which earned him the epithet &quot;The Pious&quot; by the medieval chronicler Cosmas of Prague. Nevertheless, the Bohemian diocese was placed at that time within the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Mainz, and Emperor Otto II enforced the appointment of the Saxon monk Thietmar (&quot;Dětmar&quot;) as first bishop. 

Meanwhile, the struggle with the rival Slavník dynasty flared up again from 981 onwards, when Prince Soběslav of the Slavník dynasty began to forge alliances with the Polish and Saxons. Upon Bishop Dětmar&#x27;s death in 982, Soběslav&#x27;s brother Adalbert (later known as Saint Adalbert of Prague) was appointed his successor until he abandoned his primacy to lead a mission to the Old Prussians in 994. On 28 September 995, Boleslaus&#x27; forces and the confederate Vršovci clan stormed Libice Castle in southern Bohemia and massacred the members of the Slavník dynasty that were found there. Boleslaus&#x27;s brutal triumph ensured the unity of Bohemia under a single ruler.

== Marriages and issue ==

Boleslaus&#x27;s first wife Adiva may have been a daughter of the English king Edward the Elder (the daughter known to English historians as &quot;Ælfgifu&quot; who married a prince &quot;near the Alps&quot;), though the evidence for this is weak. His second wife was Emma of Mělník. It is certain that Boleslaus&#x27;s oldest son was born by Adiva, but the mother of the others cannot be established with certainty:
* Boleslaus III (c. 965 – 1037), his eldest son and successor
* Wenceslaus, died as an infant
* Jaromír (c. 975 - 1035), became Duke of Bohemia in 1003
* Oldřich (c.  975 – 1034), became Duke of Bohemia in 1012.
Soon after his father&#x27;s death, Boleslaus III entered into conflict with his brothers and was deposed in 1002. The internal struggles of the Přemyslid dynasty shook the Bohemian duchy until Duke Oldřich&#x27;s efforts stabilised the country.

<doc id="446171" wikidata="Q3954090" url="?curid=446171" title="Secret Six">
<text>The so-called Secret Six, or the Secret Committee of Six, were a group of men who secretly funded the 1859 raid on Harper&#x27;s Ferry by abolitionist John Brown.
Sometimes described as &quot;wealthy,&quot; this was true of only two. The other four were in positions of influence, and could, therefore, encourage others to contribute to &quot;the cause.&quot;

The name &quot;Secret Six&quot; was invented by writers long after Brown&#x27;s death. The term never appears in the testimony at Brown&#x27;s trial, in James Redpath&#x27;s &quot;The Public Life of Capt. John Brown&quot; (1859), or in the &quot;Memoirs of John Brown&quot; of Franklin Benjamin Sanborn (1878). The men involved helped Brown as individuals and did not work together or correspond with each other. They were never in the same room at the same time, and in some cases barely knew each other.

==Background==
The Secret Six were Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Samuel Gridley Howe, Theodore Parker, Franklin Benjamin Sanborn, Gerrit Smith, and George Luther Stearns. All six had been involved in the abolitionist cause prior to their meeting John Brown, and had gradually become convinced that violence was necessary in order to end American slavery.

Of the six, only Smith and Stearns could be called wealthy. The others consisted of two Unitarian ministers (Parker and Higginson), a doctor (Howe) at a time when physicians were not well-to-do, and a teacher (Sanborn). Smith was one of the guarantors of a bail bond for Jefferson Davis after the Civil War.

To the extent the group had a leader, it was Brown biographer Sanborn. &quot;Some of the money and nearly all the correspondence relating to the contributions passed through my hands in 1858–9. ...[W]e all raised money to aid Brown in carrying this plan forward.&quot;

==Involvement with John Brown==

Brown was planning to capture weapons from a federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia), and lead a slave rebellion in the South. While it is unclear whether these men knew of Brown&#x27;s ultimate plan, it is known that some were ambivalent regarding the use of violence as a way to bring about the destruction of slavery. Brown met with members of the Six several times during 1858 and 1859 to discuss how he would attack the slave system.

In October 1859, Brown&#x27;s plan failed. The question immediately arose of who was backing Brown, as his declarations that the raid was his own idea were not believed. Speculation and then testimony, reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;New-York Herald,&quot; and other papers, began to link the names of the Six with Brown&#x27;s. On November 7, Smith had himself confined to an insane asylum, denying that he had been involved in supporting Brown. Howe, Sanborn, and Stearns fled to Canada temporarily to avoid arrest. Parker was already in Italy, a guest of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, as it was believed that a warm climate was helpful to those suffering from tuberculosis.

&quot;We did not know that Brown meant to begin there, in Virginia, at Harper&#x27;s Ferry,&quot; Sanborn insisted. Like Gerrit Smith, Sanborn felt justified in making public statements which told a part of the truth, but not the whole truth. &quot;We expected he would go farther west, into a region less accessible, where his movements might escape notice for weeks, except as the alleged acts of some marauding party.&quot;
On the night of April 3, 1860, five federal marshals arrived at Frank Sanborn&#x27;s home in Concord, Massachusetts, handcuffed him, and attempted to wrestle him into a coach and take him to Washington to answer questions before the Senate in regard to his involvement with John Brown. Approximately 150 townspeople rushed to Sanborn&#x27;s defense. Judge Ebenezer R. Hoar issued a writ of replevin, formally demanding the surrender of the prisoner. In a letter to a friend, Louisa May Alcott wrote, &quot;Sanborn was nearly kidnapped. Great ferment in town. Annie Whiting immortalized herself by getting into the kidnapper&#x27;s carriage so that they could not put the long legged martyr in.&quot;

Parker, dying of tuberculosis, remained in Italy until his death in 1860. Higginson was the sole member of the Six to stay in the United States and to publicly proclaim his support for Brown. He even developed a plan to have Brown rescued from his jail cell, but Brown did not want to be rescued. Higginson asked Sanborn upon the latter&#x27;s absconding to Canada, &quot;Can your clear moral sense justify our holding our tongues in order to save ourselves from the reprobation of society, even as that nobler man whom we did provoke to enter into danger becomes the scapegoat of that reprobation, going for us even to the gallows?&quot;
==Aftermath==

In January 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect, a celebration, also called a &quot;John Brown party&quot;, was held at the home of George Stearns, attended by Sam and Julia Ward Howe, Frank Sanborn, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Wendell Phillips, and John Murray Forbes. Higginson, who was busy commanding a regiment of black Union soldiers, sent his regrets. Gerrit Smith did not respond to Stearns&#x27; invitation. A marble bust of John Brown, created by sculptor Edwin Brackett, was unveiled at this time.

In 1867, Gerrit Smith helped post bail to release the imprisoned former Confederate President, Jefferson Davis. Smith&#x27;s wife wrote to Sanborn in 1874, confirming that her husband had destroyed every one of his letters having anything to do with John Brown. Sanborn likewise combed through his own papers and letters, weeding out anything implicating himself or his partners in Brown&#x27;s raid. Only some letters to Theodore Parker, which came back to Sanborn a year and more after his death, were not destroyed at this time.

For the remainder of their lives, Higginson, Sanborn, and Stearns made periodic pilgrimages to Brown&#x27;s grave in North Elba, New York. Frank Sanborn saw to it that the daughters of John Brown received an education in Concord, and even after the turn of the twentieth century took a measure of responsibility for Brown&#x27;s children and grandchildren.

Higginson expressed the wish that disunion could have been achieved &quot;without the sacrifice of Brown&quot; and believed a counter-proposal to the Harper&#x27;s Ferry scheme should have been made—one that protected Brown from himself, believing the Six should have perceived &quot;the madness that dwelled within him—the insanity that sat stealthily beside his great, selfless nobility.&quot;

In 1905, Higginson co-founded the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, along with attorney Clarence Darrow, Jack London, and Upton Sinclair.

After Sanborn&#x27;s death in 1917, the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts adopted a bill applauding him for his various life works, with special mention given to Sanborn&#x27;s role as &quot;confidential adviser to John Brown of Harper&#x27;s Ferry, for whose sake he was ostracized, maltreated, and subjected to the indignity of false arrest, having been saved from deportation from Massachusetts only by mob violence.&quot;

<doc id="446176" wikidata="Q1277054" url="?curid=446176" title="Earl Ferrers">
<text>Earl Ferrers is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1711 for Robert Shirley, 14th Baron Ferrers of Chartley. The Shirley family descends from George Shirley (died 1622) of Astwell Castle, Northamptonshire. In 1611 he was created a Baronet, of Staunton Harold in the County of Leicester, in the Baronetage of England. He was succeeded by his son Henry, the second Baronet, who married Lady Dorothy Devereux, daughter of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. On the death of her brother Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, she became the youngest co-heir to the baronies of Ferrers of Chartley and the barony of Bourchier, which had fallen into abeyance on the death of the third Earl. Shirley was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Baronet. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Baronet. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London by Oliver Cromwell and died there in 1656. On his death the title passed to his eldest son, the fifth Baronet. He died at an early age and was succeeded at birth by his posthumous son, the sixth Baronet.

He died as an infant and was succeeded by his uncle, the seventh Baronet. In 1677 King Charles II terminated the abeyance of the barony of Ferrers of Chartley in his favour and he became the thirteenth Baron Ferrers of Chartley. His claim to the barony of Bourchier was overlooked, however. He later served as Master of the Horse and as Lord Steward to the queen consort, Catherine of Braganza, and was Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire. In 1711 he was created Viscount Tamworth, of Tamworth in the County of Stafford, and Earl Ferrers, in the Peerage of Great Britain. He was succeeded in the barony of Ferrers of Chartley by his granddaughter Elizabeth, wife of James Compton, 5th Earl of Northampton. She was the daughter of the first Earl&#x27;s eldest son the Hon. Robert Shirley (1673–1698), who predeceased his father (see the Baron Ferrers of Chartley for further history of this title). Lord Ferrers was succeeded in the baronetcy, viscountcy and earldom by his second son, the second Earl. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire from 1725 to 1729. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Earl. He was Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire from 1731 to 1742.

He died unmarried and was succeeded by his nephew, the fourth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. Lawrence Shirley, third surviving son of the first Earl. Lord Ferrers killed Mr Johnson, his land-steward, was tried, condemned for murder and hanged at Tyburn on 5 May 1760. Ferrers petitioned to be beheaded at the Tower of London as had been the case with noble lords before him. He is the last British peer to die a felon&#x27;s death. On his death the titles passed to his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy. He was childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth Earl. His eldest son, the seventh Earl, died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the eighth Earl. When the latter died the titles passed to his grandson, the ninth Earl. He was the son of Robert William Shirley, Viscount Tamworth, eldest son of the eighth Earl. He was succeeded by his son, the tenth Earl. On his death in 1912 the line of the sixth Earl failed. The late Earl was succeeded by his third cousin, the eleventh Earl. He was the great-great-grandson of Reverend the Hon.

<doc id="446183" wikidata="Q136884" url="?curid=446183" title="Lazica">
<text>The Kingdom of Lazica (, ; , ; , ), sometimes called Lazian Empire, was a state in the territory of west Georgia in the Roman period, from about the 1st century BC. Created as a result of the collapse of the kingdom of Colchis and the gaining of independence by the tribal-territorial units included in it in 131 AD.

== Name ==
In the Svan language, the Svans refer to the Mingrelia (Samegrelo) region as Lazan, La- is the Svan territorial prefix and Lazan means &quot;the land of the Zans&quot;.

== History ==

By the mid-3rd century, Lazica was given partial autonomy within the Roman Empire and developed into a kingdom. Throughout much of its existence, it was mainly a Byzantine strategic vassal kingdom that briefly came under Sasanian Persian rule during the Lazic War. The kingdom fell to the Muslim conquest in the 7th century. Lazica in the 8th century successfully repelled the Arab occupation and formed part of the Kingdom of Abkhazia from c. 780, one of the early medieval polities which would converge into the unified kingdom of Georgia in the 11th century.

The parts of the Lazian Empire were Suani, Scymni, Western Abasgia, Eastern Abasgia(Apsilia), Misimiani and their rulers would be appointed by the kings of Lazica with the formally upon the approval of the Byzantine emperor.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
In the early 4th century, the Christian eparchy (eastern bishopric) of Pityus was established in this kingdom, and as in neighboring Iberia Christianity was declared as an official religion in AD 319. Other ancient episcopal sees in Lazica include Rhodopolis, Saesina, and Zygana. Bishop Stratophilus of Pityus was among the participants of the First Council of Nicaea in 325. The first Christian king of Lazica was Gubazes I; in the 5th century, Christianity was made the official religion of Lazica. Later, the nobility and clergy of Lazica switched from the Hellenic ecclesiastic tradition to the Georgian, and Georgian became the language of culture and education. The Bichvinta Cathedral is one of oldest monuments of Georgian Christian architecture. It was constructed by King Bagrat III of Georgia (978-1014, an Orthodox saint).

== Cities and forts ==
The information about the cities of Lazica were preserved in the works of Byzantine historians. The list of cities mentioned in Byzantine sources were:

* Petra (modern Tsikhisdziri)
* Archeopolis (Nokalakevi)
* Nesos (Isula)
* Telefis (Tolebi)
* Rhodopolis (Vartsikhe)
* Skanda
* Sarapanis (Shorpani)
* Phasis (Poti)
* Pitius
* Kotayon (Kutaisi)
* Onoguris
The most significant fertile and rich area of Lazica was the Rioni river valley. A densely populated part of the territory of Colchis, where most of the Laz cities were located. In the IV-V centuries AD large cities appeared in Lazica such as: Archeopolis, Rhodopolis and Kotayon, and the population of the coastal areas increased, mainly in the areas of Phasis.

The architecture of the fortresses of Lazica, located at the key points of the main trade and military routes from the shores of the Black Sea to Iran, show the influence of Byzantine architecture

== Economy ==
Maritime trade played a significant role in the country&#x27;s economy, the center of which was the port of Phasis. Trade was carried out mainly with Pontus and Bosporus (Crimea), which were under Roman control at the time. Leather, fur and other raw materials, as well as slaves, were exported from the country in large quantities. In exchange, they imported salt, bread, wine, expensive fabrics and weapons. It is believed that the destruction of free trade and the introduction of a monopoly by the Romans in Lazica was one of the reasons for the Lazic war.

The primary currency used in Lazica for trade was the Roman Antoninianus until the 4th century. Afterwards it was replaced by the Byzantine Solidus.

<doc id="446184" wikidata="Q556298" url="?curid=446184" title="Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory">
<text>The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) is a standardized psychometric test of adult personality and psychopathology. A version for adolescents also exists, the MMPI-A, and was first published in 1992. Psychologists and other mental health professionals use various versions of the MMPI to help develop treatment plans, assist with differential diagnosis, help answer legal questions (forensic psychology), screen job candidates during the personnel selection process, or as part of a therapeutic assessment procedure.

The original MMPI was developed by Starke R. Hathaway and J. C. McKinley, faculty of the University of Minnesota, and first published by the University of Minnesota Press in 1943. It was replaced by an updated version, the MMPI-2, in 1989 (Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, and Kaemmer). An alternative version of the test, the MMPI-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF), published in 2008, retains some aspects of the traditional MMPI assessment strategy, but adopts a different theoretical approach to personality test development. The newest version (MMPI-3) was released in 2020.

== History ==
The original authors of the MMPI were American psychologist Starke R. Hathaway and American neurologist J. C. McKinley. The MMPI is copyrighted by the University of Minnesota.

The MMPI was designed as an adult measure of psychopathology and personality structure in 1939. Many additions and changes to the measure have been made over time to improve interpretability of the original clinical scales. Additionally, there have been changes in the number of items in the measure, and other adjustments which reflect its current use as a tool towards modern psychopathy and personality disorders. The most historically significant developmental changes include:

*In 1989, the MMPI became the MMPI-2 as a result of a restandardization project to develop a new set of normative data representing current population characteristics; the restandardization increased the size of the normative database to include a wide range of clinical and non-clinical samples; psychometric characteristics of the clinical scales were not addressed at that time.
*In 2003, the Restructured Clinical scales were added to the published MMPI-2, representing a reconstruction of the original clinical scales designed to address known psychometric flaws in the original clinical scales that unnecessarily complicated their interpretability and validity, but could not be addressed at the same time as the restandardization process. Specifically, Demoralization – a non-specific distress component thought to impair the discriminant validity of many self-report measures of psychopathology – was identified and removed from the original clinical scales. Restructuring the clinical scales was the initial step toward addressing the remaining psychometric and theoretical problems of the MMPI-2.
*In 2008, the MMPI-2-RF (Restructured Form) was published to psychometrically and theoretically fine-tuned the measure. The MMPI-2-RF contains 338 items, contains 9 validity and 42 homogeneous substantive scales, and allows for a straightforward interpretation strategy. The MMPI-2-RF was constructed using a similar rationale used to create the Restructured Clinical (RC) scales. The rest of the measure was developed utilizing statistical analysis techniques that produced the RC scales as well as a hierarchical set of scales similar to contemporary models of psychopathology to inform the overall measure reorganization. The entire measure reconstruction was accomplished using the original 567 items contained in the MMPI-2 item pool. The MMPI-2 Restandardization norms were used to validate the MMPI-2-RF; over 53,000 correlations based on more than 600 reference criteria are available in the MMPI-2-RF Technical Manual for the purpose of comparing the validity and reliability of MMPI-2-RF scales with those of the MMPI-2. Across multiple studies and as supported in the technical manual, the MMPI-2-RF performs as good as or, in many cases, better than the MMPI-2.
The MMPI-2-RF is a streamlined measure. Retaining only 338 of the original 567 items, its hierarchical scale structure provides non-redundant information across 51 scales that are easily interpretable. Validity scales were retained (revised), two new validity scales have been added (Fs in 2008 and RBS in 2011), and there are new scales that capture somatic complaints. All of the MMPI-2-RF&#x27;s scales demonstrate either increased or equivalent construct and criterion validity compared to their MMPI-2 counterparts.

Current versions of the test (MMPI-2 and MMPI-2-RF) can be completed on optical scan forms or administered directly to individuals on the computer. The MMPI-2 can generate a Score Report or an Extended Score Report, which includes the Restructured Clinical scales from which the Restructured Form was later developed. The MMPI-2 Extended Score Report includes scores on the original clinical scales as well as Content, Supplementary, and other subscales of potential interest to clinicians. Additionally, the MMPI-2-RF computer scoring offers an option for the administrator to select a specific reference group with which to contrast and compare an individual&#x27;s obtained scores; comparison groups include clinical, non-clinical, medical, forensic, and pre-employment settings, to name a few. The newest version of the Pearson Q-Local computer scoring program offers the option of converting MMPI-2 data into MMPI-2-RF reports as well as numerous other new features. Use of the MMPI is tightly controlled. Any clinician using the MMPI is required to meet specific test publisher requirements in terms of training and experience, must pay for all administration materials including the annual computer scoring license and is charged for each report generated by computer.

In 2018, the University of Minnesota Press commissioned development of the MMPI-3, which was to be based in part on the MMPI-2-RF and include updated normative data. It was published in December 2020.

=== MMPI ===

The original MMPI was developed on a scale-by-scale basis in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Hathaway and McKinley used an empirical [criterion] keying approach, with clinical scales derived by selecting items that were endorsed by patients known to have been diagnosed with certain pathologies. The difference between this approach and other test development strategies used around that time was that it was in many ways atheoretical (not based on any particular theory) and thus the initial test was not aligned with the prevailing psychodynamic theories. Theory in some ways affected the development process, if only because the candidate test items and patient groups on which scales were developed were affected by prevailing personality and psychopathological theories of the time. The approach to MMPI development ostensibly enabled the test to capture aspects of human psychopathology that were recognizable and meaningful, despite changes in clinical theories.
However, the MMPI had flaws of validity that were soon apparent and could not be overlooked indefinitely. The control group for its original testing consisted of a small number of individuals, mostly young, white, and married men and women from rural areas of the Midwest. (The racial makeup of the respondents reflected the ethnic makeup of that time and place.) The MMPI also faced problems as to its terminology and its irrelevance to the population that the test was intended to measure. It became necessary for the MMPI to measure a more diverse number of potential mental health problems, such as &quot;suicidal tendencies, drug abuse, and treatment-related behaviors.&quot;

=== MMPI-2 ===

The first major revision of the MMPI was the MMPI-2, which was standardized on a new national sample of adults in the United States and released in 1989. The new standardization was based on 2,600 individuals from a more representative background than the MMPI. It is appropriate for use with adults 18 and over. Subsequent revisions of certain test elements have been published, and a wide variety of sub scales were introduced over many years to help clinicians interpret the results of the original 10 clinical scales. The current MMPI-2 has 567 items, and usually takes between one and two hours to complete depending on reading level. It is designed to require a 4.6 grade (Flesh-Kincaid) reading level. There is an infrequently used abbreviated form of the test that consists of the MMPI-2&#x27;s first 370 items. The shorter version has been mainly used in circumstances that have not allowed the full version to be completed (e.g., illness or time pressure), but the scores available on the shorter version are not as extensive as those available in the 567-item version. The original form of the MMPI-2 is the third most frequently utilized test in the field of psychology, behind the most used IQ and achievement tests.

=== MMPI-A ===

A version of the test designed for adolescents ages 14 to 18, the MMPI-A, was released in 1992. The youth version was developed to improve measurement of personality, behavior difficulties, and psychopathology among adolescents. It addressed limitations of using the original MMPI among adolescent populations. Twelve- to thirteen-year-old children were assessed and could not adequately understand the question content so the MMPI-A is not meant for children younger than 14. People who are 18 and no longer in high school may appropriately be tested with the MMPI-2.

Some concerns related to use of the MMPI with youth included inadequate item content, lack of appropriate norms, and problems with extreme reporting. For example, many items were written from an adult perspective, and did not cover content critical to adolescents (e.g., peers, school). Likewise, adolescent norms were not published until the 1970s, and there was not consensus on whether adult or adolescent norms should be used when the instrument was administered to youth. Finally, the use of adult norms tended to overpathologize adolescents, who demonstrated elevations on most original MMPI scales (e.g., T scores greater than 70 on the F validity scale; marked elevations on clinical scales 8 and 9). Therefore, an adolescent version was developed and tested during the restandardization process of the MMPI, which resulted in the MMPI-A.

The MMPI-A has 478 items. It includes the original 10 clinical scales (Hs, D, Hy, Pd, Mf, Pa, Pt, Sc, Ma, Si), six validity scales (?, L, F, F1, F2, K, VRIN, TRIN), 31 Harris Lingoes subscales, 15 content component scales (A-anx, A-obs, A-dep, A-hea, A-ain, A-biz, A-ang, A-cyn, A-con, A-lse, A-las, A-sod, A-fam, A-sch, A-trt), the Personality Psychopathology Five (PSY-5) scales (AGGR, PSYC, DISC, NEGE, INTR), three social introversion subscales (Shyness/Self-Consciousness, Social Avoidance, Alienation), and six supplementary scales (A, R, MAC-R, ACK, PRO, IMM). There is also a short form of 350 items, which covers the basic scales (validity and clinical scales). The validity, clinical, content, and supplementary scales of the MMPI-A have demonstrated adequate to strong test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and validity.

A four factor model (similar to all of the MMPI instruments) was chosen for the MMPI-A and included
# General Maladjustment,
# Over-control (repression) (L, K, Ma),
# Si (Social Introversion),
# MF (Masculine/Feminine).

The MMPI-A normative and clinical samples included 805 males and 815 females, ages 14 to 18, recruited from eight schools across the United States and 420 males and 293 females ages 14 to 18 recruited from treatment facilities in Minneapolis and Minnesota, respectively. Norms were prepared by standardizing raw scores using a uniform t-score transformation, which was developed by Auke Tellegen and adopted for the MMPI-2. This technique preserves the positive skew of scores but also allows percentile comparison.

Strengths of the MMPI-A include the use of adolescent norms, appropriate and relevant item content, inclusion of a shortened version, a clear and comprehensive manual, and strong evidence of validity.

Critiques of the MMPI-A include a non-representative clinical norms sample, overlap in what the clinical scales measure, irrelevance of the mf scale, as well as long length and high reading level of the instrument.

The MMPI-A is one of the most commonly used instruments among adolescent populations.

A restructured form of the MMPI-A, the MMPI-A-RF was published in 2016.

=== MMPI-2-RF ===

The University of Minnesota Press published a new version of the MMPI-2, the MMPI-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF), in 2008. The MMPI-2-RF builds on the Restructured Clinical (RC) scales developed in 2003, and subsequently subjected to extensive research, with an overriding goal of improved discriminant validity, or the ability of the test to reliably differentiate between clinical syndromes or diagnoses. Most of the MMPI and MMPI-2 Clinical Scales are relatively heterogeneous, i.e., they measure diverse groupings of signs and symptoms, such that an elevation on Scale 2 (Depression), for example, may or may not indicate a depressive disorder. The MMPI-2-RF scales, on the other hand, are fairly homogeneous; are designed to more precisely measure distinct symptom constellations or disorders. From a theoretical perspective, the MMPI-2-RF scales rest on an assumption that psychopathology is a homogeneous condition that is additive.

Advances in psychometric theory, test development methods, and statistical analyses used to develop the MMPI-2-RF were not available when the MMPI was developed.

=== MMPI-3 ===
The MMPI-3 was released in December 2020. Its primary goals were to enhance the item pool, update the test norms, optimize existing scales, and introduce new scales (that assess disordered eating, compulsivity, impulsivity, and self-importance). It features a new, nationally representative normative sample, selected to match projections for race and ethnicity, education, and age. Spanish language norms are available for use with the U.S. Spanish translation of the MMPI-3.

== Scale composition ==

=== Clinical scales ===
The original clinical scales were designed to measure common diagnoses of the era.

==== Code types ====
Code types are a combination of the two or three (and, according to a few authors, even four) highest-scoring clinical scales (e.g. 4, 8, 6 = 486). Code types are interpreted as a single, wider ranged elevation, rather than interpreting each scale individually. For profiles without defined code types, interpretation should focus on the individual scales.
==== Psychopathic Deviate ====
This scale comes from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2), where 50 statements compose the Psychopathic Deviate subscale. The 50 statements must be answered in true or false format as applied to one&#x27;s self.

The Psychopathic Deviate scale measures general social maladjustment and the absence of strongly pleasant experiences. The items on this scale tap into complaints about family and authority figures in general, self-alienation, social alienation and boredom.

When diagnosing psychopathy, the MMPI-2&#x27;s Psychopathic Deviate scale is considered one of the traditional personality tests that contain subscales relating to psychopathy, though they assess relatively non-specific tendencies towards antisocial or criminal behavior.

====Clinical subscales====
The clinical scales are heterogeneous for their item content. To assist clinicians in interpreting the scales, researchers have developed subscales of more homogeneous items within each scale. The &quot;Harris–Lingoes (1955)&quot; scales was one of the most widely used results of this approach and were included in the MMPI-2 and MMPI-A.

=== Restructured Clinical (RC) scales ===

The Restructured Clinical scales were designed to be psychometrically improved versions of the original clinical scales, which were known to contain a high level of interscale correlation, overlapping items, and were confounded by the presence of an overarching factor that has since been extracted and placed in a separate scale (demoralization). The RC scales measure the core constructs of the original clinical scales. Critics of the RC scales assert they have deviated too far from the original clinical scales, the implication being that previous research done on the clinical scales will not be relevant to the interpretation of the RC scales. However, researchers on the RC scales assert that the RC scales predict pathology in their designated areas better than their concordant original clinical scales while using significantly fewer items and maintaining equal to higher internal consistency, reliability and validity; further, unlike the original clinical scales, the RC scales are not saturated with the primary factor (demoralization, now captured in RCdem) which frequently produced diffuse elevations and made interpretation of results difficult; finally, the RC scales have lower interscale correlations and, in contrast to the original clinical scales, contain no interscale item overlap. The effects of removal of the common variance spread across the older clinical scales due to a general factor common to psychopathology, through use of sophisticated psychometric methods, was described as a paradigm shift in personality assessment. Critics of the new scales argue that the removal of this common variance makes the RC scales less ecologically valid (less like real life) because real patients tend to present complex patterns of symptoms. Proponents of the MMPI-2-RF argue that this potential problem is addressed by being able to view elevations on other RC scales that are less saturated with the general factor and, therefore, are also more transparent and much easier to interpret.

=== Validity scales===

The validity scales in all versions of the MMPI-2 (MMPI-2 and RF) contain three basic types of validity measures: those that were designed to detect non-responding or inconsistent responding (CNS, VRIN, TRIN), those designed to detect when clients are over reporting or exaggerating the prevalence or severity of psychological symptoms (F, F, F, FBS), and those designed to detect when test-takers are under-reporting or downplaying psychological symptoms (L, K, S). A new addition to the validity scales for the MMPI-2-RF includes an over reporting scale of somatic symptoms (F) as well as revised versions of the validity scales of the MMPI-2 (VRIN-r, TRIN-r, F-r, F-r, FBS-r, L-r, and K-r). The MMPI-2-RF does not include the S or F scales, and the F-r scale now covers the entirety of the test.

===Content scales===

Although elevations on the clinical scales are significant indicators of certain psychological conditions, it is difficult to determine exactly what specific behaviors the high scores are related to. The content scales of the MMPI-2 were developed for the purpose of increasing the incremental validity of the clinical scales. The content scales contain items intended to provide insight into specific types of symptoms and areas of functioning that the clinical scales do not measure, and are supposed to be used in addition to the clinical scales to interpret profiles. They were developed by Butcher, Graham, Williams and Ben-Porath using similar rational and statistical procedures as Wiggins who developed the original MMPI content scales.

The items on the content scales contain obvious content and therefore are susceptible to response bias – exaggeration or denial of symptoms, and should be interpreted with caution. T scores greater than 65 on any content scale are considered high scores.

====Content component scales====
The MMPI-2 and MMPI-A included subscales for some of the content scales to further specify the results. For example, &quot;Depression (DEP)&quot; was broken down into &quot;Lack of drive (DEP)&quot;, &quot;Dysphoria (DEP)&quot;, &quot;Self-depreciation (DEP)&quot; and &quot;Suicidal ideation (DEP)&quot;.

=== Supplemental scales ===

To supplement these multidimensional scales and to assist in interpreting the frequently seen diffuse elevations due to the general factor (removed in the RC scales), the supplemental scales were also developed, with the more frequently used being the substance abuse scales (MAC-R, APS, AAS), designed to assess the extent to which a client admits to or is prone to abusing substances, and the A (anxiety) and R (repression) scales, developed by Welsh after conducting a factor analysis of the original MMPI item pool.

=== PSY-5 (Personality Psychopathology Five) scales ===

The PSY-5 is set of scales measuring dimensional traits of personality disorders, originally developed from factor analysis of the personality disorder content of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;. Originally, these scales were titled: Aggressiveness, Psychoticism, Constraint, Negative Emotionality/Neuroticism, and Positive Emotionality/Extraversion; however, in the most current edition of the MMPI-2 and MMPI-2-RF, the Constraint and Positive Emotionality scales have been reversed and renamed as Disconstraint and Introversion / Low Positive Emotionality.

Across several large samples including clinical, college, and normative populations, the MMPI-2 PSY-5 scales showed moderate internal consistency and intercorrelations comparable with the domain scales on the NEO-PI-R Big Five personality measure. Also, scores on the MMPI-2 PSY-5 scales appear to be similar across genders, and the structure of the PSY-5 has been reproduced in a Dutch psychiatric sample.

=== MMPI-A-RF ===
The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory – Adolescent – Restructured Form (MMPI-A-RF) is a broad-band instrument used to psychologically evaluate adolescents. It was published in 2016 and was primarily authored by Robert P. Archer, Richard W. Handel, Yossef S. Ben-Porath, and Auke Tellegen. It is a revised version of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory – Adolescent (MMPI-A). Like the MMPI-A, this version is intended for use with adolescents aged 14–18 years old. It consists of 241 true-false items which produce scores on 48 scales: 6 Validity scales (VRIN-r, TRIN-r, CRIN, F-r, L-r, K-r), 3 Higher-Order scales (EID, THD, BXD), 9 Restructured Clinical scales (RCd, RC1, RC2, RC3, RC4, RC6, RC7, RC8, RC9), 25 Specific Problem scales, and revised versions of the MMPI-A PSY-5 scales (AGGR-r, PSYC-r, DISC-r, NEGE-r, INTR-r). It also features 14 critical items, including 7 regarding depressing and suicidal ideation.

The MMPI-A-RF was designed to address limitations of its predecessor, such as the scale heterogeneity and item overlap of the original clinical scales. The weaknesses of the clinical scales resulted in intercorrelations of several MMPI-A scales and limited discriminant validity of the scales. To address the issues with the clinical scales, the MMPI-A underwent a revision similar to the restructuring of the MMPI-2 to the MMPI-2-RF. Specifically, a demoralization scale was developed, and each clinical scale underwent exploratory factor analysis to identify its distinctive components.

Additionally, the Specific Problems (SP) scales were developed. Whereas the RC scales provide a broad overview of psychological problems (e.g., low positive emotions or symptoms of depression; antisocial behavior; bizarre thoughts), the SP scales offered narrow, focused descriptions of the problems the individual reported he or she was experiencing. The MMPI-2-RF SP Scales were used as a template. First, corresponding items from the MMPI-2-RF were identified in the MMPI-A, and then 58 items unique to the MMPI-A were added to the item pool. This way, the MMPI-A-RF SP scales could maintain continuity with the MMPI-2-RF but in addition address issues specific to adolescent problems. After a preliminary set of SP scales were developed based on their content, each scale went through statistical tests (factor analysis) to ensure they did not overlap or relate too strongly to the RC demoralization scale. Additional statistical analyses were put in place to make sure each SP scale contained items that were strongly related (correlated) with its scale and less strongly associated with other scales; in the end, each item appeared on only one SP scale. These scales were developed to provide additional information in association with the RC scales, but SP scales are not subscales and can be interpreted even when the related RC scale is not elevated. 
As noted above, 25 SP scales were developed. Of these, 19 have the same names as the corresponding MMPI-2-RF SP scales, although the specific items that construct SP scales vary per form. The following 5 scales were unique to the MMPI-A-RF: Obsessions/Compulsions (OCS), Antisocial Attitudes (ASA), Conduct Problems (CNP), Negative Peer Influence (NPI), and Specific Fears (SPF).
The SP scales were organized into four groupings: Somatic/Cognitive, Internalizing, Externalizing, and Interpersonal Scales. The Somatic/Cognitive scales (MLS, GIC, HPC, NUC, and COG) share their names with the SP scales on the MMPI-2-RF, are related to RC1, and focus on aspects of physical health and functioning. There are nine Internalizing scales. The first three (HLP, SFD, and NFC) are related to aspects of demoralization, or the general sense of unhappiness, and the remaining scales (OCS, STW, AXY, ANP, BRF, SPF) assess for Dysfunctional Negative Emotions (e.g., a tendency toward worry, fearfulness, and anxiety). Six Externalizing scales (NSA, ASA, CNP, SUB, NPI, and AGG) are related to antisocial behavior, and the need for excitement and stimulating activity (i.e., hypomanic activation). Finally, Interpersonal scales (FML, IPP, SAV, SHY, and DSF), while not related to particular RC scales, focus on aspects of social and relational functioning with family and peers.

Additionally, the 478-item length of the MMPI-A was identified as a challenge to adolescent attention span and concentration. To address this, the MMPI-A-RF has less than half the items of the MMPI-A.

===Higher-Order scales===
&quot;Higher-Order (H-O) Scales&quot; were introduced with the MMPI-2-RF and they are identical in the MMPI-A-RF and the MMPI-3. Their function is to assess problems of three general areas of functioning: affective, cognitive (thought) and behavioral.
===Specific Problems (SP) scales===
===Interest Scales===
The MMPI-2-RF includes two Interest Scales. The &quot;Aesthetic-Literary Interests (AES)&quot; scale rates interest in literature, music, theatre, and the likewise, and the &quot;Mechanical-Physical Interests (MEC)&quot; scale measures interest in construction and repair, and general interest in the outdoors and sports.

== Criticism ==

Like many standardized tests, scores on the various scales of the MMPI-2 and the MMPI-2-RF are not representative of either percentile rank or how &quot;well&quot; or &quot;poorly&quot; someone has done on the test. Rather, analysis looks at relative elevation of factors compared to the various norm groups studied. Raw scores on the scales are transformed into a standardized metric known as T-scores (mean equals 50, standard deviation equals 10), making interpretation easier for clinicians. Test manufacturers and publishers ask test purchasers to prove they are qualified to purchase the MMPI/MMPI-2/MMPI-2-RF and other tests.

===Addition of the Lees-Haley FBS (Symptom Validity) ===
Psychologist Paul Lees-Haley developed the FBS (Fake Bad Scale). Although the FBS acronym remains in use, the official name for the scale changed to Symptom Validity Scale when it was incorporated into the standard scoring reports produced by Pearson, the licensed publisher. Some psychologists question the validity and utility of the FBS scale. The peer-reviewed journal &quot;Psychological Injury and Law&quot; published a series of pro and con articles in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Investigations of the factor structure of the Symptom Validity Scale (FBS and FBS-r) raise doubts about the scale&#x27;s construct and predictive validity in the detection of malingering.

===Racial disparity===

One of the biggest criticisms of the original MMPI has been the difference between whites and non-whites.

In the 1970s, Charles McCreary and Eligio Padilla from UCLA compared scores of black, white and Mexican-American men and found that non-whites tended to score five points higher on the test. They stated: &quot;There is continuing controversy about the appropriateness of the MMPI when decisions involve persons from non-white racial and ethnic backgrounds. In general, studies of such divergent populations as prison inmates, medical patients, psychiatric patients, and high school and college students have found that blacks usually score higher than whites on the L, F, Sc, and Ma scales. There is near agreement that the notion of more psychopathology in racial ethnic minority groups is simplistic and untenable. Nevertheless, three divergent explanations of racial differences on the MMPI have been suggested. Black-white MMPI differences reflect variations in values, conceptions, and expectations that result from growing up in different cultures. Another point of view maintains that differences on the MMPI between blacks and whites are not a reflection of racial differences, but rather a reflection of overriding socioeconomic variations between racial groups. Thirdly, MMPI scales may reflect socioeconomic factors, while other scales are primarily race-related.&quot;

==== MMPI-2 in Chinese ====
The Chinese MMPI-2 was developed by Fanny M. Cheung, Weizhen Song, and Jianxin Zhang for Hong Kong and adapted for use in the mainland. The Chinese MMPI was used as a base instrument from which some items, that were the same in the MMPI-2, were retained. New items on the Chinese MMPI-2 underwent translation from English to Chinese and then back translation from Chinese to English to establish uniformity of the items and their content. The psychometrics are robust with the Chinese MMPI-2 having high reliability (a measure of whether the results of the scale are consistent). Reliability coefficients were found to be over 0.8 for the test in Hong Kong and were between 0.58 and 0.91 across scales for the mainland. In addition, the correlation of the Chinese MMPI-2 and the English MMPI-2 was found to average 0.64 for the clinical scales and 0.68 for the content scales indicating that the Chinese MMPI-2 is an effective tool of personality assessment.

==== MMPI-2 in Korean ====
The Korean MMPI-2 was initially translated by Kyunghee Han through a process of multiple rounds of translation (English to Korean) and back-translation (Korean to English), and it was tested in a sample of 726 Korean college students. In general, the test-retest reliabilities in the Korean sample were comparable to those in the American sample. For both culture samples, the median test-retest reliabilities were found to be higher for females than for males: 0.75 for Korean males and 0.78 for American males, whereas it was 0.85 for Korean females and 0.81 for American females. After retranslating and revising the items with minor translation accuracy problems, the final version of the Korean MMPI-2 was published in 2005. The published Korean MMPI-2 was standardized using a Korean adult normative sample, whose demographics were similar to the 2000 Korean Census data. Compared to the U. S. norm, scale means of Korean norm were significantly elevated; however, the reliabilities and validity of the Korean MMPI-2 were still found to be comparable with the English MMPI-2. The Korean MMPI-2 was further validated by using a Korean psychiatric sample from inpatient and outpatient facilities of Samsung National Hospital in Seoul. The internal consistency of the MMPI-2 scales for the psychiatric sample was comparable to the results obtained from the normative samples. Robust validity of the Korean MMPI-2 scales was evidenced by correlations with the SCL-90-R scales, behavioral correlates, and therapist ratings. The Korean MMPI-2 RF was published in 2011 and it was standardized using the Korean MMPI-2 normative sample with minor modifications.

==== MMPI-2 in Hmong ====
The MMPI-2 was translated into the Hmong language by Deinard, Butcher, Thao, Vang and Hang. The items for the Hmong-language MMPI-2 were obtained by translation and back-translation from the English version. After linguistic evaluation to ensure that the Hmong-language MMPI-2 was equivalent to the English MMPI-2, studies to assess whether the scales meant and measured the same concepts across the different languages. It was found that the findings from both the Hmong-language and English MMPI-2 were equivalent, indicating that the results obtained for a person tested with either version were very similar.

=== MMPI-3 ===
As of January 2025 the MMPI-3 is available in English, Dutch/Flemish, French (Canada), Japanese and Spanish (US). Translations are in development for Chinese, Danish, French (France), German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Korean, Norwegian, Spanish (Mexico, Central America), Spanish (Spain, South America, Central America), Swedish.

<text>Earl of Dartmouth is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1711 for William Legge, 2nd Baron Dartmouth.

==History==
The Legge family descended from Edward Legge, Vice-President of Munster. His eldest son William Legge was a Royalist army officer and close associate of Prince Rupert of the Rhine. On the Restoration, Charles II offered to create him an earl, but Legge declined.

===Barons Dartmouth===
His son George Legge was a prominent naval commander, who in 1682 was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Dartmouth, of Dartmouth in the County of Devon. George&#x27;s son William, the second Baron, notably served as Secretary of State for the Southern Department between 1710 and 1713 and in 1711 was created Viscount Lewisham, in the County of Kent, and Earl of Dartmouth, in the Peerage of Great Britain.

===Earls of Dartmouth===
William was succeeded by his grandson, the second Earl. He was the only surviving son of George Legge, Viscount Lewisham (d. 1732), eldest son of the first Earl, who had died before his father. He was also an influential politician and served as Secretary of State for the Colonies and First Lord of Trade between 1772 and 1775. The American Ivy League school Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, was named for the second Earl by Congregational minister Eleazar Wheelock.

The second earl&#x27;s eldest son, the third Earl, was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration as Baron Dartmouth in June 1801. Soon after, in July 1801, he succeeded his father in the earldom. Lord Dartmouth held office as President of the Board of Control between 1801 and 1802. On his death, the titles passed to his eldest son, the fourth Earl, who had briefly represented Milborne Port in Parliament before succeeding in the earldom.

The fourth earl&#x27;s only surviving child from his first marriage, the fifth Earl, was a Conservative politician and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire. His eldest son, the sixth Earl, was also a Conservative politician and served twice as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household.

The latter was succeeded by his eldest son, the seventh Earl, who married Lady Ruperta, daughter of the 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire. Lady Ruperta inherited a share of the office of Lord Great Chamberlain from her father, and after his father-in-law&#x27;s death in 1928, Lord Dartmouth acted as Deputy Lord Great Chamberlain until the death of George V in 1936.

The seventh earl&#x27;s only son, William Legge, Viscount Lewisham, was killed at El Alamein in 1942, and Dartmouth was consequently succeeded by his younger brother, Humphry, the eight Earl.

As of 2018, the titles are held by Humphry&#x27;s grandson, the tenth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1997. Lord Dartmouth was a Member of the European Parliament for the UK Independence Party between 2009 and 2019, but left the party in 2018, becoming an independent member.

===Other family members===
Several other members of the Legge family have also gained distinction. The Hon. Henry Bilson-Legge, fourth son of the first Earl, was a politician and served three times as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Sir Arthur Kaye Legge, sixth son of the second Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. The Hon. Edward Legge, seventh son of the second Earl, was Bishop of Oxford. The Hon. Heneage Legge, second son of the third Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Banbury. Arthur Legge, fourth son of the third Earl, was a general in the British Army and Member of Parliament for Banbury. The Hon. Augustus Legge, fifth son of the fourth Earl, was Bishop of Lichfield. The Hon. Heneage Legge, sixth son of the fourth Earl, was Member of Parliament for St George&#x27;s Hanover Square.

===Family seats===
The family seat is Blakelea House, near Marsden, West Yorkshire, though there was also a family home at Sandwell Hall (since demolished) in the Sandwell Valley in West Bromwich, and Patshull Hall, near Pattingham, Staffordshire. The district of Dartmouth Park in north London also belonged to the family, and the family also owned land in Lewisham in south London, hence the subsidiary title Viscount Lewisham.

The INF Treaty banned all of the two nations&#x27; nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and missile launchers with ranges of (&quot;intermediate-range&quot;) and (&quot;shorter-range&quot;). The treaty did not apply to air- or sea-launched missiles. By May 1991, the nations had eliminated 2,692 missiles, followed by 10 years of on-site verification inspections.

President Donald Trump announced on 20 October 2018 that he was withdrawing the US from the treaty due to Russian non-compliance, claiming that Russia had breached the treaty by developing and deploying an intermediate-range cruise missile known as the SSC-8 (Novator 9M729). The Trump administration claimed another reason for the withdrawal was to counter a Chinese arms buildup in the Pacific, including within the South China Sea, as China was not a signatory to the treaty. The US formally suspended the treaty on 1 February 2019, and Russia did so on the following day in response. The United States formally withdrew from the treaty on 2 August 2019.

== Background ==
In March 1976, the Soviet Union first deployed the RSD-10 Pioneer (called &quot;SS-20 Saber&quot; in the West) in its European territories; it was a mobile, concealable intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) with a multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) containing three nuclear 150-kiloton warheads. The SS-20&#x27;s range of was long enough to reach Western Europe from well within Soviet territory; it was just below the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks II (SALT II) Treaty minimum range for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), . The SS-20 replaced the aging SS-4 Sandal and SS-5 Skean, which were seen to pose a limited threat to Western Europe due to their poor accuracy, limited payload (one warhead), lengthy time to prepare to launch, difficulty of concealment, and a lack of mobility that exposed them to pre-emptive NATO strikes ahead of a planned attack. While the SS-4 and SS-5 were seen as defensive weapons, the SS-20 was seen as a potentially offensive system.

The United States, then under President Jimmy Carter, initially considered its strategic nuclear weapons and nuclear-capable aircraft to be adequate counters to the SS-20 and a sufficient deterrent against possible Soviet aggression. In 1977, however, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany argued in a speech that a Western response to the SS-20 deployment should be explored, a call which was echoed by NATO, given a perceived Western disadvantage in European nuclear forces. Leslie H. Gelb, the US Assistant Secretary of State, later recounted that Schmidt&#x27;s speech pressured the US into developing a response.
On 12 December 1979, following European pressure for a response to the SS-20, Western foreign and defense ministers meeting in Brussels made the NATO Double-Track Decision. The ministers argued that the Warsaw Pact had &quot;developed a large and growing capability in nuclear systems that directly threaten Western Europe&quot;: &quot;theater&quot; nuclear systems (i.e., tactical nuclear weapons). In describing this aggravated situation, the ministers made direct reference to the SS-20 featuring &quot;significant improvements over previous systems in providing greater accuracy, more mobility, and greater range, as well as having multiple warheads&quot;. The ministers also attributed the altered situation to the deployment of the Soviet Tupolev Tu-22M strategic bomber, which they believed had much greater performance than its predecessors. Furthermore, the ministers expressed concern that the Soviet Union had gained an advantage over NATO in &quot;Long-Range Theater Nuclear Forces&quot; (LRTNF), and also significantly increased short-range theater nuclear capacity.

The Double-Track Decision involved two policy &quot;tracks&quot;. Initially, 1,000 of the 7,400 theater nuclear warheads would be removed from Europe, and the US would pursue bilateral negotiations with the Soviet Union, intended to limit theater nuclear forces. Should these negotiations fail, NATO would modernize its own LRTNF, or intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF), by replacing US Pershing 1a missiles with 108 Pershing II launchers in West Germany and deploying 464 BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missiles (GLCMs) to Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom beginning in December 1983.

== Negotiations ==
=== Early negotiations: 1981–1983 ===
The Soviet Union and United States agreed to open negotiations and preliminary discussions, named the Preliminary Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Talks, which began in Geneva, Switzerland, in October 1980. The relations were strained at the time due to the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan which led America to impose sanctions against the USSR. On 20 January 1981, Ronald Reagan was sworn into office after defeating Jimmy Carter in the 1980 United States presidential election. Formal talks began on 30 November 1981, with the US negotiators led by Reagan and those of the Soviet Union by General Secretary, Leonid Brezhnev. The core of the US negotiating position reflected the principles put forth under Carter: any limits placed on US INF capabilities, both in terms of &quot;ceilings&quot; and &quot;rights&quot;, must be reciprocated with limits on Soviet systems. Additionally, the US insisted that a sufficient verification regime be put in place.
Paul Nitze, an experienced politician and long-time presidential advisor on defense policy who had participated in the SALT talks, led the US delegation after being recruited by Secretary of State Alexander Haig. Though Nitze had backed the first SALT treaty, he opposed SALT II and had resigned from the US delegation during its negotiation. Nitze was also then a member of the Committee on the Present Danger, a firmly anti-Soviet group composed of conservative Republicans. Yuli Kvitsinsky, the second-ranking official at the Soviet embassy in West Germany, headed the Soviet delegation.

On 18 November 1981, shortly before the beginning of formal talks, Reagan made the Zero Option or &quot;zero-zero&quot; proposal. It called for a hold on US deployment of GLCM and Pershing II systems, reciprocated by Soviet elimination of its SS-4, SS-5, and SS-20 missiles. There appeared to be little chance of the Zero Option being adopted due to Soviet opposition, but the gesture was well received by the European public. In February 1982, US negotiators put forth a draft treaty containing the Zero Option and a global prohibition on intermediate- and short-range missiles, with compliance ensured via a stringent, though unspecified, verification program.

Opinion within the Reagan administration on the Zero Option was mixed. Richard Perle, then the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Global Strategic Affairs, was the architect of the plan. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who supported a continued US nuclear presence in Europe, was skeptical of the plan, though eventually accepted it for its value in putting the Soviet Union &quot;on the defensive in the European propaganda war&quot;. Reagan later recounted that the &quot;zero option sprang out of the realities of nuclear politics in Western Europe&quot;. The Soviet Union rejected the plan shortly after the US tabled it in February 1982, arguing that both the US and USSR should be able to retain intermediate-range missiles in Europe. Specifically, Soviet negotiators proposed that the number of INF missiles and aircraft deployed in Europe by each side be capped at 600 by 1985 and 300 by 1990. Concerned that this proposal would force the US to withdraw aircraft from Europe and not deploy INF missiles, given US cooperation with existing British and French deployments, the US proposed &quot;equal rights and limits&quot;—the US would be permitted to match Soviet SS-20 deployments.

Between 1981 and 1983, American and Soviet negotiators gathered for six rounds of talks, each two months in length—a system based on the earlier SALT talks. The US delegation was composed of Nitze, Major General William F. Burns of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Thomas Graham of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), and officials from the US Department of State, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and US National Security Council. Colonel Norman Clyne, a SALT talks participant, served as Nitze&#x27;s chief of staff.

There was little convergence between the two sides over these two years. A US effort to separate the question of nuclear-capable aircraft from that of intermediate-range missiles successfully focused attention on the latter, but little clear progress on the subject was made. In the summer of 1982, Nitze and Kvitsinsky took a &quot;walk in the woods&quot; in the Jura Mountains, away from formal negotiations in Geneva, in an independent attempt to bypass bureaucratic procedures and break the negotiating deadlock. Nitze later said that his and Kvitsinsky&#x27;s goal was to agree to certain concessions that would allow for a summit meeting between Brezhnev and Reagan later in 1982.
Nitze&#x27;s offer to Kvitsinsky was that the US would forego deployment of the Pershing II and limit the deployment of GLCMs to 75. The Soviet Union, in return, would also have to limit itself to 75 intermediate-range missile launchers in Europe and 90 in Asia. Due to each GLCM launcher containing four GLCMs and each SS-20 launcher containing three warheads, such an agreement would have resulted in the US having 75 more intermediate-range warheads in Europe than the USSR, though Soviet SS-20s were seen as more advanced and maneuverable than American GLCMs. While Kvitsinsky was skeptical that the plan would be well-received in Moscow, Nitze was optimistic about its chances in Washington. The deal ultimately found little traction in either capital. In the United States, the Office of the Secretary of Defense opposed Nitze&#x27;s proposal, as it opposed any proposal that would allow the Soviet Union to deploy missiles to Europe while blocking American deployments. Nitze&#x27;s proposal was relayed by Kvitsinsky to Moscow, where it was also rejected. The plan accordingly was never introduced into formal negotiations.

Thomas Graham, a US negotiator, later recalled that Nitze&#x27;s &quot;walk in the woods&quot; proposal was primarily of Nitze&#x27;s own design and known beforehand only to Burns and Eugene V. Rostow, the director of ACDA. In a National Security Council meeting following the Nitze-Kvitsinsky walk, the proposal was received positively by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Reagan. Following protests by Perle, working within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Reagan informed Nitze that he would not back the plan. The State Department, then led by Haig, also indicated that it would not support Nitze&#x27;s plan and preferred a return to the Zero Option proposal. Nitze argued that one positive consequence of the walk in the woods was that the Western European public, which had doubted American interest in arms control, became convinced that the US was participating in the INF negotiations in good faith.

In early 1983, US negotiators indicated that they would support a plan beyond the Zero Option if the plan established equal rights and limits for the US and USSR, with such limits valid worldwide, and excluded British and French missile systems (as well as those of any other third party). As a temporary measure, the US negotiators also proposed a cap of 450 deployed INF warheads around the world for both the United States and Soviet Union. In response, Soviet negotiators proposed that a plan would have to block all US INF deployments in Europe, cover both missiles and aircraft, include third parties, and focus primarily on Europe for it to gain Soviet backing. In the fall of 1983, just ahead of the scheduled deployment of US Pershing IIs and GLCMs, the United States lowered its proposed limit on global INF deployments to 420 missiles, while the Soviet Union proposed &quot;equal reductions&quot;: if the US cancelled the planned deployment of Pershing II and GLCM systems, the Soviet Union would reduce its own INF deployment by 572 warheads. In November 1983, after the first Pershing IIs arrived in West Germany, the Soviet Union ended negotiations.

=== Restarted negotiations: 1985–1987 ===

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher played a key role in brokering the negotiations between Reagan and new Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev in 1986 to 1987.

In March 1986, negotiations between the US and the USSR resumed, covering not only the INF issue, but also the separate Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) and space issues (Nuclear and Space Talks). In late 1985, both sides were moving towards limiting INF systems in Europe and Asia. On 15 January 1986, Gorbachev announced a Soviet proposal for a ban on all nuclear weapons by 2000, which included INF missiles in Europe. This was dismissed by the United States as a public relations stunt and countered with a phased reduction of INF launchers in Europe and Asia with the target of none by 1989. There would be no constraints on British and French nuclear forces.

A series of meetings in August and September 1986 culminated in the Reykjavík Summit between Reagan and Gorbachev on 11 and 12 October 1986. Both agreed in principle to remove INF systems from Europe and to equal global limits of 100 INF missile warheads. Gorbachev also proposed deeper and more fundamental changes in the strategic relationship. More detailed negotiations extended throughout 1987, aided by the decision of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in August to remove the joint US-West German Pershing 1a systems. Initially, Kohl had opposed the total elimination of the Pershing missiles, claiming that such a move would increase his nation&#x27;s vulnerability to an attack by Warsaw Pact forces. The treaty text was finally agreed in September 1987. On 8 December 1987, the treaty was officially signed by Reagan and Gorbachev at a summit in Washington and ratified the following May in a 93–5 vote by the United States Senate.

==Contents==
The treaty prohibited both parties from possessing, producing, or flight-testing ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of . Possessing or producing ground-based launchers of those missiles was also prohibited. The ban extended to weapons with both nuclear and conventional warheads, but did not cover air-delivered or sea-based missiles. Existing weapons had to be destroyed, and a protocol for mutual inspection was agreed upon. Each party had the right to withdraw from the treaty with six months&#x27; notice, &quot;if it decides that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of this Treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests&quot;.

==Timeline==
=== Implementation ===

By the treaty&#x27;s deadline of 1 June 1991, a total of 2,692 of such weapons had been destroyed, 846 by the US and 1,846 by the Soviet Union. The following specific missiles, their launcher systems, and their transporter vehicles were destroyed:

* United States
** BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missile (decommissioned)
** Pershing 1a (decommissioned)
** Pershing II (decommissioned)
* Soviet Union (listed by NATO reporting name)
** SS-4 Sandal (decommissioned)
** SS-5 Skean (decommissioned)
** SS-12 Scaleboard (decommissioned)
** SS-20 Saber (decommissioned)
** SS-23 Spider (decommissioned)
** SSC-X-4 Slingshot

=== Treaty after December 1991 ===
Five months prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union completed the dismantling of their intermediate-range missiles on May 28 as outlined by the INF Treaty. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States focused on negotiations with Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine to preserve the START 1 treaty that further decreased nuclear armament. The United States considered twelve of the post-Soviet states to be inheritors of the treaty obligations (the three Baltic states are considered to preexist their illegal annexation by the Soviet Union in 1940). The US did not focus immediate attention on the preservation of the INF Treaty because the disarmament of INF missiles already occurred. Eventually, the US began negotiations to maintain the treaty in the six newly independent states of the former Soviet Union that contained INF sites subject to inspection: Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, with Russia being the USSR&#x27;s official successor state and inheriting its nuclear arsenal. From these six countries, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine entered agreements to continue the fulfillment of the INF Treaty.  The remaining two states, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, became passive participants in the negotiations with approval from the other participating states due to the presence of a single inspection site in each country. Inspection of INF missile sites continued until May 31, 2001, as stipulated by the 13-year inspection agreement within the treaty. After this period, the United States and Russia continued to share national technical means of verification and notifications to ensure that each state maintained compliance. The treaty states continued to meet at Special Verification Committees after the end of the inspection period. There were 30 total meetings with the final meeting occurring in November 2016 in Geneva, Switzerland with the United States, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine meeting to discuss compliance obligations.

=== Initial skepticism and allegations of treaty violations===
In February 2007, Vladimir Putin, the President of the Russian Federation, gave a speech at the Munich Security Conference in which he said the INF Treaty should be revisited to ensure security, as it only restricted Russia and the US but not other countries. The Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, Army General Yuri Baluyevsky, contemporaneously said that Russia was planning to unilaterally withdraw from the treaty in response to deployment of the NATO missile defence system in Europe and because other countries were not bound to the treaty.

According to US officials, Russia violated the treaty in 2008 by testing the SSC-8 cruise missile, which has a range of . Russia rejected the claim that their SSC-8 missiles violated the treaty, claiming that the SSC-8 has a maximum range of only . In 2013, it was reported that Russia had tested and planned to continue testing two missiles in ways that could violate the terms of the treaty: the road-mobile SS-25 and the newer RS-26 ICBMs. The US representatives briefed NATO on other Russian breaches of the INF Treaty in 2014 and 2017. In 2018, NATO formally supported the US claims and accused Russia of breaking the treaty. Russia denied the accusation and Putin said it was a pretext for the US to withdraw from the treaty. A BBC analysis of the meeting that culminated in the NATO statement said that &quot;NATO allies here share Washington&#x27;s concerns and have backed the US position, thankful perhaps that it includes this short grace period during which Russia might change its mind.&quot;

In 2011, Dan Blumenthal of the American Enterprise Institute wrote that the actual Russian problem with the INF Treaty was that China was not bound by it and continued to build up their own intermediate-range forces.

According to Russian officials and the American academic Theodore Postol, the US decision to deploy its missile defense system in Europe was a violation of the treaty as they claim they could be quickly retrofitted with offensive capabilities; this accusation has in turn been rejected by US and NATO officials and academic Jeffrey Lewis. Russian experts also stated that the US usage of target missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, such as the MQ-9 Reaper and MQ-4 Triton, violated the INF Treaty, which has also in turn been rejected by US officials.

===US withdrawal and termination===

The US declared its intention to withdraw from the treaty on 20 October 2018, citing the previous violations of the treaty by Russia. This prompted Putin to state that Russia would not launch first in a nuclear conflict but would &quot;annihilate&quot; any adversary, essentially re-stating the policy of &quot;Mutually Assured Destruction&quot;. Putin claimed Russians killed in such a conflict &quot;will go to heaven as martyrs&quot;.

It was also reported that the US need to counter a Chinese arms buildup in the Pacific, including within South China Sea, was another reason for their move to withdraw, because China was not a signatory to the treaty. US officials extending back to the presidency of Barack Obama have noted this. For example, Kelly Magsamen, who helped craft the Pentagon&#x27;s Asian policy under the Obama administration, said China&#x27;s ability to work outside of the INF treaty had vexed policymakers in Washington, long before Trump came into office. A &quot;Politico&quot; article noted the different responses US officials gave to this issue: &quot;either find ways to bring China into the treaty or develop new American weapons to counter it&quot; or &quot;negotiating a new treaty with that country&quot;. The deployment since 2016 of the Chinese DF-26 IRBM with a range of meant that US forces as far as Guam can be threatened. The United States Secretary of Defense at the time, Jim Mattis, was quoted stating that &quot;the Chinese are stockpiling missiles because they&#x27;re not bound by [the treaty] at all&quot;. Bringing an ascendant China into the treaty, or into a new comprehensive treaty including other nuclear powers, was further complicated by complex relationships between China, India, and Pakistan.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said a unilateral US withdrawal would have a negative impact and urged the US to &quot;think thrice before acting&quot;. On 23 October 2018, John R. Bolton, the US National Security Advisor, said on the Russian radio station Echo of Moscow that recent Chinese statements indicate that it wants Washington to stay in the treaty, while China itself is not bound by it. On the same day, a report in &quot;Politico&quot; suggested that China was &quot;the real target of the [pull out]&quot;. It was estimated that 90% of China&#x27;s ground missile arsenal would be outlawed if China were a party to the treaty. Bolton said in an interview with Elena Chernenko from the Russian newspaper &quot;Kommersant&quot; on 22 October 2018: &quot;we see China, Iran, North Korea all developing capabilities which would violate the treaty if they were parties to it.&quot;

On 26 October 2018, Russia unsuccessfully called for a vote to get the United Nations General Assembly to consider calling on Washington and Moscow to preserve and strengthen the treaty. Russia had proposed a draft resolution in the 193-member General Assembly&#x27;s disarmament committee, but missed 18 October submission deadline so it instead called for a vote on whether the committee should be allowed to consider the draft. On the same day, Bolton said in an interview with Reuters that the INF Treaty was a Cold War relic and he wanted to hold strategic talks with Russia about Chinese missile capabilities.

Four days later at a news conference in Norway, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called on Russia to comply with the treaty saying &quot;The problem is the deployment of new Russian missiles&quot;. Putin announced on 20 November 2018 that the Kremlin was prepared to discuss the INF Treaty with Washington but would &quot;retaliate&quot; if the United States withdrew.

Starting on 4 December 2018, the US asserted that Russia had 60 days to comply with the treaty. On 5 December 2018, Russia responded by revealing their Peresvet combat laser, stating the weapon system had been deployed with the Russian Armed Forces as early as 2017 &quot;as part of the state procurement program&quot;.

Russia presented the 9M729 (SSC-8) missile and its technical parameters to foreign military attachés at a military briefing on 23 January 2019, held in what it said was an exercise in transparency it hoped would persuade Washington to stay in the treaty. The Russian Defence Ministry said diplomats from the US, Britain, France and Germany had been invited to attend the static display of the missile, but they declined. The US had previously rejected a Russian offer to do so because it said such an exercise would not allow the Americans to verify the true range of the missile. A summit between the United States and Russia on 30 January 2019 failed to find a way to preserve the treaty.

The US suspended its compliance with the INF Treaty on 2 February 2019 following an announcement by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the day prior. In a statement, Trump said there was a six-month timeline for full withdrawal and INF Treaty termination if the Russian Federation did not come back into compliance within that period. The same day, Putin announced that Russia had also suspended the INF Treaty in a &#x27;mirror response&#x27; to Trump&#x27;s decision, effective that day. The next day, Russia started work on new intermediate range (ballistic) hypersonic missiles along with land-based 3M-54 Kalibr systems (both nuclear capable) in response to the US announcing it would start to conduct research and development of weapons formerly prohibited under the treaty.

Following the six-month US suspension of the INF Treaty, the Trump administration formally announced it had withdrawn from the treaty on 2 August 2019. On that day, Pompeo stated that &quot;Russia is solely responsible for the treaty&#x27;s demise&quot;. While formally ratifying a treaty requires the support of two-thirds of the members of the US Senate, because Congress has rarely acted to stop a number of presidential decisions regarding international treaties during the 20th and 21st centuries, there have been established a precedent that the president and executive branch can unilaterally withdraw from a treaty without congressional approval. On the day of the withdrawal, the US Department of Defense announced plans to test a new type of missile that would have violated the treaty, from an eastern NATO base. Military leaders stated the need for this new missile to stay ahead of both Russia and China, in response to Russia&#x27;s continued violations of the treaty.

The US withdrawal was backed by most of its NATO allies, citing years of Russian non-compliance with the treaty. In response to the withdrawal, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov invited the US and NATO &quot;to assess the possibility of declaring the same moratorium on deploying intermediate-range and shorter-range equipment as we have, the same moratorium Vladimir Putin declared, saying that Russia will refrain from deploying these systems when we acquire them unless the American equipment is deployed in certain regions.&quot; This moratorium request was rejected by NATO&#x27;s Stoltenberg who said that it was not credible as Moscow had already deployed such warheads. On 5 August 2019, Putin stated, &quot;As of August 2, 2019, the INF Treaty no longer exists. Our US colleagues sent it to the archives, making it a thing of the past.&quot;

On 18 August 2019, the US conducted a test firing of a missile that would not have been allowed under the treaty; a ground-based version of the Tomahawk, similar to the BGM-109G banned by the treaty decades prior. The Pentagon said that the data collected and lessons learned from this test would inform its future development of intermediate-range capabilities, while the Russian foreign ministry said that it was a cause for regret, and accused the United States of escalating military tensions.

===Further reactions to the withdrawal===
Numerous prominent nuclear arms control experts, including George Shultz, Richard Lugar and Sam Nunn, urged Trump to preserve the treaty. Gorbachev criticized Trump&#x27;s nuclear treaty withdrawal as &quot;not the work of a great mind&quot; and stated &quot;a new arms race has been announced&quot;. The decision was criticized by the chairmen of the House Committees on Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Eliot Engel and Adam Smith, who said that instead of crafting a plan to hold Russia accountable and pressure it into compliance, the Trump administration had offered Putin an easy way out of the treaty and played right into his hands. Similar arguments had been brought previously on 25 October 2018 by European members of NATO who urged the US &quot;to try to bring Russia back into compliance with the treaty rather than quit it, seeking to avoid a split in the alliance that Moscow could exploit&quot;.

NATO chief Stoltenberg suggested the INF Treaty could be expanded to include countries such as China and India, an idea that both the US and Russia had indicated being open to, although Russia had expressed skepticism that such an expansion could be achieved.

There were contrasting opinions on the withdrawal among American lawmakers. The INF Treaty Compliance Act (H.R. 1249) was introduced to stop the United States from using Government funds to develop missiles prohibited by the treaty, while Republican senators Jim Inhofe and Jim Risch issued statements of support for the withdrawal.

On 8 March 2019, the Foreign Ministry of Ukraine announced that since the United States and Russia had both pulled out of the treaty, it now had the right to develop intermediate-range missiles, citing Russian aggression against Ukraine as a serious threat to the European continent, and the presence of Russian Iskander-M nuclear-capable missile systems in Russian-annexed Crimea. Ukraine was home to about forty percent of the Soviet space industry, but was never allowed to develop a missile with the range to strike Moscow, only having both longer and shorter-ranged missiles, but it has the capability to develop intermediate-range missiles.

After the United States withdrew from the treaty, some American commentators wrote that this might allow the country to more effectively counter Russia and China&#x27;s missile forces. This was later followed by the development and deployment of the Typhon Medium Range Capability weapon system in 2023.

According to Brazilian journalist Augusto Dall&#x27;Agnol, the INF Treaty&#x27;s demise also needs to be understood in the broader context of the gradual erosion of the strategic arms control regime that started with the US withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002 amidst Russia&#x27;s objections.

===New medium range missiles in Europe===

In late 2023 and early 2024, Russia used North Korean Hwasong-11A and/or Hwasong-11B missiles in the Russo-Ukrainian War.

In June 2024, Russian President Putin called for resuming production of medium-range missiles.

Starting from 2026, Typhon missile launcher with SM-6, Tomahawk and longer range hypersonic weapons of the United States will be deployed to Germany. This marks the return of the Tomahawk cruise missile to German territory.

At the 2024 NATO summit, Poland, Germany, France and Italy signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly develop ground-launched cruise missiles with a range of more than 500 kilometres.

France is considering developing a new ground-launched medium-range ballistic missile with a conventional warhead and an estimated range of over 1000 Kilometers.

<text>Earl of Aylesford, in the County of Kent, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. The junior branch of the Earl of Winchilsea and Nottingham. It was created in 1714 for the lawyer and politician Heneage Finch, 1st Baron Guernsey. He had already been created Baron Guernsey in the Peerage of England in 1703. 

Finch was the younger son of Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham and the great-grandson of Elizabeth Heneage, 1st Countess of Winchilsea. Lord Aylesford&#x27;s eldest son, the second Earl, represented Maidstone and Surrey in Parliament. In 1712, he married Mary Fisher, daughter of Sir Clement Fisher, 3rd Baronet. Through this marriage Packington Hall in Warwickshire came into the Finch family.

Their son, the third Earl, sat as a Member of Parliament for Leicestershire and Maidstone. His eldest son, the fourth Earl, represented Castle Rising and Maidstone in the House of Commons, and after entering the House of Lords on his father&#x27;s death, served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1783 to 1804 and as Lord Steward of the Household from 1804 to 1812.

His second but eldest surviving son, the fifth Earl, was a Tory Member of Parliament for Weobly. His son, the sixth Earl, represented South Warwickshire in Parliament as a Conservative. His grandson, the tenth Earl, assumed by Royal licence his grandmother&#x27;s maiden surname of Knightley in addition to that of Finch. His son, the eleventh Earl, served as Lord Lieutenant of the West Midlands. , the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s son, who succeeded in 2008.

The Hon. Charles Finch, younger son of the third Earl, was Member of Parliament for Maidstone. His son Charles Griffith-Wynne (who assumed the surname of Griffith-Wynne in lieu of his patronymic), was Member of Parliament for Caernarvonshire. His son Charles Wynne sat as Member of Parliament for Caernarvon.

The family seat is Packington Hall, in Great Packington, near Meriden, Warwickshire.

<doc id="446197" wikidata="Q7935821" url="?curid=446197" title="Viscount Mountjoy">
<text>The title of Viscount Mountjoy has been created three times, twice in the Peerage of Ireland and once in the Peerage of Great Britain. The creations in the Peerage of Ireland were made in 1683 and 1795, and became extinct in 1769 and 1829, respectively. The creation in the Peerage of Great Britain occurred in 1796, as a subsidiary title for the Marquess of Bute, to which title it is still attached.

The titles of Viscount Mountjoy and Baron Stewart of Ramelton in the Peerage of Ireland were conferred upon Sir William Stewart, 3rd Baronet, of Ramelton, in 1683. His grandson the 3rd Viscount Mountjoy was created Earl of Blessington in 1745 and died in 1769, when all his peerage titles became extinct (though the baronetcy remains extant). His cousin Anne, daughter of the Hon. Alexander Stewart and granddaughter of the 1st Viscount Mountjoy, married in 1711 Luke Gardiner, who served as Vice-Treasurer of Ireland. Their grandson Luke was created [[Baron Mountjoy]], of Mountjoy in the County of Tyrone, in 1789 and Viscount Mountjoy in 1795, both in the Peerage of Ireland. His son Charles John Gardiner, 2nd Viscount Mountjoy, was created Earl of Blessington, again in the Peerage of Ireland, in 1816. His second wife was the famous Marguerite, Countess of Blessington. He died without male issue in 1829, when all his titles became extinct.

Charlotte Jane Windsor, daughter of the 2nd Viscount Windsor and 2nd Baron Mountjoy, married the 4th Earl of Bute, and that nobleman was created Marquess of Bute, Earl of Windsor and Viscount Mountjoy in the Isle of Wight in 1796, in the Peerage of Great Britain. These titles remain extant.

<text>Underground Atlanta is a shopping and entertainment district in the Five Points neighborhood of downtown Atlanta, Georgia, United States, near the Five Points MARTA station. It is currently undergoing renovations. First opened in 1969, it takes advantage of the viaducts built over the city&#x27;s many railroad tracks to accommodate later automobile traffic.

==Geography and location==

Underground Atlanta is centered on the historical railroad gulch, which follows the railroad tracks approximately northwest to southeast, parallel to Alabama Street, between Forsyth Street and Central Avenue. In the 1979 nomination form to establish the Underground Atlanta Historic District for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, the cited area is bounded by the modern-day Alabama Street, Central Avenue, Peachtree Street (formerly Whitehall), and Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive; a handwritten note extends it to a four-block area bounded by Wall St SW (on the northeast), Central Ave SW (on the southeast), Martin Luther King Jr. Dr SW (on the southwest) and Peachtree St (on the northwest).

* The north block (Block 1 of the 2017 redevelopment project) is occupied by Peachtree Fountains Plaza and has an area of , bounded by Peachtree, Alabama, Pryor, and Wall.
* The east block (Block 2 of the 2017 redevelopment project) is bounded by Pryor, Alabama, Central, and Wall.
* The south block (Block 3 of the 2017 redevelopment project) is bounded by Pryor, Alabama, Central, and MLK.
* The west block (Block 4 of the 2017 redevelopment project, although Block 4 properly refers to the eastern half of this block) is bounded by Peachtree, Alabama, Pryor, and MLK.

The four-block site is bisected by Pryor St SW (running from the northeast to the southwest side) and Alabama St (running northwest to southeast). Pryor and Alabama each have two levels; each level has two main halls, which are called Upper and Lower Alabama and Pryor Streets.

==History==

The buildings comprising Underground Atlanta were constructed during the city&#x27;s post-Civil War Reconstruction Era boom, between 1866 and 1871, when the city&#x27;s population doubled from 11,000 to 22,000 residents. In 1869, the Georgia Railroad Freight Depot was completed to replace the one destroyed by Sherman&#x27;s troops in 1864. The Georgia Railroad depot, which stands at the entrance of Underground Atlanta, remains the oldest building in downtown Atlanta. Although the depot was originally three stories tall, the second and third story were destroyed by fire in 1935. Besides the train station, the bustling district included hotels, banks, law offices, and saloons. An electric streetcar was installed in 1889 to points South, and by 1900 the depot was serving 100 trains per day with direct service between Atlanta and New York City; Cincinnati, Ohio; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Knoxville, Tennessee; Augusta, Georgia; Macon, Georgia; and Columbus, Georgia.

By 1910, the intense railroad activity and development in the area led to the erection of several iron bridges to accommodate pedestrian and automotive traffic across the railroad tracks. Atlanta architect Haralson Bleckley proposed to cover over the tracks entirely with a ferroconcrete platform on viaducts in 1909; as part of the contemporary City Beautiful trend, the platform would be used for boulevards and public plazas. Although Bleckley&#x27;s plan was never realized, Plaza Park (in the north block of the four-block Underground Atlanta district) was eventually built in 1948 and later demolished and rebuilt as Peachtree Fountains Plaza.

In 1928, the &quot;twin bridges&quot; viaduct was completed, raising the street level of Pryor, Central, Wall, and Alabama by one and a half stories, and a five-block area was completely covered up. This submerged the original street levels of Pryor, Alabama, Ponder&#x27;s Alley, and Kenny&#x27;s Alley, with access to the original street levels provided from Old Loyd Street. During the construction of the &quot;twin viaducts&quot;, merchants moved their operations to the second floor of their buildings, and turned the original ground floors&#x27; storefronts into basements for storage and service.
Given that this occurred during Prohibition, and the fact that these &quot;basements&quot; were relatively obscured from the city above, some of the basements became sites for speakeasys and juke joints, with music and illegal drinking a common occurrence. One of the first mentions of the area is in the opening lines of Bessie Smith&#x27;s 1927 song &quot;Preachin&#x27; The Blues&quot; which documents its importance as an entertainment district.

For the next forty years, as Atlanta continued to grow at street level, the underground area was effectively abandoned and forgotten, though frequented by the homeless.

===Entertainment district===
In the 1960s, the original storefronts were rediscovered and many architectural features from a century earlier had survived intact including decorative brickwork, granite archways, ornate marble, cast-iron pilasters, hand-carved wooden posts, and gas street lamps. Two Georgia Tech graduates, Steven H. Fuller Jr. and Jack R. Patterson, began to plan a private development there to restore and reopen &quot;the city beneath the city&quot; as a retail and entertainment district. Underground Atlanta, Inc. was incorporated May 2, 1967, and began acquiring options to lease buildings under Central Ave, Pryor, Whitehall, Hunter, Alabama, and Wall Street viaducts. Fuller and Paterson purchased all the corporation&#x27;s stock in October 1967 and construction began in November 1968.

A constitutional amendment was passed in Georgia naming the area a state historic site. The renovation left the original facades mainly intact and was concentrated on the spaces along Alabama, Pryor, and Kenny&#x27;s Alley.
The Underground Atlanta corporation spent $10 million on redeveloping the historic area into an entertainment district. On April 8, 1969, &quot;Underground Atlanta&quot; officially opened with new restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and music venues installed in the old individual storefronts. At the time, Fulton County was the only county in the state of Georgia that permitted mixed alcoholic beverages to be served, provided that adults met a dress code in places that served them. As a result, Underground Atlanta quickly became the center of downtown Atlanta nightlife.

Popular spots in Underground Atlanta included Dante&#x27;s Down the Hatch, Scarlett O&#x27;Hara, The Blarney Stone, The Rustler&#x27;s Den, The Pumphouse, The Front Page, The Bank Note, and Muhlenbrink&#x27;s Saloon, where Atlanta&#x27;s Piano Red, under the name Dr. Feelgood and the Interns, played from 1969 to 1979. Other attractions included a souvenir shop owned by governor Lester Maddox and a wax museum. With the old-style architecture lending considerable charm to the district, Underground Atlanta soon became Atlanta&#x27;s best-known tourist attraction, rivaling Bourbon Street in New Orleans. By 1972, its most profitable year, Underground had 3.5 million visitors and $17 million in sales. In 1973, there were 65 businesses employing 1,000. At its peak, there were more than 80 restaurants, clubs, boutiques, and shops in the Underground Atlanta district.

The heyday of Underground Atlanta lasted for only half a decade. The legal drinking age in Georgia was lowered from 21 to 19. When neighboring DeKalb County relaxed their restrictions on alcohol consumption in the early 1970s, new bars sprouted up in other parts of the city, generating competition. The dress code restrictions were dropped and fights began to break out. Crime became uncontrollable and the area was considered dangerous. In addition, the construction of the MARTA East Line beginning in 1975 tore out approximately one third of the Underground blocks and eliminated parking. 

In 1975, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that winter traffic to the complex was sparse and threatened the continued existence of the district; Underground Atlanta Inc. offered 26,000 shares of stock to the city of Atlanta, and proposed to fence off the district, converting the public streets into public parkland and offering a 25-cent admission charge. By 1976, sales were down to just 40% of 1973 results.
The Underground Atlanta Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 24, 1980, the same year that Underground Atlanta was closed; just 26 businesses remained. Although they struggled to stay open, the area was once again abandoned by February 1982. Dante Stephensen, the proprietor of Dante&#x27;s Down the Hatch, was the last to leave the Underground.

===Shopping mall===
Underground sat mostly dormant for most of the 1980s. Vagrants occupied several of the historic buildings, some of which were consequentially destroyed by fires. In 1982, newly elected mayor Andrew Young vowed to reopen Underground as part of his plan to resuscitate downtown Atlanta, starting with authorizing a $400,000 study conducted by American Cities Corporation (a subsidiary of The Rouse Company, who had redeveloped and operated other &quot;festival shopping&quot; projects around the United States such as Faneuil Hall in Boston, Harborplace in Baltimore, and Bayside Marketplace in Miami); the resulting study advocated a complete redevelopment of Underground and the five blocks surrounding it. Underground Festival Development, Inc. (UFD) was formed in January 1985 to supervise the proposed redevelopment, and Mayor Young signed an agreement with UFD in July of that year. UFD began negotiating with Rouse to manage the site once complete. However, the development was put on hold in December 1985 when the Georgia Supreme Court ruled the proposal, which included a municipal bond issue, first required approval by Fulton County citizens.

Mindful of the security issues (real and perceived) that contributed to the first closure of Underground in 1980, UFD began to plan entrances, exits, and lighting to emphasize safety and Rouse assembled a security force of 30. During this time, some of the clubs that had been destroyed by the MARTA construction eventually won a claim for damages from federal mass transit authorities and used the money to help revitalize the area a second time.

The restructured $85 million bond issue was approved by the Georgia Supreme Court by July 1986, and reconstruction of Underground commenced. The Rouse Company announced it was ready to sign up tenants in March 1987; in all, the renovation cost $142 million. The city of Atlanta contributed $123 million of that, including the $85 million bond revenue, with the remainder from sales taxes and federal sources. On June 15, 1989, during heavy thunderstorms, Underground Atlanta re-opened as more of a modern shopping mall than an entertainment district; the revamped Underground had double the retail space of the old entertainment district, with . Its 140 tenants included the retail outlets Sam Goody and Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s Koala Blue boutique, as well as a reopened Dante&#x27;s Down the Hatch in the Kenny&#x27;s Alley section. Kenny&#x27;s Alley was the designated entertainment area at the modern (post-1928) street level, with available for dining and clubs. In total, the redevelopment project spanned an area of six city blocks, approximately , with parking for 1,200 vehicles. The redevelopment of Underground Atlanta received an award for Excellence in Urban Design from the American Institute of Architects in 1990.

The renovation also removed Plaza Park, which had been built in the late 1940s, and replaced it with Peachtree Fountains Plaza. Plaza Park had been the site of the city&#x27;s last remaining peach tree on its namesake Peachtree Street, but 20 non-fruit-bearing trees were donated by the Georgia Peach Commission to be planted in nearby Woodruff Park.

Although the historic buildings and architecture remained a major draw, some critics felt that the now-sanitized district had lost its original charm and lively atmosphere; Jeff Kunerth wrote the new Underground was &quot;a new heart [of Atlanta] with the soul of Disney World&#x27;s Main Street&quot; in the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;.

First-year sales results were encouraging, with a total of $75 million (exceeding the projection by $5 million) and 13 million visitors, of which 7.8 million were from the Atlanta metropolitan area. The number of visitors from outside the area was the only disappointment. Developers envisioned Underground Atlanta would become the third major tourist attraction for Atlanta, including Stone Mountain Park and Six Flags Over Georgia. The New Georgia Railroad had operated a vintage train excursion from its depot (the former Pullman Yard) near Underground Atlanta to Stone Mountain Park starting in 1986; the excursion train service was discontinued in 1993.

In August 1990, the World of Coca-Cola, a museum chronicling the history of The Coca-Cola Company and its products, opened adjacent to Underground Atlanta, bringing a further influx of tourists to the area. The museum would later relocate to the re-developed Pemberton Place near the Georgia Aquarium. In September 1990, International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch announced that Atlanta had been awarded the 1996 Summer Olympic games; citizens had gathered at Kenny&#x27;s Alley to watch the announcement live on video monitors.

But on April 30, 1992, in the wake of the Rodney King trial verdict, the area was severely damaged by protesters and gangs, leading to the imposition of a curfew. A new marketing campaign which stated &quot;The Fun in Town is Underground&quot; was designed to help its public image. Although the area saw significant attendance during the 1996 Olympics, Underground Atlanta and the Five Points station were evacuated following the bombing when an abandoned bag was found, and Underground still ended the year $6.5 million in the red.

Underground Atlanta was host to retail stores, restaurants, and several nightclubs and bars in Kenny&#x27;s Alley and street battle dancing in the late 1990s. In 2004, in an effort to keep Underground Atlanta from closing a second time, the city passed an ordinance allowing bars in the complex to remain open and serve drinks until 4:00 am – a last call 90 minutes later than the rest of the city had recently been restricted to. Patrons were also permitted to take their open alcoholic drinks from bar to bar. Despite this, Underground Atlanta struggled to attract consistent and diverse patronage. Eventually, Underground Atlanta was closed for a second time in 2016.

===Mixed-use renovation===
On December 17, 2014, an announcement was made by Atlanta&#x27;s then mayor, Kasim Reed, that the city of Atlanta was under contract to sell Underground Atlanta to developer WRS Inc. The developer plans to turn Underground Atlanta into a mixed-use development with more retail options and above ground apartments, with total investments of $150–$200 million. The sale was completed in March 2017, and the lower level closed to the public on August 13, 2017. WRS was better known for developing suburban strip malls, and &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; columnist Bill Torpy was skeptical about their prospects, calling them &quot;an odd fit for the job&quot;. By January 2020, the renovation had borne few visible signs of change.

On November 28, 2020, Underground Atlanta was sold to Shaneel Lalani, the CEO of Norcross-based Billionaires Funding Group (BFG), a private investment firm. Lalani assembled a team of experts to suggest new directions for renovating the site; recommendations included mixed-use development with multifamily residences, expanded retail and dining options, and reopening outdoor spaces. By 2021, BFG had hired Kimley-Horn and HGOR to create a master plan for the site, and several leases were announced in 2022.

<text>The World Poker Tour (WPT) is an internationally televised gaming and entertainment brand. Since 2002, the World Poker Tour has operated a series of international poker tournaments and associated television series broadcasting playdown and the final table of each tournament.

The most prominent of World Poker Tour events belong to the WPT Main Tour. The WPT Main Tour focuses on the buy-in range of $3,500–$25,000, and winners of official WPT Main Tour events are awarded a membership to the WPT Champions Club. The WPT Champions Cup is the trophy awarded to all winners of WPT Main Tour events, and champions have their names engraved on the Cup.

==History==
The World Poker Tour was started in 2002 in the United States by attorney/television producer Steven Lipscomb, who served as CEO of WPT Enterprises, Inc. (WPTE).

Winners on the World Poker Tour are awarded a bracelet, inspired by a similar bracelet by the World Series of Poker (WSOP). While the champions of the first six seasons did not initially receive bracelets, they were awarded them at a special event at the Bellagio in Las Vegas on April 21, 2008. The bracelets are crafted from titanium and diamond by Tiffany and Company.

In November 2009, PartyGaming announced its acquisition of the World Poker Tour for $12.3 million. In 2011, PartyGaming merged with bwin to form bwin.Party Digital Entertainment.

In December 2014, World Poker Tour announced an alliance with Ourgame, agreeing to license products and services on an exclusive basis in more than a dozen countries across Asia. In addition, Ourgame received the rights to use the WPT logo and trademark exclusively in Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Laos, Korea, Nepal, Macau, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines, and Vietnam and operate on pokermonster.com.

In June 2015, The World Poker Tour (WPT) announced that bwin.party sold the company to Ourgame International Holdings Ltd. for a price of $35 million in cash.

In 2021 the World Poker Tour was sold to Element Partners for $105 million.

===Sherman Act lawsuit===
In July 2006, seven poker professionals sued WPTE, alleging violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the California Cartwright Act, and intentional interference with contract. The professionals (Chris Ferguson, Andy Bloch, Annie Duke, Joe Hachem, Phil Gordon, Howard Lederer, and Greg Raymer) alleged that WPTE&#x27;s standard release forms, required for participation in WPTE events, were anti-competitive and designed to interfere with their contractual obligations to other companies. The anti-competition claim was based on the fact that WPTE&#x27;s contracts with the casinos that host its tournaments barred those casinos (and other casinos owned by the same parent companies) from hosting non-WPTE poker events. The claim of interference with contract was based on the releases&#x27; claim to perpetual rights to the players&#x27; likenesses for any use WPTE wished. The players claimed that this would put them in violation of other contracts (such as Ferguson&#x27;s Activision Games contract or several players&#x27; contracts with online poker sites).

Hachem and Raymer dropped out of the lawsuit before its eventual settlement.

In April 2008, WPT Enterprises, Inc. settled with the five players remaining in the lawsuit. Chris Ferguson said about the settlement, &quot;We are happy to have come to an agreement that is fair to all players, and to have put in place a new release that clears up ambiguities in how players&#x27; images may be used. We are especially happy that this new release will apply to all poker players who wish to participate in WPT tournaments and events.&quot;

==Television==
The year-round WPT television show has broadcast globally in more than 150 countries and territories, and is currently producing its 21st season, which airs on FanDuel Sports Network in the United States. In August 2016, the World Poker Tour and Fox Sports (now FanDuel Sports Network) announced a five-year deal to see Fox Sports broadcast the WPT through Season 19.

The WPT television show currently features commentary and analysis by Tony Dunst and Vince Van Patten. Dunst joined the World Poker Tour as host of the WPT Raw Deal during Season 9 after winning the role through an open casting competition. Following the retirement of Mike Sexton from the WPT commentary booth after 15 years, Dunst was elevated into the role alongside Van Patten.

Joining Dunst and Van Patten for all WPT televised broadcasts is anchor Lynn Gilmartin. Gilmartin&#x27;s role focuses on hosting and presenting the show, as well as offering intimate interviews and sideline reporting. Gilmartin assumed the anchor role for Season 12 and remains the current anchor.

Prior to Gilmartin, Shana Hiatt served as the show host and sideline reporter in its first three seasons. Courtney Friel took over the host role for the fourth season, and Sabina Gadecki for the fifth. Layla Kayleigh and Kimberly Lansing began serving as hostesses in Season VI. Poker player and reporter Amanda Leatherman was the host for Season VII while Lansing was on maternity leave. Lansing returned as the anchor for Season 9 through 11.

The first season aired on the Travel Channel on American cable television in the spring of 2003. The show made its network debut on February 1, 2004, on NBC with a special &quot;Battle of Champions&quot; tournament, which aired against CBS coverage of the Super Bowl XXXVIII pre-game show. The Travel Channel aired the first five seasons of the Tour. In April 2007, WPTE announced that the series would move to GSN for its sixth season in the spring of 2008. &#x27;The first WPT tournament to air on GSN, the Mirage Poker Showdown, debuted on March 24, 2008. In July 2008, WPTE announced that the series would move to Fox Sports Regional Networks for its seventh season.

Following the November 2009 acquisition of the World Poker Tour by PartyGaming plc, the new owners added a second series of televised WPT events under their PartyPoker brand name. This series has, to date, focused on televising the European stops of the WPT. Mike Sexton continues to provide commentary, though he is partnered with Denmark-based American commentator Jesse May rather than Vince Van Patten. The role of female show host and sideline reporter has been served by a number of personalities, often from the country where the event is held. One exception is Canadian born poker player Kara Scott, who has served as host for a number of the PartyPoker branded telecasts of these European WPT events.

The show&#x27;s hosts, Tony Dunst and Vince Van Patten, sit at a booth near the final table, providing commentary and occasionally interacting with the players during the game. However, their specific comments about hole cards are recorded after the tournament takes place because gaming regulations prohibit them from observing a live feed of the &quot;hole card cameras&quot; while on the set. These cameras, built into the table, allow viewers to see the face-down hole cards dealt to each player.

In 2014, the World Poker Tour launched a high roller tournament series, WPT Alpha8, broadcasting on Fox Sports 1. The series originally featured commentary and analysis by Ali Nejad and Olivier Busquet, with Gilmartin serving as anchor. In later seasons, Vince Van Patten and Tony Dunst replaced Nejad and Busquet, while Lynn Gilmartin continued to serve as anchor.

The first three seasons of WPT are available on NTSC DVD.

In February 2019, WPT announced a deal with BT Sport to broadcast season XV of WPT. The deal expands WPT coverage to the UK and Ireland. During season XV, former WPT television commentator Mike Sexton won his first WPT event.

In March 2019, WPT announced a deal with TV Azteca to bring WPT assets to Latin America.

==Other Tours==
===Professional Poker Tour===
A series of spin-off tournaments, titled the Professional Poker Tour, began filming in 2004. Broadcast of the series was delayed, which was partly due to a dispute with the Travel Channel over rights. In the fall of 2005, WPTE announced that &quot;a cable channel&quot; (believed to be ESPN) had withdrawn from bidding for the PPT series, and that WPTE was negotiating with the Travel Channel to air the series. On January 30, 2006, WPTE and the Travel Channel announced that they had dismissed all open lawsuits. The series began regular broadcast July 5, 2006, but was suspended after one season as WPTE couldn&#x27;t find a television home for a second season.

===ClubWPT===
In 2008, the WPT launched a new product called ClubWPT. It is a subscription-based club where members can pay a monthly fee to play in tournaments that award over $100,000 in cash and prizes each month.

===PlayWPT===
In 2016, WPT launched a new social casino platform called PlayWPT, offering poker and slots.

With PlayWPT Poker, players can participate in ring games, tournaments, and sit-n-gos, and players can represent themselves at the table with avatars animated emojis. PlayWPT is available on desktop and mobile.

==WPT Player of the Year==
While the winner of the season-ending WPT World Championship (simply the WPT Championship before season 9) is deemed that season&#x27;s WPT Champion, the WPT also determines a Player of the Year to recognize the player who achieves consistent high finishes in WPT events throughout the entire season.

The Player of the Year is determined by a points system, with the player who earns the most points each season being named the WPT Player of the Year. The season-ending WPT World Championship is a points-earning event for the Player of the Year calculation.

Through the end of Season 9, no player has been named WPT Player of the Year and also captured the WPT Championship. The closest to date is Season 7 WPT Player of the Year Bertrand Grospellier, who finished 3rd in that season&#x27;s WPT Championship.

In the first eight seasons of the World Poker Tour, only four players have finished in the money at least once. These players are Phil Hellmuth, Erik Seidel, Mark Seif, and Surinder Sunar.

===Points system===
During the first 8 seasons, only the 6 players at the final table in each Open event, plus the last (7th) player eliminated before the final table, earned points as follows:
* Winner: 1,000 points
* Runner-up: 700 points
* 3rd place: 600 points
* 4th place: 500 points
* 5th place: 400 points
* 6th place: 300 points
* 7th place: 200 points (television final table bubble)

Starting with season 9, the points system was adjusted to recognize the number of entries and the size of the prize pool for each event:
* Generally, 10% of the participants in each event will finish in the money (ITM), so the system now gives Player of the Year points to all ITM players.
* The maximum number of points awarded to the event winner are now scaled to the size of the prize pool, with 600 points to the winner of an event with a prize pool smaller than $500,000 and 1400 points to the winner of an event with a prize pool larger than $4,000,000. The season-ending WPT World Championship, no matter the prize pool, also starts at 1400 points to the winner.
* The system still operates on a descending scale, though the scale provides a minimum of 50 points to all the &#x27;bottom&#x27; ITM players in any event.

==WPT Main Event winners==

==Records==
&quot;Information correct as of May 24, 2024


===Record winnings===
The largest win in a WPT event is the $5,282,954 paid to Daniel Sepiol for winning the season-ending WPT Championship for season 21.

====Progression of largest winnings====
The progression of the &quot;highest payout&quot; through the history of the WPT, starting with the win by Gus Hansen in Event 1 of WPT Season 1. Entries have declined since the poker boom ended, with no increase in &quot;highest payout&quot; for a number of years – the highest has not increased since an event in 2007.
====WPT World Championship ($25,000 buy-in)====
Each WPT season culminates with the $25,000 buy-in WPT World Championship (simply the WPT Championship before season 9). As with regular events, the prize pool has declined since the poker boom ended: participants dropped from a peak of 639 in 2007, to 146 in 2013. The WPT organizers reacted by dropping the buy-in to $15,000 from 2014 onwards, limiting participation to winners of WPT events since the start of the series, and changing the name again, to WPT Tournament of Champions. There has been no increase in &quot;highest payout&quot; since the $3,970,415 at the 2005 World Championship, and the top prize has consistently been under $500,000 since the 2016 World Championship. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the WPT rebranded its World Championship event with a $10,000 buy-in open tournament in 2022 and 2023, hosted at the Wynn Las Vegas. Both events set WPT records in field size and prize pools guarantees, with the 2023 edition prize pool guarantee of 40 million setting a poker industry record and a top prize of over $5 million.
==WPT Ladies==
In January 2008, the WPT announced a set of tournaments for women, known as WPT Ladies. The first season had five events, with buy-ins ranging from $300 to $1,500. Nancy Todd finished first in the Ladies Championship with Vanessa Selbst finishing second. There are currently no WPT Ladies events scheduled.

==WPT Walk of Fame==
The World Poker Tour Walk of Fame was designed to honor those poker players who have played the game well at the highest levels as well as those who have promoted the spread of it through film, television, and literature.

The first inductees were poker legends Doyle Brunson and Gus Hansen, as well as actor James Garner.

In February 2004, the World Poker Tour Walk of Fame inducted its second members at the Commerce Casino in a ceremony before top pros and celebrities in town for the World Poker Tour Invitational Poker Tournament. The induction ceremony was staged on the doorstep of Commerce Casino.

No new players have been inducted since 2004.

==WPT Honors Award==
The WPT Honors Award launched in early 2017, with Ms. Linda Johnson named as the first recipient. Later that year, 15-year WPT commentator Mike Sexton and gaming industry icon Bruno Fitoussi became the second and third honorees. In 2018, Steve Lipscomb and Lyle Berman each received the fourth and fifth honors.

The WPT Honors Award is the WPT&#x27;s highest honor, awarded to members of the poker industry in celebration and appreciation of exceptional contributions made to the World Poker Tour and the poker community as a whole. Presented as determined by WPT CEO Adam Pliska and the World Poker Tour, the WPT Honors Award is given in recognition to those who distinguish themselves by excellence and dedication beyond expectations.

===WPT Honors Award Recipients===
* 2017: Bruno Fitoussi, Linda Johnson, Mike Sexton
* 2018: Lyle Berman, Steve Lipscomb
* 2019: Deb Giardina, Matt Savage
* 2022: Isai Scheinberg, Vincent Van Patten

==&quot;Deal&quot;==
A fictional WPT championship match is the setting for the 2007 feature film &quot;Deal&quot;. Sexton, Van Patten, and Friel play themselves and a number of other poker professionals and poker-playing celebrities are reportedly in the cast. The WPT set was shipped to New Orleans for filming following the season 4 championship.

<text>The Aras is a transboundary river in the Caucasus. It rises in eastern Turkey and flows along the borders between Turkey and Armenia, between Turkey and the Nakhchivan exclave of Azerbaijan, between Iran and both Azerbaijan and Armenia, and, finally, through Azerbaijan where it flows into the Kura river as a right tributary. It drains the south side of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, while the Kura drains the north side of the Lesser Caucasus. The river&#x27;s total length is and its watershed covers an area of . The Aras is one of the longest rivers in the Caucasus.

==Names==
In classical antiquity, the river was known to the Greeks as Araxes (). Its modern Armenian name is &quot;Arax&quot; or &quot;Araks&quot; (). Historically, it was called (, in modern pronunciation) by Armenians and its Old Georgian name is &quot;Rakhsi&quot; (). In Azerbaijani, the river&#x27;s name is &quot;Araz&quot;. In Persian, Kurdish and Turkish its name is (&quot;Aras&quot;).

==Geography==
The Aras is supported by the Kocagün stream, Dallı stream and Orman stream from the Bingöl Mountains on the borders of Varto district merge with it around the Kırıkhan village of Tekman district. It is surrounded by the Aras Mountains from the south. The Aras meets the Akhuryan River southeast of Digor. From Digor it flows along the Armenia–Turkey border, then runs close to the corridor that connects Turkey to Azerbaijan&#x27;s Nakhchivan exclave, and continues along the Iranian-Armenian and the Iranian-Azerbaijani border. The Aras is fed by several major tributaries, including the Arpa Çayı (also known as the Akhuryan), which gathers the waters from the Kars River and Lake Çıldır located in Turkey, the Hrazdan River, which empties into Lake Sevan in Armenia, and the Qareh Sū, originating from the Sabalān Mountains in northeastern Iranian Azerbaijan.

The lowest point in Armenia is a point along the Aras at an elevation of .

==Etymology and history==

In Armenian tradition, the river is named after , a great-grandson of the legendary Armenian patriarch Haik. The name was later Hellenized to &quot;Araxes&quot; and was applied to the Kura–Araxes culture, a prehistoric people who flourished in the valleys of the Kura and Aras. The river is also mentioned in the last chapter of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; VIII, as &quot;angry at the bridge,&quot; since the Romans built a bridge over it so that it is thereby conquered. The river Aras has been associated with the biblical rivers Gihon and Pishon. Robert H. Hewsen described Aras as the only &quot;true river&quot; of Armenia and as &quot;Mother Araxes,&quot; a symbol of pride to the Armenian people.

According to a legend cited by Strabo, in ancient times, the Araxes river in Armenia had no outflow to the Caspian Sea, but spread out in plains and created a lake without outflow.

During Islamic times, the Araxes became known in Arabic parlance as al-Rass (not to be confused with modern-day Ar Rass) and in Perso-Turkish contexts as Aras.

In modern history, the Aras gained significance as a geographic political boundary. Under the terms of the Treaty of Gulistan and the Treaty of Turkmenchay, the river was chosen as the border limit between the Russian Empire and Qajar Iran, as the latter was forced to cede its Caucasian territories to Russia. Because of these 19th-century border changes, one modern, not widely accepted scheme draws Aras River as the line of continental demarcation between Europe and Asia.

In 1963–1970, Iran and the Soviet Union built the Aras Dam near the Azerbaijani city of Nakhchivan, creating the Aras Reservoir. In 1999–2008, Iran built the Khoda Afarin Dam near the historic Khudafarin Bridges, creating the Khoda Afarin Reservoir, and the Giz Galasi Dam 12 km down the river, creating the Giz Galasi Reservoir. Iran and Armenia are planning to build the Meghri Dam near the Armenian town of Meghri.

==Aras Valley==
In 2006, a bird research and education center was established by KuzeyDoğa, a Turkish non-governmental organization for nature conservation, in the Aras Valley at the village Yukarı Çıyrıklı, in the Tuzluca district of Iğdır Province, Turkey. It is one of Turkey&#x27;s two bird-ringing stations that remain active yearly. Between 2006 and 2021, more than 145,000 birds of 201 species were ringed, and 306 bird species were observed at this station. Sixty-three percent of the 489 bird species found in Turkey are recorded at this wetland, making it eastern Turkey&#x27;s most species-rich wetland for birds. The number of ringed and observed 306 bird species comprises 90 percent of the 340 bird species in Iğdır Province, the most bird species rich landlocked province of Turkey. Seven new bird species were observed during the bird ringing activities in 2012 alone, including the raptor Shikra, or Little Banded Goshawk (&quot;Accipiter badius&quot;), which was new to Turkey&#x27;s avifauna.

A Biology professor at the University of Utah and a president of the KuzeyDoğa Society, Çağan Şekercioğlu, appealed to the Ministry of Forest and Water Management to drop the Tuzluca Dam project, which would destroy the wetland harboring bird wildlife in the Aras Valley. In 2013, the ministry granted the site the highest level of conservation status (Nature Conservation Area).

<doc id="446211" wikidata="Q150266" url="?curid=446211" title="Marth (Fire Emblem)">
<text>is a fictional character from the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; franchise, developed by Intelligent Systems and owned by Nintendo. He is the protagonist and Lord class character in the first and the third games in the series, &quot;Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&quot;, and &quot;Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem&quot;, as well as their respective remakes, &quot;Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon&quot; and &quot;Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem&quot;.

Marth&#x27;s first appearance outside of Japan was in the &quot;Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem&quot; OVA. Marth and Roy&#x27;s inclusions in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series is cited as a reason Nintendo started releasing the games internationally, starting with &quot;Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade&quot;. In December 2020, Marth&#x27;s original Famicom game and the first installment in the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series was localized and released outside of Japan for the first time to commemorate the franchise&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

==Creation and development==
Marth was one of the characters created for &quot;Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&quot; by the game&#x27;s designer and writer Shouzou Kaga. According to Kaga, though Marth takes a prominent role in the story, he is not technically the main protagonist, beyond being required to survive in battle. He stated that it was fine for people to see the story as revolving around any characters the player is partial to. During early development, a scene would have depicted Marth kneeling in grief next to the body of his retainer Jagen in a pool of Jagen&#x27;s blood: this was designed to be a symbolic moment of Marth violently coming of age by losing a father figure. Due to hardware limitations, this and other similar scenes needed to be cut. Marth&#x27;s character designer is currently unknown, though the graphics and character art for &quot;Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&quot; was cooperatively handled by Tohru Ohsawa, Naotaka Ohnishi, Saotshi Machida and Toshitaka Muramatsu. Marth&#x27;s appearance underwent alterations for promotional posters, having a slightly different hairstyle and an altered shade of blue for his hair.

Marth was redesigned for &quot;Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem&quot; by the game&#x27;s character artist Katsuyoshi Koya. For the first game&#x27;s remake, &quot;Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon&quot;, Marth underwent a redesign. The staff&#x27;s main aim for the redesign was to make the character look and feel fresh while not straying too far from what fans had come to expect. His redesign was handled by &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; artist Masamune Shirow. He was redesigned once again for the third game&#x27;s remake, &quot;New Mystery of the Emblem&quot;, by Daisuke Izuka. Marth&#x27;s design for his appearance in downloadable content for &quot;Fire Emblem Awakening&quot; was by Senri Kita, the character artist for &quot;Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn&quot;. This, along with other character redesigns featured in the game&#x27;s DLC, was dubbed an &quot;underworld&quot; design. When designing Marth for &quot;Fire Emblem Warriors&quot;, the designers took input from female staff members involved in the game&#x27;s development in order to make him more appealing to women. Director Usuda Hiroya noted that he was portrayed as a gentle character in &quot;Fire Emblem Awakening&quot; and &quot;Fire Emblem Fates&quot;, but adjusted his face and appearance to make him more manly. An interviewer remarked that male fans of the series viewed him as boyish. When adding past characters to &quot;Fire Emblem Engage&quot;, the designers decided to include Marth first due to him being the first protagonist in the series.

&quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; developer Masahiro Sakurai initially wanted Marth to be part of the roster for the original game due to a desire for &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; to appear in the series and to have another sword fighter, but time constraints prevented this. Sakurai felt that Marth contrasted well with fellow &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; fighter Link, arguing that Marth was more technique-based while Link was strength-based. He later added Roy, the protagonist of &quot;Fire Emblem: Binding Blade&quot;, who was based on Marth&#x27;s moveset. The developers of &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; originally intended to make Marth playable only in the Japanese version of the game, but when he garnered favorable attention during the game&#x27;s North American localization, they decided to keep both him and fellow &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; protagonist Roy in the North American and European versions. Sakurai redesigned the character for &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, where he was included as a playable character alongside other &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; protagonists. By this time, Marth had also been redesigned for &quot;Shadow Dragon&quot;, with Sakurai being shocked when he saw it. He commented that, if he had known earlier, he would have incorporated the new design into the game rather than his own. Marth&#x27;s later appearances in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series were brought in line with his design from &quot;New Mystery of the Emblem&quot;.

In the original video animation adaptation of &quot;Mystery of the Emblem&quot;, Marth was voiced by Hikaru Midorikawa, with Ai Orikasa voicing him as a child. Midorikawa reprised the role in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, and his voice lines recorded for the game were reused in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;. Sakurai explained that these lines were reused due to liking his voice lines in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; so much. Due to not being contracted to voice Marth in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;, Midorikawa believed Marth would not appear in it, and remarked that he wished to record lines for Marth in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series again due to his voice being less young and wanting to reflect Marth looking cooler. In the OVA&#x27;s English dub, Marth was voiced by Spike Spencer. His name was localized as &quot;Mars&quot;, which was put down to the vague pronunciation of the katakana of Marth&#x27;s name. Since &quot;Code Name: S.T.E.A.M.&quot;, Marth has been voiced in all of his video game appearances by Yuri Lowenthal in English (except &quot;Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE&quot;) and Hikaru Midorikawa in Japanese.

==Game appearances==
Marth debuted in 1990 with the release of &quot;Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&quot; in Japan. He is portrayed as a well-liked figure in the game&#x27;s story, gaining more allies as he progresses through the story. He is a Lord, a class unique to him in this game. Marth is forced to flee his home kingdom of Altea after it is invaded by a military alliance of humans and Dragons led by the Shadow Dragon, Medeus and the Sorcerer Gharnef. He then goes on a quest to form a rebellion against Medeus, gathering allies from throughout the continent of Archanea such as his childhood friend, Princess Caeda, Jagen, his retainer, Nyna, the last survivor of Archanea&#x27;s royal family and Hardin of Aurelis whom becames co-leader of the league Marth forms. He eventually obtains the legendary items, the Falchion Sword and Fire Emblem Shield, both of which later appear in other &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; titles.

In the game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem&quot;, released on January 21, 1994, and in the 2010 extended remake, &quot;Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem&quot;, Marth returns to his role as the story&#x27;s protagonist. Whilst on an expedition for his friend, Hardin, Marth is suddenly betrayed and his kingdom is invaded. Marth works together with his allies, finding out why Hardin changed, breaking the Curse of the Fire Emblem and facing a revived Gharnef and Shadow Dragon Medeus. In the game&#x27;s ending, Marth marries Caeda and unites the Kingdoms of the continent.

Marth is a significant figure in the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series. Though Marth kills many people as part of warfare, he is known merciful and empathetic even to his foes. Marth&#x27;s good nature often helps him win over former enemies and turn them into allies.

In &quot;Fire Emblem Awakening&quot;, Marth is referenced when Lucina, his distant descendant disguises herself as Marth and, wearing a mask, actively claims to be him until her father, Chrom discovers her true identity. Marth is available as both a paid downloadable content character in the &quot;Champions of Yore 1&quot; DLC expansion, and as two different characters available through the &quot;SpotPass&quot; feature. Marth additionally appears in &quot;Fire Emblem Heroes&quot; in multiple different costumes and variations. Marth took second place among male &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; characters in the &quot;Choose Your Legend&quot; contest in &quot;Heroes&quot;, behind the Gatekeeper from &quot;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&quot;, resulting in him receiving a legendary variant. He had narrowly missed out on entering the top two multiple times beforehand.

Marth returns in &quot;Fire Emblem Engage&quot;, as a partner to the game&#x27;s protagonist Alear. Along with other previous protagonists of the series, Marth is summoned as an &quot;Emblem&quot;, a replica of the original Marth. He fights alongside Alear to defeat the Fell Dragon Sombron.

Marth debuted in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, where he is an unlockable character alongside fellow &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; protagonist Roy. He is an agile character and fights with his Falchion, with the most power being concentrated in the tip of his blade. He has a technique that allows him to charge a sword slash, as well as a counterattack that deals damage back to opponents if they attack him during this technique. He also has a Sword Dance attack that requires specific input in order to have Marth execute each sword slash. Marth reappears in the 2008 Wii title &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, where his moveset was largely unchanged, with the exception of an easier Sword Dance execution and a shortening of his sword. He also gets a Final Smash, an extra powerful attack, called Critical Hit, where he dashes forth and deals a powerful sword blow. This attack is accompanied by a health meter from the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; games and is the only Final Smash in &quot;Brawl&quot; that instantly knocks out its targets. In the game&#x27;s story mode, the &quot;Subspace Emissary&quot;, he teams up with Ike from &quot;Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance&quot; and &quot;Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn&quot; and Meta Knight from the &quot;Kirby&quot; series. Marth is also playable in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;, using his character design from &quot;New Mystery of the Emblem&quot;. Like all other playable characters in these games, he received an Amiibo figure. Lucina was also added to these games, featuring nearly identical moves, with the only difference being that the tip of Marth&#x27;s sword does the most damage, while Lucina&#x27;s sword is more balanced. Marth returned in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; for the Nintendo Switch. Lucina was also included, being given the label of an Echo Fighter, a character closely based on another.

By using Marth&#x27;s respective Amiibo figure, Marth can be unlocked as a playable character in the games &quot;Code Name: S.T.E.A.M.&quot; and &quot;Fire Emblem Fates&quot; using the &quot;New Nintendo 3DS&quot;&#x27; &quot;Near Field Communication&quot; function. Marth also appears in a crossover between &quot;Fire Emblem Heroes&quot; and &quot;Dragalia Lost&quot;.

===In other media===
An anime under the title &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; was released in 1996, adapting a part of the first game&#x27;s plot. Marth&#x27;s name is romanized as &#x27;Mars&#x27; and he is given the surname of &#x27;Lowell&#x27;. The anime ended production after only two episodes were finished. The OVA was released in the United States in April 1998. Marth is featured as a card in both of the final expansion sets for the &quot;Fire Emblem Trading Card Game&quot; along with other characters from &quot;Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem&quot;, and also appears as a promotional card.

==Reception==
Marth has received generally positive reception, identified as the most famous character in the series by &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; and a popular character by &quot;GamesRadar&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot;. A &quot;Fire Emblem: Awakening&quot; poll conducted by Nintendo of America found that Marth was the most popular character among participants. In North American &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; character popularity polls running up to the release of &quot;Fire Emblem Heroes&quot;, Marth was ranked number 6th out of all &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; male characters. &quot;Inside Games&quot; writer Gawai Strings felt that Marth was a particularly important character in the series due to him being the first protagonist of a &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; remake and the first of a &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; two-parter. They argued that he was the face of the series and among the most frequently appearing.

Marth&#x27;s inclusion in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series of video games popularized both him and &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; in the West; it is cited as a reason Nintendo began releasing the games internationally, beginning with &quot;The Blazing Blade&quot;. Series producer Toru Narihiro attributed an increase in reputation for both Marth and fellow &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; character Ike to their appearances in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, adding that their reputations grew beyond the staff&#x27;s expectations. &quot;Die Hard Game Fan&quot; writer Aileen Coe stated that, at the time of the release of the 2003 &quot;Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword&quot;, American fans were expecting to see Marth in the game, believing a character to be Marth due to having blue hair. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; writer Henry Gilbert noted that Marth&#x27;s use of a sword and his blue sword served as an inspiration for future &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; protagonists, including Ike, Hector, and Ephraim. &quot;RPGFan&quot; writer Josh Louis stated that he first learned of Marth&#x27;s existence from &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, remarking how excited he was to play as him in a &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; game with the announcement of &quot;Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon&quot;. Marth&#x27;s Amiibo figure became a rare collectible, fetching prices several times higher than the list price on second-hand markets. This rarity was attributed to its low stock when compared to figures for characters like Mario and Link. &quot;Shack News&quot; writer David Craddock felt that the &quot;mystery&quot; surrounding Marth and Roy in &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; made them more appealing to players. He also felt that there was excitement among fans over discovering a new series, giving them the opportunity to experience new characters, stories, and gameplay.

<doc id="446212" wikidata="Q10863020" url="?curid=446212" title="United States House Committee on Appropriations">
<text>The United States House Committee on Appropriations is a committee of the United States House of Representatives that is responsible for passing appropriation bills along with its Senate counterpart. The bills passed by the Appropriations Committee regulate expenditures of money by the government of the United States. As such, it is one of the most powerful committees, and its members are seen as influential.

== History ==
The constitutional basis for the Appropriations Committee comes from Article one, Section nine, Clause seven of the U.S. Constitution, which says:
:No money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law; and a regular statement and account of receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time.

This clearly delegated the power of appropriating money to Congress, but was vague beyond that. Originally, the power of appropriating was taken by the Committee on Ways and Means, but the United States Civil War placed a large burden on the Congress, and at the end of that conflict, a reorganization occurred.

===Early years===
The Committee on Appropriations was created on December 11, 1865, when the U.S. House of Representatives separated the tasks of the Committee on Ways and Means into three parts. The passage of legislation affecting taxes remained with Ways and Means. The power to regulate banking was transferred to the Committee on Banking and Commerce. The power to appropriate money—to control the federal purse strings—was given to the newly created Appropriations Committee.

At the time of creation the membership of the committee stood at nine; it currently has 61 members. The power of the committee has only grown since its founding; many of its members and chairmen have gone on to even higher posts. Four of them—Samuel Randall (D-PA), Joseph Cannon (R-IL), Joseph Byrns (D-TN) and Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)—have gone on to become the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives; one, James Garfield, has gone on to become President of the United States.

The root of the Appropriations Committee&#x27;s power is its ability to disburse funds, and thus as the United States federal budget has risen, so has the power of the Appropriations Committee. The first federal budget of the United States, in 1789, was for $639,000—a hefty sum for the time, but a much smaller amount relative to the economy than the federal budget would later become. By the time the Appropriations committee was founded, the Civil War and inflation had raised expenditures to roughly $1.3 billion, increasing the clout of Appropriations. Expenditures continued to follow this pattern—rising sharply during wars before settling down—for over 100 years.

Another important development for Appropriations occurred in the presidency of Warren G. Harding. Harding was the first president of the United States to deliver a budget proposal to Congress.

===Recent times===
In May 1945, when U.S. Representative Albert J. Engel queried extra funds for the Manhattan Project, the administration approved a visit to the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge (CEW) (and one to HEW if desired) by selected legislators, including Engel, Mahon, Snyder, John Taber and Clarence Cannon (the committee chairman). About a month earlier Taber and Cannon had nearly come to blows over the expenditure but, after visiting CEW, Taber asked General Groves and Colonel Nichols &quot;Are you sure you&#x27;re asking for enough money?&quot; Cannon commented &quot;Well, I never expected to hear that from you, John.&quot;

In the early 1970s, the Appropriations Committee faced a crisis. President Richard Nixon began &quot;impounding&quot; funds, not allowing them to be spent, even when Congress had specifically appropriated money for a cause. This was essentially a line-item veto. Numerous court cases were filed by outraged interest groups and members of Congress. Eventually, the sense that Congress needed to regain control of the budget process led to the adoption of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which finalized the budget process in its current form.

== Role ==

The Appropriations committee is widely recognized by political scientists as one of the &quot;power committees&quot;, since it holds the power of the purse. Openings on the Appropriations committee are often hotly demanded, and are doled out as rewards. It is one of the &quot;exclusive&quot; committees of the House, meaning its members typically sit on no other committee. Under House Rules, an exception to this is that five Members of the Appropriations Committee must serve on the House Budget Committee—three for the majority and two for the minority. Much of the power of the committee comes from the inherent utility of controlling spending. Its subcommittee chairs are often called &quot;Cardinals&quot;, likening them to the most senior members of the Catholic Church, because of the power they wield over the budget.

Since the House is elected from single-member districts, securing financing for projects in the district can help a member to be reelected as the funds can create jobs and raise economic performance. This type of spending is derided by critics as pork barrel spending, while those who engage in it generally defend it as necessary and appropriate expenditure of government funds. The members of the Appropriations committee can do this better than most, and better direct funding towards another member&#x27;s district, increasing the stature of committee members in the House and helping them gain support for their priorities, including seeking leadership positions or other honors.

The committee tends to be less partisan than other committees or the House overall. While the minority party will offer amendments during committee consideration, appropriations bills often get significant bipartisan support, both in committee and on the House floor. This atmosphere can be attributed to the fact that all committee members have a compelling interest in ensuring legislation will contain money for their own districts. Conversely, because members of this committee can easily steer money to their home districts, it is considered very difficult to unseat a member of this committee at an election—especially if he or she is a &quot;Cardinal&quot;.

In addition, the ability to appropriate money is useful to lobbyists and interest groups; as such, being on Appropriations makes it easier to collect campaign contributions (see: campaign finance).

== Jurisdiction ==
The Appropriations Committee has one of the largest jurisdictions of any federal committee. Under Rule 10 of the House rules, the committee&#x27;s jurisdiction is defined as:
# Appropriation of the revenue for the support of the Government
# Rescissions of appropriations contained in appropriations Acts
# Transfers of unexpected balances
# Bills and joint resolutions reported by other committees that provide new entitlement authority as defined in section 3(9) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and referred to the committee under clause 4(a)(2)

== Members, 119th Congress ==
Resolutions electing members: (Chair), (Ranking Member), (R), (D), (Re-ranking Maloy)

==Subcommittees==
===Reorganization in 2007===
In 2007, the number of subcommittees was increased to 12 at the start of the 110th Congress. This reorganization, developed by Chairman David Obey and his Senate counterpart, Robert Byrd, for the first time provided for common subcommittee structures between both houses, a move that both chairmen hoped will allow Congress to &quot;complete action on each of the government funding on time for the first time since 1994&quot;.

The new structure added the Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, and transferred jurisdiction over Legislative Branch appropriations from the full committee to a newly reinstated Legislative Branch Subcommittee, which had not existed since the 108th Congress.

<text>Decision theory or the theory of rational choice is a branch of probability, economics, and analytic philosophy that uses the tools of expected utility and probability to model how individuals would behave rationally under uncertainty. It differs from the cognitive and behavioral sciences in that it is mainly prescriptive and concerned with identifying optimal decisions for a rational agent, rather than describing how people actually make decisions. Despite this, the field is important to the study of real human behavior by social scientists, as it lays the foundations to mathematically model and analyze individuals in fields such as sociology, economics, criminology, cognitive science, moral philosophy and political science.

==Branches==
Normative decision theory is concerned with identification of optimal decisions where optimality is often determined by considering an ideal decision maker who is able to calculate with perfect accuracy and is in some sense fully rational. The practical application of this prescriptive approach (how people &quot;ought to&quot; make decisions) is called decision analysis and is aimed at finding tools, methodologies, and software (decision support systems) to help people make better decisions.

In contrast, descriptive decision theory is concerned with describing observed behaviors often under the assumption that those making decisions are behaving under some consistent rules. These rules may, for instance, have a procedural framework (e.g. Amos Tversky&#x27;s elimination by aspects model) or an axiomatic framework (e.g. stochastic transitivity axioms), reconciling the Von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms with behavioral violations of the expected utility hypothesis, or they may explicitly give a functional form for time-inconsistent utility functions (e.g. Laibson&#x27;s quasi-hyperbolic discounting).

Prescriptive decision theory is concerned with predictions about behavior that positive decision theory produces to allow for further tests of the kind of decision-making that occurs in practice. In recent decades, there has also been increasing interest in &quot;behavioral decision theory&quot;, contributing to a re-evaluation of what useful decision-making requires.

==Types of decisions==

===Choice under uncertainty=== 

The area of choice under uncertainty represents the heart of decision theory. Known from the 17th century (Blaise Pascal invoked it in his famous wager, which is contained in his &quot;Pensées&quot;, published in 1670), the idea of expected value is that, when faced with a number of actions, each of which could give rise to more than one possible outcome with different probabilities, the rational procedure is to identify all possible outcomes, determine their values (positive or negative) and the probabilities that will result from each course of action, and multiply the two to give an &quot;expected value&quot;, or the average expectation for an outcome; the action to be chosen should be the one that gives rise to the highest total expected value. In 1738, Daniel Bernoulli published an influential paper entitled &quot;Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk&quot;, in which he uses the St. Petersburg paradox to show that expected value theory must be normatively wrong. He gives an example in which a Dutch merchant is trying to decide whether to insure a cargo being sent from Amsterdam to St. Petersburg in winter. In his solution, he defines a utility function and computes expected utility rather than expected financial value.

In the 20th century, interest was reignited by Abraham Wald&#x27;s 1939 paper pointing out that the two central procedures of sampling-distribution-based statistical-theory, namely hypothesis testing and parameter estimation, are special cases of the general decision problem. Wald&#x27;s paper renewed and synthesized many concepts of statistical theory, including loss functions, risk functions, admissible decision rules, antecedent distributions, Bayesian procedures, and minimax procedures. The phrase &quot;decision theory&quot; itself was used in 1950 by E. L. Lehmann.

The revival of subjective probability theory, from the work of Frank Ramsey, Bruno de Finetti, Leonard Savage and others, extended the scope of expected utility theory to situations where subjective probabilities can be used. At the time, von Neumann and Morgenstern&#x27;s theory of expected utility proved that expected utility maximization followed from basic postulates about rational behavior.

The work of Maurice Allais and Daniel Ellsberg showed that human behavior has systematic and sometimes important departures from expected-utility maximization (Allais paradox and Ellsberg paradox). The prospect theory of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky renewed the empirical study of economic behavior with less emphasis on rationality presuppositions. It describes a way by which people make decisions when all of the outcomes carry a risk. Kahneman and Tversky found three regularities – in actual human decision-making, &quot;losses loom larger than gains&quot;; people focus more on &quot;changes&quot; in their utility-states than they focus on absolute utilities; and the estimation of subjective probabilities is severely biased by anchoring.

===Intertemporal choice===

Intertemporal choice is concerned with the kind of choice where different actions lead to outcomes that are realized at different stages over time. It is also described as cost-benefit decision making since it involves the choices between rewards that vary according to magnitude and time of arrival. If someone received a windfall of several thousand dollars, they could spend it on an expensive holiday, giving them immediate pleasure, or they could invest it in a pension scheme, giving them an income at some time in the future. What is the optimal thing to do? The answer depends partly on factors such as the expected rates of interest and inflation, the person&#x27;s life expectancy, and their confidence in the pensions industry. However even with all those factors taken into account, human behavior again deviates greatly from the predictions of prescriptive decision theory, leading to alternative models in which, for example, objective interest rates are replaced by subjective discount rates.

===Interaction of decision makers===

Some decisions are difficult because of the need to take into account how other people in the situation will respond to the decision that is taken. The analysis of such social decisions is often treated under decision theory, though it involves mathematical methods. In the emerging field of socio-cognitive engineering, the research is especially focused on the different types of distributed decision-making in human organizations, in normal and abnormal/emergency/crisis situations.

===Complex decisions===
Other areas of decision theory are concerned with decisions that are difficult simply because of their complexity, or the complexity of the organization that has to make them. Individuals making decisions are limited in resources (i.e. time and intelligence) and are therefore boundedly rational; the issue is thus, more than the deviation between real and optimal behavior, the difficulty of determining the optimal behavior in the first place. Decisions are also affected by whether options are framed together or separately; this is known as the distinction bias.

==Heuristics==
Heuristics are procedures for making a decision without working out the consequences of every option. Heuristics decrease the amount of evaluative thinking required for decisions, focusing on some aspects of the decision while ignoring others. While quicker than step-by-step processing, heuristic thinking is also more likely to involve fallacies or inaccuracies.

One example of a common and erroneous thought process that arises through heuristic thinking is the &quot;gambler&#x27;s fallacy&quot; — believing that an isolated random event is affected by previous isolated random events. For example, if flips of a fair coin give repeated tails, the coin still has the same probability (i.e., 0.5) of tails in future turns, though intuitively it might seems that heads becomes more likely. In the long run, heads and tails should occur equally often; people commit the gambler&#x27;s fallacy when they use this heuristic to predict that a result of heads is &quot;due&quot; after a run of tails. Another example is that decision-makers may be biased towards preferring moderate alternatives to extreme ones. The &quot;compromise effect&quot; operates under a mindset that the most moderate option carries the most benefit. In an incomplete information scenario, as in most daily decisions, the moderate option will look more appealing than either extreme, independent of the context, based only on the fact that it has characteristics that can be found at either extreme.

==Alternatives==
A highly controversial issue is whether one can replace the use of probability in decision theory with something else.

===Probability theory===
Advocates for the use of probability theory point to:
* the work of Richard Threlkeld Cox for justification of the probability axioms,
* the Dutch book paradoxes of Bruno de Finetti as illustrative of the theoretical difficulties that can arise from departures from the probability axioms, and
* the complete class theorems, which show that all admissible decision rules are equivalent to the Bayesian decision rule for some utility function and some prior distribution (or for the limit of a sequence of prior distributions). Thus, for every decision rule, either the rule may be reformulated as a Bayesian procedure (or a limit of a sequence of such), or there is a rule that is sometimes better and never worse.

===Alternatives to probability theory===
The proponents of fuzzy logic, possibility theory, Dempster–Shafer theory, and info-gap decision theory maintain that probability is only one of many alternatives and point to many examples where non-standard alternatives have been implemented with apparent success. Notably, probabilistic decision theory can sometimes be sensitive to assumptions about the probabilities of various events, whereas non-probabilistic rules, such as minimax, are robust in that they do not make such assumptions.

===Ludic fallacy===
A general criticism of decision theory based on a fixed universe of possibilities is that it considers the &quot;known unknowns&quot;, not the &quot;unknown unknowns&quot;: it focuses on expected variations, not on unforeseen events, which some argue have outsized impact and must be considered – significant events may be &quot;outside model&quot;. This line of argument, called the ludic fallacy, is that there are inevitable imperfections in modeling the real world by particular models, and that unquestioning reliance on models blinds one to their limits.

==History==
The roots of decision theory lie in probability theory, developed by Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat in the 17th century, which was later refined by others like Christiaan Huygens. These developments provided a framework for understanding risk and uncertainty, which are central to decision-making.

In the 18th century, Daniel Bernoulli introduced the concept of &quot;expected utility&quot; in the context of gambling, which was later formalized by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in the 1940s. Their work on &quot;Game Theory and Expected Utility Theory&quot; helped establish a rational basis for decision-making under uncertainty.

After World War II, decision theory expanded into economics, particularly with the work of economists like Milton Friedman and others, who applied it to market behavior and consumer choice theory. This era also saw the development of Bayesian decision theory, which incorporates Bayesian probability into decision-making models.

By the late 20th century, scholars like Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky challenged the assumptions of rational decision-making. Their work in behavioral economics highlighted cognitive biases and heuristics that influence real-world decisions, leading to the development of prospect theory, which modified expected utility theory by accounting for psychological factors.

<doc id="446223" wikidata="Q1501275" url="?curid=446223" title="Gene knockdown">
<text>Gene knockdown is an experimental technique by which the expression of one or more of an organism&#x27;s genes is reduced. The reduction can occur either through genetic modification or by treatment with a reagent such as a short DNA or RNA oligonucleotide that has a sequence complementary to either gene or an mRNA transcript.

==Versus transient knockdown==

If a DNA of an organism is genetically modified, the resulting organism is called a &quot;knockdown organism.&quot; If the change in gene expression is caused by an oligonucleotide binding to an mRNA or temporarily binding to a gene, this leads to a temporary change in gene expression that does not modify the chromosomal DNA, and the result is referred to as a &quot;transient knockdown&quot;.

In a transient knockdown, the binding of this oligonucleotide to the active gene or its transcripts causes decreased expression through a variety of processes. Binding can occur either through the blocking of transcription (in the case of gene-binding), the degradation of the mRNA transcript (e.g. by small interfering RNA (siRNA)) or RNase-H dependent antisense, or through the blocking of either mRNA translation, pre-mRNA splicing sites, or nuclease cleavage sites used for maturation of other functional RNAs, including miRNA (e.g. by morpholino oligos or other RNase-H independent antisense).

The most direct use of transient knockdowns is for learning about a gene that has been sequenced, but has an unknown or incompletely known function. This experimental approach is known as reverse genetics. Researchers draw inferences from how the knockdown differs from individuals in which the gene of interest is operational. Transient knockdowns are often used in developmental biology because oligos can be injected into single-celled zygotes and will be present in the daughter cells of the injected cell through embryonic development. The term gene knockdown first appeared in the literature in 1994

==RNA interference==

RNA interference (RNAi) is a means of silencing genes by way of mRNA degradation. Gene knockdown by this method is achieved by introducing small double-stranded interfering RNAs (siRNA) into the cytoplasm. Small interfering RNAs can originate from inside the cell or can be exogenously introduced into the cell. Once introduced into the cell, exogenous siRNAs are processed by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The siRNA is complementary to the target mRNA to be silenced, and the RISC uses the siRNA as a template for locating the target mRNA. After the RISC localizes to the target mRNA, the RNA is cleaved by a ribonuclease.

RNAi is widely used as a laboratory technique for genetic functional analysis. RNAi in organisms such as &quot;C. elegans&quot; and &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; provides a quick and inexpensive means of investigating gene function. In &quot;C. elegans&quot; research, the availability of tools such as the Ahringer RNAi Library give laboratories a way of testing many genes in a variety of experimental backgrounds. Insights gained from experimental RNAi use may be useful in identifying potential therapeutic targets, drug development, or other applications. RNA interference is a very useful research tool, allowing investigators to carry out large genetic screens in an effort to identify targets for further research related to a particular pathway, drug, or phenotype.

==CRISPRs==

A different means of silencing exogenous DNA that has been discovered in prokaryotes is a mechanism involving loci called &#x27;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats&#x27;, or CRISPRs. CRISPR-associated (cas) genes encode cellular machinery that cuts exogenous DNA into small fragments and inserts them into a CRISPR repeat locus. When this CRISPR region of DNA is expressed by the cell, the small RNAs produced from the exogenous DNA inserts serve as a template sequence that other Cas proteins use to silence this same exogenous sequence. The transcripts of the short exogenous sequences are used as a guide to silence these foreign DNA when they are present in the cell. This serves as a kind of acquired immunity, and this process is like a prokaryotic RNA interference mechanism. The CRISPR repeats are conserved amongst many species and have been demonstrated to be usable in human cells, bacteria, &quot;C. elegans&quot;, zebrafish, and other organisms for effective genome manipulation. The use of CRISPRs as a versatile research tool can be illustrated by many studies making use of it to generate organisms with genome alterations.

==TALENs==

Another technology made possible by prokaryotic genome manipulation is the use of transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to target specific genes. TALENs are nucleases that have two important functional components: a DNA binding domain and a DNA cleaving domain. The DNA binding domain is a sequence-specific transcription activator-like effector sequence while the DNA cleaving domain originates from a bacterial endonuclease and is non-specific. TALENs can be designed to cleave a sequence specified by the sequence of the transcription activator-like effector portion of the construct. Once designed, a TALEN is introduced into a cell as a plasmid or mRNA. The TALEN is expressed, localizes to its target sequence, and cleaves a specific site. After cleavage of the target DNA sequence by the TALEN, the cell uses non-homologous end joining as a DNA repair mechanism to correct the cleavage. The cell&#x27;s attempt at repairing the cleaved sequence can render the encoded protein non-functional, as this repair mechanism introduces insertion or deletion errors at the repaired site.

==Commercialization==

So far, knockdown organisms with permanent alterations in their DNA have been engineered chiefly for research purposes. Also known simply as knockdowns, these organisms are most commonly used for reverse genetics, especially in species such as mice or rats for which transient knockdown technologies cannot easily be applied.

There are several companies that offer commercial services related to gene knockdown treatments.

<doc id="446236" wikidata="Q313555" url="?curid=446236" title="Hanno II the Great">
<text>Hanno II the &quot;Great&quot; (, ) was a wealthy Carthaginian aristocrat in the 3rd century BC. He is the most well known political opponent of the Barcid family; first Hamilcar and later Hannibal Barca.

Hanno&#x27;s wealth was based on the land he owned in Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, and during the First Punic War he led the faction in Carthage that was opposed to continuing the war against the Roman Republic. He preferred to continue conquering territory in Africa rather than fight a naval war against Rome that would bring him no personal gain. In these efforts, he was opposed by the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca. 
In 247 BC Hanno conquered the city of Theveste (nicknamed: &quot;Hekatompylos&quot;) after which he negotiated a peace settlement with the Numidians ending Carthage&#x27;s war with the Numidians. He was praised by both parties for the fairness of the treaty.
Hanno demobilized the Carthaginian navy in 244 BC, giving Rome time to rebuild its navy and finally defeat Carthage by 241 BC.
After the war, Hanno refused to pay the Berber mercenaries who had been promised money and rewards by Hamilcar. The mercenaries revolted, and Hanno took control of the Carthaginian army to attempt to defeat them. His attempt failed and he gave control of the army back to Hamilcar. Eventually, they both cooperated to crush the rebels in 238 BC.

His nickname &quot;the Great&quot; was apparently earned because of his conquests among the African enemies of Carthage, and he continued to oppose war with Rome, which would necessarily involve naval engagements. During the Second Punic War, he led the anti-war faction in Carthage, and is blamed for preventing reinforcements from being sent to Hamilcar&#x27;s son Hannibal after his victory at the Battle of Cannae. After Carthage&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Zama in 202 BC, he was among the ambassadors to negotiate peace with the Romans.

<text>Bowling Green is a small, historic, public park in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City, at the southern end and address origin of Broadway. Located in the 18th century next to the site of the original Dutch fort of New Amsterdam, it served as a public gathering place and under the English was designated as a park in 1733. It is the oldest public park in New York City and is surrounded by its original 18th-century cast iron fence. The park included an actual bowling green and a monumental equestrian statue of King George III prior to the American Revolutionary War. Pulled down in 1776, the 4000-pound statue is said to have been melted for ammunition to fight the British. 

Bowling Green is adjacent to another historic park, Battery Park, located to the southwest. It is surrounded by several buildings, including the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House (with the NYC office of the National Archives), the International Mercantile Marine Company Building, Bowling Green Offices Building, Cunard Building, 26 Broadway, and 2 Broadway. The &quot;Charging Bull&quot; sculpture is located on the northern end of the park. The park is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places under the name Bowling Green Fence and Park. It is also a contributing property to the Wall Street Historic District, an NRHP district created in 2007.

==History==

===Lenape site===
Bowling Green was a significant cultural site before European colonization. There may have been a residence for the chief of a local Lenape Native American tribe at the southern end of the Wickquasgeck trail (modern-day Broadway). There was also a large elm at the end of the trail, where the trail split. It is likely at Bowling Green that the Dutch Governor Peter Minuit purchased Manhattan for $24 worth of merchandise in 1626.

===Colonial era===

The park has long been a center of activity in the city, going back to colonial New Amsterdam, when it served as a cattle market between 1638 and 1647, and a parade ground. In 1675, the city&#x27;s Common Council designated the &quot;plaine afore the forte&quot; for an annual market of &quot;graine, cattle and other produce of the country&quot;. In 1677, the city&#x27;s first public well was dug in front of Fort Amsterdam at Bowling Green. In 1733, the Common Council leased a portion of the parade grounds to three prominent neighboring landlords for a peppercorn a year, upon their promise to create a park that would be &quot;the delight of the Inhabitants of the City&quot; and add to its &quot;Beauty and Ornament&quot;; the improvements were to include a &quot;bowling green&quot; with &quot;walks therein&quot;. The surrounding streets were not paved with cobblestones until 1744.

On August 21, 1770, the British government erected a gilded lead equestrian statue of King George III in Bowling Green; the King was dressed in Roman garb in the style of the &quot;Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius&quot;. The statue had been commissioned in 1766, along with a statue of William Pitt, from the prominent London sculptor Joseph Wilton, as a celebration of victory after the Seven Years&#x27; War. With the rapid deterioration of relations with the mother country after 1770, the statue became a magnet for the Bowling Green protests. In 1773, the city passed an anti-graffiti and anti-desecration law to counter vandalism against the monument, and a protective cast-iron fence was built along the perimeter of the park; the fence is still extant, making it the city&#x27;s oldest fence.

On July 9, 1776, after the Declaration of Independence was read to Washington&#x27;s troops at the current site of City Hall, local Sons of Liberty rushed down Broadway to Bowling Green to topple the statue of King George III; in the process, finials on the tops of the fence depicting the royal symbol of a crown were sawed off. The event is one of the most enduring images in the city&#x27;s history. According to folklore, the statue was chopped up and shipped to a Connecticut foundry under the direction of Oliver Wolcott to be made into 42,088 patriot bullets at 20 bullets per pound (2,104.4 pounds). The statue&#x27;s head was to have been paraded about town on pike-staffs but was recovered by Loyalists and sent to England. Eight pieces of the lead statue are preserved at the New-York Historical Society, one is in the Museum of the City of New York, and one is in Connecticut. (estimated total of 260–270 pounds); In 1991 the left hand and forearm of the statue was found in Wilton Connecticut; likewise 9 lead musket balls from the Monmouth Battlefield had the same lead content as the statue The stone slab on which the statue rested was used as a gravestone before becoming part of the collection of the New-York Historical Society; the stone pedestal itself remained until it was torn down. The event has been depicted over the years in several works of art, including an 1854 painting by William Walcutt, and an 1859 painting by Johannes Adam Simon Oertel.

On November 25, 1783, a U.S. soldier managed to rip down the British flag at Bowling Green and replace it with the Stars and Stripes—an apparently difficult feat, since the British had greased the flagpole. As the defeated British military boarded ships back to England, then-General George Washington triumphantly led the Continental Army through Manhattan down to Bowling Green to witness the last British troops sailing away from Lower Manhattan.

===Postcolonial era===
The marble slab of the statue&#x27;s pedestal was first used as the tombstone of a Major John Smith of the Black Watch, who died in 1783 and was buried at a burial ground across the Hudson River at Paulus Hook in what is now Jersey City, New Jersey. When Smith&#x27;s grave site was leveled in 1804, the slab became a stone step at two successive mansions in Jersey City. The latter was the Van Vorst Mansion that was owned by Cornelius Van Vorst where the stone remained from 1854 to 1874. In 1880 the inscription was rediscovered, and the slab was transferred to the New-York Historical Society. The monument base can be seen in the background of the portrait of George Washington painted by John Trumbull in 1790, now sited in City Hall. The William Pitt statue is in the New-York Historical Society.

Following the Revolution, the remains of Fort Amsterdam facing Bowling Green were demolished in 1790 and part of the rubble used to extend Battery Park to the west. In its place a grand Government House was built, suitable, it was hoped, for a president&#x27;s house, with a four-columned portico facing across Bowling Green and up Broadway. Governor John Jay later inhabited it. When the state capital was moved to Albany, the building served as a boarding house and then the custom house before being demolished in 1815. Elegant townhouses were built around the park which remained largely the private domain of the residents, though now some of the Tory patricians of New York were replaced by Republican ones; leading New York merchants, led by Abraham Kennedy, in a mansion at 1 Broadway that had a facade under a central pediment and a front towards the Battery Parade, as the new piece of open ground was called. The Hon. John Watts, whose summer place was Rose Hill; Chancellor Robert Livingston at number 5, Stephen Whitney at number 7, and John Stevens all constructed brick residences in Federal style facing Bowling Green. The Alexander Macomb House, the second Presidential Mansion, stood north of the park at 39–41 Broadway. President George Washington occupied it from February 23 to August 30, 1790, before the U.S. capital was moved to Philadelphia.

In 1825, Bowling Green Park was &quot;laid down in grass&quot;. At the time, it was an ellipse with a diameter of on the north–south axis and on the east–west axis. By 1850, with the opening of Lafayette Street and the subsequent completions of Washington Square Park and Fifth Avenue, the general northward migration of residences in Manhattan led to the conversion of the residences into shipping offices, resulting in full public access to the park.

===20th and 21st centuries===
The park was described in 1926 as having &quot;walks, benches, sumac trees and poorly-kept &quot;[sic]&quot; lawns&quot;, as well as a fountain in the center used by local children to cool off in the summer. It suffered neglect after World War II. Starting in 1972, the city renovated Bowling Green to restore its 17th-century character. In conjunction with the park&#x27;s renovation, the Bowling Green subway station underneath the park was expanded, necessitating the temporary excavation of the park. The renovation faced a lack of funds during the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis but was completed in the late 1970s.

The Bowling Green Fence and Park were listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1980. In 1982, the Irish Institute of New York installed a plaque in the park commemorating an important religious liberty challenge which occurred in colonial Manhattan in 1707, when Reverend Francis Makemie, the founder of American Presbyterianism, preached at a home near the park in defiance of the orders of Lord Cornbury, and was subsequently arrested, charged with preaching a &quot;pernicious doctrine&quot;, and later acquitted.

In 1989, the sculpture &quot;Charging Bull&quot; by Arturo Di Modica was installed at the northern tip of the park by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation after it had been confiscated by the police following its illegal installation on Wall Street. The sculpture has become one of the most popular and recognizable landmarks of the Financial District. In March 2017, Bowling Green was co-named Evacuation Day Plaza, which was marked by the erection of an illuminated street sign, commemorating the location of a pivotal event in the American Revolutionary War that ended a seven-year occupation by British troops.

==Description and surroundings==
The park is a teardrop-shaped plaza formed by the branching of Broadway as it nears Whitehall Street. It has a fenced-in grassy area with a large fountain in the center, surrounded by benches that are popular at lunchtime with workers from the nearby Financial District.

The south end of the plaza is bounded by the front entrance of the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, which houses the George Gustav Heye Center for the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of the American Indian and the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan Division). Previously there was a public street along the south edge of the park, also called &quot;Bowling Green&quot;, but since this area was needed for a modern entrance to the park&#x27;s eponymous subway station, the road was eliminated and paved over with cobblestones. The New York City Subway station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, opened in 1905 and serving the , is located under the plaza. Entrances dating from both 1905 and more recent renovations are located in and near the plaza.

The urban value of the space is created by the skyscrapers and other structures that surround it (listed clockwise from the south):
* Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House
* International Mercantile Marine Company Building, 1 Broadway (1882–1884, Edward H. Kendall; expanded 1921, Walter B. Chambers), the United States Lines-Panama Pacific Line Building
* Bowling Green Offices Building, 11 Broadway (1895–1898, W. and G. Audsley, later serving the White Star Line)
* Cunard Building, 25 Broadway (1921, Benjamin Wistar Morris, with Carrère and Hastings)
* 26 Broadway, the Standard Oil Company Building, on the east side of Broadway, facing the Cunard Building (1922, Carrère and Hastings with Shreve, Lamb &amp; Blake)
* 2 Broadway (1959–1960, Emery Roth &amp; Sons, resurfaced in 1999 Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill), a Modernist glass wall that replaced the distinguished Produce Exchange Building (1881–1884, George B. Post), as an &quot;acceptable sacrifice&quot; intended to spur financial district rebuilding

=== Fence ===
The fence surrounding Bowling Green Park was erected in 1773 to protect the equestrian statue of King George III. It still stands as the oldest fence in New York City. The fence was originally designed by Richard Sharpe, Peter T. Curtenius, Gilbert Forbes, and Andrew Lyall, and was erected at a cost of 843 New York pounds (£562 sterling). It is made of wrought iron on a stone base. Each fence post once had a finial at its top, which in turn was once adorned with lamps.

The cast-iron finials on the fence were sawed off on July 9, 1776, the day that the United States Declaration of Independence reached New York. The finials were restored in 1786; the saw marks remain visible today. In 1791, the fence and stone base were raised by . The fence was relocated to Central Park between 1914 and 1919 to make way for the construction of the Bowling Green subway station. It was repaired again during the park&#x27;s 1970s renovation. The fence was designated an official city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1970.

===Sculptures===
&quot;Charging Bull&quot;, a bronze sculpture in Bowling Green, designed by Arturo Di Modica and installed in 1989, stands tall and measures long. The oversize sculpture depicts a bull, the symbol of aggressive financial optimism and prosperity, leaning back on its haunches with its head lowered as if ready to charge. The sculpture is a popular tourist destination drawing thousands of people a day, as well as &quot;one of the most iconic images of New York&quot;, and a &quot;Wall Street icon&quot;.

In 2017, another bronze sculpture, &quot;Fearless Girl&quot;, was installed across from the bull. Designed by sculptor Kristen Visbal, the work was hailed for its feminist message. The &quot;Fearless Girl&quot; statue, commissioned by State Street Global Advisors as a way to call attention to the gender pay gap and a lack of women on corporate financial sector boards, was installed on March 7, 2017. The statue depicts a defiant little girl posing as an affront to and staring down &quot;Charging Bull&quot;. The statue was initially scheduled to be removed April 2, 2017, but was later allowed to remain in place through February 2018. The statue was removed in November 2018 and relocated to a site facing the New York Stock Exchange Building.

On May 29, 2017, artist Alex Gardega added a statue of a small dog, titled &quot;Pissing Pug&quot; (alternatively &quot;Peeing Pug&quot; or &quot;Sketchy Dog&quot;), but he removed it after approximately three hours. He described the &quot;Fearless Girl&quot; statue as &quot;corporate nonsense&quot; and &quot;disrespect to the artist that made the bull&quot;.

<text>An involucrum (plural involucra) is a layer of new bone growth outside existing bone.

There are two main contexts:
* In pyogenic osteomyelitis where it is a layer of living bone that has formed around dead bone. It can be identified by radiographically (i.e., with x-rays).
* In cetaceans such as whales, it is a thick covering of bone over the middle-ear space.

<doc id="446250" wikidata="Q6779463" url="?curid=446250" title="Mary Ellen Withrow">
<text>Mary Ellen Hinamon Withrow (born October 2, 1930) is an American activist and former politician who served as the 40th Treasurer of the United States from March 1, 1994 to January 20, 2001 under President Bill Clinton.

She also was Treasurer when the $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 notes were redesigned in the 1990s.

== Biography ==
A native of Marion County, Ohio, Withrow served as the treasurer of her home state of Ohio, a position to which she was elected in 1982, 1986, and 1990. Before that, she was elected Treasurer of her native Marion County, Ohio in 1976 and 1980. This makes her the only person to have held the post of treasurer at all three levels of government — local, state and national.

Withrow began her career in public service in 1969 as the first woman elected to the Elgin Local School Board in Marion County. As Ohio&#x27;s Treasurer, Withrow instituted new programs, achieved record earnings, and was nationally recognized for her efficient management. Withrow was a Presidential Elector for Ohio in 1992 and a delegate to the 2000 Democratic National Convention from Ohio. She again served as a member of the Ohio delegation at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.

==Recognition==

Withrow is the recipient of numerous honors, including the Donald L. Scantlebury Memorial Award from the Treasury&#x27;s Joint Financial Management Improvement Program for financial excellence and improvement in government, and the nation&#x27;s &quot;Most Valuable State Public Official&quot; by City &amp; State Newspaper in 1990.

She has been the president of several Treasury-related associations, including the National Association of State Treasurers, and the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers.

==Activism==
Withrow is an activist for women in government and is a member of the board of directors of Women Executives in State Government, an inductee into the Ohio Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame and a recipient of a Women Executives in State Government fellowship to Harvard University. Following her retirement from office in January 2001, Withrow became active in the US Treasury&#x27;s historical society. Withrow&#x27;s collection of personal documents, photographs, awards and personal papers are housed at the Marion County Historical Society, Marion, Ohio. She has appeared in television ads supporting Ohio&#x27;s Issue 3 casino proposal. She is also quoted extensively in newspaper advertisements and direct mailings of by Federated Mint LLC and Lincoln Treasury. These advertisements use her former title to give legitimacy to questionable items.

==Legacy==
Marion City Schools announced in September 2019 that it would be naming two new schools after Withrow - Mary Ellen Withrow Middle School Academy and the Mary Ellen Withrow High School Academy.

<doc id="446252" wikidata="Q1129338" url="?curid=446252" title="Granuloma">
<text>A granuloma is an aggregation of macrophages (along with other cells) that forms in response to chronic inflammation. This occurs when the immune system attempts to isolate foreign substances that it is otherwise unable to eliminate. Such substances include infectious organisms including bacteria and fungi, as well as other materials such as foreign objects, keratin, and suture fragments.

==Definition==
In pathology, a granuloma is an organized collection of macrophages.

In medical practice, doctors occasionally use the term &quot;granuloma&quot; in its more literal meaning: &quot;a small nodule&quot;. Since a small nodule can represent any tissue from a harmless nevus to a malignant tumor, this use of the term is not very specific. Examples of this use of the term &quot;granuloma&quot; are the lesions known as vocal cord granuloma (known as contact granuloma), pyogenic granuloma, and intubation granuloma, all of which are examples of granulation tissue, not granulomas. &quot;Pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma&quot; is a lesion characterized by keloid-like fibrosis in the lung and is not granulomatous. Similarly, radiologists often use the term &quot;granuloma&quot; when they see a calcified nodule on X-ray or CT scan of the chest. They make this assumption since granulomas usually contain calcium, although the cells that form a granuloma are too tiny to be seen by a radiologist. The most accurate use of the term &quot;granuloma&quot; requires a pathologist to examine surgically removed and specially colored (stained) tissue under a microscope.

Macrophages (specifically histiocytes) are the cells that define a granuloma. They often fuse to form multinucleated giant cells (Langhans giant cell). The macrophages in granulomas are often referred to as &quot;epithelioid&quot;. This term refers to the vague resemblance of these macrophages to epithelial cells. Epithelioid macrophages differ from ordinary macrophages in that they have elongated nuclei that often resemble the sole of a slipper or shoe. They also have larger nuclei than ordinary macrophages, and their cytoplasm is typically pinker when stained with eosin. These changes are thought to be a consequence of &quot;activation&quot; of the macrophage by the offending antigen.

The other key term in the above definition is the word &quot;organized&quot; which refers to a tight, ball-like formation. The macrophages in these formations are typically so tightly clustered that the borders of individual cells are difficult to appreciate. Loosely dispersed macrophages are not considered to be granulomas.

All granulomas, regardless of cause, may contain additional cells and matrix. These include lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, multinucleated giant cells, fibroblasts, and collagen (fibrosis). The additional cells are sometimes a clue to the cause of the granuloma. For example, granulomas with numerous eosinophils may be a clue to coccidioidomycosis or allergic bronchopulmonary fungal disease, and granulomas with numerous neutrophils suggest blastomycosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, aspiration pneumonia, or cat-scratch disease.

In terms of the underlying cause, the difference between granulomas and other types of inflammation is that granulomas form in response to antigens that are resistant to &quot;first-responder&quot; inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and eosinophils. The antigen causing the formation of a granuloma is most often an infectious pathogen or a substance foreign to the body, but sometimes the offending antigen is unknown (as in sarcoidosis).

Granulomas are seen in a wide variety of diseases, both infectious and noninfectious. Infections characterized by granulomas include tuberculosis, leprosy, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, and cat-scratch disease. Examples of noninfectious granulomatous diseases are sarcoidosis, Crohn&#x27;s disease, berylliosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, pulmonary rheumatoid nodules, and aspiration of food and other particulate material into the lung.

===Caseating vs non-caseating===
An important feature of granulomas is whether or not they contain necrosis, which refers to dead cells that, under the microscope, appear as a mass of formless debris with no nuclei present. A related term, &quot;caseation&quot; (literally: &quot;turning to cheese&quot;) refers to a form of necrosis that, to the unaided eye, appears cheese-like (&quot;caseous&quot;), and is typically a feature of the granulomas of tuberculosis. The identification of necrosis in granulomas is important because granulomas with necrosis tend to have infectious causes. Several exceptions to this general rule exist, but it nevertheless remains useful in day-to-day diagnostic pathology.

==Diseases with granulomas==
===Tuberculosis===
&quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; can cause the granulomas of tuberculosis which tend to contain necrosis (&quot;caseating tubercules&quot;), but non-necrotizing granulomas may also be present. Multinucleated giant cells with nuclei arranged like a horseshoe (Langhans giant cell) and foreign body giant cells are often present, but are not specific for tuberculosis. A definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis requires identification of the causative organism by microbiologic cultures.

===Leprosy===
In leprosy, granulomas are found in the skin and tend to involve nerves. The appearance of the granulomas differs according to the precise type of leprosy.

===Aquarium granuloma===
The other &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; species, &quot;Mycobacterium marinum&quot;, can cause a rare infection known as &quot;aquarium granuloma&quot;.

===Schistosomiasis===
Some schistosome ova that are laid in intestinal and urinary venules backwash into the liver via the portal vein, causing granuloma formation in the liver.

===Histoplasmosis===
Granulomas are seen in most forms of histoplasmosis (acute histoplasmosis, histoplasmoma, chronic histoplasmosis). &quot;Histoplasma&quot; organisms can sometimes be demonstrated within the granulomas by biopsy or microbiological cultures.

===Cryptococcosis===
When &quot;Cryptococcus&quot; infection occurs in persons whose immune systems are intact, granulomatous inflammation is typically encountered. The granulomas can be necrotizing or non-necrotizing. Using a microscope and appropriate stains, organisms can be seen within the granulomas.

===Cat-scratch disease===
Cat-scratch disease is an infection caused by the bacterial organism &quot;Bartonella henselae&quot;, typically acquired by a scratch from a kitten infected with the organism. The granulomas in this disease are found in the lymph nodes draining the site of the scratch. They are characteristically &quot;suppurative&quot;, i.e., pus-forming, containing large numbers of neutrophils. Organisms are usually difficult to find within the granulomas using methods routinely used in pathology laboratories.

===Rheumatic fever===
Rheumatic fever is a systemic disease affecting the periarteriolar connective tissue and can occur after an untreated group A, beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngeal infection. It is believed to be caused by antibody cross-reactivity.

===Sarcoidosis===

Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown cause characterized by non-necrotizing (&quot;non-caseating&quot;) granulomas in multiple organs and body sites, most commonly the lungs and lymph nodes within the chest cavity. Other common sites of involvement include the liver, spleen, skin, and eyes. The granulomas of sarcoidosis are similar to those of tuberculosis and other infectious granulomatous diseases. In most cases of sarcoidosis, though, the granulomas do not contain necrosis and are surrounded by concentric scar tissue (fibrosis). Sarcoid granulomas often contain star-shaped structures called &quot;asteroid bodies&quot; or lamellar structures termed &quot;Schaumann bodies&quot;, but these structures are not specific for sarcoidosis. Sarcoid granulomas can resolve spontaneously without complications or heal with residual scarring. In the lungs, this scarring can cause a condition known as pulmonary fibrosis that impairs breathing. In the heart, it can lead to rhythm disturbances, heart failure, and even death.

===Crohn&#x27;s disease===
Crohn&#x27;s disease is an inflammatory condition of uncertain cause characterized by severe inflammation in the wall of the intestines and other parts of the abdomen. Within the inflammation in the gut wall, granulomas are often found and are a clue to the diagnosis.

===&quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;===
&quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; infection in infants can cause potentially fatal disseminated granulomas, called granulomatosis infantiseptica, following &quot;in utero&quot; infection.

=== &quot;Leishmania&quot; spp. ===
Leishmaniases are a group of human diseases caused by &quot;Leishmania&quot; genus and transmitted by a sandfly bite can lead to granulomatous inflammation in skin (cutaneous form of the disease) and liver (visceral form), with research suggesting effective granuloma formation to be desirable in the resolution of the disease.

===&quot;Pneumocystis&quot; pneumonia===
&quot;Pneumocystis&quot; infection in the lungs is usually not associated with granulomas, but rare cases are well documented to cause granulomatous inflammation. The diagnosis is established by finding &quot;Pneumocystis&quot; yeasts within the granulomas on lung biopsies.

===Aspiration pneumonia===
Aspiration pneumonia is typically caused by aspiration of bacteria from the oral cavity into the lungs, and does not result in the formation of granulomas. Granulomas may form, though, when food particles or other particulate substances such as pill fragments are aspirated into the lungs. Patients typically aspirate food because they have esophageal, gastric, or neurologic problems. Intake of drugs that depress neurologic function may also lead to aspiration. The resultant granulomas are typically found around the airways (bronchioles), and are often accompanied by foreign body-type, multinucleated giant cells, acute inflammation, or organizing pneumonia. The finding of food particles in lung biopsies is diagnostic.

===Rheumatoid arthritis===
Necrotizing granulomas can develop in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, typically manifesting as bumps in the soft tissues around the joints (so-called rheumatoid nodules) or in the lungs.

===Granuloma annulare===
Granuloma annulare is a skin disease of unknown cause in which granulomas are found in the dermis of the skin, but it is not a true granuloma. Typically, a central zone of necrobiotic generation of collagen is seen, with surrounding inflammation and mucin deposition on pathology.

===Foreign-body granuloma===

A foreign-body granuloma occurs when a foreign body (such as a wood splinter, piece of metal, glass etc.) penetrates the body&#x27;s soft tissue followed by acute inflammation and formation of a granuloma. In some cases the foreign body can be found and removed even years after the precipitating event.

===Childhood granulomatous periorificial dermatitis===
Childhood granulomatous periorificial dermatitis is a rare granulomatous skin disorder of unknown cause. It is temporary and tends to affect children, usually of African descent.

==Granulomas associated with vasculitis==
Certain inflammatory diseases are characterised by a combination of granulomatous inflammation and vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels). Both the granulomas as well as the vasculitis tend to occur in association with necrosis. Classic examples of such diseases include granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

==Etymology==
The term is and &quot;-oma&quot;, a suffix used to indicate tumors or masses. The plural is granulomas or granulomata. The adjective granulomatous means &quot;characterized by granulomas&quot;.

<text>West Texas A&amp;M University (WTAMU or WT) is a public university in Canyon, Texas, United States. It is the northernmost campus of the Texas A&amp;M University System and accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). It was established on September 20, 1910, as West Texas State [[Normal school|Normal College]] as one of the seven state-funded teachers&#x27; colleges in Texas.

==History==
===1910 West Texas State Normal College===
In its first school year, West Texas State Normal College had 152 all-white students and 16 faculty members. Its first president was Robert B. Cousins. A year after the Texas State House of Representatives approved the bill to establish West Texas State Normal College, construction began on the school&#x27;s Administration Building. It consisted of the school&#x27;s only classrooms, laboratory, library, and offices. On March 25, 1914, the school burned down; however, classes continued in local churches, courthouses, and vacant buildings. Later, in 1916, a new Administration Building opened. West Texas State Normal College hired famed American artist Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe to be the head of the Art Department from the fall of 1916 to February 1918. O&#x27;Keeffe has been recognized as the &quot;Mother of American modernism&quot;.

===1923 West Texas State Teachers College===
The first four-year college degrees were granted in 1919. In the following years, the college was admitted to the American Association of Teachers Colleges in 1922, the Association of Texas Colleges in 1923, and the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1925. The school changed its name to West Texas State Teachers College in 1923. In the early 1930s, the Panhandle-Plains Historical Society built its Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum on the campus.

In 1948, a nonconformist leftist sociology professor, Joseph L. Duflot, created a sensation on campus when he told a meeting of the American Federation of Labor in Amarillo that &quot;modern capitalism&quot; is the &quot;No. 1 enemy of the United States economy.&quot; A powerful legislator at the time, Sam Hanna of Dallas County, warned that state funding could be jeopardized for any college with &quot;a communist&quot; on the faculty. Though the West Texas regents first dismissed Duflot, he survived a second vote, and regent H.L. Mills praised him for &quot;the courage of his convictions&quot;. During the days of West Texas State University, the football team was an enormously successful feeder program for notable professional wrestlers including Tully Blanchard, Dusty Rhodes, Terry Funk, Ted DiBiase, Bobby Duncum, Tito Santana, Barry Windham, Bruiser Brody, Dory Funk Jr., and Stan Hansen, among others.

Many returning veterans from World War II enrolled at the institution in the latter 1940s, taking advantage of new G.I. Bill of Rights assistance. Conditions were so overcrowded for a time that the former soldiers slept in the gymnasium, and beds were brought from a former prisoner of war camp in Hereford.

===1949 West Texas State College===
In 1949, the school again changed its name, this time to West Texas State College. During the Cold War, attention at West Texas State was focused on anticommunism. One history professor, John Cook, claimed that many of the films shown on campus, such as &quot;Communism on the Map&quot;, were &quot;propaganda&quot;. During this time, too, historian J. Evetts Haley ran for governor of Texas on a staunchly conservative platform, but the office went to Marion Price Daniel Sr.

===1963 West Texas State University===
At its founding the school admitted only white students. The first black student to graduate was Helen Neal in 1962. During the 1960s, the school changed from a regional teacher&#x27;s college to a state university. In 1963, Governor John B. Connally signed a bill to change the school&#x27;s name to West Texas State University. The newly named school gained a College of Arts and Sciences, a graduate school, and professional schools of business. Near the end of the 1960s, West Texas State obtained its own board of regents, established a School of Agriculture and a School of Fine Arts, and created a Department of Nursing.

By 1970, the student enrollment neared 8,000, but was decreasing. The primary reasons were the changes in the Selective Service System and increases in tuition. The university&#x27;s funding was largely enrollment-driven, and this caused serious financial problems for the school.

The college radio station KWTS began broadcasting in 1972. The West Texas State athletics were in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Missouri Valley Conference, but the school decided to change its status to Division II and the Lone Star Conference in 1984.

In 1986, WT President Ed Roach was the subject of protests and calls for his resignation over the amount of money spent on the campus&#x27; Presidential House. The house cost $991,000, which was more than the $494,900 authorized by the State College Coordinating Board. In 1991, Roach was indicted for diverting scholarship money to meet other budget deficits.

===1993 West Texas A&amp;M University===
The university joined the Texas A&amp;M University System on September 1, 1990, and started to use the name West Texas A&amp;M University in 1993. The letters &quot;A&amp;M&quot; short for &quot;Agricultural and Mechanical&quot; taken from the Morrill Land-Grant Acts. The school&#x27;s first president under the new system was Barry B. Thompson. Early in Thompson&#x27;s tenure, he dropped the school&#x27;s football program, but the program returned a year later without athletic scholarships.

President Thompson was appointed chancellor of the Texas A&amp;M University System in 1994 and Russell C. Long became the new president. During Long&#x27;s tenure, the school renovated buildings, maintained its student enrollment growth, and added its first PhD in agriculture.
The school had a long-term connection with T. Boone Pickens, who was appointed to its board of regents in 1969. On March 21, 1973, Pickens resigned from the board in protest, but was reappointed in 1981 and became its chair in 1982. He continued to chair its board until its merger with the Texas A&amp;M system in 1990. In 1987, he pledged a $1.5 million matching gift to endow its business school, which was named in his honor. On November 24, 2004, the school issued a press release stating that it planned to remove Pickens&#x27; name from the T. Boone Pickens College of Business after university officials came to believe he had not completed pledges he made to the university. In fact, Pickens had satisfied his pledge, but asked to have his name removed. On December 1, 2004, the then-President Russell C. Long acknowledged the error and agreed to remove Pickens&#x27; name. Subsequently, Pickens donated $165 million to Oklahoma State University-Stillwater. In 2007, Pickens endowed the Pickens Professorship of Business and in 2010, he endowed the Pickens Professorship of Management. In 2017, the business school was named the Paul and Virginia Engler College of Business in recognition of the largest gift ($80 million) received by the university in its history.

In late 2005, Long retired from his position as the school&#x27;s president, and J. Patrick O&#x27;Brien took that office in early 2006.
During the tenure of President O&#x27;Brien, WTAMU saw a surge of construction projects completed, including the Sybil B. Harrington Fine Arts Complex, the Hayward Spirit Tower, the Charles K. and Barbara Kerr Vaughan Pedestrian Mall, the Buffalo Sports Park (including Wilder Park and Schaeffer Field), a new entrance/climbing wall and renovations in the Virgil Hensen Activity Center, Buff Hall, Centennial Hall, Founders Hall, two new parking lots, Victory Circle, the JBK Student Center Expansion, Classroom Center/WTBookstore renovation, Engineering and Computer Science Building renovation and the implementation of the WT Amarillo Center in Center City, Amarillo.
In January 2009, the university began its first comprehensive campaign to raise $35 million for scholarships, faculty/program support, and capital projects. The Share your Pride campaign ended in August 2014 and raised more than $50 million.

The university briefly attracted national attention in 2023 when the university&#x27;s president cancelled a student group&#x27;s drag show on campus. Shortly thereafter, the university&#x27;s faculty senate voted &quot;no confidence&quot; in president Wendler, harshly criticizing his leadership beyond just that one decision.

During 2024 the university has banned access to gambling sites through university resources, including any WT-owned cell phones, laptops, tablets, desktops, and Wi-Fi.

<doc id="446257" wikidata="Q1118577" url="?curid=446257" title="Max Sandlin">
<text>Max Allen Sandlin Jr. (born September 29, 1952) is a former Democratic Congressman who served eight years in the U.S. House of Representatives representing Texas&#x27;s 1st congressional district from 1997 to 2005.

==Early life and career==
The son of the former Margie Beth Barnett and her husband Maxwell Allen Sandlin, Max Sandlin is a graduate of Baylor University, where he was a member of Phi Delta Theta and named Outstanding Young Alumni, and Baylor University School of Law, where he was a member of the National Championship Mock Trial Team. He was the Distinguished Speaker for the John William Minton and Florence Dean Minton Endowed Law School Lecture Series at Law Day 2004 at Baylor Law School.

He practiced law in Texas and had a broad-based litigation and business practice. He was active in the banking and energy industries. He also served on the Board of Directors of East Texas Legal Services. He is a former County Judge and County Court at Law Judge.

==Congress ==
First elected to Congress in 1996, he rose to become a member of the senior House Democratic leadership, serving as Chief Deputy Whip. He served on the powerful and exclusive Ways and Means Committee, the Financial Services Committee, and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. He was an elected and later a leadership representative on the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, and also among the small group of legislators selected for the Parliamentary Group, representatives called upon for rapid parliamentary and procedural action on the floor of the U.S. House.

Sandlin was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition and was Chairman of the Blue Dog Energy Task Force. Additionally, he served as Chairman of the Democratic Caucus Financial Services Task Force and was a member of the New Democrat Coalition.

While in the House, Sandlin was frequently asked to present and argue policy, and the Austin American-Statesman noted &quot;Sandlin is a forceful and articulate speaker, a lawyer by trade who treats audiences like juries that can be charmed, coaxed, inspired and won over.&quot;
The Paris Daily News noted that &quot;Sandlin is highly polished...with God-given speaking talents&quot; and an &quot;...ability to communicate eloquently.&quot;

Sandlin was known as a consensus builder, and &quot;The Almanac of American Politics&quot; noted that he had a &quot;...moderate voting record that straddles Democratic wings.&quot;
The Democratic Caucus and leadership often called upon Sandlin&#x27;s coalition-building skills and U.S. Rep. George Miller (D-CA) noted &quot;We&#x27;ve always looked for a way to build that bridge [between liberals and centrists]. He [Sandlin] certainly has that talent.&quot;
The Austin American-Statesman added that &quot;Sandlin&#x27;s a versatile campaigner, equally at home with Unitarians as he is in a roomful of good ol&#x27; boys.&quot;
Sandlin was a primary target of the Republican 2003 re-redistricting process orchestrated by then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX). Sandlin&#x27;s district was made significantly more urban and Republican than its predecessor. Sandlin denounced the reconfiguring of his district, calling it an illegal and unconstitutional effort to dilute and eliminate the voices of rural and minority voters. Sandlin lost to former district judge Louie Gohmert in a massive landslide, taking only 39 percent of the vote. Three other members of the so-called &quot;Texas Five&quot; were also defeated after their districts were radically altered. No Democrat has garnered more than 35 percent of the vote since Sandlin left office.

==Private life==
Sandlin is currently a partner and co-chairman of Mercury, a public strategy firm.

Sandlin is a former youth baseball, basketball, and softball coach. He is the father of five children, has three grandchildren, and is married to former U.S. Representative Stephanie Herseth Sandlin (D-SD).

<doc id="446262" wikidata="Q16954099" url="?curid=446262" title="Murder in Small Town X">
<text>Murder in Small Town X (sometimes abbreviated MiSTX) is an American reality television series created by George Verschoor, Robert Fisher Jr., and Gordon Cassidy and was hosted by Sgt. Gary Fredo, a California Police Investigator, that aired on Fox from July through September 2001. The series immerses contestants in a fictional town, and challenges them to solve a murder. Each week, one of the contestants is &quot;murdered&quot; (and removed from the show); the final contestant solves the case and wins $250,000.

Although classified as a reality television series, given the format&#x27;s unique nature, it was more accurately described as a hybrid of a reality TV show, game show, and mystery drama. It is notable for the fact that its winner, New York City fireman Ángel Juarbe Jr., died in the September 11 attacks exactly one week after the show&#x27;s finale aired.

==Premise==
The premise of the show was to bring 10 contestants from around the United States of America to the small fishing village of Eastport, Maine (called &quot;Sunrise&quot; in the show) to act as amateur investigators to solve a series of fictional murders.

Initially, the investigators were given a list of 15 suspects who were &quot;townspeople&quot; played by actors and actresses. A large number of improvisational actors and actresses were stationed around the real-life town, and their job was to provide clues (useful and not useful) to the investigators. Each week, the investigators were sent out on varying missions around the town in order to discover clues to clear suspects. Additionally, the murderer would strike again, clearing suspects as well.

In every episode a Lead Investigator, or Lifeguard, is chosen. In the first episode, the Lifeguard is chosen by picking one of ten cards. For the following episodes, the Lifeguard is chosen by the investigator who was eliminated the previous episode via pre-recorded message. For the final two investigators, the previous investigator who was eliminated will determine who gets his or her first choice on which suspect they want to pursue.

Every three days, two envelopes, red and black, would be discovered somewhere in the town. In the red envelope, there would be a question about what the investigators had learned during the day. The question would usually be pointed to one of the track teams, meaning whoever was involved with that line of investigation has the highest potential of answering it correctly. The team&#x27;s answer would be sent to the killer via e-mail, with the address being anonymous. If correct, the killer would clear one of the remaining suspects. If wrong, the number of suspects would remain the same.

Afterward, the black envelope would be opened. It contains two smaller black envelopes, each containing a map of a certain location. The investigators (except the Lifeguard) would go into a separate room to vote for the first person who will play the Killer&#x27;s game. After the vote, the Lifeguard picks the second person who will play. The two investigators would each choose a map and head out to the two different remote locations completely alone, with their movements recorded only by night-vision cameras. One of the investigators would discover an important clue to the mystery, whereas the other would be eliminated off the show by being &quot;murdered by the killer&quot;, with their last seconds seen through the eyes of said &quot;killer&quot; in the manner of classical slasher films.

Taco Bell promoted the show.

==Story==
The game started out with the mysterious murder of a family known as the Flints, on which the investigators would base their investigation. It soon turned out there was much more to this case when suspects started to turn up dead. The solution to the mystery involved the discovery that the members of a local family, the Duchamps, had been murdered together in 1941 just after the Pearl Harbor Attack because they had stumbled onto a town&#x27;s secret involving illegal liquor smuggling from Canada. The murder had been committed with the assent of many of the town&#x27;s leaders, who met in a secret lodge, a society called &quot;The Order of the Scarlet Lupine&quot; or the &quot;O.S.L.&quot; The family had been bound in a room together, and the room was set on fire.

The &quot;murders&quot; were being committed by a descendant of one of the family members who escaped the fire and who was gaining his revenge against the descendants of the town leaders who had condoned the burning of the family in 1941. This survivor, known as the &quot;Burnt Face Man&quot;, left several recordings of himself to his child, which were clues for the investigators. As it turned out, he murdered one of the men responsible for the killing of his family, but he was overwhelmed with guilt and committed suicide. The burnt man&#x27;s child decided to take up his father&#x27;s work, attacking those responsible or descendants of those responsible for his family&#x27;s death. Using a bang stick, a close-range rifle-like weapon used to kill fish, not only was he &quot;not&quot; overwhelmed with guilt like his father, he found it exciting, and decided to make a game of it, resulting in the creation of the killers game.

The killer was revealed to be William Lambert (whose real last name is Duchamps), a business partner of Nate Flint and a common target of suspicion (although all initial theories about him turned out to be irrelevant). He killed the people that were either related to or are the members of the O.S.L. They were Blodgett (killed by his father), DeBeck, Flint, Merchant, Rose, Thibodeaux, and the eliminated investigators, using their corpses to recreate the unfinished family dinner they had before being interrupted by the fire. Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Larabee was supposed to be William&#x27;s last victim (completing the set), but in the finale, Ángel, the winner, rescued her before William was able to complete his final murder. The fictional police chief, Dudley Duncan, chased him up a flight of stairs and shot him in his bedroom, sending him crashing out the window and falling two stories to the hard concrete below.

==Contestants==
==Voting history==



&quot;Italic&quot; names represent non-revealed votes, but were based on alliances.
In episode 6, a tie vote occurred between Jeff and Kristen. When asked to break the tie as a lifeguard, Katie opted to send both out to play the Killer&#x27;s Game.

In the finale, Alan and Jeff didn&#x27;t vote against each other. Because Ángel was immune (as he was chosen by Katie to be the lifeguard), there was no reason to vote and Alan and Jeff were immediately handed their maps.
==The game==

===The Killer&#x27;s Questions===
During each episode, the investigators would find a pair of red and black envelopes. While the black envelopes were for the Killer&#x27;s Game, the red envelopes contained a questions for the investigators. The question usually pertained to one specific part of the day&#x27;s investigation, and was only able to be answered correctly by the investigators that took part in the investigation at that point. For example, in Episode 2 the question was &quot;what was the date of Oscar Blodgett&#x27;s birth?&quot; Andy and Angel were guarding his grave plot after it was vandalized and would be the ones who could answer it. When the group decided on an answer, they would email the answer to the killer&#x27;s anonymous email address. The killer would then send them confirmation of a correct or incorrect answer. A correct answer eliminated a suspect, while an incorrect answer did nothing (this however is unknown since all questions were answered correctly.)

===The Suspects===
These are fifteen suspects, in the order they were cleared of being the killer.

Kristen found G.D. at the end of the Killer&#x27;s Game. Because Brian was killed by the killer, G.D. could not be the killer. In addition, G.D. was killed that night, but not found out until the next day.

Samantha was going to be William&#x27;s final victim, but Angel rescued her before he could kill her.

Prudence was cleared because the Burnt Man says, &quot;Goodbye my son...&quot;. This indicated that the killer had to be male.

Jimmy was cleared because he was too young to be the Burnt Man&#x27;s son. He was 21, as the Burnt Man&#x27;s final film is from 30 years ago.

==Episodes==
=== Season 1 ===
==Death of Ángel Juarbe Jr.==
Exactly one week after the airing of the finale, the show&#x27;s winner, Ángel Juarbe Jr, being a seven-year veteran of the FDNY, was one of the first responders in the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks. It was reported that he was caught in the collapse of the first tower, but according to Richard Hoeg, Juarbe was not caught in the collapse of the first tower, rather he was caught in the collapse of the adjoining Marriott Hotel while he and a lieutenant from Ladder 12 (the same company as Juarbe) were attempting a rescue of another firefighter. On November 28, 2001, his body was found and identified in the Marriott hotel rubble next to the World Trade Center towers. The show&#x27;s primary icon, the fisherman statue, now serves as memorial to Juarbe.

==Cancellation==
The series did not achieve strong ratings and was not renewed by Fox. The format was sold to the BBC who made a British version (with slight amendments to the rules) in 2003 entitled &quot;The Murder Game&quot;. Ratings were poor and the program was not a critical success.

<doc id="446263" wikidata="Q331889" url="?curid=446263" title="Viriathus">
<text>Viriathus (also spelled Viriatus; known as Viriato in Portuguese and Spanish; died 139 BC) was the most important leader of the Lusitanian people that resisted Roman expansion into the regions of western Hispania (as the Romans called it) or western Iberia (as the Greeks called it), where the Roman province of Lusitania would be finally established after the conquest.

Viriathus developed alliances with other Celtic groups, even far away from his usual theatres of war, inducing them to rebel against Rome. He led his army, supported by most of the Lusitanian and Vetton tribes as well as by other Celtic and Iberian allies, to several victories over the Romans between 147 BC and 139 BC before being betrayed by them and murdered while sleeping. Theodor Mommsen said of him: &quot;It seemed as if, in that thoroughly prosaic age, one of the Homeric heroes had reappeared.&quot;

== Etymology ==
There are several possible etymologies for the name Viriathus. The name can be composed of two elements: &quot;Viri&quot; and &quot;Athus&quot;.
&quot;Viri&quot; may come from:
*the Indo-European root *uiros, &quot;man&quot;, relating to strength and virility;
*the Celtic *uiro- &#x27;man&#x27;; and the older forms viros, viri, viro, viron from which derived the Old Irish word for man, &quot;fir&quot;;
*from *&quot;uei&quot;-, as in the &quot;viriae&quot; or Celtiberian &quot;twisted armbands&quot; used by warriors (Pliny XXIII, 39);
*the Latin &quot;viri&quot; (pronounced &quot;wee-ree&quot;, coming from the Indo-European root above) meaning man, hero, person of courage, honor, and nobility.

*It is cognate to the Welsh name Gwriad and possibly to the Irish name Ferdiad.

The Celtic elite used the title uiros ueramos, meaning the &#x27;highest man&#x27; and the Latin equivalent would be &quot;summus vir&quot;.

According to the historian Schulten, Viriathus had a Celtic name.

== Viriathus&#x27; life ==

Little is known about Viriathus. The only reference to the location of his native tribe was made by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, who claims he was from the Lusitanian tribes of the ocean side.

He belonged to the class of warriors, the occupation of the minority ruling elites. He was known to the Romans as the &quot;dux&quot; of the Lusitanian army, as the &quot;adsertor&quot; (protector) of Hispania, or as an &quot;imperator&quot;, probably of the confederated Lusitanian and Celtiberian tribes.

Livy described him as a shepherd who became a hunter, then a soldier, thus following the path of most young warriors, the &quot;iuventus&quot;, who devoted themselves to cattle raiding, hunting and war.

According to Appian, Viriathus was one of the few who escaped when Galba, the Roman governor, massacred the &quot;flos iuventutis&quot;, the flower of the young Lusitanian warriors, in 150 BC.

Two years after the massacre, in 148 BC, Viriathus became the leader of a Lusitanian army.

Viriathus was thought by some to have a very obscure origin, although Diodorus Siculus also says that Viriathus &quot;approved himself to be a prince&quot; and that he said he was &quot;lord and owner of all&quot;. His family was unknown to the Romans who were familiar with the native aristocratic warrior society.
His personality and his physical and intellectual abilities as well as his skills as a warrior were described by several authors. He was a man of great physical strength, probably in the very prime of life, an excellent strategist, and possessor of a brilliant mind. Some authors claim that the ancient authors described Viriathus with the precise features of a Celtic king.

He was described as a man who followed the principles of honesty and fair dealing and was acknowledged for being exact and faithful to his word on the treaties and alliances he made. Livy gives him the title of &quot;vir duxque magnus&quot; with the implied qualities that were nothing more than the ideals of the ancient virtues.

A more modern current claims Viriathus belonged to an aristocratic Lusitanian clan who were owners of cattle. For Cassius Dio, he did not pursue power or wealth, but carried on the war for the sake of military glory. His aims could then be compared to pure Roman aristocratic ideals of that time: to serve and gain military glory and honor. Viriathus did not fight for war spoils or material gain, like common soldiers.

The Lusitanians honored Viriathus as their &quot;Benefactor&quot;, (Greek: &quot;euergetes&quot;), and &quot;Savior&quot; (Greek: &quot;soter&quot;), typically Hellenistic honorifics used by kings like the Ptolemies.

Some authors assert that he was probably from the &quot;Herminius Mons&quot; (Serra da Estrela), in the heart of Lusitania, (in central Portugal) or the Beira Alta region.

Most of his life and his war against the Romans are part of legend and Viriathus is considered the earliest Portuguese national hero, given the fact that he was the leader of the confederate tribes of Iberia who resisted Rome. The historian Appianus of Alexandria in his book about Iberia (in the section &quot;Historia Romana&quot;, Roman History), commented that Viriathus &quot;killed numerous Romans and showed great skill&quot;.

=== Viriathus of Silius Italicus ===

It has been argued that Silius Italicus, in his epic poem entitled &quot;Punica&quot;, mentions a former Viriathus who would have been a contemporary of Hannibal. He is referenced as &quot;primo Viriatus in aeuo&quot;, and was a leader of the Gallaeci and of the Lusitanians.

The historical Viriathus would be the one who received the title of &quot;regnator Hiberae magnanimus terrae&quot;, the &quot;magnanimous ruler of the Iberian land&quot;.

== Conquest of Lusitania by Rome ==
In the 3rd century BC, Rome started its conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. The Roman conquest of Iberia began during the Second Punic War, when the senate sent an army to Iberia to block Carthaginian reinforcements from helping Hannibal in the Italian Peninsula. This began Roman involvement in 250 years of subsequent fighting throughout Iberia, resulting in its eventual conquest in 19 BC with the end of the Cantabrian Wars. The Lusitanian War is one of the most well documented episodes of the conquest.

Rome&#x27;s dominion of Iberia met with much opposition. In 197 BC, Rome divided the southeastern coast of Iberia into two provinces, Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior, and two elected &quot;praetors&quot; were assigned to command the legions. As with many other tribes of Iberia, the inhabitants of the Lusitanian castros, or &quot;citanias&quot;, would have been granted peregrina &quot;stipendiaria&quot; but remaining an autonomous (Greek: αὐτονόμων) country through treaties (&quot;foedus&quot;).

Lusitania&#x27;s rich land was praised by ancient authors. Polybius in his &quot;Histories&quot;, &quot;speaking of the natural wealth of Lusitania [...], tells us that owing to the favorable climate both men and animals are very prolific, and the land is constantly productive.&quot;

The Romans charged the native tribes with heavy taxes: a fixed &quot;vectigal&quot; or land-tax, the &quot;tributum&quot; and a certain quantity of cereals. Taxes were not the only source of income; mine exploitation and peace treaties were a source of denarius as well as war spoils and war prisoners who were sold as slaves. The indigenous towns had to deliver their own treasures to the Romans, which left them only with their yearly earnings to pay the taxes. In 174 BC, when Publius Furius Philus was accused of paying very little for the cereals that Iberia was compelled to deliver to Rome, Cato defended the interests of the native tribes. The exploitation and extortion reached such an extreme degree in the provinces that Rome had to create a special tribunal and laws, like the Lex Calpurnia created in 149 BC.

=== Revolts ===
The Lusitanians revolted first in 194 BC against the Romans. Iberia was divided between the tribes that supported Roman rule and the tribes that revolted against Roman rule, as they had been divided before by those who supported the Carthaginian and those who supported Romans.

This period was marked by a number of broken treaties either by the Roman generals, or their senate, that would not ratify the treaties, or by the native people.

In 152 BC the Lusitanians made a peace agreement with Marcus Atilius, after he conquered &quot;Oxthracae&quot;, Lusitania&#x27;s biggest city. In Roman law, peregrini dediticii was the designation given to peoples who had surrendered themselves after taking up arms against the Romans. The terms offered were such that, as soon as Atilius returned to Rome, they rebelled and broke the treaty. Then they attacked the tribes that were Roman subjects and that had sided with the Romans in helping to attack and plunder the Lusitanian towns. Possibly the Lusitanians recovered some of the booty the Romans had divided with those tribes.

In 151 BC the Celtiberians who had become Roman allies, fearing the revenge of the rebels who considered them traitors, asked the Romans to punish the rebellious tribes who had broken out into war and that the legions should remain in Iberia to protect them.

==== Massacre of the Lusitanians ====
The praetor of Hispania Ulterior, Servius Sulpicius Galba commanded the Roman troops in Iberia c.150 BC, and at the same time Lucius Licinius Lucullus was appointed Governor of the Hispania Citerior and commander of an army. In the year 151 BC, Lucullus &quot;being greedy of fame and needing money&quot;, made a peace treaty with the &quot;Caucaei&quot;, of the Vaccaei tribe, after which he ordered his men to kill all the tribe&#x27;s adult males, of which it is said only a few out of 30,000 escaped.

Servius Sulpicius Galba joined forces with Lucius Licinius Lucullus and together started to depopulate Lusitania. While Lucullus invaded the country from the east, Galba attacked it from the south. Unable to sustain a war on two fronts, the Lusitanian troops suffered several losses in engagements with the Romans. Fearing a long siege and the destruction the Roman siege engines would cause in their towns, the Lusitanians sent an embassy to Galba to negotiate a peace treaty, although for the Romans it would be perceived as the &quot;Deditio in dicionem&quot;, the surrender. The Lusitanians hoped they could at least renew the former treaty made with Atilius. Galba received the Lusitanian embassy politely, and a peace treaty was agreed on the terms proposed by him. He commanded them to leave their homes and remain in open country. The Lusitanians probably lost their city and possessions and their land would have become &quot;Ager Publicus&quot;. The conquest of a territory, unless it had been given special conditions, could imply the acquisition, by the Romans, of the conquered territory and all that it contained.
The treaty turned out to be a trap, like the one Lucullus had prepared for the &quot;Caucaei&quot;. When the unarmed Lusitanians, among them Viriathus, were gathered together by Galba to hand over their weapons and to be split into three groups (two of the points of the treaty that had been negotiated) and allocated to new lands, the trap was sprung. With the promise that they would be given new lands they waited unaware while Galba&#x27;s army surrounded them with a ditch, to prevent them from escaping. Afterwards, Roman soldiers were sent in and began to massacre all the males of military age. The survivors are said to have been sold into slavery in Gaul.

The relocation of an entire tribe, accompanied by slaughter or their reduction to the status of slaves was a punishment often inflicted on native populations who took part in revolts.

Galba distributed a little of the plunder to the army and a little to his friends, the native tribes that sided with him, and kept the rest. This incited a massive rebellion, with the entire Lusitanian tribe mustering as they waged war for three years against Rome, but met with many failures.

Three years after the massacre, the rebellion was on the verge of defeat when Viriathus appeared and offered himself as leader. Through his understanding of Roman military methods he saved the rebel Lusitanians by a simple though clever escape plan. Viriathus became the leader of the Lusitanians and caused much grief to the Romans in revenge for the massacre of his people.

== The &quot;War of Fire&quot; ==

The war with Viriathus was called &quot;War of Fire&quot; by the Greek historian Polybius of Megalopolis. Two types of war were carried on by Viriathus, &quot;bellum&quot; (&#x27;war&#x27;), when he used a regular army, and &quot;latrocinium&quot;, when the fighting involved small groups of combatants and the use of guerrilla tactics. For many authors Viriathus is the model of the guerrilla fighter.

Nothing is known about Viriathus until his first feat of war in 149 BC. He was with an army of ten thousand men that invaded southern Turdetania.

Rome sent the praetor Caius Vetilius to fight the rebellion. He attacked a group of Lusitanian warriors who were out foraging, and after several of them were killed, the survivors took refuge in a place that was surrounded by the Roman army. They were about to make a new agreement with the Romans when Viriathus, mistrusting the Romans, proposed an escape plan. The Lusitanians, inflamed by his speech, made him their new commander. His first act was to rescue the trapped and resisting Lusitanians whom he then commanded, first by lining up for battle with the Romans, then scattering the army as they charged. As each wave broke apart and fled in different directions to meet up at a later location, Viriathus with 1,000 chosen men held the army of 10,000 Romans in check by being in a position to attack. Once the rest of the army had fled, he and the thousand men escaped as well. Having effectively saved all of the Lusitanians soldiers, he immediately fortified the loyalty of the people around himself.

Viriathus organized an attack against Caius Vetilius in Tribola. Since the Romans were better armed, he organized guerrilla tactics and sprang imaginative ambushes. Charging with iron spears, tridents and roars, the Lusitanians defeated Vetilius, killing 4,000 out of 10,000 soldiers, including Vetilius himself. In response, Celtiberians were hired to attack the Lusitanians, but were destroyed. After that incident, the Lusitanians clashed with the armies of Gaius Plautius, Claudius Unimanus and Gaius Negidius, all of whom were defeated. During this period Viriathus inspired and convinced the Numantine and some Gauls to rebel against Roman rule.

To complete the subjugation of Lusitania, Rome sent Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus, with 15,000 soldiers and 2,000 cavalry to strengthen Gaius Laelius Sapiens who was a personal friend of Scipio Aemilianus Africanus. Despite accomplishing the retreat of the Lusitanians in an initial victory, Aemilianus returned to Rome without having taken down Viriathus, and the Romans lost most of his reinforcements in Ossuma and Beja in Alentejo. This gave the Lusitanians access to what is today&#x27;s Spanish territory, modern Granada and Murcia. The results of Viriathus&#x27;s efforts as well as those of the Numantine War caused many problems in Rome, the most notable being a drop in legionary recruitment rates.

Learning of these events, Rome sent one of its best generals, Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus, to Iberia. Near Sierra Morena, the Romans fell into a Lusitanian ambush. Viriathus did not harm the Romans and let the soldiers and Servilianus go in exchange for a peace treaty that recognised Lusitanian rule over the land they dominated. This agreement was ratified by the Roman Senate and Viriathus was declared &quot;amicus populi Romani&quot;, (), an ally of the Roman people.

However, the peace brought by the treaty displeased Quintus Servilius Caepio, who got himself appointed successor to his brother, Q. Fabius Maximus Servilianus, in the command of the army and administration of affairs in Iberia. In his reports to the Roman Senate he claimed that the treaty was in the highest degree dishonourable to Rome. Livy seemed to have a different opinion as he writes it was a stain on Servilianus&#x27; military career but comments that the treaty was, &quot;aequis&quot;, fair. The senate authorised Q. Servilius Caepio, on his request, to harass Viriathus as long as it was done secretly. The treaty was in effect for one year. During that time Q. Servilius Caepio harassed Viriathus and kept pressuring with his reports until he was authorised publicly to declare war.

== Death ==

Knowing that the Lusitanian resistance was largely due to Viriathus&#x27; leadership, Caepio bribed Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus, who had been sent by Viriathus as an embassy to establish peace (Appian). These ambassadors returned to their camp and killed Viriathus while he was sleeping. Eutropius claims that when Viriathus&#x27; assassins asked Quintus Servilius Caepio for their payment he answered that &quot;it was never pleasing to the Romans, that a general should be killed by his own soldiers.&quot; Or, in a version more common in modern Portugal and Spain, that &quot;Rome does not pay traitors who kill their chief&quot;. Quintus Servilius Caepio was refused his Triumph by the Senate.

After the death of Viriathus, the Lusitanians kept fighting under the leadership of Tautalus (Greek: Τάυταλος).

Laenas would finally give the Lusitanians the land they originally had asked for before the massacre. Nevertheless, total pacification of Lusitania was only achieved under Augustus. Under Roman rule, Lusitania and its people gradually acquired Roman culture and language.

Viriathus stands as the most successful leader who ever opposed the Roman conquest in Iberia. During the course of his campaigns he was only defeated in battle against the Romans once, and from a military standpoint can be said to have been one of the most successful generals to have ever opposed Rome&#x27;s expansion. Ultimately, even the Romans recognized that it was more prudent to use treachery rather than open confrontation to defeat the Lusitanian uprising. Some fifty years later, the renegade Roman general Quintus Sertorius, at the head of another insurrection in Iberia, would meet a similar fate.

== Legacy ==
Viriathus became an enduring symbol of Portuguese nationality and independence, portrayed by artists and celebrated by its people throughout the centuries. In his epic poem &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot;, Luís Vaz de Camões exalts Viriathus&#x27; great deeds.

The flag of the Spanish province of Zamora, called &quot;la seña bermeja&quot;, has eight red stripes, which traditionally have been associated to the eight victories of Viriathus over the Romans. The historical authenticity of this origin is disputed.

There is a street in Madrid named after him, in Chamberí neighborhood (near the metro station &#x27;Iglesia&#x27;). The same is true of Lisbon, Zamora and many other towns in Spain and Portugal.

The planet HD 45652 b was named Viriato in 2019 after Viriathus.

=== Film and television ===

Luís Miguel Cintra played the part of Viriathus.
* The Spanish television series &quot;Hispania, la leyenda&quot; (2010–2012) is loosely based on his life and exploits. He was played by Roberto Enríquez.
* The History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Barbarians Rising&quot; (2016) features the story of Viriathus in its first episode entitled &quot;Resistance&quot;. Jefferson Hall played Viriathus.

<doc id="446267" wikidata="Q3544229" url="?curid=446267" title="USS Redfish (SS-395)">
<text>USS &quot;Redfish&quot; (SS/AGSS-395), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the redfish. In addition to her naval career, which included sinking the Japanese aircraft carrier &quot;Unryū&quot;, she made several film appearances in the 1950s.

==Construction==
&quot;Redfish&quot;&#x27;s keel was laid down on 9 September 1943 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard of Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 27 January 1944 sponsored by Miss Ruth Roper, and commissioned on 12 April 1944.

==World War II==
&quot;Redfish&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 27 June 1944. Departing 23 July, she sank the 5,953-ton Japanese cargo ship &quot;Batopaha Maru&quot; on 25 August, the 7,311-ton tanker &quot;Ogura Maru Number Two&quot; on 16 September, and the 8,506-ton transport &quot;Mizuho Maru&quot; on 21 September, all off Formosa, before arriving at Midway Island on 2 October. Departing Midway on 25 October and Saipan on 3 November, she sank the 2,345 ton Japanese transport &quot;Hozan Maru&quot; during the night of 22 November – 23 November. Departing Saipan on 1 December, she combined with the night of 8 December – 9 December to heavily damage the Japanese aircraft carrier &quot;Junyō&quot;, putting it out of action for the remainder of the war.
&quot;Redfish&quot; sank the newly built 18,500-ton Japanese aircraft carrier &quot;Unryū&quot;, bound for Mindoro, on 19 December. After diving to 232 feet (71 m), she rose to the surface and raced to escape Japanese pursuit. Arriving at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for repairs on 17 February 1945, she returned to Pearl Harbor 23 July, and remained there until the end of the war.

&quot;Redfish&quot; received a Presidential Unit Citation which read &quot;For extraordinary heroism in action during the First and Second War Patrols against enemy Japanese surface units in the restricted waters of the Pacific. Operating in bold defiance of foul weather and persistent hostile depth charging, gunfire and bombing by outnumbering forces of radar-equipped ships, air escorts and patrol craft, the &quot;Redfish&quot; launched her accurate and intensive gun and torpedo fire during brief periods of concentrated attack to sink a new Japanese aircraft carrier with her entire complement of embarked planes and equipment destined to be used against our forces, to damage severely another vital carrier and to destroy or cripple much additional shipping necessary to the enemy’s continued prosecution of the war. Although forced to the bottom in 230 feet of water by vicious countermeasures, with her pressure hull cracked and numerous leaks throughout, the &quot;Redfish&quot; responded gallantly to the superb handling of her skilled and aggressive ship&#x27;s company and succeeded in evading further damage and returning to port. Her brilliant record of success in combat and her indomitable fighting spirit in the face of the most determined and fierce counterattacks by an alert and relentless enemy reflect the highest credit upon the &quot;Redfish&quot;, her valiant officers and men and the United States Naval Service.&quot;

==Post War service and movie career==

After duty at Guam from September 1945 to January 1946, she arrived at San Diego, California, on 30 January. Departing on 3 March 1947, she voyaged to Guam and Japan before returning 21 June. After operations off the United States West Coast and Hawaii, she sailed toward Korea on 2 February 1951, and operated out of Yokosuka, Japan, until 24 June, in support of United Nations forces. Returning to San Diego on 3 July, she operated off the West Coast.

In the spring of 1954, fitted with a &quot;dummy&quot; rear fin, &quot;Redfish&quot; played the part of Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Nautilus&quot; in the Walt Disney film &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; where the afterdeck of the &quot;Nautilus&quot; was constructed on the deck of the &quot;Redfish&quot; for a scene where the captain puts visitors out on the deck while the boat submerges. In September 1957, with deck and armament modifications, she played the part of the fictional submarine USS &quot;Nerka&quot; in the 1958 motion picture &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot;. She capped her film career by making several appearances in the popular black-and-white television series &quot;The Silent Service&quot;.

Reclassified AGSS-395 on 1 July 1960, she was underway from San Diego, California, on western Pacific deployment from 26 March to 26 September. From then into 1968, she made annual training cruises to the western Pacific. Decommissioned on 27 June 1968 at San Diego, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 30 June, and sunk as a target off San Diego by the submarine &quot;USS Medregal&quot; (AGSS-480) on 6 February 1969.

Although not appearing on screen, the USS Redfish has a minor role in the 2023 movie &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot;, where it pursued Godzilla following its mutation during Operation Crossroads, only to be incapacitated and partially sunk when one of its torpedoes malfunctioned and carried out a circular run. Diagrams of the USS &quot;Tang&quot; (SS-306) are used to represent the damage supposedly dealt in the accident.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Redfish&quot; received two battle stars for World War II service.

<text>A tax treaty, also called double tax agreement (DTA) or double tax avoidance agreement (DTAA), is an agreement between two countries to avoid or mitigate double taxation. Such treaties may cover a range of taxes including income taxes, inheritance taxes, value added taxes, or other taxes. Besides bilateral treaties, multilateral treaties are also in place. For example, European Union (EU) countries are parties to a multilateral agreement with respect to value added taxes under auspices of the EU, while a joint treaty on mutual administrative assistance of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is open to all countries. Tax treaties tend to reduce taxes of one treaty country for residents of the other treaty country to reduce double taxation of the same income.

The provisions and goals vary significantly, with very few tax treaties being alike. Most treaties:
* define which taxes are covered and who is a resident and eligible for benefits,
* reduce the amounts of tax withheld from interest, dividends, and royalties paid by a resident of one country to residents of the other country,
* limit tax of one country on business income of a resident of the other country to that income from a permanent establishment in the first country,
* define circumstances in which income of individuals resident in one country will be taxed in the other country, including salary, self-employment, pension, and other income,
* provide for exemption of certain types of organizations or individuals, and
* provide procedural frameworks for enforcement and dispute resolution.

The stated goals for entering into a treaty often include reduction of double taxation, eliminating tax evasion, and encouraging cross-border trade efficiency. It is generally accepted that tax treaties improve certainty for taxpayers and tax authorities in their international dealings.

Several governments and organizations use model treaties as starting points. Double taxation treaties generally follow the OECD Model Convention and the official commentary and member comments thereon serve as a guidance as to interpretation by each member country. Other relevant models are the UN Model Convention, in the case of treaties with developing countries and the US Model Convention, in the case of treaties negotiated by the United States.

In general, the benefits of tax treaties are available only to tax residents of one of the treaty countries. In most cases, a tax resident of a country is any person that is subject to tax under the domestic laws of that country by reason of domicile, residence, place of incorporation, or similar criteria.

Generally, individuals are considered resident under a tax treaty and subject to taxation where they maintain their primary place of abode. However, residence for treaty purposes extends well beyond the narrow scope of primary place of abode. For example, many countries also treat persons spending more than a fixed number of days in the country as residents. The United States includes citizens and green card holders, wherever living, as subject to taxation, and therefore as residents for tax treaty purposes. Because residence is defined so broadly, most treaties recognize that a person could meet the definition of residence in more than one jurisdiction (i.e., &quot;dual residence&quot;) and provide a “tie breaker” clause. Such clauses typically have a hierarchy of three to five tests for resolving multiple residency, typically including permanent abode as a major factor. Tax residency rarely impacts citizenship or permanent resident status, though certain residency statuses under a country&#x27;s immigration law may influence tax residency. This includes the &#x27;183 day rule&#x27; when the right of abode is invoked.

Entities may be considered resident based on their country of seat of management, their country of organization, or other factors. The criteria are often specified in a treaty, which may enhance or override local law. It is possible under most treaties for an entity to be resident in both countries, particularly where a treaty is between two countries that use different standards for residence under their domestic law. Some treaties provide “tie breaker” rules for entity residency, some do not. Residency is irrelevant in the case of some entities and/or types of income, as members of the entity rather than the entity are subject to tax. The OECD has moved away from place of effective management to a case-by-case resolution using Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) for determining conflicts of dual residency.

==Permanent establishment==

Most treaties provide that business profits (sometimes defined in the treaty) of a resident of one country are subject to tax in the other country only if the profits arise through a permanent establishment in the other country. For eg, in the US and India tax treaty, if the person is resident of both the countries then the further clause added to the argument would be if the person owns a permanent house or has an habitual abode or being a national of a state. Many treaties, however, address certain types of business profits (such as directors&#x27; fees or income from the activities of athletes and entertainers) separately. Such treaties also define what constitutes a permanent establishment (PE). Most but not all tax treaties follow the definition of PE in the OECD Model Treaty. Under the OECD definition, a PE is a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is carried on. Certain locations are specifically enumerated as examples of PEs, including branches, offices, workshops, and others. Specific exceptions from the definition of PE are also provided, such as a site where only preliminary or ancillary activities (such as warehousing of inventory, purchasing of goods, or collection of information) are conducted.

While in general tax treaties do not specify a period of time for which business activities must be conducted through a location before it gives rise to a PE, most OECD member countries do not find a PE in cases in which a place of business exists for less than six months, absent special circumstances. Many treaties explicitly provide a longer threshold, commonly one year or more, for which a construction site must exist before it gives rise to a permanent establishment. In addition, some treaties, most commonly those in which at least one party is a developing country, contain provisions which deem a PE to exist if certain activities (such as services) are conducted for certain periods of time, even where a PE would not otherwise exist.

Even where a resident of one country does not conduct its business activities in another country through a fixed place or business, a PE may still be found to exist in that other country where the business is carried out through a person in that other country that has the authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the resident of the first country. Thus, a resident of one country cannot avoid being treated as having a PE by acting through a dependent agent rather than conducting its business directly. However, carrying on business through an independent agent will generally not result in a PE.

==Withholding taxes==

Many tax systems provide for collection of tax from non-residents by requiring payers of certain types of income to withhold tax from the payment and remit it to the tax authorities. Withholding arrangements may apply to interest, dividends, royalties, and payments for technical assistance. Most tax treaties reduce or eliminate the amount of tax required to be withheld with respect to residents of a treaty country.

==Income from employment==
Most treaties provide mechanisms eliminating taxation of residents of one country by the other country where the amount or duration of performance of services is minimal but also taxing the income in the country performed where it is not minimal. Most treaties also provide special provisions for entertainers and athletes of one country having income in the other country, though such provisions vary highly. Also most treaties provide for limits to taxation of pension or other retirement income.

==Tax exemptions==
Most treaties eliminate from taxation income of certain diplomatic personnel. Most tax treaties also provide that certain entities exempt from tax in one country are also exempt from tax in the other. Entities typically exempt include charities, pension trusts, and government owned entities. Many treaties provide for other exemptions from taxation that one or both countries as considered relevant under their governmental or economic system.

==Harmonization of tax rates==
Tax treaties usually specify the same maximum rate of tax that may be imposed on some types of income. As an example, a treaty may provide that interest earned by a nonresident eligible for benefits under the treaty is taxed at no more than five percent (5%). However, local law in some cases may provide a lower rate of tax irrespective of the treaty. In such cases, the lower local law rate prevails.

==Provisions unique to inheritance taxes==
Generally, income taxes and inheritance taxes are addressed in separate treaties. Inheritance tax treaties often cover estate and gift taxes. Generally fiscal domicile under such treaties is defined by reference to domicile as opposed to tax residence. Such treaties specify what persons and property are subject to tax by each country upon transfer of the property by inheritance or gift. Some treaties specify which party bears the burden of such tax, but often such determination relies on local law (which may differ from country to country).

Most inheritance tax treaties permit each country to tax domiciliaries of the other country on real property situated in the taxing country, property forming a part of a trade or business in the taxing country, tangible movable property situated in the taxing country at the time of transfer (often excluding ships and aircraft operated internationally), and certain other items. Most treaties permit the estate or donor to claim certain deductions, exemptions, or credits in calculating the tax that might not otherwise be allowed to non-domiciliaries.

==Double tax relief==
Nearly all tax treaties provide a specific mechanism for eliminating it, but the risk of double taxation is still potentially present. This mechanism usually requires that each country grant a credit for the taxes of the other country to reduce the taxes of a resident of the country. Seen in the US-India treaty, as per the DTAA, if interest income arises in India and the amount belongs to a US Resident, then the said amount shall be taxable in the US. However, such interest may be liable to tax in India as per the Indian Income Tax Act. The treaty may or may not provide mechanisms for limiting this credit, and may or may not limit the application of local law mechanisms to do the same.

==Mutual enforcement==
Taxpayers may relocate themselves and their assets to avoid paying taxes. Some treaties thus require each treaty country to assist the other in collection of taxes, to counter the revenue rule, and other enforcement of their tax rules. Most tax treaties include, at a minimum, a requirement that the countries exchange of information needed to foster enforcement.

==Tax information exchange agreement==

The purpose of this agreement is to promote international co-operation in tax matters through exchange of information. It was developed by the OECD Global Forum Working Group on Effective Exchange of Information.

The working group consisted of representatives from OECD Member countries as well as delegates from Aruba, Bermuda, Bahrain, Cayman Islands, Cyprus, Isle of Man, Malta, Mauritius, the Netherlands Antilles, the Seychelles and San Marino.

The agreement grew out of the work undertaken by the OECD to address harmful tax practices. The lack of effective exchange of information is one of the key criteria in determining harmful tax practices. The mandate of the working group was to develop a legal instrument that could be used to establish effective exchange of information.

The agreement represents the standard of effective exchange of information for the purposes of the OECD&#x27;s initiative on harmful tax practices. This agreement, which was released in April 2002, is not a binding instrument but contains two models for bilateral agreements. A number of bilateral agreements have been based on this agreement.

==Dispute resolution==
Nearly all tax treaties provide some mechanism under which taxpayers and the countries can resolve disputes arising under the treaty. Generally, the government agency responsible for conducting dispute resolution procedures under the treaty is referred to as the &quot;competent authority&quot; of the country. Competent authorities generally have the power to bind their government in specific cases. The treaty mechanism often calls for the competent authorities to attempt to agree in resolving disputes.

==Limitations on benefits==
Recent treaties of certain countries have contained an article intended to prevent &quot;treaty shopping&quot;, which is the inappropriate use of tax treaties by residents of third states. These limitation on benefits articles deny the benefits of the tax treaty to residents that do not meet additional tests. Limitation on Benefits articles vary widely from treaty to treaty, and are often quite complex. The treaties of some countries, such as the United Kingdom and Italy, focus on subjective purpose for a particular transaction, denying benefits where the transaction was entered into in order to obtain benefits under the treaty. Other countries, such as the United States, focus on the objective characteristics of the party seeking benefits. Generally, individuals and publicly traded companies and their subsidiaries are not adversely impacted by the provisions of a typical limitation of benefits provision in a U.S. tax treaty. With respect to other entities, the provisions tend to deny benefits where an entity seeking benefits is not sufficiently owned by residents of one of the treaty countries (or, in the case of treaties with members of a unified economic bloc such as the European Union or NAFTA, by &quot;equivalent beneficiaries&quot; in the same group of countries). Even where entities are not owned by qualified residents, however, benefits are often available for income earned from the active conduct of a trade or business.

==Priority of law==
Treaties are considered the supreme law of many countries. In those countries, treaty provisions fully override conflicting domestic law provisions. For example, many EU countries could not enforce their group relief schemes under the EU directives. In some countries, treaties are considered of equal weight to domestic law. In those countries, a conflict between domestic law and the treaty must be resolved under the dispute resolution mechanisms of either domestic law or the treaty.

<doc id="446312" wikidata="Q6094217" url="?curid=446312" title="Itch-E and Scratch-E">
<text>Itch-E and Scratch-E are an Australian electronic music group formed in 1991 by Paul Mac (a.k.a. Itch-E, Mace) and Andy Rantzen (a.k.a. Scratch-E, Boo Boo), both playing keyboards and samples. The duo recorded as Boo Boo &amp; Mace! during the late 1990s. At times they have included a third member, Sheriff Lindo (a.k.a. Nutcase), recording under the name Boo-Boo, Mace &#x27;n&#x27; Nutcase. In 2001 they disbanded as Mac pursued his solo career. In 2010 the duo reunited as Itch-E and Scratch-E to release new material.

== History ==
In 1991 Itch-E and Scratch-E were formed in Sydney by Paul Mac (as Itch-E) on keyboards and samples (ex-Smash Mac Mac, The Lab) and Andy Rantzen (as Scratch-E) also on keyboards and samples (ex-Pelican Daughters). Their name refers to United States carton show, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ characters, Itchy and Scratchy, as well as the drug, ecstasy or E. According to Jody Macgregor of AllMusic the name &quot;certainly suggests that the idea of forming a techno duo started as a laugh.&quot; The duo were often joined for live shows by Sheriff &quot;Dub Man&quot; Lindo.

They initially performed a techno sound which drew on early bleep techno as well as influenced by fellow Sydney-based, Severed Heads (Tom Ellard of that group had helped produce an album by Mac&#x27;s earlier band, The Lab, which was never released). The melodic influence of Mac, trained in classical music, gave them a distinctive sound which eventually led to pop success. One of their demos led to the band signing with Volition Records&#x27; label, Second Nature. Their debut mini-album, &quot;Irritable&quot;, was released in August 1992.

The group released the album &quot;Itch-E Kitch-E Koo&quot; in October 1993. It was recorded at two Sydney studios, The Lab and Masking Tapes, with Mac and Rantzen as producers. Kristian Hatton of Haarp Media, in July 2015, listed the album as one of his Top 100 Albums in Niche Electronic Music, and explained &quot;[it] showed that electronic music in our country – although always influenced by America and Europe – could gain attention from a mainstream audience despite being from the underground.&quot;

The lead single from the album, &quot;Sweetness and Light&quot;, was released in May 1994, and was co-written with Justin Brandis (of Pelican Daughters). It became their best-known work, and peaked at #65 on the ARIA Singles Chart. At that time grunge was more popular than rave music: &quot;grunge was introspective and depressive, rave was quite the opposite. It was still gritty, but its core message was utopian: peace, love and unity.&quot; The track was listed in twenty-first place on the Triple J Hottest 100, 1994. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995 they won the inaugural Best Dance Release category. When Mac accepted he declared &quot;We&#x27;d like to thank all of Sydney&#x27;s ecstasy dealers, without whom this award would not be possible.&quot; Although this was bleeped out of the TV broadcast, a sponsor of the awards, the National Drug Offensive, withdrew their funding.

In January 1995 Itch-E and Scratch-E released the album &quot;Itch-E and Scratch-E... and Friends&quot;, which Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described as a &quot;sprawling double album... which covered the gamut of electronic dance.&quot; According to McFarlane the friends appearing on the album included Crackerjack, a &quot;high energy house&quot; duo (with Mac); Event Horizon (comprising Lindo and Rantzen) which provided &quot;funky bleeps&quot;; Alien Headspace&#x27;s &quot;electronic jazz&quot;; and Lindo&#x27;s &quot;hypnotic dub&quot;. They also released a single-only, &quot;Howling Dog&quot;, which was nominated for Best Dance Release at the ARIA Music Awards of 1996. By the end of that year they had to change their name to Boo Boo &amp; Mace! due to international acts of similar names.

As Boo Boo &amp; Mace! the duo issued a studio album, &quot;Sublimely Pointless&quot;, in July 1998 on Prozaac Recordings. More than a year earlier they had released a CD single, &quot;Flowers in the Sky&quot; in February. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1997 it was nominated for Best Dance Release. They also remixed several songs by Australian children&#x27;s group The Wiggles for the soundtrack of &quot;The Wiggles Movie&quot;, as &quot;Wigglemix.&quot; With Lindo aboard, as Boo Boo Mace &#x27;n&#x27; Nutcase they issued a single, &quot;Gotta Move On&quot;, in November 1997. Additional singles by Boo Boo &amp; Mace! followed in 1998. By 2001 the duo had reverted to Itch-E and Scratch-E and released another studio album, &quot;It Is What It Isn&#x27;t&quot; (1 May 2001), but they disbanded in that year with Mac pursuing his solo career.

In January 2010 the duo announced on their MySpace page that they had reformed as Itch-E and Scratch-E. During that year they released another studio album, &quot;Hooray for Everything!!!&quot; (6 August 2010), and four singles, &quot;Other Planets&quot; (March), &quot;r.E.f.r.E.s.h&quot; (May), &quot;Electric&quot; (October) and &quot;Back 2 the Jack&quot; (December). &quot;Hooray for Everything!!!&quot; peaked at No. 23 on the ARIA Dance Albums chart.

In 2015, &quot;Sweetness and Light&quot; was listed at number 1 in In the Mix&#x27;s &#x27;100 Greatest Australian Dance Tracks of All Time&#x27; with Nick Jarvis saying &quot;Paul Mac and Andy Rantzen&#x27;s greatest track symbolises the turning point when the previously underground rave scene suddenly stepped into the mainstream consciousness.&quot;

<doc id="446317" wikidata="Q6942229" url="?curid=446317" title="Music of Niger">
<text>The music of [[Niger]] has developed from the musical traditions of a mix of ethnic groups; Hausa, the Zarma-Songhai, Tuareg, Fula, Kanuri, Toubou, Diffa Arabs and Gurma and the Boudouma from Lac Chad.

Most traditions existed quite independently in French West Africa but have begun to form a mixture of styles since the 1960s. While Niger&#x27;s popular music has had little international attention (in comparison with the music of neighbors Mali or Nigeria), traditional and new musical styles have flourished since the end of the 1980s.

The Hausa, who make up over half of the country&#x27;s population, use the duma for percussion and the molo (a lute) in their Griot traditions, along with the Ganga, alghaïta (shawm) and kakaki (trumpet) for martial, state, and ceremonial occasions. These uses are typified by the ceremonial usage of large trumpets to mark the authority of the Sultanate of Damagaram in the southeast Zinder area &quot;(see Hausa music)&quot;.

Over 20% of Niger&#x27;s population are Zarma people, while the Tuareg and Fulani both number around a million in the early 21st century, somewhat less than 10% each. The Kanuri are just over 4% while the Toubou, Diffa and Gurma are all small populations of less than a half percent each.

The Zarma inhabit the region around the capital, Niamey. They play, generally solo, a variety of lutes (&quot;xalam&quot; or &quot;molo&quot;), flutes and fiddles and, like the Fula, carry on the griot tradition of caste-based praise singers and musicians. Songhai traditional music was the topic of extensive study in the late colonial and early independence period.

The Tuareg of the north are known for romantic, informal sung/spoken love poetry performed by both men and women, with voices accompanied by clapping, tinde drums (in women&#x27;s songs) and a one-stringed viol (in men&#x27;s songs) &quot;(see Tuareg music)&quot;.

The Fula and Wodaabe, a nomadic desert subgroup of Fula, practise group singing accompanied by clapping, stamping and bells. The Wodaabe Gerewol festival is one example of this repeating, hypnotic and percussive choral tradition. The Beriberi too are known for complex polyphony singing.
To get an overall understanding of traditional music and instruments in Niger visit the traditional instrument museum at the CFPM Taya in Niamey. An amazing collection of drums, string instruments and flutes from all tribes in Niger.

==Modern Nigerien music==
Music for the purpose of entertainment has not been readily accepted by the Nigerien government, though restrictions have loosened since the death of Seyni Kountché in 1987. A competitive music festival called the &quot;Prix Dan Gourmou&quot; helped inspire a musical renaissance in the country, led by people like Alassane Dante. The &quot;Centre for Musical Training and Promotion&quot; was founded in 1990, furthering this process, using a grant from the European Development Fund. Musicians formed bands to seek fame both domestically and internationally, with the most successful being the group Takeda, formed by Reggae singer Adams Junior, Saâdou Bori, Fati Mariko, Mamoudou Abdousalam, Sani Aboussa, John Sofakolé, Moussa Poussy and Yacouba Moumouni.

In the mid-1990s, record producer Ibrahima Sylla traveled to Niamey and ended up signing Poussy and Saadou Bori. He has since also helped release records from Adam&#x27;s Junior and from Mamar Kassey, perhaps the best-known Nigerien group outside the country, who combine traditional Songhai styles and modern jazz.

The band Etran Finatawa (&quot;the stars of tradition&quot;), consisting of Tuareg and Wodaabe members, formed in 2004 at the Festival in the Desert. Between 2004 and 2015 Etran Finatawa toured the globe with performances in over 45 countries. 

Since 2008 Tal National has been the most popular modern band in Niger. They are based in Niamey. Their 2008 album A-Na Waya reached the top of the charts in Niger and earned the band numerous awards. In 2013 they signed a worldwide record deal with Fat Cat Records for the album &quot;Kaani&quot;.

Another popular band, Groupe Sogha, created in 2004, has been a popular neo-traditional musical group that combines traditional and modern instruments in its music composed of ten members, five instrumentalists, three singers, and two dancers. The group was Niger&#x27;s music ambassador for the fifth Francophone Games in Niamey. Sogha has two albums to its credit recorded under the artistic direction of the maestro Boncana Maiga.

===&quot;Tuareg Blues&quot;===

&quot;Tuareg Blues&quot; is perhaps the most internationally known of Tuareg musical styles. Growing out of the refugee camps to the 1990s Tuareg insurgencies, Tuareg Blues have been exported to Europe, most notably by the Malian band Tinariwen. Niger born Tuareg Blues artists include Les Filles de Illighadad, the pioneering guitarist Abdallah ag Oumbadougou from Agadez and his band Takrist n&#x27;Akal, Hasso Akotey and Tidawt from Agadez, Group Bombino also from Agadez, Moussa ag Keyna&#x27;s group Toumast, Alhousseini Anivolla from Agadez, Mdou Moctar, and the performer Mouma Bob.

===Rap Nigerien===
&quot;Rap Nigerien&quot;, a mélange of different languages spoken in Niger, appeared at the end of the 1990s. The music is relaxed and mellow, mixed with the sounds of traditional musical styles from the many ethnicities in the country. It grew into an interesting sociologic phenomenon, expanding what was expected of domestic popular entertainment. The young and disaffected have used &quot;Rap Nigerien&quot; to give voice to popular complaints - forced marriages, child labor, corruption, poverty, and other problems.

Rap Nigerien also spontaneously appeared in UNICEF grassroots cultural programs, one of the few outlets for large-scale performance in the country. In August 2004, UNICEF opened the competition &quot;Scene Ouverte Rap&quot;, where 45 new groups were selected from among over 300 entrants. The competition performances took place at the &quot;Centre Culturel Franco – Nigerien&quot; between the 5th and 14 August.

A large number of &quot;Rap Nigerien&quot; acts grew out of this scene and remain active, with the best-known being Awn, Tchakey, Kaidan Gaskya, Wass Wong and Djoro G. Newer groups, such as Haskey Klan, Kamikaz, Rass Idris and Metaphor, have since appeared.

<text>The Prayer Book Rebellion or Western Rising was a popular revolt in Cornwall and Devon in 1549. In that year, the first &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, presenting the theology of the English Reformation, was introduced. The change was widely unpopular, particularly in areas where firm Catholic religious loyalty (even after the Act of Supremacy in 1534) still existed, such as Lancashire. Along with poor economic conditions, the enforcement of English language church services only in Cornish-speaking areas led to an explosion of anger in Cornwall and Devon, initiating an uprising. At the gates of Exeter, the rising leaders announced, &quot;and so we Cornishmen, whereof certain of us understand no English, utterly refuse this new English&quot;. In response, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, sent John Russell to suppress the revolt, with the rebels being defeated and its leaders executed two months after the beginning of hostilities.

==Background==
One probable cause of the Prayer Book Rebellion was the religious changes recently implemented by the government of the new king, Edward VI. In the late 1540s, Lord Protector Somerset, on behalf of the young king, introduced a range of legislative measures as an extension of the English Reformation in England and Wales, with the primary aim of changing theology and practices, particularly in areas of traditionally Catholic religious loyalty – for example, in Cornwall and Devon. When traditional religious processions and pilgrimages were banned, commissioners were sent out to remove all symbols of Catholicism, in line with Thomas Cranmer&#x27;s religious policies favouring Protestantism ever more. In Cornwall, this task was given to William Body, whose perceived desecration of religious shrines led to his murder on 5 April 1548 by William Kylter and Pascoe Trevian at Helston.

This pressure on the lower classes was compounded by the recent poll tax on sheep. This would have affected the region significantly, with the West Country being an area of sheep farming. Rumours circulating that the tax would be extended to other livestock might have increased the discontent. A damaged social structure then meant this local uprising was not sufficiently dealt with by nearby landowners. The Marquess of Exeter, a large landowner in Sampford Courtenay, had recently been attainted. His successor, Lord Russell, was based in London and rarely came out to his land. It is possible this created a lack of local power that would have normally been expected to quell the revolt.

The Cornish had long regarded themselves as a distinct territory of the Kingdom of England, a belief which was reinforced by the Cornish language&#x27;s central role as an expression of ethnic identity; as such, the Reformation, with its emphasis on the usage of English, was seen as a threat to the Cornish national identity. After the Cornish rebellion of 1497 and the subsequent destruction of monasteries from 1536 through to 1545 under King Henry VIII had brought an end to the formal scholarship, supported by the monastic orders, that had sustained the Celtic Cornish and the Catholic Devonian cultural identities. The dissolution of Glasney College and Crantock College as well as Tavistock Abbey in Devon played a significant part in fomenting opposition to future cultural reforms.

It has been argued that the Catholic Church had &quot;proved itself extremely accommodating of Cornish language and culture&quot; and that government attacks on the traditional religion had reawakened the spirit of defiance in Cornwall, and in particular the majority Cornish-speaking far west. Immediate retribution followed with the execution of twenty-eight Cornishmen at Launceston Castle. One execution of a &quot;traitor of Cornwall&quot; occurred on Plymouth Hoe – town accounts gave details of the cost of timber for both gallows and poles. Martin Geoffrey, the pro-Catholic priest of St Keverne, near Helston, was taken to London. After Geoffrey&#x27;s execution, his head was impaled on a staff erected upon London Bridge as was customary.

==Sampford Courtenay and the immediate beginnings of the uprising==
The new prayer book was not uniformly adopted and in 1549, the Act of Uniformity made it unlawful to use the Latin liturgical rites from Whitsunday 1549 onwards. Magistrates were given the task of enforcing the change. Following the enforced change on Whitsunday, on Whitmonday the parishioners of Sampford Courtenay in Devon compelled their priest to revert to the old service. The rebels argued that the new English liturgy was &quot;but lyke a Christmas game.&quot; This claim was probably related to the book&#x27;s provision for men and women to file into the quire on different sides to receive the sacrament, which seemed to remind the Devon men of country dancing. Justices arrived at the next service to enforce the change. An altercation at the service led to a proponent of the change (William Hellyons) killed by being run through with a pitchfork on the steps of the church house.

Following this confrontation, a group of parishioners from Sampford Courtenay decided to march to Exeter to protest at the introduction of the new prayer book. As the group of rebels moved through Devon, they gained large numbers of Catholic supporters and became a significant force. Marching east to Crediton, the Devon rebels laid siege to Exeter, demanding the withdrawal of all English liturgies. Although a number of the inhabitants in Exeter sent a message of support to the rebels, the city refused to open its gates. The gates were to stay closed because of the siege for over a month.

===&quot;Kill all the gentlemen&quot;===

In Cornwall and Devon, the issue of the Book of Common Prayer proved to be the final indignity that the people could peaceably bear. Two decades of unpopular government policies were followed by two years of rampant inflation, in which wheat prices had quadrupled. Along with the rapid enclosure of common lands, the attack on the Church, which was felt to be central to the rural community, led to an explosion of anger. In Cornwall, an army gathered at the town of Bodmin under the leadership of its mayor, Henry Bray, and two staunch Catholic landowners, Sir Humphrey Arundell of Helland and John Winslade of Tregarrick.

Many of the gentry sought protection in old castles. Some shut themselves in St Michael&#x27;s Mount where they were besieged by the rebels who started a bewildering smoke-screen by burning trusses of hay. This, combined with a shortage of food and the distress of women, forced them to surrender. Sir Richard Grenville found refuge in the ruins of Trematon Castle. Deserted by many of his followers, the old man was enticed outside to parley. He was seized and the castle ransacked. Sir Richard and his companions were imprisoned in Launceston gaol. The Cornish army then proceeded to march east across the Tamar border into Devon to join with the Devon rebels near Crediton.

The religious aims of the rebellion were highlighted in the slogan &quot;Kill all the gentlemen and we will have the Six Articles up again, and ceremonies as they were in King Henry&#x27;s time.&quot; However, it also implies a social cause (a view supported by historians such as Guy and Fletcher). That later demands included limiting the size of households belonging to the gentry – theoretically beneficial in a time of population growth and unemployment – possibly suggests an attack on the prestige of the gentry. Certainly such contemporaries as Thomas Cranmer took this view, condemning the rebels for deliberately inciting a class conflict by their demands: &quot;to diminish their strength and to take away their friends, that you might command gentlemen at your pleasures&quot;. Protector Somerset himself saw dislike of the gentry as a common factor in all of the 1549 rebellions: &quot;indeed all hath conceived a wonderful hate against the gentlemen and taketh them all as their enemies.&quot;

The Cornish rebels were also concerned with the use of the English language in the new prayer book. The language-map of Cornwall at this time is quite complicated, but philological studies have suggested that the Cornish language had been in territorial retreat throughout the Middle Ages. Summarising the research, Mark Stoyle says that by 1450, the county was divided into three main linguistic blocs: &quot;West Cornwall was inhabited by a population of Celtic descent, which was mostly Cornish speaking; the western part of East Cornwall was inhabited by a population of Celtic descent, which had largely abandoned the Cornish tongue in favor of English; and the eastern part of East Cornwall was inhabited by a population of Anglo-Saxon descent, which was entirely English speaking.&quot; This tripartite model is however not borne out by modern genetic evidence which shows distinctly Cornish and Devonian genetic identities separate from, but closely related to, both each other and the &#x27;Anglo-Saxon&#x27; English.

The West Cornish, outraged by the introduction of English in their 1549 services, wrote the &quot;Demands of the Western Rebels&quot;, the eighth Article of which states: &quot;...and so we the Cornyshe men (whereof certen of us understande no Englysh) utterly refuse thys newe Englysh&quot;. Responding to this, however, Archbishop Cranmer asked why the Cornishmen should be offended by holding the service in English rather than Cornish when they had before held it in Latin and not understood that.

==Confrontations==

In London, King Edward VI and his privy council became alarmed by this news from the West Country. On instructions from the Lord Protector the Duke of Somerset, one of the Privy Councillors, Sir Gawen Carew, was ordered to &quot;pacify&quot; the rebels. At the same time, Lord John Russell was ordered to take an army to impose a military solution.

The rebels were of many different backgrounds, some farmers, some tin miners, and some fishermen. Cornwall appears to have had a significantly larger militia than other areas of a similar size.

===Crediton confrontation===
After the rebels passed Plymouth, Devonian knights Sir Gawen and Sir Peter Carew were sent to negotiate with the Devon rebels at Crediton. They found their approaches blocked and they were attacked by longbowmen. Shortly before, the Cornish rebels arrived and Arundell had to divide his combined force, sending one force to Clyst St Mary to assist the villagers and the other with the main army to advance upon Exeter, where it besieged the city for 5 weeks.

===Siege of Exeter===

The rebel commanders unsuccessfully tried to persuade John Blackaller, Exeter&#x27;s pro-Catholic mayor, to surrender the town. The city gates were closed as the initial force of some 2,000 men gathered outside.

===Battle of Fenny Bridges===
On 2 July, Lord John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford&#x27;s initial force had reached Honiton. It included 160 Italian arquebusiers and 1,000 landsknechts, German foot soldiers, under the command of Lord William Grey. With promised reinforcements from Wiltshire and Gloucestershire, Russell would have had more than 8,600 men, including a cavalry force of 850 men, all of whom were well armed and well trained. Russell had estimated the combined rebel forces from Cornwall and Devon at only 7,000 men. On 28 July, Arundell decided to block their approach to Exeter at Fenny Bridges. The result of this conflict was inconclusive. Approximately 300 men on each side were reported to have died with Lord Russell and his army returned to Honiton.

===Battle of Woodbury Common===
Lord Russell&#x27;s reinforcements arrived on 2 August and his army of 5,000 men began a march upon Exeter, westward, across the downs. Russell&#x27;s advance continued on to Woodbury Common where they pitched camp. On 4 August, the rebels attacked, but the result was inconclusive with large numbers of prisoners taken by Lord Russell.

===Battle of Clyst St Mary===
Arundell&#x27;s forces re-grouped with the main contingent of 6,000 soldiers at Clyst St Mary, but they were attacked by a central force led by Sir William Francis on 5 August. After a ferocious battle, Russell&#x27;s troops gained the advantage and left a thousand Cornish and Devonians dead and many more taken prisoner.

===Clyst Heath massacre===
Russell pitched camp on Clyst Heath where he had up to 900 bound and gagged rebel prisoners killed, with their throats slit in 10 minutes, according to the chronicler John Hayward.

===Battle of Clyst Heath===
When news of the atrocity reached Arundell&#x27;s forces, a new attack took place early on 6 August. Lord Grey later commented that he had never seen the like nor taken part in such a murderous fray. As he had led the charge against the Scots in the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, this was a telling statement. Some 2,000 soldiers had died at the battle of Clyst Heath. A group of Devon men went north, up the valley of the Exe, where they were overtaken by Sir Gawen Carew who left the corpses of their leaders hanging on gibbets from Dunster to Bath.

===Relief of Exeter===
Lord Russell continued his attack with the relief of Exeter. In London, a proclamation was issued, allowing the lands of those involved in the uprising to be confiscated. Arundell&#x27;s estate was transferred to Sir Gawen Carew, and Sir Peter Carew was rewarded with John Winslade&#x27;s estate in Devon.

===Battle of Sampford Courtenay===

Lord Russell was under the impression that the rebels had been defeated, but news arrived that Arundell&#x27;s army was re-grouping at Sampford Courtenay. This interrupted his plans to send 1,000 men into Cornwall by ship to cut off his enemy&#x27;s retreat. Russell&#x27;s forces were strengthened by the arrival of a force under Provost Marshal Sir Anthony Kingston. His army now numbered more than 8,000, vastly outnumbering what had remained of his opposition. Lord Grey and Sir William Herbert led the attack, and the contemporary Exeter historian John Hooker wrote that &quot;the Cornish would not give in until most of their number had been slain or captured&quot;. Lord John Russell reported that his army had killed between five and six hundred rebels, and his pursuit of the Cornish retreat had killed a further seven hundred.

==Aftermath==
Many involved in the rebellion initially escaped the grasp of government forces, including Arundell, who fled to Launceston. There, he was captured and taken to London together with Winslade, who was caught at Bodmin. In total, over 5,500 people died during the rebellion. Further orders were issued on behalf of the king by the Duke of Somerset and Archbishop Thomas Cranmer to government forces, instructing them to carry out pacification operations the West Country under the leadership of Sir Anthony Kingston. Kingston subsequently ordered the executions of numerous individuals suspected of involvement with the rebellion as part of the post-rebellion reprisals. These included figures such as mayor of Bodmin Nicholas Boyer, portreeve of St Ives John Payne and mayor of Gluvian William Mayow, the latter of which was hanged outside a tavern in St Columb. Several priests were hanged, including Richard Bennett (vicar of St Veep and St Neot) and Simon Morton (vicar of Poundstock and the curate of Pillaton).

In the aftermath of the rebellion, the government came to associate the Cornish language with sedition and &quot;backwardness&quot;. This was one of the reasons why the Book of Common Prayer was never translated into Cornish (unlike Welsh), as proposals to do so were suppressed in the rebellion&#x27;s aftermath. The failure to translate the Book of Common Prayer into Cornish led to the language&#x27;s rapid decline during the 16th and 17th centuries, to the point that by 1700, Cornish had become an endangered language.

In June 2007, Bishop of Truro Bill Ind was awarded the Trelawny Plate, an award given to people seen as making an &quot;outstanding contribution to Cornish life&quot;. During his acceptance of the award, Ind made a speech in which he apologised for the suppression of the rebellion, stating that &quot;I am often asked about my attitude to the Prayerbook Rebellion and in my opinion, there is no doubt that the English Government behaved brutally and stupidly and killed many Cornish people. I don&#x27;t think apologising for something that happened over 500 years ago helps, but I am sorry about what happened and I think it was an enormous mistake.&quot;

<text>Digital Domain (also known as Digital Domain Media Group or DDMG) is an American visual effects, computer animation and digital production company headquartered in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California.

Digital Domain produced visual effects and animation for more than 500 films, including &quot;Dante&#x27;s Peak&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot;, &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, &quot;Armageddon&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; and &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;.

The company is known for creating digital imagery for future films, episodics, advertising and games, and virtual and immersive experiences from its nine locations across North America and Asia in Los Angeles, Vancouver, Montreal, Hyderabad, Luxembourg, Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong.

==History==
The company was founded by film director James Cameron, Stan Winston and Scott Ross in 1993. They began producing visual effects in 1993 with its first three films, &quot;True Lies&quot;, &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, and &quot;Color of Night&quot;, being released in 1994.

=== Early 2000s ===
In October 2002, Digital Domain launched a wholly owned subsidiary, D2 Software, Inc., to market and distribute its Academy Award-winning compositing software, &quot;Nuke&quot;.

In 2002–2003, Digital Domain co-produced its first feature film, &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot;, written and directed by Tim McCanlies and starring Michael Caine, Robert Duvall, Haley Joel Osment, and Kyra Sedgwick.

The founders were known for feuding, principally due to internal conflicts over the film &quot;Titanic&quot;. Founder Scott Ross announced plans to raise $100 million in financing to become more active as a production company. This plan never materialized, forcing management to seek a buyer of the company.

=== 2006–present ===
In May 2006, Digital Domain was purchased by an affiliate of Wyndcrest Holdings, LLC, a private holding company. Wyndcrest&#x27;s principals then included founder John Textor, director Michael Bay, former Microsoft executive Carl Stork and former NFL player and sports television commentator Dan Marino. The buyers purchased the company for an estimated $35 million. Textor and Bay would become co-chairman of Digital Domain and Stork was named CEO.

In 2007, Wyndcrest also acquired The Foundry which was tasked with taking over the development of &quot;Nuke&quot;. The Foundry was subject to a management buy-out in 2009.

In 2011, Digital Domain Media Group entered into the film production business with a major investment into the feature film &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, which was a co-production with OddLot Entertainment and Summit Entertainment. The film was released November 1, 2013.

In November 2011, DDMG took the company public through an initial public offering (IPO), and the company was listed on the NYSE under the symbol DDMG, achieving a market valuation of more than $400 million.

In 2012, subsidiary Digital Domain created a virtual likeness of the late rap star Tupac Shakur for Dr. Dre&#x27;s and Snoop Dogg&#x27;s show at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The performance earned Textor&#x27;s studio the Titanium Award at the 59th annual Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Digital Domain also announced that the company would create virtual Elvis Presley in partnership with CORE Media Group.

In 2015, the UFC hired Digital Domain to create a commercial series for their UFC 189 event.

In 2016, the Pokémon Company hired Digital Domain to create the visual effects for their &quot;Train On&quot; Super Bowl ad, released to celebrate the Pokémon series&#x27; 20th anniversary.

In 2017, Voltron Chronicles, a VR game Digital Domain co-developed with Universal based on Netflix&#x27;s Voltron Legendary Defender, went live. Fans can play this game on PSVR, Oculus Rift and HTC Vive for $15.

In 2018, Digital Domain celebrated its 25th anniversary while announcing the opening of its second Canadian studio in Montreal, Quebec.

In 2019, Digital Domain Head of Software and virtual avatar DigiDoug presented a talk during TED2019 as the first digital human to give a TED Talk in real-time.

In 2020, Digital Domain introduced Masquerade 2.0, the next iteration of its in-house facial capture system, rebuilt from the ground up to bring feature film-quality characters to next-gen games, episodics and commercials. Masquerade 2.0 uses the same tech that was utilized to create Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. The development allows the technology to be applied to smaller projects, bringing the full depth and emotion of an actor’s performance to any screen.

In 2021, Digital Domain utilized its new proprietary face-swapping tool, Charlatan, to create a realistic hologram/digital human combination of Vince Lombardi for Super Bowl LV.

In 2022, Digital Domain announced “Zoey,” the world’s most advanced autonomous virtual human. Powered by machine learning and created using an advanced version of the technology and process that helped bring Thanos to the big screen, the photorealistic Zoey can engage in conversations with multiple participants at once, remember people, access the internet to answer questions and more, paving the way for the next step in the evolution of AI.

===Digital Humans Group===
The company has a sub-division called New Media Group, which is currently led by Hanno Basse, the Chief Technology Officer. This sub-division provides machine learning-based scanning and digitization services to create immersive experiences for any screen. The process involves two programs called Masquerade and Direct Drive, which use high-resolution scans and motion capture technology. The data generated by these programs can be mapped and animated to create compelling visual experiences.

== Financial difficulties ==
In 2009, Digital Domain parent company DDMG launched Tradition Studios in Florida to develop and produce original, family-oriented CGI-animated features. The studio moved on January 3, 2012, to a new facility in Port St. Lucie, built with the city&#x27;s incentives. The studio attracted a number of creators, including Aaron Blaise, the director of &quot;Brother Bear&quot;, and Brad Lewis, co-director of &quot;Cars 2&quot;, who together were developing an animated feature film &quot;The Legend of Tembo&quot; for a planned 2014 release.

In November 2011, DDMG completed a successful IPO capital raise for $40 million. Textor&#x27;s Florida expansion plans did not overcome the continuing negative cash flow of Digital Domain&#x27;s primary visual effects business. In the summer of 2011, Lydian Private Bank failed. As DDMG&#x27;s principal lender and major shareholder, this had a major impact during the peak of DDMG&#x27;s capital consumption. Lydian&#x27;s sizable stake was sold to a hedge fund affiliated with Florida Power &amp; Light which was then traded to hedge fund and lender Tenor Capital. Tenor Capital engaged in heavy short-selling of DDMG&#x27;s publicly listed stock as a strategy to pull cash proceeds from the daily trading of DDMG stock. 

Once considered critical funding for the future of DDMG, the IPO became the vehicle by which hedge funds could prevent the company from accessing capital while profiting from the decline in DDMG&#x27;s stock price. Tenor became a stakeholder in DDMG in early May 2012, with DDMG stock price trading at an all-time high, but DDMG would soon be unable to access the cash needed to fund its Venice operations and its Florida studio growth. Documents and emails demonstrate that Digital Domain senior management believed they had options to put cash into the company. However, Tenor Capital had significant weight as a chief lender and, according to Palm Beach Capital and the Tenor strategy, may have been shorting DDMG stock to profit from its failure.

When a deal to fund the company failed on July 31, Tenor Capital cited a violation of a minimum cash covenant and demanded $51 million on August 20 as repayment for its $35 million loan made four months earlier. The lenders appointed Mike Katzenstein as interim chief operating officer of the company who acted without conferring with DDMG senior management, deciding to close the Florida studio, causing Chairman John Textor to submit a letter of resignation &quot;in profound disagreement&quot; with this decision.

On September 7, 2012, it was announced that all of DDMG&#x27;s Port St. Lucie&#x27;s operations—including Tradition Studios—were to be shut down, laying off nearly 300 newly trained and recruited employees.

=== Bankruptcy, financial restructuring, and lawsuits ===
On September 11, 2012, Digital Domain Media Group Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the company&#x27;s hedge fund lenders alleged the company defaulted on a minimum cash covenant relating to a $35 million loan. DDMG&#x27;s lenders proposed a deal to sell its operating businesses–Digital Domain and Mothership—to a private investment firm, Searchlight Capital Partners, for $15 million. At the public auction on September 21, 2012, Digital Domain&#x27;s visual effects business and its principal animation feature film properties were instead acquired by a joint venture led by a leading DDMG shareholder Beijing Galloping Horse America, LLC in partnership with Reliance MediaWorks (USA) The sale was approved on September 24, 2012.

In July 2013, approximately nine months after Digital Domain filed for bankruptcy, the majority ownership was acquired by Hong Kong listed public company Sun Innovation. This acquisition placed an approximate $3.5 billion valuation on Digital Domain, with Reliance MediaWorks continuing to own the minority stake. Daniel Seah was appointed CEO. Seah spearheaded the bankruptcy acquisition and protection of Digital Domain by DDMG shareholder Beijing Galloping Horse America, LLC.

The bankruptcy and financial restructuring of Digital Domain triggered a number of lawsuits naming John Textor, former Apple CEO John Sculley and the entire Board of Directors, the auditors and others involved in the business and in the IPO offering.

In February 2015, the Supreme Court of New York and the Inspector General of the State of Florida cleared Textor of any financial wrongdoing, and &quot;The Athletic&quot; reported that he had received a settlement from the hedge fund that caused the collapse.

Palm Beach Capital, the largest investor in DDMG, identified hedge funds, Tenor Capital et al., as the primary cause of the company&#x27;s difficulties. Palm Beach Capital cited unlawful finance penalties and possible illegal short selling strategies designed to damage the company&#x27;s public stock price. Ultimately, the hedge fund lenders agreed to settle outstanding claims by the DDMG parties through a May 2016 settlement agreement awarding $8.5 million to former CEO John Textor and $3 million each to the city of Port Saint Lucie and the state of Florida. The settlement also assigned all technology assets of Digital Domain&#x27;s Florida studio.

<text>Robert C. Duncan (Jr.) (born September 2, 1955) is an American astrophysicist now retired from the University of Texas at Austin.

Duncan was born in Pensacola, Florida, in 1955. He grew up in Houston and Boston, where his father played a key role in NASA&#x27;s Apollo Project. Duncan (Jr.) later earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics from Dartmouth College in 1977 and a PhD in physics from Cornell University in 1986. He also studied at the University of Cambridge. As a student, Duncan was a competitive runner and marathoner.

From 1986 to 1988, Duncan worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University. With Christopher Thompson, he proposed and developed the theory of magnetars, and was awarded the Bruno Rossi Prize for this work in 2003. Duncan has written scientific research papers about neutron stars, supernovae, intergalactic gas clouds, neutrino emissions of very dense matter, MHD dynamos and related topics.

== Personal ==
Thanks to &quot;Spy&quot; magazine, Duncan once nearly became the top life-partner of a huge U.S. president.
