<text>Powderfinger were an Australian rock band formed in Brisbane in 1989. From 1992 until their break-up in 2010, the line-up consisted of vocalist Bernard Fanning, guitarists Darren Middleton and Ian Haug, bass guitarist John Collins and drummer Jon Coghill. The group&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Internationalist&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart in September 1998. They followed with four more number-one studio albums in a row: &quot;Odyssey Number Five&quot; (September 2000), &quot;Vulture Street&quot; (July 2003), &quot;Dream Days at the Hotel Existence&quot; (June 2007) and &quot;Golden Rule&quot; (November 2009). Their top-ten hit singles are &quot;My Happiness&quot; (2000), &quot;(Baby I&#x27;ve Got You) On My Mind&quot; (2003) and &quot;Lost and Running&quot; (2007). Powderfinger earned a total of eighteen ARIA Awards, making them the second-most-awarded band, behind Silverchair. Ten Powderfinger albums and DVDs certified multiple-platinum, with &quot;Odyssey Number Five—&quot;their most successful album—achieving eightfold platinum certification for shipment of over 560,000 units.

After the release of their first DVD, &quot;These Days: Live in Concert&quot; (September 2004), and the compilation album &quot;&quot; (November 2004), the group announced a hiatus in 2005. The June 2007 announcement of a two-month-long nationwide tour with Silverchair, Across the Great Divide tour, followed the release of &quot;Dream Days at the Hotel Existence&quot;. Powderfinger were also involved in various philanthropic causes. In 2005, they performed at a WaveAid concert in Sydney, to help raise funds for areas affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Another performance at the Sydney Opera House in October 2007 raised funds for breast cancer victims and their families. One aim of their Across the Great Divide Tour was to promote the efforts of Reconciliation Australia, and awareness of the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. In April 2010, Powderfinger announced that they would be breaking up after their Sunsets Farewell Tour, declaring it would be their last, as they had musically said everything they wanted to say. On 13 November 2010, they played their last concert, signifying their disbandment. In November the following year, rock music journalist Dino Scatena and Powderfinger published a biography, &quot;Footprints: the inside story of Australia&#x27;s best loved band.&quot;

On 23 May 2020, the band reformed for a one-off live-streamed charity performance, &quot;One Night Lonely&quot;.

== History ==
===1989–1993: Formation and early releases===

Powderfinger were formed in 1989 by Steven Bishop (ex–the Eternal) on drums, John Collins (the Eternal) on bass guitar, and Ian Haug (the Vibrants, the Fossils) on guitar and vocals. The Eternal, the Vibrants, and the Fossils were other Brisbane-based outfits. All three members of Powderfinger were students at Brisbane Grammar School—a private school in Spring Hill—and they started as a cover band playing pub rock classics by the Rolling Stones, the Doors, Led Zeppelin, Steppenwolf, Rodriguez, and Neil Young. The band&#x27;s name comes from Young&#x27;s song of the same name. Despite their popularity in Brisbane, when playing a heavy metal gig in Newcastle, New South Wales, in 1990, Powderfinger were booed off stage.

After completing secondary education, Collins and Haug attended the University of Queensland, where the latter met Bernard Fanning in an economics class – and learned that Fanning had similar interests in music and could sing. Fanning took over the role of lead vocals from Haug and also provided guitar and harmonica. Late in 1990, Jon Coghill—another university student with Fanning and Haug—replaced Bishop on drums, which was described as a &quot;mutual leaving&quot;. Bishop later worked in London-based bands based in London, UK, before returning to Brisbane where he was a member of Moonjuice and then the Haymakers. Powderfinger&#x27;s final line-up change was in 1992 with the addition of Darren Middleton (The Pirates) on guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals. Powderfinger initially performed cover versions of other artists&#x27; songs, but gradually developed by writing and performing their own material.

In August 1992, the group self-funded a seven-track self-titled extended play, also known as the &quot;Blue EP&quot;, on their own Finger label, and the album was distributed by MDS. It was produced by Leroy Bath and Ian Taylor, and recorded at Broken Toys Studios, Brisbane. The EP has an early version of &quot;Save Your Skin&quot;, co-written by Coghill, Collins, Haug, Middleton, and Fanning; it was later expanded and released in July 1994 as a single from their debut album, &quot;Parables for Wooden Ears&quot;. Their second EP, &quot;Transfusion&quot;, was issued in September 1993 and distributed by Polydor Records. At that time, Simon McKenzie of &quot;Time Off&quot; noted they were &quot;hoping the major label will put a bit of weight behind the disc, but it&#x27;s not as though they&#x27;ve signed a record deal or anything&quot;. McKenzie felt the EP showed they were &quot;wanting to get heavier and louder for a long time, but is it also a reaction against the sixties tags they&#x27;ve been stuck with?&quot;. The five tracks include &quot;Reap What You Sow&quot;, which reached the No. 1 spot on the ARIA Alternative Singles Chart, replacing Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;. The group recorded their first music video, for &quot;Reap What You Sow&quot;; it was directed by David Barker, who subsequently directed their next seven videos. After the EP&#x27;s success, the group were signed by Polydor.

===1994–1998: Early albums ===

In January 1994, Powderfinger performed on the Big Day Out Tour (see 1994 line-up). On 18 July that year, they released their debut studio album, &quot;Parables for Wooden Ears&quot;, under Polydor. According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane, it &quot;featured complex, meticulously crafted rock but was somewhat ponderous and sombre, which did little to fulfil the promise displayed on &quot;Transfusion&quot;&quot;. The album was produced by Tony Cohen (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, The Cruel Sea), and Fanning later described it as the band&#x27;s &quot;dark dark days&quot;. It received limited radio coverage. Supporting the album&#x27;s release, the band toured heavily, appearing at the Livid and Homebake music festivals. Powderfinger supported United States visitors Pantera on that group&#x27;s Driven Downunder Tour &#x27;94. Another Australian support act on the tour was Newcastle-formed band Silverchair. Three singles were released from Powderfinger&#x27;s debut album—&quot;Tail&quot;, &quot;Grave Concern&quot;, and &quot;Save Your Skin&quot;—but none appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart Top 50. Following the album&#x27;s release and lukewarm reception, in April 1995, the band recorded at Melbourne&#x27;s Metropolis Studio with Lachlan &quot;Magoo&quot; Goold (Regurgitator) and in July released a five-track EP, &quot;Mr Kneebone&quot;.

The band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Double Allergic&quot;, was issued on 2 September 1996; it peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified triple platinum by ARIA for shipment of 210,000 units by 2007. It was co-produced by Tim Whitten and the group. McFarlane felt this album was &quot;more self-assured and textured [it] consolidated the band&#x27;s position at the forefront of the alternative rock scene, alongside the likes of You Am I, Spiderbait, Silverchair, Regurgitator and Tumbleweed. [The album] was full of accessible, spirited rock&quot;. Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll noted &quot;[it] revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves. Powderfinger&#x27;s reason to be is to create songs strong enough for the band and audience to play and hear months or years down the line&quot;. Four singles were released from the album—&quot;Pick You Up&quot;, &quot;D.A.F.&quot;, &quot;Living Type&quot;, and &quot;Take Me In&quot;. &quot;Take Me In&quot; was released as a video single featuring several other music videos by the group. FasterLouder, a music review web site, recalled that &quot;when &quot;Double Allergic&quot; was released in 1996, it showed the band were here for the long haul to become arguably one of the best of the decade&quot;. In 1997 the album was issued in Canada and the group toured North America to promote it.

===1998–2003: Critical acclaim and chart success===

On 7 September 1998, Powderfinger released their third studio album, &quot;Internationalist&quot;, which peaked at No. 1 and spent 101 weeks in the Top 50 of the ARIA Albums Chart; it was produced by Nick DiDia (Rage Against the Machine, Pearl Jam). AllMusic&#x27;s Jonathan Lewis had mixed feelings about the album. He was enchanted by its lead single, &quot;The Day You Come&quot;; however, he believed &quot;the rest of the album didn&#x27;t measure up&quot; except for &quot;some fine tracks&quot; in &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Be Left Out&quot; and &quot;Already Gone&quot;. Nevertheless, by 2007 the album had shipped over 350,000 copies and was certified five times platinum domestically, and it had reached European audiences. &quot;Internationalist&quot; was the first Powderfinger album to win any ARIA Music Awards. At the 1999 ceremony it won &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, &quot;Best Rock Album&quot;, and &quot;Best Cover Art&quot; (by Kevin Wilkins), and &quot;The Day You Come&quot; won &quot;Single of the Year&quot;. &quot;Passenger&quot;, another single from &quot;Internationalist&quot;, was nominated for three additional categories in the following year. The band was both praised and criticised for their political views on &quot;Internationalist&quot;. In a November 1998 interview with Benedict Watts of &quot;Juice Magazine&quot;, Haug said that political messages in &quot;The Day You Come&quot; were not something they were just preaching about, but rather were something they saw as a responsibility.

Powderfinger&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Odyssey Number Five&quot;, was released on 4 September 2000, and also peaked at No. 1. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Marc Weingarten provided a positive review and found the group &quot;prove that there&#x27;s still terrain left to be explored [in] guitar rock ... melancholy is the default mode ... [they] can be as prim as Travis or as mock-grandiose as Oasis&quot;. However, Allmusic&#x27;s Dean Carlson was more negative, seeing the album as &quot;little more than a slightly off-base perspective into the world of mid-90s American grunge&quot;. &quot;Odyssey Number Five&quot; is Powderfinger&#x27;s most commercially successful album, shipping 560,000 copies and certified eight times platinum by 2004. It also appeared on the New Zealand Albums Chart at No. 15. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001, the group won &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, &quot;Highest Selling Album&quot;, &quot;Best Rock Album&quot;, &quot;Best Cover Art&quot; (by Wilkins), and &quot;Best Group&quot;.

Two of &quot;Odyssey Number Five&quot;″s tracks featured on film soundtracks: &quot;These Days&quot;, written for &quot;Two Hands&quot; (1999), and &quot;My Kind of Scene&quot; in &quot;&quot; (2000). Singles from the album are &quot;My Kind of Scene&quot;, &quot;My Happiness&quot;, &quot;Like a Dog&quot;, and the double A-side &quot;The Metre&quot; / &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot;. &quot;My Happiness&quot;, which peaked at No. 4 in Australia and No. 7 in New Zealand, is the group&#x27;s highest-charting single in both countries. At the ARIA Awards ceremony, &quot;My Happiness&quot; won &quot;Single of the Year&quot;, and other songs were nominated in various categories. Their tracks received votes from national radio station Triple J&#x27;s listeners on annual Hottest 100 lists: &quot;These Days&quot;, &quot;Already Gone&quot;, &quot;Good-Day Ray&quot;, and &quot;Passenger&quot; were ranked in 1999, and &quot;My Happiness&quot; and &quot;My Kind of Scene&quot; in 2000. In 2009, &quot;These Days&quot; was voted at No. 21 and &quot;My Happiness&quot; at No. 27 in the Hottest 100 of all time, placing them as second- and fourth-highest Australian tracks after the Hilltop Hoods&#x27; &quot;The Nosebleed Section&quot; and Hunters &amp; Collectors&#x27; &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot;, respectively.

===2003–2005: Rock resurgence===

Powderfinger&#x27;s &quot;Vulture Street&quot; was released on 4 July 2003, and became their third album to peak at No. 1 in Australia, while in New Zealand it reached No. 17. Recorded in January and February 2003, it was named for the location of the band&#x27;s first recording room in West End, Brisbane. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;″s music critic Bernard Zuel approved of &quot;a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album&quot; with &quot;a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, but bears the mark of a superior intellect&quot;; he felt it had Haug and Middleton &quot;dominating in a way they had not since their 1994 debut&quot; album. Simon Evans of musicOMH described the group as having &quot;opted for a visceral live feel, adding a real punch to songs&quot;. Middleton explained that the band&#x27;s aim was to &quot;get a sound in the songs that was reminiscent of things we grew up loving, which was Bowie, Zeppelin, Kiss ... that sort of thing; all based in the 70s. We wanted to sonically have that as well, so it&#x27;s a very old-school-sounding record. It&#x27;s all the old amps, we used old guitars and recorded to tape, of course. It&#x27;s fairly organic in that sense&quot;. &quot;Vulture Street&quot; won four ARIA Awards in 2003: &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, &quot;Best Group&quot;, &quot;Best Rock Album&quot;, and &quot;Best Cover Art&quot; (by Steven Gorrow, Revolution Design). Singles issued from the album are: &quot;(Baby I&#x27;ve Got You) On My Mind&quot;, &quot;Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot;, &quot;Love Your Way&quot;, and &quot;Sunsets&quot;. Tracks were also nominated for awards in 2003 and 2004.

In September 2004 the group issued their first live album, &quot;These Days: Live in Concert&quot;, initially as a CD, and followed in October with a two-disc DVD. One single, &quot;Stumblin&#x27;&quot;, which had appeared on &quot;Vulture Street&quot;, was issued as a live version. In late October they released a compilation album, &quot;&quot;, which included many of their singles from the first four albums as well as non-singles &quot;Thrilloilogy&quot; and &quot;Belter&quot;, and a re-release of &quot;These Days&quot;. &quot;These Days&quot;, although never officially released as a single, was ranked at No. 1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll of 1999. The album also included two new songs: &quot;Bless My Soul&quot; and &quot;Process This&quot;, although only &quot;Bless My Soul&quot; was released as a single. Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Powderfinger appeared at the WaveAid fundraising concert in January 2005 in Sydney, to raise funds for aid organisations working in the disaster-affected areas. Fanning, as a member of The Wrights, sang lead vocals on &quot;Evie, part 2&quot; at the concert. The Wrights released a studio version in March as a single with some of the proceeds going to tsunami relief efforts.

===2005–2006: Side projects===

After the WaveAid concert, from early 2005, Powderfinger had a period of hiatus. During the separation, most band members pursued other musical projects; on the personal front, Haug and Middleton each had children, and Fanning met his future wife. Middleton&#x27;s side project, Drag, had issued an EP, &quot;Gas Food Lodging&quot;, in 2002. Zombos Reviews found the EP was &quot;full of well-written jangly pop, and has some rather nice ballads&quot;. Their debut album, &quot;The Way Out&quot;, recorded in March 2005 and released on 10 July, was &quot;a tad disappointing [compared with the EP] ... mostly mid-tempo pop-rock songs, mixed with some slower, pretty ballads. Everything&#x27;s tastefully arranged, and there&#x27;s always nice melodies and harmonies&quot;. Collins and Haug formed The Predators with Powderfinger&#x27;s former drummer, Steven Bishop, now on drums and lead vocals. The group released a six-track EP, &quot;Pick Up the Pace&quot;, in July 2006 and undertook a short tour around Australia.

In October 2005 Fanning issued his debut solo album, &quot;Tea &amp; Sympathy&quot;, which reached No. 1 in Australia and No. 11 in New Zealand. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2006, Fanning won in four categories including &quot;Album of the Year&quot; for &quot;Tea &amp; Sympathy&quot; and &quot;Best Video&quot; for its lead single, &quot;Wish You Well&quot;. &quot;Wish You Well&quot; was ranked at No. 1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll in 2005. At the end of 2006, Fanning toured in support of the album&#x27;s release in the United Kingdom and North America; at its conclusion, Powderfinger resumed from their hiatus. Fanning compared his solo work to Powderfinger recordings, saying, &quot;when a problem came up in the studio, especially guitar-wise, I&#x27;ve always had Darren and Ian to call on. They could usually come up with something good. But I played all the guitar on it, and my abilities are fairly limited&quot; and that &quot;Powderfinger is my real job and I&#x27;m looking forward to doing it again&quot;.

===2007–2008: Return from hiatus===

Powderfinger started recording their sixth studio album, &quot;Dream Days at the Hotel Existence&quot;, in January 2007; it was released on 2 June. Debuting at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart—their fourth to do so consecutively—it broke the Australian digital sales record with over 3,000 copies sold online. In general, reviewers did not rate it as highly as its predecessor &quot;Vulture Street&quot;, with Cameron Adams of the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; HiT describing it as &quot;No radical reinvention, no huge change in direction ... In a word: consistent&quot;. Zuel described it as &quot;Powderfinger&#x27;s first dull album&quot; but the band as &quot;the biggest rock band in the country.&quot; &quot;Lost and Running&quot;, their first single for three years, had been issued in May, and reached No. 5. A second single, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Remember&quot;, appeared in August. One song from the album, &quot;Black Tears&quot;, was amended following concerns that it could prejudice a trial over the 2004 Palm Island death in custody case. Fanning stated that an alternative version would be on the album as a result of the concerns. On 18 August that year, Powderfinger performed a concert in Karratha as part of Triple J&#x27;s AWOL Series. The band was supported by The Grates and Muph N Plutonic, and various local acts. While in Karratha, Fanning and Coghill visited Gumala Mirnuwarni, a local school in Roebourne that encourages children to stay in school.

In June 2007 Powderfinger and Silverchair announced the nine-week Across the Great Divide tour to promote reconciliation with Indigenous Australians. From August to October that year the two groups toured all state capital cities as well as fourteen Australian regional centres, and included four performances in New Zealand. They performed 34 concerts in 26 towns across Australia, with an estimated total of 220,000 people in attendance. On 1 December, a triple-DVD set was released with the same title as the tour, with the Melbourne performances for both bands and backstage footage from the tour. The schedule consisted of three main parts, beginning with a supporting artist performing one set, followed by Silverchair and then Powderfinger playing the final set. The two bands united on stage during only three performances throughout the tour, including Daniel Johns (Silverchair) and Fanning sharing lead vocals on a cover version of The Who&#x27;s &quot;Substitute&quot; at one show in Sydney and two in Melbourne.

&quot;Dream Days at the Hotel Existence&quot; was the recipient of the ARIA Award for &quot;Best Cover Art&quot; in 2007. It was also nominated for &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, &quot;Best Rock Album&quot;, and &quot;Best Group&quot;, while &quot;Lost and Running&quot; received nominations for &quot;Single of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Video&quot;. Powderfinger failed to win any of these awards, with tour mates Silverchair&#x27;s &quot;Young Modern&quot; and &quot;Straight Lines&quot; obtaining all five. On 28 October at the ceremony, Powderfinger performed &quot;Lost and Running&quot;. The third single from &quot;Dream Days at the Hotel Existence&quot;, &quot;Nobody Sees&quot;, was released in December 2007. On 27 September 2008, Powderfinger performed &quot;(Baby I&#x27;ve Got You) On My Mind&quot; and AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Long Way to the Top&quot; at the AFL Grand Final. Their song &quot;Drifting Further Away&quot; featured on &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;″s fifth season in episode 13, &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, which aired on 21 January 2009.

===2009–2010: &quot;Golden Rule&quot; and disbandment===

From mid-June 2009 Powderfinger worked with DiDia producing their seventh studio album, &quot;Golden Rule&quot;, which was issued on 13 November. The album peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA albums chart, becoming their fifth studio album in a row to do so. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;All of the Dreamers&quot;, was released in September. &quot;Burn Your Name&quot;, the second single, followed in December. That same month the band performed at the 2009 Homebake festival after a 10-year absence. In late January they toured on the 2010 Big Day Out. The third single from the album, &quot;Sail the Widest Stretch&quot;, appeared in April.

Also in April 2010, Powderfinger announced that after 21 years the group would disband following their Sunsets Farewell Tour in September and October that year:


Coghill told &quot;Australian Times&quot; that the final tour is &quot;going to be great fun, but it&#x27;s also going to be sad&quot;. He confirmed that he had no plans to start a new band or for a solo project. Instead he intended to finish his degree, &quot;[o]nce I&#x27;m done with that, I might put the feelers out and see what&#x27;s happening. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be doing anything solo, but I might look to join other bands, just to have a chance to keep playing. I&#x27;m just not keen to be off touring the world anymore&quot;. Powderfinger played their final show at the River Stage in Brisbane on 13 November 2010 in front of 10,000 fans; the last song they performed was &quot;These Days&quot;. On 25 January 2011 the band issued a previously unreleased track, &quot;I&#x27;m on Your Side&quot;, as a fundraiser for the Premier&#x27;s Flood Appeal as a result of major flooding in Queensland from December the previous year into January. The song was available via the band&#x27;s website with all proceeds going towards the cause. On 8 November 2011, the group released a second compilation album, &quot;&quot;, containing two new tracks. There was also a 2-disc release, &quot;Fingerprints &amp; Footprints – The Ultimate Collection&quot;, combining both &quot;Fingerprints&quot; and &quot;Footprints&quot; in one set. Also in November, Dino Scatena, together with the band, published a biography, &quot;Footprints: the inside story of Australia&#x27;s best loved band&quot;. Scatena, a rock music journalist, had started writing the book in October of the previous year, during the Sunsets Farewell Tour.

===2010–present: Afterwards===
Former Powderfinger member Bernard Fanning worked on his second solo album &quot;Departures&quot; during late 2012 in Los Angeles, with Joe Chiccarelli producing. It was released in June the following year and peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Middleton had relocated to Melbourne and worked with Red Door Sounds&#x27; Paul Annison, producer of Children Collide&#x27;s album &quot;Monument&quot; (April 2012). In December that year Middleton revealed that &quot;I’m halfway through a new record&quot;. Middleton&#x27;s album, &quot;Translations&quot;, was released independently in November 2013. Around the same time Coghill was working as a journalist on the Gold Coast, while Collins was &quot;developing business projects in Queensland&quot;.

In January 2013 Haug produced the second album, &quot;Sins of a Li&#x27;l Later Kiss&quot;, by Brisbane-based folk duo Cole and Van Dijk. He then joined the Church, replacing Marty Willson-Piper, and featured on their 2014 album &quot;Further/Deeper&quot;.

On 23 May 2020, Powderfinger reformed for a one-off live-streamed YouTube charity performance titled &quot;One Night Lonely&quot;, with all proceeds going to Beyond Blue and Support Act. On 25 May, an EP of the performance was released.

On 31 August 2020, Powderfinger confirmed the release of a compilation album of unreleased songs titled &quot;Unreleased (1998–2010)&quot;, released on 27 November 2020. It was preceded by the single &quot;Day by Day&quot;, released on 18 September.

On 13 November 2020, Powderfinger released &quot;Daybreak&quot;, the second single preceding the release of the album.

== Musical style ==
Powderfinger&#x27;s musical style includes hard rock and alternative music and, according to McFarlane, &quot;the band made its mark with an earthy, blues-based sound that combined soaring, 1970s-influenced riff-rock with 1990s studio technology. With the added textures of folk, country and a soulful groove, the band was able to head in any direction&quot;. Nimmervoll acclaimed them as &quot;one of Australia&#x27;s most popular radio-friendly rock bands&quot; which &quot;produced music the rest of Australia embraced&quot;. McFarlane was partially disappointed with their debut 1994 album &quot;Parables for Wooden Ears&quot; compared to their earlier EP &quot;Transfusion&quot;. Their 1996 album, &quot;Double Allergic&quot;, was &quot;more self-assured and textured&quot; and &quot;consolidated the band&#x27;s position at the forefront of the alternative rock scene&quot;. It &quot;revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves&quot; according to Nimmervoll.

In a November 2007 interview with Paul Cashmere of the website Undercover, Middleton stated that a couple of songs they had initially written for &quot;Vulture Street&quot; &quot;were just too &quot;Odyssey Number Five&quot; based&quot;, and that the first track, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Rocks&quot;, was &quot;probably the start of where we were heading with the album&quot;. Cashmere stated that the album was &quot;the toughest [he has] heard Powderfinger sound&quot;. Zuel reviewed two of Powderfinger&#x27;s more recent albums, and described &quot;Vulture Street&quot; as &quot;a rawer, louder&quot; album in comparison to &quot;Odyssey Number Five&quot;; it highlighted Fanning&#x27;s &quot;talent as a lyricist&quot; and he stated that it featured guitarists Haug and Middleton &quot;dominating in a way they haven&#x27;t since their 1994 debut&quot;. Zuel also stated that there is a &quot;real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger,&quot; and described &quot;On My Mind&quot; as having &quot;AC/DC meatiness&quot;, and &quot;Love Your Way&quot; as &quot;acoustic tumbling into weaving Zeppelin lines&quot;. In his review of &quot;Dream Days at the Hotel Existence&quot;, Zuel described it as &quot;[having] high-gloss and muscular framework,&quot; and stated that that was what &quot;American radio considers serious rock.&quot;

Clayton Bolger of AllMusic stated in his review of &quot;Dream Days at the Hotel Existence&quot; that Powderfinger &quot;largely revisit the sound of their &quot;Internationalist&quot; album, leaving behind much of the glam and swagger of 2003&#x27;s &quot;Vulture Street&quot;&quot;. He commented on Fanning&#x27;s &quot;commanding and distinctive vocals&quot;, the &quot;twin-guitar attack&quot; of Middleton and Haug, Collins&#x27; &quot;innovative basslines&quot;, and the &quot;powerhouse drum work&quot; of Coghill. Nimmervoll described &quot;Golden Rule&quot; as &quot;Powderfinger back to its essence. They’d experimented with the sound, tried different things with the songwriting process and recorded in America with different producers. [It] was recorded at home, the band reunited with American Nick DiDia, who had previously worked with the band during the &quot;classic&quot; era, producing &quot;Internationalist&quot;, &quot;Odyssey Number 5&quot; and &quot;Vulture Street&quot;. They also wrote the songs as a team, with Bernard responsible for the bulk of the lyrics. The album was recorded in the same spirit, as close to the live sound as a studio album could be&quot;.

== Philanthropy ==

Powderfinger were active in supporting causes or opposing actions taken in charitable, philanthropic, disaster, and political circumstances. In 1996, when Crowded House decided to break up, they organised a farewell concert as a charity event for the Sydney Children&#x27;s Hospital on 24 November. They approached Powderfinger and fellow Australian acts Custard and You Am I to also appear on the steps of the Sydney Opera House. The charity event, which was recorded and later released as a live album titled &quot;Farewell to the World&quot;, was claimed to have the largest Australian live concert audience, with estimates of between 100,000 and 250,000 people. In the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Powderfinger performed at the WaveAid fundraising concert in Sydney in January 2005. The disaster killed more than 225,000 people from 11 countries in the area. The total profit from the funds raised from ticket sales and donations was A$2,300,000, however most of this money was spent in the administrative stream with little reaching those affected.

The song &quot;Black Tears&quot; from the album &quot;Dream Days at the Hotel Existence&quot; originally had the lyric &quot;An island watchhouse bed, a black man&#x27;s lying dead&quot;, which sparked fears that it might prejudice the trial of the former Senior Sergeant Chris Hurley over the 2004 Palm Island death in custody case. The band claimed that the song&#x27;s lyrics primarily dealt with the climbing of Uluru by tourists despite requests from the Indigenous people of the area to respect their sacred sites and not climb. The original version of the song was retracted from the album, and replaced with an alternative version with the criticised material removed. The legal team for Hurley, who was charged with manslaughter over the death of Mulrunji in 2004, had referred the song to the Attorney-General of Queensland, Kerry Shine, in their attempt at altering the track. One of Hurley&#x27;s lawyers, Glen Cranny, stated that &quot;the content and proposed timing of the song&#x27;s release raises some serious concerns regarding Mr Hurley&#x27;s trial&quot;. Powderfinger&#x27;s band manager, Paul Piticco, stated that Fanning had confirmed that a line in the song was related to the case. However, he added that the lyric in question could refer to &quot;a watchhouse in The Bahamas or something&quot;.

In June 2007, Powderfinger and Silverchair announced their combined Across the Great Divide Tour, which promoted Reconciliation Australia, a foundation helping to improve the welfare of the Indigenous people of Australia, and to &quot;show [that] both bands are behind the idea of reconciliation&quot;. Reconciliation Australia increased the awareness of the 17-year difference in life expectancy between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous children of Australia. In October that year, during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Powderfinger performed another concert on the steps of the Sydney Opera House. This concert was for invitees only – breast cancer patients, survivors, and their families were eligible to attend. Powderfinger performed alongside Silverchair, Missy Higgins, and other artists to an audience of 700. The concert was filmed and later broadcast as a &quot;MAX Session&quot; on Foxtel channel MAX on 3 November.

For the Sunsets Farewell Tour in September 2010, the band promoted another Indigenous cause, the Yalari organisation. The organisation provides Indigenous children with opportunities to get a proper education. In January 2011, following the Queensland flood disaster, [undercover.fm] reported that Powderfinger would not reform for a benefit concert, but the band instead donated a never-before-released track, &quot;I&#x27;m on Your Side&quot;, to help raise money for the victims.

== Personnel ==

Throughout their recording career, Powderfinger consisted of five members: Bernard Fanning as lead vocalist, guitarist, keyboardist, and harmonicist; John Collins as bass guitarist; Ian Haug, originally the lead vocalist until Fanning joined, played lead guitars; Darren Middleton on co-lead guitars, keyboards, backing vocals, and occasional lead vocals; Jon Coghill as drummer and percussionist. Their line-up remained stable from 1992 until their disbandment in November 2010. Steven Bishop had been the group&#x27;s original drummer, but had left to focus on his studies. The band refers to one another by nicknames, including Collins as JC and Coghill as Cogsy.

Powderfinger have collaborated with various artists throughout their career: Pianist Benmont Tench played on &quot;Dream Days at the Hotel Existence&quot;. For touring or session work, auxiliary musicians used include Cameron McKenzie playing guitar as a touring musician filling in for an injured Darren Middleton on both Internationalist national tour and Double Allergic national tour, Alex Pertout on percussion, Duane Billings on percussion, and Lachlan Doley on keyboards. For their second album, &quot;Double Allergic&quot;, the group enlisted Tim Whitten as producer. The group approached American expatriate Nick DiDia as their producer for &quot;Internationalist&quot;, and recorded with him at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne. DiDia also produced the two albums which followed. In 2007, Rob Schnapf, producer for Beck, was asked to produce &quot;Dream Days at the Hotel Existence&quot; in Los Angeles. DiDia returned for &quot;Golden Rule&quot;. Powderfinger&#x27;s first music video, for the song &quot;Reap What You Sow&quot; in 1993, was directed by David Barker, an award-winning director. Film companies who directed other videos for the group include Fifty Fifty Films and Head Pictures.

== Awards and accolades ==
Powderfinger was highly successful in the Australian recording industry, being a recipient of the industry&#x27;s flagship awards, the ARIA Music Awards, 18 times from 47 nominations—the third-highest tally, behind Silverchair&#x27;s 21 wins from 49 nominations and John Farnham&#x27;s 20 wins from 56 nominations. Powderfinger&#x27;s most successful year was 2001 when they won six awards from eight nominations for &quot;Odyssey Number Five&quot; and its related singles. &quot;These Days&quot; and &quot;My Happiness&quot; were ranked at No. 1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 lists in 1999 and 2000, respectively, and 21 other Powderfinger tracks have ranked on lists in other years.

In 2009, as part of the Q150 celebrations, Powderfinger were announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for their role as &quot;Influential Artists&quot;. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1996, they performed &quot;Pick You Up&quot;; in 2019, Dan Condon of Double J rated this as one of the &quot;7 great performances from the history of the ARIA Awards.&quot;

<doc id="461637" wikidata="Q107740285" url="?curid=461637" title="Cumbia">
<text>Cumbia refers to a number of musical rhythms and folk dance traditions of Latin America, generally involving musical and cultural elements from American Indigenous peoples, Europeans and Africans during colonial times. Cumbia is said to have come from funeral traditions in the Afro-Colombian community.

Cumbia traditionally uses three drums (&quot;tambora&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;llamador&quot;), three flutes (&quot;gaita hembra&quot; and &quot;gaito macho&quot;, both forms of , and &quot;flauta de millo&quot;) and has a or meter. The sound of cumbia can be characterized as having a simple &quot;chu-chucu-chu&quot; rhythm created by the guacharaca. The genre frequently incorporates brass instruments and piano.
In order to properly understand the interlocking relationship between cumbia&#x27;s roots, its Pan-American (and then global) routes, and its subgenres, Colombia&#x27;s geocultural complexities must be taken into account.

Most Hispanic American countries have made their own regional version of Cumbia, some of them with their own particularity.

Examples of cumbia include:

* Colombian cumbia is a musical rhythm and traditional folk dance from Colombia. It has elements of three different cultures, American Indigenous, African, and Spanish, being the result of the long and intense meeting of these cultures during the Conquest and the Colony. The Colombian cumbia is the origin of all the other variations, including the tradition of dancing it with candles in the dancers&#x27; hands. 
* Panamanian cumbia, Panamanian folk dance and musical genre, developed by enslaved people of African descent during colonial times and later syncretized with American Indigenous and European cultural elements.

== History of Colombian cumbia ==
Cumbia&#x27;s background came from the coastal region of Colombia. To be more specific, its dance came from a coastal traditional culture, as cumbia had multiple ethnic influences that originated from this region. One of the biggest factors of its heritage is the African influences that was brought over by the African slaves imported from the colonization of the Spaniards. The influence came from the &quot;costeño&quot; dance. Another influence was the integration of Spanish people. The Spanish folksongs with influences from the indigenous caused the fusion of races and &quot;the elements of their cultures were likewise fused.&quot;

The history of cumbia has evolved throughout the years, known as a street dance but had a period of transiting into a ballroom dance. Cumbia is commonly known for having many subgenres from different countries which contributes to the different dance styles known. Cumbia can be referred to as a folk dance while also being known globally as a street dance. To better understand what the dances of cumbia resemble it&#x27;s better to know the basics of the dance. Cumbia is danced in pairs, consisting the amorous conquest of a woman by a man. This is crucial since the dance from the Atlantic coast has the woman holding a candle in her right hand. This serves as two narrative functions; one to light the way for the dancing woman and the latter for a more serious motif. The latter can be portrayed in an imaginative sentence &quot;as a weapon by which the woman defends herself against the advances of her partner.&quot;

Since the 1950s, cumbia has been an art form that is stylized, orchestrated and lyricized, contrary to the traditional form. This has diverged through the years and the world-known genre even had a brief period in the 1970s where it lost its popularity.

== Expansion into Latin America ==
As the genre evolved, it expanded throughout Latin America. The expansion has led to the creation of new variations on the form, and international recognition of the genre changed public perceptions. Cumbia almost disappeared in Colombia in the 1970s after the introduction of salsa. Although that was detrimental it could be argued that cumbia found stability in Central America, Mexico, and Peru. The transformation of cumbia in other countries to better align with the taste of populations with very different aesthetic traditions from the strongly African-derived coastal culture from which it originally emerged. 

Representing cumbia being perceived as expressing the harmonious outcome of racial and cultural blending, this socially affected the public views on the region&#x27;s highly discriminated mestizo working class. Socially and economically some changed their views on mestizos due to cumbia being a large factor in shaping their perspective - except in Argentina, where it&#x27;s still largely seen as vulgar and offensive by much of the middle class and has thus mostly helped reinforce lower class stereotypes.

<doc id="461654" wikidata="Q1856609" url="?curid=461654" title="Scalar potential">
<text>In mathematical physics, scalar potential describes the situation where the difference in the potential energies of an object in two different positions depends only on the positions, not upon the path taken by the object in traveling from one position to the other. It is a scalar field in three-space: a directionless value (scalar) that depends only on its location. A familiar example is potential energy due to gravity.
A &quot;scalar potential&quot; is a fundamental concept in vector analysis and physics (the adjective &quot;scalar&quot; is frequently omitted if there is no danger of confusion with &quot;vector potential&quot;). The scalar potential is an example of a scalar field. Given a vector field , the scalar potential is defined such that: 
formula_1
where is the gradient of and the second part of the equation is minus the gradient for a function of the Cartesian coordinates . In some cases, mathematicians may use a positive sign in front of the gradient to define the potential. Because of this definition of in terms of the gradient, the direction of at any point is the direction of the steepest decrease of at that point, its magnitude is the rate of that decrease per unit length.

In order for to be described in terms of a scalar potential only, any of the following equivalent statements have to be true:
#formula_2 where the integration is over a Jordan arc passing from location to location and is evaluated at location .
#formula_3 where the integral is over any simple closed path, otherwise known as a Jordan curve.
#formula_4
The first of these conditions represents the fundamental theorem of the gradient and is true for any vector field that is a gradient of a differentiable single valued scalar field . The second condition is a requirement of so that it can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function. The third condition re-expresses the second condition in terms of the curl of using the fundamental theorem of the curl. A vector field that satisfies these conditions is said to be irrotational (conservative).
Scalar potentials play a prominent role in many areas of physics and engineering. The gravity potential is the scalar potential associated with the force of gravity per unit mass, or equivalently, the acceleration due to the field, as a function of position. The gravity potential is the gravitational potential energy per unit mass. In electrostatics the electric potential is the scalar potential associated with the electric field, i.e., with the electrostatic force per unit charge. The electric potential is in this case the electrostatic potential energy per unit charge. In fluid dynamics, irrotational lamellar fields have a scalar potential only in the special case when it is a Laplacian field. Certain aspects of the nuclear force can be described by a Yukawa potential. The potential play a prominent role in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics. Further, the scalar potential is the fundamental quantity in quantum mechanics.

Not every vector field has a scalar potential. Those that do are called &quot;conservative&quot;, corresponding to the notion of conservative force in physics. Examples of non-conservative forces include frictional forces, magnetic forces, and in fluid mechanics a solenoidal field velocity field. By the Helmholtz decomposition theorem however, all vector fields can be describable in terms of a scalar potential and corresponding vector potential. In electrodynamics, the electromagnetic scalar and vector potentials are known together as the electromagnetic four-potential.

==Integrability conditions==
If is a conservative vector field (also called &quot;irrotational&quot;, &quot;curl-free&quot;, or &quot;potential&quot;), and its components have continuous partial derivatives, the potential of with respect to a reference point is defined in terms of the line integral:
formula_5
where is a parametrized path from to ,
formula_6

The fact that the line integral depends on the path only through its terminal points and is, in essence, the path independence property of a conservative vector field. The fundamental theorem of line integrals implies that if is defined in this way, then , so that is a scalar potential of the conservative vector field . Scalar potential is not determined by the vector field alone: indeed, the gradient of a function is unaffected if a constant is added to it. If is defined in terms of the line integral, the ambiguity of reflects the freedom in the choice of the reference point .

==Altitude as gravitational potential energy==
An example is the (nearly) uniform gravitational field near the Earth&#x27;s surface. It has a potential energy
formula_7
where is the gravitational potential energy and is the height above the surface. This means that gravitational potential energy on a contour map is proportional to altitude. On a contour map, the two-dimensional negative gradient of the altitude is a two-dimensional vector field, whose vectors are always perpendicular to the contours and also perpendicular to the direction of gravity. But on the hilly region represented by the contour map, the three-dimensional negative gradient of always points straight downwards in the direction of gravity; . However, a ball rolling down a hill cannot move directly downwards due to the normal force of the hill&#x27;s surface, which cancels out the component of gravity perpendicular to the hill&#x27;s surface. The component of gravity that remains to move the ball is parallel to the surface:
formula_8
where is the angle of inclination, and the component of perpendicular to gravity is
formula_9
This force , parallel to the ground, is greatest when is 45 degrees.

Let be the uniform interval of altitude between contours on the contour map, and let be the distance between two contours. Then 
formula_10
so that
formula_11
However, on a contour map, the gradient is inversely proportional to , which is not similar to force : altitude on a contour map is not exactly a two-dimensional potential field. The magnitudes of forces are different, but the directions of the forces are the same on a contour map as well as on the hilly region of the Earth&#x27;s surface represented by the contour map.

==Pressure as buoyant potential==
In fluid mechanics, a fluid in equilibrium, but in the presence of a uniform gravitational field is permeated by a uniform buoyant force that cancels out the gravitational force: that is how the fluid maintains its equilibrium. This buoyant force is the negative gradient of pressure:
formula_12

Since buoyant force points upwards, in the direction opposite to gravity, then pressure in the fluid increases downwards. Pressure in a static body of water increases proportionally to the depth below the surface of the water. The surfaces of constant pressure are planes parallel to the surface, which can be characterized as the plane of zero pressure.

If the liquid has a vertical vortex (whose axis of rotation is perpendicular to the surface), then the vortex causes a depression in the pressure field. The surface of the liquid inside the vortex is pulled downwards as are any surfaces of equal pressure, which still remain parallel to the liquids surface. The effect is strongest inside the vortex and decreases rapidly with the distance from the vortex axis. 

The buoyant force due to a fluid on a solid object immersed and surrounded by that fluid can be obtained by integrating the negative pressure gradient along the surface of the object:
formula_13

==Scalar potential in Euclidean space==
In 3-dimensional Euclidean space , the scalar potential of an irrotational vector field is given by
formula_14
where is an infinitesimal volume element with respect to . Then
formula_15
This holds provided is continuous and vanishes asymptotically to zero towards infinity, decaying faster than and if the divergence of likewise vanishes towards infinity, decaying faster than .

Written another way, let
formula_16
be the Newtonian potential. This is the fundamental solution of the Laplace equation, meaning that the Laplacian of is equal to the negative of the Dirac delta function:
formula_17
Then the scalar potential is the divergence of the convolution of with :
formula_18

Indeed, convolution of an irrotational vector field with a rotationally invariant potential is also irrotational. For an irrotational vector field , it can be shown that 
formula_19
Hence
formula_20
as required.

More generally, the formula
formula_21
holds in -dimensional Euclidean space () with the Newtonian potential given then by
formula_22
where is the volume of the unit -ball. The proof is identical. Alternatively, integration by parts (or, more rigorously, the properties of convolution) gives
formula_23

<doc id="461657" wikidata="Q2335241" url="?curid=461657" title="The Decline of Western Civilization">
<text>The Decline of Western Civilization is a 1981 American documentary filmed through 1979 and 1980. The movie is about the Los Angeles punk rock scene and was directed by Penelope Spheeris. In 1981, the LAPD Chief of Police Daryl Gates wrote a letter demanding the film not be shown again in the city.

The film&#x27;s title is possibly a reference to music critic Lester Bangs&#x27; 1970 two-part review of the Stooges&#x27; album &quot;Fun House&quot;, for &quot;Creem&quot; magazine, where Bangs quotes a friend who had said the popularity of the Stooges signaled &quot;the decline of Western civilization&quot;. Another possibility is that the title refers to Darby Crash&#x27;s reading of Oswald Spengler&#x27;s &quot;Der Untergang des Abendlandes&quot; (&quot;The Decline of the West&quot;). In &quot;We Got the Neutron Bomb&quot;, an oral history of the L.A. punk rock scene collected by Marc Spitz, Claude Bessy aka: Kickboy, claims that he came up with the title.

The film is the opening act of a trilogy by Spheeris, depicting music scenes in Los Angeles during the late 20th century. The second film, &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years&quot; (1988), covers the Los Angeles heavy metal scene of 1987–1988. The third film, &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization Part III&quot; (1998), chronicles the gutter punk lifestyle of homeless teenagers in the late 1990s.

In 2016, &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Featuring concert footage of Los Angeles punk bands and interviews both with band members, the publishers of &quot;Slash&quot; fanzine, and with the punks who made up their audience, the film offers a look into a subculture that was largely ignored by the rock music press of the time.

The promotional poster for &quot;The Decline&quot; (and the record cover of the soundtrack album) featured a close-up frame of Germs singer Darby Crash supine on stage with his eyes closed. Crash died from a heroin-induced suicide shortly before the film was released (the poster was designed before his death).

Bands included are Black Flag, Germs, X, Alice Bag Band, the Circle Jerks, Catholic Discipline, and Fear. The Germs&#x27; performance was replicated in the 2007 Darby Crash biopic &quot;What We Do Is Secret&quot;.

The soundtrack was released in December 1980 by Slash Records on LP. In the late 1990s it was released on CD as well. Germs singer Darby Crash appears on the soundtrack album cover. He died shortly before the film was released, though the promotional images for the film and album release had been designed before his death.

<text>Paradise is an unincorporated community in Whitefish Township, Chippewa County in the U.S. state of Michigan. Paradise is on the northeastern portion of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula, on the western side of Whitefish Bay, Lake Superior, about by road from Sault Ste. Marie and about north of the Mackinac Bridge. Its zip code is 49768, and the area code is 906. Founded in 1925, Paradise is surrounded by state and national forests and its main business is tourism. It is considered one of two gateways to the Tahquamenon Falls area and Tahquamenon Falls State Park. (The other gateway is Newberry, about to the southwest.) The area draws hunters, fishers, campers, backpackers, snowmobilers and birdwatchers. The region harvests blueberries and cranberries in season. It is also the home of the blueberry festival held every summer. Lake Superior shipping lanes are several miles off shore. The Paradise post office opened May 1, 1947.

Paradise is the main point of entry to Whitefish Point, to the north, which is a world migratory route protected by the Seney National Wildlife Refuge, and studied by the Whitefish Point Bird Observatory. It is also known for the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum, its Lake Superior shoreline, the Whitefish Point Lighthouse, and the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve, a series of sunken shipwrecks.
The Sufjan Stevens album &quot;Greetings from Michigan&quot; contains a song entitled &quot;For The Widows In Paradise, For the Fatherless in Ypsilanti.&quot;

The Alex McKnight series of fictional crime books by author Steve Hamilton is set in Paradise, and includes numerous descriptions of the terrain and natural landmarks.

<doc id="461676" wikidata="Q1311704" url="?curid=461676" title="Zachlumia">
<text>Zachlumia or Zachumlia (, ), also Hum, was a medieval principality located in the modern-day regions of Herzegovina and southern Dalmatia (today parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, respectively). In some periods it was a fully independent or semi-independent South Slavic principality. It maintained relations with various foreign and neighbouring powers (Byzantine Empire, First Bulgarian Empire, Kingdom of Croatia, Principality of Serbia) and later was subjected (temporarily or for a longer period) to Kingdom of Hungary, Kingdom of Serbia, Kingdom of Bosnia, and at the end to the Ottoman Empire.

==Etymology==
Zachlumia is a derivative of &quot;Hum&quot;, from Proto-Slavic &quot;&quot;, borrowed from a Germanic language (cf. Proto-Germanic &quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;Hill&quot;. South Slavic &quot;Zahumlje&quot; is named after the mountain of Hum (za + Hum &quot;behind the Hum&quot;), above Bona, at the mouth of the Buna. The principality is named &quot;Zahumlje&quot; or &quot;Hum&quot; in Serbo-Croatian (Serbian Cyrillic: Захумље, Хум). It is &quot;Zachlumia&quot; in Latin, Хлъмъ in Old Church Slavonic, and Ζαχλούμων χώρα (&quot;land of Zachlumians&quot;) in Greek. The names &quot;Chelmania&quot;, &quot;Chulmia&quot; and &quot;terra de Chelmo&quot; appear in later Latin and Italian chronicles.

==Geography==

&quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; described the polity of Zachlumia as: &quot;From Ragusa begins the domain of the Zachlumi (Ζαχλοῦμοι) and stretches along as far as the river Orontius: and on the side of the coast it is neighbour to the Pagani, but on the side of the mountain country it is neighbour to the Croats on the north and to Serbia at the front ... Those who live there now, Zachlumi, are Serbs, from the time of that prince who claimed the protection of the Emperor Heraclius. In the territory of the Zachlumi are the inhabited cities of Stagnon, Mokriskik, Iosli, Galoumainik, Dobriskik&quot;.

The &quot;Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja&quot; (14th or 16th century) described the geography under the rule of the South Slavic (&quot;Red Croatia&quot;) rulers, Hum had two major cities: Bona and Hum. The main settlements in Zachlumia were Ston, Ošlje, Dobar, the towns of Mokriskik and Glumainik. The principality sprang from Dalmatia (Croatia) to the northwest and Pagania to the west; to the mountain of Kalinovik and the Gatačko polje, where it bordered Travunia. The eastern border of Zahumlje went along the line Popovo-Ljubinje-Dabar and met with the Travunian border at the city of Ragusa. Zachlumia was split on 9 zhupanates: Ston, Popovo, Dubrava, Luka, Dabar, Žapska, Gorička and Večenik around Neretva. Zahumlje had access to the Adriatic Sea with the Pelješac peninsula and faced Serbia northwards.

==Slavic settlement==

Slavs invaded Balkans during Justinian I (r. 527–565), when eventually up to 100,000 Slavs raided Thessalonica. The Western Balkans was settled with &quot;Sclaveni&quot; (Sklavenoi), the east with Antes. The Sklavenoi plundered Thrace in 545, and again the next year. In 551, the Slavs crossed Niš initially headed for Thessalonica, but ended up in Dalmatia. In 577 some 100,000 Slavs poured into Thrace and Illyricum, pillaging cities and settling down. Hum had also a large number of Vlachs who were descendent from a pre-Slavic population. Related to Romanians and originally speaking a language related to Romanian, the Vlachs of what was Hum are today Slavic speaking.

==History==
===7th century===

In the second decade of the 7th century, the Avars and their Slavic subjects occupied most of the Byzantine province of Dalmatia, including the territory of what would become Zahumlje, sacking towns and enslaving or displacing the local population. Some of the Slavs and Avars might have permanently settled in the occupied areas. They attacked Constantinople in 626 but were defeated by the Byzantines, after which the Avars ceased to play a significant role in the Balkans.

Around 630, during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, Serbs and Croats (Slavic tribes) led by their respective aristocracies entered the western Balkans from the north, which was approved by the emperor. They inhabited areas that had been devastated by the Avars, where Byzantium (East Roman Empire) had generally been reduced to only nominal rule. According to &quot;DAI&quot;, Zahumlje was one of the regions settled by the Serbs from an area near Thessaloniki who previously arrived there from White Serbia, but a closer reading of the source suggests that the Constantine VII&#x27;s consideration about the population&#x27;s ethnic identity is based on Serbian political rule and influence during the time of Časlav of Serbia and does not indicate ethnic origin. According to Noel Malcolm, today&#x27;s western Serbia was area where Serbs settled in 7th century and from there they expanded their rule on territory of Zachlumia. According to Tibor Živković the area of the Vistula where the Litziki ancestors of Michael of Zahumlje originate was the place where White Croats would be expected and not White Serbs, and it&#x27;s unclear whether the Zachlumians &quot;in the migration period to the Balkans really were Serbs or Croats or Slavic tribes which in alliance with Serbs or Croats arrived in the Balkans&quot;. According to Francis Dvornik the Zachlumians &quot;had a closer bond of interest with the Croats than with the Serbs, since they seem to have migrated to their new home not with the Serbs, but with the Croats&quot;. Michael&#x27;s tribal origin is related to the oral tradition from &quot;Historia Salonitana&quot; by Thomas the Archdeacon about seven or eight tribes of nobles called &quot;Lingones&quot; who arrived from Poland and settled in Croatia. Much of Dalmatia was sometime earlier settled by the Croats, and Zahumlje bordered their territory on the north. According to Thomas the Archdeacon, when describing the reign of Croatian king Stephen Držislav in the late 10th century, notes that Duchy of Hum (Zachlumia or Chulmie) was a part of the Kingdom of Croatia, before and after Stjepan Držislav:

===9th century===

Charlemagne, King of the Franks from 768 until his death in 814, expanded the Frankish kingdom into an empire (800) that incorporated much of western and central Europe. He brought the Frankish state face to face with the West Slavs to the northeast and the Avars and South Slavs to the southeast of the Frankish empire. Dalmatia which was southeast of the Frankish empire, was chiefly in the hands of South Slavic tribes. North of Dubrovnik these came to be under Croatian &quot;župans&quot; (princes) and eventually came to consider themselves Croatians, while many of those to the south of Dubrovnik were coming to consider themselves Serbs. Despite Frankish overlordship, the Franks had almost no role in Dalmatia (Dalmatian Croatia and Zahumlje) in the period from the 820s through 840s.

In 866, a major Arab raid along Dalmatia struck Budva and Kotor, and then laid siege to Dubrovnik in 867. The city of Dubrovnik appealed to Byzantine Emperor Basil the Macedonian, who responded by sending over one hundred ships. Finally, the 866–867 Saracens&#x27; siege of Dubrovnik, which lasted fifteen months, was raised due to the intervention of Basil I, who sent a fleet under the command of Niketas Oryphas in relief of the city. After this successful intervention, the Byzantine navy sailed along the coast collecting promises of loyalty to the empire from the Dalmatian cities. At this moment the local Slavic tribes (in Zahumlje, Travunija, and Konavle), who had aided the intervention, also accepted Byzantine suzerainty. Afterwards, the Slavs of Dalmatia and Zahumlje took part in the Byzantine military actions against the Arabs in Bari in 870–871. The Roman cities in Dalmatia had long been pillaged by the Slavic tribes in the mountaines around them. Basil I allowed the towns to pay tribute to the Slavic tribes to reduce the Slavs raiding. Presumably a large portion of this tribute went to the prince of Dalmatian Croatia. In late 870s, the theme of Dalmatia (&quot;thema Dalmatias&quot;) was established, but with no real Byzantine authority. These small cities in the region (also Dyrrachium) did not stretch into the hinterlands, and had none military capacity, thus Basil I paid a tax of &#x27;72 gold coins&#x27; to the princes of Zahumlje and Travunia.

In 879, the Pope asked for help from duke Zdeslav Trpimirović for an armed escort for his delegates across southern Dalmatia and Zahumlje. Later in 880, the Pope ask the same from Zdeslav&#x27;s successor, prince Branimir.

===10th century===
The history of Zahumlje as a greater political entity starts with the emerging of Michael of Zahumlje, an independent South Slavic ruler who flourished in the early part of the 10th century. A neighbour of Croatian Kingdom and Principality of Serbia as well as an ally of Bulgaria, he was nevertheless able to maintain independent rule throughout at least a good part of his reign.

Michael have come into territorial conflict with the neighbouring prince Peter Gojniković, the ruler of inner Serbia, who was extending his power westwards. To eliminate that threat and as a close ally of Bulgaria, Michael warned the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I about the alliance between Peter and Symeon&#x27;s enemy, the Byzantine Empire. In 912 Michael kidnapped the Venetian Doge&#x27;s son Peter Badoari that was returning to Venice from Constantinople and sent him to Czar Simeon as a sign of loyalty. Symeon attacked inner Serbia and captured Peter, who later died in prison, and Michael was able to restore the majority of control.

The &quot;Historia Salonitana maior&quot;, whose composition may have begun in the late 13th century, cites a letter of Pope John X to Tomislav, &quot;king (&quot;rex&quot;) of the Croats&quot;, in which he refers to the first council in some detail. If the letter is authentic, it shows that the council was attended not only by the bishops of Croatian and Byzantine Dalmatia, but also by Tomislav, whose territory also included the Byzantine cities of Dalmatia, and by a number of Michael&#x27;s representatives. Zahumlje may have been under Croatian influence, but remained a separate political entity. Both Zahumlje and Croatia were under the religious jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Split. In this letter, John describes Michael as &quot;the most excellent leader of the Zachlumi&quot; (&quot;excellentissimus dux Chulmorum&quot;), and is mentioned the Ston bishopric (&quot;ecclesia Stagnensis&quot;) which jurisdiction remained under Split until 1022. It is uncertain whether the inscription and depiction of a Slavic ruler in the Church of St. Michael in Ston is a reference to Michael of Zahumlje, the 12th century Mihailo I of Duklja or St. Michael himself.

After the Italian city of Siponto () was heavily jeopardized by the raiding Arabs and Langobards, Mihailo won a magnificent military victory by taking the city upon the recommendations from Constantinople and orders from his ally, King Tomislav Trpimirovic, but didn&#x27;t keep it permanently. Mihailo Višević entered into closer relations with the Byzantine Empire, after the death of Bulgaria&#x27;s Tsar Simeon. He gained the grand titles of the Byzantine court as &quot;anthypatos&quot; and patrician (&quot;patrikios&quot;). He remained as ruler of Zahumlje into the 940s, while maintaining good relations with the Papacy.

====Post-Michael of Zahumlje period====
After the death of Michael (after c. 930s or 940s), the fate of Zahumlje is uncertain due to lack of historical sources about it. Some historians believe that Zahumlje came under the rule of prince Časlav of Serbia, but there&#x27;s no evidence for it and &quot;DAI&quot; which was written in the mid-10th century clearly states that Zachlumia is a separate polity from Serbia. The 13th century Thomas the Archdeacon claimed that the Croatian kingdom included Zachlumia before and after Stephen Držislav (969–997), but that&#x27;s also disputable.

In the late 990s, Bulgarian Tsar Samuel made client states out of most of the Balkans, including Duklja and Zahumlje. In 998, Samuel launched a major campaign against Jovan Vladimir to prevent a Byzantine-Serbian alliance, resulting in a surrender. The Bulgarian troops proceeded to pass through Dalmatia, taking control of Kotor and journeying to Dubrovnik. Although they failed to take Dubrovnik, they devastated the surrounding villages. The Bulgarian army then attacked Croatia in support of the rebel princes Krešimir III and Gojslav and advanced northwest as far as Split, Trogir and Zadar, then northeast through Bosnia and Raška and returned to Bulgaria.

===11th century===
By 1020, Byzantine Emperor Basil I expanded control in the whole region, but the Byzantines used local elite to rule over local polities although under Byzantine vassalage and supervision of Byzantine officials. In the Pope Benedict VIII&#x27;s bull from 27 September 1022 is mentioned Zahumlje kingdom (&quot;regno Lachomis&quot;), and would be again in the bull of Pope Gregory VII from 1076 (as &quot;regno Zaculmi&quot;), which confirmed the jurisdiction of the archdiocese of Dubrovnik.

In a charter dated July 1039, Ljutovid of Zahumlje who was an independent Slavic ruler of Zahumlje, styled himself &quot;Ljutovit, protospatharios epi tou Chrysotriklinou, hypatos, strategos&quot; of Serbia and Zahumlje. According to historian Paul Stephenson, it &quot;suggests that he had been courted by the emperor, and awarded nominal rights neighbouring lands, including Duklja, which was at the time at war with the empire. 

According to historical sources, the Serbian lands were under Byzantine control or vassalage until 1040s, but not under a direct control. Vojislav of Duklja (fl. 1018–1043) soon took Zahumlje from the Byzantines. During the rule of Constantine Bodin (r. 1081–1101), neither Bosnia, Serbia nor Zahumlje was ever integrated into Doclea, each retained its own nobility and institutions and simply acquired a Vojislavljević to head the local structure as Prince or Duke. Zahumlje subsequently became part of the Grand Principality of Serbia.

===12th century===

Kočapar, the Prince of Duklja (r. 1102–1103), ruled in the name of Vukan I of Serbia. There was a split between the two, and Vukan sent forces to Duklja, making Kočapar flee to Bosnia and then Zahumlje, where he died. Zavida ruled Zahumlje before getting into a conflict with his brothers, resulting in him being exiled to Duklja, where he would have the title of &quot;Lord of Ribnica&quot;. &quot;Grand Princes&quot; Desa (r. 1148–1162) and Uroš II Prvoslav ruled Serbia together 1149–1153; Desa had the title of &#x27;Prince of Duklja, Travunija and Zahumlje&#x27;, mentioned in 1150 and 1151.

About 1150, the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos displeased with king Radoslav of Duklja, divided up his lands between princes of the old Serbian family of Zavida, and Stefan Nemanja secured the land of Hum. After 1168 when Nemanja was raised to the Serbian throne with Manuel&#x27;s favor, Hum passed to his brother Miroslav. He married a sister of Ban Kulin, who in meantime acquired the throne of Bosnia. The subjects of Miroslav and Kulin included both Catholic and Orthodox. Prince Miroslav himself was Orthodox. In meantime, both Bosnia and Hum had been fought between Kingdom of Hungary and Byzantine Empire. The Catholics supported the former and the Orthodox the latter. A support of the growing heresy seemed the best solution for both Kulin and Miroslav.
Following the death of Emperor Manuel in 1180 Miroslav started ecclesiastical superior of Hum. He refused to allow Rainer, Latin Archbishop of Spalato (Split) whom he considered to be an agent of Hungarian king, to consecrate a bishop for the town of Ston. In addition, Miroslav confiscated the Archbishop&#x27;s money. Rainer complained to the Pope Alexander III, who sent Teobald to report on the matter. The Pope&#x27;s nuncio Teobald found Miroslav as a patron of heretics. After this, the Pope wrote to king Béla III of Hungary who was overlord of Hum (which Miroslav did not recognize), telling him to see that Miroslav performed his duty, but Miroslav remained as &quot;Prince of Hum&quot;. In 1190–1192, Stefan Nemanja briefly assigned the rule of Hum to his son Rastko Nemanjić, while Miroslav held the Lim region with Bijelo Polje. Rastko however took monastic vows and Miroslav continued ruling Hum after 1192.

Latin vengeance came in March 1198, when Andrew II of Hungary become the prince of Dalmatia, Croatia and Hum, while Miroslav died a year after and his wife was living in exile. The Miroslav Gospels are the oldest surviving documents written in Serbian recension of Old Church Slavonic, very likely produced for the Church of St Peter in Lima, commissioned by prince Miroslav.

===13th century===

Until beginning of the 13th century, areas of Zahumlje were under jurisdiction of the Roman Church. When Sava became the first archbishop of Serbia in 1219, he appointed Ilarion as the Orthodox bishop of Hum.

Andrija Mirosavljević is entitled the rule of Hum, but the Hum nobility chose his brother Petar. Andrija is exiled to Rascia, to the court of his cousin Grand Prince Stefan Nemanjić. In the meantime, Petar fought successfully with neighbouring Bosnia and Croatia. Stefan Nemanjić sided with Andrija and went to war and secured Hum and Popovo field for Andrija sometime after his accession. Petar was defeated and crossed the Neretva, continuing to rule the west and north of the Neretva, which had around 1205 been briefly occupied by Andrew II of Hungary. Toljen II, the son of Toljen Mirosavljević, succeeded as prince, ruling 1227–1237. Andrija&#x27;s sons Bogdan, Radoslav and George succeed as princes of Hum in 1249, Radoslav held the supreme rule. During the war against Ragusa, he aided his kinsman Stephen Uroš I of Serbia, at the same time swearing allegiance to Béla IV of Hungary. Following an earthquake in the Hum capital of Ston, the Serbian Orthodox bishop of Hum moved to the church of St Peter and St Paul built on the Lim River near the Serbian border in the 1250s.

Radoslav of Zahumlje was from 1254 a vassal of Hungary, but probably afterwards his land were absorbed into Serbia. However, he was at war with Serbia in 1268, while still under Hungarian suzerainty. But seeking to centralize his realm, Stephen Uroš I of Serbia tried to stamp out regional differences by dropping references to Zahumlje (Hum), Trebinje and Duklja (Zeta), and called himself &quot;King of all Serbian land and the Coast&quot;. Miroslav&#x27;s descendants dropped to the level of other local nobles.

===14th century===
Paul I Šubić of Bribir as Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia controlled Croatia from Gvozd Mountain to the river Neretva mouth. Paul became Lord of all of Bosnia in 1299. Although supporting the king, Paul continued to act independently, and ruled over a large portion of modern-day Croatia and Bosnia. In the course of the war between Stephen Uroš II Milutin and Stephen Dragutin, Paul Šubić expanded not only into western Hum, but also beyond the Neretva river, and took the region of Nevesinje and Ston. Paul appointed his eldest son, Mladen II, as Lord of Hum. At least part of Paul&#x27;s conquests were granted to his vassal Constantine Nelipčić. Mladen succeeded his father in 1312. After Paul&#x27;s death, Milutin and Dragutin concluded a peace, and went to war against the Šubić family. In the war that followed Milutin took one of Mladen&#x27;s brother captive, and to get him back Mladen Šubić had to agree to restore a part of Hum to Milutin. After this agreement in 1313 the Neretva again became the border between eastern and western Hum.

By 1325, the Branivojević family had emerged as strongest in Hum. Probably at their highest point they ruled from Cetina River to the town of Kotor. Though nominal vassals of Serbia, the Branivojević family attacked Serbian interests and other local nobles of Hum, who in 1326 turned against Serbia and Branivojević family. The Hum nobles approached to Stjepan Kotromanić II, the ban of Bosnia, who then annexed most of Hum. The Draživojevići of Nevesinje as vassals of Bosnian Ban, become the leading family of Hum in the 1330s. Because of the war in 1327-1328 between Serbia and Dubrovnik, Bosnian lordship of inner Hum and the war in Macedonia, Stephen Uroš IV Dušan sold Ston and Pelješac to Dubrovnik, and turned to the east to acquire all of Macedonia.

The region was overwhelmed by the House of Kotromanić from Bosnia in 1322–1326. By the mid-14th century, Bosnia apparently reached a peak under Ban Tvrtko I who came into power in 1353.

===15th century===

In the beginning of the 15th century, Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić ruled over the western Hum, and Sandalj Hranić Kosača ruled over its eastern part, while the Neretva river remain a border between their possessions.

The territory on the right bank of the Lower Neretva was at the time controlled by Kosača vassals, a local clan and magnates of Radivojević–Jurjević–Vlatković.

Bosnian regional lord Stjepan Vukčić Kosača ruled over Zahumlje, or Humska zemlja as it was called at this point. In 1448 he assumed the title &quot;herzog&quot; and styled himself &quot;Herzog of Hum and the Coast, Grand Duke of Bosnia, Knyaz of Drina, and the rest,&quot; and since 1450, &quot;Herzog of Saint Sava, Lord of Hum, Grand Duke of Bosnia, Knyaz of Drina, and the rest&quot;. This &quot;Saint Sava&quot; part of the title had considerable public relations value, because Sava&#x27;s relics were consider miracle-working by people of all Christian faiths. Stjepan&#x27;s title will prompt the Ottomans to start calling &quot;Humska zemlja&quot; by using the possessive form of the noun &quot;Herceg&quot;, &quot;Herceg&quot;&#x27;s land(s) (Herzegovina), which remains a long-lasting legacy in the name of Bosnia and Herzegovina to this day.

In 1451 he attacked Dubrovnik, and laid siege to the city. He had earlier been made a Ragusan nobleman and, consequently, the Ragusan government now proclaimed him a traitor. A reward of 15,000 ducats, a palace in Dubrovnik worth 2,000 ducats, and an annual income of 300 ducats was offered to anyone who would kill him, along with the promise of hereditary Ragusan nobility which also helped hold this promise to whoever did the deed. Stjepan was so scared by the threat that he finally raised the siege.

==Demographics==

===12th–13th centuries===
Most of Hum&#x27;s territory was inhabited by Slavs, and Vlachs, and belonged to the Eastern Church after the Great Schism. Hum&#x27;s coastal region, including its capital Ston, had a mixed population of Catholics and Orthodox.

===14th–15th centuries===
In contrast to Bosnia, where Roman Catholicism and Bosnian Church were firmly established, eastern parts of Hum was mostly Orthodox, from 13th century and the rise of Nemanjići. In the 14th- and 15th centuries, there was an influx of settlers from the &quot;župa&quot; of Trebinje, around forts Klobuk, Ledenica and Rudina, and the &quot;Hum lands&quot; around Gacko and Dabar, to Kotor. The people from Hum were mostly girls from Gacko, who took up working as servants to wealthy families.

<text>The Dual Contracts, also known as the Dual Subway System, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The contracts were signed on March 19, 1913, by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company. As part of the Dual Contracts, the IRT and BRT would build or upgrade several subway lines in New York City, then operate them for 49 years.

Most of the lines of the present-day New York City Subway were built or reconstructed under these contracts. The contracts were &quot;dual&quot; in that they were signed between the City and two separate private companies. Both the IRT and BRT (later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, or BMT) worked together to make the construction of the Dual Contracts possible.

==Background==
In the late 19th century and for most of the 20th century, New York was host to millions of immigrants each year. Many of the immigrants crowded into tenements and other apartment buildings in the inner city. This resulted in overpopulation of the buildings, and congestion of city streets. Manhattan&#x27;s population had risen from 516,000 people in 1850 to 2.33 million people in 1910. The population of the entire city had grown from 1.17 million people in 1860 to 3.44 million in 1900 and 4.77 million in 1910. Living in Manhattan was becoming a hazard due to the higher probability of crime and overcrowding, and for the most part, the first subway line only served areas that were already developed. The first subway lines to the outer boroughs were planned during the early 20th century. Dispersion resulted in the expansion and development of the boroughs.

In 1906, Charles Evans Hughes was elected as the governor of New York, and the next year, he created the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC). The PSC was responsible for new rapid transit lines in New York City. Although the PSC had created ambitious plans for the expansion of the city&#x27;s subway system, they only had $200 million on hand. In 1911, George McAneny was appointed leader of the Transit Committee of the New York City Board of Estimate, which oversaw the subway expansion plans.

Some opposed the Dual Contracts as they thought that the company owners and city officials were just looking for another way to produce personal revenue. Reformists like Hughes and McAneny would not have it any other way than to see the expansion of the city and the subway. They wanted to see the inner city become less populated and spread the people to the outer boroughs of the city. They planned to expand the city and disperse the people by building subway lines which would hopefully result in new homes being built near the subway lines and the areas surrounding. This would lower population densities in the city and also made as a good reason to help prove the subway expansion as necessary.

===Crowding===
Before the Contracts, there was crowding in many of the forms of transportation in the city. The following is a list of annual ridership for each mode of transportation between June 30, 1910, and June 30, 1911:

*Interborough Rapid Transit Company–subways, elevated roads — 578,154,088
*Hudson and Manhattan Railroad — 52,756,434
*Brooklyn Union Elevated Railroad System — 167,371,328
*East River ferries — 23,460,000
*Municipal ferry to Staten Island — 10,540,000
*Hudson River ferries — 91,776,200

In total, 924,058,050 passengers were carried that year over these six modes of transport.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that streetcar ridership had increased more than 25 times over between 1860, where there were 50.83 million annual riders, and 1910, where there were 1.531 billion annual riders.

===Planned effects===
It was expected that, within five years of completion:

When completed, the rapid transit facilities of the City will have been more than trebled. During the year ended June 30, 1911, shortly after which the construction of the new system was begun, the existing rapid transit lines carried 798,281,850 passengers. The new Dual System will have a capacity of upwards of [3 billion], although it is not expected that such capacity will be demanded immediately upon the completion of the system.

The combined trackage of the existing lines (including 7.1 miles of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad) amounts to 303 miles of single track. To this will be added by the new lines of the Dual System 334 miles of single track, making a new system with 637 miles of single track. What this will mean to the City may be appreciated by considering how the existing lines will be amplified by the new additions and extensions. The Hudson and Manhattan road, however, is not to be a part of the Dual System.

This system expansion was expected to be as big as, if not bigger, than the proposed Second System expansion put forth by the Independent Subway System in 1929 and 1939.

==Contracts==
===Contracts 1 and 2===

Built before the Dual Contracts, the first regularly operated subway in New York City was built by the city and leased to the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) for operation under city Contracts 1 and 2. Until 1918, when the new &quot;H&quot; system that is still operated – with separate East Side and West Side lines – was placed in service, it consisted of a single trunk line below 96th Street with several northern branches. The system had four tracks between Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall and 96th Street, allowing for local and express service on that portion.

Contract 1 was for the original 28 stations of the subway system that opened on October 27, 1904, from City Hall to 145th Street, as well as for stations opened before 1908 on several IRT extensions. The original system as included in Contract 1 was completed on January 14, 1907, when trains started running across the Harlem Ship Canal on the Broadway Bridge to 225th Street, and the Contract 2 portion was opened to Atlantic Avenue on May 1, 1908.

===Contracts 3 and 4===
The Dual Contracts were signed on March 19, 1913. The contracts bound Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; later BMT) to build and operate lines for 49 years. Contract 3 was signed between the City and the IRT. Contract 4 was signed between the City and the Municipal Railway Company, a subsidiary of the BRT, formed especially for the purpose of contracting with the city for construction of the lines.

Under the terms of Contracts 3 and 4, the city would build new subway and elevated lines, and rehabilitate and expand certain existing elevated lines, and lease them to the private companies for operation. The expansions would total of new trackage across both systems; by comparison, the existing systems had of tracks. The city&#x27;s third major rapid transit company, the Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad (now PATH), was excluded from the contracts. The projected $337 million cost would be borne mostly by the City, which was to pay $226 million, and the companies would pay the difference. The City&#x27;s contribution was in cash raised by bond offerings, while the companies&#x27; contributions were variously by supplying cash, facilities and equipment to run the lines.

===Queensboro Plaza===

The contract negotiations were long and sometimes acrimonious. For instance, when the IRT was reluctant to cede the BRT&#x27;s proposed access to Midtown Manhattan via the Broadway Line, the city and state negotiators immediately offered the BRT &quot;all&quot; of the lines under proposal. This included lines that would have only been operable using IRT rolling stock dimensions, such as the upper Lexington Avenue Line and both lines in Queens. The IRT quickly gave in to the &quot;invasion&quot; of Midtown Manhattan by the BRT.

The assignment of the proposed lines in Queens proved to be an imposition on both companies. Instead of one company enjoying a monopoly in that borough, both proposed lines—a short line to Astoria, and a longer line reaching initially to Corona, and eventually to Flushing—were assigned to &quot;both&quot; companies, to be operated in what was called &quot;joint service&quot;. The lines would start from a large interchange station, Queensboro Plaza. The IRT would access the station from both the 1907 Steinway Tunnel and an extension of the Second Avenue Elevated from Manhattan over the Queensboro Bridge. The BRT would feed the Queens lines from the 60th Street Tunnel in Manhattan. Technically the line was under IRT &quot;ownership&quot;, but the BRT/BMT was granted trackage rights in perpetuity, essentially making it theirs also.

The BRT had a big disadvantage, as both Queens lines were built to IRT specifications. This meant that IRT passengers had a one-seat ride to Manhattan destinations, whereas BRT passengers had to make a change at Queensboro Plaza. This came to be important when service was extended for the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, as the IRT was able to offer direct express trains from Manhattan, and the BRT was not. This practice lasted well into the municipal ownership of the lines, and was not ended until 1949. Both companies shared in the revenues from this service. To facilitate this arrangement originally, extra long platforms were constructed along both Queens routes, so separate fare controls/boarding areas could be established. This quickly turned out to be operationally unworkable, so eventually a proportionate formula was worked out. The bonus legacy of this construction was that the IRT was able to operate 11-car trains on this line, and when the BMT took over the Astoria Line, minimal work had to be done to accommodate 10-car BMT units.

==Conditions==


Several provisions were imposed on the companies, which eventually led to their downfall and consolidation into city ownership in 1940:
*The fare was limited to five cents; that led to financial troubles for the two companies after post-World War I inflation. The BMT could charge ten cents for fare to Coney Island Terminal, as well as to stations &quot;where such ten cent fare is now allowed, until the time when trains may be operated for continuous trips over wholly connected portions of the railroad&quot; between Coney Island and the Chambers Street station in Manhattan.
*The City had the right to &quot;recapture&quot; any of the lines it built and run them as its own.
*The City was to share in the profits.

There were other conditions in regards to specific operations of the lines, as part of a deal between the IRT, the BMT, and the Public Service Commission. Many of the conditions applied all across the dual system. For example:
* After the Commission finished constructing the line, the company was to operate it, providing its own rolling stock and furnishings.
* The companies, if they operated lines temporarily, had to operate them as if they were subway extensions. For subway extensions, if a company accepted the extension, it could operate it as part of its system; if not, the company had to pay a significant amount to the city every three months to operate it. This was implemented as part of the Queensboro Plaza trackage-sharing operation.
* The companies had operated these lines &quot;according to the highest standards of railway operation and with due regard to the safety of the passengers and employees thereof, and of all other persons.&quot;
* Free transfers would be given at stations where needed, such as transfer stations between lines of the IRT and BMT, bus–subway transfer stations, elevated–subway transfer stations, or streetcar–subway transfer stations, according to the Commission&#x27;s discretion.
* Freight, mail and express trains could use these companies&#x27; tracks if they did not disrupt passenger operations.
* Advertising was prohibited in stations, railroad tunnels, elevated structures, or other places. Bulletins telling of service changes were allowed. 
* Selling things in the stations was prohibited, except if it needed for the operation of the subway, or if it was a newspaper, periodical, or magazine that the Commission had permitted.
* Each company was to post their intentions to operate newsstands in the form of proposals to the Commission.

Some conditions applied only to certain parts of the system:
*The BMT agreed to hand out transfers at the 86th Street/Gravesend station in Brooklyn to the Third Avenue Line and the Fifth Avenue Line streetcar lines to 86th Street and Fort Hamilton Parkway. They were also to extend these streetcar lines to 86th Street and Fourth Avenue, where a transfer could be made at the 86th Street/Fourth Avenue station.
*The BMT also agreed to make transfers with the Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad from the 34th Street subway station to the 33rd Street H&amp;M station. The transfers applied to passengers going to Grand Central Terminal, since the H&amp;M had originally planned an extension there.
*The IRT agreed to equip and operate the Steinway Tunnel until it was rebuilt and completed. Then, the Steinway Tunnel was still a trolley tunnel with no subway connection. Transfers were to be made to IRT rapid transit lines at the Grand Central–42nd Street station. The Commission approved single-car rolling stock for the line.

==IRT lines==
Under the original system, the original line and early extensions built for the IRT are:
*Eastern Parkway Line from Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center to Borough Hall
*Lexington Avenue Line from Borough Hall to Grand Central–42nd Street
*42nd Street Shuttle from Grand Central–42nd Street to Times Square
*Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from Times Square to Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street
*Lenox Avenue Line from 96th Street to 145th Street
*White Plains Road Line from 142nd Street Junction to 180th Street–Bronx Park (removed north of 179th Street)

The following lines were built under the Dual Contracts for the IRT:
*Astoria Line and Flushing Line
*Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line south of Times Square–42nd Street, including the Brooklyn Branch
*Lexington Avenue Line north of Grand Central–42nd Street
*Jerome Avenue Line
*Ninth Avenue Line from 155th Street to the Jerome Avenue Line
*Pelham Line
*White Plains Road Line north of 177th Street (present-day Tremont Avenue)
*Eastern Parkway Line beyond Atlantic Avenue
*Nostrand Avenue Line
*New Lots Line

The following lines were rebuilt with extra tracks:
*Ninth Avenue Line from Rector Street to 155th Street (one new track)
*Second Avenue and Third Avenue Lines from City Hall station to 129th Street and from 116th Street to 155th Street, respectively.
Some of the IRT lines proposed under the Contracts were not built. Most notably, there were plans to build an IRT line to Marine Park, Brooklyn (at what is now Kings Plaza) under either Utica Avenue, using a brand-new line, or Nostrand Avenue and Flatbush Avenue, using the then-new IRT Nostrand Avenue Line. There were also alternate plans for the Nostrand Avenue Line to continue down Nostrand Avenue to Sheepshead Bay.

==BMT lines==
All Manhattan and Queens BMT lines were built under the Dual Contracts, as were all subway and some elevated lines in Brooklyn.

===Newly built lines and line segments===
*14th Street Eastern Line west of Broadway Junction; two-tracked underground structure
*Astoria Line and Flushing Line east of Queensboro Plaza (trackage rights over IRT); both three-track elevated structures
*Broadway Line; four-track underground structure
*Brighton Beach Line between DeKalb Avenue and Prospect Park
*Fourth Avenue Line; underground structure with four tracks north of 59th Street and two tracks south of 59th Street
*Fulton Street Line east of Grant Avenue; three-track elevated structure
*Jamaica Line east of Cypress Hills; two-track elevated structure
*Manhattan Bridge tracks and approaches
*Nassau Street Line between Chambers Street to a merge with the Montague Street Tunnel to Brooklyn

===Grade-separated rights-of-way built to replace surface railroads===
*Brighton Beach Line between Neptune Avenue (south of Sheepshead Bay) and Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue. Four-track elevated structure.
*Culver Line between Ninth Avenue and West Eighth Street (merge with Brighton Beach Line). Three-track elevated structure.
*Myrtle Avenue Line east of Myrtle–Wyckoff Avenues. Two-track elevated structure.
*Sea Beach Line from Fourth Avenue Subway to 86th Street. Four-track open cut.
*West End Line between Ninth Avenue and Bay 50th Street. Three-track elevated structure.

===Existing rights-of-way rehabilitated and expanded===
*Brighton Beach Line from Prospect Park to Church Avenue. Existing open cut widened and expanded from two to four tracks.
*Jamaica Line from merge with line from Marcy Avenue to Broadway Junction. Elevated line expanded from two to three tracks.
*Myrtle Avenue Line from Broadway–Myrtle to Myrtle–Wyckoff Avenues, including track connection to Jamaica Line. Elevated structure expanded from two to three tracks.
*Fulton Street Line from Nostrand Avenue to east of split from Canarsie Line at Pitkin Avenue. Two track elevated expanded to three tracks and new flying junction complex with six tracks replaced two tracks between former Manhattan Junction in East New York and Pitkin Avenue. This portion gave the Canarsie Line two dedicated tracks.

== Effects==
As reformists predicted, the Dual Contracts resulted in city expansion. People moved to the newly built homes along the newly built subway lines. These homes were affordable, about the same cost as the houses in Brooklyn and Manhattan. The Dual Contracts were the key to dispersion of the city&#x27;s congested areas. The Dual Contracts helped lower high population areas and probably helped save lives as people were no longer living in heavily diseased areas. According to the Federal Census of New York City for 1920 the population in Manhattan below 59th Street decreased from 1910 to 1920. The census resulted in the following:
*1905 State census: 1,271,848
*1910 United States census: 1,269,591
*1915 State census: 1,085,308
*1920 United States census: 1,059,589
People were allowed to move to better parts the same cost and could have a better and more comfortable life in the suburbs. They could still commute to work every day as most of the better off city workers who moved to the outer boroughs did. This also helped the business districts as people could still work.

<text>Tirana Year Zero (&quot;Tirana, année zéro&quot;), is a 2001 Albanian film produced, written and directed by Fatmir Koçi. It tells the story of a young couple in post-communist Albania, at a time when many Albanians left the country in search for a better life abroad.

==Plot==
The protagonist of the movie is Nik, who lives in the capital of Albania, Tirana, along with his mother and father. He is in love with a beautiful girl named Klara, who wants to move to Paris to be a model. Nik makes his living with an old truck that belonged to his father, who is now sick, and seemingly dying. 

Amidst the criticisms of his mother, the confusion and desperation covering the country, and the desire of his girlfriend to leave, Nik is still unsure whether he wants to leave. The film explores the way Nik handles the events of his life.

==Awards==
The film appeared in competition at several film festivals, including Venice (2001); Sarlat, Amiens and Strasbourg; Namur, where it received the SACD prize; and Thessaloniki, where it won the first prize, the Golden Alexander.

<text>The Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) was the private operator of New York City&#x27;s original underground subway line that opened in 1904, as well as earlier elevated railways and additional rapid transit lines in New York City. The IRT was purchased by the city on June 12, 1940, along with the younger BMT and IND systems, to form the modern New York City Subway. The former IRT lines (the numbered routes in the current subway system) are now the A Division or IRT Division of the Subway.

== History ==
The first IRT subway ran between City Hall and 145th Street at Broadway, opening on October 27, 1904. It opened following more than twenty years of public debate on the merits of subways versus the existing elevated rail system and on various proposed routes.

Founded on May 6, 1902, by August Belmont, Jr., the IRT&#x27;s mission was to operate New York City&#x27;s initial underground rapid transit system after Belmont&#x27;s and John B. McDonald&#x27;s Rapid Transit Construction Company was awarded the rights to build the railway line in 1900, outbidding Andrew Onderdonk. The Manhattan Railway Company was the operator of four elevated railways in Manhattan with an extension into the Bronx. 

On April 1, 1903, over a year before its first subway line opened, the IRT acquired the Manhattan Railway Company by lease, gaining a monopoly on rapid transit in Manhattan. The IRT coordinated some services between what became its subway and elevated divisions, but all the lines of the former Manhattan elevateds have since been dismantled.

In 1913, as a result of massive expansion in the city, the IRT signed the Dual Contracts with Brooklyn Rapid Transit (BRT) in order to expand the subway. The agreement also locked the subway fare at 5 cents for forty-nine years. The IRT unsuccessfully attempted to raise the fare to seven cents in 1929, in a case that went to the United States Supreme Court.

The IRT ceased to function as a privately held company on June 12, 1940, when its properties and operations were acquired by the City of New York.

Today, the IRT lines are operated as the A Division of the subway. The remaining lines are underground in Manhattan, except for a short stretch across Harlem at 125th Street and in northern Manhattan. Its many lines in the Bronx are predominantly elevated, with some subway, and some railroad-style right-of-way acquired from the defunct New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, which now constitutes the IRT Dyre Avenue Line. Its Brooklyn lines are underground with a single elevated extension that reaches up to New Lots Avenue, and the other reaching Flatbush Avenue via the underground Nostrand Avenue Line. 

The Flushing Line, its sole line in Queens, is entirely elevated except for a short portion approaching its East River tunnel and its terminal at Flushing–Main Street (the whole Manhattan portion of the line is underground). The Flushing Line has had no track connection to the rest of the IRT since 1942, when service on the Second Avenue El was discontinued. It is connected to the BMT and the rest of the system via the BMT Astoria Line on the upper level of the Queensboro Plaza station.

<text>Union College is a private liberal arts college in Schenectady, New York, United States. Founded in 1795, it was the first institution of higher learning chartered by the New York State Board of Regents, and second in the state of New York, after Columbia College. In the 19th century, it became known as the &quot;Mother of Fraternities&quot;, as three of the earliest Greek letter societies were established there. Union began enrolling women in 1970, after 175 years as an all-male institution. The college offers a liberal arts curriculum across 21 academic departments, including ABET-accredited engineering degree programs.

==History==
===Founding===
Chartered in 1795, Union was the first non-denominational institution of higher education in the United States, and the second college established in the State of New York.

From 1636 to 1769, only nine institutions of higher education were founded permanently in Colonial America. Most had been founded in association with British religious denominations devoted to the perpetuation of their respective Christian denominations. Union College was to be founded with a broader ecumenical basis.

Only Columbia University, founded in 1754 as King&#x27;s College, had preceded Union in New York. Twenty-five years later impetus for another institution grew. As democratic cultural changes rose and began to become dominant, old ways, in particular the old purposes and structure of higher education, began to be challenged.

Schenectady had been founded and populated by people originating from the Netherlands. With about 4,000 residents, it was the third largest city in the state, after New York City and Albany. The local Dutch Reformed Church began to show an interest in establishing an academy or college under its auspices there. In 1778, it invited the Rev. Dirck Romeyn of New Jersey to visit. Returning home, he authored a plan in 1782 for such an institution and was summoned two years later to come help found it.

The Schenectady Academy was established in 1785 as the city&#x27;s first organized school. It immediately flourished, reaching an enrollment of about 100 within a year. By at least 1792 it offered a full four-year college course, as well as one of elementary and practical subjects taught mainly to girls. Attempts to charter the academy as a college with the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York were initially rejected, 
but in 1794 the school reapplied as &quot;Union College&quot;, a name chosen to reflect the resolution of its founders that the school should be free of any specific religious affiliation. The resulting institution was awarded its charter on February 25, 1795 – still celebrated by the college as &quot;Founders&#x27; Day&quot;.

=== Nineteenth century ===
In 1836, the year of its founding, the Union College Anti-Slavery Society claimed 51 members. It published its Constitution and Preamble, with an address to students—not just those of Union—calling on them to join the abolitionist cause. Phi Beta Kappa address published were often before the Civil War. A number of them were anti-slavery and others were progressive addresses.

Union College was sometimes called Schenectady College in this period.

===Seals, mottos, and nickname===
Union chose the modern language French—France was then the most revolutionary of countries—rather than Latin for its motto. The resulting tone of the entire seal is both historically aware and distinctly modern in outlook.

The head of the Roman goddess Minerva (Greek goddess Athena) appeared in the center of an oval. Surrounding it in French was &quot;Sous les lois de Minerve nous devenons tous frères&quot; (). This was expanded to &quot;et soeurs&quot; () in 2015.

Minerva was originally patroness of the arts and crafts, but had over time evolved to become an icon of the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment. By the late 18th century she had indeed come to represent all of those qualities that might be wished for in a rational, virtuous, prudent, wise, and &quot;scientific&quot; man.

In 2023, the college changed the school&#x27;s nickname from &quot;Dutchmen&quot; and &quot;Dutchwomen&quot; to &quot;Garnet Chargers&quot; as part of a branding update. Garnet has been the school&#x27;s official color for 150 years, and the name &quot;chargers&quot; is a reference to &quot;Schenectady&#x27;s legacy as a leader in electrical technologies.&quot;

===Presidents===

Union College has had nineteen presidents since its founding in 1795. The school has the distinction of having had the longest serving college or university president in the history of the United States, Eliphalet Nott (62 years).

The current president is David R. Harris (2018–present).

===Development of the curriculum===
During the first half of the 19th century, students in American colleges would have encountered a very similar course of study, a curriculum with sturdy foundations in the traditional liberal arts. But by the 1820s all of this began to change.

Although Latin and Greek remained a part of the curriculum, new subjects were adopted that offered a more readily apparent application to the busy commercial life of the new nation. Accordingly, French was gradually introduced into the college curriculum, sometimes as a substitute for Greek or Hebrew.

One approach to modernization was the so-called &quot;parallel course of study&quot; in scientific and &quot;literary&quot; subjects. This offered a scientific curriculum in parallel to the classical curriculum, for those students wishing a more modern treatment of modern languages, mathematics, and science, equal in dignity to the traditional course of study.

Union College commenced a parallel scientific curriculum in 1828. Its civil engineering program, introduced in 1845, was the first of its kind at an American liberal arts college. So successful were Union&#x27;s reform efforts that by 1839 the college had one of the largest faculties in American higher education and an enrollment surpassed only by Yale.

== Campus ==
=== Design ===
After Union College received its charter in 1795 the college began conducting classes on the upper floor, while a grammar school continued to be conducted on the lower. It soon became clear that this space would prove inadequate for the growing college. Construction soon began on a three-story building, possibly influenced by Princeton&#x27;s Nassau Hall, that was occupied in 1804. Two dormitories were constructed nearby.

Eliphalet Nott became college president that year, and envisioned an expanding campus to accommodate a growing school. In 1806 a large tract of land was acquired to the east of the Downtown Schenectady, on a slope up from the Mohawk River and facing nearly due west. In 1812 French architect Joseph-Jacques Ramée was then hired to draw up a comprehensive plan for the new campus. Construction of two of the college buildings proceeded quickly enough to permit occupation in 1814. The Union College campus became the first comprehensively planned college campus in the United States.

===Landmarks===
Nott Memorial: Designed by Edward Tuckerman Potter (class of 1853), this building derived from the central rotunda in the original Ramée Plan. While it was probably intended to be a chapel in its original conception, the Nott Memorial&#x27;s primary purpose when finally built was aesthetic. It served as the library until 1961 when Schaffer Library was built. Its design bears some resemblance to the Radcliffe Camera at Oxford University. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986. The building was restored between 1993 and 1995 and today is the centerpiece of the campus.

North and South College: The first college buildings using Ramée&#x27;s plans, the pair were started in 1812 and occupied in 1814. Serving as dormitories, both buildings included faculty residences at each end until well into the 20th century.

Memorial Chapel: Memorial Chapel was constructed between 1924 and 1925 to serve as the central college chapel and to honor Union graduates who lost their lives serving during wartime. The names of Union alumni who died in World War I and World War II appear on its south wall, flanked by portraits of college presidents.

Schaffer Library: Schaffer Library, erected in 1961, was the first building constructed at Union for the sole purpose of housing the college library. Trustee Henry Schaffer donated the majority of funds needed for its construction as well as for a later expansion between 1973 and 1974. The original building was designed by Walker O. Cain of McKim, Mead and White and built by the Hamilton Construction Company. Additional interior work supported by the Schaffer Foundation was done in the 1980s. After structural problems with the 1973–1974 addition developed, a major project to renovate and expand the library was undertaken in the late 1990s. Designed by the firm of Perry, Dean, Rogers, and Partners, the renovation provided space for College Media Services, Writing Center, and a language lab.

Jackson&#x27;s Garden: Begun in the 1830s by Professor Isaac Jackson of the Mathematics Department, Jackson&#x27;s Garden comprises of formal gardens and woodlands. Sited where Ramee&#x27;s original plans called for a garden, it initially featured a mix of vegetables, shrubs, and flowers – some of which were grown from seeds sent by botanists and botanical enthusiasts from around the world. As early as 1844 it drew the admiration of visitors such as John James Audubon, and evolved into a sweeping retreat for both students and faculty.

==Organization and administration==
=== Board of trustees ===
&quot;The Trustees of Union College&quot;, a corporate body, has owned the college and been the college&#x27;s designated legal representative throughout its history. The Board consists of alumni, faculty, students, the president of the college, and others. The governor of the state of New York is also an &quot;ex officio&quot; member. The Board appoints the president of the college upon vacancy of the position.

=== The Student Forum ===
The Student Forum represents the principal form of student government at Union College. The purpose of the Student Forum is to formulate policies in areas involving the student body. The student body is represented by a president, vice-president of administration, vice-president of finance, vice-president of academics, vice-president of campus life, and vice-president for multicultural affairs. The entire Student Forum includes these officers together with two student trustees and 12 class representatives.

=== Memberships and affiliations ===
Union College belongs to the Liberty League, ECAC Hockey, the Annapolis Group, the Oberlin Group, the Consortium of Liberal Arts Colleges (CLAC), and the New York Six Consortium. Union is also a component of Union University, which also includes Albany Medical College, Albany Law School, the Dudley Observatory, and the Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.

=== Student media ===
The Union College radio station, WRUC 89.7, dates from a student project in the fall of 1910, but did not become &quot;live&quot; until 1912. The Union College radio station was among the first wireless transmitters in the country to broadcast regularly scheduled programs. The weekly &quot;Concordiensis&quot;, the principal newspaper of Union College since 1877, is the thirteenth oldest student newspaper in the United States and the oldest continuously published newspaper in Schenectady.

==Academics==
Most undergraduates are required to complete a minimum of 36 term courses in all programs except engineering, which may require up to 40 courses (in two-degree programs, nine courses beyond the requirements for the professional degrees), and students in the Leadership in Medicine program, which requires around 45–50 courses. The most popular majors, by number out of 488 graduates in 2022, were:
*Economics (82)
*Biological and Biomedical Sciences (46)
*Mechanical Engineering (40)
*Political Science and Government (40)
*Research and Experimental Psychology (36)
*Neuroscience (31)

===Admissions===
For the Class of 2027 (enrolling fall 2023), Union College received 9,484 applications and accepted 4,175 (44%). The middle 50% range of SAT scores of enrolled freshmen was 1300-1470 for math + reading, while the middle 50% range of the ACT composite score was 30-33. The average high school grade point average (GPA) was 3.40.

===Undergraduate research===
Undergraduate research at Union College had its origin in the first third of the 20th century when chemistry professor Charles Hurd began involving students in his colloid chemistry investigations. Since then, undergraduate research has taken hold in all disciplines at the college, making this endeavor what has been termed &quot;the linchpin&quot; of the Union education. By the mid-1960s several disciplines at Union had established a senior research thesis requirement, and in 1978 the college began funding faculty-mentored student research in all disciplines. This was followed by the creation of funded summer research opportunities, again in all disciplines at the college, in 1986.

===Study abroad programs===
Union College makes available a variety of opportunities for formal study outside the United States, the most popular of which are the Terms Abroad Programs. Currently, Terms Abroad are offered for residence and study on nearly every continent, some in cooperation with Hobart and William Smith Colleges. In the 2009–2010 school year, programs were offered in 22 countries or regions around the world.

Every year Union College also offers a variety of mini-terms (three-week programs during the winter break or at the beginning of the summer vacation). In the 2009–2010 school year, mini-terms were offered in 11 regions or countries (including the United States).

===Schaffer Library===
Opened in 1961, Schaffer Library currently makes available onsite about 750,000 books in print as well as electronic formats. The two largest historical, electronic collections are &quot;Early English Books Online&quot; (EEBO) and &quot;Eighteenth Century Collections Online&quot; (ECCO). The library&#x27;s print and rare book collections are especially strong in 18th and 19th-century literature, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment. Of particular note is the almost complete preservation of the college&#x27;s first library, acquired between 1795 and 1799.

Union College belongs to several regional and national consortia that improve access to materials not owned by the college.

==Student life==
===Fraternity and sorority life===

The modern fraternity system at American colleges and universities is generally determined as beginning at Union College with the founding of Kappa Alpha Society (1825), Sigma Phi (1827), and Delta Phi (1827). Three other surviving national fraternities – Psi Upsilon (1833), Chi Psi (1841), and Theta Delta Chi (1847) – were founded at Union in the next two decades. On account of this fact, Union has been called &quot;The Mother of Fraternities&quot;.

In the fall of 2021, 33% of the college&#x27;s female students belonged to a sorority and 24% of its male students belonged to a fraternity. In 2010, some 50% of Union&#x27;s sophomores, juniors, and seniors were members of its twelve Greek-letter organizations.

The six current fraternities at Union are members of the North American Interfraternity Conference, and as such come under the supervision of the Interfraternity Council (IFC). They are: Alpha Delta Phi, Chi Psi, Kappa Alpha Society, Sigma Chi, Sigma Phi, and Theta Delta Chi. A chapter of the co-ed community service oriented fraternity Alpha Phi Omega also exists on campus. Among dormant fraternities with active alumni, Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity maintained a chapter on campus from 1888 to 1997. The College Panhellenic Council (CPC) is the governing body for member sororities, of which the National Panhellenic Council (NPC) is the parent organization. There are three CPC sororities at Union: Delta Phi Epsilon, Gamma Phi Beta and Sigma Delta Tau. The Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) is the governing body for organizations under the supervision of the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC), National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO), or for any local organizations that fall under the category. These organizations are Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Iota Phi Theta, Lambda Pi Chi, and Omega Phi Beta. 

=== Minerva system ===
After issues with binge-drinking, and excessive vandalism, Union College&#x27;s board suspended greek life in 2004. This ban removed exclusive rights from sororities and fraternities to any residence on campus, allowing Union College to regain partial ownership of the houses. While not affecting the majority of Greek students, who already shared housing with other students, it displaced the members of five of the most visible fraternities, who enjoyed what the college considered prime real estate in mansions at the heart of the campus. The move was cast as a means of enhancing Union’s social and cultural life, which college officials reported to be overwhelmingly Greek. This initiative was, and remains, a controversial step by the college. A non-residential &quot;house system&quot; was created and funded, establishing buildings to serve as intellectual, social, and cultural centers for resident and non-resident members. All incoming students are randomly assigned to one of the seven Minerva Houses. An Office of Minerva Programs was created to coordinate and supervise Minerva activities.

==Arts and culture==
===Mandeville Gallery===
The Mandeville Gallery presents an annual Art Installation Series in partnership with the Schaffer Library. The Art Installation Series features contemporary artists who visit campus and create a site-specific installation piece for the library&#x27;s Learning Commons.

The Wikoff Student Gallery, on the third floor of the Nott Memorial, is dedicated to showing work by current, full-time Union College students.

The college owns over 3,000 works of art and artifacts which comprise its Permanent Collection, most of which are available for use by faculty and students in support of teaching and research.

===Yulman Theater===
The Department of Music sponsors lectures, performances, recitals, and workshops by visiting artists at numerous campus venues, including the Taylor Music Center and Memorial Chapel. Union College jazz, choral and orchestral groups, a taiko ensemble, and three student a cappella groups perform regularly. The college&#x27;s chamber music series performs at the Memorial Chapel.

The Department of Theater and Dance offers several major theatrical productions as well as staged readings, student performances, guest appearances, and other shows throughout the school year.

==Athletics==

Intercollegiate competition is offered in 26 sports; for men, in baseball, basketball, crew, cross-country, football, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, tennis, and indoor and outdoor track; and for women, in basketball, crew, cross-country, field hockey, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, indoor and outdoor track, and volleyball. Originally a founding member of the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), Union today participates in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the Liberty League, ECAC Hockey and the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey compete at the NCAA Division I level; all other sports compete at the NCAA Division III level.

All club sports are administered through the student activities office. The most active and popular clubs are baseball, bowling, fencing, golf, ice hockey, karate, rugby, skiing, volleyball, and ultimate frisbee. An extensive intramural program is offered in a wide range of sports along with noncredit physical education classes as part of the wellness program.

Facilities include the Frank L. Messa Rink at the Achilles Center, the David Breazzano Fitness Center, the Travis J. Clark Strength Training Facility, the David A. Viniar Athletic Center, and Frank Bailey Field.

Union has hosted the two longest games in NCAA Men&#x27;s Hockey History, losing both by identical 3-2 scores: The longest game in NCAA hockey history was played on March 12, 2010. Quinnipiac University defeated Union College, 3–2, in the ECAC Hockey League Quarter-Finals after 90:22 of overtime. Greg Holt scored the winning goal just after 1:00 am local time. The second-longest game in NCAA hockey history was played on March 5, 2006. Yale University defeated Union College, 3–2, in the ECAC Hockey League first-round playoff game after 81:35 of overtime. David Meckler scored the winning goal with Yale shorthanded.

The Union football team went undefeated during the 1989 regular season, going 10–0. They lost to Dayton in the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl for the NCAA Division III Football Championship, 17–7.

<text>Taconite () is a variety of banded iron formation, an iron-bearing (over 15% iron) sedimentary rock, in which the iron minerals are interlayered with quartz, chert, or carbonate. The name &quot;taconyte&quot; was coined by Horace Vaughn Winchell (1865–1923) – son of Newton Horace Winchell, the Minnesota state geologist – during their pioneering investigations of the Precambrian Biwabik Iron Formation of northeastern Minnesota. He believed the sedimentary rock sequence hosting the iron-formation was correlative with the Taconic orogeny of New England, and referred to the unfamiliar and as-yet-unnamed iron-bearing rock as the &#x27;taconic rock&#x27; or &quot;taconyte&quot;.

Following development of high grade direct shipping iron ore deposits on the Mesabi Range, containing up to 65% iron and as little as 1.25% silica, miners termed the unaltered iron-formation wall rock taconite. The iron content of taconite is generally 30% to 35%, and the silica content generally around 45%. Iron in taconite is commonly present as magnetite, iron silicates, and iron-bearing carbonates, and locally martite (hematite) formed by oxidation of magnetite. Horizons containing magnetite as the dominant mineral have been extensively mined since 1955 to produce iron ore pellets; the term &#x27;taconite&#x27; has consequently been colloquially adapted to describe the magnetite iron-formation ores (&quot;taconite iron ore&quot;), the mining, milling, magnetic separation, and agglomerating process (&quot;taconite process&quot;), and the product iron ore pellets (&quot;taconite pellets&quot;).

==History==
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the United States was mining such an abundance of iron ore of high quality that taconite was considered an uneconomic waste product. By the end of World War II much of the high-grade iron ore in the United States had been exhausted, so taconite became valued as a new source of the metal. 

==Production==
To process taconite, the ore is ground into a fine powder, the magnetite is separated from the gangue by strong magnets, and the powdered iron concentrate is combined with a binder such as bentonite clay and limestone as a flux. As a last step, it is rolled into pellets about 10 millimeters in diameter that contain about 65% iron. The pellets are fired at a very high temperature to harden them and make them durable. This is to ensure that the blast furnace charge remains porous enough to allow heated gas to pass through and react with the pelletized ore. Firing the pellet oxidizes the magnetite (Fe3O4) to hematite (Fe2O3), an exothermic reaction that reduces the cost of pelletizing the concentrate. E. W. Davis of the University of Minnesota Mines Experiment Station is credited with developing the pelletizing process. Since the commercial development of this process in the Lake Superior region in the 1950s, the term &quot;taconite&quot; has been used globally to refer to iron ores amenable to upgrading by similar processes.

Major producers of iron ore pellets from taconite in North America include Iron Ore Company of Canada, Cliffs Natural Resources, Inc., U.S. Steel, and ArcelorMittal. These processed taconite-ore pellets are also referred to as &quot;taconite&quot;. Because this is the form that is typically transported by rail and ship, and cargo of these is often discussed, this usage of the term is very common.
The Mesabi Iron Range region of the American state of Minnesota is a major production area. The taconite iron ore pellets are hauled by railroad to the ports of Silver Bay, Two Harbors and the Twin Ports of Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin, all on Lake Superior. The docks at Escanaba, Michigan, on Lake Michigan, also ship taconite from the Marquette iron range in Michigan, and occasionally ore from Minnesota is hauled by rail there. Marquette, Michigan, also has a taconite dock that loads bulk freighters with ore from the Marquette iron range. The ore is generally shipped by lake freighters to locations on the lower Great Lakes. Many steelmaking centers are near Lake Erie. Due to increased international demand, taconite is shipped to Mexico and China.

The SS &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald,&quot; which sank in Lake Superior on November 10, 1975, was carrying about 26,116 long tons of taconite pellets.

==Taconite and human health==
Beginning in 1955, Reserve Mining Company discharged crushed waste rock (tailings) from their Silver Bay, Minnesota processing plant into Lake Superior. The tailings contained 40% of the amphibole group mineral series cummingtonite-grunerite, which may form asbestiform particles. A small fraction of the fine-grained tailings were shown to widely disperse along the western shore of Lake Superior, the source of drinking water for a number of cities; for example, tests of Duluth, Minnesota&#x27;s water supply showed 100 billion fibers per liter of water. There was no epidemiological proof whether these particles caused cancer or were safe. On April 20, 1974, the U.S. District Court judge Miles Lord ruled that the drinking water and Lake Superior must be protected from the asbestos-like particles. The Reserve Mine was forced to begin disposing of tailing wastes on the land, and to implement air pollution control equipment, instead of discharging them directly to Lake Superior. This became one of the costliest pollution prevention cases in U.S. history. Government-funded studies have found no adverse health effects from drinking Lake Superior water.

A 2003 study of taconite miners concluded that the most likely cause of 14 of the 17 cases of mesothelioma among miners on the iron range was contact with asbestos. Since that study was concluded, 35 more Iron Range miners have been diagnosed with the disease. Mesothelioma occurs at twice the expected rate among the population of the northeastern region of Minnesota, including the Iron Range. Spurred by the 2003 study, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) studied the relationship of fibrous minerals in taconite and taconite dust, and lung conditions similar to asbestosis, pleural mesothelioma and other pleural conditions which occur following asbestos exposure. Because these conditions can be triggered by industrial asbestos, which was used in taconite mining and processing, as well as other industrial facilities in northeastern Minnesota, the study attempted to determine what, if any, influence naturally occurring fibrous minerals in taconite may have played. The lengthy epidemiological study of Minnesota iron miners concluded in December 2014 that those working 30 years in the iron mines and living to be 80 years old had a lifetime chance of having a mesothelioma of 3.33 cases per thousand such workers, more than double the background rate of 1.44 cases per thousand people living to 80 years old.

<text>Sam Patch (1799 – November 13, 1829; some sources believed his birth year to be 1807) was known as &quot;The Jersey Jumper&quot;, &quot;The Daring Yankee&quot;, or the &quot;Yankee Leaper&quot; became the first famous American daredevil after successfully jumping from a raised platform into the Niagara River near the base of Niagara Falls in 1829.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Sam Patch was born to Mayo Greenleaf Patch and Abigail McIntire and was the fifth child of the family that included Molly, Greenleaf, Nabby, Samuel (died as an infant), Samuel, and Issac.

Sam was raised in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, where he began working as a child laborer spinning cotton in a mill. When he was not working, he entertained other boys by jumping off the mill dam. By his early 20s, he was working at a mill in Paterson, New Jersey, and was jumping off ever-higher spots. He was beginning to attract crowds for his well-advertised stunts. On September 30, 1827, he jumped off the Passaic Falls (The Great Falls of Paterson) in New Jersey, pleasing a large crowd that had gathered. He repeated this jump at least two more times. On August 11, 1828, Patch jumped 100 feet at Hoboken, New Jersey. He became known in the press as &quot;Patch the Jersey Jumper.&quot; Patch continued his career jumping from bridges, factory walls, and ships&#x27; masts.

===Niagara Falls===

In the fall of 1829, Patch gained fame by leaping into the Niagara River near the base of Niagara Falls. Patch was the star attraction at an event designed to draw visitors to the falls. A 125-foot ladder was extended over the river below Goat Island, opposite the Cave of the Winds. Less than an hour before the scheduled noon jump, a chain securing the ladder to the cliff wall snapped, breaking 15 feet from the ladder. Rescheduled for 4 PM, Patch jumped on time, from a height of more than 80 feet. A boat circled near the entry point, but Patch did not appear. When he was finally spotted on the shore, a great roar went up from the crowd.

Bad weather and the delay in his arrival drew a disappointingly small crowd for this jump, so Patch announced he would repeat the feat a second time from the greater height of 120 feet on October 17. A few days later, 10,000 gathered to watch him keep his word.

Following his feat at Niagara falls, Sam Patch achieved nationwide fame. His name became a household word and his slogan &quot;some things can be done as well as others&quot; became a popular expression across the nation.

===Rochester===
Shortly after, Patch went to Rochester, New York, to challenge the High Falls of the Genesee River. On Friday, November 6, 1829, in front of an estimated 7,000 to 8,000 spectators, Patch went out onto a rock ledge in the middle of the falls. He first threw a pet bear cub over the falls and the cub managed to swim safely to shore. Patch then successfully jumped after the bear.

==Last jump==

His first jump into the Genesee River raised a disappointing amount of money, so he decided to repeat the stunt one week later on November 13, 1829, (Friday the 13th). This time, he increased the height of the jump to by constructing a stand. Accounts from the 8,000 present differ on whether he actually jumped or fell, but he did not achieve his normal feet-first vertical entry. A loud impact was heard and he never surfaced. Rumors were passed that he had hidden in a cave at the base of the falls, and was enjoying all the excitement he had created. But his frozen body was found in the ice in Charlotte (Rochester) early the next spring by Silas Hudson. An autopsy revealed that the sudden change in the temperature of the atmosphere as he descended down the fall had caused his blood vessels to rupture. Local ministers and newspapers were quick to blame the crowd for urging him to jump, and put the guilt of his death on them.

He was buried in Charlotte Cemetery, near where his body was found. A wooden board (now gone) was placed over his grave. It read: &quot;Here lies Sam Patch – Such is Fame&quot;.

==Legacy==

Sam Patch&#x27;s legacy continued to build in the years following his death. He became a popular folk hero in both written poems and stories as well as the hero of a series of theatrical plays by actor Dan Marble entitled &quot;Sam Patch the Yankee Jumper&quot;, followed by &quot;Sam Patch at Home&quot;, a London Tour of &quot;Sam Patch in France&quot;, and &quot;Sam Patch the Jumper&quot; (1844). President Andrew Jackson named his horse Sam Patch in Patch&#x27;s honor.

His legacy continues into the 21st century with media references including:
*The band Piñataland chronicled Patch&#x27;s 1827 jump on a song titled &quot;The Fall of Sam Patch&quot; on their 2008 album &quot;Songs for the Forgotten Future Vol. 2&quot;.
*The IFC comedy sketch show &quot;The Birthday Boys&quot; referenced the story of Sam Patch as a running gag/call back during the 4th episode of their second season entitled &quot;Freshys&quot;.
*The podcast &quot;The Memory Palace&quot; featured the story of Sam Patch in the episode &quot;Plummeting Approval&quot;.
*&quot;Drunk History&quot; featured Sam Patch&#x27;s story in the Season 4, Episode 2 episode, &quot;Legends&quot;, played by actor and comedian Kyle Mooney.
*Canadian musician Tim Kingsbury adopted the name Sam Patch for a musical project.
*&quot;Sam Patch&quot; is the name given to a replica Erie Canal packet boat that provides tours of the Rochester area waterways.

===Literary references===

&quot;Sam Patch&#x27;s Fearsome Leap,&quot; a tale in &quot;Grandfather Stories&quot; by Samuel Hopkins Adams, is a reconstructed first-hand account of the day of Patch&#x27;s last leap. It is not clear whether Adams based the tale on a real first-hand account or wrote it as historical fiction.

Patch appears as a &quot;daring moral hero&quot; in the works of Hawthorne and Melville, and also appears in the poem &quot;Paterson&quot; by William Carlos Williams.

The adventures of Patch and his bear, as narrated by the bear himself, comprise the picaresque novel by William Getz, &quot;Sam Patch: Ballad of a Jumping Man&quot; (New York: Franklin Watts, 1986).

<text>Floyd Elgin Dominy (December 24, 1909 Adams County, Nebraska – April 20, 2010 Boyce, Virginia) was appointed commissioner of the United States Bureau of Reclamation from May 1, 1959, to December 1, 1969, by Dwight D. Eisenhower. Dominy joined the Bureau in 1946. He was the assistant commissioner from 1957 to 1958. He was responsible for building Glen Canyon Dam and the creation of Lake Powell behind it. He died in Boyce, Virginia, where he had lived since at least 1990.

Dominy&#x27;s father and grandfather were homesteaders, and his upbringing was marked by humble circumstances. He graduated from the University of Wyoming in 1933 with a degree in agricultural economics. Not long after graduation, he became a county agricultural extension agent in Campbell County, Wyoming, where his enthusiasm for dams endeared him to local farmers and ranchers.

Dominy was a strong advocate for use of the Colorado River and other water resources of the west for agriculture and development, in opposition to the growing environmental movement. He was the director of several projects like the Colorado River Storage Project, Colorado River Basin Project, Missouri River Basin Project, Columbia River Basin Project, California Central Valley Project, and the Mekong River Basin Project in Thailand. 

Dominy was a main character in two non-fiction books about water management the American west: &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot; by Marc Reisner and &quot;Encounters with the Archdruid&quot; by John McPhee. McPhee arranged a whitewater rafting trip down the Colorado River with Dominy and David Brower, a prominent environmentalist and founder of Friends of the Earth, and the book highlights their opposing views of the river and its uses.

<text>Kevin Graham Ogilvie (born December 5, 1962), known professionally as Nivek Ogre, is a Canadian musician, performance artist and actor, best known for his work with the industrial music group Skinny Puppy, which he co-founded with cEvin Key. Since 1982, he has served as Skinny Puppy&#x27;s primary lyricist and vocalist, occasionally providing instrumentation and samples. Ogre&#x27;s charismatic personality, guttural vocals and use of costumes, props, and fake blood on stage helped widen Skinny Puppy&#x27;s fanbase and has inspired numerous other musicians.

In 2001, he formed the electronic music group ohGr along with longtime collaborator Mark Walk. Originally named W.E.L.T., ohGr has released five studio albums since 2001, three of which have placed on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Dance/Electronic Albums chart. Ogre has also been involved with several other musicians including the Al Jourgensen bands Ministry and Revolting Cocks, Pigface and Rx with Martin Atkins, and KMFDM.

Ogre has on several occasions worked as an actor in low-budget horror films. He appeared as Pavi Largo in the rock opera film &quot;Repo! The Genetic Opera&quot;, as well as Harper Alexander in the comedy-horror film entitled &quot;2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams&quot;. Ogre was reunited with &quot;Repo!&quot; director Darren Lynn Bousman for the 2012 musical short film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Carnival&quot; and its sequel &quot;Alleluia! The Devil&#x27;s Carnival&quot;. In 2014, he starred in the Canadian film &quot;Queen of Blood&quot;.

==Early life==
Ogre was born on December 5, 1962, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. From a young age, he had imagined working in a studio as a singer, believing it was his own &quot;manifest destiny&quot;. He was also interested in magic and had attempted to become a magician, joining the International Brotherhood of Magicians. He entertained his parents with magic shows, during which his tricks would often fail humorously. He described his childhood as &quot;introverted&quot;, and that he would take refuge in watching monster movies; he also enjoyed the horror fantasy writings of H. P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe.

As a child, he was fascinated with words and would spend time in his basement writing poetry. He would write several pages at a time and then play around with what he had written. &quot;From that, I developed a keen sense of how words sound, how they can phonetically sound and be changed. How words obviously have different meanings and with a slight displacement can take on almost a surreal meaning&quot;. This interest in language and vocabulary stemmed from his love of music and lyrics. His subsequent musical stylings were informed by the likes of Brian Eno, Syd Barrett, and Kraftwerk. He has cited the Cure&#x27;s &quot;Pornography&quot;, David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)&quot;, and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark&#x27;s &quot;Organisation&quot; as pivotal records during his youth. Ogre said that Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; introduced him to &quot;the dark side of music&quot;; he soon found himself gravitating towards musicians such as Throbbing Gristle, Portion Control, and Front 242.

Ogre left Calgary for Vancouver, British Columbia at the age of twenty. &quot;Vancouver has an edge to it; an attitude; an arrogance when it comes to music. I came there as a young 20-year-old from Calgary and entered into a world I’d never seen before&quot;. In 1982, he attempted to start a record distribution company using borrowed money, a venture that ultimately failed. He was further troubled by the death of his father and a divorce from his wife. Ogre was roommates with Images in Vogue member Gary Blair Smith when he met cEvin Key (Kevin Crompton), the drummer for Smith&#x27;s band, at a party. He also met future collaborator Steven Gilmore, whom he learned had also attended Ernest Manning High School in Calgary. Key asked Ogre to join his project, Skinny Puppy, an invitation he accepted. Images in Vogue recording engineer Dave Ogilvie also signed up. The pair adopted stage names to avoid the confusion brought by having two people named Kevin in one group. (cEvin Key and Nivek (Kevin spelled backwards) Ogre)

==Music career==
===Skinny Puppy===
Ogre&#x27;s work with Skinny Puppy has primarily been as the lead singer, though he would occasionally contribute work with percussion and synthesizers. The first song he wrote for the group was titled &quot;Canine&quot; and helped establish the philosophy of writing songs about the world as seen through a dog&#x27;s eyes. &quot;It was about a dog watching his master beat his wife and then questioning himself - should he be loyal to the man or rip his head off?&quot; Along with Bill Leeb (Wilhelm Shroeder), Ogre and Key produced the EP &quot;Remission&quot; in 1984 and released it through the newly established Nettwerk label. Next to follow were two full-length albums, &quot;Bites&quot; in 1985 and &quot;&quot; in 1986, the latter of which spawned their first single, &quot;Dig It&quot;.

Many of Ogre&#x27;s early songs, specifically from the album &quot;Bites&quot;, were about his ex-wife. Following &quot;Bites&quot;, Ogre began to construct more politically and socially minded lyrics such as those for the song &quot;Dig It&quot;, which he says describes &quot;a fight to rise above in the work force/ which can turn into your early grave&quot;. Ogre&#x27;s writing would gradually become more &quot;worldly&quot; and &quot;ecology-minded&quot;. Animal rights and environmental degradation would become recurring elements in Skinny Puppy&#x27;s music. 1988&#x27;s &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot;, written as &quot;a biting commentary on animal rights&quot;, spawned the single &quot;Testure&quot; which peaked at no. 19 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Dance Club Songs chart.

Skinny Puppy became known for their performance art laden live shows, a result of Ogre&#x27;s use of costumes, props, and fake blood. The set design for a live show often falls to Ogre, who usually builds the sets himself. Ogre described the &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; tour as his career high point, during which he ran off what he called &quot;car-crash energy&quot;.

While recording the Skinny Puppy album &quot;The Process&quot; in Los Angeles, a split began to grow between the band members with Ogre on one side and the other two band members, Key and keyboardist Dwayne Goettel, on the other. In 1994, Skinny Puppy completed the master tapes for the album. Key and Goettel returned to Vancouver with the tapes while Ogre decided to stay in Los Angeles. Ogre quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995, two months before Goettel died from a heroin overdose.

He joined the Banff Centre as an artist-in-residence in spring 2000 before reuniting with Key to perform at the Doomsday Festival in Dresden as Skinny Puppy. Relations improved between the two band members after the performance and they released &quot;The Greater Wrong of the Right&quot; in 2004; they followed this up with the release of &quot;Mythmaker&quot; in 2007 and &quot;hanDover&quot; in 2011. In 2013, inspired by the news that their music had been used for torture at Guantanamo Bay detention camp, they released the album &quot;Weapon&quot;. In early 2014, Ogre and Key sent the US government an invoice for $666,000 for the use of their music at the camp. Ogre told the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; that &quot;they didn’t even use our actual recordings – they used bootlegs, so there was all sorts of hiss and distortion in the mix, which was probably even more disturbing to the person who was having it done to them&quot;. In 2015, they embarked on the &quot;Down the Sociopath&quot; tour with Youth Code through North America. A follow-up tour in Europe entitled &quot;Down the Sociopath too Euro 2017&quot; began in May 2017.

===ohGr===
In 1989, Ogre and Al Jourgensen started the side project W.E.L.T. (When Everyone Learns the Truth). Some material was recorded, but the only song they released was turned into Ministry&#x27;s 1996 song &quot;The Fall&quot;, from &quot;Filth Pig&quot;. During the recording of &quot;The Process&quot; in Malibu, Ogre befriended Ruby member Mark Walk. They revived the W.E.L.T. project by producing a 14-track album, but this was eventually shelved by their label, American Recordings. Ogre became depressed as a result of the labels decision; he told &quot;Exclaim!&quot; in 1998 that to relieve the situation, he picked up a book on Pink Floyd and started playing the guitar. &quot;That was really good for me, it was really good therapy. It took hours and hours of time that would have been spent fixating on a problem that there was really nothing I could do about&quot;.

Ogre was kept on the label for three years, unable to do anything with the recordings. &quot;It wasn’t until about 2000 that I pulled myself up by the bootstraps and went to see what was going on. I found out that all that time, I could have just walked away from it because no one was going to do anything&quot;. Ogre and Walk landed a deal with Spitfire Records, but were unable to retrieve their original master recordings from American. This meant they had to rerecord the entire album, a feat which took them roughly three to four months. Using the new moniker ohGr, the album was released as &quot;Welt&quot; in February 2001. A video for the song &quot;Cracker&quot; was produced by Skinny Puppy collaborator William Morrison, who would join the group on tour. Also joining the tour was cEvin Key, who performed drums.

ohGr would produce three more albums including &quot;SunnyPsyOp&quot; in 2003, &quot;Devils in my Details&quot; in 2008, &quot;UnDeveloped&quot; in 2011, all of which landed on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Dance/Electronic Albums chart. &quot;What makes ohGr different from Skinny Puppy&quot;, Ogre explained to &quot;Westword&quot; in 2011, &quot;is that Skinny Puppy focuses on sound design with lyrics laid on top, while ohGr bases its music around lyrics&quot;. He stated further: &quot;When we&#x27;re performing live, with ohGr, we strip back a lot of the electronics and the stuff that doesn&#x27;t need to be there...All the guitars out, all the bass out, when it&#x27;s played live, and a lot of the keyboards are played live, too&quot;.

ohGr released their fifth album, &quot;Tricks&quot;, on June 18, 2018. The album was funded by a PledgeMusic campaign. The album had been intended for release on October 31, 2017, but the release date was pushed back due to a mastering error. The band promoted the album with a 32 date North American tour and included three dates for the 2018 Cold Waves festival, which they had performed in the year prior while supporting KMFDM. The tour was the first time in 25 years Ogre performed in his hometown of Calgary. The band was supported by Paul Barker&#x27;s Lead into Gold and Omniflux.

In January 2019, amid similar stories from other bands, Walk told &quot;Billboard&quot; that PledgeMusic had owed the band $100,000 in funds raised during the campaign. The company had been unresponsive with regards to when the band would be paid, which had forced them to release the album digitally and tour without merchandise to sell.

===Collaborations with Al Jourgensen===
Ogre&#x27;s first collaboration with Al Jourgensen was in 1987 during the recording of the song &quot;Show Me Your Spine&quot; for the film &quot;RoboCop&quot;. The song was recorded by PTP, a side project of Jourgensen&#x27;s alongside Ministry cohort Paul Barker. Jourgensen explained that he &quot;didn&#x27;t even know who he [Ogre] was, but somebody said he was some singer from somewhere, so I just said &quot;hey man, make yourself useful, get in here and sing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;prongs/al/ogre&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ogre would later go on tour with Ministry to promote their album &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot; in 1988. Ogre asked Jourgensen if he would produce the 1989 Skinny Puppy album &quot;Rabies&quot;, a job he accepted. Jourgensen described his experience with Skinny Puppy as tumultuous since it had been Ogre, not Key and Goettel, who asked for assistance on the record; &quot;Sometimes bad vibes make for great, tension-filled music, and that&#x27;s what Skinny Puppy thrived on&quot;.

Ogre next worked with Jourgensen on the Ministry album &quot;The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot;, receiving credit as a writer on the song &quot;Thieves&quot;. Ogre introduced Jourgensen to Toronto native Angelina Lukacin whose voice was recorded for the album closer &quot;Dream Song&quot;. Ogre joined Ministry on tour contributing guitars, keyboards, and vocals. He said that &quot;Playing with Ministry was insane everywhere, especially during the tour for &quot;The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot;, which had the cage set up at the front of the stage. It became all you saw, the cage separating you from the raging mass of people in front of you&quot;. The single &quot;Burning Inside&quot; featured a live cover of the Skinny Puppy song &quot;Smothered Hope&quot;, with Ogre contributing vocals.

Ogre had also worked with Jourgensen in the industrial group Revolting Cocks, originally as a touring member. Ogre mentioned that he &quot;had a gas&quot; while on tour, referring to it as an initiation; &quot;My brain was rotating about four feet above my head&quot;. He continued to work with the group by providing vocals for their 1990 effort &quot;Beers, Steers, and Queers&quot;. When Ogre was again invited to tour with the band, he declined, explaining that his friendship with Jourgensen had become strained. &quot;There were a few things that happened between me and him [Jourgensen] that really made me question our whole friendship and his reason for having me down there. So I decided to bow out of the Revolting Cocks tour. If I hadn&#x27;t, I would have come back totally addicted to heroin&quot;.

===Other musical ventures===
Ogre became involved with Pigface, an industrial music collective formed by Martin Atkins, on their 1990 debut &quot;Gub&quot;. He sang on the song &quot;Tapeworm&quot; and was featured on the 1991 live album &quot;Welcome to Mexico... Asshole&quot;. Ogre also contributed to the studio albums &quot;Fook&quot; (1992) and &quot;Notes from Thee Underground&quot; (1994), and the live album &quot;Truth Will Out&quot; (1993) as a guitarist. Ogre again teamed up with Atkins to form the band Ritalin, later renamed Rx. The duo&#x27;s only release, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Bedside Toxicology&quot;, provided a showcase for Ogre&#x27;s singing, something which he had worked on while spending time in Seattle. Ogre also made several contributions to KMFDM, providing vocals for the song &quot;Torture&quot; on their 1997 album &quot;Symbols&quot;. He joined the band as a guest musician for their &quot;Symbols&quot; tour. He said of his experience: &quot;There was a really great vibe on that tour and I really got along with all the people and it gave me a chance to laugh maniacally&quot;. He worked with KMFDM again in 1999, singing on the songs &quot;That&#x27;s All&quot; and &quot;Full Worm Garden&quot; for the album &quot;Adios&quot;.

Ogre appeared on The Final Cut&#x27;s 1991 debut album, &quot;Consumed&quot;, alongside Chris Connelly, and provided Monster Voodoo Machine a remix of the song &quot;Copper Theft&quot; on their 1994 album &quot;Defense Mechanism&quot;. Ogre worked with Mark Walk on several tracks for the 1996 video game &quot;Descent II&quot; and later on a remix of &quot;Smothered Hope&quot; for the album &quot;Remix dystemper&quot; in 1998. The pair also provided a remix of the song &quot;Edge of the World&quot; by The Crüxshadows on their release &quot;Shadowbox&quot;. He covered the song &quot;Borderline&quot; by Madonna for the album &quot;Virgin Vocies 2000: A Tribute to Madonna&quot; and appeared on cEvin Key&#x27;s 2001 solo album, &quot;The Ghost of Each Room&quot;. Ogre supplied a remix of the track &quot;Wraith&quot; for John Carpenter&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Lost Themes&quot; and also contributed to the 2015 &quot;Demons&quot; (1985 film) remix album.

==Style==
===Vocals and lyrics===
Described by Bill Henderson of &quot;The Orlando Sentinel&quot; as &quot;disturbing, distorted and disconnected from anything real&quot;, Ogre&#x27;s vocal style took influence from the likes of Stephen Mallinder of Cabaret Voltaire and Ian Sharp of Portion Control, and has in turn influenced a number of subsequent artists. &quot;If I can do it and can emote, then anyone has a chance. And you don’t need to be a vocal acrobat to get an emotion across&quot;. He started off his career as a &quot;non-singer&quot;, with his vocals often heavily treated with effects. His guttural and oftentimes unintelligible delivery became a hallmark of Skinny Puppy&#x27;s music. His lyrics, usually delivered as a stream of consciousness meant to invoke certain images to the listener, range from surrealistic to overtly sociopolitical, and explore topics such as vivisection, war, disease, the environment, addiction, and self-determination. The meaning behind his lyrics is often obscured by the cacophony of music surrounding them. &quot;We&#x27;re more into creating moods, and within them there&#x27;s a lot more freedom for people to make up their minds and apply the lyrics to themselves and different situations&quot;. When asked if he was bothered by people misinterpreting his lyrics, he replied &quot;art is for interpretation, and interpretation can take on whatever form it wants&quot;.

In the mid 90s, fearing that after years of strain he was beginning to lose his voice, he started receiving vocal training and implemented various exercises to save it. For the W.E.L.T. project, producer Mark Walk encouraged Ogre to sing without vocal effects, a prospect which initially terrified Ogre, who said the effects were like a protective shield. To boost his confidence, he spent eight months working with his voice to test its capabilities. He later said that singing without treated vocals allowed him to express himself in ways he&#x27;d never been able to with Skinny Puppy. He continued this method with &quot;Bedside Toxicology&quot;, during the production of which he said he learned that not only could he compose music, but he could also harmonize with his voice. &quot;I have more control over harmonies. In these incremental ways you like grow as an artist, hopefully&quot;.

===Live performances===
Ogre&#x27;s live performances have been referred to as performance art, and are influenced by his interest in the horror films, the work of Alice Cooper, and his childhood love of magic tricks. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; attributed Ogre&#x27;s theatrics to him becoming &quot;the first industrial rock star&quot;. On stage, he employs a wide range of props and costumes, and uses liberal amounts of fake blood despite an allergy to red food dye. He considered the &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; tour to be a career high point and one of his favorites, and included several large set pieces, one of which, the stilt-man, involved Ogre walking on stilts while operating a pair of hydraulic crutches as he lurched towards the audience. When asked if he felt Marilyn Manson had stolen parts of his old stage show for himself, Ogre insisted that Manson had only ever used the stilt-man character, incorporating it into his own show.

Despite his work being labeled shock rock, he says that his performances are meant to get the audience to think and see different viewpoints rather than simply gross them out. He toned down the use of props for his performances with ohGr, wanting the shows to instead focus on music. He clarified his stance while touring in support of &quot;Devils in My Details&quot;: &quot;For me, ohGr is not a way to reinvent the wheel but to be open to anything. So it doesn&#x27;t mean, necessarily, that there&#x27;s going to be a lot of flash on this tour, because that&#x27;s more of a Skinny Puppy trademark&quot;. He told the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; that he had disliked his early work with Skinny Puppy, saying that he thought of himself as a &quot;ham-fisted hack&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t until he revisited old concert footage that he changed his mind. &quot;I recently watched a concert video of me cutting a smile into my face during &#x27;Assimilate&#x27;, and I was creating tension even though I didn&#x27;t know I was doing it. It all came from my love of magic&quot;.

==Acting career==
Ogre&#x27;s first attempt at acting came in the form of an audition for the role of Funboy in &quot;The Crow&quot;, an experience which he described as being dreadful. &quot;That&#x27;s where for the first time I really hit that wall of &#x27;whoa, this is very different than being on stage&#x27;. The read was with [the] male assistant director who was playing the female opposite me in a kind of sexy situation [...] I just lost my shit trying to make this work and thought, &#x27;this isn’t for me&#x27;&quot;. Skinny Puppy were to appear on the soundtrack with the song &quot;Outafter&quot; (which later appeared on the Download album &quot;The Eyes of Stanley Pain&quot;). However, Ogre nixed the idea as he felt the song sounded too &quot;techno-y&quot;; he later regretted this decision when he found out the film&#x27;s star Brandon Lee liked the song.

Ogre&#x27;s first experience acting was alongside his Skinny Puppy cohorts in the film &quot;The Doom Generation&quot;. The film&#x27;s director Gregg Araki, a Skinny Puppy fan, invited the band to play as a group of goons who attack a car. cEvin Key sustained several injuries from falling off the car; &quot;[He] landed right on his face. Literally faceplanted into cement&quot;. Ogre later stated that, &quot;I don&#x27;t think we ever heard back from Gregg Araki after that, unfortunately. He&#x27;s a great director, and it wasn&#x27;t anything weird between us and him; it was just an odd thing that happened&quot;.

Ogre returned to the screen in the 2008 Darren Lynn Bousman film &quot;Repo! The Genetic Opera&quot; as Pavi, a frequent partier who wears a mask of flesh. The film was released in 11 theaters worldwide and received mostly negative reviews from critics. Ogre responded to the criticism, telling Arielle Castillo of the &quot;Miami New Times&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not without problems, it was a low-budget film [...] There are a few things like editing and connecting things, but it still works, it&#x27;s still got a lot of heart&quot;. Ogre later appeared as Harper Alexander in the Tim Sullivan film &quot;2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams&quot;, replacing Giuseppe Andrew who had played the character in the film&#x27;s 2005 predecessor.

Ogre reunited with Bousman for the 2012 horror musical short &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Carnival&quot; and its accompanying road tour as The Twin. He returned for the full-length feature sequel, 2015&#x27;s &quot;Alleluia! The Devil&#x27;s Carnival&quot;. In 2014, he starred in &quot;Scream Park&quot; alongside Doug Bradley. In the film, he plays psychotic killer Iggy, who, alongside his partner Ogre (played by Ian Lemmon), hunt down crew members of a decommissioning amusement park. He also appeared in the 2014 film &quot;Queen of Blood&quot;, the spiritual successor to director Chris Alexander&#x27;s debut film. Ogre was also featured in the 2016 documentary &quot;Diary of a Dead Beat&quot;, which follows the career of filmmaker Jim Van Bebber.

==Personal life==
Ogre is known for being a staunch supporter of animal rights, often condemning animal testing as being &quot;pointless&quot;. He has more specifically explained his grievances with cases such as monkeys faces being crushed in laboratories to test car crash physics models or vivisections performed on dogs. He explained his viewpoint in a 2000 interview with &quot;Zillo&quot; magazine: &quot;No human being would want to endure that kind of torture. Who would want to be locked up in some sterile laboratory? I love animals more than anything.&quot; This stance culminated in the 1988 Skinny Puppy album &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; and its accompanying stage show, which featured re-enactments of animal experiments with a prop dog. These recreations were so provocative that the band was arrested and fined for being a nuisance to the public. In addition, he opposes factory farming and was a vegetarian for fourteen years, but abandoned the diet citing health problems.

In the period between the production of the albums &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; and &quot;Last Rights&quot;, Ogre struggled with substance abuse. His addiction to drugs, coupled with his preference for working with Al Jourgensen, led to him often being the odd one out. Ogre was admitted into hospital while touring with Pigface in Sweden. While there he learned he had contracted hepatitis A, and later went to seek treatment from a rehab center in Edmonton. Reflecting on the turbulent production of 1996&#x27;s &quot;The Process&quot;, Ogre said: &quot;We all had drug problems but didn&#x27;t know it from each other [...] I was in Los Angeles getting clean while the others were doing drugs in Vancouver.&quot; Ogre remains an avid supporter for the legalization of marijuana.

Writer Jolene Siana had sent Ogre numerous letters over a span of three years during the 1980s. Following a chance meeting with Siana a decade later, Ogre returned these letters, which he had stored away in a box. Siana then compiled the letters and published them in the book &quot;Go Ask Ogre: Letters From a Deathrock Cutter&quot; in 2005.

<doc id="461737" wikidata="Q769226" url="?curid=461737" title="List of World War II military aircraft of Germany">
<text>This list covers aircraft of the German Luftwaffe during the Second World War from 1939 to 1945. Numerical designations are largely within the RLM designation system.

The Luftwaffe officially existed from 1933–1945 but training had started in the 1920s, before the Nazi seizure of power, and many aircraft made in the inter-war years were used during World War II. The most significant aircraft that participated in World War II are highlighted in blue. Pre-war aircraft not used after 1938 are excluded, as are projects and aircraft that did not fly.
The listed roles are the primary roles of the aircraft during World War II – many obsolete pre-war combat aircraft remained in use as trainers rather than in their original more familiar roles. Captured or acquired aircraft are listed separately as many were used only for evaluation while those available in large enough numbers were commonly used as trainers, while a small number were usen the Reich Aviation Ministry&#x27;s list of aircraft at list of RLM aircraft designations and a full explanation is at RLM aircraft designation system. A small number of surviving pre-1933 aircraft were overlooked by the RLM system and just used the company names or designations.

==Luftwaffe aircraft==
The primary types operated by the Luftwaffe are shown highlighted, with the most numerous in bold.

<doc id="461741" wikidata="Q1294909" url="?curid=461741" title="Edwin R. Thiele">
<text>Edwin Richard Thiele (10 September 1895 – 15 April 1986) was an American Seventh-day Adventist missionary in China, editor, archaeologist, writer, and scholar of the Old Testament. He is best known for his chronological studies of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel.

== Biography ==
Thiele was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, on September 10, 1895. He graduated from Emmanuel Missionary College, which later became Andrews University in 1960, in 1918 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in ancient languages. After two years of work as home missionary secretary for the East Michigan Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, he left in 1920 for mission service in China. During his 12 years in China, he was an editor and manager for the Signs of the Times Publishing House in Shanghai.

After returning to the United States, Thiele studied archaeology, obtaining a Master of Arts degree from the University of Chicago in 1937. He then joined the religion faculty of Emmanuel Missionary College while continuing his doctoral work at the University of Chicago. He obtained a PhD in biblical archaeology in 1943. His doctoral dissertation, &quot;The Chronology of the Kings of Judah and Israel&quot;, was later expanded and published as &quot;The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings&quot; which became widely regarded as an important work on the chronology of Hebrew kings. He traveled extensively throughout the Middle East in the course of his research.

Later Thiele also authored a popular book on Christianity, &quot;Knowing God&quot;. After his death, his widow Margaret completed his study of the Book of Job entitled &quot;Job and the Devil&quot;.

From 1963 to 1965 he served as Professor of Antiquity at Andrews University. After retiring from teaching in 1965, he moved to California, where he continued to write. He died in St. Helena, California, in 1986. He is buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in Berrien Springs, Michigan.

== Reception of chronological work ==
Thiele&#x27;s chronological reconstruction has not been accepted by all scholars. Nonetheless, the work of Thiele and those who followed in his steps achieved acceptance across a wider spectrum than that of any comparable chronology; as Assyriologist D. J. Wiseman (1993) wrote, &quot;The chronology most widely accepted today is one based on the meticulous study by Thiele.&quot; More recently in 2010, Leslie McFall asserted that &quot;Thiele&#x27;s chronology is fast becoming the consensus view among Old Testament scholars, if it has not already reached that point.&quot;

Although criticism has been leveled at numerous specific points in Thiele&#x27;s chronology, his work has won considerable praise even from those who disagree with his conclusions. On the other hand, even scholars sharing Thiele&#x27;s religious convictions have sometimes maintained that there are weaknesses in his argument such as unfounded assumptions and assumed circular reasoning.

In his desire to resolve the discrepancies between the data in the Book of Kings, Thiele was forced to make improbable suppositions ... There is no basis for Thiele&#x27;s statement that his conjectures are correct because he succeeded in reconciling most of the data in the Book of Kings, since his assumptions ... are derived from the chronological data themselves ...

In response to the &quot;circular reasoning&quot; criticism, Kenneth Strand has pointed out several archaeological finds that were published after Thiele produced his chronology and that verified Thiele&#x27;s assumptions or conclusions as against the chronological systems of other scholars such as Albright that were posited before Thiele&#x27;s work.

Despite the various criticisms Thiele&#x27;s methodological treatment remains the typical starting point of scholarly treatments of the subject, and his work is considered to have established the date of the division of the Israelite kingdom.

<doc id="461754" wikidata="Q491516" url="?curid=461754" title="Chick-fil-A">
<text>Chick-fil-A, Inc. ( , a play on the American English pronunciation of &quot;&quot;) is an American fast food restaurant chain and the largest chain specializing in chicken sandwiches. Headquartered in College Park, Georgia, Chick-fil-A operates 3,164 restaurants across 48 states, as well as in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The company also has operations in Canada, and previously had restaurants in the United Kingdom and South Africa. The restaurant has a breakfast menu and a lunch and dinner menu. The chain also provides catering services. Chick-fil-A calls its specialty the &quot;original chicken sandwich&quot;. It is a piece of deep-fried breaded boneless chicken breast served on a toasted bun with two slices of dill pickle, or with lettuce, tomato, and cheese.

Many of the company&#x27;s values are influenced by the Christian religious beliefs of its late founder, S. Truett Cathy (1921–2014), a devout Southern Baptist. Reflecting a commitment to Sunday Sabbatarianism, all restaurants are closed for business on Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas Day. The company&#x27;s conservative opposition to same-sex marriage has caused controversy; the company began to loosen its stance on this issue from 2019. Despite numerous controversies and boycott attempts, the 2022 American Customer Satisfaction Index found that Chick-fil-A remained the country&#x27;s favorite fast food chain for the eighth consecutive year, and it has the highest per store sales of any fast food chain in the nation.

==History==

The chain&#x27;s origin can be traced to the Dwarf Grill (now the Dwarf House), a restaurant opened by S. Truett Cathy, the chain&#x27;s former chairman and CEO, in Hapeville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta, in 1946, which is near the location of the Ford Motor Company Atlanta Assembly Plant, for many years a source of many of the restaurant&#x27;s patrons. It was later remodeled, reopening in 2022.

In 1961, after 15 years in the fast-food business, Cathy found a pressure fryer that could cook a chicken sandwich at the same time it took to cook a hamburger. Following this discovery, he registered the name Chick-fil-A, Inc. The company&#x27;s trademarked slogan, &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Invent the Chicken, Just the Chicken Sandwich,&quot; refers to their flagship menu item, the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich. Though Chick-fil-A was the first national chain to make a fast, fried chicken sandwich its flagship item, it has been shown that Cathy&#x27;s claim to have &quot;invented the chicken sandwich&quot; is false.

From 1964 to 1967, the sandwich was licensed to over fifty eateries, including Waffle House and the concession stands of the new Houston Astrodome. The Chick-Fil-A sandwich was withdrawn from sale at other restaurants when the first dedicated location opened in 1967, in the food court of the Greenbriar Mall in Atlanta.

The chain expanded in the 1970s and early 1980s by opening new locations in suburban malls&#x27; food courts. The first freestanding location was opened April 16, 1986, on North Druid Hills Road in Atlanta, Georgia, and the company began to focus more on stand-alone units rather than food courts. Although it has expanded outward from its original geographic base, most new restaurants are located in suburban areas of the Southern US.

Since 1997, the Atlanta-based company has sponsored the Peach Bowl, an annual college football bowl game played in Atlanta on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Chick-fil-A also sponsors the Southeastern Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference of college athletics.

In 2008, Chick-fil-A was among the first fast-food restaurants to become completely free of trans fats.

In October 2015, the company opened its largest restaurant, a three-story restaurant in Manhattan.

On December 17, 2017, Chick-fil-A broke their tradition and opened on a Sunday to prepare meals for passengers left stranded during a power outage at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport; further, on January 13, 2019, a Chick-fil-A franchise in Mobile, Alabama, opened on Sunday to honor a birthday wish of a 14-year-old boy with cerebral palsy and autism.

On February 13, 2023, they began offering their first non-meat sandwich, a breaded cauliflower sandwich.

In May 2023, Chick-fil-A closed its original location in Greenbriar Mall, without stating a reason.

==Business model==
Chick-fil-A&#x27;s business strategy involves a focus on a small menu and on customer service. While many fast food chains offer many dishes, Chick-fil-A&#x27;s is focused on selling chicken sandwiches. The name&#x27;s capital A is intended to indicate that their chicken is &quot;grade A top quality&quot;. The company&#x27;s emphasis on customer service is reported to have contributed to its success and growth in the United States.

Chick-fil-A builds and owns its restaurants. Chick-fil-A franchisees need a US$10,000 initial investment. Franchisees are selected and trained, a process that can take months.

Chick-fil-A grossed an average of $6.71 million per restaurant in 2022 despite opening only 6 days a week, the highest sales of all fast-food restaurants in the United States. (Raising Cane&#x27;s was second with $5.44 million per restaurant average).

In 2019, Chick-fil-A reported $11.3 billion in sales in the United States, behind only McDonald&#x27;s with $40.4 billion in sales that year.

To compete with Chick-fil-A, the fried chicken chain Popeyes, followed by others, introduced a fried chicken sandwich in 2019, a marketing trend known as the Chicken Sandwich Wars.

=== Retail sale of sauces ===
In the spring of 2020, Chick-fil-A test-trialed the sale of two of their dipping sauces at some supermarkets in Florida, with all profits earmarked for a scholarship fund for the company&#x27;s store-level employees. The trial was considered successful, and distribution was expanded nationwide by 2021. Two more sauces were added in 2023.

In October 2022, the company trialed expansion of the program to include its salad dressings in the Cincinnati metropolitan area and in parts of Tennessee, and expanded nationwide in spring 2023.

In January 2025, Chick-fil-A announced plans to centralize its lemonade production by moving it from its restaurant locations to a single, automated facility in California. This new plant is capable of processing between 30 and 35 truckloads of lemons daily, with each truckload containing 50,000 pounds of lemons.

==Corporate culture==
S. Truett Cathy was a devout Southern Baptist; his religious beliefs had a major impact on the company. The company&#x27;s official statement of corporate purpose says that the business exists &quot;To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.&quot; Cathy opposed the company becoming public for religious and personal reasons.

A company spokesperson said in 2012, &quot;The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our Restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect –regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender.&quot;

===Sunday closing===
In accordance with the founder&#x27;s belief in the Christian doctrine of first-day Sabbatarianism, all Chick-fil-A locations are closed on Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Cathy said &quot;Our decision to close on Sunday was our way of honoring God and of directing our attention to things that mattered more than our business.&quot;

In an interview with ABC News&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot;, Truett&#x27;s son Dan T. Cathy told reporter Vicki Mabrey that the company is also closed on Sundays because &quot;by the time Sunday came, he was just worn out. And Sunday was not a big trading day, anyway, at the time. So he was closed that first Sunday and we&#x27;ve been closed ever since. He figured if he didn&#x27;t like working on Sundays, that other people didn&#x27;t either.&quot;

Even Chick-fil-A locations at sports stadiums close on Sundays, although many games are played on Sundays.

===Lenten observance===

During the Western Christian liturgical season of Lent, has in the past promoted fish sandwiches, following the Christian tradition of abstinence from meat during Lent. They no longer offer this product.

===Serving chicken without antibiotics===

In February 2014, Chick-fil-A announced plans to serve chicken raised without antibiotics in its restaurants nationwide within five years, the first fast-food restaurant to make this commitment. This was implemented by May 2019. Later the company stated that &quot;to maintain supply of the high-quality chicken&quot;, they would shift from a policy of No Antibiotics Ever (NAE) to No Antibiotics Important To Human Medicine (NAIHM) starting in the spring of 2024. In March 2024, Chick-fil-A announced it would depart from the company&#x27;s previous commitment of using only &quot;antibiotic-free&quot; chicken.

===Removal of additives===
In 2011, food blogger and activist Vani Hari noted that Chick-fil-A sandwiches contained nearly 100 ingredients, including peanut oil preserved with tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), made from butane. In October 2012, Chick-fil-A invited Hari to meet with company executives at its headquarters. In December 2013, Chick-fil-A said that it was removing high-fructose corn syrup and artificial dyes, and was testing a new peanut oil. Like other companies, Chick-fil-A does not publicly announce such changes unless already in the news, because it focuses on these ingredients.

==International locations==

===Canada===

In September 1994, Chick-fil-A opened its first location outside of the United States inside a student centre food court at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta. This location did not perform very well and was closed within two or three years. The company opened an outlet at the Calgary International Airport in Alberta in May 2014, and closed it in 2019.

Chick-fil-A opened a restaurant in Toronto, Ontario, on September 6, 2019, in the Yonge and Bloor Street area. There were protests criticizing the company&#x27;s violation of animal rights and &quot;history of supporting anti-LGBTQ causes&quot;. Chick-fil-A announced that it would open two other locations in Toronto during 2019, and 12 additional stores in the Greater Toronto Area over the subsequent five years. The chain&#x27;s second Toronto location opened at the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in January 2020.

The company expanded to other areas of Ontario in 2021, opening standalone locations with drive-through restaurants in Kitchener in August and Windsor in October.

In 2024, the company opened locations in Alberta, one being in the Phase III food court of West Edmonton Mall in Edmonton. and the other being in Calgary located on Macleod Trail.

In 2025, despite freezing cold, hundreds of customers started lining up outside the restaurant as early as five in the morning in Cambridge, Ontario.

===South Africa===
In August 1996, Chick-fil-A opened its first location outside of North America by building a restaurant in Durban, South Africa. A second location was opened in Johannesburg in November 1997. Neither was profitable, and they were closed in 2001.

=== United Kingdom ===
A Chick-fil-A operated in Edinburgh during the Spring of 2018. On October 10, 2019, Chick-fil-A returned to Europe, with the opening of a store at The Oracle shopping centre in Reading, UK. The store closed in March 2020 after The Oracle opted not to continue the lease of the location beyond the six-month pilot period in the face of continued protests over the chain&#x27;s anti-LGBTQ stance.

In February 2019, Chick-fil-A opened a store on a 12-month pilot scheme in Aviemore, Scotland. The store was closed in January 2020 amidst protests and controversy from locals and customers regarding the chain&#x27;s former donations to charities supporting anti-LGBT rights causes. Chick-fil-A said that they had always planned a short-term stay at the location.

Later, the company changed some policies, appointing its first head of diversity in 2020, and focused its charitable activities on education and hunger alleviation rather than opponents of same-sex marriage. In September 2023, the company planned to open five restaurants in the UK from early 2025, investing over $100M over the following ten years in the UK. The chain said that it would apply its charitable policies, including a $25,000 donation to a local organization on opening a Chick-fil-A restaurant and donation of surplus food to local charitable causes, to its UK branches too.

Chick-fil-A have opened their first full UK restaurant in Lisburn, Northern Ireland in January 2025, followed by a second one in Templepatrick, Northern Ireland in February 2025 under a partnership with Welcome Break, a subsidiary of Applegreen.

===Puerto Rico===
Chick-fil-A opened its first location in Puerto Rico in 2022 and has now expanded to seven restaurants with the plan for up to 25 locations by 2030. The unique menu includes coffee 100% grown and roasted in Puerto Rico.

=== Expansion to Asia and Europe ===
Chick-fil-A CEO Andrew Cathy announced in March2023 that it planned to open restaurants in Asia and Europe by 2026, and was set to expand to five overseas markets by 2030. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that it was seeking countries with &quot;stable economies, dense populations, and a demand for chicken&quot;.

====Singapore====
Chick-fil-A opened a pop-up restaurant at Esplanade Mall for three days from June 26 through 28, 2024, being the first Asian country to host a Chick-fil-A pop-up. On October 17, 2024, Chick-fil-A officially announced it would be opening in Singapore in late 2025, making the first Asian country to open the brand, and would be investing US$75 million into its first restaurant in the country for 10 years.

==Planned locations==

In July 2018, Chick-fil-A announced it would be opening its first location in Hawaii in Kahului in early 2022, with additional locations in Honolulu and Kapoleo to follow. The first Puerto Rican location opened on March 3, 2022, in Bayamón.

==Advertising==

&quot;Eat Mor Chikin&quot; is the chain&#x27;s most prominent advertising slogan, created by The Richards Group in 1995. The slogan is often seen in advertisements featuring Holstein dairy cows that are often seen wearing (or holding) signs that (usually) read &quot;Eat Mor Chikin&quot; in capital letters. The ad campaign was temporarily halted on January 1, 2004, during a mad cow disease scare, so as not to make the chain seem insensitive or appear to be taking advantage of the scare to increase its sales. Two months later, the cows were put up again. The cows replaced the chain&#x27;s old mascot, Doodles, an anthropomorphized chicken that still appears as the C on the logo.

Chick-fil-A vigorously protects its intellectual property, sending cease and desist letters to those they think have infringed on their trademarks. The corporation has successfully protested at least 30 instances of the use of an &quot;eat more&quot; phrase, saying that the use would cause confusion of the public, dilute the distinctiveness of their intellectual property, and diminish its value.

A 2011 letter to Vermont artist Bo Muller-Moore who screen prints T-shirts reading: &quot;Eat More Kale&quot; demanded that he cease printing the shirts and turn over his website. The incident drew criticism from Vermont governor Peter Shumlin, and created backlash against what he termed Chick-fil-A&#x27;s &quot;corporate bullying&quot;. On December 11, 2014, Bo Muller-Moore announced that the U.S. Patent Office granted his application to trademark his &quot;Eat More Kale&quot; phrase. A formal announcement of his victory took place on December 12, 2014, with Shumlin and other supporters on the Statehouse steps. His public fight drew regional and national attention, the support of Shumlin, and a team of pro-bono law students from the University of New Hampshire legal clinic.

After 22 years with The Richards Group, Chick-fil-A switched to McCann New York in 2016. Along with the cows, ads included famous people in history in a campaign called &quot;Chicken for Breakfast. It&#x27;s not as crazy as you think.&quot;

==Sponsored events==
;Chick-fil-A Classic
:The Chick-fil-A Classic is a high school basketball tournament held in Columbia, South Carolina, featuring nationally ranked players and teams. The tournament is co-sponsored by the Greater Columbia Educational Advancement Foundation (GCEAF), which provides scholarships to high school seniors in the greater Columbia area.

;Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl
:The Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl, first known as the Peach Bowl until 2006 and renamed Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl in 2014, is a college football bowl game played each year in Atlanta, Georgia.

;Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game

It was also two games in 2017. On July 12, 2023, Georgia-based insurance company Aflac, became the new sponsor of the game.

==Controversies==
===Same-sex marriage===

Chick-fil-A has donated over $5 million, via the WinShape Foundation, to groups that oppose same-sex marriage. In response, students at several colleges and universities worked to ban or remove the company&#x27;s restaurants from their campuses.

In June and July 2012, Chick-fil-A&#x27;s chief operating officer Dan T. Cathy made several public statements about same-sex marriage, saying that those who &quot;have the audacity to define what marriage is about&quot; were &quot;inviting God&#x27;s judgment on our nation&quot;. Several prominent politicians expressed disapproval. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and Chicago Alderman Proco &quot;Joe&quot; Moreno said they hoped to block franchise expansion into their areas. The proposed local bans drew criticism from liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union.

The Jim Henson Company, which had a &quot;Pajanimals&quot; kids&#x27; meal toy licensing arrangement with Chick-fil-A, said it would cease its business relationship, and donate the payment to the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. Chick-fil-A stopped distributing the toys, claiming that unrelated safety concerns had arisen before the controversy. Chick-fil-A released a statement on July 31, 2012, saying, &quot;We are a restaurant company focused on food, service, and hospitality; our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.&quot;

In response to the controversy, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee initiated a Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day movement to counter a boycott of Chick-fil-A launched by same-sex marriage activists. Many of the chain&#x27;s stores reported record levels of customers that day. The United States Federal Aviation Administration also responded to two cities that were preventing Chick-fil-A from opening in their international airport, citing &quot;Federal requirements prohibit airport operators from excluding persons on the basis of religious creed from participating in airport activities that receive or benefit from FAA grant funding.&quot;

In April 2018, Chick-fil-A reportedly continued to donate to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which opposes gay marriage. In a November 18, 2019, interview, Chick-fil-A president Tim Tassopoulos said the company would stop donating to The Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.

===Drive-through traffic===
The popularity of Chick-fil-A&#x27;s drive-throughs in the United States has led to traffic problems, police interventions, and complaints by neighboring businesses in more than 20 states. The long drive-through lines have been reported to cause traffic backups, blocking emergency vehicles and city buses and increasing the risk of collisions and pedestrian injuries.

In 2025, the company reported that up to 60% of its sales are from drive-through traffic.

===Hapeville Dwarf House===
Truett Cathy opened his first restaurant in 1946, The Dwarf Grill – later renamed the Dwarf House – in Hapeville, Georgia, and developed the pressure-cooked chicken breast sandwich there. At the original Chick-fil-A Dwarf Grill, there is also an extra small-sized front door in addition to the full-size entrances.

The original Dwarf House in Hapeville, Georgia is open 24 hours a day, six days a week, except on Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The store closes at 10:00 p.m.. on Saturday nights and the day before Thanksgiving and Christmas and reopens at 6 p.m. on Monday mornings and the day after Thanksgiving and Christmas. It has a larger dine-in menu than the other Dwarf House locations, and an animated seven-dwarf display is at the back of the restaurant. It was across the street from the former Ford Motor Company factory called Atlanta Assembly.

===Dwarf House===
Opened in 1986, Truett&#x27;s original, full-service restaurants offer a substantial menu and provide customers with table service, walk-up counter service, or a drive-thru window. There are currently five of the original eleven Chick-fil-A Dwarf House restaurants still operating in the metro Atlanta area, including Duluth, Riverdale, Jonesboro, Forest Park and Fayetteville.

===Truett&#x27;s Grill===
In 1996, the first Truett&#x27;s Grill was opened in Morrow, Georgia. The second location opened in 2003 in McDonough, Georgia, and a third location opened in 2006 in Griffin, Georgia. Similar to the Chick-fil-A Dwarf Houses, these independently owned restaurants offer traditional, sit-down dining and expanded menu selections in a diner-themed restaurant. In 2017, Chick-fil-A demolished several Dwarf House locations to replace them with Truett&#x27;s Grill locations.

===Truett&#x27;s Chick-fil-A===
Truett&#x27;s Chick-fil-A is designed in honor of founder S. Truett Cathy. The restaurant is decorated with family photos and favorite quotes of the restaurant founder. The restaurant offers drive-thru, counter, and sit-down service for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. There are four locations including Newnan, Rome, Stockbridge, and Woodstock, Georgia.

===Truett&#x27;s Luau===
Truett Cathy visited Hawaii; at the age of 92, he opened Truett&#x27;s Luau in Fayetteville, Georgia, in 2013. The menu includes island favorites with a southern US spin. The restaurant offers sit-down, counter, and drive-thru service.

<text>Dwayne Rudolph Goettel (February 1, 1964August 23, 1995) was a Canadian electronic musician, best known for his work in the industrial music group Skinny Puppy. Starting his career playing for a variety of acts around Edmonton, he joined Skinny Puppy in 1986 following the departure of keyboardist Bill Leeb. A classically trained pianist, he helped to broaden Skinny Puppy&#x27;s sound with his extensive knowledge of equipment and sampling. He assisted bandmate cEvin Key on a number of side projects such as The Tear Garden and Doubting Thomas, and helped form the experimental electronic group Download. He also created the independent record label Subconscious Communications with friend and colleague Phil Western as a means to release his solo work.

In 1993, Skinny Puppy moved to Los Angeles to produce their eighth studio album, &quot;The Process&quot;, through American Recordings. The production was marred by rampant drug use and band infighting, and ultimately halted in 1995 when vocalist Nivek Ogre quit the band. Goettel and Key, in an attempt to salvage the album, returned to Canada with the master tapes. Goettel went into rehab for his drug addictions and returned to live with his parents in Edmonton. On August 23, 1995, Goettel was found dead at the age of 31 in his parents&#x27; home; he had died from a heroin overdose. &quot;The Process&quot; was eventually completed and released in his memory.

==Life and career==
===Early ventures and Skinny Puppy (1980-1988)===

Goettel&#x27;s interest in making music developed when his family moved from High Level, Alberta, where he played trumpet for his high school band, to Edmonton. While there, he learned to play piano and began participating in the local music scene. His first piece of equipment was the Korg MS-20, which he bought for $800. &quot;I didn&#x27;t even tell my parents. I&#x27;m up in my room, my mom walks in and she&#x27;s like &#x27;What&#x27;s that!&#x27; And I&#x27;m sitting there with all these little keys and buttons going &#x27;piszzshew&#x27;&quot;. He met Darrin and Stephen Huss in 1982 and formed the band Psyche, one of only a handful of electronic acts in Edmonton at the time. He contributed keyboards for the group and joined them for their live debut in December that year. He was also involved with the band Voice, helping them record their debut EP, &quot;Anno di Voce&quot;, before they changed their name to Office. Goettel formed the band Water with longtime acquaintance Mandy Cousins (also known as Sandy Weir) in 1985. The duo recorded demos in an Edmonton night club called Krieg, but never released their material commercially.

Goettel met Skinny Puppy in 1985 when Water opened for the band as part of their &quot;Bites&quot; tour. He had impressed founder and keyboardist cEvin Key with his performance and the two befriended each other. Key asked him to join Skinny Puppy when it had become apparent that keyboardist Bill Leeb was uninterested in continuing on with the band. Goettel joined in 1986 during the recording of their second album, &quot;&quot;, on which he made his first contributions. Goettel&#x27;s extensive technical knowledge and experience in production helped to bring variety to Skinny Puppy&#x27;s music and steered them away from their synth-pop roots towards a more uniquely industrial sound. He quickly immersed himself into the group and its musical approach, and began applying new techniques in the band&#x27;s implementation of noise.

Their sound continued to evolve with 1987&#x27;s &quot;Cleanse Fold and Manipulate&quot;, which marked the beginning of the group&#x27;s exploration into more experimental territory. Their follow-up a year later, &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot;, saw the group touring in support of animal rights. On stage, Goettel assisted Key as both a keyboardist and percussionist while singer Nivek Ogre acted out his elaborate theatrics. While performing in Cincinnati, an audience member mistook a stuffed dog Ogre was dissecting to be a real animal and alerted the authorities. Two plainclothes officers entered the band&#x27;s dressing room and arrested Ogre, Key, and tour manager Dan McGee for disorderly conduct. Goettel, who mistook the officers for fans and had been rolling a joint in the corner of the room, was able to leave before the arrests were made.

===Growing tensions and side projects (1989-1992)===
In 1989, Skinny Puppy released the album &quot;Rabies&quot; which featured Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen. The album was a commercial success for the group but had received a mixed reception from fans. Goettel had initially been happy with the album, saying that he enjoyed working with Jourgensen and that it was his favorite Puppy album to date. &quot;We all like it, and I can see the worry in people&#x27;s eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t worry us. We did it, and we like it, and I&#x27;m not worried about doing another just like it, you know?&quot; He thought it was natural for Skinny Puppy to team up with Jourgensen and make an album, and believed it was the best option at the time. He later changed his position, telling &quot;Alternative Press&quot; in 1991 that while some of the material on &quot;Rabies&quot; was good, the completed product was &quot;less within the Skinny Puppy vision&quot;, a sentiment his bandmates agreed with. He told Peter Day of WMXM 88.9 that &quot;Rabies&quot; was simply the result of a crossroads of ideas:

 Almost in a way it allowed us to go back and re-emphasize where it is we&#x27;re coming from in the first place ... I mean, at the time the way things were going, Ogre was exploring a lot of things and wanted to go out and do things and at the same time, Kevin and myself were doing other projects. It seemed natural, it seemed like the thing that was required at that time ... Skinny Puppy fans were writing us saying, &#x27;What&#x27;s happened to you guys you guys aren&#x27;t gonna go all hard core on us now.&#x27; Obviously were not going to do a Ministry trip exactly. What good is it if everybody is listening to hardcore guitars right now. Skinny Puppy obviously is going to flirt with it, but that&#x27;s Al&#x27;s trip, so he can take it and go wherever that&#x27;s supposed to go.

Conflict arose within the band, with Goettel and Key often siding against Ogre, who they felt had lost interest in working with Skinny Puppy and wanted a solo career. Following the production, Goettel and Key took a brief hiatus from the group and moved to Toronto to work on other projects. The duo formed Hilt with Key&#x27;s longtime associate Al Nelson and released the album &quot;Call the Ambulance Before I Hurt Myself&quot; in 1990. Goettel said he preferred the atmosphere when recording with Hilt to that of Skinny Puppy, believing it to be more enjoyable experience. Another project, Doubting Thomas, served to showcase the material the duo had written for Skinny Puppy but was considered &quot;too mellow&quot; to make the cut. Goettel also helped with Key and Bill Leeb&#x27;s project called Cyberaktif, which he said was his least favorite of the side projects. Pleased with the work he was doing, Goettel was unsure if Skinny Puppy would ever return from the fallout of &quot;Rabies&quot;. &quot;Just the fact that there was so much satisfaction coming from outside Skinny Puppy led to that feeling of &#x27;The End&#x27;&quot;.

However, the duo returned to Vancouver and reunited with Ogre at Mushroom Studios to produce 1990&#x27;s &quot;Too Dark Park&quot;. A year later, the group were recording their final album for Nettwerk Records, &quot;Last Rights&quot;. The production was &quot;tense and unhealthy&quot; with the band working in shifts; Goettel and Key would use the studio by day while Ogre came in at night under the supervision of producer Dave &quot;Rave&quot; Ogilvie. Goettel and Key had access to new digital editing equipment which allowed them to spend more time on post-production than on previous records. For the track &quot;Download&quot;, Goettel spent two months collecting and composing an array of sounds to be used for the song, and with the assistance of Anthony Valcic, edited them together during a 14 hour long session. That same year, Goettel returned with Key and Legendary Pink Dots singer Edward Ka-Spel for the release of The Tear Garden&#x27;s &quot;The Last Man to Fly&quot;, having joined them previously for 1987&#x27;s &quot;Tired Eyes Slowly Burning&quot;.

===&quot;The Process&quot; and final years (1993-1995)===
Their contract with Nettwerk complete, the band signed to Rick Rubin&#x27;s American Recordings and moved to Los Angeles to begin recording their next album, &quot;The Process&quot;. Rather than work in shifts as they had in the past, the band decided to record the album together, an idea that was pushed by Rubin. The production was frequently stalled due to fires and floods, as well as by the Northridge Earthquake. Band infighting arose once more and was exacerbated by drug problems, including Goettel&#x27;s increasing reliance on heroin, a drug he once swore to never use. Concerned with the ineffectiveness of American&#x27;s producers in getting Ogre to write and sing, Goettel joined Key during band meetings to demand that Rave be brought in to assist. Tensions were fueled further by the fact that when Ogre did write, he preferred to work with Key&#x27;s demos instead of Goettel&#x27;s.

Amid the chaos, Goettel found time to work on his more techno driven solo work, which he made under the pseudonym aDuck. To release his work, he and his friend Phil Western created the independent record label Subconscious Communications. Together, they released the &quot;aDuck/Philth&quot; split twelve-inch single in 1993. Limited to 200 copies, the single featured the aDuck song &quot;Power&quot; on one side, and a song from Western (who used the name Philth) called &quot;My Heart is Being Touched By Christ&quot; on the other. Another aDuck song, &quot;Phenethylamine Backwash&quot;, was released later in the year on a techno compilation compiled by Bill Leeb and Michael Balch. That same year, Goettel was credited as a keyboardist on Sister Machine Gun&#x27;s debut &quot;Sins of the Flesh&quot;. In 1995, he helped Key establish the band Download as a side project to Skinny Puppy. Their first album, titled &quot;Furnace&quot;, was released following Goettel&#x27;s death.

Ogre quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995, prompting Rubin to halt funding for the album. Goettel and Key returned to Vancouver with the master tapes in hand, intending to complete the album there. Following Goettel&#x27;s death in August, Rubin allotted funds so that Key, with the help of Rave, could see to the completion of the album.

==Musical style==

Goettel spoke to &quot;Alternative Press&quot; on how being in Skinny Puppy helped him jump outside the musical boundaries he had felt confined to in the past, saying &quot;[Key] showed me that when you start on a C, you can play more than just these certain notes, that you can do whatever the moment demands of you, instead of looking blindly backwards&quot;. Ogre recalled in 2007, &quot;cEvin had a good sense of melody, but Dwayne was classically trained ... It was part of their duality in that Dwayne shared his vast knowledge of music, and cEvin showed him how to fuck it all up&quot;. Goettel&#x27;s experience with the use of the Ensoniq Mirage sampler proved to be pivotal to the band&#x27;s evolving sound, with Key dubbing him &quot;the master of sampling&quot;. Goettel told the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1992 that he felt joining Skinny Puppy helped to liberate him from the normal conventions of music making:

In all the music I had played before, there wasn&#x27;t anything about expressing yourself, just rigid lines ... I came into the band with all this knowledge, but that knowledge was very limiting. These guys were sitting around listening to tapes and going: &#x27;Yeah! We can make new sound! We can do anything!&#x27; It was a doorway to all these possibilities.

He discovered an interest in synthesizers early in his life and began listening to electronic acts such as Kraftwerk, Devo, Soft Cell, and Yello while in high school. With Skinny Puppy, he used Steinberg Pro 24 software run through an Atari computer to mix and edit their music. In addition to the Ensoniq Mirage, his equipment included the Akai S1000, Yamaha SY77, Yamaha SY22, and the E-mu Emax. Goettel told &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot; that Skinny Puppy was attempting to &quot;provide something that makes you question the things you sense&quot;, and was uninterested in pushing the band&#x27;s music towards something more trendy. &quot;It&#x27;s not like we have to do the things we do, it&#x27;s more that everything else is already taken care of on the radio - love, relationships, people&quot;. Key said in 2001 that he believed Goettel&#x27;s later work was at the forefront of the &quot;pre-Prodigy style&quot;.

==Death==
In the months leading to his death, Goettel confided to Key that he had not curbed his use of heroin, despite telling others that he had cleaned up. Key and his friends sought to help him and adopted a Narcotics Anonymous style of approach to the situation. Shortly before his death, he had become self-destructive to the point where in one instance, according to Ogre, he had shaved his head and wrapped barbed wire around his arms. After Skinny Puppy disbanded, he spent a month in an Edmonton rehab center before returning to the studio to work on the Download album &quot;Furnace&quot;. He was later readmitted to rehab where he was placed on suicide watch after slashing his arms. On August 23, 1995, Goettel, age 31, was found dead from an apparent heroin overdose at his parents home in Edmonton.

Goettel&#x27;s sister had notified Key of his death. &quot;It was the weirdest, oddest déjà vu ... It was almost as though I had lived it in a dream&quot;. Goettel&#x27;s father, Rudy, said his son was a well liked person and had always avoided confrontation with others. He said that the family had received hundreds of phone calls from fans around the world who wished to express their sympathies. Ogre gave his condolences to the family and called Goettel Skinny Puppy&#x27;s &quot;genius behind the curtain&quot;. Key told &quot;Chart&quot; magazine in 1998 that Goettel was &quot;a ranger and rover&quot; who was thoroughly familiar with psychedelic experiences:

 He was endorsing acid all the time and everyone felt he was in control and didn&#x27;t consider him a risk to hurt himself ... Its [heroin’s] rally is the ultimate devil drug in that it fools you into thinking that you can try it a couple of times and you are O.K. ... The recovery from heroin is a really bitter road. It&#x27;s like you have to get over the flu before you can walk. And I think Dwayne got stuck. He wasn&#x27;t able to.

Both &quot;The Process&quot; and &quot;Furnace&quot;, the final albums Goettel worked on, were dedicated in his memory. Skinny Puppy reunited in August 2000 for a one-off show at Dresden&#x27;s Doomsday Festival. Rather than hire a new keyboardist, the band left the keyboard station on stage empty in honor of Goettel&#x27;s memory. Footage Goettel had shot during Skinny Puppy&#x27;s 1988 &quot;Head Trauma&quot; tour in Europe was assembled and edited by Ogre into a 32-minute long documentary called &quot;Eurotrauma: Skinny Puppy Live In Europe 1988&quot; and released with the 2005 live film &quot;The Greater Wrong of the Right Live&quot;. In 2010, the band Psyche released the album &quot;Re-membering Dwayne&quot;, which featured music the group had made while Goettel was a member.

<doc id="461770" wikidata="Q24434" url="?curid=461770" title="Eddington number">
<text>In astrophysics, the Eddington number, , is the number of protons in the observable universe. Eddington originally calculated it as about ; current estimates make it approximately .

The term is named for British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington, who in 1940 was the first to propose a value of and to explain why this number might be important for physical cosmology and the foundations of physics.

== History ==

Eddington argued that the value of the fine-structure constant, &quot;α&quot;, could be obtained by pure deduction. He related &quot;α&quot; to the Eddington number, which was his estimate of the number of protons in the universe. This led him in 1929 to conjecture that &quot;α&quot; was exactly 1/136. He devised a &quot;proof&quot; that , or about . Other physicists did not adopt this conjecture and did not accept his argument. It even led to a major journal publishing a joke article making fun of the idea.

During a course of lectures that he delivered in 1938 as Tarner Lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge, Eddington averred that:

This large number was soon named the &quot;Eddington number&quot;.

Shortly thereafter, improved measurements of &quot;α&quot; yielded values closer to 1/137, whereupon Eddington changed his &quot;proof&quot; to show that &quot;α&quot; had to be exactly 1/137.

Current estimates of &quot;N&quot;Edd point to a value of about . These estimates assume that all matter can be taken to be hydrogen and require assumed values for the number and size of galaxies and stars in the universe.

== Recent theory ==
The modern CODATA recommended value of &quot;α&quot; is 

Consequently, no reliable source maintains any longer that &quot;α&quot; is the reciprocal of an integer, nor does anyone take seriously a mathematical relationship between &quot;α&quot; and &quot;N&quot;Edd.

On possible roles for &quot;N&quot;Edd in contemporary cosmology, especially its connection with large number coincidences, see (easier) and (harder).

<doc id="461771" wikidata="Q9587" url="?curid=461771" title="Final Cut Pro">
<text>Final Cut Pro (often abbreviated FCP or FCPX) is a professional non-linear video-editing application initially developed by Macromedia, and, since 1998, by Apple as part of its pro apps collection. Final Cut Pro allows users to import, edit, and process video footage, and output it to a wide variety of formats. 

In the 2000s, Final Cut Pro developed a large and expanding user base, mainly video hobbyists and independent filmmakers. It also made inroads with film and television editors who have traditionally used Avid Media Composer. According to a 2007 SCRI study, Final Cut Pro made up 49% of the United States professional editing market, with Avid at 22%. A published survey in 2008 by the American Cinema Editors Guild placed their users at 21% Final Cut Pro (and growing from previous surveys of this group), while all others were on an Avid system of some kind. In 2011, Final Cut Pro 7 was replaced with the fully rewritten Final Cut Pro X, which initially lacked many features from previous versions, though frequent updates have brought back many of these features. Final Cut Pro for iPad was made available on May 23, 2023.

==Features==
Final Cut Pro provides non-linear, non-destructive editing of any QuickTime-compatible video format including DV, HDV, P2 MXF (DVCProHD), XDCAM (via plug-in), 2K, 4K, 5K, and 8K film formats and can import projects directly from iMovie for iOS and iPadOS. It supports a number of simultaneously composited video tracks (limited mainly by video form capability); unlimited audio tracks; multi-camera editing for combining video from multiple camera sources (referred to as angles); 360º video editing support; as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions. It comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters such as keying tools, mattes and vocal de-poppers and de-essers. It also has multiple color-correction tools including color wheels, sliders and curves, video scopes and a selection of generators, such as slugs, test cards, and noise.

The functionality of Final Cut Pro can be extended with plug-ins which may provide additional effects, titles, transitions, and more. Apple maintains the APIs and documentation for everyone to develop such plug-ins.

=== Interface ===

* Event browser: Replacing “bins” in other NLEs, the event browser is where the original media is found and can be searched and sorted by various forms of metadata. Keyword ranges, favorite and rejected ranges, and smart collections allow for faster sorting of a large number of clips.
* Magnetic timeline: Inventing an alternative to track-based timelines found in traditional NLEs, Final Cut&#x27;s magnetic timeline uses clip connections to keep connected clips and secondary storylines in sync with clips located on the primary storyline. By default, clips move around each other &quot;magnetically&quot;, filling in any gaps and avoiding clip collisions by automatically bumping clips out of the way vertically. The magnetic connections are also user-definable.
* Roles: In order to separate and organize different audio types on the magnetic timeline, editors can designate what &quot;role&#x27; each clip plays. Introduced in version 10.0.1, Roles can be assigned to clips as an alternate way of creating organizational functionality. A Role (or Sub-Role) gets assigned to clips to identify what it is (for example Video, Titles, Dialogue, Effects, Music). Upon Sharing a Master File of the Project the various Roles can be split out as stems or in a multitrack file for broadcast delivery or other distribution needs.
* Content auto-analysis: Found in the import window and event browser is the option to analyze media for shot type and facial recognition or fix potential problems like audio loudness, audio hum, channel grouping, background noise, color balance, pulldown removal, and stabilization. This process generates metadata that can automatically be organized as Keywords and can be grouped into Smart Collections.
* Synchronized clips: Video and audio clips recorded on separate devices can be synched automatically by timecode, audio waveforms, and markers together as a single clip.
* Compound clips: Nested sequences from the original Final Cut Pro have been replaced by compound clips. A selection of video and audio clips can be nested into a single compound clip. This compound clip can be opened in its own timeline or broken apart for further editing. It can also be reused in different projects.
* Closed captions: Introduced in version 10.4.1, closed captions can be created right in the timeline or imported into the timeline from an external file.
* Multicam editing: Introduced in version 10.0.3, multiple camera angles can be synchronized automatically and combined into a multicam clip. Once in the timeline, a multicam clip can be cut up into different angles by using the angle viewer. A multicam clip can be opened in the angle editor where new angles can be added, synched, relabeled, and rearranged at any time.
* Auditions: Clips can be grouped together in the event browser or on the timeline as auditions. Once in the timeline, an audition allows the user to choose between different clips in their edit while the timeline ripples automatically in order to preview two or more different versions of a cut.
* 3D titles: Introduced in version 10.2.0, text can be extruded, textured, lit, and shaded with materials and environments in 3D. This allows users to create titles like those found in Hollywood movies directly in the application.
* 360 degree video editing: Introduced in version 10.4. import and edit 360° equirectangular video in a wide range of formats and frame sizes.
* Advanced color grading
* Wide-gamut high dynamic range

=== Technical features ===
While inheriting the name from its predecessor, Final Cut Pro, Final Cut Pro X is a completely re-written application. As a native 64-bit application it takes advantage of more than 4GB of RAM. It utilizes all CPU cores with Grand Central Dispatch. Open CL support allows GPU accelerated processing for improved performance for playback, rendering, and transcoding. It is resolution-independent, supporting images sizes from SD to beyond 4K. Final Cut Pro X supports playback of many native camera and audio formats. It can also transcode video clips to the Apple ProRes codec for improved performance. Many tasks are performed in the background such as auto-saving, rendering, transcoding, and media management, allowing the user an uninterrupted experience. Final Cut Pro X was developed for macOS only.

; Motion 5
: Titles, motion graphics, effects generated in Motion 5 can be published to Final Cut Pro X. Inside the Final Cut Pro X, editors can modify the parameters and contents of the effects, as long as the permission for such modifications is turned on in the Motion 5 project file.

; Adobe Photoshop
: In Final Cut Pro X 10.0.3 and later, the editor can import Photoshop projects onto the storyline similar to a still image. A Photoshop project with layers is treated similar to a compound clip and the layers are preserved after being imported into the Final Cut Pro X. Individual layers of the Photoshop project can be toggled on or off inside the Final Cut Pro X by double-clicking the imported project and going into the compound clip editing panel. Other adjustments to the Photoshop project should be performed on the imported Photoshop project using Adobe Photoshop program with updates happening in real-time inside Final Cut Pro X.

== Ecosystem ==
Before version 10, Final Cut Pro could be extended using the FXScript scripting language.

Since its release, Final Cut Pro X has supported the construction of effect, transition, and title plugins by publishing custom-built effects from Apple Motion. This has led to a third-party ecosystem of developers building effects from simple color corrections to complex templates. Third-party plug-ins can also be created through Apple&#x27;s FxPlug API, the successor of FXScript. As Projects, Events, and Libraries are stored in a database format; this has allowed many third-party developers to build workflow tools by utilizing FCPXML.

==History==

=== Creation ===
Randy Ubillos led the team that developed the first three versions of Adobe Premiere. His group was then hired by Macromedia to develop KeyGrip, a more professional video editing program based on Apple&#x27;s QuickTime, for Macromedia. Niya C Sisk was retained by Macromedia to create the UI of KeyGrip in partnership with the engineering team. However, Macromedia was unable to release the product, since they had licensed a component from Truevision, and the latter had a licensing agreement with Microsoft that prohibited the component&#x27;s use in conjunction with QuickTime. As a result, and due to Macromedia&#x27;s decision to focus on the web market, it sold its desktop applications, including KeyGrip.

In 1998, KeyGrip was renamed Final Cut, and was demonstrated as a 0.9 alpha in a private room at the NAB Show. The demonstration showed both Mac and Windows versions of the software, with the Mac version using a Truevision RTX dual-stream real-time card with limited real-time effects. When no buyer was found for the program, Apple acquired the development team as a defensive measure. As Apple was unable to find a buyer for Final Cut, it continued development work, adding FireWire support and releasing the program as Final Cut Pro at NAB 1999.

=== Early versions ===
To ensure that Final Cut Pro had strong support for third-party self-paced and instructor-led training from the start, Apple partnered with DVcreators.net to release a training disc called &quot;Final Cut Pro PowerStart&quot; at the NAB show on the day of Final Cut Pro&#x27;s release. Apple also worked with DVcreators.net to host hundreds of free and paid Final Cut Pro seminars and workshops in 60 cities around the world in the following years, a strategy that some credit with significantly contributing to Final Cut Pro&#x27;s early market awareness and success.

After the release of Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere maintained a strong market share on Windows, but began to decline on Mac as its older codebase was more difficult to maintain. In 2003, Apple launched a trade-in program that allowed Premiere users to exchange their discs for a free copy of Final Cut Express or receive a $500 discount on Final Cut Pro.

One of the factors that contributed to the success of Final Cut Pro was the relative maturity of QuickTime and its native support for new DV cameras connected via FireWire. The first fully broadcast quality, globally distributed TV show produced using Final Cut Pro was Women of Wrestling in 2000, which used the Pinnacle CinéWave uncompressed video card. The Oxygen Network also used the software to produce shows such as SheCommerce during its network launch in early 2000.

In late 2001, independent producer Michael A. Bloom credited Final Cut Pro as being crucial to the production of his controversial film &quot;PlayCouples, A New Era of Swinging&quot; (2003). In an interview with Larry King, Bloom claimed that the relatively new platform did not fail once while rendering the film, unlike his experiences with Avid Media Composer. Bloom had been an advocate for Final Cut Pro since using it for beta testing under an agreement between his production company and The Oxygen Network. The studio motion picture &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; was also edited using beta versions of Final Cut Pro 3, demonstrating that successful 3:2 pulldown matchback to 24fps was possible with an easy-to-use software product. The film&#x27;s director, Roger Avary, became a spokesperson for Final Cut Pro, appearing in print advertisements worldwide. His endorsement of the product helped to give mainstream editors like Walter Murch confidence in its readiness for professional use. In August 2002, Final Cut Pro received a Primetime Emmy Engineering Award for its impact on the television industry.

=== Final Cut Pro 4 to 7 ===
Final Cut Pro 4 was released in April 2002, and included three new applications: Compressor for transcoding between video formats, LiveType for advanced titling (such as the creation of animated lower thirds), and Soundtrack for creating royalty-free music soundtracks. It also included Cinema Tools, which had previously been sold separately for filmmakers working with telecine.

In April 2004, Final Cut Pro 4.5 was released and branded as &quot;Final Cut Pro HD&quot; due to its native support for Panasonic&#x27;s tape-based DVCPRO HD format for compressed 720p and 1080i HD over FireWire. (While the software had been capable of uncompressed HD editing since version 3.0, it required expensive video cards and high-speed storage at the time.)

Final Cut Pro 5 was announced at a pre-NAB event in April 2005 and shipped in May of that year. It added support for the HDV format for compressed HD, which had previously been supported in Final Cut Pro&#x27;s scaled-down cousin, Final Cut Express. Final Cut Pro 5 also added support for Panasonic&#x27;s P2 format, which allowed for the recording of DVCPRO HD video to memory cards rather than tape.

In January 2006, Apple stopped selling Final Cut Pro as a standalone product and began offering it only as part of the Final Cut Studio bundle. In March 2006, a universal binary 5.1 version of Final Cut Pro was released as part of Final Cut Studio, and upgrades were made available by sending the original installation discs back to Apple with a fee. One notable difference in the Intel versions of Final Cut and Motion was that they no longer recognized After Effects plugins, but instead supported Apple&#x27;s own universal plugin architecture, FxPlug.

On April 15, 2007, Apple unveiled Final Cut Pro 6 as the centerpiece of the Final Cut Studio 2 bundle. Despite not having a booth at NAB 2009, the product was widely represented on the show floor by various vendors, including the Red Digital Cinema team, which relied heavily on Final Cut Pro during development.

On July 23, 2009, Final Cut Pro 7 (also referred to informally by users as Final Cut Studio 3) was released, though it remained a 32-bit application.

=== Final Cut Pro X ===
Final Cut Pro X was unveiled on April 12, 2011 at the NAB Show, and released to the Mac App Store on June 21, 2011 along with new versions of Motion and Compressor. Final Cut Pro X was fully-rewritten in 64-bit, with a new interface, workflow enhancements and improved automation, and new features such as ColorSync integration, a resolution-independent playback system, and Core Animation-based system scaling. As part of the release, Final Cut Studio was discontinued, along with Color, Soundtrack Pro, and DVD Studio Pro.

The reaction was extremely mixed, with veteran film editor Walter Murch initially refusing to use it, citing a lack of features compared to Final Cut Pro 7. Support for translating timelines from Final Cut Pro 7 to Final Cut Pro X was notably missing, requiring editors to preserve a copy of Final Cut Pro 7 to edit older projects. An online petition asking Apple to continue development of Final Cut Pro 7 or to sell it to a third-party gathered 1,600 signatures within a week. Some of the missing features in Final Cut Pro X that were essential for professional video production included the lack of an edit decision list (EDL), XML and Open Media Framework Interchange (OMF) support, the inability to import projects created in previous versions of Final Cut Pro, the absence of a multicam editing tool, missing support for third-party I/O hardware output, and videotape capture being limited to FireWire video devices, including capture with third-party hardware. These missing features were addressed within the first six months of the product&#x27;s life. EDL export, a product of the early days of videotape editing, is now supported through third-party software and creating an AAF (a newer version of OMF) for passing projects to Pro Tools through X2Pro. In a 2015 interview, Murch was much less critical of the tool and suggested that he was interested in using it. Other movie producers, have agreed that Final Cut Pro X&#x27;s initial shortcomings have been fixed.

One of the notable changes introduced in Final Cut Pro X was the Magnetic Timeline, which replaced the track-based timeline of previous versions. This initially caused issues with exporting audio stems for broadcast and distribution, but this was addressed with the release of version 10.0.1, which introduced Video and Audio Roles, allowing users to export multitrack QuickTime files or stems. Files can be exported as AFF using a third-party app called X2Pro or through Logic Pro X.

With version 10.0.6 released on October 23, 2012, Apple added native support for Redcode Raw and MXF through a third party plugin. Prior to the introduction of version 10.1, Project and Event Libraries were separate folders. Events contained all the original media and Project Libraries contained the actual edited Projects on timelines. The Project and Event Libraries were stored in a user&#x27;s Movie folder or on the root level of an external hard drive. These Libraries automatically opened in Final Cut Pro X depending on which hard drives were mounted. That all changed on December 19, 2013, when Project and Event Libraries were merged into a new Library model. Libraries contained Events which in turn contained Projects. And unlike before Libraries could be opened and closed by the user. Media could be stored internally in the Library or kept outside the Library. Media management was further refined in version 10.1.2, released on June 27, 2014. MXF import, edit, and export became natively supported with version 10.1.4.

Version 10.2, released during the NAB Show 2015, introduced 3D Titles in both Final Cut Pro X and Motion. The Color Board was merged with a new Color Correction effect to allow for more flexibility in stacking layers of effects, and Apple added the ability to apply Keying or Shape Masks to any effect. Version 10.3 introduced a redesigned interface with Magnetic Timeline 2, support for iXML metadata when importing audio, significantly improved audio editing, support for wide-gamut color and REC 2020 color import, edit, and export, and support for MXF-wrapped Apple ProRes.

Version 10.4 introduced color wheels and color curves, 360º video editing, and high-dynamic-range (HDR) video, and the HEVC and HEIF formats. In April 2018, Apple said that there were more than 2.5 million users of Final Cut Pro X. In version 10.4.1, released during the NAB Show 2018, closed captioning was added, along with support for ProRes RAW. In November 2020, in tandem with the release of macOS Big Sur, the X was dropped from the name, and the product became again known as Final Cut Pro.

<text>This list of military aircraft of [[Germany]] includes prototype, pre-production, and operational types. No distinction is drawn here between different services until 1991.

In 1990, the various air arms of the former German Democratic Republic were absorbed by their counterparts in the Federal Republic of Germany. Some types that had been operated by the GDR were no longer in service by then, and these are so noted.

<text>Sir Peter Reginald Frederick Hall (22 November 1930 11 September 2017) was an English theatre, opera and film director. His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; declared him &quot;the most important figure in British theatre for half a century&quot; and on his death, a Royal National Theatre statement declared that Hall&#x27;s &quot;influence on the artistic life of Britain in the 20th century was unparalleled&quot;. In 2018, the Laurence Olivier Awards, recognising achievements in London theatre, changed the award for Best Director to the Sir Peter Hall Award for Best Director.

In 1955, Hall introduced London audiences to the work of Samuel Beckett with the UK premiere of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;. Hall founded the Royal Shakespeare Company (1960–68) and went on to build an international reputation in theatre, opera, film and television. He was director of the National Theatre (1973–88) and artistic director of Glyndebourne Festival Opera (19841990). He formed the Peter Hall Company (19982011) and became founding director of the Rose Theatre Kingston in 2003. Throughout his career, he was a tenacious champion of public funding for the arts.

== Early life and career ==
Peter Reginald Frederick Hall was born in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, the only son of Grace Florence (née Pamment) and Reginald Edward Arthur Hall. His father was a stationmaster and the family lived for some time at Shelford railway station. He won a scholarship to The Perse School in Cambridge. Before taking up a further scholarship to read English at St. Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, Hall did his National Service in Germany at the RAF Headquarters for Education in Bückeburg. 

Whilst studying at Cambridge he produced and acted in a number of plays, directing five in his final year and a further three for The Marlowe Society Summer Festival. He served on the University Amateur Dramatic Club (ADC) committee before graduating in 1953. In the same year, Hall staged his first professional play, &quot;The Letter&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham, at The Theatre Royal Windsor. In 1954 and 1955, Hall was the director of the Oxford Playhouse, where he directed several later prominent young actors including Ronnie Barker and Billie Whitelaw. Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith were also part of the company as acting Assistants Stage Managers.

From 1955 to 1957, Hall ran the Arts Theatre in London, where he directed the English-language premiere of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; in 1955. The production&#x27;s success transformed his career overnight and attracted the attention of, among others, Tennessee Williams, for whom he would direct the London premieres of &quot;Camino Real&quot; (1957) and &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1958), and Harold Pinter. Other productions at The Arts included the English language premiere of &quot;The Waltz of the Toreadors&quot; by Jean Anouilh.

== Royal Shakespeare Company ==
Hall made his debut at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1956 with &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;: his productions there in the 19571959 seasons included &quot;Cymbeline&quot; with Peggy Ashcroft as Imogen, &quot;Coriolanus&quot; with Laurence Olivier, and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; with Charles Laughton. In 1960, aged 29, Hall succeeded Glen Byam Shaw as director of the theatre, and expanded operations to be all-year. He founded the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) to realise his vision of a resident ensemble of actors, directors and designers producing both modern and classic texts, with a distinctive house style. The company not only played in Stratford but expanded into the Aldwych Theatre, its first London home.

Hall&#x27;s many productions for the RSC included &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1965, with David Warner), &quot;The Government Inspector&quot; (1966, with Paul Scofield), the world premiere of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Homecoming&quot; (1965), and &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; (1963), adapted with John Barton from Shakespeare&#x27;s history plays. The latter was described as &quot;the greatest Shakespearian event in living memory which also laid down the doctrine of Shakespearian relevance to the modern world&quot;. Hall left the RSC in 1968 after almost ten years as its director.

==At the National Theatre==

Hall was appointed director of the National Theatre (NT) in 1973 and led the organisation for fifteen years until 1988. He supervised the move from the Old Vic to the new purpose-built complex on London&#x27;s South Bank &quot;in the face of wide-spread scepticism and violent union unrest, turning a potential catastrophe into the great success story it remains today.&quot; Frustrated by construction delays, Hall decided to move the company into the still-unfinished building and to open it theatre by theatre as each neared completion. Extracts from his production of &quot;Tamburlaine the Great&quot; with Albert Finney were performed out on the terraces, free to passers-by.

Hall directed thirty-three productions for the NT including the world premieres of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (1975, with John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson) and &quot;Betrayal&quot; (1978), Peter Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1979, with Paul Scofield and Simon Callow), and the London and Broadway premieres of Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s &quot;Bedroom Farce&quot;. Other landmark productions included &quot;The Oresteia&quot; (in a version by Tony Harrison with music by Harrison Birtwistle, 1981) which became the first Greek play to be performed by a foreign company at the ancient theatre of Epidaurus, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; (in his own adaptation, 1984) and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; with Judi Dench and Anthony Hopkins (1987).

Hall returned to the NT for the last time in 2011 with a production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; mounted by the company to celebrate his eightieth birthday. His daughter, Rebecca Hall, played Viola alongside Simon Callow as Sir Toby Belch in the Cottesloe Theatre.

== Later theatre career ==
Upon leaving the NT in 1988, Hall launched his own commercial company with productions in the West End and on Broadway of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot; (with Vanessa Redgrave) and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (with Dustin Hoffman). The Peter Hall Company went on to stage more than sixty plays in association with a number of producing partners including Bill Kenwright and Thelma Holt. In addition to an ensemble repertory season at the Old Vic (1997), the company enjoyed a long collaboration with the Theatre Royal, Bath where a series of summer festivals were staged from 20032011: many productions were subsequently performed on domestic and international tours and in the West End. The plays produced included Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1992), Pam Gems&#x27; &quot;Piaf&quot; (with Elaine Paige, 1993), &quot;Hamlet&quot; (with Stephen Dillane, 1994), Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Master Builder&quot; (with Alan Bates, 1995), &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (with Jessica Lange, 1996), Julian Barry&#x27;s &quot;Lenny&quot; (with Eddie Izzard, 1999), &quot;As You Like It&quot; (with Rebecca Hall and Dan Stevens, 2003), Brian Clark&#x27;s &quot;Whose Life is it Anyway?&quot; (with Kim Cattrall, 2005), the fiftieth anniversary production of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, Coward&#x27;s &quot;Hay Fever&quot; (with Judi Dench, 2006) and Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (with Tim Pigott-Smith and Michelle Dockery, 2007). Hall&#x27;s final productions for his company were &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot; (2011), staged at the Theatre Royal Bath.

Hall directed extensively in the United States including the world premiere of John Guare&#x27;s &quot;Four Baboons Adoring the Sun&quot; (Lincoln Center, 1992), three Shakespeare plays with Center Theater Group, Los Angeles (1999 and 2001) and John Barton&#x27;s nine-hour epic &quot;Tantalus&quot; (2000), an RSC co-production with the Denver Center for the Performing Arts.

In 2003, Hall became the founding director of The Rose Theatre a new venue to be constructed in Kingston upon Thames whose design was inspired by the Elizabethan original. He directed a number of productions there including Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, which opened the building in 2008, and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (with Judi Dench as Titania, 2010). Hall was also appointed &quot;Director Emeritus&quot; of The Rose Kingston.

== Opera ==
Peter Hall was also an internationally celebrated opera director. His first experience was in 1957, directing &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; by John Gardner at Sadler&#x27;s Wells. He was able to play the piano well enough to read opera scores. His first major project was Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Moses und Aron&quot; at Covent Garden, which led on to further productions at that house.
Hall worked at many of the world&#x27;s leading houses as well as Royal Opera House, including the Metropolitan Opera in New York, Houston Grand Opera, Los Angeles Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Bayreuth Festival where he, with conductor Georg Solti, directed Wagner&#x27;s Ring Cycle (&quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;) in 1983 to honour the centenary of the composer&#x27;s death. The production was played until 1986. Hall staged the world premieres of Michael Tippett&#x27;s &quot;The Knot Garden&quot; (1970) and &quot;New Year&quot; (1989). He had a close relationship with the Glyndebourne Festival where he was artistic director from 1984 to 1990, directing more than twenty productions including the Mozart/Da Ponte operas. His production of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1981) was revived nine times, most recently 35 years after its premiere, in August 2016. Hall also directed &quot;Albert Herring&quot; by Benjamin Britten, Cavalli&#x27;s &quot;La Calisto&quot;, Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria&quot; and Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; (all with Janet Baker); &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; and &quot;Carmen&quot; – both with his then wife, Maria Ewing, with whom he also staged a celebrated &quot;Salome&quot; (The Royal Opera London and L.A. Opera) in 1986. &quot;Opera magazine&quot; noted Hall&#x27;s characteristics as (in relation to &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; at Glyndebourne) &quot;dignity and emotional veracity&quot;, recalling that &quot;he would always insist that &#x27;the singers, like actors, played off each other&#x27;&quot;.

== Film and TV ==

Hall&#x27;s films for cinema and TV include &quot;Akenfield&quot; (1974), a fictionalisation based on Ronald Blythe&#x27;s oral history and filmed in Blythe&#x27;s native Suffolk with a cast of local people. It was restored and relaunched in 2016 by the BFI. Hall&#x27;s film &quot;She&#x27;s Been Away&quot; was written by Stephen Poliakoff and starred Peggy Ashcroft and Geraldine James who both won awards for their performances at the Venice Film Festival. Hall also directed &quot;The Camomile Lawn&quot; and &quot;The Final Passage&quot; for Channel 4 television, as well as a number of his opera and stage productions. His only American studio movie, the 1995 erotic thriller &quot;Never Talk to Strangers&quot;, &quot;proved to me that I have no aptitude whatever for surviving the Hollywood rat race,&quot; as Hall wrote in the updated edition of his memoir &quot;Making an Exhibition of Myself&quot;. For several years during the 1970s he presented the arts programme &quot;Aquarius&quot; for London Weekend Television. In 2005 he was the subject of a two-hour documentary for &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;, &quot;Peter Hall, Fifty Years in Theatre&quot;.

== Acting ==
Hall began acting as a student at Cambridge University, where Dadie Rylands taught him to speak Shakespearean verse. He was also influenced in his understanding of Shakespeare by the literary critic and teacher F. R. Leavis. He subsequently acted in three German films in the 1970s: &quot;Der Fußgänger&quot; (&quot;The Pedestrian&quot;, directed by Maximilian Schell, 1973), &quot;Als Mutter streikte&quot; (&quot;When Mother Went on Strike&quot;, 1974) and &quot;Der letzte Schrei&quot; (&quot;The Last Word&quot;, 1974).

== Books ==
His books on theatre include &quot;The Necessary Theatre&quot; (Nick Hern, 1999), &quot;Exposed by the Mask&quot; (Oberon, 2000) and &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Advice to the Players&quot; (Oberon, 2003). &quot;The Peter Hall Diaries the Story of a Dramatic Battle&quot;, edited by John Goodwin (Hamish Hamilton) were first published in 1983 and documented his struggle to establish the National Theatre on the South Bank. His autobiography, &quot;Making an Exhibition of Myself&quot; (Sinclair-Stevenson), was published in 1993.

== Awards ==
Peter Hall was appointed a CBE in 1963 and knighted in 1977 for his services to the theatre. He was awarded the Chevalier de L&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (1965), received the Shakespeare Prize (1967) and was elected Member of the Athens Academy for Services to Greek Drama (2004). His professional awards and nominations included two Tony Awards (&quot;The Homecoming&quot; and &quot;Amadeus&quot;) and four awards for lifetime achievement in the arts. In 2005 Hall was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame. He was Chancellor of Kingston University (20002013), held the Wortham Chair in Performing Arts at the University of Houston (19992002) and was awarded honorary doctorates from a number of universities including Cambridge, York, Liverpool, Bath and London.

== Personal life ==

Hall was married four times. He had six children and nine grandchildren. His first wife was French actress Leslie Caron, with whom he had a son, Christopher (b. 1957), and a daughter, Jennifer (b. 1958). With his second wife, Jacqueline Taylor, he had a son, Edward (b. 1966), and a daughter, Lucy (b. 1969). Hall married American opera singer Maria Ewing in 1982, with whom he had one daughter, Rebecca (b. 1982). He was lastly married to Nicki Frei; the couple had one daughter, Emma (b. 1992).

Hall worked with all his children: for the National Theatre, Jennifer played Miranda in &quot;The Tempest&quot; (1988); Rebecca, aged nine, played young Sophie in the Channel 4 adaptation of &quot;The Camomile Lawn&quot;, for The Peter Hall Company she played Vivie in &quot;Mrs Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot; (2002), Rosalind in &quot;As You Like It&quot; (2003), Maria in &quot;Gallileo&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2004) and, for the NT, Viola in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (2011); Emma, aged two, played Joseph in &quot;Jacob&quot; (2004, TV Movie); for the Peter Hall Company, Lucy designed &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1994), &quot;Cuckoos&quot; (2003) and &quot;Whose Life is it Anyway?&quot; (2005); Christopher produced the Channel 4 television drama &quot;The Final Passage&quot; (1996); Edward co-directed the stage epic &quot;Tantalus&quot; (2000).

Hall was diagnosed with dementia in 2011 and retired from public life.

Hall was described by &quot;Guardian&quot; contributor Mark Lawson as a &quot;committed atheist, from as early as his 20s&quot;, leading &quot;to a punishing work rate in his hurry to get everything done&quot;.

== Death and legacy ==
On 11 September 2017, Hall died from pneumonia at University College Hospital, London, surrounded by family. He was 86 years old.

His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; declared him &quot;the most important figure in British theatre for half a century&quot; and a Royal National Theatre statement declared that Hall&#x27;s &quot;influence on the artistic life of Britain in the 20th century was unparalleled&quot;.

Many luminaries of British theatre paid tribute to Hall. Nicholas Hytner said: &quot;Without him there would have been no Royal Shakespeare Company.&quot; Trevor Nunn said: &quot;Not only a thrilling director, he was the great impresario of the age.&quot; Richard Eyre called Hall the &quot;godfather&quot; of British theatre: &quot;Peter created the template of the modern director – part-magus, part-impresario, part-politician, part celebrity.&quot; Impresario Cameron Mackintosh said: &quot;It&#x27;s thanks to Peter Hall that people like Trevor Nunn, Nicholas Hytner and Sam Mendes transformed musical theatre around the world.&quot; Theatre critic Michael Coveney said that he believed Hall&#x27;s production of &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; &quot;recast the [Shakespeare] history plays and put them at the centre of our culture&quot;.

Peter Brook said: &quot;Peter was a man for all seasons – he could play any part that was needed&quot;. Elaine Paige said: &quot;Peter Hall had absolute authority and, as a heavyweight of the theatre, real presence.&quot; Griff Rhys Jones said: &quot;Peter was an absolute smoothie, the most charming and diplomatic man&quot; and Samuel West said &quot;Peter was an extraordinarily energetic, imaginative director – if you left him in the corner of a room he&#x27;d direct a play – but he was also a great campaigner. He never stopped arguing for the role of subsidised art in a civilised society and its ability to change people&#x27;s lives.&quot;

In April 2018, the Society of London Theatre, which presents the annual Laurence Olivier Awards recognizing achievements in London theatre, changed the award for Best Director to the Sir Peter Hall Award for Best Director.

<text>Ledges State Park is a state park in Boone County, Iowa, United States, located approximately south of the city of Boone. The park contains a sandstone gorge carved by Pea&#x27;s Creek, a tributary of the Des Moines River. The gorge is deep in places, with concretions jutting from the cliffs.

==Background==
The area was designated one of the first of Iowa&#x27;s state parks in 1924.

The lowland areas of the park are regularly flooded by the Des Moines River. In the 1970s, the state created a dam to form Saylorville Lake on the Des Moines River. This action has resulted in repeated flooding of low-lying areas of the park for decades. A group called The Iowa Citizens to Save Ledges State Park was organized in 1972 in protest of the proposed Saylorville Dam. Its primary objective was to alleviate and/or minimize the harmful effects on Ledges State Park by the Saylorville Lake Project of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. There were numerous conservation groups affiliated with the group, including the Ames Reservoir Environmental Study, the Iowa Conservation Commission, and the Iowa Wildlife Society.

The repeated flooding has radically changed the appearance of the lower Ledges—the timbered areas have been greatly reduced, are often covered with silt.. This is quite a change from the time when Farwell Brown and his fellow Boy Scouts camped in the Ledges in the 1920s among the lush growth in the lower Ledges. Camping and picnicking in the lower Ledges were popular recreations until the frequent floods made that area of the park less desirable. Many of the picnic areas and picnic houses in the park&#x27;s flood plain have been decommissioned in the past decade. Annual flooding has made maintenance of the buildings cost prohibitive and seemingly pointless.

The park includes numerous stone buildings and bridges constructed in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Also included in the facilities are numerous campsites, picnic tables, and stone shelters, many of which have been destroyed in three decades of regular flooding.

Although extensive flooding to the lowermost portions of Ledges does occur in floods such as in 1993 and 2008, even the largest floods on record only submerge a small portion of the park. The canyon road, a winding one lane path traverses through Pea&#x27;s and Davis creeks at five points and offers views of sandstone walls buttressing bluffs, which were created by glacial melt through sandstone deposited under an inland sea millions of years ago. Evidence of the hard work of the Civilian Conservation Corps is seen in the miles of railroad-tied trails leading up to vistas overlooking the Des Moines River Valley and the canyon. The Sioux, Fox and Sauk tribes were all once residents of the Ledges State Park area and have numerous burial mounds in the area, and wildlife such as white-tailed deer, raccoon, beaver, woodchuck and many varieties of birds such as the pileated woodpecker call the park home.

There is a flood pole located in the lowlands of the park which has recorded the various flood levels over the years.

==Geology==
The sandstone of the cliffs was the remnant of the prehistoric sea that covered the Midwest approximately 300 million years ago. The cliffs themselves are the result of recent glaciation during the last ice age approximately 13,000 years ago, when meltwater carved quickly down through the rock.

==Recreation==
Many hiking trails are located throughout the Ledges. Woodlands are located in the park containing mainly basswood, maple, oak, and hickory trees. Prairie and clearings are also located throughout the park. Canoeing and fishing is made possible as the Des Moines River runs along the west side of the park.

Rustic or modern campsites are available. 75% of campsites are reservable but 25% of sites are first come first serve.

<doc id="461791" wikidata="Q219466" url="?curid=461791" title="Wudu">
<text>Wuduʾ ( ) is the Islamic procedure for cleansing parts of the body, a type of ritual purification, or ablution. The steps of wudu are washing the hands, rinsing the mouth and nose, washing the face, then the forearms, then wiping the head, the ears, then washing or wiping the feet, while doing them in order without any big breaks between them.

Wudu is an important part of ritual purity in Islam that is governed by fiqh, which specifies hygienical jurisprudence and defines the rituals that constitute it. Ritual purity is called &quot;tahara&quot;.

Wudu is typically performed before Salah or reading the Quran. Activities that invalidate wudu include urination, defecation, flatulence, deep sleep, light bleeding (depending on madhhab), menstruation, postpartum status, and sexual intercourse.

Wudu is often translated as &quot;partial ablution&quot;, as opposed to ghusl, which translates to &quot;&quot;full ablution&quot;,&quot; where the whole body is washed. An alternative to wudu is tayammum or &quot;dry ablution&quot;, which uses clean sand in place of water due to complete water scarcity or if one is suffering from moisture-induced skin inflammation or illness or other harmful effects on the person.

== Description of Wudu ==

===Quran===
Qur&#x27;an 2:222 says 

Qur&#x27;an 5:6 says 

===Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence)===
Wudu by itself is mustahabb, a recommended act (), but it becomes obligatory in special conditions such as prayer, reading the Quran, tawaf, etc.

=== Description in Hadith ===
Wudu, in a hadith of Abu Hurairah discussing the Day of Resurrection, said that Muhammad, when asked if he would be able to recognize Muslims, said, &quot;Yes, you would have a mark which other people will not have. You would come to me with a white blaze on your foreheads and white marks on your feet because of the traces of ablution.&quot;

Muhammad said that &quot;Cleanliness is half of faith.&quot;

Abu Hurairah said, &quot;I have heard the prophet (may peace be upon him) say, &#x27;In a believer, adornment would reach the places where ablution reaches.&#x27;&quot;

Uthman stated that Muhammad said, &quot;He who performed ablution well, his sins would come out from his body, even coming out from under his nails.&quot;

Umar reported that Muhammad said, &quot;No one among you does wuḍūʾ and does wuḍūʾ thoroughly – or adequately – and then testifies, &#x27;There is no god but Allah Alone with no partner and I testify that Muhammad is Allah&#x27;s Messenger&#x27;, without the eight doors of the Garden being opened to him so that he can enter by whichever of them he wishes.&quot;

==Wudu requirements==

===Types of water===
;Permitted
The water of Wudu must be &quot;muṭlaq&quot;, meaning pure or unmixed (not necessarily chemically pure). The name of a liquid that is normally regarded by individuals as water.
* Melted snow or hail
* Water of ocean, lakes or ponds.
* Well water 
* Fountain water
* Tap water

;Prohibited
* Green water (green water usually means dirty water)
* Water made from any trees or fruits
* Water which contains urine, blood, or stool, or has been touched by a live or a dead animal
* Used water of wuḍūʾ or ghusl according to the Hanbali school

Other acts performed during wuḍūʾ and the detailed acts of the wuḍūʾ can be classed into three types:

===Farā&#x27;id according to Sunni Muslims===
The obligation of the following actions is debated among the schools of fiqh, though if not deemed obligatory they are considered recommended:
* Intention, i.e. resolving in the heart that one is performing wudu as an act of worship rather than an ordinary cleaning activity. This is obligatory in the Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali schools.
* Performing wudu in consecutive actions, i.e. there should not be prolonged pauses during the ritual. This is considered obligatory in the Maliki and Hanbali schools.
* Performing the actions of wudu in order, i.e. washing the face then arms then wiping the head and finally washing the feet. This is obligatory in the Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali schools.
*Wiping the ears. This is mandatory in the Hanbali school.
* Rubbing the washed organs while washing. This is obligatory in the Maliki school.
* Rinsing the mouth and nose during wudu. This is obligatory in the Hanbali school.
* Saying the basmala at the beginning of wudu. This is obligatory in the Hanbali school.
It is not sufficient for one to pass wet hand over the feet. Under certain conditions, it can be done over slippers or traditional leather footwear called &quot;khuffayn&quot;.

=== Farā&#x27;id according to Shia Muslims ===


Shi&#x27;a Muslims also believe the Qur&#x27;anic mandate for wuḍūʾ comes in the sixth ayat of al-Ma&#x27;idah. The āyah has been translated by Muhammad Habib Shakir.

* Washing the face once or twice with your right hand.
* Washing both arms, including the elbows, once or twice (the left hand washes the right arm and then right-hand washes the left arm).
* Wiping a fourth of the head with the water left on your right hand.
* Wiping both feet once with the water remaining on both hands (right hand, right foot; left hand, left foot).

===Mustahabbāt (recommended acts)===
There are a handful of recommended acts, but if omitted, the wuḍūʾ is still valid.
* Reciting the shahada after the ablution.
* During wudu, one should not engage in worldly talk.
* Choosing a clean place for ablution.
* Not wasting water in ablution.
* Starting from the right side and then the left.
* Doing any dhikr, such as istighfar.

==Performance==

=== Wudu in Sunnism ===
Sunni Muslims generally perform the following:
# Make intention to perform wudu.
# Recite the &quot;basmala&quot;.
# Wash both hands up to the wrist (and between the fingers) up to three times, starting with the right hand first.
# Gargle water in their mouth and spit out the water (three times).
# Some water should be taken in the right hand and sniffed into the nostrils thrice and then blown out.
# Wash the entirety of the face (from the hairline to the chin and be sure to run your fingers through your beard, if the person has one) If any strands of hair fall over the face, they are not moved aside as it is sunnah to dap the wet hands over the strands. 
# Wash the entire right forearm, including the hand, up to and including the elbow (up to three times); then the left arm (up to three times). Pass fingers of one hand between the fingers of the other hand to ensure no part is left dry. Rings and bracelets should be removed to ensure no part of the hands are dry and this applies to certain kinds of earrings as well.
# Perform masah of head. Wet hands should be passed all over and through the hair to the ends of the hair. One may not make masah over a Muslim head cap.
# Then (without washing the hands) the index fingers of the right and left hands should be used to clean the bends of the right and left ears (simultaneously) and in the same operation, the thumbs should be used to clean the back of the ears. 
# Both feet starting from the right are washed from the toes up to and including the ankles three times

* After wudu, it is recommended to recite the &quot;shahadah:&quot; 
|source=Sunan an-Nasa&#x27;i 148, Sahih Muslim 234b}}
* Then one may recite this Dua: 
Any part of the body that has not been washed, cleaned or dried improperly can be redone.

== Invalidation ==


Theoretically, one can perform one wuḍūʾ for Salah and this wudu would be considered valid for the rest of the day, unless you nullify it by certain means. Muslims believe that certain acts invalidate the wudu (often referred to as &#x27;breaking wudu&#x27; and &#x27;losing wudu&#x27;), although the Qur&#x27;an does not explain most of these, and rules differ among schools. 
=== According to Sunni Muslims ===
According to Sunni Islam, the following invalidates wudu:
* Slow-wave sleep while reclining.
* Sleeping with the help of support.
* Loss of senses.
* Fainting.
* Defecation or urination.
* Odorous or audible emissions of flatulence.
* Ejaculation of semen.
* Vomiting.
* Touching the private parts with the bare hands.
* Blood or pus leaving the body so that it leaves the point of exit.

=== According to Shia Muslims ===
According to Shia theology, the following invalidate wudu:
* Defecation or urination.
* Odorous or audible emissions of flatulence.
* Ejaculation of semen.
* When someone falls into a deep sleep in which they have no alert consciousness.
* anything that causes loss of one&#x27;s consciousness such as craze, drunkenness, or anesthesia.
* anything that needs Ghusl such as being &quot;Junub&quot; or touching a corpse under special circumstances.

Belching and vomiting do not invalidate wudhu; however, it is strongly recommended that the individual rinse his or her mouth following the latter. Bleeding is not considered to invalidate wudhu either, as Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq made it clear in Hadith that a bad wound is not caused to repeat wudhu. This concept further extends to parasites that may exit the body through the two extremities. Cutting one&#x27;s hair or nails does not invalidate wudhu but he or she should wipe the area with water.

== Alternatives ==
Muslims who are unable to perform the prevailing form of ablution due to skin disease, a disability, or a lack of clean water, etc. are recommended to perform tayammum, sometimes called &#x27;dry ablution&#x27;, using sand or dust instead of water. Such ritual purity may also be accepted in cases in weather where it would be dangerous.

Tayammum is also to be performed when one is defiled and could not perform ghusl.

<doc id="461795" wikidata="Q566356" url="?curid=461795" title="Fort Stanwix">
<text>Fort Stanwix was a colonial fort whose construction commenced on August 26, 1758, under the direction of British General John Stanwix, at the location of present-day Rome, New York, but was not completed until about 1762. The bastion fort was built to guard a portage known as the Oneida Carry during the French and Indian War. Fort Stanwix National Monument, a reconstructed structure built by the National Park Service, now occupies the site.

Fort Stanwix is historically significant because of its successful defense by American troops during an August 1777 siege. The fort had been built by the British in 1758 at a strategic site along the water route from Lake Ontario to the Hudson River. After American forces captured and rebuilt the fort during the American Revolutionary War, they were besieged by a British army that invaded from Canada via Lake Ontario, hoping to reach the Hudson River. The British force abandoned the siege, a consequence that helped lead to the defeat of a larger British army during the Saratoga campaign.

Fort Stanwix was also the site of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix between Britain and Native American tribes, as well as of the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix between the tribes and the American government.

Besides the fort reconstruction itself, the national monument includes three short trails that encircle it, one of which follows a portion of the Oneida Carry. The Marinus Willett Collections Management and Education Center preserves the monument&#x27;s 485,000 artifacts and documents, displays exhibits about Fort Stanwix and the Mohawk Valley, and serves as a regional tourism center.

==History==
Fort Stanwix was constructed in 1758 to guard a portage, the Oneida Carry, between the main waterway southeastward to the Atlantic seacoast, down the Mohawk and Hudson rivers, and an important interior waterway northwestward to Lake Ontario, down Wood Creek and Oneida Lake to Oswego.

===Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768)===
In 1768, Fort Stanwix was the site of an important treaty conference between the British and the Iroquois, arranged by William Johnson. By the time of this treaty, the fort had become dilapidated and inactive. The purpose of the conference was to renegotiate the boundary line between Native American lands and white settlements set forth in the Proclamation of 1763. The British government hoped a new boundary line might bring an end to the rampant frontier violence, which had become costly and troublesome. Native Americans hoped a new, permanent line might hold back white colonial expansion.

The final treaty was signed on November 5 and extended the earlier proclamation much further west. The Iroquois had effectively ceded Kentucky to the whites. However, the tribes who actually used the Kentucky lands, primarily Shawnee, Delaware, and Cherokee, had no role in the negotiations. Rather than secure peace, the Fort Stanwix treaty helped set the stage for the next round of hostilities.

Fort Stanwix was abandoned in 1768 and allowed to go to ruin.

===Fort Schuyler and the Battle of Oriskany===

The fort was reoccupied by Colonial troops under the command of Colonel Elias Dayton on July 12, 1776. They began reconstruction and renamed it Fort Schuyler, although many continued to call it Fort Stanwix. Colonel Peter Gansevoort took over command of the fort on May 3, 1777.

On August 3, 1777, the fort was besieged by The King&#x27;s 8th Regiment of Foot, Loyalists, and Native Americans, under the command of Brigadier General Barry St. Leger, as part of a three-pronged campaign to divide the American colonies. Gansevoort refused the terms of surrender offered by the British, and the siege commenced.

According to local folklore, when the Colonial troops raised the flag over the fort on August 3, 1777, it was the first time that the Flag of the United States was flown in battle. It is more likely that the flag flown at Fort Schuyler was one that consisted only of thirteen stripes, an early version of the Flag of New York, or the Grand Union Flag.

The Battle of Oriskany was fought a few miles away when an American relief column, led by General Nicholas Herkimer, was ambushed by Tories and their Native American allies. While many of the besiegers were attending to that battle, the defenders of the fort sallied forth and attacked the enemy camp, looting and destroying enemy stores. Demoralized and reduced in strength, the British withdrew when they heard reports of the approach of yet another relief column, led by General Benedict Arnold. The British forces withdrew through Canada and joined Burgoyne&#x27;s campaign at Fort Ticonderoga.

The British failure to capture the fort and proceed down the Mohawk Valley was a severe setback and helped lead to the defeat of General John Burgoyne at the Battle of Saratoga.

In April 1779, an expedition from Fort Schuyler against the Onondaga people was begun by the Continental Army led by Col. Goose Van Schaick.

The fort burned to the ground on May 13, 1781, and was not rebuilt. It was abandoned and the garrison took up quarters at Fort Herkimer.

===Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)===

The second Treaty of Fort Stanwix was conducted at the fort between the Americans and the Native Americans in 1784. During the War of 1812 a blockhouse was built on the parade ground. Beginning in 1828 the fortifications were dismantled.

== National monument ==

President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed enabling legislation that created the national monument on August 21, 1935; at that time, the land that would ultimately be used for the monument was occupied by the businesses and residences of downtown Rome. During the 1960s, Rome city leaders lobbied for a fort reconstruction as part of an urban renewal program to help revitalize downtown Rome. Under political pressure from Senator Robert F. Kennedy (D-NY), who was seeking political support in upstate New York, the Park Service reluctantly agreed to build a reconstruction of the Revolutionary War-era fort.

The Park Service completed a master plan for Fort Stanwix in 1967, and in 1970, the NPS began a three-year archaeological investigation. Reconstruction of the fort began in 1974, and the partially completed structure was opened to the public in time for the United States Bicentennial celebration in 1976. The current reconstruction—an earth-and-timber-clad, reinforced concrete structure surrounding three freestanding buildings—was completed in 1978.

From 1976 until the mid-1990s, the national monument explained the significance of the national monument to visitors using first-person interpretation to portray the fort immediately after the siege (1777–78), emphasizing life during the American Revolution. More recently, third-person interpretation has extended visitor understanding to the French and Indian War as well as the role played by the fort during the negotiation of a series of treaties with Native Americans. A new visitor center was added in 2005. The monument is currently open year around, operated by the National Park Service.

<doc id="461800" wikidata="Q202517" url="?curid=461800" title="Wisdom tooth">
<text>The third molar, commonly called wisdom tooth, is the most posterior of the three molars in each quadrant of the human dentition. The age at which wisdom teeth come through (erupt) is variable, but this generally occurs between late teens and early twenties. Most adults have four wisdom teeth, one in each of the four quadrants, but it is possible to have none, fewer, or more, in which case the extras are called supernumerary teeth. Wisdom teeth may become stuck (impacted) and not erupt fully, if there is not enough space for them to come through normally. Impacted wisdom teeth are still sometimes removed for orthodontic treatment, believing that they move the other teeth and cause crowding, though this is no longer held as true.

Impacted wisdom teeth may suffer from tooth decay if oral hygiene becomes more difficult. Wisdom teeth which are partially erupted through the gum may also cause inflammation and infection in the surrounding gum tissues, termed pericoronitis. More conservative treatments, such as operculectomies, may be appropriate for some cases. However, impacted wisdom teeth are commonly extracted to treat or prevent these problems. Some sources oppose the prophylactic removal of disease-free impacted wisdom teeth, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK.

==History==
Although formally known as third molars, the common name is wisdom teeth because they appear so late – much later than the other teeth, at an age where people are presumably &quot;wiser&quot; than as a child, when the other teeth erupt. The term probably came as a translation of the Latin &quot;dens sapientiae&quot;. Their eruption has been known to cause dental issues for millennia; it was noted at least as far back as Aristotle:

The oldest known impacted wisdom tooth belonged to a European woman who lived between 13,000 and 11,000 BCE, in the Magdalenian period. Nonetheless, molar impaction was relatively rare prior to the modern era. With the Industrial Revolution, the affliction became ten times more common, owing to the new prevalence of soft, processed foods.

== Structure ==

=== Tooth morphology ===
Morphology of wisdom teeth can be variable.

Maxillary (upper) third molars commonly have a triangular crown with a deep central fossa from which multiple irregular fissures originate. Their roots are commonly fused together and can be irregular in shape.

Mandibular (lower) third molars are the smallest molar teeth in the permanent dentition. The crown usually takes on a rounded rectangular shape that features four or five cusps with an irregular fissure pattern. Roots are greatly reduced in size and can be fused together.

=== Dental notation ===
There are several notation systems used in dentistry to identify teeth.  Under the Palmer/Zsigmondy system, the right and left maxillary wisdom teeth are represented by 8⏌ and ⎿8, while 8⏋ and ⎾8 represent the right and left mandibular wisdom teeth. Under the FDI notational system, the right and left maxillary third molars are numbered 18 and 28, respectively, and the right and left mandibular third molars are numbered 48 and 38. According to the Universal Numbering System the right and left upper wisdom teeth are numbered 1 and 16 and the right and left lower wisdom teeth are 17 and 32.

=== Variation ===
Agenesis of wisdom teeth differs by population, ranging from practically zero in Aboriginal Tasmanians to nearly 100% in indigenous Mexicans. The difference is related to the PAX9 and MSX1 genes (and perhaps other genes).

===Age of eruption===
There is significant variation between the reported age of eruption of wisdom teeth between different populations. For example, wisdom teeth tend to erupt earlier in people with African heritage compared to people of Asian and European heritage.

Generally wisdom teeth erupt most commonly between age 17 and 21. Eruption may start as early as age 13 in some groups and typically occurs before the age of 25. If they have not erupted by age 25, oral surgeons generally consider that the tooth will not erupt spontaneously.

Root development can continue for up to three years after eruption occurs.

== Function ==
Anthropologists believe human and primate wisdom teeth may help with chewing tougher foods. After the advent of agriculture over 10,000 years ago, and especially with the industrial revolution in recent centuries, soft human diets became more common through the use of tools (cutting the food) and cooking to make food easier to chew. Compared to hunter-gatherer populations, post-industrial agriculturalist populations are thought to encounter less masticatory stress and consequently have shorter and wider mandibles, predisposing them to dental crowding and malocclusion.

==Clinical significance==
Wisdom teeth (often notated clinically as M3 for third molar) have long been identified as a source of problems and continue to be the most commonly impacted teeth in the human mouth. Impaction of the wisdom teeth results in a risk of periodontal disease and dental cavities. Impacted wisdom teeth lead to pathology in 12% of cases. 
Impacted wisdom teeth are classified by the direction and depth of impaction, the amount of available space for tooth eruption and the amount of soft tissue or bone that covers them. The classification structure allows clinicians to estimate the probabilities of impaction, infections and complications associated with wisdom teeth removal. Wisdom teeth are also classified by the presence of symptoms and disease.

Treatment of an erupted wisdom tooth is the same as any other tooth in the mouth. If impacted and having a pathology, such as caries or pericoronitis, treatment can be dental restoration for cavities and for pericoronitis, salt water rinses, local treatment to the infected tissue overlying the impaction, oral antibiotics, surgical removal of excess gum flap (operculectomy), or if those failed, extraction or coronectomy.

The National Health Service in the UK recommends people go to dental check-ups every 3–24 months, depending on the state of the teeth and gums and the recommendation of the dentist.

=== Common pathologies associated with wisdom teeth ===
Odontogenic infections are a dental complication originating inside the tooth or in close proximity to the surrounding tissues. There are different types of odontogenic infections which may affect impacted wisdom teeth such as periodontitis, pulpitis, dental abscess and pericoronitis.

Pericoronitis is a common pathology of impacted third molar. It is an acute localized infection of the tissue surrounding the impacted wisdom teeth. Clinically the tissue appears to be red, tender to touch and edematous. The common symptoms the patient’s report are pain ‘that ranges from dull to throbbing to intense’ and often radiates to mouth, ear or floor of the mouth. Moreover, swelling of the cheek, halitosis and trismus can occur.

=== Odontogenic cysts ===
Odontogenic cysts are a less common pathology of the impacted wisdom tooth with some estimates of prevalence from 0.64% to 2.24% of impacted wisdom teeth. They are described as ‘cavities filled with liquid, semiliquid or gaseous content with odontogenic epithelial lining and connective tissue on the outside’. However, studies have found cysts to be prevalent in a small percentage of impacted wisdom teeth that are extracted. The most common types associated with impacted third molars are radicular cysts, dentigerous cysts and odontogenic keratocysts. Large cysts take 2–13 years to develop.

=== Oral hygiene care ===
Practice and maintenance of good oral hygiene can help prevent and control some wisdom tooth pathologies. In addition to twice daily toothbrushing, interdental cleaning is recommended to ensure plaque build doesn’t occur in interdental areas. There are various products available for this – dental floss and interdental brushes being the most common.

=== Removal of impacted wisdom teeth ===
Removal of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth with the absence of disease and no evidence of local infection as a prophylactic method has been disputed within the dental community for a long time. There is insufficient reliable scientific evidence for dental health professionals and policy makers to determine if asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth should be removed. Therefore, the decision will depend on a combination of clinical expertise and patient preference. If the tooth is retained, regular check-ups to identify any problems that may occur is recommended. Considering the lack of quality evidence at present, more long-term studies need to be undertaken to obtain a reliable scientific conclusion.

=== Mandibular third molar surgery recovery ===
Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is a postoperative method used to heal the alveolar socket following the removal of the mandibular third molar. PRF is a second generation result of the isolation of platelets, white blood cells, stem cells and growth factors from blood samples. Studies have shown that when used there are improvements in pain sensations, swelling and a decreased risk of developing dry socket. This method was shown to only reduce symptoms and is not completely preventive. To date there is no clear correlation between the use of PRF after a mandibular third molar removal surgery and the recovery of jaw spasms, bone restoration and soft tissue healing. Further studies with larger study samples are needed to validate current theories.

=== Prognosis ===
About a third of symptomatic unerupted wisdom teeth have been shown to partially erupt and be non-functional or non-hygienic. Studies have also shown that 30% to 60% of people with previously asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth will have an extraction of at least one of them in 4 to 12 years from diagnosis.

=== Risk factors of inferior alveolar nerve damage ===
Temporary and permanent inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) damage is a known complication of the surgical removal of impacted lower third molars, happening in 1 in 85 patients and 1 in 300 extractions, respectively. Studies have shown that certain risk factors may increase the likelihood of IAN damage. Proximity of the impacted third molar root to the mandibular canal, which can be seen in radiographs, has been shown to be a high-risk factor for IAN damage. Alongside this, the depth of impaction of the tooth, surgical technique and surgeons experience are all contributing risk factors for IAN damage during this procedure. Careful case-by-case consideration is crucial to avoid this risk.

=== Lower anterior teeth crowding ===
Lower anterior teeth crowding has been a common discussion among the orthodontic community for decades. In the 1970s it was thought that unerupted wisdom teeth produced a forward directed force which would cause crowding of the anterior segment. Recent research has shown that there is no agreed opinion and that the cause is due to a variety of factors. This includes dental factors such as tooth crown size and primary tooth loss. Skeletal factors which include growth of the maxilla and mandible and the presence of malocclusions. General factors include the age and gender of the patient. Overall, recent research has suggested that wisdom teeth alone do not cause crowding of teeth.

<text>Dorothy Snowden &quot;Dar&quot; Williams (born April 19, 1967) is an American pop folk singer-songwriter from Mount Kisco, New York. Hendrik Hertzberg of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; has described Williams as &quot;one of America&#x27;s very best singer-songwriters.&quot;

She is a frequent performer at folk festivals and has toured with such artists as Mary Chapin Carpenter, Patty Griffin, Ani DiFranco, the Nields, Shawn Colvin, Girlyman, Joan Baez, and Catie Curtis.

==Early life and education==

Williams was born in Mount Kisco, New York, and grew up in Chappaqua with two older sisters, Meredith and Julie. Her nickname &quot;Dar&quot; originated due to a mispronunciation of &quot;Dorothy&quot; by one of Williams&#x27;s sisters. In a 2008 interview with WUKY radio, Dar said her parents wanted to name her Darcy, after the character in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, and that they intentionally called her &quot;Dar-Dar&quot;, which she shortened to &quot;Dar&quot; in school.

In interviews, she has described her parents as &quot;liberal and loving&quot; people who early on encouraged a career in songwriting. Williams began playing the guitar at age nine and wrote her first song two years later. However, she was more interested in drama at the time, and majored in theater and religion at Wesleyan University.

== Career ==

Williams moved to Boston in 1990 to further explore a career in theater. She worked for a year as stage manager of the Opera Company of Boston, but on the side began to write songs, record demo tapes, and take voice lessons. In 1990, Dar recorded her first album, &quot;I Have No History&quot;, produced by Jeannie Deva and engineered by Rob Lehmann at Oak Grove Studios in Malden, Massachusetts. One year later in 1991, Dar recorded her second album, &quot;All My Heroes Are Dead&quot;, most of which was recorded at Wellspring Sound in Newton, MA. This album included Dar&#x27;s song &quot;Mark Rothko Song.&quot; The original recording of this song was later included in her third album &quot;The Honesty Room&quot;. In 1993 Williams moved to Northampton, Massachusetts. Early in Williams&#x27;s music career, she opened for Joan Baez, who would make her relatively well known by recording some of her songs (Williams also dueted with Baez on &quot;Ring Them Bells&quot;). Her growing popularity has since relied heavily on community coffeehouses, public radio, and an extensive fan base on the Internet.

Williams recorded her first full album, &quot;The Honesty Room,&quot; under her own label, Burning Field Music. Guest artists included Nerissa and Katryna Nields, Max Cohen and Gideon Freudmann. The album was briefly distributed by Chicago-based Waterbug Records. Williams soon secured a licensing-and-distribution deal for Burning Field with Razor and Tie, and in 1995 reissued the album on that label, with two re-recorded bonus tracks. The record went on to become one of the top-selling independent folk albums of the year. 1996&#x27;s &quot;Mortal City&quot;, also licensed and distributed with Razor and Tie, received substantial notice, partially due to the fact that it coincided with her tour with Baez. The album again featured guest appearances by the Nields sisters and Freudmann, as well as noted folk artists John Prine, Cliff Eberhardt and Lucy Kaplansky. With that success, Razor &amp; Tie re-released &quot;The Honesty Room&quot;. By the time of her third release, &quot;End of The Summer&quot; (1997), Williams&#x27;s career had gathered substantial momentum, and the album did remarkably well, given its genre and independent label status.

In 1998, Williams, Richard Shindell and Lucy Kaplansky formed the group Cry Cry Cry as a way to pay homage to some of their favorite folk artists. The band released an eponymous album of covers and toured from 1998 to 2000. In June 2017, Cry Cry Cry reunited for the first time to play at the Clearwater Festival in New York.

She has since released six more studio albums on the Razor &amp; Tie label (&quot;The Green World&quot; (2000; which included &quot;Spring Street&quot;, based on Spring Street in SoHo in Manhattan), &quot;The Beauty of the Rain&quot; (2003), &quot;My Better Self&quot; (2005), &quot;Promised Land&quot; (2008), &quot;Many Great Companions&quot; (2010), and &quot;In the Time of Gods&quot; (2012), as well as two live albums (&quot;Out There Live&quot; (2001) and &quot;Live at Bearsville Theater&quot; (2007)).

Williams founded the Snowden Environmental Trust and has been a part of many benefit concerts. She performed in a show at Alcatraz with Baez and the Indigo Girls, to benefit the prisoner-rights group Bread and Roses.

As someone who has toured a great deal of the time and had trouble finding suitable dining on the road, Williams was inspired to write and publish a directory of natural food stores and restaurants called &quot;The Tofu Tollbooth&quot; in 1994. In 1998 Williams co-authored a second edition with Elizabeth Zipern.

Williams wrote a book, released on September 5, 2017, titled &quot;What I Found in a Thousand Towns: A Traveling Musicians Guide to Rebuilding America&#x27;s Communities – One Coffee Shop, Dog Run, &amp; Open-Mike Night at a Time&quot;, that focuses in part on rebuilding smaller cities and larger towns in America.

==Personal life==

On May 4, 2002, she married Michael Robinson, an old friend from college, though they are now divorced. Their son, Stephen Gray Robinson, was born on April 24, 2004. In addition, they have an adopted daughter named Taya, who was born in Ethiopia. She resides in the Hudson Valley region of New York.

==Songs==

Recurrent themes in Williams&#x27;s songs include religion, adolescence, gender issues, anti-commercialism, misunderstood relationships, loss, humor, and geography.

Williams&#x27; early work spoke clearly of her upbringing in 1970s and 80s suburbia – of alienation, and the hypocrisy evident in the post-WWII middle class. On the track &quot;Anthem&quot; on her early tape &quot;All My Heroes Are Dead&quot;, she sang, &quot;I know there&#x27;s blood in the pavement and we&#x27;ve turned the fields to sand.&quot;

Williams&#x27; songs often address gender typing, roles, and inequities. &quot;You&#x27;re Aging Well&quot; on &quot;The Honesty Room&quot; discusses adolescent body image, ageism and self-loathing in detail. The song ends with the singer finding an unnamed female mentor — &quot;the woman of voices&quot; — who points her toward a more enlightened and mature point of view. Joan Baez covered the song in concert and later dueted with Williams on tours.

A 2001 article in &quot;The Advocate&quot; discussed Williams&#x27; popularity among LGBT people, writing that among LGBT-supportive straight songwriters, &quot;few manage in their lyrics to dig as deeply or as authentically as... Williams does&quot;.

&quot;When I Was a Boy&quot;, also on &quot;The Honesty Room&quot;, uses Williams&#x27; own childhood experiences as a tomboy to muse on gender roles and how they limit boys and girls, who then become limited men and women.

&quot;The Christians and the Pagans&quot; on &quot;Mortal City&quot; simultaneously tackles both religion and sexual orientation through a tale of a lesbian, pagan couple that chooses to spend solstice with the devout Christian uncle of one of the women, thus creating a situation where people who would oppose each other on almost every political and cultural front try to get by on pure politeness. Throughout the song, the family members begin to discover their differences need not estrange them from one another.

In an interview in 2007 on the Food Is Not Love podcast, she said that the song &quot;February&quot; from &quot;Mortal City&quot; is one of her songs that she likes best. She referred to the way the song &quot;kept on evolving into, not only what I wanted to say, but what I wanted to say and didn&#x27;t even know was in there.&quot; She liked the way the song &quot;kept on breaking its own rules in a way that art is all about.&quot;

Williams&#x27; relationship with her family is hinted at through several songs, including &quot;After All&quot; on &quot;The Green World&quot;. The song deals mainly with her depression at the age of twenty-one, referring to it as a &quot;winter machine that you go through&quot; repeatedly while &quot;everyone else is spring-bound.&quot;

Her song &quot;As Cool As I Am&quot; has become part of Bryn Mawr College&#x27;s traditional May Day, when the song is played during the &quot;May Hole&quot; celebration. The song is even called an &quot;unofficial anthem&quot; for the school. Williams has visited the college several times to perform at concerts.

<text>Tanacetum is a genus of about 160 species of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae, native to many regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are known commonly as tansies. The name tansy can refer specifically to &quot;Tanacetum vulgare&quot;, which may be called the common tansy or garden tansy for clarity. The generic name &quot;Tanacetum&quot; means &#x27;immortality&#x27; in Botanical Latin, since tansy was once placed between the burial sheets of the dead to repel vermin.

Other familiar species include costmary (&quot;T. balsamita&quot;) and feverfew (&quot;T. parthenium&quot;).

Tansies are mainly perennial herbs, but some are annuals and subshrubs. Some are a few centimeters tall and some reach . They vary in form, with one or more branching stems growing erect or prostrate, usually from rhizomes. They are hairy to hairless in texture, and most are aromatic. The leaves are alternately arranged, the blades sometimes borne on petioles. They are usually deeply lobed and may have toothed edges. Most species have flowers in loose or dense inflorescences. The flower has layers of distinct phyllaries around its base and may be flat to hemispheric in shape. The flower has many yellow disc florets, sometimes over 300. Some species have ray florets in shades of yellow, or white with yellowish bases. Some species lack true ray florets but have flat yellowish disc florets that look like rays. The fruit is a ribbed, glandular cypsela, usually with a pappus on the end.

<doc id="461806" wikidata="Q319605" url="?curid=461806" title="Tvrtko I of Bosnia">
<text>Stephen Tvrtko I (; 1338 – 10 March 1391) was the first king of Bosnia. A member of the House of Kotromanić, he succeeded his uncle Stephen II as the ban of Bosnia in 1353. As he was a minor at the time, Tvrtko&#x27;s father, Vladislav, briefly ruled as regent, followed by Tvrtko&#x27;s mother, Jelena. Early in his personal rule, Tvrtko quarrelled with his country&#x27;s Roman Catholic clergy but later enjoyed cordial relations with all the religious communities in his realm. After initial difficulties—the loss of large parts of Bosnia to his overlord, King Louis I of Hungary, and being briefly deposed by his magnates—Tvrtko&#x27;s power grew considerably. He conquered some remnants of the neighbouring Serbian Empire in 1373, after the death of its last ruler and his distant relative, Uroš the Weak. In 1377, he had himself crowned king of Bosnia and Serbia, claiming to be the heir of Serbia&#x27;s extinct Nemanjić dynasty.

As the Kingdom of Bosnia continued to expand, Tvrtko&#x27;s attention shifted to the Adriatic coast. He gained control of the entire Primorje region and the major maritime cities of the area, established new settlements and started building a navy, but never succeeded in subjugating the lords of the independent Serbian territories. The death of King Louis and the accession of Queen Mary in 1382 allowed Tvrtko to take advantage of the ensuing succession crisis in Hungary and Croatia. After bitter fighting, from 1385 to 1390, Tvrtko succeeded in conquering large parts of Dalmatia, and Croatia proper. Following the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, his tenuous claim to Serbia became a mere fiction, as the Serbian rulers he sought to subdue became vassals of the victorious Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Turks also launched their first attacks on Bosnia during Tvrtko&#x27;s reign, but his army was able to repel them. Tvrtko&#x27;s sudden death in 1391 prevented him from solidifying the Kotromanić hold on Croatian lands.

Tvrtko is widely considered one of Bosnia&#x27;s greatest medieval rulers, having enlarged the country&#x27;s borders to their greatest extent, left a strong economy, and improved the living standards of his subjects. He was survived by at least one son, Tvrtko II, but was succeeded by Dabiša, under whom Tvrtko&#x27;s burgeoning realm began to decay.

==Minority==
Tvrtko was the elder son of Vladislav Kotromanić and Jelena Šubić and was likely born within a year of their marriage, which was celebrated in 1337. His father was the brother of the Bosnian ban, Stephen II, and his mother the daughter of the Croatian lord George II Šubić of Bribir. Although Vladislav was still alive, Stephen&#x27;s title passed directly to Tvrtko; the reason for Vladislav&#x27;s exclusion from the Kotromanić succession is unclear. Tvrtko, however, was only about fifteen years old at the time, so his father governed as regent. Soon after his accession, Tvrtko travelled with his father throughout the realm to settle relations with his vassals. Jelena replaced Vladislav as regent upon his death in 1354. She immediately travelled to Hungary to obtain consent to Tvrtko&#x27;s accession from King Louis I, his overlord. Following her return, Jelena held an assembly (&quot;stanak&quot;) in Mile, with mother and son confirming the possessions and privileges of the noblemen of &quot;all of Bosnia, Donji Kraji, Zagorje, and the Hum land&quot;.
The death of Tvrtko&#x27;s maternal uncle Mladen III Šubić in 1348 led to a decline of the Šubić noble family and a long conflict over their lands. In May 1355, Jelena and Tvrtko marched with an army to Duvno in order to claim Tvrtko&#x27;s share of her brother&#x27;s patrimony. An agreement was reached with the vice-ban of Dalmatia by which Tvrtko was to inherit all the cities held by his maternal grandfather and a city which belonged to his aunt Katarina. Still, it is unknown whether he actually took possession of them.

The state assembled by Tvrtko&#x27;s uncle Stephen broke apart on Tvrtko&#x27;s accession, much to the satisfaction of his overlord King Louis. The Hungarians were keen to encourage Stephen&#x27;s vassals to act independently from Tvrtko, forcing Tvrtko to compete with Louis for their loyalty in order to rebuild the Bosnian state. Louis posed a more direct threat as well; he was determined to enlarge his royal domain, and throughout his realm he ardently reclaimed all lands that once belonged to the monarch. Taking advantage of the precarious situation early in Tvrtko&#x27;s reign, Louis moved to claim most of Donji Kraji and western Hum up to the river Neretva, including the prosperous customs town of Drijeva. In 1357, he succeeded in compelling Tvrtko to come to Hungary and surrender these territories as the dowry of Stephen&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth, who had been married to Louis since 1353. In July, King Louis confirmed Tvrtko and his younger brother Vuk as rulers of Bosnia and Usora. Donji Kraji and Hum were purposely omitted from their title, with Usora likely having been granted as compensation. Two conditions were forced upon the Bosnians: one of the two Kotromanić brothers would be at Louis&#x27;s court whenever the other was in Bosnia, and they would make an effort to suppress the &quot;heretical&quot; Bosnian Church.

== Initial difficulties ==
Little is known about internal affairs in Bosnia between 1357 when Tvrtko started ruling on his own and 1363. His religious policy came into focus in this period, as the Avignon papacy became more insistent on curbing the Bosnian Church. This endangered Tvrtko, for although he was a Roman Catholic throughout his life, Louis now had a religious pretext for invading Bosnia. The death of the bishop of Bosnia—Peregrin Saxon, a supporter of both Stephen II and Tvrtko I and acknowledged by the latter as his &quot;spiritual father&quot;—led to the appointment of Peter Siklósi to the episcopal throne. Peter actively promoted the idea of launching a new crusade against Bosnia, earning him Tvrtko&#x27;s hostility. Tvrtko even attempted to plot against Peter but failed when his letters to a lector in Peter&#x27;s Đakovo residence were discovered. The Bosnian Church, meanwhile, survived throughout Tvrtko&#x27;s reign but only became prominent in state affairs after his death. One hostile source even tried to link Tvrtko himself to the Church due to his tolerance of all local faiths, including Hum&#x27;s Eastern Orthodoxy.
At the start of his personal rule, the young Ban somehow considerably increased his power. Although he constantly emphasized his subservience and loyalty to the King, Tvrtko started regarding the loyalty of the Donji Kraji noblemen to Louis as treachery against himself. In 1363, a conflict broke out between the two men. The cause is not clear, although Louis stated that his intention was to eradicate the Bosnian heretics. By April, the King had begun amassing an army; and in May, officials of the Republic of Ragusa ordered their merchants to leave Bosnia due to an imminent clash. An army led by Louis himself attacked Donji Kraji, where the nobility was divided in its loyalties between Tvrtko and Louis. A month later an army led by the palatine of Hungary, Nicholas Kont, and the archbishop of Esztergom, Nicholas Apáti, struck Usora. Vlatko Vukoslavić deserted to Louis and surrendered to him the important fortress of Ključ, but Vukac Hrvatinić succeeded in defending the Soko Grad fortress in the &quot;župa&quot; of Pliva, forcing the Hungarians to retreat. In Usora, the Srebrenik Fortress held out against a &quot;massive attack&quot; by the royal army, which suffered the embarrassment of losing the King&#x27;s seal. The successful defense of Srebrenik marked Tvrtko&#x27;s first victory against Hungary.
The unity of the Bosnian magnates waned as soon as the Hungarians were defeated, weakening Tvrtko&#x27;s position and that of a united Bosnia. In 1364, Tvrtko, his mother, and his brother were granted citizenship of the Republic of Venice, an honour that guaranteed them sanctuary in Venice in case of necessity but also obligated Tvrtko to protect Venetian merchants. Various charters issued by the previous bans of Bosnia, and confirmed by Tvrtko on his accession, promised the same protection to Ragusan merchants. In late 1365, however, both republics complained to Tvrtko about the treatment of their merchants by his vassals. Evidently, the Ban had lost control over his feudatories. The anarchy escalated, and in February of the following year, the magnates revolted against Tvrtko and dethroned him. Little is known about the circumstances under which Tvrtko was deposed. Accusing the magnates of treachery against &quot;foremostly God&quot; and himself, Tvrtko fled Bosnia with his mother. He was replaced by his younger brother, who had hitherto functioned as &quot;junior ban&quot;. Vuk&#x27;s personal role in the rebellion is uncertain.

Tvrtko acted resolutely and efficiently. He and Jelena took refuge at the Hungarian royal court, where they were welcomed by Tvrtko&#x27;s former enemy and overlord, King Louis. Apparently dissatisfied with the turn of events in Bosnia, Louis provided Tvrtko with aid (likely military) in reclaiming Bosnia. Tvrtko returned to Bosnia in March and reestablished control over a part of the country by the end of the month, including the areas of Donji Kraji, Rama (where he then resided), Hum, and Usora. In order to secure the loyalty of the noblemen he had subjugated, as well as to win over those still supporting Vuk, Tvrtko bestowed a number of grants; in August he invested Vukac Hrvatinić with the entire &quot;župa&quot; of Pliva for his part in the 1363 war with Hungary. After initially rapid success, Tvrtko&#x27;s campaign slowed. Sanko Miltenović, ruler of eastern Hum, defected to Vuk in late 1366. Throughout the following year, Tvrtko forced Vuk southwards, eventually compelling him to flee to Ragusa. Sanko, Vuk&#x27;s last supporter, submitted to Tvrtko in late summer and was allowed to retain his holdings. Ragusan officials made an effort to procure peace between the feuding brothers, and in 1368, Vuk asked Pope Urban V to intervene with King Louis I on his behalf. Those efforts were futile; but by 1374, Tvrtko had reconciled with Vuk on very generous terms.

== Conquests in Serbia and marriage ==
The death of Dušan the Mighty and the accession of his son Uroš the Weak in December 1355 was soon followed by the breakup of the once-powerful and threatening Serbian Empire. It disintegrated into autonomous lordships that could not resist Bosnia by themselves. This paved the way for Tvrtko to expand towards the east, but internal problems prevented him from seizing the opportunity immediately. A lordship on Bosnia&#x27;s eastern border was that of Vojislav Vojinović. When Vojislav attacked Ragusa in 1361, the republic appealed to Tvrtko for help, but to no avail. Vojislav&#x27;s widow Gojislava, ruling on behalf of their minor sons, provided Tvrtko with passage through the family&#x27;s land during his struggle with Vuk, and Tvrtko remained cordial with the family. He was, however, unable to defend her from her nephew Nicholas Altomanović, who, by November 1368, had seized her sons&#x27; lands. All Tvrtko could do was help the dispossessed widow safely reach her native Albania.
The ambitious Nicholas soon started inciting rebellions against Tvrtko; Sanko Miltenović rose against his lord again and was once more defeated and pardoned in 1369. Tvrtko and Nicholas made peace in August 1370, but the latter&#x27;s belligerence soon earned him the enmity of all his neighbours. Entering into a coalition with Venice and the Lord of Zeta, Đurađ I, Nicholas intended to attack Ragusa and Kotor. Tvrtko and Lazar Hrebljanović, lord of Moravian Serbia, both backed by Louis of Hungary, acted to protect the cities. Lazar, too, swore fealty to Louis, after which he and Tvrtko were given 1,000 horsemen to counter Nicholas, who was completely defeated in the autumn of 1373, his lands being divided between the victorious allies. Tvrtko took the upper Podrinje, Gacko, and a part of Polimlje with the Mileševa Monastery. This was the first significant expansion of Bosnia during Tvrtko&#x27;s reign and gave him substantial influence over Serbian affairs.

In 1374, Tvrtko married Dorothea, daughter of Tsar Ivan Stratsimir of Bulgaria. The marriage was likely arranged by Louis, who had kept Dorothea and her sister as honored hostages at his court to ensure Ivan Stratsimir&#x27;s loyalty. The bride was Orthodox, but the marriage was celebrated in the Catholic rite by Tvrtko&#x27;s old enemy Peter, bishop of Bosnia, to whom Tvrtko then awarded large tracts of land. Tvrtko thereby solidified his relations with the Roman Catholic Church and earned recognition from Pope Gregory XI.

The division of Nicholas Altomanović&#x27;s lands created friction between Tvrtko and Đurađ I Balšić since the latter seized coastal &quot;župas&quot;, which Tvrtko had expected to annex. In early 1377, Tvrtko successfully plotted with the Travunians the takeover of Trebinje, Konavli, and Dračevica, making his final conquests of the Serbian lands. By that time, Serbia had been reduced to a patchwork of independent lordships.

==Coronation==

Uroš the Weak, the last of the Nemanjić dynasty, died in December 1371. His chosen co-ruler, Vukašin Mrnjavčević, left a son, Marko, who took up the royal title. Having been forced to accept Ottoman suzerainty, Marko was not recognized as king by any of the Serbian magnates, effectively leaving the throne vacant. Serbia was divided between Marko (whose small realm extended no further than western Macedonia), Lazar (the greatest lord), Vuk Branković (Lazar&#x27;s son-in-law), George of Zeta, and Tvrtko of Bosnia.

The idea of restoring the Serbian Empire nevertheless persisted. George discussed it in one of his charters, but the Serbian regional lords were not considered suitable. They had only recently risen to prominence and lacked illustrious family backgrounds and formal titles to their lands; they were mere &quot;lords&quot;. Tvrtko not only controlled a significant portion of Serbia but was a member of the dynasty which had ruled as bans of Bosnia from time immemorial and—most importantly—could boast descent from the Nemanjić dynasty. A genealogy published in Tvrtko&#x27;s newly conquered Serbian lands emphasized his Nemanjić ancestry, derived from his paternal grandmother, Elizabeth, daughter of King Dragutin. A Serbian logothete named Blagoje, having found refuge at Tvrtko&#x27;s court, attributed to Tvrtko the right to a &quot;double crown&quot;: one for Bosnia, which his family had ruled since its foundation, and the other for the Serbian lands of his Nemanjić ancestors, who had &quot;left the earthly realm for the heavenly kingdom&quot;. Arguing that Serbia had been &quot;left without its pastor&quot;, Tvrtko set out to be crowned as its king.

Tvrtko&#x27;s coronation as king of Bosnia and Serbia was held in the fall of 1377 (probably 26 October, the feast day of Saint Demetrius). However, there is still no full consensus as to where, and by whom it was performed. The opinion that the Ragusan chronicler Mavro Orbini, when he wrote in 1601 that the coronation was performed by metropolitan bishop in the monastery of &quot;Mileševa in town with the same name&quot;, meant the monastery was Mileševa and the person who performed coronation was its Orthodox metropolitan bishop, was adopted among historians like Jiriček (in 1923), Ćorović (1925), Dinić (1932), Solovjev (1933). Such an opinion, still perpetuated only in Serbian historiography, contradict recent researches based on modern methodology elsewhere. Citing more recent archaeological and historical researches, Croatian and Bosnian historians agree that the coronation took place in the Franciscan Church of Saint Nicholas in the Bosnian town of Mile. This place is certainly the undisputed location of the coronations of Tvrtko I&#x27;s successors, as well as the burial place of some of his predecessors.

Writing to Ragusa shortly after his coronation, Tvrtko successfully claimed Saint Demetrius&#x27; income, which had been paid to the kings of Serbia since the 13th century. Although he presented himself as the heir to the Nemanjić crown, Tvrtko decided to assume the royal title of his great-grandfather, rather than continue Dušan&#x27;s unpopular claim to an imperial style, thus becoming &quot;by the Grace of God king of the Serbs, Bosnia, Pomorje and the Western Areas&quot;. In addition to the royal title, Tvrtko also adopted the symbolic name Stephen in order to associate himself with the Nemanjić kings; his successors followed suit. Tvrtko, at times, completely omitted his birth name and used only the honorific. Tvrtko&#x27;s right to kingship was derived from his right to the Serbian throne, and was likely recognized by Lazar Hrebljanović and Vuk Branković. Still, Tvrtko never established authority over the regional lords of Serbia. Tvrtko&#x27;s new title was also approved by Louis and by his successor Mary. Venice and Ragusa consistently referred to Tvrtko as king of Rascia, Ragusa even complaining, in 1378, about Tvrtko&#x27;s preoccupation with his new kingdom. Despite his cordial relations with its clergy, Tvrtko&#x27;s claim to Serbia did not enjoy the support of the Orthodox Church, severely hindering Tvrtko&#x27;s efforts.

== Economy ==

Having taken as much Serbian land as he could, King Tvrtko turned his attention to the coast. The rapid economic growth of Bosnia, having begun during the reign of Tvrtko&#x27;s uncle, continued unabated even during the political upheavals that followed Tvrtko&#x27;s accession. The export of metal ores and metalwork (mainly silver, copper and lead) formed the backbone of the Bosnian economy. These goods were transported over the Dinaric Alps to the seashore, where they were bought chiefly by the Republics of Ragusa and Venice. The maritime cities of Ragusa and Kotor also depended on Tvrtko&#x27;s realm for food, a dependency the King leveraged to increase the initially low and, for the Bosnians, disadvantageous prices. Yet, Bosnia could not make economical use of its share of the Adriatic coast, from the river Neretva to the Bay of Kotor, which lacked any major settlements. The three major cities in the area were all controlled by Hungary: Drijeva (which Tvrtko was forced to cede to Louis in 1357), Ragusa, and Kotor.

The War of Chioggia erupted between the old-time rival Republics of Venice and Genoa in 1378, and it soon involved Venice&#x27;s neighbours. King Louis took Genoa&#x27;s side, and Ragusa—subordinate to Hungary, and Venice&#x27;s competitor in the Adriatic—did so as well. The Venetians, having taken Kotor in August 1378, made an effort to have Tvrtko join the war on their side, which caused panic in Ragusa. Tvrtko, however, offered the Ragusans help in fighting Venice, which they initially refused. The death of George I of Zeta warranted Tvrtko&#x27;s involvement in Serbian affairs, which reduced his ability to take an active part in the conflict. The Ragusans started calling for the destruction of Kotor, whose officials promised to renounce fealty to Venice and return to Louis. Kotor failed to fulfil this promise but instead promised fealty to Tvrtko, who laid claim to the city as part of his Nemanjić ancestors&#x27; heritage. The political climate was ideal since he was to take Kotor from his overlord&#x27;s enemy. The Ragusans were furious, and an embargo ensued. Tvrtko defended Kotor from Ragusa but was betrayed in June 1379, when the city overthrew its Venetian governor and submitted again directly to Louis.
The failure to seize Kotor, the damage to the Bosnian economy from the Ragusan embargo, and the need for easier access to maritime trade led Tvrtko to found the youngest medieval town on the eastern Adriatic coast. In early 1382, Tvrtko constructed a new fortress in the Bay of Kotor and decided that it should form the basis of a new salt trading center. Initially named after Saint Stephen, the city came to be known as Novi (meaning &quot;new&quot;). Commerce started in August, when the first ships carrying salt arrived, but so did trouble. Kotor and the merchants from Dalmatia and the Italian Peninsula looked favourably on the development, but the Ragusans were very displeased at the prospect of losing their salt trade monopoly. They argued that Tvrtko, as king of Serbia, should respect the exclusive rights to salt trade granted by his Nemanjić predecessors to Ragusa, Kotor, Drijeva, and Sveti Srđ. During the dispute, Ragusa hindered Novi&#x27;s commerce and assembled an alliance of Dalmatian cities against Bosnia and Venice. Tvrtko relented by November, and his new city failed to achieve his purpose.

== Hungarian succession crisis ==

Tvrtko&#x27;s yielding in the legal dispute with Ragusa may have been brought about by another major change: the death of King Louis I on 11 September 1382. Without a male heir, the Hungarian crown passed to Louis&#x27;s 13-year-old daughter Mary and the reins of government to his widow, Tvrtko&#x27;s cousin Elizabeth. The great unpopularity of the queens led to rebellions and presented an opportunity for Tvrtko, not only to reclaim Drijeva and other lands lost to Louis in 1357 but also to seize Kotor. When exactly or how this took place is not known. Already in the spring of 1383, Tvrtko started building a navy: he bought a galley from Venice, ordered two more to be built, and employed a Venetian patrician as his admiral with the consent of the republic. Around the same time, he erected a new town, Brštanik, near present-day Opuzen.

In 1385, Tvrtko still formally recognized Hungarian supremacy, although it no longer had any practical meaning. He emphasized his loyalty to the queens, &quot;his dearest sisters&quot;, and cited his oath of fealty to them. Mary and Elizabeth, however, had no power to enforce their suzerainty over him. In fact, they so respected his strength that they made concessions to win his favour: one of the concessions being their recognition of Tvrtko&#x27;s possession of Kotor in the spring of 1385. The incorporation of the trade centres of Drijeva and Kotor did not result in a significant expansion on the coast, but it was of great importance to the Bosnian economy and the King&#x27;s finances.

The capture of Kotor earned Tvrtko the enmity of George I of Zeta&#x27;s brother and successor, Balša II, who also desired the city. Nothing is known about Balša&#x27;s military conflict with Tvrtko except that the latter asked Venice, whose trading opportunities were threatened by the clashes, to mediate with the Lord of Zeta. The mediation was thwarted by Balša&#x27;s death in the 1385 Battle of Savra against the invading Ottomans. Balša&#x27;s nephew and successor, George II, maintained Zeta&#x27;s hostility toward Bosnia.

The revolt against Elizabeth and Mary culminated in late 1385 when Mary was deposed in favour of her kinsman, King Charles III of Naples. Elizabeth had Charles assassinated the following February, and Mary was restored to the throne. On 25 July, however, both women ended up imprisoned by the supporters of the murdered monarch&#x27;s son, King Ladislaus of Naples. Civil war engulfed Mary&#x27;s realm. Her betrothed, Sigismund, invaded Bohemia with the intent to liberate her and ascend her throne. The neighbouring countries took sides: Venice opted for the queens and Sigismund, but Tvrtko chose to support their opponents and Ladislaus&#x27;s claim to Hungary, thus tacitly renouncing vassalage that had in any case been only nominal since 1370. Elizabeth was strangled in prison, while Sigismund&#x27;s coronation as King of Hungary in March 1387 and subsequent liberation of Mary prompted Tvrtko to act more resolutely. From Ragusa, still loyal to Queen Mary, exacted a promise of support against everyone but the Queen. From then on, he was free to attack Dalmatia, ostensibly in the name of the king of Naples.
Dalmatian cities remained loyal to Mary and Sigismund, not least thanks to the couple&#x27;s alliance with Venice. A notable exception was Klis, which supported the rebellious nobleman John of Palisna. Tvrtko took control of the Klis Fortress in July 1387, which enabled him to launch attacks on Split. Although the Bosnian army laid waste to Split and Zadar areas, the cities refused to capitulate. Their officials were willing to honour King Tvrtko but insisted that Queen Mary and King Sigismund were their legitimate sovereigns. Ostrovica Fortress submitted to Tvrtko in November, followed by Trogir.

The military forces of Tvrtko and his vassal Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić campaigned in Slavonia together with John and Paul Horvat.

By 1388, the devastation of Dalmatia by the Bosnian army had become so severe that the authorities of the cities pleaded with Sigismund to either help them or to allow them to save themselves by submitting without being labelled as traitors. Neither Sigismund&#x27;s army nor an alliance of Dalmatian cities and noblemen was able to counter Tvrtko&#x27;s advances. Split, Zadar, and Šibenik having lost all hope, Tvrtko called upon them to negotiate their surrender in March 1389. Each city asked to be the last one to submit and even to be allowed to request Sigismund&#x27;s assistance. Tvrtko granted their wish and decided that Split should be the last to submit by 15 June 1389.

== Ottoman attacks ==
During his campaign in Dalmatia and Croatia, Tvrtko was also engaged in skirmishes in the east of his realm, preventing him from focusing all of his manpower on expansion westwards. The Kingdom of Bosnia was believed to be far from the reach of the Ottomans during Tvrtko I&#x27;s reign, shielded by a belt of independent Serbian statelets. George II of Zeta, however, purposely enabled the Turks to launch raids against Bosnia, first in 1386 (of which little is known) and again in 1388. In the second instance, the Ottoman and Zetan invaders, led by Lala Şahin Pasha, penetrated as far as Bileća. The Battle of Bileća, which took place in late August 1388, ended with the victory of the Bosnian army, led by Duke Vlatko Vuković.

15 June 1389, the date by which Tvrtko had intended to complete his conquest of Dalmatia, was also the day when the Ottoman army met the forces of a coalition of Serbian states at the Battle of Kosovo. Tvrtko, feeling it is his duty as king of Serbia, ordered his army to leave Dalmatia and assist the lord&#x27;s Lazar Hrebljanović and Vuk Branković. He resented the Milanese ruler, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, for selling weaponry to the Ottomans in wake of the battle. The highest ranking among the casualties, which also included Bosnian noblemen, were Lazar and the Ottoman ruler Murad I. The outcome of the battle was difficult to ascertain, but Vlatko&#x27;s letters from the battlefield convinced Tvrtko that the Christian alliance came out victorious. Tvrtko, in turn, informed various Christian states of his great triumph; the authorities of the Republic of Florence responded praising both the Kingdom of Bosnia and its king for achieving a &quot;victory so glorious that the memory of it would never fade&quot;. The triumph, however, was hollow. Tvrtko&#x27;s Serbian title lost what little actual significance it had when Lazar&#x27;s successors accepted Ottoman suzerainty, while Vuk Branković turned to Tvrtko&#x27;s enemy Sigismund. Since the Battle of Kosovo, the Bosnian claim to the Serbian throne was merely nominal.

== Final achievements and aftermath ==

Tvrtko&#x27;s engagement in the east allowed Sigismund&#x27;s forces to reverse some of his gains in Dalmatia. Klis was briefly lost in July, the Dalmatian cities again refused to surrender, and Tvrtko was forced to relaunch raids. A series of battles and skirmishes from November to December resulted in a decisive Bosnian victory and the retreat of the Hungarian army. In May 1390, the cities and the Dalmatian islands finally surrendered to Tvrtko, who then started calling himself &quot;by the grace of God king of Rascia, Bosnia, Dalmatia, Croatia, and Pomorje&quot;. Acting as king of Dalmatia and Croatia, Tvrtko appointed his supporters John of Palisna and John Horvat as his bans and hosted the Archbishop of Split Andrea Gualdo in Sutjeska.

In the last months of his reign, Tvrtko devoted himself to solidifying his position in Dalmatia and to plans for taking Zadar, the only Dalmatian city that had evaded his rule. He offered an extensive alliance to Venice, but it did not suit the republic&#x27;s interests. Meanwhile, Tvrtko was also fostering relations with Albert III, Duke of Austria. By the late summer of 1390, a marriage was expected to be contracted between the recently widowed Tvrtko and a member of the Austrian ruling family, the Habsburgs. Hungary remained the focus of Tvrtko&#x27;s foreign policy, however. Although they did not recognize each other as kings, Tvrtko and Sigismund started negotiating peace in September. Sigismund was in a weaker position and likely ready to make concessions to Tvrtko when his ambassadors arrived at Tvrtko&#x27;s court in January 1391. The negotiations were probably never concluded, as Tvrtko died on 10 March. He is buried in Mile alongside his uncle Stephen II.

Tvrtko I left at least one son, Tvrtko II, whose legitimacy is debated, and who was a minor and apparently not considered fit to succeed his father. Dabiša, a relative (possibly illegitimate half-brother) exiled by Tvrtko I for his part in the 1366 rebellion and reconciled with him in 1390, was elected king instead. Ostoja, the next king, may have been Tvrtko I&#x27;s illegitimate son (or more likely another illegitimate half-brother).

== Assessment ==
Tvrtko I is considered one of the greatest medieval rulers of Bosnia, having &quot;left behind a country larger, stronger, politically more influential and militarily more capable than the one he inherited.&quot; His political achievements were aided by the feudal anarchy in Serbia and Croatia, while the Ottomans were still not close enough to threaten him seriously. The Bosnian economy flourished, new settlements and trade centres appeared, and his subjects&#x27; living standards improved.

Vladimir Ćorović noted that, compared with Dušan, who had also left a considerably extended state, Tvrtko was not an overly ambitious conqueror as much as he was an able statesman. Tvrtko, he wrote, used force when necessary but otherwise took care to appear to Serbians as the legitimate heir rather than as a foreign subjugator and to the Croatians as the preferable ruler. Emphasizing his patience and diplomacy, Ćorović calls Tvrtko a man capable of making the most out of his opportunities.

<text>The J Nassau Street Local and Z Nassau Street Express are two rapid transit services in the B Division of the New York City Subway. Their route emblems, or &quot;bullets&quot;, are colored since they use the BMT Nassau Street Line in Lower Manhattan.

The J operates 24 hours a day, while the Z, operating as the rush hour variant to the J, operates during weekday rush hours in the peak direction only; both services operate between Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer in Jamaica, Queens, and Broad Street in Lower Manhattan. When the Z operates, the two services form a skip-stop pair between Sutphin Boulevard–JFK and Myrtle Avenue-Broadway and also makes express stops between Myrtle and Marcy Avenues in Brooklyn. Weekday midday J service also makes express stops between Myrtle and Marcy Avenues, while weekday evening, weekend daytime and daily overnight service makes all stops along the full route.

The J/Z&#x27;s current skip-stop pattern was implemented in 1988. The J/Z is derived from four routes:

== History ==
=== Before the Chrystie Street Connection ===
The Jamaica Line – then known as the Broadway Elevated – was one of the original elevated lines in Brooklyn, completed in 1893 from Cypress Hills west to Broadway Ferry in Williamsburg. It was then a two-track line, with a single local service between the two ends, and a second east of Gates Avenue, where the Lexington Avenue Elevated merged. This second service later became the 12, and was eliminated on October 13, 1950, with the abandonment of the Lexington Avenue Elevated.

The second major service on the Broadway Elevated ran between Canarsie and Williamsburg via the BMT Canarsie Line, started on July 30, 1906, when the Broadway and Canarsie tracks were connected at East New York. As part of the Dual Contracts, an extension from Cypress Hills east to Jamaica was completed on July 3, 1918, a third track was added west of East New York, and express trains began running on it in 1922.

The Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation numbered its services in 1924, and the Canarsie and Jamaica services became 14 and 15. Both ran express during rush hours in the peak direction west of East New York. Express trains would only stop at Myrtle Avenue, Essex Street and Canal Street, before making local stops afterwards. Additional 14 trains, between Eastern Parkway or Atlantic Avenue on the Canarsie Line and Manhattan provided rush-hour local service on Broadway. When the 14th Street–Eastern Line and Canarsie Line were connected on July 14, 1928, the old &quot;Canarsie Line&quot; service was renamed the &quot;Broadway (Brooklyn) Line&quot;, providing only weekday local service over the Broadway Elevated west of Eastern Parkway. The Atlantic Avenue trips remained, and rush-hour trains continued to serve Rockaway Parkway (Canarsie), though they did not use the Broadway express tracks. The 14 was later cut back to only rush-hour service.

On the Manhattan end, the first extension was made on September 16, 1908, when the Williamsburg Bridge subway tracks opened. Broadway and Canarsie trains were extended to the new Essex Street terminal, and further to Chambers Street when the line was extended on August 4, 1913. When the BMT Nassau Street Line was completed on May 30, 1931, the 15 was extended to Broad Street, and the 14 was truncated to Canal Street.

Weekday midday 14 Broadway-Brooklyn Local and midday 15 Jamaica Express service was discontinued on June 26, 1952. Some 14 trains began terminating at Crescent Street on the Jamaica Line in 1956.
Manhattan-bound rush hour skip-stop service between Jamaica and East New York was implemented on June 18, 1959, with trains leaving 168th Street on weekdays between 7 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. Express 15 trains served &quot;A&quot; stations, while the morning 14 became the &quot;Jamaica Local&quot;, running between Jamaica and Canal Street, and stopped at stations marked &quot;B&quot;. Express 15 trains continued to run express between Eastern Parkway and Canal Street, making only stops at Myrtle Avenue, Essex Street, and Canal Street. These stations were as follows:
* All trains: 168th Street • Sutphin Boulevard • 75th Street–Elderts Lane • Eastern Parkway • Myrtle Avenue • Essex Street • Canal Street
* &quot;A&quot; stations: 168th Street • Sutphin Boulevard • 121st Street • 111th Street • Woodhaven Boulevard • 85th Street–Forest Parkway • Elderts Lane • Crescent Street • Cleveland Street • Eastern Parkway
* &quot;B&quot; stations: 168th Street • 160th Street • Sutphin Boulevard • Queens Boulevard • Metropolitan Avenue • 104th Street • Elderts Lane • Cypress Hills • Norwood Avenue • Van Siclen Avenue • Alabama Avenue • Eastern Parkway

Letters were assigned to most BMT services in the early 1960s. The BMT Jamaica services retained their numbers until November 1967. The 15 became the J (express), and the 14 became the JJ.
=== Chrystie Street Connection to 1977 ===

When the Chrystie Street Connection opened on November 26, 1967, many services were changed. The two local services – the JJ (non-rush hour Jamaica local, and rush hour Broadway-Brooklyn local) – continued as the JJ without any major routing changes. Thus non-rush hour JJ trains ran between Jamaica and Broad Street, while morning rush hour JJ trains ran to Canal Street, and afternoon rush hour JJ trains ran between Canal Street and Atlantic Avenue or Crescent Street. The rush-hour express J was combined with the weekday &quot;Brighton Local via tunnel&quot; to form the weekday QJ, running between Jamaica and Brighton Beach via the Jamaica Line (express during rush hours in the peak direction), BMT Nassau Street Line, Montague Street Tunnel, and BMT Brighton Line (local). Finally, the was a special peak-direction rush-hour service, running local on the Jamaica Line in the AM, express in the PM, Nassau Street Line, Montague Street Tunnel, and BMT Fourth Avenue Line to 95th Street in Fort Hamilton. This service served two purposes: (1) early AM service from Jamaica prior to the first QJ trains got the equipment to 95th Street in Brooklyn in time for the AM rush, and obviated the need to have early service to Brighton Beach; and (2) in the evening, trains returned from 95th Street in Brooklyn to Jamaica, allowing the QJ to avoid having to run on the Brighton Line in the Manhattan direction post-rush hour.
The next change was made on July 1, 1968, when the Chrystie Street Connection tracks to the Williamsburg Bridge opened. A new service, KK, was instituted that provided skip-stop service from 168th Street/Jamaica along with the QJ in both AM and PM rush hours; because of the limited skip-stop time spans, other terminals for the KK included Rockaway Parkway, Atlantic Avenue, Eastern Parkway and 111th Street. The KK provided service to 57th Street/6th Avenue, as the B served 168th Street-Washington Heights during rush hours; during non-rush hours, the B began serving 57th Street/6th Avenue. The MM (depicted with a dark green bullet on R27 signage) had been proposed as a supplement to the KK as a local to 57th Street–Sixth Avenue, but was kept as the M and extended from Chambers Street to Broad Street. The was eliminated, being cut north of Chambers Street and relabeled as an RR variant, and the off-hour JJ was relabeled QJ. Less than two months later, on August 18, the QJ was extended to Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue, and the D cut back to Brighton Beach during QJ operating hours in order to avoid switching delays at Brighton Beach. On July 14, 1969, afternoon skip-stop service on the KK and QJ was discontinued due to rider complaints.

On January 2, 1973, the QJ, which was the longest route in the transit system, was cut back to Broad Street and redesignated the J; and the was extended to Coney Island in its place. At the same time, the KK was cut back to Eastern Parkway from 168th Street and renamed the K, and both skip-stop patterns were carried out by alternate J trains between 7:25 a.m. and 8:12 a.m.. J trains making A stops trains stopped at 168th Street, Sutphin Boulevard, Metropolitan Avenue, 111th Street, Woodhaven Boulevard, Elderts Lane, Cypress Hills, Norwood Avenue, Van Siclen Avenue, and Eastern Parkway, while trains making B stops stopped at 168th Street, 160th Street, Queens Boulevard, 121st Street, 102nd Street, Forest Parkway, Elderts Lane, Crescent Street, Cleveland Street, and Eastern Parkway. All J trains would run express between Eastern Parkway and Essex Street between 6:00 a.m. and 9:05 a.m. from 168th Street, and from 3:35 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. leaving Essex Street.

The K was discontinued entirely on August 30, 1976, eliminating the J skip-stop and express service east of Myrtle Avenue in the evening rush hour. Skip-stop service was retained toward Manhattan during the morning rush hour. One-way express service remained west of Myrtle Avenue, for the M was switched to the local tracks at that time. On January 24, 1977, as part of a series of NYCTA service cuts to save $13 million, many subway lines began running shorter trains during middays. As part of the change, J trains began running with four cars between 9:15 a.m. and 1:15 p.m. On May 2, 1977, J trains began running in skip-stop service between Eastern Parkway and Myrtle Avenue. Chauncey Street and Gates Avenue were designated as A stops, while Halsey Street and Kosciusko Street were designated as B stops.

The following table summarizes the changes that were made between 1959 and 1976.
=== 1977 to present ===
====Archer Avenue Line====
The J was truncated to Queens Boulevard just after midnight on September 11, 1977, and to 121st Street on April 15, 1985, as portions of the elevated Jamaica Line closed and were demolished. The Q49 shuttle bus replaced service at the closed stations until 1988. On December 1, 1980, AM rush hour skip-stop service was discontinued.

The BMT Archer Avenue Line opened on December 11, 1988, extending the line east from 121st Street to Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer. The Z train first ran that day, introducing the present J/Z skip-stop pattern. The new Z trains would go skip-stop between Jamaica Center and Broadway Junction (later extended to Myrtle Avenue) during rush hours, then making all J stops to Broad Street. Bus service on several Queens bus routes was rerouted to serve Jamaica Center instead of the 169th Street station several blocks away. The J/Z skip-stop service was touted, in an attempt to relieve some crowding on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, as being faster to lower Manhattan than E, F, and R service. Because the MTA hoped that Queens passengers would use the J/Z instead of the E, F, and R, every subway car on the J and Z″s fleet was completely graffiti-free.

One of the goals of the Archer Avenue project was to make Jamaica Line service as attractive as possible, and as a result the TA planned to provide a form of express service. The two options considered to speed up Jamaica Line service were skip-stop service, which would have split Jamaica services into two patterns that served alternate stops, and a zone-express service, which would have split Jamaica services into a short-turn local service and a full-length express services. The zone-express option was dismissed in favor of the skip-stop option because its operation has to be very precisely timed so as to not hinder reliability, because service in the outer zone past the boundary of zone express service at Crescent Street or 111th Street would be too infrequent, and because many stations would lose half their service. Outer-zone expresses, after Crescent Street would skip stops on the local track until Eastern Parkway, from where it would run on the express track, stopping at Myrtle Avenue before going straight to Essex Street in Manhattan, skipping Marcy Avenue. Outer-zone expresses and inner-zone locals would have each been limited to frequencies of 10 minutes.

The TA decided to implement skip-stop service with two services labeled &quot;J&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;, with lightly-used stops designated as &quot;J&quot; or &quot;Z&quot; stops, and those with higher ridership being all-stop stations. The all-stop stations were Parsons Boulevard, Sutphin Boulevard, Woodhaven Boulevard, Crescent Street, Eastern Parkway, Myrtle Avenue, Marcy Avenue, and all stops in Manhattan except for Bowery, which was to be served by only the M train. Bowery&#x27;s low ridership did not justify more than one service to stop at the station; the J stopped there evenings, nights and weekends when the M did not operate into Manhattan. The J-only stops while skip-stop was operating were 111th Street, Forest Parkway, Cypress Hills, Cleveland Street, Alabama Avenue, Halsey Street and Kosciusko Street. The Z-only stops were 121st Street, 102nd Street, Elderts Lane, Norwood Avenue, Van Siclen Avenue, Chauncey Street and Gates Avenue. To further speed up service, J and Z trains would run express between Myrtle and Marcy. Trains on the J/Z ran every five minutes, an improvement over their previous headway of eight minutes. Skip-stop service ran to Manhattan in the morning between 7:15 and 8:15 a.m. and to Jamaica between 4:45 and 5:45 p.m.

Midday express service was added with J service continuing to run express in the peak direction between Marcy and Myrtle. Surveys of ridership at local stops found that service could be adequately provided by midday M service. The running time for skip-stop service from Parsons Boulevard to Broad Street was 48 minutes, compared to minutes for all-local service and 52 for the E. It was expected that 2,250 Queens Boulevard riders would switch to the J and Z. To make J/Z service more attractive, all trains on those lines consisted of refurbished subway cars that were more quiet, graffiti-free, and had improved lighting and new floors. All cars on the J/Z were expected to have air-conditioning by summer 1989.

Express service was not implemented between Broadway Junction and Myrtle Avenue because local service would have needed to be operated between those points in addition to the J and Z. The two terminals for such a service (57th Street and Broad Street) lacked spare capacity, although it was acknowledged that 57th Street on the IND Sixth Avenue Line could be used as a terminal once Manhattan Bridge subway-track repairs were completed.

Queens Borough President Claire Schulman made multiple recommendations about revisions to the service plan for the extension at the MTA&#x27;s February 1988 board meeting. She recommended that trains should use the express track between Myrtle Avenue and Eastern Parkway to reduce travel times, and that the Chrystie Street Connection be reused for service to the Jamaica Line.

====Post-1990 changes====

On September 30, 1990, weekend J service was cut back to Canal Street, but it was extended back to Chambers Street in January 1994.

From May 1 to September 1, 1999, the Williamsburg Bridge was closed for reconstruction. J trains ran only between Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer and Myrtle Avenue. J/Z skip-stop service operated in both directions between Jamaica Center and Eastern Parkway-Broadway Junction. During the closure, B39 bus service over the Williamsburg Bridge was free. The closure was anticipated to last until October 1999, but regular subway service was restored one month ahead of schedule. The project cost $130 million, including replacing the tracks support structure, signal system and other equipment. On September 1, 1999, J and Z trains, which previously skipped Bowery between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. on weekdays, began stopping there at all times.

After the September 11, 2001 attacks, service on the BMT Broadway Line in Lower Manhattan, as well as all R service, was suspended. J trains were extended beyond Broad Street via the Montague Street Tunnel to replace the R to Bay Ridge–95th Street at all times except late nights, when it only ran to Broad Street and a shuttle ran in Brooklyn between 95th and 36th Streets. J/Z skip-stop service was suspended. Normal service on all three trains was restored on October 28.

On November 20, 2008, in light of severe budget woes, the MTA announced a slew of potential service cuts; among them was the potential elimination of Z service. In May 2009, after the New York State Legislature passed legislation to offer financial support to the MTA, this planned service cut was taken off the table.

In May 2014, all trains began stopping at Alabama Avenue, presumably for the convenience of transit employees who work at the nearby East New York Yard and East New York Bus Depot. In July 2014, the MTA proposed that weekend J service be extended from Chambers Street to Broad Street. The service change went into effect on June 14, 2015.

From June 26, 2017 to April 27, 2018, J and Z trains ran local between Broadway Junction and Marcy Avenue at all times, supplementing the M, due to the BMT Myrtle Avenue Line connection being closed for reconstruction.

In March 2020, skip-stop service was temporarily suspended due to lack of ridership and train crew availability caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Full service was restored in June 2020. From December 29, 2021, to January 19, 2022, skip-stop service was again suspended due to a shortage of crew members exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

On July 1, 2022, J service was cut back to 121st Street, and skip-stop service was suspended due to track replacement on the lower levels of the Jamaica Center and Sutphin Boulevard stations. Skip-stop service to Jamaica Center was restored on September 19, 2022.

On February 26, 2023, Jamaica Center-bound J and Z trains skipped 75th Street-Elderts Lane and Woodhaven Boulevard until January 2024 as part of a four-phase station renovation project for both stations as well as accessibility improvements and elevator installation for the latter. The second phase closed the Manhattan-bound platforms for both stops from early 2024 to mid-2024. Phase 3 will close down the Jamaica Center-bound platforms at Cypress Hills on July 22, 2024, and at 85th Street–Forest Parkway on August 12, 2024, for renovations until early 2025. Phase 4 will close the Manhattan-bound platforms down until late 2025. During those phases, J and Z trains will continue to operate skip-stop service between Myrtle Avenue-Broadway and Crescent Street, Brooklyn, but with both trains making all local stops to/from Sutphin Boulevard-Archer Avenue-JFK Airport, Queens, except for the affected stops. Weekend frequencies on the J route were increased in July 2023.

From June 28 to September 3, 2024, to accommodate riders displaced by the suspension of the for signal modernization, peak-direction express J/Z service between Myrtle Avenue and Marcy Avenue was suspended, with trains operating local at all times along this segment.

<text>The province of Ragusa (; Sicilian: &quot;pruvincia &#x27;i Rausa&quot;) was a province in the autonomous region of Sicily, Italy, located in the southeast of the island. Following the abolition of the Sicilian provinces, it was replaced in 2015 by the free municipal consortium of Ragusa (Italian: &quot;libero consorzio comunale di Ragusa&quot;). Its capital is the city of Ragusa, Sicily, which is the most southerly provincial capital in Italy.

==Geography==
From Scoglitti to Pozzallo, the Ragusan coastline is approximately long. Along the Ragusan coast are many fishing villages such as Kaukana, Punta Secca, Marina di Ragusa and Marina di Modica. The Hyblaean Mountains are dominating the north of the province and its highest peaks are Monte Lauro, Monte Casale and Monte Arcibessi. The rivers of the province are the Irminio, Dirillo and Ippari and the only lake in the province is the Lago di Santa Rosalia along the course of the Irminio river. The skyline of Ragusa is punctuated by the towers, domes and cupolas of the many churches for which the province is known. The area is mostly unspoilt, as during the 19th century and early 20th century there was large migration from Ragusa to the more prosperous areas of Italy and abroad.

It has an area of and a total population of 321,192 (2017). There are 12 comunes (Italian: &quot;comuni&quot;) in the province (see comunes of the province of Ragusa). By population, they are:

==Economy==

Parts of the province have changed dramatically in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, largely due to tourism. However, others are relatively unchanged from pre-industrial times. Main productive activities can be found in the towns of Ragusa and Pozzallo, where the two major industrial areas are located. The west and south of the province are mainly dedicated to the intensive farming in greenhouses and the local vegetables leave from the &quot;Market of Vittoria&quot; to be exported to all of Europe making the province of Ragusa one of the biggest producers of greenhouse produce. In the areas around Ragusa and Modica cattle farming is at the highest levels in the region for milk, dairy and meat production. Tourism has now replaced the fishing industry as the principal source of employment along the coast.

==Transports==
*There are no motorways in the province and the main roads are the &quot;National&quot; SS.115 that crosses from west (Gela) to east (Syracuse) and the SS.514 that running north connects Ragusa to Catania. The SP.25 (&quot;Provincial Road&quot;) runs south from Ragusa to Marina di Ragusa.
*The of railway network of the province are entirely on single track and not electrified. Regional trains run regularly connecting the major cities.
*Comiso Airport during the cold-war was the biggest NATO base in Europe and has recently been refurbished to be converted from military to civil airport.
*The Port of Pozzallo is the only cargo and passengers port (service to Malta), and is located in the southern part of the province.
*The other ports are either fishing ports like Scoglitti and Donnalucata or &quot;Marinas&quot; for touristic boats like Marina di Ragusa and Punta Secca.

==Main sights==
===Baroque===

The cities of Ragusa, Modica and Scicli contain many examples of baroque architecture and from 2002 are part of the World Heritage. The main monuments are:
*Cathedral of San Giovanni (Ragusa)
*Portal of San Giorgio (Ragusa Ibla)
*Duomo of San Giorgio (Ragusa Ibla)
*San Giorgio Cathedral, Modica
*Duomo of San Pietro (Modica)
*Church of San Bartolomeo (Scicli)
*Palazzo Beneventano (Scicli)

===Archeology===
*The main archeological site of the province is the Greek city of Kamarina located on the coast.
*Others are Kasmenai, Akrillai, Scornavacche, Kaukana (Roman), the &quot;Roman Baths&quot; of Comiso and the Cava Ispica.

===Castles===
*&quot;Castle of Donnafugata&quot;, near Ragusa, is a beautiful example of country residence of the &quot;Baron Corrado Arezzo&quot; that dominates the surrounding countryside.
*&quot;Castle of the Counts of Modica&quot; in Modica town centre.
*&quot;Castle of Naselli d’Aragona&quot; in Comiso dating to 1576.
*Ruins of the fortress of &quot;Parco Forza&quot; in Ispica.
*Acate is housing the &quot;Castle of the Prince of Biscari&quot; constructed originally in 1494, it is a commanding feature of the town square. The construction of the castle was ordered by &quot;Baron Guglielmo Raimondo Paternò&quot;, its golden coloured stone work has been modified many times during its long history, it now appears more as an 18th-century palazzo than a castle, although some crenelations and towers remain.

<text>Pantagruel is an international early music ensemble specialising in semi-staged performances of Renaissance music. The group was formed in Essen, Germany at the end of 2002 by the English lutenist Mark Wheeler (lute, cittern, and gittern) and the German born Dominik Schneider (Renaissance recorder and flute, gittern, and vocals). With the addition of the Scottish soprano Hannah Morrison in 2004, the ensemble began to perform throughout Europe. 

Performances have taken place at the Münster Baroque Festival, Utrecht Early Music Festival, Aachen Bach Festival, and the National Portrait Gallery in London. In 2009 Morrison was replaced by Danish soprano Anna Maria Wierød.

The group is named after Pantagruel, the protagonist of François Rabelais&#x27;s 1532 novel &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;. They have adopted the book&#x27;s motto &quot;do what thou wilt&quot; to describe their approach to early music. They combine serious musicological research with their experience not only in classical music, but also in rock music, jazz, theatre, and dance. Their performances further expand classical concert conventions using renaissance practices of medley, improvisation, and gesture.

<text>The shikra (Tachyspiza badia) is a small bird of prey in the family Accipitridae found widely distributed in Asia and Africa where it is also called the little banded goshawk. The African forms may represent a separate species but have usually been considered as subspecies of the shikra. The shikra is very similar in appearance, as well as behavior, at least to some degree, to other species including the Chinese sparrowhawk (&quot;Tachyspiza soloensis&quot;, formerly &quot;Accipiter soloensis&quot;), Eurasian goshawk (&quot;Astur gentilis&quot;) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (&quot;Accipiter nisus&quot;). They have a sharp two-note call and exhibit the flap-and-glide flight style typical of &quot;Tachyspiza&quot; and &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks. Their calls are imitated by drongos and the common hawk-cuckoo resembles it in plumage. This species was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Accipiter&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The shikra was formally described in 1788/1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the eagles, hawks and their relatives in the genus &quot;Falco&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Falco badius&quot;. Gmelin&#x27;s description was based on the &quot;brown hawk&quot; from Ceylon that had been described and illustrated in 1776 by the English naturalist Peter Brown. The shikra was formerly placed in the large and diverse genus &quot;Accipiter&quot;. In 2024 a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study of the Accipitridae confirmed earlier work that had shown that the genus was polyphyletic. To resolve the non-monophyly, &quot;Accipiter&quot; was divided into six genera. The genus &quot;Tachyspiza&quot; was resurrected to accommodate the shikra together with 26 other species that had previously been placed in &quot;Accipiter&quot;. The resurrected genus had been introduced in 1844 by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup. The word &quot;Tachyspiza&quot; combines the Ancient Greek ταχυς (&quot;takhus&quot;) meaning &quot;fast&quot; with σπιζιας (&quot;spizias&quot;) meaning &quot;hawk&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;badia&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;chestnut-coloured&quot; or &quot;brown&quot;.

Six subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;T. b. sphenura&quot; (Rüppell, 1836) – Senegal and Gambia to southwest Arabia south to north Tanzania and north DR Congo
* &quot;T. b. polyzonoides&quot; (Smith, A, 1838) – south DR Congo and south Tanzania to South Africa
* &quot;T. b. cenchroides&quot; (Severtsov, 1873) – Caucasus to central Asia and northwest India
* &quot;T. b. dussumieri&quot; (Temminck, 1824) – central India and Bangladesh
* &quot;T. b. poliopsis&quot; (Hume, 1874) – north India to south China, Indochina and north Sumatra
* &quot;T. b. badia&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1788) – southwest India and Sri Lanka

==Description==

The shikra is a small raptor (26–30 cm long) and, like most other &quot;Tachyspiza&quot; hawks, has short rounded wings and a narrow and somewhat long tail. Adults are whitish on the underside with fine rufous bars while the upperparts are grey. The lower belly is less barred and the thighs are whitish. Males have a red iris while the females have a less red (yellowish orange) iris and brownish upperparts apart from heavier barring on the underparts. The females are slightly larger. The mesial stripe on the throat is dark but narrow. In flight the male seen from below shows a light wing lining (underwing coverts) and has blackish wing tips. When seen from above the tail bands are faintly marked on the lateral tail feathers and not as strongly marked as in the Eurasian sparrowhawk. The central tail feathers are unbanded and only have a dark terminal band. Juveniles have dark streaks and spots on the upper breast and the wing is narrowly barred while the tail has dark but narrow bands. A post juvenile transitional plumage is found with very strong barring on the contour feathers of the underside. The call is &quot;pee-wee&quot;, the first note being higher and the second being longer. In flight the calls are shorter and sharper &quot;kik-ki ... kik-ki&quot;. The Chinese sparrowhawk is somewhat similar in appearance but has swollen bright orange ceres and yellow legs with the wing tips entirely black.

Subspecies &quot;cenchroides&quot; is larger and paler and found in Turkestan, Afghanistan and eastern Iran. The Indian population &quot;dussumieri&quot; is resident on the plains and lower hills (up to 1400 m in the Himalayas). The nominate form is found in Sri Lanka and has somewhat darker grey upperparts. The Burmese shikra &quot;A. b. poliopsis&quot; may represent a distinct species. The population on the island of Car Nicobar, earlier treated as a subspecies &quot;butleri&quot; and that on Katchal Island, &quot;obsoletus&quot; are now treated as a sub-species within a full species, the Nicobar sparrowhawk (&quot;Tachyspiza butleri&quot;). The west African population &quot;T. b. sphenurus&quot; is migratory while the southern African &quot;T. b. polyzonoides&quot; is more nomadic in its movements. In Asia only &quot;T. b. cenchroides&quot; is migratory.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The shikra is found in a range of habitats including forests, farmland and urban areas. They are usually seen singly or in pairs. The flight is typical with flaps and glides. During the breeding season pairs will soar on thermals and stoop at each other. Their flight usually draws alarms among smaller birds and squirrels. They feed on rodents (including &quot;Meriones hurrianae&quot;), squirrels, small birds, small reptiles (mainly lizards but sometimes small snakes) and insects. Small birds usually dive through foliage to avoid a shikra and a Small Blue Kingfisher has been observed diving into water to escape. Babblers have been observed to rally together to drive away a shikra. They will descend to the ground to feast on emerging winged termites, hunt at dusk for small bats (such as &quot;Cynopterus sphinx&quot;) and in rare instances they may even resort to feed on carrion. In one instance a male was found feeding on a dead chick at the nest. Their calls are mimicked by drongos and this behaviour is thought to aid in stealing food by alarming other birds that the drongos associate with.

===Breeding===

The breeding season in India is in summer from March to June. The nest is a platform similar to that of crows lined with grass. Both sexes help build the nest, twigs being carried in their feet. Like crows, they may also make use of metal wires. The usual clutch is 3 to 4 eggs (when eggs are removed they lay replacements and one observer noted that they could lay as many as 7 in a season) which are pale bluish grey stippled on the broad end in black. The incubation period is 18 to 21 days.

==In culture==
The shikra was a favourite among falconers in India and Pakistan due to the ease with which it could be trained and was frequently used to procure food for the more prized falcons. They were noted for their pluck and ability to take much larger birds including partridges, crows and even young peafowl. The word &quot;shikra&quot; or &quot;shikara&quot; means hunter in the Hindi language (the male was called &quot;chipak&quot; or &quot;chipka&quot; based on call) The word Shikra is borrowed from the Urdu word (شِـكْـره) which is derived from the word shikari (شِكارى) meaning hunter.

The word is also used in the French name &quot;Le Chicquera&quot; which was however given to the red-necked falcon by Levaillant in 1799.

Famous Punjabi poet Shiv Kumar Batalvi wrote a poem called &quot;Main Ik Shikra Yaar Banaya&quot; about a lost love wherein he compares her to a shikra.

<text>The City of Whitehorse is a local government area in Victoria, Australia in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It has an area of and an estimated residential population of 171,167 as of June 2021.

== History ==
The City of Whitehorse was created in December 1994 following the amalgamation of the former cities of Box Hill and Nunawading. The municipality derives its name and logo from The White Horse Hotel, a popular coaching inn located on the corner of Elgar Road and Whitehorse Road. After its demolition in 1933, the Council acquired the horse and porch from the hotel, and they were erected on Whitehorse Road. In 1986, the monument was relocated to Box Hill Town Hall and a replica was erected in its place.

The City of Whitehorse was originally planned to be formed from the merger of the City of Box Hill and the eastern part of the City of Camberwell.

==Council==
The City of Whitehorse is divided into eleven wards: Cootamundra, Eley, Elgar, Kingsley, Lake, Mahoneys, Simpson, Sparks, Terrara, Walker and Wattle. One Councillor is elected to represent each ward, every four years. Council elections are conducted by postal voting and votes are counted using instant-runoff voting. Voting is compulsory for residents who are on the electoral roll for state elections, but voters aged 70 years or over are not obliged to vote at local council elections. The Mayor and Deputy Mayor are elected by the Councillors to serve as the principal ambassador for the city for a twelve-month term.

The current council was elected in November 2024, and its composition is:

==Past councillors==
===2000−2020 (multi-member wards)===
Whitehorse comprised five two-member wards until 2020, when they were replaced by single-member wards.

==Townships and localities==
The 2021 Census counted 169,346 residents in the City of Whitehorse, up from 162,078 in 2016.

==Culture==

Neighbours is filmed in Vermont South; Pin Oak Court is the real cul-de-sac that has doubled for Ramsay Street since 1985. All of the houses featured in the show are real and the residents allow &quot;Neighbours&quot; to shoot external scenes in their front and back yards and on occasions, in their garages. Owing to its association with the show, Pin Oak Court has become popular with tourists; Tours to the cul-de-sac run throughout the year. The interior scenes are filmed at the Global Television studios in the adjacent suburb of Forest Hill.

Box Hill has variously supported an eponymous brass band since 1889.

==Sister city relations==

On 12 May 1971, the City of Box Hill established a sister city relationship with Matsudo, in Chiba, Japan. In December 1994, when Box Hill amalgamated with Nunawading, the City of Whitehorse re-affirmed its relationship with Matsudo.

In April 2005, the City of Whitehorse signed a Memorandum of Friendship and Understanding with Shaoxing, in Zhejiang, China. The Memorandum of Friendship and Understanding aims to foster international liaisons and links and facilitate the exchange of information and personal visits, as well as to strengthen economic, tourism and educational connections between the two cities through sharing knowledge and cultural understanding.

==Libraries==
All libraries in the City of Whitehorse are operated by the Whitehorse Manningham Regional Library Corporation, 
which also has 4 branches in the City of Manningham

<text>East Okoboji Lake is a natural body of water, approximately in area, in Dickinson County in northwest Iowa in the United States. It is part of the chain of lakes known as the Iowa Great Lakes. The area was long inhabited by the Santee or Eastern Dakota Sioux. The lake was known after its Dakota-language name, &quot;Okoboozhy&quot;, meaning reeds and rushes.

==History==
The towns of Spirit Lake and Okoboji, founded as European-American settlements in the nineteenth century, sit along its western shore. They became notable after the Spirit Lake Massacre of 1857, when a renegade band of Sioux attacked the frontier settlements, in part for food, because they were suffering starvation during a severe winter with heavy snows. It was the last Native American attack in Iowa against settlers.

==Geology==
Geologically, the lake, like its neighbors, is a glacial pothole, a remnant of the most recent ice age approximately 13,000 years ago.

The lake is shallow, with an average depth of and a maximum depth of . During the summer months, it is prone to stratification and to overgrowth with algae.

==Fishing==
The lake is a popular fishing destination in the region, for both open water and ice fishing. East and West Lake Okoboji have a healthy population of numerous species including: Black Crappie, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Largemouth Bass, Muskie, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, White Bass, Yellow Bass, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.

== Media ==
The lake was the main setting of the fourth &quot;X-Files&quot; episode, &quot;Conduit&quot;. However, the episode was filmed in British Columbia, with Buntzen Lake being used as Lake Okoboji. The lake is also depicted as being located in Sioux City in the fictitious Lake Okobogee National Park.

<text>Route 710, consisting of the non-contiguous segments of State Route 710 (SR 710) and Interstate 710 (I-710), is a major north–south state highway and auxiliary Interstate Highway in the Los Angeles metropolitan area of the U.S. state of California. Also called the Los Angeles River Freeway prior to November 18, 1954, the highway was initially planned to connect Long Beach and Pasadena, but a gap in the route exists from Alhambra to Pasadena through South Pasadena due to community opposition to its construction.

The completed southern segment is signed as I-710 and is officially known as the Long Beach Freeway, and it runs north from Long Beach to Valley Boulevard, just north of I-10 (San Bernardino Freeway), near the boundary between the cities of Alhambra and Los Angeles. South of Atlantic Boulevard at the Bell–Vernon border, I-710 follows the course of the Los Angeles River, rarely wandering more than a few hundred feet from the riverbed. South of SR 1 in Long Beach, I-710 is officially part of the Seaside Freeway.

SR 710 is the designation of the completed portion of the proposed northern extension of the route to Pasadena. This segment runs from California Boulevard in Pasadena north to its northern terminus at SR 134 and I-210. It remains unsigned, except for onramps onto the stub which are signed as onramps onto I-210 instead of SR 710. Legislation passed in 2019 authorizes its relinquishment to the City of Pasadena on or after January 1, 2024.

Prior to 1983, the road was not an Interstate, although it was built to Interstate Highway standards. Until 1964 it was State Route 15, but it was renumbered to State Route 7 in the 1964 renumbering because of the existence of I-15, and to I-710 in 1983. However, the northern stub still contains postmile markers designating such stub as both Route 7 and Route 710.

==Route description==


The California Streets and Highways Code defines Route 710 as follows: 622. Route 710 is from Route 1 to Route 210 in Pasadena.

622.1. Route 710 shall also include that portion of the freeway between Route 1 and the northern end of Harbor Scenic Drive, that portion of Harbor Scenic Drive to Ocean Boulevard, that portion of Ocean Boulevard west of its intersection with Harbor Scenic Drive to its junction with Seaside Boulevard, and that portion of Seaside Boulevard from the junction with Ocean Boulevard to Route 47.
The southern terminus of the freeway presently signed as I-710 is at Ocean Boulevard in Long Beach. From there, the Long Beach Freeway follows the course of the Los Angeles River to Atlantic Boulevard at the Bell–Vernon city limits. I-710 then travels roughly north, east of downtown Los Angeles, to its current northern terminus at Valley Boulevard (just north of I-10) in Alhambra and the El Sereno neighborhood of Los Angeles.

Near its southern terminus, I-710 separates into three spur freeways. The first spur splits at the 9th Street interchange, with the left-branching ramps crossing the Shoemaker Bridge over Los Angeles River and becoming West Shoreline Drive as they head to downtown Long Beach, passing the Aquarium of the Pacific and the Long Beach Convention Center among other attractions. This spur becomes a surface arterial at the intersection with South Chestnut Place and the Pike Parking Garage. The second spur continues south as Harbor Scenic Drive, leading to the eastern piers of the Port of Long Beach and the Queen Mary. Meanwhile, the main segment continues south as the Seaside Freeway, keeping the I-710 designation, until the interchange with Ocean Boulevard, where offramps to Ocean Boulevard west carry both the Seaside Freeway name and I-710 designation across the Long Beach International Gateway Bridge. The I-710 designation then terminates at the interchange with SR 47, while the Seaside Freeway designation continues west along with SR 47 towards the Vincent Thomas Bridge.

There is a part of Route 710 in Pasadena that is constructed to freeway standards, extending from California Boulevard north to the Foothill (I-210)/Ventura (SR 134) freeway interchange. However, the route designation on this freeway stub is unsigned, and is instead marked as if it were merely freeway entrance and exit ramps to and from I-210.

I-710 and SR 710 are part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and north of SR 1 are part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

==History==

===1930–1965===
Legislative Route 167 (LR 167) was defined in 1933 to run from San Pedro east to Long Beach and north to Monterey Park. An extension was added in 1947, taking it north to Pasadena. State Route 15 was signed in 1934 along the section of LR 167 from Pacific Coast Highway (SR 3, later U.S. Route 101 Alternate, now SR 1) in Long Beach north to Garvey Avenue (U.S. Route 99 (US 99), replaced by I-10) in Monterey Park. The original pre-freeway alignment ran along Los Robles Avenue (Pasadena) and Atlantic Boulevard. The freeway replacement of SR 15/LR 167 was built from 1953 to 1965. The whole route of LR 167, including the proposed extensions west to San Pedro and north to Pasadena, was renumbered State Route 7 in 1964, after it was decommissioned from portions of the San Diego Freeway (which is now I-405) as part of the state highway renumbering, as the number 15 conflicted with I-15 (Ironically, SR 15 still exists from I-8 to I-5 in San Diego). In 1965, the route was truncated to SR 1 in Long Beach; the part from SR 1 south and west to SR 47 was deleted, and the rest from SR 47 west to SR 11 (now I-110) became part of SR 47.

===1964–present===
The Long Beach Freeway was approved as a non-chargeable Interstate in September 1983 by the FHWA, and on May 30, 1984, AASHTO approved the SR 7 designations to be renumbered to Interstate 710. In October 1984, the FHWA approved an additional extension from CA 1 to Ocean Boulevard. The short stub in Pasadena was built in 1975, along with the adjacent sections of I-210 and SR 134. There are still remaining overhead street signs pointing motorists to SR 7 on Ford Boulevard at its intersection with Floral Drive in Monterey Park. These are the last known signs to date.

The existing freeway from SR 1 south to Ocean Boulevard was taken over by the state on August 25, 2000, in a trade with the City of Long Beach for former SR 103 north of SR 1. In 2013, Caltrans adopted the remainder of the Seaside Freeway from Ocean Boulevard to SR 47 over the Gerald Desmond Bridge as part of Route 710. Caltrans and the Port of Long Beach completed the replacement for the old Gerald Desmond Bridge in October 2020; it was named the Long Beach International Gateway Bridge in May 2021.

==Future==

===I-710 corridor project===
The significant growth of cargo volumes handled at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach has added a large amount of truck traffic to the Long Beach Freeway, since it is the most direct route between the port complex and the railyards in Vernon and East Los Angeles, as well as the Pomona and San Bernardino freeways that connect Los Angeles to railyards in San Bernardino and Colton. The freeway&#x27;s pavement has been badly damaged as a result since it was not designed to carry nearly as large of a load of truck traffic. It has also become a major source of air pollution, emanating from diesel-fueled trucks idling in rush-hour traffic congestion and giving cities along its route some of the worst air quality in already smoggy Southern California. In response, as of 2011 an Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report is being conducted to analyze possible significant improvements to I-710 between the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles and the Pomona Freeway (SR 60).

In March 2018, Caltrans considered plans to expand I-710, which would have entailed adding lanes for trucks and demolishing homes. However, this would have exacerbated the problem of air pollution around the freeway, by enabling more diesel-power trucks to travel on it. The area around the freeway is already described as a &quot;diesel death zone&quot; due to the pollution. These plans were indefinitely shelved due to public opposition.

Another potential solution to the problem is shifting freight to the Alameda Corridor. This is a freight railroad that runs parallel to I-710. Right now, 33% of freight moving to and from the Port of L.A. goes by rail.

===The South Pasadena gap===
====Overview====
The planned segment from Alhambra to Pasadena through South Pasadena has been subject to legal battles which have stopped construction. Because of these legal disputes, the freeway&#x27;s northern terminus has been Valley Boulevard since the 1960s. However, a short unsigned freeway does exist in Pasadena, heading south from the interchange of I-210 and SR 134 to California Boulevard.

As a result of the route&#x27;s incomplete condition, freeway signs are inconsistent in their identification of the northbound Long Beach Freeway&#x27;s destination, with some indicating Pasadena as a control city and others identifying Valley Boulevard as the freeway&#x27;s terminus. For example, approaching I-710 from SR 60 (Pomona Freeway) in East Los Angeles, westbound traffic is given Valley Boulevard as the destination for northbound I-710, while eastbound traffic is given a destination of Pasadena. Signs at the interchange with I-105, SR 91, and I-405 show Pasadena as the destination for northbound I-710.

Currently, traffic headed for Pasadena on I-710 is redirected to I-10 (San Bernardino Freeway) eastbound by signs at the interchange between the two routes in Monterey Park. These signs identify both Pasadena and San Bernardino as control cities for the eastbound San Bernardino Freeway, although it does not actually pass through Pasadena. Rather, traffic to the city is directed to take SR 19 (Rosemead Boulevard) northbound from its junction with I-10 (about east of the Long Beach Freeway) to reach Pasadena. Traffic from northbound I-710 is routed onto Fremont Avenue in Alhambra and South Pasadena, and the Pasadena Freeway (SR 110).

The areas around I-710, northeastern Los Angeles and the northwestern San Gabriel Valley are subject to traffic congestion. There are no completed north–south freeways in the area between I-5 (Golden State Freeway) and I-605 (San Gabriel River Freeway). Pro– and anti–I-710 lobbies have debated whether finishing I-710 would alleviate any of the San Gabriel Valley&#x27;s traffic congestion, or merely displace it from surface streets to the freeway.

====2009–2012 corridor studies====
Caltrans and its local partner, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro), researched the possibility of extending the Long Beach Freeway from Valley Boulevard to Pasadena by building a bored tunnel under Alhambra, El Sereno, and South Pasadena. The premise was that a tunnel would allow Caltrans to extend the freeway without disturbing the residential neighborhoods on the surface, similar to other tunnels throughout the world. The proposed twin tunnels would have been the longest in the United States, but were small compared with others around the world. Between January and May 2009, Caltrans conducted soil samples for the tunneling project in the Pasadena area and completed a combined environmental impact statement (EIS) and environmental impact report (EIR), in which the tunnel was one option.

In August 2012, Metro narrowed down the list of potential alternatives to study in the EIR/EIS process. The alternatives included: (1) a no-build alternative, where no additional infrastructure would be built to address the gap in the freeway plan between Valley Boulevard and I-210; (2) a roadway tunnel without exits to connect the northern terminus of the freeway at Valley Boulevard to Pasadena; (3) a light rail line connecting East L.A. with Pasadena using a route that travels along the I-710 right of way until Valley Boulevard where it would become a subway until connecting with the Metro Gold Line at the Fillmore Metro station in Pasadena; (4) a bus rapid transit line from Montebello to Pasadena; and (5) Transportation System Management/Transportation Demand Management (TSM/TDM).

====Termination====
In February 2017, California Assemblyman Chris Holden (D-Pasadena) sponsored a bill to block the completion of the I-710/I-210 gap by tunnel or other means, and his position was supported by South Pasadena and Pasadena. This unanimously led to a decision by the Los Angeles Metro authorities in May to completely defund the completion of the I-710 freeway gap between the northernmost terminus at Valley Blvd in Alhambra, to the I-210 interchange in Pasadena.

The $780 million allocated through Measure R for the intended project of closing of the gap will now be allocated to improvement of certain local surface street projects, improved traffic signal synchronizations, and other &quot;mobility improvement projects&quot;. Holden, along with State Senator Anthony Portantino introduced similar legislation, Assembly Bill 29 and Senate Bill 7 respectively, to officially delete this segment of Route 710 from the highway grid. Signed by governor Gavin Newsom in October 2019, they will take effect on January 1, 2024. Among others, the new laws authorize the maintenance of the existing portion of Route 710 between California Boulevard and the I-210/SR 134 interchange to be transferred to the City of Pasadena, and remove that segment from the California Freeway and Expressway System.

<text>The besra (Tachyspiza virgata), also called the besra sparrowhawk, is a bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. It was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Accipiter&quot;. The name &quot;besra&quot; is from the Hindi word for the species.

The besra is a widespread resident breeder in dense forests throughout southern Asia, ranging from the Indian subcontinent eastwards across Southeast Asia and into East Asia. It nests in trees, building a new nest each year. It lays 2 to 5 eggs. It is a medium-sized raptor (29 to 36 cm) with short broad wings and a long tail, both adaptations to fast maneuvering through dense vegetation. The normal flight of this species is a characteristic &quot;flap–flap–glide&quot;.

This species is like a darker version of the widespread shikra with darker upperparts, strongly barred underwing, broader gular stripe and thin long legs and toes. The adult male besra has dark blue-grey upperparts, and is white, barred reddish brown below. The larger female is browner above than the male. The juvenile is dark brown above and white, barred with brown below. In all plumages have 3-4 equally sized dark bands on uppertail.

In winter, the besra will emerge into more open woodland including savannah and cultivation. Its hunting technique is similar to other small hawks such as the sparrowhawk and the sharp-shinned hawk, relying on surprise as it flies from a hidden perch or flicks over a bush to catch its prey unaware.

The prey is lizards, dragonflies, and small birds and mammals.

==Taxonomy==
The besra was formally described and illustrated in 1822 by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck based on a specimen collected on the island of Java. He coined the binomial name &quot;Falco virgatus&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;virgatus&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;striped&quot; or &quot;streaked&quot;. The species was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Accipiter&quot;. In 2024 a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study of the Accipitridae confirmed earlier work that had shown that the genus was polyphyletic. To resolve the non-monophyly, &quot;Accipiter&quot; was divided into six genera. The genus &quot;Tachyspiza&quot; was resurrected to accommodate the besra together with 26 other species that had previously been placed in &quot;Accipiter&quot;. The resurrected genus had been introduced in 1844 by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek ταχυς (&quot;takhus&quot;) meaning &quot;fast&quot; with σπιζιας (&quot;spizias&quot;) meaning &quot;hawk&quot;. The English &quot;besra&quot; is from the Hindi word &quot;Besrā&quot; for a female besra.

Ten subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;T. v. affinis&quot; (Hodgson, 1836) – west Himalayas to central China and Indochina
* &quot;T. v. fuscipectus&quot; (Mees, 1970) – Taiwan
* &quot;T. v. besra&quot; (Jerdon, 1839) – south India and Sri Lanka
* &quot;T. v. vanbemmeli&quot; (Voous, 1950) – montane Sumatra
* &quot;T. v. rufotibialis&quot; (Sharpe, 1887) – montane Borneo
* &quot;T. v. virgata&quot; (Temminck, 1822) – montane Java and Bali
* &quot;T. v. quinquefasciata&quot; (Mees, 1984) – montane Flores (central Lesser Sunda Islands)
* &quot;T. v. abdulalii&quot; (Mees, 1981) – Andaman and Nicobar Islands
* &quot;T. v. confusa&quot; (Hartert, EJO, 1910) – north, central Philippines
* &quot;T. v. quagga&quot; (Parkes, 1973) – central, south Philippines (except Palawan group and Sulu Archipelago)
