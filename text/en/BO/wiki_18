<text>Michael Jerome Irvin (born March 5, 1966) is an American sports commentator and former professional football player. He played his entire 12-year career as a wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). In 2007, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Irvin played college football for the Miami Hurricanes and was selected in the first round of the 1988 NFL draft by the Dallas Cowboys. He spent his entire 12-year NFL career from 1988 to 1999 with the Cowboys before it ended abruptly from a cervical fracture of his spine sustained in a game against the Philadelphia Eagles at Veterans Stadium on October 10, 1999, in which Irvin was carted off the field and transported to a Philadelphia hospital.

Irvin was nicknamed &quot;the Playmaker&quot; due to his penchant for making big plays in big games during his college and pro careers, and he relished the nickname, even acquiring &quot;PLY MKR&quot; as his Texas vanity license plate. Along with Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith, Irvin was one of three key Cowboys offensive players, known as &quot;The Triplets&quot;, who led the Cowboys to three Super Bowl wins in 1992, 1993, and 1995.

Irvin is widely considered to be one of the greatest wide receivers of all time.

Irvin is a former broadcaster for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot; and currently an analyst for NFL Network. In 2009, he competed in Season 9 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and was the season&#x27;s ninth contestant to be eliminated.

He is one of the co-hosts of the FS1 weekday debate show &quot;Speak&quot; with Paul Pierce, Keyshawn Johnson, and Joy Taylor.

==Early life==
Irvin was born March 5, 1966, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He is the 15th of 17 children in his family. Irvin first attended Piper High School in Sunrise, Florida, and then went on to become a football star at St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale.

While at St. Thomas Aquinas High School, Irvin was heavily recruited by the University of Miami to play for the Miami Hurricanes, one of the top collegiate football programs in the nation.

==College career==
At the University of Miami under coach Jimmy Johnson, Irvin set school records for the Miami Hurricanes for career receptions (143), receiving yards (2,423 and later broken by Santana Moss), and touchdown receptions (26). He was a member of the University of Miami&#x27;s 1987 national championship team and made one of the most legendary plays in school history that year, scoring on a 73-yard fourth-quarter touchdown pass from Steve Walsh that provided the margin of victory in Miami&#x27;s victory over archrival Florida State, which propelled them into the national championship game, the 1988 Orange Bowl, against the top-ranked Oklahoma Sooners.

Irvin was selected three times as an All-American by the Newspaper Enterprise Association, earning second-team honors as a freshman, first-team as a sophomore, and second-team again as a junior.

In 1988, following his junior year at the University of Miami, Irvin announced he was skipping his final year of college eligibility and declaring his eligibility for the 1988 NFL draft.

===College statistics===
*1985: 46 catches for 840 yards and 9 TD.
*1986: 53 catches for 868 yards and 11 TD.
*1987: 44 catches for 715 yards and 6 TD. 2 carries for 4 yards.

==Professional career==
=== 1988 draft selection ===
Irvin was selected by the Dallas Cowboys as the 11th pick in the first round of the 1988 NFL draft. He was the last first-round draft pick made by the Cowboys under the leadership of long-time general manager Tex Schramm, player personnel director Gil Brandt, and head coach Tom Landry. Schramm predicted that Irvin would accelerate the Cowboys&#x27; &quot;return to the living&quot;.

As a rookie in the 1988 season, Irvin became the first rookie receiver in Cowboys&#x27; history to start a season opener in 20 years. In the opening game of his rookie season against the Pittsburgh Steelers at Three Rivers Stadium on September 3, 1988, Irvin caught his first NFL career touchdown. He also caught three touchdown passes in the Cowboys&#x27; win over the Washington Redskins on December 11, 1988, at RFK Stadium, which represented one of only three wins in the Cowboys&#x27; 3–13 1988 season, which was the final season of Landry&#x27;s career. For the season, Irvin led the NFC in average yards per catch with a 20.4 yard average per catch.

=== 1989 and 1990 seasons ===
In 1989, the Cowboys hired Jimmy Johnson, Irvin&#x27;s coach at the University of Miami, to replace Landry. The Cowboys&#x27; misfortunes continued in 1989, and they finished the season with a 1–15 record, the worst season record in Cowboys franchise history. Injuries limited Irvin to only six games during the season. He had been on pace to gain over 1,000 receiving yards until tearing his anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in a game against the San Francisco 49ers on October 15, 1989, after which he was placed on the injured reserve list for the rest of the 1989 season and the first three games of the 1990 season.

In 1990, Irvin did not register his first reception until the seventh game and finished the season with just 20 receptions for 413 yards, but also averaged 20.7 yards per catch.

Before the injury, Irvin was nearly traded to the Los Angeles Raiders to help bring talent to the Cowboys and potentially pair Irvin up with Tim Brown, but Raiders owner Al Davis essentially talked Johnson out of the trade by saying, &quot;You sure you want to do that? Who is going to catch passes for you?&quot; Johnson instead traded Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings in what would come to be known as the Herschel Walker trade. One factor in Irvin almost being traded was that then-offensive coordinator David Shula thought Irvin was slow and not a team player. When the Cowboys fired Shula and replaced him with Norv Turner, the notion of trading Irvin became nonexistent in part because Turner believed Irvin would become a superstar in his system.

=== 1991 season ===
In 1991, Irvin was a major factor in the Cowboys reaching the playoffs. He finished the season with 93 receptions (second in the NFL for the season), 1,523 receiving yards (first in the NFL for the season), eight receiving touchdowns, and set a Cowboys franchise record with seven 100-yard games. Irvin was named to the 1991 Pro Bowl, the first of five consecutive seasons in which he was selected to Pro Bowls.

==== 1992 and 1993 seasons ====

In 1992 and 1993, Irvin was a key player on the Cowboys&#x27; Super Bowl teams. In 1994, he enjoyed another stellar campaign with his fourth consecutive Pro Bowl season, but that year the Cowboys lost to the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game. For his part, however, Irvin had one of the most productive games in NFL playoff history, with 12 catches for an NFC championship record 192 yards and two touchdowns.

One of his greatest performances was in Super Bowl XXVII (1993), where he caught six passes for 114 yards and two touchdowns. His two touchdowns were scored in the second quarter and occurred in a span of just 18 seconds, the fastest pair of touchdowns ever scored by one player in Super Bowl history. He also became only the second player ever to score 2 touchdowns in one quarter of a Super Bowl, after Washington Redskins wide receiver Ricky Sanders in Super Bowl XXII.

=== 1994 to 1996 ===
Irvin was a key contributor in the Cowboys&#x27; victories in Super Bowl XXVIII in 1993 over the Buffalo Bills and Super Bowl XXX in 1995 over the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the 1993 Super Bowl against the Bills, Irvin recorded five receptions for 66 yards. In the 1995 Super Bowl against the Steelers, he had five receptions for 76 yards.

Irvin&#x27;s best season with the Cowboys was 1995 during which he set franchise records for receptions (111) and receiving yards (1,603) while scoring 10 touchdowns and setting an NFL record with 11 games with over 100 receiving yards. Irvin had seven receptions for 100 yards and two touchdowns against the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game, which led the Cowboys to Super Bowl XXX, the team&#x27;s third Super Bowl win in a span of four seasons.

Irvin is the only player to play for each of the first four Cowboys coaches since the team has been owned by Jerry Jones (Landry, Johnson, Barry Switzer, and Chan Gailey). Irvin officially announced his retirement after Dave Campo became the fifth Cowboys coach, but never played on the field for Campo.

=== 1997 and 1998 seasons ===
After recovering from his collar bone injury, Irvin returned to have solid years in 1997 and 1998.

=== Career-ending injury ===
During the fifth game of the 1999 season, Irvin was tackled by Philadelphia Eagles defensive back Tim Hauck and was driven head-first into the turf at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia. He sustained a non-life-threatening cervical spine injury, but was carted off the field and transported to the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. Irvin did not play again that season. Doctors subsequently discovered Irwin had been born with cervical spinal stenosis. Doctors told Irvin that this condition put him at higher risk for injury, including paralysis, if he suffered another blow to the neck or head. After being advised to stop playing football, Irvin announced his retirement in May 2000.

Irvin was the last Tom Landry-coached player to retire from the NFL. Landry died on February 12, 2000, several months after Irvin&#x27;s injury in Philadelphia but before Irvin had announced that he was retiring due to the severity of that injury.

==Records and honors==
===University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame===
In 2000, Irvin was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame.

===NFL records===
Irvin finished his career with 750 receptions (tied with Charlie Joiner for 30th all-time in the NFL) for 11,904 yards (21st all-time in the NFL) and 65 touchdowns. His 47 100-yard receiving games is eighth-most in NFL history, tied with Torry Holt. Irvin was selected to five Pro Bowls (two more than any other wide receiver in franchise history) and was named the MVP of the 1992 Pro Bowl (following the 1991 season) after catching eight passes for 125 yards and a touchdown in the NFC&#x27;s 21–15 triumph. Irvin was a key playmaker for the Dallas Cowboys that won 6 division titles and three Super Bowls.

As part of Dallas&#x27; starting lineup on offense, Irvin was a consistent force to be reckoned with in the regular season but also excelled in the playoffs, where his six career 100-yard receiving games are just two shy of the NFL record held by Jerry Rice, who had eight such games. Irvin&#x27;s 87 postseason receptions place him second in NFL playoff history behind Rice, who had 151, and Irvin&#x27;s 1,315 post-season receiving yards ranks second to Rice, who recorded 2,245 post-season yards.

From 1991 through 1998, Irvin recorded 1,000-yard seasons in all but one year, racking up an impressive 10,292 yards over an eight-year span. Along the way, the Cowboys made four straight appearances in the NFC Championship Game (1992–1995) and captured three Super Bowl championships with back-to-back wins over the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVII and Super Bowl XXVIII, and the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XXX.

===Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor===
Along with his former teammates Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith, Irvin was inducted into the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor on September 19, 2005.

===Texas Sports Hall of Fame===
Irvin was one of three former NFL players with Cowboys ties selected for induction into the 2007 class of the Texas Sports Hall of Fame, all of whom were inducted at a February 2008 ceremony in Waco, Texas. The other two were Jim Ray Smith of the Cleveland Browns, who finished his career with the Cowboys (1963–64), and Ray Childress, a five-time Pro Bowl defensive end for the Houston Oilers who wrapped up his NFL career with the Cowboys in 1996.

===Florida All-Century Team===
In 2007, Irvin was named to the Florida High School Athletic Association&#x27;s All-Century Team that listed the Top 33 football players in the state of Florida&#x27;s 100-year history of high school football.

===Pro Football Hall of Fame===
Irvin became eligible for induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005. He was selected in his third year of eligibility, on February 3, 2007, alongside Gene Hickerson, Bruce Matthews, Thurman Thomas, Charlie Sanders, and Roger Wehrli. He was formally inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame during the Hall of Fame&#x27;s August 4, 2007, induction ceremony in Canton, Ohio.

On August 4, 2007, Irvin was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, delivering a tearful acceptance speech in which he referenced both his life as a football player and the many mistakes he has made in his life. His speech has been praised by many NFL commentators as heartfelt, including those who had been inclined to dislike him.

On October 14, 2007, Irvin accepted his Hall of Fame ring at Texas Stadium during halftime of the Cowboys–New England Patriots game. In his speech, he proposed to Commissioner Roger Goodell that all drafted rookies will have a tour of the Pro Football Hall of Fame to better understand their football history.

==Legacy==
At 6&#x27;2&quot; and 207 pounds, Irvin was a big, physical receiver who manhandled cornerbacks and often was able to make tough catches in defensive traffic. In part because of Irvin&#x27;s ability to push off the defender with such ease, the NFL eventually changed its rules to adjust to wide receivers who emulated Irvin&#x27;s physical style.

Irvin was a vocal, emotional leader who set every significant career receiving mark in Cowboys history, including catches and receiving yards. At the time of his retirement, he owned or was tied for 20 team receiving records. In November 2008, his Cowboys teammate Daryl Johnston said, &quot;Michael was the hardest working guy on our team. He was a guy who made some wrong decisions, but he never took anything public, and he never spoke out against anyone on our team. He wasn&#x27;t a problem. He was more of an inspiration.&quot;

Irvin has high regard for players from &quot;The U,&quot; as he likes to call the University of Miami, including Frank Gore, Edgerrin James, and others.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Irvin has been married to Sandy Harrell since 1990. They have a daughter and two sons together. Irvin also has another daughter from a previous relationship.

===Religion===
Irvin is a Christian. He has said, “I turned my life over to Christ in early 2001 with help from Pastor T.D. Jakes and my friend and fellow believer, Deion Sanders. It took me forty years to really realize the hand that God had on me. I did almost every bad thing you could do, but it&#x27;s through the power of God I can live this life.”

==Allegations==
===Fabricated sexual assault allegation against Irvin===
In 1996, as the Cowboys prepared to play the Carolina Panthers in the NFC Divisional Playoff game, media reports stated that Irvin and teammate Erik Williams, while under the influence of cocaine, had sexually assaulted a Dallas Cheerleader, Nina Shahravan, and, with a gun to her head, videotaped the interaction.

Despite Williams&#x27; and Irvin&#x27;s denials of the allegations, the story largely overshadowed the game, which the Cowboys lost. The accuser was later proven to have fabricated the entire incident. She recanted her story, pled guilty to perjury and filing a false police report, and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and a fine. In the game against Carolina, Irvin was injured in the opening minutes and did not return.

===1998 scissorgate===
On July 29, 1998, Irvin allegedly assaulted fellow Cowboys offensive lineman Everett McIver. The initial dispute stemmed from Irvin demanding that McIver vacate a barber&#x27;s chair so that Irvin would not have to wait for a haircut. McIver and Irvin soon began a brawl in the shop with fellow Cowboy Leon Lett attempting to break it up.

During the course of the dispute, Irvin grabbed a pair of scissors and stabbed McIver in the neck, barely missing his carotid artery. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones reportedly brokered a six-figure settlement between Irvin and McIver in exchange for McIver&#x27;s silence and to prevent McIver from pursuing criminal charges against Irvin.

===Arrests===
In June 2001, a year following his NFL retirement, Irvin was arrested for felony cocaine possession. Irvin was in a Dallas apartment with an unrelated woman, and neither answered the door when police drug task force agents arrived with a search warrant. Police then entered the apartment forcibly, finding drugs. Irvin and the woman were placed under arrest, though charges against Irvin were later dropped.

On November 25, 2005, Irvin was pulled over in Plano, Texas, for speeding. Irvin was arrested on an outstanding warrant for an unpaid speeding ticket in Irving, Texas, and was also cited for misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia after police searched his car and found a pipe and plastic bags with marijuana residue. Irvin was arrested for a Class C misdemeanor, and was later released on bond.

On December 1, 2005, in response to his arrest, ESPN suspended Irvin for the Sunday and Monday night &quot;Countdown&quot; shows on December 4 and 5, 2005. He returned to both shows with no mention or consequence of the past incident.

===2007 sexual assault allegation===
On July 4, 2007, Irvin was accused of sexual assault while he was at the Seminole Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood, Florida. Charges were never filed, but a civil suit was filed against him in 2010. Irvin filed a $100million defamation countersuit, which was dropped when the case was settled out of court in January 2011.

===Victim of alleged 2009 carjacking attempt===
On January 12, 2009, Irvin claimed he was a victim of a possible carjacking attempt while stopped at a light in Dallas. He filed a police report claiming that two men flashed a gun at him but eventually drove away after commenting that they were Cowboys fans. Dallas police suspended their investigation two weeks later, stating that Irvin did not cooperate in the investigation and that they could not proceed without his cooperation.

===2017 sexual assault investigation===

On March 22, 2017, Fort Lauderdale police investigated Irvin for allegedly sexually assaulting a woman in Florida. Irvin denied the allegations. On July 24, the Broward County State Attorney&#x27;s Office announced they had closed the investigation and would not charge Irvin in the case.

===Super Bowl LVII alleged misconduct===
NFL Network removed Irvin from its coverage of Super Bowl LVII in February 2023 after allegations of sexual misconduct toward a woman at his hotel in the Phoenix area. Though surveillance video showed him interacting with the woman, Irvin told a Dallas-Fort Worth radio station that he had no recollection of any incident because he had been intoxicated. He also denied there was any wrongdoing.

===Statements===
In a November 2006 radio interview on Dan Patrick&#x27;s radio show, Irvin joked that Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo&#x27;s athletic ability may have been due to African-American heritage and jokingly remarked that Romo&#x27;s maternal relatives might have been involved with &quot;slave brothers&quot;. Irvin later apologized and said, &quot;this is how I joke around with Romo when we&#x27;re playing basketball. There&#x27;s a difference from me the player and me the broadcaster&quot;.

On February 17, 2007, during the late edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, ESPN announced that Irvin was no longer with the network. ESPN Communications Vice President Josh Krulewitz said, &quot;We thank Michael for his contributions to ESPN and wish him well.&quot; However, eleven months later, in January 2008, Irvin rejoined ESPN as a host on ESPN Radio owned and operation station KESN (103.3 FM) in Dallas, hosting &quot;The Michael Irvin Show&quot;. This locally aired program ended on February 5, 2010, and Irvin was let go after his contract expired. An ESPN spokesman cited declining ratings and that news of a lawsuit filed against Irvin for a 2007 incident &quot;simply expedited the situation&quot;.

On a February 2017 episode of &quot;The Rich Eisen Show&quot;, Irvin admitted to having snuck out of the locker room during halftime of Super Bowl XXVII to watch Michael Jackson perform.

==Entertainment career==

Irvin was a co-star in the 2005 remake of &quot;The Longest Yard&quot;, starring Adam Sandler and Chris Rock. Irvin also guest starred in Sandler&#x27;s film &quot;Jack &amp; Jill&quot;, which was released on November 11, 2011. He was one of the &quot;Pros&quot; on an episode of &quot;Pros vs. Joes&quot;, which pitted former professional athletes against average people. He was the host of &quot;4th and Long&quot;, a football-themed reality series which aired on Spike TV. The winner, Jesse Holley, earned a spot at the Dallas Cowboys&#x27; training camp. Irvin had a supporting role in the 2017 basketball drama &quot;Slamma Jamma&quot; as a sleazy sports agent.

In 2011, Irvin spoke to &quot;Out&quot; magazine about his homosexual older brother, who died of stomach cancer in 2006. He claimed his initial feelings of homophobia in relation to his brother led to womanizing during his playing days but eventual acceptance and feelings of love toward his older brother initiated his understanding for people with difficulty sharing their circumstances.

In August 2011, officials from the Elite Football League of India announced that Irvin would be among the primary investors and advisers for the league. Other prominent backers included former Chicago Bears head coach Mike Ditka, former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Ron Jaworski, and NFL linebacker Brandon Chillar.

In July 2023, management from Asset Entities announced that Irvin would be among the primary investors and advisers for the company. Other prominent backers included TRITON FUNDS.

<doc id="449876" wikidata="Q252801" url="?curid=449876" title="Kanō school">
<text>The  is one of the most famous schools of Japanese painting. The Kanō school of painting was the dominant style of painting from the late 15th century until the Meiji period which began in 1868, by which time the school had divided into many different branches. The Kanō family itself produced a string of major artists over several generations, to which large numbers of unrelated artists who trained in workshops of the school can be added. Some artists married into the family and changed their names, and others were adopted. According to the historian of Japanese art Robert Treat Paine, &quot;another family which in direct blood line produced so many men of genius ... would be hard to find&quot;.

The school began by reflecting a renewed influence from Chinese painting, but developed a brightly coloured and firmly outlined style for large panels decorating the castles of the nobility which reflected distinctively Japanese traditions, while continuing to produce monochrome brush paintings in Chinese styles. It was supported by the shogunate, effectively representing an official style of art, which &quot;in the 18th century almost monopolized the teaching of painting&quot;. It drew on the Chinese tradition of literati painting by scholar-bureaucrats, but the Kanō painters were firmly professional artists, very generously paid if successful, who received a formal workshop training in the family workshop, in a similar way to European painters of the Renaissance or Baroque. They worked mainly for the nobility, &quot;shōguns&quot; and emperors, covering a wide range of styles, subjects and formats. Initially innovative, and largely responsible for the new types of painting of the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573–1600), from the 17th century the artists of the school became increasingly conservative and academic in their approach. 
==Early period==
The school was founded by the very long-lived Kanō Masanobu (1434–1530), who was the son of Kagenobu, a samurai and amateur painter. Masanobu was a contemporary of Sesshū (1420–1506), a leader of the revival of Chinese influence, who had actually visited China in mid-career, in around 1467. Sesshū may have been a student of Shūbun, recorded from about 1414 (as an apprentice) and 1465, another key figure in the revival of Chinese idealist traditions in Japanese painting. Masanobu began his career in Shūbun&#x27;s style, and works are recorded between 1463 and 1493. He was appointed court artist to the Muromachi government, and his works evidently included landscape ink wash paintings in a Chinese style, as well as figure paintings and birds and flowers. Few works certainly from his hand survive; they include a large screen with a crane in a snowy landscape in the &quot;Shinju-an&quot;, a sub-temple of &quot;Daitoku-ji&quot;. Masanobu&#x27;s Chinese-style &quot;Zhou Maoshu Appreciating Lotuses&quot; in the Kyushu National Museum (illustrated left) is a National Treasure of Japan.

Masanobu trained his sons Kanō Motonobu (1476–1559) and the younger Yukinobu (or Utanosuke). Motonobu is usually credited with establishing the school&#x27;s distinctive technique and style, or rather different styles, which brought a firmer line and stronger outlines to paintings using Chinese conventions. Less interest was taken in subtle effects of atmospheric recession that in the Chinese models, and elements in the composition tend to be placed at the front of the picture space, often achieving decorative effects in a distinctively Japanese way. Motonobu married the daughter of Tosa Mitsunobu, the head of the Tosa school, which continued the classic Japanese yamato-e style of largely narrative and religious subjects, and Kanō paintings subsequently also included more traditional Japanese subjects typical of that school.

==Castle decoration==
The school was instrumental in developing new forms of painting for decorating the new styles of castles of the new families of &quot;daimyōs&quot; (feudal lords) that emerged in the struggles of the Azuchi–Momoyama period of civil war that ended with the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603. The new lords had risen to power by military skill, and mostly lacked immersion in the sophisticated traditions of Japanese culture long cultivated in Buddhist monasteries and the Imperial court. Bold and vigorous styles using bright colour on a gold ground (background in gold leaf or paint) appealed to the taste of these patrons, and were applied to large folding screens (&quot;byōbu&quot;) and sets of sliding doors (&quot;fusuma&quot;). In the grandest rooms most of the walls were painted, although interrupted by wooden beams, with some designs continuing regardless of these. Very many examples in castles have been lost to fires, whether accidental or caused in war, but others were painted for monasteries, or given to them from castles, which if they survived World War II bombing have had a better chance of survival.

Common subjects were landscapes, often as a background for animals and dragons, or birds, trees or flowers, or compositions with a few large figures, but crowded panoramic scenes from a high viewpoint were also painted. The animals and plants shown often had moral or perhaps political significance that is not always obvious today; the Chinese-style ink wash scroll by Kanō Eitoku of &quot;Chao Fu and his Ox&quot;, illustrated in the gallery below, illustrates a Chinese legend and contains a &quot;Confucian moral [which] points to the dangers inherent in political position&quot;, a very topical message for Japan in the period following the disruptive civil wars caused by naked political ambition.

Some of the most famous examples of castle decoration can be found at the Nijō Castle in Kyoto. In 1588 the warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi is said to have assembled a walkway between 100 painted screens as the approach to a flower party. That, unlike scrolls, sliding doors were by convention not signed, and screens only rarely, considerably complicates the business of attributing works to painters who were able to paint in several styles. At the same time the school continued to paint monochrome ink-on-silk landscapes for hanging scrolls in the Chinese tradition, as well as other types of subjects such as portraits. The types of scrolls were both vertical for hanging, with a backing usually of thick woven silk, the traditional Chinese format which became the most common in Japan in this period (&quot;kakemono&quot; in Japanese), and in the long horizontal handscroll (&quot;emakimono&quot;) format as used for books. Many screens and doors were also painted in monochrome, especially for monasteries, and scrolls were also painted in full colour. Kanō ink painters composed very flat pictures but they balanced impeccably detailed realistic depictions of animals and other subjects in the foreground with abstract, often entirely blank, clouds and other background elements. The use of negative space to indicate distance, and to imply mist, clouds, sky or sea is drawn from traditional Chinese modes and is used beautifully by the Kanō artists. Bold brush strokes and thus bold images are obtained in what is often a very subtle and soft medium. These expertly painted monochrome ink paintings contrast with the almost gaudy but no less beautiful gold-on-paper forms these artists created for walls and screens.

===Cypress screen by Eitoku===
This eight panel screen attributed to Eitoku, around 1590, shows the vigour of the new Momoyama castle style, which he is probably mainly responsible for developing. It is a National Treasure of Japan in the Tokyo National Museum, and described by Paine as &quot;typical for hurried sweep of composition, for pure nature design, and for strength of individual brush stroke. ... Golden cloud-like areas representing mist are placed arbitrarily in the background, and emphasize the decorative magnitude of what is otherwise the powerful drawing of giant tree forms&quot;.

The screen is unusually large and there are noticeable discontinuities in the composition at the breaks between (counting from the left) panels 2 and 3, 4 and 5, 6 and 7. These reflect the original format as a set of four sliding doors, which can be deduced from this and the covered-over recesses for the door-pulls. The discontinuities would be much less obvious when the screen was standing in a zig-zag pattern, as would normally have been the case. The screen uses the &quot;floating-cloud&quot; convention of much older Yamato-e Japanese art, where areas the artist chooses not to represent are hidden beneath solid colour (here gold) representing mist. Designs of this type, dominated by a single massive tree, became a common composition in the school, and this one can be compared to the similar screen of a plum tree by Sanretsu from a few decades later (illustrated below), which shows a more restrained version of the first bold Momoyama style.

==Height of influence and decline==
Kanō Eitoku (1543–1590), a grandson of Motonobu and probably his pupil, was the most important painter of this generation, and is believed to have been the first to use a gold-leaf background in large paintings. He appears to have been the main figure in developing the new castle style, but while his importance is fairly clear there are few if any certain attributions to him, especially to his hand alone; in the larger works attributed to him he probably worked together with one of more other artists of the school. Despite having two painter sons, at the suggestion (if not the order) of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Eitoku adopted Kanō Sanraku (1561–1635), who married his daughter and succeeded him as head of the school. Sanraku&#x27;s works (two illustrated here) at their best combine the forceful quality of Momoyama work with the tranquil depiction of nature and more refined use of colour typical of the Edo period. When Sanraku had no son he married Kanō Sansetsu (1589–1651) to his daughter and adopted him. Sansetsu and his school remained in Kyoto when most Kanō artists moved to Edo (often after a summons from the &quot;shōgun&quot;), and he continued to adhere to the brightly coloured style of the Momoyama period. His son Einō painted in the same style, but is better known for a biographical history of Japanese painting, which gave the Kanō school pride of place.

The range of forms, styles and subjects that were established in the early 17th century continued to be developed and refined without major innovation for the next two centuries, and although the Kanō school was the most successful in Japan, the distinctions between the work of it and other schools tended to diminish, as all the schools worked in a range of styles and formats, making the attribution of unsigned works often unclear. The Kanō school split into different branches in Kyoto and the new capital of Edo, which had three for much of this period: the Kajibashi, Nakabashi and Kobikicho, named after their locations in Edo.

The last of the &quot;three famous brushes&quot; of the school, with Motonobu and Eitoku, was Kanō Tan&#x27;yū (originally named Morinobu, 1602–1674), who was recognised as an outstanding talent as a child, attending an audience with the &quot;shōgun&quot; at the age of 10, and receiving a good official appointment in 1617. He was Eitoku&#x27;s grandson through his second son Kanō Takanobu (1572–1618), also a significant painter; Tan&#x27;yū&#x27;s brother Yasunobu was adopted into the main line of the family. Tan&#x27;yū headed the Kajibashi branch of the school in Edo and painted in many castles and the Imperial palace, in a less bold but extremely elegant style, which however tended to become stiff and academic in the hands of less-talented imitators. The best Kanō artists continued to work mostly for the nobility, with increasingly stultified versions of the style and subject-matter already established, but other Kanō-trained artists worked for the new urban merchant class, and in due course moved into the new form of the ukiyo-e print. Hiroshige is among the ukiyo-e artists whose work shows influence from the Kanō school. Despite the loss of official patronage with the Meiji period, artists continued to work in the Kanō style until the early 20th century. Kanō Shōsen&#x27;in, who died in 1880, was a descendant of the main line of the family. One late follower of the school was Kanō Kazunobu (1816–1853), who adopted the name as a sign of his respect, and painted a series of large scrolls of the &quot;500 Arhats&quot; which has recently received a revival of attention after being hidden away since World War II.

==National Treasures==

A number of paintings by the schools that are still in Japan are included in the official List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings). From the 15th century Azuchi–Momoyama period come the Chinese-style hanging scroll &quot;Zhou Maoshu Appreciating Lotuses&quot; by Kanō Masanobu (illustrated above), and a six-section screen by Kanō Hideyori of &quot;Maple Viewers&quot;, an early Kanō example of Yamato-e subject matter. From the Momoyama period there is a set of room decorations on walls, doors and screens by Kanō Eitoku and his father Shōei, in the Jukō-in (abbot&#x27;s lodging) at the Daitoku-ji monastery in Kyoto; this includes the doors with &quot;Birds and flowers of the four seasons&quot; illustrated here. Also by Eitoku is the screen with a Cypress tree in the Tokyo National Museum, discussed and illustrated above, and a pair of six panel screens showing crowded panoramic views of &quot;Scenes in and around the capital&quot; in a museum in Yonezawa, Yamagata. By Kanō Naganobu there is a pair of screens (less two sections lost in an earthquake in 1923) showing relatively large figures &quot;Merry-making under aronia blossoms&quot;, also in the Tokyo National Museum. Other artists with works on the list, for example Hasegawa Tōhaku (16th century) and Maruyama Ōkyo (19th century), were trained by the school or otherwise influenced by it. Many other works by the school have received the lower designation of Important Cultural Properties of Japan.

== Artists ==
The following list is an incomplete group of major figures of their day, mostly from the Kanō family itself; there were many other artists named Kanō who retained links with the various family workshops, and still more who trained in one of these before continuing their careers independently:

== The Kanō family ==
The Kanō family of painters was founded by Kanō Masanobu (1434–1530). Through his father, Kanō Kagenobu, Masanobu is said to be a descendant of Kanō Muneshige, a samurai of the Kamakura period of the Kanō clan. Through this lineage, the Kanō family would descend from the Fujiwara clan through the Kudō clan.

<text>Robert Seagren (born October 17, 1946) is a retired American pole vaulter, the 1968 Olympic champion.

A native of Pomona, California, Seagren was one of the world&#x27;s top pole vaulters in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He won six National AAU and four NCAA titles indoors and outdoors. Indoors he posted eight world bests between 1966 and 1969. He was also the Pan American Games champion in 1967. He set his first world record in Fresno on May 14, 1966, followed by his world records 1967 in San Diego , 1968 in Echo Summit near South Lake Tahoe and 1972 in Eugene .

In 1968, Seagren participated in his first Olympic Games in Mexico City. In an exciting contest, he won the gold medal with the top three vaulters, including silver medalist Claus Schiprowski (West Germany) and the bronze medal winner Wolfgang Nordwig (East Germany) reaching the same height .

Four years later, in Munich, he remains best remembered for the Olympic gold medal he didn&#x27;t get. In the 1972 Summer Olympics, a last-minute ruling barred the new &quot;banana-Pole&quot; from Olympic competition, forcing some vaulters, including Seagren, to compete with unfamiliar poles. East German Wolfgang Nordwig didn&#x27;t use a &quot;Cata-Pole&quot; and won the gold medal, with Seagren coming second. It was the first time an American had failed to win the Olympic gold medal in the pole vault. In fact, no American would again win a gold medal in the pole vault until Nick Hysong won in 2000.

A 1968 University of Southern California graduate, Seagren took a try at professional track and later he started his career in television and movies as a show host and soap opera actor. He was also taken in the 1967 ABA Draft by the New Orleans Buccaneers, despite never having played basketball at any level.

Seagren won the inaugural American &quot;Superstars&quot; sports competition in 1973 as well as the first &quot;World Superstars&quot; in 1977, his lone victories in both events. He was able to enjoy the spoils from these competitions because he had become a professional athlete having signed to join the International Track Association (ITA) tour after the 1972 Olympics. On the ITA tour he renewed his very personal antagonistic rivalry with fellow American pole vaulter Steve Smith.

Seagren went on to become an actor, appearing in several movies and television shows, including the controversial sitcom &quot;Soap&quot; in 1977 in which he played Dennis Phillips, a gay football player in a relationship with Billy Crystal&#x27;s character Jodie Dallas. He appeared as a guest star in an episode of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; in 1980, called &quot;Toni&#x27;s Boys&quot; as a detective who worked for a friend of Charlie who was also in the detective business. The episode was a backdoor pilot for a new series but the show wasn&#x27;t picked up by the network. He was referred to in the episode as an &quot;Olympic Champion&quot; although he played a fictional character. He also guest starred on the TV series &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; in the episodes called &quot;Stolen Faces&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Could Not Die&quot;. Seagren played himself, serving as an LAPD youth camp counselor on the &quot;Camp Two&quot; episode of &quot;Adam-12&quot;.

Today, he is CEO of International City Racing, which specializes in the development, management, and implementation of road racing, endurance, and fitness events, including the Long Beach International City Marathon. He is also an active supporter of the Commission on Athletics of the California Community Colleges.

He was named to the inaugural class of the Mt. SAC Relays Hall of Fame. In 1986 he was inducted into the USATF National Track and Field Hall of Fame.

He was married to actress and Playboy Playmate of the month (January 1990) Peggy McIntaggart, and they had twins (a boy and a girl), McKenzie and Mika Seagren, born in 1997.

<text>In telecommunications, directory assistance or directory inquiries is a phone service used to find out a specific telephone number and/or address of a residence, business, or government entity.

==Technology==
Directory assistance systems incorporate a wide range of automation to reduce the cost of human operators. Almost all systems use custom database software to locate listings quickly.

Most directory assistance systems use automated readback systems to give out the phone number. This frees the directory assistance operator to move on to another caller as soon as the correct listing is located.

Some systems have &quot;store and forward&quot; technology which records the city and state the caller is requesting; it then plays the recording to the operator before they answer and ask the caller to further specify.

Interactive voice response systems have been added to many directory assistance systems. These complex systems use speech recognition and recorded speech or speech synthesis to handle the entire call without live operator intervention.

Most systems recognize location and listing. If recognition confidence is high, the best result is played to the caller. If confidence is low, the caller&#x27;s request is played back to a live operator, who locates the correct listing.

==North America==
In the North American Numbering Plan (covering Canada, the United States, and parts of the Caribbean), directory assistance may be contacted by dialing 411 (one of the N11 codes). To get a listing in a remote or non-local area code, directory assistance is available at 1-&quot;area code&quot;-555-1212. In some cases, a 411 call from a landline will yield local, national, and sometimes international listings.

Most telephone companies permit up to two listings per 411 calls. All wireless carriers offer nationwide listings with 411 except Xfinity Mobile, and some offer additional Enhanced Directory Assistance services. However, wireless numbers for residential customers are not available via 411.
In 2021, AT&amp;T ended directory assistance service for wireless subscribers and in 2023 ended directory assistance services for digital landline subscribers, AT&amp;T&#x27;s directory assistance listings are now inaccessible as of 2024.

===Billing===
Historically, the tariffs for wireline telephone service allowed subscribers to place a certain number of directory assistance calls for free each month. More recently, telephone companies are charging subscribers for every directory assistance call.

U.S. wireline telephone companies classify DA into four rate classes:

# 411 LDA: Local Directory Assistance. 411 is dialed, and the operator is requested to search for a listing in a group of area codes local to the caller (LATA). Example: the caller lives in area code 630 (Oak Brook, Illinois) and requests a listing for a business in area code 312 (Chicago, Illinois). In this case, AT&amp;T Illinois bills the call.
# 411 NDA: National Directory Assistance. 411 is dialed and the operator is requested to search for a listing in an area code not local to the caller. For example: The caller lives in area code 630 (Oak Brook, Illinois) and requests a listing for a business in area code 213 (Los Angeles, California). In this case, AT&amp;T Illinois bills the call.
# (area code) 555–1212: National Directory Assistance. This example assumes the caller is in Oak Brook, Illinois (area code 630) and uses Verizon as their long-distance carrier. Example: The caller is looking for a listing in Los Angeles, California (area code 213) and dials 213-555-1212. In this case, Verizon bills the call.
# 00 and ask for the international directory assistance operator. AT&amp;T provides International Directory Assistance calls.

===Toll-free directory assistance===
In the U.S., directory assistance for companies with toll-free &quot;800 numbers&quot; (with area codes 800, 833, 844, 855, 866, 877, and 888) was available from toll-free directory assistance, reachable by dialing 1-800-555-1212, for many decades until it was discontinued in 2020.

Toll-free directory assistance was provided by telecommunication providers, namely AT&amp;T and Verizon, as mandated by the Federal Communications Commission. Companies requested to have their toll-free number listed, and paid the providers each time their phone number was released to a toll-free directory-assistance caller.

In 1999, AT&amp;T applied for permission to discontinue this service, but it remained active until the summer of 2020. An automated disconnection recording now plays when calling the 1-800-555-1212 number.

===Directory assistance data sources===
The service of 411 queries is often outsourced to a call centre that specializes in that function. Historically, when a single carrier provided most of the telephony services for a region, the data used to satisfy the search could come exclusively from that carrier&#x27;s subscriber rolls. Today, when the market is fragmented amongst many carriers, the data must be aggregated by a data aggregator specializing in directory listings. The data aggregator distributes the data to the 411 services either on a &quot;live&quot; basis, actually servicing each query, or by periodically transferring large swaths of listings to the call center&#x27;s systems for local searching.

The data aggregator collects the data from the rolls of many telecommunication carriers. Some carriers, such as Vonage, do not send their customer rolls to the aggregator.

===Companies specializing in free directory assistance===
Private companies have entered the directory assistance market by offering free directory assistance. They are available in most states like Connecticut and others. Customers often must listen to an advertisement prior to receiving directory services.

==Australia==
In Australia, there are two standard directory assistance numbers that can be accessed from any phone provider; these are 1223 for national directory assistance and 1225 for international directory assistance. Other directory service numbers are carrier specific and can only be accessed by customers of that particular provider. For example, Sensis on 1234 is a premium operator-assist directory service that only certain Telstra customers are able to access. Other operator-assist directory services do exist, for example, CallConnect on 12456; however, these numbers are not guaranteed to be accessible from all phone providers within Australia.

==United Kingdom==

In the United Kingdom directory enquiries services (sometimes abbreviated as &quot;DQ&quot;) are provided by a variety of different companies, with a variety of call charges, each company reached by dialing a six-digit number beginning with 118. These companies supply information from the Operator Services Information System (OSIS), which is run by Directory Solutions, a division of BT Wholesale. OSIS accepts updates from telecoms providers seven days a week, and supplies that information to the inquiry companies six days a week. , there were over 200 providers. 118 118 (The Number) was the second most-expensive number at £11.23 for a 90-second call, but accounted for 40% of DQ calls, mostly due to heavy advertising.
Until 23 August 2003 directory inquiries were available by dialing 192 for numbers in Britain, and 153 for foreign numbers, with the service supplied by the caller&#x27;s telephone company. Until the 1990s, the service was free to use; then charges were introduced from 2 April 1991, although for some years directory inquiries continued to be free from payphones. Support for 192 and 153 was replaced on 24 August 2003 by competitive directory inquiries services using different numbers beginning &quot;118&quot;.

Calls to DQ services declined by an average of 38% yearly from 2014 to 2017.

===Pricing===

The pricing structure for UK directory inquiries was reformed by Ofcom on 1 July 2015. Call charges are made up of a per-minute access charge set by the caller&#x27;s telephony provider, plus a per-call and/or per-minute service charge set by the provider of the directory inquiries (or other) service, which is billed by the phone provider and passed on to the service provider.

The access charge for calls to 118 numbers varies from 2p to 27p per minute from landlines, or from 4p to 89p per minute from mobiles. It also applies for calls to 084, 087, and 09 numbers, and must be shown prominently in tariff lists.

The service charge may be charged per call, per minute, or a combination of the two. Originally, the per-call part could range from 5p to £16, and applies as soon as the call is answered, and the per-minute part could range from 1p to £8, and may apply either from the start of the call or after the first full minute. There were 100 available service charge price points, known as SC001 to SC100. The service charge must be declared alongside the number wherever it is advertised or promoted.

The applicable service charge codes are also shown in BT&#x27;s pricing table, section 2, part 15. Having found the &quot;SC&quot; code for a particular number, it is then necessary to refer to part 19 to find the cost.

Following criticism of very high and increasing charges for DQ services, Ofcom introduced a price cap to 2013 levels from 1 April 2019. Service charges, including VAT, may not exceed £3.65 per 90 seconds. The highest level service charge price points were withdrawn from use, with some of those &quot;SC&quot; codes re-defined to have a new, lower charge. Some other expensive price points remain, available for use only with 09 numbers but not 118 numbers.

===Controversies===
A number offering a directory inquiries service allowing people to request to be put through to a mobile phone number was established in June 2009. 118 800 proved to be controversial, however, when it was revealed that it was making available 15 million mobile numbers that it had bought from market researchers. Its website was suspended within weeks of its launch so that the company could re-engineer the site to enable the large number of ex-directory requests to be handled more efficiently. The related site was discontinued.

In 2014, the 118500 service run by BT was fined £225,000 by PhonepayPlus (later renamed as the Phone-paid Services Authority) for over-charging customers and failing to clearly display call costs. BT was also ordered to refund affected customers.

Later in 2014, a similar failure to clearly state call costs resulted in a fine for the 118118 service.

In 2017, soaring call costs for directory inquiries services, including 118118 and 118500 prompted an Ofcom review of 118 services. A price cap at 2013 rates took effect on 1 April 2019.

Some directory inquiries services stand accused of inappropriate methods of promoting their services, effectively scamming people into calling. Various unallocated geographic and non-geographic numbers play an announcement directing callers to call a particular directory inquiries number for help. People may hear this message when they misdial a wanted number or may appear to have missed a call from the unallocated number and hear this message if they call back.

===Charities===
Some services donate part of their income to charities, .

== Finland ==
Teleoperators in Finland are legally obligated to ensure their users&#x27; names, addresses, and telephone numbers are collected and published in a telephone directory, and to, for their part, ensure their users have access to a directory inquiry service. Furthermore, teleoperators are obligated to provide this contact information to another company for the purposes of providing a directory inquiry service. In practice, teleoperators hand telephone subscriptions&#x27; contact information to Suomen Numeropalvelu Oy, which forms and relays a number database to various directory assistance private companies.

<text>Lika () is a traditional region of Croatia proper, roughly bound by the Velebit mountain from the southwest and the Plješevica mountain from the northeast. On the north-west end Lika is bounded by Ogulin-Plaški basin, and on the south-east by the Malovan pass. Today most of the territory of Lika (Brinje, Donji Lapac, Gospić, Lovinac, Otočac, Perušić, Plitvička Jezera, Udbina and Vrhovine) is part of Lika-Senj County. Josipdol, Plaški and Saborsko are part of Karlovac County and Gračac is part of Zadar County, and it takes up about 12% of Croatia&#x27;s land area.

Major towns include Gospić, Otočac, and Gračac, most of which are located in the karst poljes of the rivers of Lika, Gacka and others. The Plitvice Lakes National Park and Northern Velebit National Park are also in Lika.

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===
Since the first millennium BC the region was inhabited by the Iapodes, an ancient people related to Illyrians. During the Gallic invasion of the Balkans, a division of the Gallic army passed through the territory of today&#x27;s Lika and a part of this army settled among the Iapodes.

In the 2nd century BC, Iapodes came into conflict with the Roman Empire, suffering several military campaigns, most significantly in 129 BC, 119 BC and finally being conquered in 34 BC by Augustus Caesar.

=== Medieval ===

Bijelohrvati (or &quot;White Croats&quot;) originally migrated from White Croatia to Lika in the first half of the 7th century. After the settlement of Croats (according to migrations theories), Lika became part of the Principality of Littoral Croatia. 

Lika then became a part of the Kingdom of Croatia in 925, when Duke Tomislav of the Croats received the crown and became King of Croatia.
The name of Lika is derived from old Illyrian language, meaning &quot;body of water&quot;; its cognates are &quot;liquor&quot; (&quot;fluid&quot;) in Latin and &quot;liqén&quot; (&quot;lake&quot;) in modern Albanian. Indeed, a major feature of the Lika landscape are rivers and lakes, as well as marshes and floodplains, many of which have been drained in 18th to 20th centuries. The name initially referred to Lika River, and over time came to denote the region. The first mention of Lika as a toponym appears in 10th-century Constantine Porphyrogenitus&#x27; book &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; as , in a chapter dedicated to Croats and the organisation of their state, describing how their ban &quot;has under his rule Krbava, Lika and Gacka&quot;.

Among the twelve noble Croat tribes that had a right to choose the Croat king, the Gusić tribe was from Lika. The ethnonym Guduscani mentioned in medieval sources was also thought to be related to Lika.

===From the 15th century===
In 1493 the Croatian army suffered a heavy defeat from the Ottoman forces in the Battle of Krbava Field, near Udbina in Lika. As the Ottomans advanced into Croatia, the Croatian population from the region gradually started to move into safer parts of the country or abroad. Many indigenous Chakavians of Lika leaving this area and to their places mainly arriving Neo-Shtokavian Ikavians from western Hezegovina and western Bosnia, and Orthodox (Vlachs and Serbs Neo-Shtokavian Ijekavians) from south-east of Balkan Peninsula. In 1513 the town of Modruš, the location of the episcopal see in Lika, was overrun by the Ottomans. In 1527 they captured Udbina, including the Udbina Castle, leaving most of Lika under Ottoman control. The region became initially part Sanjak of Bosnia, later the Sanjak of Klis and finally the Sanjak of Krka. The devastation of Lika and Krbava was such that almost half a century they remained largely uninhabited. At the end of the 16th century the Ottomans started settling Vlachs in the area, as well as Muslims in larger settlements where they soon formed a majority of the population.

Prince Radic was appointed Prince of Senj by King Rudolf in Graz (1 December 1600). Radic family is a Native noble family from Lika region; members of the family were Uskok military leaders at the headquarters in Senj. Prince of Senj was very active against Ottoman. In 1683 after Ottoman defeat at the battle of Vienna, 30,000 Muslims from Lika began to move towards Bosnia. Large number of these Muslims originated from Bosnia from which they came a century earlier, while a substantial proportion was of Croatian origin.

The Ottoman rule in Lika mostly ended in 1689 with the recapture of Udbina. However area of Donji Lapac remained in Ottoman hands for 102 years. The borders between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire were initially concluded with the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699, finally concluded with Treaty of Sistova in 1791. Lika was incorporated into the Karlovac general command of the Croatian Military Frontier. It was repopulated by immigrants from Ottoman held regions. Catholics predominated in urban settlements, while Orthodox Christians were mostly present in the interior of Lika.

On 15 July 1881 the Military Frontier was abolished, and Lika was restored to Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, an autonomous part of Transleithania (the Hungarian part of the Dual Monarchy of Austro-Hungary). It was within the Lika-Krbava County, with Gospić as the county seat. Its population was ethnically mixed and in 1910 consisted of 50.8% Serbs and 49% Croats.

=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia to SFRY ===

After the collapse of Austria-Hungary, Croatia and Slavonia, of which Lika was part, became part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs on October 29, 1918. The newly created state then joined the Kingdom of Serbia on December 1, 1918 to form &quot;Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes&quot; which was in 1929 renamed into Yugoslavia. Lika remained inside Croatia, which became one of the constituent provinces of the Kingdom. The majority of Lika belonged to the &quot;Županija Lika-Krbava&quot; with the capital in Senj (instead of in Gospić previously). The new constitution abolished any previous borders and Lika became a part of the &quot;Primorsko-krajiška Oblast&quot; with the capital in Karlovac. In 1929, the region became a part of the &quot;Sava Banate&quot; (&quot;Savska banovina&quot;) of the newly formed Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and then in 1939 of the &quot;Croatian Banate&quot; (&quot;Hrvatska banovina&quot;).

Yugoslavia was invaded and split by the Axis forces in 1941 and Lika became a part of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), an Axis puppet state led by the Ustaše. On 27 July the Srb uprising started against the Ustaše in Lika, led by Yugoslav Partisans. In June 1943 the founding session of the State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH) was held in Otočac in Lika, in the territory held by the Partisans. The war ended in 1945 and Croatia became a Socialist federal unit of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

===Croatian War of Independence===
In August 1990 an insurrection known as Log Revolution started in Serb populated areas of Croatia. Due to recent civil unrest and with Croatia declaring independence from Yugoslavia in June 1991, the Serb majority settlements of eastern Lika joined with fellow Serbian populace in Croatia in the creation and declaration of independence of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (&quot;RSK&quot;). Subsequently, the Serbian paramilitary units were created with the backing of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army and Serbian paramilitary forces. Clashes with the Croatian police that followed later in 1991 quickly erupted in a full-scale war. The fiercest fighting in Lika took place during the Battle of Gospić in August and September 1991 that resulted in the seat of the province being heavily damaged by the Serbian forces. Western Lika remained under Croatian control, while eastern Lika was under RSK control. War continued until 1995, when the Croatian Army took over the region in Operation Storm, ending the existence of the RSK.

After the war, a number of towns and municipalities in the region were designated Areas of Special State Concern.

== Economy ==
Lika is traditionally a rural area with a developed farming (growing potatoes) and livestock. Industry is minimal and relies mostly on wood processing. Tourism is important to the region, with two national parks (Plitvice Lakes National Park and Northern Velebit National Park) attracting visitors from all over the world. In 2015, Plitvice Lakes National Park attracted 1.2 million visitors.

== Culture ==

Lika has a distinct culture. The Ikavian and Shtokavian dialects of Croatian are both spoken in most of Lika, and Chakavian is spoken in the North around the town of Brinje.

Lika caps are worn by the local men and farmers informally at home, and also formally at weddings and celebrations.

=== Cuisine ===
The cuisine of Lika is shaped by its mountainous terrain, scarcity of arable land, cold winters, and the extensive practice of animal husbandry. It is simple, traditional and hearty, heavily focused on fresh, local ingredients and home style cooking. Maize, potatoes, lamb and dairy products form the basis of the local diet. Meat is commonly salted or dried, while on special occasions a whole lamb is roasted on a large skewer. Common meat products include &quot;šunka&quot; (ham), &quot;pršut&quot; (prosciutto), &quot;kulin&quot; (blood sausage) and &quot;žmare&quot; (čvarci). Dairy products such as butter, skorup and cheeses are abundant. &quot;Basa&quot; is a common cheese variety made from fermented milk and skorup. Trout is farmed and used extensively in many varieties, smoked, marinated or breaded in corn flour and fried. Trout caviar is local delicacy. The use of vegetables is limited, and mostly consists of cabbage, turnips and beans.

Common dishes include:

* Polenta - Eaten in many varieties, with skorup, žmare or sour cabbage.
* Stewed beans - Usually enriched with sour cabbage, turnip or bacon.
* &quot;Lički lonac&quot; (Lika pot) - A hearty, complex stew of mutton and various vegetables (potatoes, fresh cabbage, carrots, celery, parsley, bell peppers, tomatoes, etc.). Commonly eaten with boiled potatoes or polenta on the side.
* Lamb under a peka - Lamb and potatoes cooked in a large metal or ceramic lid.
* Sour cabbage with cured meat - Usually includes cured mutton, bacon, kulin, and potatoes on the side.

Common desserts include &quot;štrudla&quot; (&quot;savijača&quot;), ruffled dough stuffed with cheese or grated apples, and &quot;uštipci&quot;, deep fried nuggets of sweetened leavened dough.

== Population ==
The 2011 census data for Lika-Senj County shows 50,927 inhabitants, which is a decrease from the 53,677 inhabitants counted in 2001 (this is a drop of about 5.1% over the ten years and continues a decades-long depopulation trend in Lika). In 2011, 84.15% of the residents were of Croat, and 13.65% of Serb ethnicity.

<text>An Agricultural Testament is Sir Albert Howard&#x27;s best-known publication, and remains one of the seminal works in the history of organic farming agricultural movement. Dedicated to his first wife and co-worker Gabrielle, herself a plant physiologist, it focuses on the nature and management of soil fertility, and notably explores composting. At a time when modern, chemical-based industrialized agriculture was just beginning to radically alter food production, it advocated natural processes rather than man-made inputs as the superior approach to farming. It was first published in England in 1940, with the first American edition in 1943.

<text>The first HMS &quot;Montrose&quot; was one of eight Admiralty-type destroyer leaders, sometimes known as the &quot;Scott&quot; class. They were named after figures from Scottish history; &quot;Montrose&quot; was named for the Graham Dukes of Montrose. She was built during the First World War, but was completed too late for service then. However, she had a long career in the inter-war years and saw extensive service during the Second World War.

==Construction==
&quot;Montrose&quot; was ordered under the Wartime Emergency Construction Programme in April 1917, from Hawthorn Leslie of Hebburn. She was laid down at Hawthorn Leslie&#x27;s Hebburn-on-Tyne shipyard on 4 October 1917, launched on 10 June 1918, commissioned on 29 August 1918 and completed on 14 September that year.

==Design==
HMS &quot;Montrose&quot; was one of five Admiralty type flotilla leaders ordered from Cammell Laird in April 1917. The Admiralty type, or &quot;Scott-class&quot;, were designed to meet a requirement from Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, for a large, fast and heavily armed leader to match and outclass rumoured large German destroyers.
The ship was long between perpendiculars and overall, with a beam of and a draught of . Design displacement was normal and full load. The ship&#x27;s machinery consisted of four Yarrow boilers that fed steam at to two sets of Brown-Curtis single-reduction geared-steam turbines, rated at . This gave a design speed of light, which corresponded to about at full load. Up to 504 tons of oil fuel could be carried, giving a range of at .

The class had a main gun armament consisted of five 4.7 in (120 mm)/45 calibre BL Mark I guns, on CP VI mountings capable of elevating to 30 degrees, arranged in two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure with the remaining gun positioned on a platform between the funnels. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of a single  gun on a platform abaft the rear funnel together with a pair of single two-pounder (40mm) pom-pom autocannon for close-in protection on single mounts. Torpedo armament consisted of two triple mounts for 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes between the 3-inch AA gun and the rear pair of 4.7-inch guns.

===Modifications===
While &quot;Montrose&quot; had only limited modifications between the wars, an early change during the Second World War was the replacement of the amidships 4.7-inch gun by two 2-pounder (40 mm) &quot;pom-pom&quot; autocannon, with the aft funnel shortened to improve the field of fire for the 3-inch anti-aircraft gun. In 1941 or 1942, the 3-inch anti aircraft gun was moved aft to X-position, with two 20 mm Oerlikon autocannon were mounted on the ship&#x27;s bridge wings. Both sets of torpedo tubes were retained, while the ship was fitted to launch a 10-depth charge pattern. Type 271 radar was mounted above the ship&#x27;s bridge, replacing the low-angle director and associated rangefinder, while Type 291 radar was mounted at the top of the ship&#x27;s mast. In 1943, a twin 6-pounder (57 mm) replaced the 4.7-inch gun at A-position, for use against German E-boats.

==Service history==
After completion, &quot;Montrose&quot; joined the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, the destroyer component of the Harwich Force, as one of four leaders for this large flotilla, replacing sister ship , which had been sunk on 15 August that year. On 1 October 1918, in response to reports of German naval forces evacuating their bases in German-occupied Flanders, &quot;Montrose&quot;, along with five destroyers, were ordered to patrol off the Schouwen Bank, while the cruisers , waited off the Texel, in order to intercept any German heading for Germany. Significant German forces (including 28 destroyers) managed to successfully escape to German waters without being spotted, using Dutch territorial waters to avoid the blockading British.

===Mediterranean Fleet===
&quot;Montrose&quot; remained with the 10th Flotilla until February 1919, when she joined the Mediterranean Fleet, as part of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla. The ship continued to operate as part of the Mediterranean Fleet for ten years. &quot;Montrose&quot; operated in the Black Sea during 1919–1920, during the Russian Civil War, taking part in the evacuation of soldiers and refugees from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk in April 1919. In May–June 1919, she took part in operations off Feodosia and Arabat Spit, supporting White Army forces in the Kerch Peninsula, and shelling Red Army troops. In December 1919, &quot;Montrose&quot;″s commanding officer, Captain Malcolm Lennon Goldsmith, was awarded a bar to the Distinguished Service Order for his service in command of &quot;Montrose&quot; in the Black Sea. In March 1920, &quot;Montrose&quot; assisted in the evacuation of the remnants of the White Army at Novorossiysk. Many other Royal Navy warships assisted in the evacuation, along with British forces on land. On 29 March, &quot;Montrose&quot; took off refugees from Yalta.

&quot;Montrose&quot; recommissioned at Malta with a fresh crew on 16 June 1920. In September 1922, &quot;Montrose&quot; was stationed at Çanakkale on the Dardanelles during the Chanak Crisis, when Turkey confronted British and French forces occupying the Dardanelles and Constantinople. In May 1923, &quot;Montrose&quot; was part of a force, led by the battleship , with the cruiser and five more destroyers, that were ordered from Malta to the Dardanelles as hostilities between Greece and Turkey were feared to be about to restart, with the peace treaty negotiations at Lausanne threatening to break down. In October 1923, she joined the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, based at Malta, as leader. In February 1925, &quot;Montrose&quot; transferred to the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, again serving as leader until transferring to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in January 1927. On 20 June 1927, &quot;Montrose&quot; led the destroyers of the 1st Flotilla as they escorted as the battlecruiser left Malta carrying the Duke and Duchess of York on their tour of the Commonwealth.

===Home waters===
She finally returned to Britain in April 1929, and was refitted at Devonport from May to November that year, having her boilers retubed, before going into reserve at Sheerness. On 4 December 1930, &quot;Montrose&quot; was recommissioned into the 6th Destroyer Flotilla, now part of Atlantic Fleet, serving as leader until June 1931, when she returned to reserve at Portsmouth. In November 1931, she recommissioned as leader of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, before reducing to reserve at Devonport in June 1932. &quot;Montrose&quot; recommissioned on 10 July 1935, for local service in the English Channel, unattached to any destroyer flotilla, and in September 1935 joined the newly established 20th Destroyer Flotilla, formed with destroyers raised from reserve in order to replace destroyers sent to the Mediterranean during the Abyssinia Crisis. She was refitted at Devonport from 22 November 1935 and 13 January 1936, returning to active service on its completion. Duties including escorting dignitaries to and from the funeral of King George V in January 1936. The ship returned to reserve at Devonport on 1 May 1936.

===Second World War===
On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, &quot;Montrose&quot; was made leader of the 17th Destroyer Flotilla, based at Milford Haven and part of the Western Approaches Command, and for the first few months back in active service was tasked with anti-submarine patrols and convoy escort in the East Atlantic. On 30 September 1939, &quot;Montrose&quot; attacked a suspected German submarine south of Plymouth, and on 2 October 1939, &quot;Montrose&quot; and the destroyer attacked another suspected submarine.

On 26 May 1940, Operation Dynamo, the Evacuation of Dunkirk, began, with &quot;Montrose&quot; being ordered to take part. On 28 May she successfully evacuated 925 troops, landing them at Dover. She was heading out on another run to Dunkirk early in the morning of 29 May when she collided in a fog bank with the tug &quot;Sun V&quot;, breaking the destroyer&#x27;s stem. &quot;Montrose&quot; had to be towed back to Dover stern-first by the tug &quot;Lady Brassey&quot;. &quot;Montrose&quot; was under repair at Harland and Wolff&#x27;s North Woolwich yard from 31 May to 5 July 1940. After repair, &quot;Montrose&quot; joined the 18th Destroyer Flotilla, Nore Command, based at Harwich. In July 1940, in the first part of the Battle of Britain, German aircraft carried out a campaign of attacks against coastal shipping in the English Channel, and on 27 July, as part of this campaign, attacked &quot;Montrose&quot; and the destroyer , which were escorting minesweepers off Aldeburgh, Suffolk. &quot;Montrose&quot; claimed two German bombers shot down during the engagement, but was badly damaged by near-misses which immobilised her, while &quot;Wren&quot; was sunk. &quot;Montrose&quot; had to be towed back to Sheerness.
&quot;Montrose&quot; was under repair at Chatham Dockyard until October 1941, being reallocated to the 16th Destroyer Flotilla. She worked up at Scapa Flow until November 1941, In December 1941, the ship was detached from her flotilla to form part of the covering force for Operations Anklet and Archery, raids on Lofoten and Vågsøy in northern Norway. On 30 December, &quot;Montrose&quot; hit a rock off Herston, Orkney, damaging her port propeller shaft. She was under repair at Rosyth until the end of May 1942.

On 1 August 1942, &quot;Montrose&quot; was detached to the Home Fleet to replace destroyers sent to the Mediterranean for the important Malta Convoy, Operation Pedestal. &quot;Montrose&quot; formed part of the distant covering force for the Arctic convoys PQ 18 and QP 14 in September 1942, while in December 1942 – January 1943 was part of the distant escort of convoys RA 51 and JW 52. On 1 February 1943, she left Scapa for the Nore Command, resuming coastal patrols and convoy escort duties off the east coast of Britain. On the night of 17/18 February 1943, &quot;Montrose&quot; and the Hunt-class destroyer were on patrol when they encountered several German E-boats that were laying a minefield off Lowestoft. In the resulting engagement, one of the German torpedo boats, &quot;S71&quot;, was immobilised and then rammed and sunk by &quot;Garth&quot;. On 24 October 1943, &quot;Montrose&quot; collided with the Hunt-class destroyer , badly damaging &quot;Cotswold&quot;, which was under repair for over 6 months.

In June 1944, &quot;Montrose&quot; took part in supporting the Normandy Landings. She left Harwich on 5 June, and was escorting follow-on convoys to the Eastern (British) operating area from 6 June. She was awarded the ship&#x27;s last battle honour during these operations. On 7 July, &quot;Montrose&quot;″s stern was damaged when the ship was in collision with the cargo ship &quot;Empire Heywood&quot; off Harwich. &quot;Montrose&quot; suffered more serious damage on 19 July when she collided with the landing ship &quot;LST-430&quot; and was docked at the Port of Immingham for repairs. &quot;Montrose&quot; did not re-enter service, and was instead placed into Category C Reserve on 2 November 1944. &quot;Montrose&quot; was allocated by BISCO to Hughes Bolckow Ltd for disposal on 31 January 1946 and scrapped at Blyth in Northumberland.

<text>New York State Route 440 (NY 440) is a freeway located entirely on Staten Island in New York City. The route acts as a connector between the two segments of Route 440, running from the Staten Island neighborhood of Charleston in the south to Port Richmond in the north. NY 440 is connected to the two New Jersey segments by the Outerbridge Crossing to the south and the Bayonne Bridge to the north. It is one of several signed New York State routes that are not connected to any others in the state, and one of only two New York State routes (NY 426 being the other) that is the middle section of another state&#x27;s highway bearing the same number. From the Korean War Veterans Parkway to I-278, it is known as the West Shore Expressway. North of I-278, it is named the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway (also known as the Willowbrook Expressway). NY 440 is the southernmost state route in the state of New York.

==Route description==

NY 440 begins at the New York–New Jersey state line, mid-span on the east-west Outerbridge Crossing over the Arthur Kill in the Charleston neighborhood of Staten Island. The four-lane bridge crosses east through Charleston and over Arthur Kill Road.

After entering Staten Island, NY 440 passes through a toll barrier for eastbound traffic entering the city. Immediately following the toll barrier is a ramp to Page Avenue, the eastbound exit 1. In the westbound direction, the ramp to Arthur Kill Road is exit 1.

After Page Avenue, NY 440 enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Korean War Veterans Parkway (though often referred to as the Richmond Parkway, its name until 1997) and a nearby park and ride. At exit 2 in Charleston, NY 440 exits the right-of-way it entered on, which becomes the Korean War Veterans Parkway, while NY 440 proceeds north as the co-signed West Shore Expressway.

The West Shore Expressway continues north as a four-lane expressway, entering exit 3, a ramp to Woodrow Road going northbound. Crossing into the Rossville neighborhood, the expressway enters exit 3 southbound, connecting to Bloomingdale Road, and parallels a section of the Arthur Kill. Crossing north of South Shore Golf Course, the West Shore enters exit 4, an interchange with Huguenot Avenue. Continuing northeast, NY 440 is routed parallel with the eastern side of the former Fresh Kills Landfill, with exit 5 providing access to Arden Avenue. Bending northward once again, the West Shore crosses over Fresh Kills creek, and passes through a portion of the William T. Davis Wildlife Refuge. West Shore continues through the Chelsea-Travis neighborhood, accessible at exit 7 through a service road interchange with Victory Boulevard (itself previously designated as NY 439A, until ).
Running along the northern end of Travis, the West Shore Expressway parallels nearby railroad tracks before entering exit 8, a ramp to South Avenue and the Bloomfield neighborhood. Just a bit further north, the expressway enters exit 9 northbound, a single ramp to Glen Street. Just north of Glen Street, the West Shore Expressway enters a semi-directional T interchange with the northwest-southeast Staten Island Expressway portion of I-278. At this interchange, NY 440 and I-278 become concurrent for a short distance on the Staten Island Expressway, a four-lane expressway along the northern tier of Staten Island. Along this stretch, NY 440 and I-278 meet Richmond Avenue at exit 7. Just to the east, the expressway enters exit 9, which serves as a junction with the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway (the Dr. MLK Jr., also known, for its initial portion, as the Willowbrook Expressway).

NY 440 turns north off I-278 and continues as the Dr. MLK Jr. Expressway, just north of an interchange with Victory Boulevard. The Dr. MLK Jr. Expressway crosses north through Staten Island, with the neighborhoods of Graniteville then Mariners Harbor on the west side, while Westerleigh then Elm Park (technically a portion of the Port Richmond neighborhood) are on the east side. Dr. MLK Jr. enters exit 12, a junction with Forest Avenue (the portion used by the previously designated, until 1968, NY 439), forming a &quot;four corners&quot; of the neighborhoods just mentioned. Continuing north, Dr. MLK Jr. enters exit 13, which connects to Walker Street in Port Richmond. Just north of exit 13, NY 440 passes through an electronic toll collection gantry (for traffic crossing from New Jersey over the Bergen Point Reach to enter onto the northside of Staten Island), then slopes onto the abutments of the Bayonne Bridge, condensing to four lanes. A short distance to the north, NY 440 crosses the state line back into New Jersey, continuing north as Route 440 into the city of Bayonne.

&lt;/mapframe&gt;

NY 440 was initially designated in 1949, beginning at the Outerbridge Crossing and ending at the Bayonne Bridge, as it does today; however, the route was originally routed on Drumgoole Boulevard and Richmond Avenue in between the two bridges. In the early 1950s, proposals surfaced for the Willowbrook Parkway, which would extend from Staten Island Marine Park (later Great Kills Park and now part of the Gateway National Recreation Area) on the island&#x27;s East Shore to the Bayonne Bridge via Egbertville and Bulls Head. A second highway, the West Shore Expressway, was proposed . As proposed, it would begin at the Outerbridge Crossing and run along the west shore of Staten Island to meet the Clove Lakes Expressway (I-278) near the Goethals Bridge.
The first section of the Willowbrook Parkway—from I-278 north to modern exit 13—was completed by 1965. A short extension south to Victory Boulevard was opened to traffic by 1968. The highway was also renamed the Willowbrook Expressway by this time. It was never extended past Victory Boulevard as opposition from both local property owners and environmental activists prevented construction of the rest of the highway. Its original route has never been formally demapped, however. NY 440 was realigned to follow the Willowbrook Expressway by 1970.

Drumgoole Boulevard was transformed into a freeway in the late 1960s and early 1970s and renamed the Richmond Parkway (now the Korean War Veterans Parkway) ; however, NY 440 initially continued to follow the parkway. The segment of the West Shore Expressway southwest of Huguenot Avenue was opened and became part of a realigned NY 440 on July 1, 1977. NY 440 left the expressway at Huguenot Avenue and followed Arthur Kill Road east to Richmond Avenue, where it continued north on its original alignment. The former alignment of NY 440 on the Richmond Parkway was redesignated as Temporary NY 440. When the West Shore Expressway was completed in 1976, the Temporary NY 440 designation was eliminated while NY 440 was shifted westward to follow the West Shore and Clove Lakes Expressways between Huguenot Avenue and the Willowbrook Expressway.

In the mid-1960s, officials in New Jersey and New York considered extending the I-287 designation eastward from its current terminus at the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) to Staten Island via New Jersey Route 440 and the Richmond Parkway. The idea was eventually halted soon afterward. However, it is possible that the New York State Department of Transportation may reconsider these plans in the future. In 1990, the Willowbrook Expressway was renamed the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway in honor of Martin Luther King Jr., the famous civil rights leader. However, it is sometimes still called the Willowbrook Expressway by many locals today. The West Shore Expressway was ceremonially designated the Pearl Harbor Veterans Expressway by New York Governor George Pataki in 1999. However, the expressway&#x27;s official name did not change.

<text>A daughter is a female offspring; a girl or a woman in relation to her parents. Daughterhood is the state of being someone&#x27;s daughter. The male counterpart is a son. Analogously the name is used in several areas to show relations between groups or elements. From biological perspective, a daughter is a first degree relative. The word daughter also has several other connotations attached to it, one of these being used in reference to a female descendant or consanguinity. It can also be used as a term of endearment coming from an elder.

In patriarchal societies, daughters often have different or lesser familial rights than sons. A family may prefer to have sons rather than daughters and subject daughters to female infanticide. In some societies, it is the custom for a daughter to be &#x27;sold&#x27; to her husband, who must pay a bride price. The reverse of this custom, where the parents pay the husband a sum of money to compensate for the financial burden of the woman and is known as a dowry. The payment of a dowry can be found in societies where women do not labour outside the home.


==Perception==
In the United States, the birth rate is 105 sons to 100 daughters which has been the natural birth rate since the 18th century. In the US, prospective parents seeking to adopt a child display a slight preference for girls over boys. In fertility clinics that enable sex preferences, daughters are usually preferred over sons. In the traditions of various Abrahamic religions, Luluwa is regarded as the first daughter to have ever existed.

== Daughters in literature ==
The role of the daughter has been an important theme in literature, especially when exploring relationships between family members and gender roles. Through exploration of the relationship between children and their parents, readers can draw conclusions about the impact of parenting style on the growth and development of a child&#x27;s character and personality.

Notable daughters whose character and development has been impacted by their parents in literature have been:

<doc id="449914" wikidata="Q1060288" url="?curid=449914" title="Lake Minnetonka">
<text>Lake Minnetonka (Dakota: &quot;Mní iá Tháŋka&quot;) is a lake located about west-southwest of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Lake Minnetonka has about 23 named bays and areas. The lake lies within Hennepin and Carver counties and is surrounded by 13 incorporated municipalities. At , it is Minnesota&#x27;s ninth largest lake.

Lake Minnetonka was formed around 10,000 years ago during the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The lake consists of interconnected kettle lakes, channels, and marshlands, along with 18 islands, giving it an irregular shape and of shoreline. Human habitation in the area dates back approximately 10,000 years, beginning with ancestral Indigenous peoples. Between 3500 BCE and 1500 CE, the Mound Builders era flourished; in the 1880s, 524 burial mounds and earthworks along the lakeshore were mapped and estimated to date from 300 BCE to 100 CE. By the 1700s, the Dakota people inhabited the area, utilizing the lake for hunting, fishing, harvesting wild rice, and setting up maple sugar camps. The lake holds cultural and spiritual significance for the Dakota people, with sacred sites such as Spirit Knob playing an important role in their traditions and beliefs. Following the Dakota War of 1862, the Dakota people were forcibly removed from the region.

European American settlement began in the 1850s, and with the advent of streetcars, trains, and steamboats, Lake Minnetonka became a nationally recognized vacation destination. Attractions like Big Island Park (1906) and the Excelsior Amusement Park (1925) contributed to its popularity. However, as resort areas developed in other parts of the country, Lake Minnetonka&#x27;s national prominence as a vacation hotspot declined. It is a popular spot for local boaters, sailors, and fishermen.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The first people who inhabited the Lake Minnetonka area were Indigenous peoples who migrated to the region at the end of the last ice age circa 8000 BCE. Later peoples who inhabited the area between 3500 BCE and 1500 CE are commonly referred to collectively as the &quot;Mound Builders&quot; because they constructed large land features serving spiritual, ceremonial, burial, and elite residential functions. The Mound Builder culture reached its apex circa 1150 CE and ceased to exist circa 1500 CE. In the 1880s, 524 burial mounds were mapped around the lakeshore, estimated to have been made between 300 B.C. and 100 A.D.


By the 1700s, Lake Minnetonka was inhabited by the Mdewakanton people, a subtribe of the Dakota Nation. The Dakota traditionally moved their villages seasonally: wild rice harvesting in the autumn, hunting camps in the winter, and maple sugar camps in the spring. The Mdewakanton, based in the Minnesota and Mississippi River valleys, used Lake Minnetonka as part of this annual cycle to hunt, fish, and gather resources like wild rice and maple sap. Big Island served as a key maple sugar camp, while Spirit Knob, a peninsula near present-day Wayzata, holds spiritual significance for the Dakota as an offering site. An important fur-trade Dakota trail extended from Spirit Knob around the lake to the village of Chief Shakopee I near present-day Shakopee, Minnesota, following a route that corresponds to present-day Minnesota State Highway 101, also known as Bushaway Road. During the Treaty of Mendota negotiations, the brother of Chief Shakopee II asserted that Lake Minnetonka should be included within their Dakota reservation boundaries. However, following the Dakota War of 1862, the Dakota were forcibly removed from the region (the conflicts of the war did not reach Lake Minnetonka).

Despite interactions with European Americans at Fort Snelling, the Dakota kept the lake secret from them due to its cultural significance. The first white Americans known to have visited Lake Minnetonka were two teenage boys, Joe Brown and Will Snelling, who canoed up Minnehaha Creek from Fort Saint Anthony in 1822. However, few other Euro-Americans visited the lake or even knew of its existence for three subsequent decades.

Lake Minnetonka was officially named by Minnesota&#x27;s territorial governor, Alexander Ramsey, in 1852. He had been informed that the Dakota used the phrase &quot;Mní iá Tháŋka&quot; (“the-water-they-speak-of-is-large” in the Dakota language) to refer to the lake. Excelsior, the lake&#x27;s first white settlement, was established the following year. The first steamboat on Lake Minnetonka, a small side-wheel steamer named &quot;Governor Ramsey&quot;, was launched in 1861. Travel to Lake Minnetonka remained relatively difficult, however, until the Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad extended a line to Wayzata in 1867.

Peter Gideon, an early Minnesota horticulturist, moved to the Lake Minnetonka area in 1853. In 1868 he successfully bred a species of apple that could withstand Minnesota&#x27;s harsh winters and named it the &quot;Wealthy&quot; in honor of his wife. This breakthrough made possible the later developments of the Haralson and Honeycrisp apples in 1913 and 1974, respectively.

=== Resort years ===

The construction of hotels and boarding houses near Lake Minnetonka boomed during the 1870s and early 1880s. The first large hotel on the lake, the Hotel Saint Louis in Deephaven, was built in 1879 and boasted 150 guest rooms with private verandas. The larger Lake Park Hotel was completed in Tonka Bay later that year. The largest hotel ever built on Lake Minnetonka, the Hotel Lafayette in Minnetonka Beach, opened in 1882. At nearly long and five stories tall, the Hotel Lafayette could accommodate over 1,000 guests. Many guests hailed from the Deep South and spent entire summers on the lake to enjoy its scenery and cooler climate.

Large steamboats also proliferated on Lake Minnetonka during this time. The first inland steamboat ever to be equipped with electric lights, &quot;City of Saint Louis&quot;, was assembled in Wayzata in 1881 and began servicing lakeside communities and resorts later that year. The largest vessel ever to operate on Lake Minnetonka, &quot;Belle of Minnetonka&quot;, was launched and put into service in 1882. At long, &quot;Belle of Minnetonka&quot; could purportedly accommodate up to 2,500 passengers.

The lake&#x27;s first yacht club, the Minnetonka Yacht Club, was founded in 1882 in Deephaven. Hazen Burton, one of the club&#x27;s original co-founders, is credited for commissioning the development of the racing scow. When he debuted the first racing scow, &quot;Onawa&quot;, in 1893, it was disqualified for winning nearly every regatta it entered. The rules were eventually modified, however, and racing scows became popular within the sailing community worldwide. &quot;Onawa&quot; is currently displayed at the Excelsior-Lake Minnetonka Historical Society Museum in Excelsior.

Many of Lake Minnetonka&#x27;s visitors began finding new places to vacation as the railroads expanded westward in the 1890s, causing most of the lake&#x27;s hotels and steamboats to suffer financially and cease operations. Some hotels burned during this time, but most were demolished or dismantled. By 1900, however, an increasing number of families had begun to construct private summer cottages around Lake Minnetonka. Permanent homes and grand country estates also began to appear around the lake as the Twin Cities metropolitan area grew. Some of these homes and cottages still exist, including the Thompson Summer House in Minnetonka Beach.

=== Golden years ===
In 1905 the Twin City Rapid Transit Company (TCRT) extended a streetcar line to the village of Excelsior on Lake Minnetonka&#x27;s southern shore. The lake saw dramatic change in 1906 as TCRT also opened Big Island Park on Big Island and debuted its Express Boat service. The Express Boats, casually referred to as “streetcar boats,” were essentially floating streetcars that served the lake&#x27;s summer residents. Six (and later seven) of these steamboats connected 26 landings around the lake to Excelsior, where passengers could transfer onto streetcars bound for the Twin Cities. Many streetcar boat passengers were lakeside residents commuting to their jobs in Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Tourists, on the other hand, could board one of three large ferry boats bound for Big Island Park, where they could picnic, enjoy live music, and ride several attractions. However, TCRT closed Big Island Park in 1911 due to its excessive operating and maintenance costs.

Ridership on the streetcar boats began to plummet when roads were improved in the area in the early 1920s. Steamboat service on Lake Minnetonka grew evermore limited during this time, and by 1926 TCRT had suspended all steamboat service on the lake. To rid itself of the vessels, TCRT scuttled three of the seven streetcar boats in deep water north of Big Island that summer. Three of the other boats were scrapped shortly thereafter, and one was sold and used as an excursion boat until it, too, was scuttled in 1949. Streetcar service to Excelsior continued until 1932.

Crane Island, an island near the western shore of the lake, was organized as a summer cottage retreat in 1907. The Crane Island Association platted a number of lots around the perimeter of the island and dedicated a commons area at its center. Many of the island&#x27;s original cottages remain, and today it is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Several of the area&#x27;s most prestigious country clubs, including the Lafayette Club, Minnetonka Country Club, and Woodhill Country Club, were also founded during this period.

=== Late 20th century ===
Fred W. Pearce, a well-known amusement park operator, opened Excelsior Amusement Park in Excelsior in 1925. Attractions included a fun house, the &quot;Silver Streak&quot;, the &quot;Scrambler&quot;, a carousel, picnic accommodations, and a roller coaster called the &quot;Cyclone&quot;. The Rolling Stones performed live at the park&#x27;s Danceland pavilion in 1964 for a crowd of approximately 300. Excelsior Amusement Park continued to be a tourist destination until it closed in 1973. Today the site is occupied by a condominium complex and Maynards Restaurant.

In 1926 architect Frank Lloyd Wright and his mistress Olga Hinzengberg were arrested for allegedly violating the Mann Act while vacationing at a cottage in Tonka Bay. The charges were soon dropped after allegations against them were found untrue.

Before gaining national fame in the early 1940s, LaVerne, Maxene, and Patty Andrews of The Andrews Sisters spent their summers with relatives in Mound, a town in an area known as Westonka. The trio often returned to the area later in life as well.

In 1946 Mound Metalcraft was established in Mound. The company changed its name to Tonka Toys in the 1950s, when it became known for manufacturing toy trucks. Tonka Toys was purchased by Hasbro in 1991 and is no longer based in Minnesota.

Two F4 tornadoes ravaged the Lake Minnetonka area during the tornado outbreak of 1965, causing much damage in the communities of Mound, Navarre, and Deephaven. Hundreds of homes and many local businesses were destroyed during the outbreak.

The steamboat &quot;Minnehaha&quot;, one of the streetcar boats scuttled in 1926, was raised from the bottom of Lake Minnetonka in 1980, restored, and returned to service by 1996. Now operated by the Museum of Lake Minnetonka, &quot;Minnehaha&quot; once again carries passengers between the communities of Excelsior and Wayzata as she did over a century ago.

=== National Historic Districts and Places ===
The Lake Minnetonka area is home to two National Historic Districts: the Crane Island Historic District and The Water Street Historic District in the community of Excelsior. It is also home to 6 National Register of Historic Places sites.

== Natural history and limnology ==
=== Geography ===
Lake Minnetonka was formed approximately 10,000 years ago as the Laurentide Ice Sheet receded northward. The lake is a collection of kettle lakes connected by channels and marshlands which, along with 18 islands, form its irregular shape and of shoreline. Lake Minnetonka is divided into two halves, the Upper Lake in the west and the Lower Lake in the east, which reflect the easterly flow of water in the lake&#x27;s watershed. The deepest point of Lake Minnetonka is in Crystal Bay. The average depth of the lake is approximately . With a surface area of , Lake Minnetonka is the ninth largest lake in Minnesota.

=== Hydrology ===
Several streams flow into Lake Minnetonka, the largest of which is Six Mile Creek. The only outlet from the lake is Minnehaha Creek. At the headwaters of Minnehaha Creek near the lake&#x27;s eastern end, the Grays Bay Dam helps maintain an average water level of above sea level. The flow over the dam ranges from zero to per second, or a daily rate of up to . Evaporation from Lake Minnetonka can reach as high as per day. Annual evaporation from the lake is about , or . This is countered by an average rainfall rate of per year and an average surface runoff rate of per year. There have been a number of droughts throughout Lake Minnetonka&#x27;s history, notably during the 1930s and late 1980s. Water levels reached a record low of above sea level in 1937 and a record high of above sea level in 2014.

Lake Minnetonka typically freezes over with of ice during the winter months. The median &quot;ice-out&quot; date, which has been recorded on Lake Minnetonka since 1855, is April 14. The earliest recorded ice-out date was March 11, 1878, and the latest recorded ice-out date was May 8, 1856. Water surface temperatures typically peak at around 80°F (26.7°C) in early August.

=== Freshwater biology ===
Lake Minnetonka contains black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, bowfin, common carp, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, muskellunge, northern pike, pumpkinseed, rock bass, smallmouth bass, walleye, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. Some fish consumption guidelines have been placed on the lake&#x27;s bluegill, common carp, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.

According to local legend, a sturgeon in excess of in length has lurked beneath the surface of Lake Minnetonka for many years. Sightings of the sturgeon, which is often referred to as &quot;Lou,&quot; have been persistent since the 1980s. In 2019 a large sturgeon was caught by two boys on Minnehaha Creek. The Minnesota DNR speculated that it could have originated from Lake Minnetonka.

=== Environmental issues ===
Lake Minnetonka&#x27;s environmental issues became a concern after curly-leaf pondweed was discovered in its waters in 1900. Purple loosestrife was discovered in the lake in 1940, as was Eurasian water milfoil in 1987. Zebra mussels were discovered in the lake in 2010.

Lake Minnetonka suffered from significant sewage, fertilizer, and surface runoff pollution until the 1970s. Conditions have since improved, but pollution from fertilizer and surface runoff remains an ongoing issue. Water quality is now closely monitored.

It is not uncommon for some Lake Minnetonka beaches to be temporarily closed due to elevated levels of E. coli contamination. An outbreak of an unidentified waterborne pathogen sickened at least 116 swimmers at Cruiser&#x27;s Cove, a popular party spot near Big Island, in 2019.

Lake Minnetonka&#x27;s environment is currently overseen by three separate agencies. These include the Minnehaha Creek Watershed District, the Lake Minnetonka Conservation District, and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.

== Attractions and activities==
 Some of the most visited attractions on Lake Minnetonka are restaurants. Al &amp; Alma&#x27;s Supper Club and Charter Cruises was founded in Mound in 1956 and is Lake Minnetonka&#x27;s oldest continually-operated restaurant and cruise line. Lord Fletcher&#x27;s restaurant in Spring Park has been one of Lake Minnetonka&#x27;s most popular establishments since opening in 1968. Maynards Restaurant, established in Excelsior in 1998, is another popular waterfront restaurant. Downtown Excelsior and Wayzata have since become Twin Cities culinary destinations as many new restaurants continue to appear there.

The Old Log Theater, located in Greenwood, first opened in 1940 and is now Minnesota&#x27;s oldest professional theater organization. Alumni of the theater include actors Nick Nolte and Loni Anderson.

Lake Minnetonka is home to several regional parks owned by Three Rivers Park District. The largest among these are Lake Minnetonka Regional Park in Minnetrista and Noerenberg Gardens in Orono. Three Rivers Park District also maintains two regional bike trails near the lake. Two other large public parks on Lake Minnetonka include Big Island Nature Park and the Excelsior Commons.

Boating, sailing, and fishing are the most common activities on Lake Minnetonka. Boats of all sizes and horsepower may be legally launched on Lake Minnetonka, but speed and noise restrictions do apply. The lake has four active yacht clubs and an antique and classic boat society known as the Bob Speltz Land O&#x27; Lakes Chapter of the ACBS. Several cruise companies operate larger excursion vessels on the lake, the largest of which is Al &amp; Alma&#x27;s &quot;Bella Vista&quot;. Lake Minnetonka&#x27;s magnificent homes are a common highlight on these sightseeing, dinner, and brunch cruises.

Other activities on Lake Minnetonka include swimming, kayaking, and standup paddleboarding during the summer, and ice fishing, snowmobiling, and ice yachting during the winter.

Several community festivals are held around the lake each year. Some of the larger events include James J. Hill Days in Wayzata, Apple Day in Excelsior, and the Spirit of the Lakes Festival in Mound.

== In popular culture ==
Perhaps the best known association is that with local music icon Prince. His third album, &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;, was recorded at a home on Lake Minnetonka&#x27;s North Arm in 1980. Prince rented and lived at the home between 1979 and early 1981. He ultimately settled in Chanhassen, approximately two miles south of Lake Minnetonka, in 1987. Lake Minnetonka is famously mentioned in the 1984 film &quot;Purple Rain&quot; during a scene in which The Kid (Prince) tells his love interest (Apollonia Kotero) to &quot;purify [herself] in the waters of Lake Minnetonka.&quot; After she enters the water, Prince reveals that the water she has entered is not actually Lake Minnetonka. Dave Chappelle mocked the scene in a 2004 episode of &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; when he asked (as Prince), &quot;Why don&#x27;t you purify yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka?&quot; while winning a basketball game.

Several scenes from the 1972 films &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; and &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; were filmed at Lake Minnetonka. In an episode of the television series &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot;, Dylan (Luke Perry) tells Brenda (Shannen Doherty) that his privileged background enabled him to spend summers in Paris as a child. Brenda reacts by saying &quot;You mean &quot;you&quot; went to Paris every summer? &quot;We&quot; went to Lake Minnetonka!&quot; Lake Minnetonka was briefly featured in the reality television series &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot; in 2011. Several scenes from the 2017 film &quot;Wilson&quot; were filmed at Lake Minnetonka. Shots of Lake Minnetonka were included in the lyric video for the 2015 song &quot;Cool for the Summer&quot; by Demi Lovato.

Thurlow Lieurance&#x27;s song &quot;By the Waters of Minnetonka&quot; was published by the Theodore Presser Company in 1913 and has since been recorded by artists such as Glenn Miller and Desi Arnaz. Singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt&#x27;s self-titled debut album was recorded at an abandoned summer camp on Lake Minnetonka&#x27;s Enchanted Island in 1971.

Lake Minnetonka received some unwanted national attention in October 2005 following an incident known as the Minnesota Vikings boat party scandal. In insurance, lake side properties of Lake Minnetonka&#x27;s shore side is considered to be the front door, rather than the road side, called the Waterfront (area).

<doc id="449917" wikidata="Q332654" url="?curid=449917" title="Henry Phipps, 1st Earl of Mulgrave">
<text>General Henry Phipps, 1st Earl of Mulgrave, (14 February 17557 April 1831), styled The Honourable Henry Phipps until 1792 and known as The Lord Mulgrave from 1792 to 1812, was a British Army officer and politician who served as Foreign Secretary from 1805 to 1806.

==Background and education==
Lord Mulgrave was a younger son of Constantine Phipps, 1st Baron Mulgrave of New Ross), by his wife the Hon. Lepell, daughter of John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey, and was educated at Eton and the Middle Temple.

==Military career==
Lord Mulgrave entered the army in 1775, and eventually rose to the rank of General. He saw service in the Caribbean during the American Revolutionary War. In 1793 he was made Colonel of the 31st (Huntingdonshire) Regiment of Foot. Also in 1793, because he was on a mission to the King of Sardinia in Turin, he was near at hand when British forces captured the French port of Toulon, and he briefly took command of the British land forces there, before withdrawing upon the arrival of more senior officers. In 1799 he was sent out on another special military mission, this time to the headquarters of the Austrian commander, Archduke Charles, to attempt to persuade him to retain his troops in Switzerland rather than removing them to the Middle Rhine, but he was unsuccessful.

==Political career==
In 1784 Lord Mulgrave was elected to the House of Commons for Totnes. He supported the government of Pitt, to whom he eventually became close. In 1790, he was elected for Scarborough in Yorkshire. He succeeded his brother Constantine Phipps, 2nd Baron Mulgrave as Baron Mulgrave in the Peerage of Ireland in 1792, but did not succeed to his brother&#x27;s British title. In 1794 he was granted a British peerage as Baron Mulgrave, entering the House of Lords, and in 1796 he was made Governor of Scarborough Castle. Mulgrave supported Pitt when he resigned in 1801, and in return for his loyalty was rewarded with the office of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (1804–1805) in Pitt&#x27;s second government. Following an accident suffered by Lord Harrowby, Mulgrave took his place as Foreign Secretary, in which position he helped Pitt to form the Third Coalition against Napoleon.

The post of Foreign Secretary was generally thought to be beyond his powers. Thomas Grenville, writing to the Marquis of Buckingham, expressed an opinion that he was only &quot;put in ad interim until Lord Wellesley&#x27;s arrival, who is expected in June&quot;. Mulgrave, however, showed himself fairly capable in debate. On 11 February 1805 he had to announce the breach with Spain, and to defend the seizure of the treasure ships at Ferrol before the declaration of war, and on 20 June to defend the coalition of 1805. He composed an ode on the victory of Trafalgar, and it was set to music by Thomas Arne. On 23 January 1806 Pitt died. On 28 January 1806 Mulgrave laid before the House of Lords copies of the treaties recently concluded with Russia and Sweden, to which Prussia and Austria had acceded, and on 4 February he explained their object. Three days later, on 7 February, he resigned, with the bulk of those who had been Pitt&#x27;s friends.

With the death of Pitt and the formation of the Ministry of All the Talents in 1806, Mulgrave, along with the other Pittites, went into opposition, but when the Pittites returned to power in 1807, Mulgrave served in various major offices, first as First Lord of the Admiralty (1807–1810), then as Master-General of the Ordnance (1810–1819), and finally as Minister without Portfolio (1819–1820). As First Lord he was heavily involved in planning both the successful expedition against Copenhagen in 1807, and the disastrous one to Walcheren in 1809. After moving to the ordnance board, Mulgrave became less active politically. In 1812, he was created Viscount Normanby and Earl of Mulgrave in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==Family==
The Earl of Mulgrave&#x27;s grandfather William Phipps had married Lady Catherine Annesley, who was the daughter and heiress of James Annesley, 3rd Earl of Anglesey, and his wife, Lady Catherine Darnley (an illegitimate daughter of King James II by his mistress Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester). Lady Catherine Darnley had later married John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby, and hence Henry Phipps, 1st Earl of Mulgrave, was the step-great-grandson of the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby.

Lord Mulgrave married Martha Sophia, daughter of pottery manufacturer Christopher Thomson Maling, at St Michael&#x27;s, Houghton-le-Spring in 1795. He died in April 1831, aged 76, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Constantine, who was later created Marquess of Normanby. His second son was the Hon. Sir Charles Beaumont Phipps and his third, Edmund Phipps, a lawyer and author. The couple&#x27;s fourth son, the Hon. Augustus Frederick (b. 1809) became honorary canon of Ely. Of their five daughters, only one survived childhood.

The Countess of Mulgrave died on 17 October 1849.

<text>Shalva Nutsubidze (; December 14, 1888 – January 6, 1969) was a Georgian philosopher, cultural historian, rustvelologist, literary critic, translator, public figure, one of the founders of scientific school in the field of history of Georgian philosophy, one of the founders and prorector (1920–1929) of the Tbilisi State University, Director of the Fundamental Library of the TSU, Dean of the Department of History of World Literature, Doctor of Philosophy, Professor, elected member of the Academy of Sciences of the Georgian SSR (1944), Meritorious Scientific Worker of Georgia (1961).

Nutsubidze attended universities in Saint Petersburg, Berlin, and Leipzig. In 1917, he obtained assistant professorship of the Saint Petersburg State University. He received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 1927.

From 1904 to 1911, Nutsubidze was a member of the Bolskevik wing of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and the Georgian Socialist-Federalist Revolutionary Party from 1915. From 1919 to 1921, he was a member of the Constituent Assembly of Georgia. After the Soviet annexation of the Democratic Republic of Georgia, he did not leave the country.

He founded his original philosophical doctrine, &quot;Alethiologian Realism&quot;, while working in Germany. Nutsubidze studied the history of Georgian philosophy in the 1930s, laying the groundwork for a new field of Kartvelian studies, the history of Georgian philosophy. He developed the theory of the Eastern Renaissance and the Nutsubidze-Honigmann theory, which established the identity of Peter the Iberian and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite.

Nutsubidze was fluent in Greek, Latin, German, Russian, and French. His translation of &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot; into Russian language is considered one of the best translations of this poem.

== Ancestry ==
Nutsubidze&#x27;s grandfathers were both priests. Philipe Datiashvili, his grandfather (from mother&#x27;s side), loved to read and taught his grandson Nuskhuri alphabet to read at a young age. Nutsubidze&#x27;s father, Isak Nutsubidze, was a teacher. He studied with Vazha-Pshavela at Gori&#x27;s Mastery Seminary before becoming a teacher in Khoni and Kutaisi. Isak Nutsubidze was a skilled hunter who frequently went hunting with his son. He died in 1927. Nutsubidze&#x27;s mother, Rebeka Datiashvili, was from Kvitiri.

Nutsubidze&#x27;s elder sisters were Aneta, Tamar, Elene, and Nino. Tamar, one of them, attended St. Petersburg Technological University and then the Faculty of Geography and Geology at Tbilisi State University. He worked as a researcher and academic secretary at the Institute of Geography of the Georgian National Academy of Sciences. Nino, the second sister, graduated from the Russian Department of the Faculty of Philology of Tbilisi State University and worked as a Russian language teacher, first at a school and then at the Tbilisi Medical Institute.

== Early years and education ==

Nutsubidze was born on December 14, 1888, in Partskhanakanevi (near Kutaisi). He attended Khoni Primary School and Khoni&#x27;s Mastery Seminary for his primary education. Here he met with Akaki Tsereteli, Vazha-Pshavela, Niko Nikoladze, Ivane Gomarteli, Barbara Kipiani, and Ilia Khoneli first time. In 1897, he continued his studies at the Kutaisi Classical Gymnasium. He was elected editor of the illegal magazine &quot;Gantiadi&quot; in sixth grade, which he led until he graduated from high school.

From 1904 to 1905, he was an active participant in the gymnasium&#x27;s political life. In 1904, he joined the Bolshevik fraction of the Social-Democratic Workers&#x27; Party. He worked as a regional propagandist and attended the funeral of the revolutionary Alexander Tsulukidze in 1905, where he also spoke on behalf of the Samtredia organization. From 1905 to 1906, he attended illegal Vano Sturua meetings. He was part of a group led by Vano Sturua that traveled from St. Petersburg to Finland in 1906 to meet with Vladimir Lenin.

In 1905, Isak Nutsubidze was appointed headmaster of the school in the village of Kulashi, and the family relocated there. Nutsubidze graduated from the Classical Gymnasium and enrolled in the Department of Philosophy of the Faculty of History and Philology at St. Petersburg University in 1906. While studying in St. Petersburg, he once again collaborated with Georgian revolutionary students such as Vano Sturua, Mamia Orakhelashvili, Shalva Eliava, Silibistro Todria, and others.

Nutsubidze delivered a lecture about &quot;Philosophical and Historical Materialism&quot; at the public session of St. Petersburg&#x27;s University in 1907. During his stay at university, he studied under Alexander Vvedensky, N. Karaev, N. Losky, and others. Nutsubidze frequently visited Georgia and read public reports about political issues. The report &quot;Marxism and Personality&quot;, which was read at the Kutaisi Theater, drew a large audience, and the police almost detained members of the Imereti-Samegrelo Committee of the Social Democratic Party, who were listening to the report from behind the scenes.

Nutsubidze graduated from St. Petersburg University in 1910 and began his career as a history, psychology, and Latin language teacher in the Kuban Oblast. Later, with the assistance of Professor Alexander Vvedensky, he returned to St. Petersburg University, passed the master&#x27;s oral and written examinations, and began lecturing in 1917 to achieve the Privatdozent degree. Nutsubidze received a Privatdozent degree the same year.

He was twice dispatched on scientific visits to Europe from St. Petersburg University. From 1911 to 1914, every May–August, he attended summer seminars in Germany. He founded his original philosophical doctrine, &quot;Alethiologian Realism&quot;, while working in Germany. He spent much of his time at Leipzig, where he was mentored by notable philosophers such as Wilhelm Wundt, Johannes Folkelt, and Karl Barth. Nutsubidze was a teacher at St. Petersburg&#x27;s Second Gymnasium in 1914. Grigol Tsereteli, who eventually became his closest friend, met him here. Nutsubidze was a lecturer at St. Petersburg University from 1916 to 1918.

== Tbilisi State University ==

Nutsubidze was a key figure in the formation of Tbilisi State University. During his stay in St. Petersburg in 1917, Giorgi Akhvlediani handed him Ivane Javakhishvili&#x27;s invitation. Nutsubidze left his wife and children in St. Petersburg and returned to Tbilisi to participate in the university&#x27;s establishment preparations. He was in charge of bringing Georgian professors to the university.

Nutsubidze held a variety of posts at the university, including Vice-Rector (1920–1929), Dean, Director of the Fundamental Library, Head of the department, First Dean of the Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, and others. He also founded and oversaw a law school. For 15 years, he was the Dean of the Department of History of World Literature, which eventually became the Faculty of Western European Languages and Literature. Nutsubidze taught a variety of courses at different faculties, including logic, introduction to philosophy, historical materialism, history of social and political thoughts, scientific methodology, history of Western European literature, and others.

Nutsubidze was also tasked with writing textbooks for students studying philosophy at Tbilisi State University. In a short period of time, he prepared textbooks on which subsequent generations (Mose Gogiberidze, Konstantine Megrelidze, Savle Tsereteli, Konstantine Bakradze, Angia Bochorishvili) were raised: &quot;Logic. Elementary Textbook&quot; in 1919, &quot;Logic for Secondary School&quot; and &quot;Introduction to Philosophy, Part I, The Problem of Cognition&quot; in 1920 and &quot;Logic: A Propaedeutic Course&quot; in 1923.

Nutsubidze and his companions (Sergi Gorgadze, among others) established the Petritsi Intellectual Society at Tbilisi State University in 1918, organizing seminars and discussions to gather Georgian philosophical monuments and spread philosophical knowledge. He also introduced &quot;General Education Courses&quot;, in which students of all ages who did not have a high school degree were admitted and allowed to continue their education at the university after graduation. The classes were incorporated into government school in 1927.

== 1920–1940 ==

Nutsubidze and Giorgi Chubinashvili attended an exhibition of Georgian art relics in Germany in 1920. In 1921, he started working for Tedo Glonti&#x27;s Socialist-Federalist newspaper, which was published with the consent of the Revolutionary Committee. The &quot;Social Philosophy Studying Group&quot; was founded the same year under his direction.

On the recommendation of the university&#x27;s pedagogical department, Nutsubidze left for Europe in 1925, to become acquainted with the work of philosophical seminars at Berlin University. Nutsubidze was a professor at Leipzig University from 1925 until 1926. He intended to translate &quot;The Basics of Aletheology&quot; into German while on a scientific trip, but changed his mind and authored a new book, &quot;Wahrheit und Erkenntnisstruktur&quot; (&quot;Truth and the Structure of Cognition&quot;), which was reviewed in 1926 by prominent Neo-Kantians Arthur Liberty and Buchenau.

Nutsubidze received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy on April 17, 1927, after successfully defending his doctoral dissertation, &quot;Truth and the Structure of Cognition&quot;. He went on a scientific trip to Germany in 1928. In 1930, he traveled to Germany to see an exhibition of Georgian art relics. Nutsubidze was not permitted to continue his philosophy lectures at Tbilisi State University after his return to Georgia.

He was a senior researcher at the Tbilisi Teaching Institute in 1935.

== 1940–1950 ==
Nutsubidze was a professor at the Maxim Gorky Institute of World Literature in Moscow from 1940 to 1941. He returned to Georgia in 1942 and resumed his lecturing at Tbilisi State University. Nutsubidze was elected a full member of the Georgian SSR Academy of Sciences in 1944.

Nutsubidze was dispatched to Berlin on a special assignment in 1945. According to one story, he was in charge of investigating the fate of Yakov Dzhugashvili, though his presence and work in Berlin were exploited to hold Georgian exiles by Soviet security services.

He began working at the Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Georgia in 1946. At the same time, he taught a course at Tbilisi State University about the history of Georgian philosophy. During a discussion at the Institute of Philosophy in 1948, Petre Sharia and Ilarion Talakhadze fiercely criticized the work &quot;Rustaveli and the Eastern Renaissance&quot;, and Nutsubidze was dismissed a year later.

== Politics ==

Nutsubidze was a prominent political figure. He was actively involved in the school&#x27;s political life while still in high school. From 1904 until 1911, he was a member of the Bolshevik wing of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, which he left in 1911 to join the Georgian Social-Federalist Revolutionary Party. In 1917, he was elected to the Central Council of All-Russian National Socialist Parties and as a representative of it was dispatched to St. Petersburg, where the Declaration of All-Russian Nationalities was declared. He was elected to the National Council of Georgia in November of the same year.

Nutsubidze was elected to the main committee of the Georgian Socialist-Federalist Revolutionary Party in 1918. From 1919 to 1921, he was a member of the Constituent Assembly of Georgia from the same party. He signed the Declaration of Independence of Georgia. He served in the Educational and Librarian Commissions.

The Constituent Assembly met on February 1, 1921. During the break, Nutsubidze and Benia Chkhikvishvili had a dispute in which Benia punched Nutsubidze in the eye and took his hand towards the handgun, while Nutsubidze threw a chair at him. A few days after the confrontation, the Socialist-Federalists proposed to the Constituent Assembly&#x27;s Presidium that Chkhikvishvili&#x27;s Membership of Parliament status be revoked, but the Assembly voted and removed the topic from the agenda. In response to public dissatisfaction demonstrations were held.

Nutsubidze did not emigrate with the government after Georgia was annexed by Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on February 25, 1921. Two days later Nutsubidze led the formation of a temporary main committee of the Federalist Party. The Federalists supported the Soviet government as a result of the committee&#x27;s decision.

Between 1923 and 1929, Nutsubidze served in the Central Executive Committees of the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic and the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. He was a president of Georgian branch of the Union for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries in 1934.

== Repressions ==

Nutsubidze was detained in Tashiskari on August 31, 1938, on suspicion of spying for Germany. He was handed to the People&#x27;s Committee of the USSR for State Security on December 1, the same year, after being accompanied from Tbilisi to Moscow. He was charged with counter-revolutionary actions, propaganda, and direct actions against the working class and the revolutionary movement in support of the counter-revolutionary government.

While in prison, Nutsubidze was ordered to translate &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot; into Russian language by Ioseb Jughashvili, but he had already begun translating of the poem in 1937 and had been reading sections in the audience. In compensation for a translation, he was also released from jail. Nutsubidze finished the fourth complete translation of &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot; into Russian on May 1, 1939, which was sent to Stalin.

Nutsubidze and Sergey Kavtaradze personally met Stalin on October 20, 1940. Ioseb Jughashvili revised the poem, provided the translator one Strophe of his translation, and the work was published the following year, with the edition by S. Gorodetsky, which included a preface by Sergo Kavtaradze and illustrations by Mihály Zichy, Sergo Kobuladze, and Irakli Toidze. The translation was published in mass circulation by &quot;Goslitizdat&quot;, although the translator did not get an honorarium. According to Nutsubidze&#x27;s declaration, the honorarium was completely credited to the Defense Fund.

Following Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 and the fall of Lavrenty Beria&#x27;s power Nutsubidze was expelled from the Academy of Sciences of the Georgian SSR on December 22, 1938, and three days later from Tbilisi State University. Nutsubidze&#x27;s works, &quot;History of Georgian Philosophy&quot; and &quot;Rustaveli and the Eastern Renaissance&quot;, were published before 1960, but he was limited to full-fledged scientific and educational activity. From 1956 to 1960, he worked as a senior researcher at the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences of the Georgian SSR, and in 1960, he received full rehabilitation from the prosecutions of the USSR, and his scientific status was restored.

== Scientific research ==
Nutsubidze&#x27;s scientific works are diversified. His works are sometimes separated into two periods: the metaphysical period and the history of Georgian philosophy. The first phase includes four works aiming to establishing a new system in philosophy: &quot;Bolzano and Theory of Science&quot; (1913), &quot;Fundamentals of Alethiology&quot; (1922), &quot;Truth and the Structure of Cognition&quot; (1926), and &quot;Philosophy and Wisdom&quot; (1931).

Nutsubidze&#x27;s publications address pedagogical themes (&quot;The Idea of Man and the Problem of Upbringing in The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot;, &quot;Education and Education Ideas in the Georgian Renaissance&quot;, etc.&quot;) the system of higher education and scientific degrees in ancient Georgia, dialectical and formal logic and Georgian culture. Nutsubidze&#x27;s work &quot;Theory of Art (Fundamentals of Monistic Aesthetics)&quot; (1929) was the first Georgian work in this field.

Nutsubidze authored school and university textbooks, philosophical terminology, and translated treasures of Georgian poetry into foreign languages, among other things. He established the groundwork for the development of Georgian philosophical terminology with Dimitri Uznadze.

=== Alethiology ===

Nutsubidze set the groundwork for the original philosophical system, Alethiology, while working in Germany in 1911–1914. In Leipzig in 1911, he read a report on the principles of Alethiology. In 1913, he published &quot;Bolzano and Theory of Science&quot; in Russian, and in 1922, he published &quot;Fundamentals of Alethhiology, Part I. The Problem of Cognition&quot; in Tbilisi. In Germany, the book &quot;Truth and the Structure of Cognition: The First Introduction to Alethiologian Realism&quot; was released in German.

Nutsubidze&#x27;s second book, &quot;Philosophie und Weisheit&quot; (&quot;Philosophy and Wisdom&quot;) was published in German in 1931. &quot;The First Introduction to Alethiologian Realism&quot;, first published in 1927, was &quot;a specific introduction to Alethiologian Realism&quot;. Nutsubidze defined Alethiology as the field that exists between essence and thought. He remarked that his Alethiologian reduction differed from Ziggvart&#x27;s reduction approach in that it was rationally comprehended, as well as from Husserl&#x27;s phenomenological reductions.

Nutsubidze&#x27;s articles published in German drew a lot of attention in Western philosophical journals. Many reviews of his works have been appeared in Germany, England, Switzerland, and France. Bruno Bauch, a German Neo-Kantian philosopher, earned favorable reviews as well, and both volumes were highly appreciated by Kurt Gassen. In 1932, Bartholomeus Landheer published a review in the International Journal of Ethics in which he stated that Nutsubidze had made a substantial contribution to the simple solution of tough difficulties of the modern philosophy. Konstantine Bakradze, a Georgian philosopher, responded to one of the works, and his letter, &quot;The Problem of Truth and the Structure of Cognition&quot;, was published in the magazine &quot;Mnatobi&quot; in 1928.

=== History of Georgian Philosophy ===

Nutsubidze was denied the right to continue teaching philosophy at Tbilisi State University after his return from Germany in 1930. He began studying the history of Georgian philosophy in the 1930s, laying the groundwork for a new branch of Kartvelian studies, the history of Georgian philosophy. His publications on the eastern roots of the Renaissance, as well as the identities of the Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and Peter the Iberian, are particularly noteworthy. This hypothesis was proposed by Nutsubidze in 1942. A similar finding was reached ten years later by a Belgian scientist, E. Honigman.

Nutsubidze and the renowned philologist Simon Kaukhchishvili devised a comprehensive plan for publishing old Georgian philosophical artifacts. They released &quot;განმარტებაი პროკლესთვის დიადოხოსისა და პლატონურისა ფილოსოფიისათვის&quot; in 1937, which comprised high-level searchings as well as Georgian-Greek and Greek-Georgian dictionaries. This book not only offered a scientific study of an important representative of Georgian philosophical thought, but it also increased interest in Georgian philosophical thought.

Nutsubidze&#x27;s two-volume &quot;History of Georgian Philosophy&quot; was published in 1956–1958, and it covers the history of Georgian philosophy from the ancient mythological epic poetry to Solomon Dodashvili. Nutsubidze had already dedicated several works to the Georgian mythological epic. He researched and translated &quot;Amirani&#x27;s Epic&quot;.

Nutsubidze recognized three periods in history of Georgian philosophical thought: the Ancient Age (from the Kolkheti High Rhetorical and Philosophical School through 6th-7th centuries), the Feudal Age (8th-18th centuries), and the age of Capitalism (19th-20th centuries). Further, the Feudal era was divided into three periods: early feudalism (8th-11th centuries), feudal absolutism (11th-12th centuries), and late feudalism (13th-18th centuries).

Nutsubidze also researched Georgian cultural concerns. He devoted numerous letters to the inscriptions of Georgian monasteries discovered in Palestine and the construction of monasteries associated with the name of Peter the Iberian. He was particularly interested in the Georgian &quot;Balahvariani&quot;. Hermann Zottenberg published a research in 1886 in which he demonstrated that the work did not belong to John of Damascus. Nutsubidze released a study in Russian titled &quot;On the Origins of the Greek Book Barlaam and Joasaph&quot; 70 years later, in which he addressed the subject of the author of the Greek novel and attacked Franz Joseph Dölger&#x27;s opinion. According to Nutsubidze, the Greek novel is based on Georgian manuscript. He deduced that the author of &quot;Balavariani&quot; and &quot;Limonari&quot; is the same person, and the author of the first edition of the works is the same person, a famous figure of the 7th century, Ioane Moskhi.

=== Rustvelology ===

Very considerable is Nutsubidze&#x27;s contribution to Rustvelology. Rustaveli hels a special place in his research not only from the viewpoint of the poet&#x27;s philosophical outlook, but also as a great humanist of his time.

Russian translation of &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot; by Nutsubidze in 1937-1940 is widely regarded as one of the greatest. According to Alexey Tolstoy, Nutsubidze&#x27;s translation of &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot; is &quot;not only a scientific work, but also a poetic work&quot;, and with rhythm rotation the translator solved the problem of translating the dactyl lines into Russian language.

Nutsubidze&#x27;s translation was the first utilized in the translation of various languages: Victor Kerbach in Romanian language, Igor Sikiri in Polish language, Ipey Fukuro in Japanese language, and Sergi Tsuladze in French (which is considered one of the best French translations of the poem). Nutsubidze also backed Maria Pritvits&#x27; and Austrian poet Hugo Huppert&#x27;s German translations.

Nutsubidze&#x27;s monographic work &quot;The Work of Rustsveli&quot; provides a multifaceted, in-depth analysis of the poem. The author&#x27;s objective was to shed light on the great poet&#x27;s cultural context, which included a tangle of complicated issues ranging from socioeconomic and political situations to the popular, literary, and philosophical sources of &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot;. According to him, the poem&#x27;s origins should be traced primarily along three lines: Broadly speaking, Rustaveli&#x27;s poetry was prepared by Georgian folk Traditions and the history of Georgian philosophy, in connection with its literary forefathers.

== Later life ==

Nutsubidze was named Honored scientist of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1963. He continued to teach at Tbilisi State University in 1967. During this time, he focused primarily on the history of medieval European philosophy.

Nutsubidze was not allowed to participate in Rustaveli&#x27;s jubilee in 1966, nor was he allowed to attend meetings with foreign guests or speak. He was not permitted to give a speech at the 50th anniversary of Tbilisi State University in 1968.

Nutsubidze died in Tbilisi on January 6, 1969, aged 80. On January 9, he was laid to rest in the Tbilisi State University Pantheon. On the scientist&#x27;s grave is a statue created by Otar Parulava.

== Personal life ==
Nutsubidze was married twice. Agnessa Filipova, the first wife, was born in a Georgian Catholic family. She died from a tuberculosis in 1937. Ketevan, the couple&#x27;s daughter, was born in 1915. Nutsubidze was still alive when his first daughter died.

Nutsubidze married for the second time at the age of 56 to Ketevan Klimiashvili, a divorcee with two children, Zakro and Rusudan. Nutsubidze treated them as if they were his own children. The couple were the parents of three kids. At the age of five, the first son died from diphtheria.

Nutsubidze had an unusual approach to religion. He did not attend church. He remembered many prayers he had learned in the gymnasium by heart and knew divine law so well that even his friend, Catholicos-Patriarch Kalistrate Tsintsadze, was taken aback. Ephraim II of Georgia frequently discussed theological issues with him.

== Legacy ==
In 1969, Nutsubidze Street was named after him. Saburtalo plateau is also named after him in Tbilisi. Aside from the Tbilisi State University Pantheon, Nutsubidze&#x27;s monument can be found in the garden of Nutsubidze Street.

Phido Nadibaidze, Archil Begiashvili, Guram Tevzadze, and others have published works about Nutsubidze&#x27;s Aletheologian Realism. His &quot;The Theory of Art&quot; has received little attention.

Tamaz and Tamar Nutsubidze donated Nutsubidze&#x27;s private library to Tbilisi State University Library in 2013. It contains 635 library units with 594 names.

<text>A fairy ring, also known as fairy circle, elf circle, elf ring or pixie ring, is a naturally occurring ring or arc of mushrooms. They are found mainly in forested areas, but also appear in grasslands or rangelands. Fairy rings are detectable by sporocarps (fungal spore pods) in rings or arcs, as well as by a necrotic zone (dead grass), or a ring of dark green grass. Fungus mycelium is present in the ring or arc underneath. The rings may grow to over in diameter, and they become stable over time as the fungus grows and seeks food underground.
Fairy rings are the subject of much folklore and myth worldwide, particularly in Western Europe. They are alternately seen as hazardous or dangerous places linked with witches or the Devil, or as a sign of good fortune.

==Genesis==
The mycelium of a fungus growing in the ground absorbs nutrients by secretion of enzymes from the tips of the hyphae (thread-like branching filaments making up the mycelium). This breaks down larger molecules in the soil into smaller molecules that are absorbed through the hyphae walls near their growing tips. The mycelium moves outward from the center, and when the nutrients in the center are exhausted, the center dies, forming a living ring, from which the fairy ring arises.

There are two theories regarding the process involved in creating fairy rings. One states that the fairy ring is begun by a spore from the sporocarpus. The underground presence of the fungus can also cause withering or varying colour or growth of the grass above. The second theory, which is presented in the investigations of Japanese scientists on the &quot;Tricholoma matsutake&quot; species, shows that fairy rings could be established by connecting neighbouring oval genets of these mushrooms. If they make an arc or a ring, they continuously grow about the centre of this object.

==Necrotic or rapid growth zones==

One of the manifestations of fairy ring growth is a necrotic zone—an area in which grass or other plant life has withered or died. During a dry year, these zones are caused by the mycelia, which coat the roots of grasses and other herbs in meadows. After some time, they are removed by biotic factors from the ground; at this stage, a zone on the surface soil becomes visible. Patterns other than the basic ring or arc are also possible: circles, doubled arcs, sickle-shaped arcs, and other complicated formations are also formed by this process. Fungi can deplete the soil of readily available nutrients such as nitrogen, causing plants growing within the circle to be stressed, which leads to plant discoloration. Some fungi also produce chemicals that act like hormones called gibberellins, which affect plant growth, causing rapid luxuriant growth.

Long-term observations of fairy rings on Shillingstone Hill in Dorset, England, further suggested that the cycle depended on the continuous presence of rabbits. Chalky soils on higher elevations in the counties of Wiltshire and Dorset in southern England used to support many meadow-type fairy rings. Rabbits crop grass short in open areas and produce nitrogen-rich droppings. Mushrooms need more soil nitrogen than grass does. A ring can start from only a few spores from which the mycelium develops; the fruiting bodies of the mushrooms appearing only later when sufficient mycelial mass has been generated to support them. Subsequent generations of fungi grow only outward because the parent generations have depleted their local nitrogen levels. Meanwhile, rabbits keep cropping the grass, but do not eat the fungi, allowing them to grow through their competition to tower, relatively, above the grass. By the time a circle of mushrooms reaches about in diameter, rabbit droppings have replenished the nitrogen levels near the centre of the circle, and a secondary ring may start to grow inside the first.

Soil analysis of soil containing mycelium from a wood blewit (&quot;Clitocybe nuda&quot;) fairy ring under Norway spruce (&quot;Picea abies&quot;) and Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;) in southeast Sweden yielded fourteen halogenated low molecular weight organic compounds, three of which were brominated and the others chlorinated. It is unclear whether these were metabolites or pollutants. Brominated compounds are unknown as metabolites from terrestrial fungi.

== Types ==
There are two generally recognised types of fairy ring fungus. Those found in the woods are called &quot;tethered&quot; because they are formed by mycorrhizal fungi living in symbiosis with trees. Meadow fairy rings are called &quot;free&quot; because they are disconnected from other organisms. These mushrooms are saprotrophic. The effects on the grass depend on the type of fungus that is growing; when &quot;Calvatia cyathiformis&quot; is growing in the area, grass grows more abundantly; however, &quot;Leucopaxillus giganteus&quot; causes the grass to wither.

== Species involved ==

About 60 mushroom species can grow in the fairy ring pattern. The best known is the edible Scotch bonnet (&quot;Marasmius oreades&quot;), commonly known as the fairy ring champignon.

One of the largest rings ever found is near Belfort in northeastern France. Formed by &quot;Infundibulicybe geotropa&quot;, it is thought to be about in diameter and over 700 years old. On the South Downs in southern England, &quot;Calocybe gambosa&quot; has formed huge fairy rings that also appear to be several hundred years old.

=== Oral tradition and folklore ===
A great deal of folklore surrounds fairy rings. Their names in European languages often allude to supernatural origins; they are known as (&quot;witches&#x27; circles&quot;) in French, and (&quot;witches&#x27; rings&quot;) in German. In German tradition, fairy rings were thought to mark the site of witches&#x27; dancing on Walpurgis Night, and Dutch superstition claimed that the circles show where the Devil set his milk churn. In Tyrol, folklore attributed fairy rings to the fiery tails of flying dragons; once a dragon had created such a circle, nothing but toadstools could grow there for seven years. European superstitions routinely warned against entering a fairy ring. French tradition reported that fairy rings were guarded by giant bug-eyed toads that cursed those who violated the circles. In other parts of Europe, entering a fairy ring would result in losing an eye. Fairy rings are associated with diminutive spirits in the Philippines.

Western European traditions, including English, Scandinavian, and Celtic, claimed that fairy rings are the result of elves or fairies dancing. Such ideas dated to at least the mediæval period; The Middle English term &quot;&quot; (&quot;elf-ring&quot;), meaning &quot;a ring of daisies caused by elves&#x27; dancing&quot; dates to the 12th century. In his &quot;History of the Goths&quot; (1628), Swedish writer Olaus Magnus makes this connection, saying that fairy rings are burned into the ground by the dancing of elves. British folklorist Thomas Keightley noted that in Scandinavia in the early 19th century, beliefs persisted that fairy rings (&quot;elfdans&quot;) arose from the dancing of elves. Keightley warned that while entering an &quot;elfdans&quot; might allow the interloper to see the elves—although this was not guaranteed—it would also put the intruder in thrall to their illusions.

The folklores of Britain and Ireland contain a wealth of fairy lore, including the idea from which fairy rings take their name: the phenomena result from the dancing of fairies. In 19th-century Wales, where the rings are known as &quot;&quot;, fairies were almost invariably described as dancing in a group when encountered, and in Scotland and Wales in the late 20th century, stories about fairy rings were still common; some Welshmen even claimed to have joined a fairy dance. Victorian folklorists regarded fairies and witches as related, based in part on the idea that both were believed to dance in circles. These revels are particularly associated with moonlit nights, the rings becoming visible to mortals only the following morning. Local variants add other details. An early 20th-century Irish tradition says that fairies enjoy dancing around the hawthorn tree so that fairy rings often centre on one. One resident of Balquhidder, Scotland, said that the fairies sit on the mushrooms and use them as dinnertables, and a Welsh woman claimed that fairies used the mushrooms as parasols and umbrellas. Olaus Magnus in &quot;Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus&quot; wrote that the brightness of the fairy ring comes not from the dancing of the fairies, who harm it with their feet, but from Puck, who refreshes the grass. A Devon legend says that a black hen and chickens sometimes appear at dusk in a large fairy ring on the edge of Dartmoor. A Welsh and Manx variant current in the 1960s removes dancing from the picture and claims that fairy rings spring up over an underground fairy village. These associations have become linked to specific sites. For example, &quot;The Pixies&#x27; Church&quot; was a rock formation in Dartmoor surrounded by a fairy ring, and a stone circle tops Cader Idris in northern Wales, believed to be a popular spot for fairy dances.

Many folk beliefs generally paint fairy rings as dangerous places, best avoided. American writer Wirt Sikes traces these stories of people trespassing into forbidden territory and being punished for it to the tale of Psyche and Eros. In it, Psyche is forbidden to view her lover; when she does so, her palace disappears, and she is left alone. Superstition calls fairy circles sacred and warns against violating them lest the interloper (such as a farmer with a plough) anger the fairies and be cursed. In an Irish legend recorded by Wilde, a farmer builds a barn on a fairy ring despite the protests of his neighbours. He is struck senseless one night, and a local &quot;fairy doctor&quot; breaks the curse. The farmer says that he dreamed that he must destroy the barn. Even collecting dew from the grass or flowers of a fairy ring can bring bad luck. Destroying a fairy ring is unlucky and fruitless; superstition says it would simply grow back.

A traditional Scottish rhyme sums up the danger of such places:

Numerous legends focus on mortals entering a fairy ring—and the consequences. One superstition is that anyone who steps into an empty fairy ring will die at a young age. A 20th-century tradition from Somerset calls the fairy ring a &quot;galley-trap&quot; and says that a murderer or thief who walks in the ring will be hanged. Most often, someone who violates a fairy perimeter becomes invisible to mortals outside and may find it impossible to leave the circle. Often, the fairies force the mortal to dance to the point of exhaustion, death, or madness. In Welsh tales, fairies actively try to lure mortals into their circles to dance with them. A tale from the Cambrian Mountains of Wales, current in the 19th century, describes a mortal&#x27;s encounter with a fairy ring:

Entering the ring on May Eve or Halloween night was especially dangerous. One source near Afon fach Blaen y Cae, a tributary of the Dwyfach, tells of a shepherd accidentally disturbing a ring of rushes where fairies are preparing to dance; they capture him and hold him captive, and he even marries one of them. In variants from Scotland recorded by Edwin Sidney Hartland in 1891, the ring is replaced by a cavern or an old mill.

Freedom from a fairy ring often requires outside intervention. A tactic from early 20th-century Wales is to cast wild marjoram and thyme into the circle and befuddle the fairies; another asks the rescuer to touch the victim with iron. Other stories require that the enchanted victim simply be plucked out by someone on the outside, although even this can be difficult: A farmer in a tale from the Llangollen region has to tie a rope around himself and enlist four men to pull him from the circle as he goes in to save his daughter. Other folk methods rely on Christian faith to break the enchantment: a stick from a rowan tree (thought to be the wood from which the cross of Jesus Christ was built) can break the curse, as can a simple phrase such as &quot;what, in Heaven&#x27;s name&quot;, as in a 19th-century tale from Carmarthenshire. A common element to these recoveries is that the rescuer must wait a year and a day from when the victim entered the ring.

Mortals who have danced with the fairies are rarely safe after being saved from their enthrallment. They often find that what seemed to be but a brief foray into fairyland was much longer in the mortal realm, possibly weeks or years. The person rescued from the fairy ring may have no memory of their encounter with the sprites, as in a story from Anglesea recorded in 1891. In most tales, the saved interlopers face a grim fate. For example, in a legend from Carmarthenshire, recorded by Sikes, a man is rescued from a fairy ring only to crumble to dust. In a tale from Mathavarn, Llanwrin Parish, a fairy-ring survivor moulders away when he eats his first bite of food. Another vulnerability seems to be iron; in a tale from the Aberystwyth region, a touch from the metal causes a rescued woman to disappear.

Some legends assert that the only safe way to investigate a fairy ring is to run around it nine times. This affords the ability to hear the fairies dancing and frolicking underground. According to a 20th-century tradition of Northumberland, this must be done under a full moon, and the runner must travel in the direction of the sun; to go widdershins allows the fairies to place the runner under their sway. To circle the ring a tenth time is foolhardy and dangerous. Keightley recorded a similar tradition from Northumberland in 1828: &quot;The children constantly run this number [nine times], but nothing will induce them to venture a tenth run.&quot; A story from early 20th century England says that a mortal can see the sprites without fear if a friend places a foot on that of the person stepping beyond the circle&#x27;s perimeter. Another superstition says that wearing a hat backward can confuse the fairies and prevent them from pulling the wearer into their ring.

Although they strongly associate doom, some legends paint fairy circles as places of fertility and fortune. Welsh folk believe that mountain sheep that eat the grass of a fairy ring flourish, and crops sown from such a place prove more bountiful than those from normal land. A folk belief recorded in the &quot;Athenian Oracle&quot; claims that a house built on a fairy circle brings prosperity to its inhabitants. Likewise, a legend from Pont y Wern says that in the 13th or 14th century, the inhabitants of the town of Corwrion watched fairies dancing in a ring around a glow worm every Sunday after church at a place called Pen y Bonc. They even joined the sprites in their revels. The legend survives in a rhyme: &quot;With the fairies nimbly dancing round / The glow-worm on the Rising Ground.&quot; John Rhys recorded a Welsh tale in 1901 that tells of a man who supposedly lived on the side of the Berwyn, above Cwm Pennant, in the early 19th century. The man destroyed a nest of rooks in a tree surrounded by a fairy ring. In gratitude, the fairies gave him a half crown every day but stopped when he told his friend, &quot;for he had broken the rule of the fair folks by making their liberality known&quot;. Nevertheless, fairy boons are not without their curses, and tales often tell of the sprites exacting their revenge.

=== Literature ===
Fairy rings have been featured in the works of European authors, playwrights, and artists since the 13th century. In his Arthurian romance &quot;Meraugis de Portlesguez&quot;, Raoul de Houdenc describes a scene clearly derived from Celtic fairy-ring lore: The title character visits the Château des Caroles and sees a circle of women and a knight dancing around a pine in the castle courtyard. Meraugis is unable to fight the intense desire to join in, thus freeing the previous knight from the spell. Meraugis is helpless to leave the dance until, ten weeks later, another knight joins it and frees him. Fairy circles feature in works by several Elizabethan poets and playwrights. William Shakespeare alludes to them in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, Act II, Scene I (&quot;And I serve the fairy queen, / To dew her orbs upon the green&quot; and &quot;To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind&quot;), and &quot;The Tempest&quot;, Act V, Scene I:

Shakespeare&#x27;s contemporary Thomas Randolph speaks of fairy rings in his &quot;Amyntas, or the Impossible Dowry&quot; (1638), and Michael Drayton describes one in &quot;Nymphidia: The Court of Fairy&quot;:

Fairy imagery became especially popular in the Victorian era. Thomas Hardy uses a fairy ring as a symbol of lost love in &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; (1886); the character Michael Henchard passes a fairy ring and remembers that he last saw his wife Susan there when he sold her to a sailor in a drunken rage. Victorian poets who have referred to fairy rings in their works include Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Eliza Cook, Robert Stephen Hawker, Felicia Hemans, Gerald Massey, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson.W. H. Cummings composed the cantata &quot;The Fairy Ring&quot;, and William Butler Yeats wrote of them in &quot;The Land of Heart&#x27;s Desire&quot; (1894).

=== Art ===
Fairy circles have appeared in European artwork since at least the 18th century. For example, William Blake painted &quot;Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing&quot;, depicting a scene from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, around 1785, and Daniel Maclise painted &quot;Faun and the Fairies&quot; around 1834. Images of fairies dancing in circles became a favourite trope of painters in the Victorian period. On the one hand, artists were genuinely interested in the culture such imagery represented, and on the other, fairies could be depicted as titillating nudes and semi-nudes without offending Victorian mores, which made them a popular subject of art collectors. Examples of Victorian fairy-ring paintings include &quot;Come unto these Yellow Sands&quot; (1842) by Richard Dadd and &quot;Reconciliation of Titania and Oberon&quot; (1847) by Joseph Noel Paton.

<text>Fairy circles are circular patches of land barren of plants, varying between in diameter, often encircled by a ring of stimulated growth of grass. They occur in the arid grasslands of the Namib desert in western parts of Southern Africa, and in a part of the Pilbara in Western Australia. Studies have posited various hypotheses about their origins, but none have conclusively proven how they are formed. Theories include the activities of various types of termites, or the consequence of vegetation patterns that arise naturally from competition between grasses.

In the languages of the Aboriginal Australian peoples who inhabit the Pilbara, they are known as linyji (Manyjilyjarra language) or mingkirri (Warlpiri language).

== Location ==

Until 2014, the phenomenon was only known to occur in the arid grasslands of the Namib desert in western parts of Southern Africa, being particularly common in Namibia. In that year, ecologists were alerted to similar rings of vegetation outside Africa, in a part of the Pilbara in Western Australia.

In Africa, the circles occur in a band lying about inland, and extending southward from Angola for some down to the Northwestern Cape province of South Africa. It is largely a remote and inhospitable region, much of it over a hundred kilometres from the nearest village. The circles have been recognised and informally remarked on for many years, first being mentioned in technical literature in the 1920s and intermittently thereafter with the intensity of study increasing during the final quarter of the 20th century.

In 2014, fairy circles were first discovered outside Africa, outside of the town Newman, in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Australian environmental engineer Bronwyn Bell, alongside Stephan Getzin from the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research, released a paper in 2016, providing new insight into possible cause of the fairy circle formations.

Examples can be found at (Namibia) and (Western Australia)

==Description==
Fairy circles typically occur in essentially monospecific grassy vegetation, where conditions are particularly arid. Associated grasses commonly are species in the genus &quot;Stipagrostis&quot;. Studies show that these circles pass through a life cycle of some 30 to 60 years. They become noticeable at a diameter of about , achieving a peak diameter of perhaps , after which they mature and &quot;die&quot; as they undergo invasion, mainly by grasses.

In the languages of the Martu and Warlpiri peoples of Western Australia, fairy circles are known as &quot;linyji&quot; in the Manyjilyjarra language and &quot;mingkirri&quot; in the Warlpiri language. But from a scientific perspective, termite linyji are common vegetation gaps and not true fairy circles.

== Theories of formation ==

Like heuweltjies in South Africa and Mima mounds in the U.S., the cause of fairy circles has long been a puzzle and the investigation has proved challenging. Fairy circles in Namibia may be created in a different way from those in Australia, because they formed on sand rather than clay.

In 2004, University of Pretoria botanist Gretel van Rooyen rejected proposals of termite activity, radioactive soil, and of plant toxins. In 2008, Angelique Joubert proposed that residual plant toxins remaining in the soil after the death of &quot;Euphorbia damarana&quot; plants might be the cause of the barren interiors of the circles.

In 2012, Eugene Moll suggested the termite species &quot;Baucaliotermes hainsei&quot; and &quot;Psammotermes allocerus&quot; as the creator of these circles. All rings have been found to contain termite casts, and radar investigations suggest that a moist layer of soil is situated beneath the fairy circles.

In 2013, this theory was supported by Norbert Juergens. Juergens found evidence that the sand termite, &quot;Psammotermes allocerus&quot;, generates a local ecosystem that profits from and promotes the creation of the fairy circle. The sand termite was found in 80-100% of the circles, in 100% of newly formed circles, and was the only insect to live across the range of the phenomenon. Sand termites create the fairy circle by consuming vegetation and burrowing in the soil to create the ring. The barren circle allows water to percolate down through sandy soil and accumulate underground, allowing the soil to remain moist even under the driest conditions. Grass growth around the circle is promoted by the accumulated soil water, and in turn the termites feed on the grasses, slowly increasing the diameter of the circle. This behaviour on the part of &quot;Psammotermes allocerus&quot; amounts to creation of a local ecosystem in a manner analogous to behaviour of the common beaver.

Walter R. Tschinkel, a biologist at Florida State University, who also researched the fairy circles, remarked that Juergens &quot;has made the common scientific error of confusing correlation (even very strong correlation) with causation&quot;. Previously, Tschinkel had searched for harvester termites without success. Juergens responded that sand termites differ from harvester termites and live deep beneath the circle; they do not create mounds or nests above ground, and they leave no tracks in the sand. In such respects the sand termite is unusually inconspicuous in its activities.

Unresolved questions remain about the soil from the centre of the circle inhibiting plant growth and the interactions of other species in the fairy circle as they relate to the local ecosystem. The received wisdom from about a century ago remarked on the &quot;heuweltjies&quot; being anomalously rich in plant nutrients, raising the question of how many effectively different types or circumstances of circles or heuweltjies there might be.

Later in 2013, Michael Cramer and Nichole Barger suggested that the circles were the consequence of vegetation patterns that arose naturally from competition between grasses. They examined the conditions under which fairy circles arise and found that fairy circles are negatively correlated with precipitation and soil nutrition. This observation is consistent with resource competition being a cause of the circles. Grassy landscapes with a mixture of grasses can result in barren spots as a consequence of under-ground competition between different types of grasses. The patches are maintained because they form a reservoir of nutrients for the taller grasses at the periphery and possibly because of the activity of termites, as in the theory above. Using rainfall, biomass and temperature seasonality, they can predict with high accuracy the presence or absence of fairy circles in a region. According to Walter Tschinkel, this theory accounts for all the characteristics of fairy circles, including the presence of tall grass species. Other recent work has considered interacting combinations of both animal- and vegetation-induced patterning effects as a potential unifying theoretical explanation for the fairy circle phenomenon.

A 2015 theory about the Australian fairy circles suggested that the distinct vegetation patterns are a population-level consequence of competition for scarce water, as the plants &quot;organise&quot; themselves to maximise access to scarce resources. The circular barren patches capture water which then flows to the outer edges of the ring. More water available increases biomass and roots which leads to the soil becoming looser. The less dense soil allows more water to penetrate and feed the vegetation, creating a feedback loop supporting the plants at the edge of the circle. Field observations by Sujith Ravi, Lixin Wang and colleagues using soil moisture, soil particle size, and soil water infiltration measurements in Namibia in 2015 and 2016 support this.

In 2021 an explanation using hydrological feedbacks and the Turing mechanism was proposed as the cause of the patterns in Australia.

In 2022, a study was published that tested the termite theory and the theory of plant self-organization for Namibia by excavating hundreds of grasses within and around the fairy circles. The study revealed that the grasses within fairy circles died of plant-water stress but not due to root herbivory by termites because the roots were initially undamaged and as long or even longer than the roots of the vital grasses outside. Several fairy circle researchers stated that &quot;The new study showed “conclusively” that termites were not a factor&quot;.

In February 2023, weak seeps of hydrogen through faults, fractures, and diffused through rocks, were identified as a possible cause of the depressions. One researcher suggested that &quot;hydrogen-loving microbes&quot; may consume all other nutrients in the soil.
An Australian cross-cultural study published in April 2023, involving local Martu peoples and using their traditional knowledge of the phenomenon, are pavement nests occupied by &quot;Drepanotermes&quot; (Australian harvester termites). The research showed that the circles may have been created in the Pleistocene (over 12,000 years ago), and that termites lived in them and were continuing to build them. Aboriginal peoples have lived on the Australian continent for up to 65,000 years and have deep knowledge passed down through their oral traditions. However, this study did not account for the actual mechanism which causes the Australian fairy circles. Detailed research on the specific Australian fairy circles, conducted between 2014 and 2019, has shown that the bare-soil gaps are caused by abiotic weathering of the soil surface, resulting in clay crusts and inhibition of grass growth within the circles.

=== Birth and death ===
One interesting phenomenon of fairy circles is their &quot;birth and death&quot;, that is, their appearance and disappearance over time. In some cases, fairy circles have disappeared within a span of 10 years or less, while other fairy circles may have lasted for centuries. These births and deaths, taken over long time spans, can lead to regime shifts, such as desertification of this ecosystem. This means that these events may be indicative of a large-scale transformation of this landscape, so that observing fairy circles birth is indicative of a gradual desertification process taking place. Scientists have tried to test if such birth or death can occur due to intervention, for instance by changing the amount of water in the system..This, in turn, can potentially help determine the true cause of fairy circles.

=== Myths ===
In the oral myths of the Himba people of the Kunene Region of northern Namibia, these barren patches are said to have been caused by the gods, spirits and/or natural divinities. The region&#x27;s bushmen have traditionally ascribed spiritual and magical powers to them. Of specific beliefs, the Himba people note that their original ancestor, Mukuru, was responsible for the creation of the fairy circles, or that they were the footprints of gods.

Another myth put forth, promoted by some tour guides in Namibia, is that the circles are formed by a dragon in the earth and that its poisonous breath kills the vegetation.

== Use ==
The Himba people use the fairy circles in their agriculture. Because fairy circles support grasses in otherwise barren land, they provide grazing. Sometimes they erect temporary wooden fences around the circles to corral young cattle for overnight protection against predators.

<text>Maxie Cleveland Robinson Jr. (May 1, 1939 – December 20, 1988) was an American broadcast journalist, most notably serving as co-anchor on &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; alongside Frank Reynolds and Peter Jennings from 1978 until 1983. Robinson is noted as the first African-American broadcast network news anchor in the United States. Robinson was a founder of the National Association of Black Journalists.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Robinson was born the second of four children (a sister Jewell, who became a teacher; brother Randall, a Harvard-educated lawyer; and sister Jean, a publicist), of Maxie, a teacher and Doris Robinson in Richmond, Virginia. The schools in Richmond were still segregated when he attended; after graduating from Armstrong High School, Robinson attended Oberlin College, where he was freshman class president. However, he stayed there for only a year and a half and did not graduate. Robinson briefly served in the United States Air Force and was assigned to the Russian Language School at Indiana University before receiving a medical discharge. He began working in radio early on, including a short time at WSSV-AM in Petersburg, Virginia, where he called himself &quot;Max the Player&quot;, and later at WANT-AM, Richmond.

===Career===
Robinson began his television career in 1959, when he was hired for a news job at WTOV-TV in Portsmouth, Virginia. Robinson had to read the news while hidden behind a slide of the station&#x27;s logo. One night, Robinson had the slide removed; he was fired the next day.
He later went to WRC-TV in Washington, DC, and stayed for three years, winning six journalism awards for coverage of civil-rights events such as the riots that followed the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It was during this time that Robinson won two regional Emmys for a documentary he made on black life in Anacostia entitled &quot;The Other Washington&quot;. In 1969, Robinson joined the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; team at WTOP-TV (now WUSA-TV) in Washington, D.C. Robinson was teamed with anchor Gordon Peterson, becoming the first African-American anchor on a local television news program, and the newscast succeeded. During that time, he was so well-liked by viewers that when Hanafi Muslims took hostages at the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith building in Washington they would speak only with Robinson.

===ABC News and &quot;World News Tonight&quot;===
In 1978, when Roone Arledge was looking to revamp ABC&#x27;s nightly news broadcast into &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, he remembered Robinson from a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview, and hired him to be a part of his new three-anchor format. Robinson would anchor national news from Chicago, while Peter Jennings would anchor international news in London and Frank Reynolds would be the main anchor from Washington. Robinson thus became the first black man to anchor a nightly network news broadcast. The three-man co-anchor team was a ratings success, and launched spoofs regarding how the three would pitch stories to each other during the telecast by saying the other&#x27;s name: &quot;Frank&quot;...&quot;Max&quot;...&quot;Peter&quot;. 

Robinson&#x27;s ABC tenure was marked by conflicts between himself and the management of ABC News over viewpoints and the portrayal of Black America in the news. He was known by his co-workers to show up late for work or sometimes not show up at all; along with his moodiness, his use of alcohol escalated. In addition, Robinson was known to fight racism at any turn and often felt unworthy of the admiration he received and was not pleased with what he had accomplished. Together with Bob Strickland, Robinson established a program for mentoring young black broadcast journalists.

During most of Robinson&#x27;s tenure, ABC News used the Westar satellite to feed Robinson&#x27;s segment of &quot;WNT&quot; from Chicago to New York. TVRO receiver earth stations were also coming into use at the time, and anyone who knew where to find the satellite feeds could view the feed. On the live feed, Robinson could be seen to have a drink or two, but never during the actual aired segment, which led some bars around the country to even have drink specials during the nearly 90 minutes, and invited patrons to come in and see the &quot;Max &#x27;R&#x27;&quot; feed. ABC eventually caught on to what was happening, and even resorted to hide what was going on by supering a slide with the words &quot;ABC News Chicago&quot; on the screen during the live feed during times that Robinson was not live over the actual WNT broadcast. In addition, Robinson could often be seen being harsh towards people who worked around him during the live feed. Reynolds died in 1983, and shortly afterward Jennings was named sole anchor of &quot;World News Tonight&quot;; Robinson was relegated to the weekend anchor post, as well as reading hourly news briefs. 

Robinson left ABC in 1983 and joined WMAQ-TV in Chicago in March 1984; he was the station&#x27;s first black anchor. His tenure with the station was rocky, and he had conflicts with some of his colleagues. He was also frequently absent. He was fired from the network after attending a work-related event and never returning to the office. He had entered a drug treatment program at Hazelden, though allegedly without informing his superiors.

Robinson retired in 1985.

==Personal life==
===Marriages=== 
Robinson was married three times. Two ended in divorce, one in annulment. His first marriage was to Eleanor Booker from 1963 to 1968 and they had three children: Mark, Maureen, and Michael. His second marriage was to Hazel O&#x27;Leary from 1974 to 1975. Robinson&#x27;s final marriage was to Beverly Hamilton from 1977 to 1986, with whom he had another son, Malik. Robinson was the older brother of Randall Robinson.

===Health and death===
Robinson was found to have AIDS while he was hospitalized for pneumonia in Blue Island, Illinois, but he kept it a secret, refusing to discuss it, despite widespread rumors about why his health was deteriorating. In the fall of 1988, Robinson was in Washington to deliver a speech at Howard University&#x27;s School of Communications when he became increasingly ill. Robinson checked himself into Howard University Hospital where he died of complications due to AIDS on December 20, 1988. He had asked his family to reveal that he had AIDS so that, according to the new reports, &quot;Others in the black community would be alerted to the dangers and the need for treatment and education.&quot; He was buried at Lincoln Memorial Cemetery in Suitland, Maryland.

<doc id="449931" wikidata="Q565409" url="?curid=449931" title="Anne Hilarion de Tourville">
<text>Anne-Hilarion de Costentin, Comte de Tourville (; 24 November 1642 – 23 May 1701) was a French Navy officer and nobleman who served under King Louis XIV. Born in Paris, he was made a Marshal of France in 1693. Tourville is considered by some as one of the most talented naval officers in French military history.

==Military career==

At age 17, as a Knight of Malta, he fought his first naval battle on a frigate of the Order of Malta. At 25, he joined the French Royal Navy and began an active career, fighting the 1673 campaign of the Franco-Dutch War on the &quot;Sans-Pareil&quot;, at the Battle of Augusta where he was in command of the &quot;Syrene&quot;, and later in command of the &quot;Sceptre&quot;.

He served under Abraham Duquesne during the campaigns of 1676, and became a commander in 1690 during the Nine Years&#x27; War. He flew his personal flag on the &quot;Soleil Royal&quot;, where it would stay until the battles of Barfleur and La Hougue in 1692. At the Battle of Beachy Head in 1690, he defeated an Anglo-Dutch fleet, sinking, destroying or capturing seven enemy ships.

On 29 May 1692, at the action at Barfleur, with only 45 ships he fought against an Anglo-Dutch fleet of 97 ships, but was forced to retreat. His fleet suffered heavy losses after the battle when English and Dutch fire ships attacked several French ships of the line which were immobilized for repairs in port at Cherbourg-en-Cotentin. On 27 June 1693, he defeated an Anglo-Dutch convoy led by George Rooke during the Battle of Cape St. Vincent.

==Honours and tributes==

Tourville retired after the 1697 Peace of Ryswick and died in Paris on 23 May 1701, regarded as a national hero.

A number of French naval vessels from the 18th through 20th centuries were named in Tourville&#x27;s honour.
An 1816 marble statue of Admiral Tourville, by French sculptor Joseph Charles Marin, formerly in the Jardin de Versailles, features prominently in the Village of Tourville-sur-Seine (Normandy, Manche Département) hometown of Tourville ancestors, though Anne-Hilarion de Tourville himself was born in Paris and not in the ancestral castle of Tourville-sur-Sienne.

<text>Elliot Lovegood Grant Watson (14 June 1885 – 21 May 1970) was a writer and biologist. Among some 40 books and many essays and short stories he wrote six &#x27;Australian&#x27; novels and several scientific-philosophical works that challenge Darwinism, or the mechanism of evolutionary theory, as an entire explanation for the development of life on earth.

==Biography==

Born at Staines, Middlesex in England, the son of a successful London barrister, Reginald Grant Watson, and Lucy, née Fuller, a strong-minded woman with an interest in natural history and literature, &#x27;Peter&#x27; (as he was called) visited Australia first as a child in 1890, soon after the death of his younger brother. During this visit, to relatives in Tasmania, his father also died. In rather more impoverished circumstances, Grant Watson was educated at Bedales School and Trinity College, Cambridge (B.A., 1909, with first-class honours in natural sciences) after which, at 24, he joined social anthropologist Alfred Brown (later Alfred Radcliffe-Brown) and Daisy Bates on an ethnological expedition in Western Australia. His experiences in the desert country at Southern Cross (near Kalgoorlie) and at Sandstone in the Murchison region, and later at the Aboriginal lock hospitals of Shark Bay, determined him to become a writer.

After further travels in Fiji, Canada and Ceylon he enlisted in the British Army but after a mental breakdown was seconded to perform biological research with parasitologist Clifford Dobell the Burroughs-Wellcome laboratory for tropical diseases in London. Later he taught officer cadets at a private college in Storrington.

On 17 July 1919 at Hampstead registry office he married Katharine Hannay.

During his writing career, by nature restless, he moved between a succession of homes in the English countryside and the expatriate colonies of pre-war Florence and Paris; through Bohemian London and prohibition New York, to Palestine and the Arctic Circle, while navigating friendships with writers Joseph Conrad, Gertrude Stein, Havelock Ellis, D.H. Lawrence; poets Rupert Brooke, Edward Thomas and Ferenc Békássy, the psychologist Helton Godwin Baynes, Geoffrey Keynes, Mabel Dodge Luhan, naturalist Frank Fraser Darling, and—in later life—Owen Barfield and Carl Jung.

Grant Watson&#x27;s works include fiction, nature essays (many illustrated by Charles Tunnicliffe), travel writing and metaphysical and philosophical studies. His Australian novels are important for their pioneering use of the desert as a metaphor for the Jungian subconscious, and prefigured aspects of the works of such Australian writers as Katharine Susannah Prichard, Patrick White and Randolph Stow, particularly in their early sympathy with Aboriginal and environmental interpretations of the landscape. His autobiographical works &quot;But to What Purpose: The Autobiography of a Contemporary&quot; (1946) and &quot;Journey Under the Southern Stars&quot; (1968) give vivid accounts of his physical and intellectual journeys. In later life he also supported himself through BBC radio broadcasts, extramural university lectures and practice as a lay psychologist.

Survived by his wife Katharine and two daughters Josephine and Bridget, Grant Watson died at Petersfield, Hampshire, on 21 May 1970 and was buried in nearby Steep churchyard under an oak marker, intended to last only as long as an oak tree.

After his death, the internationally known filmmaker Paul Cox based two feature films on his Australian works: &quot;The Nun and The Bandit&quot; (1992, based on the 1935 novel of the same name) and &quot;Exile&quot; (1994, based on the 1940 novel &quot;Priest Island&quot;). A collection of his writings, &quot;Descent of Spirit&quot;, edited by the Australian literary scholar Dorothy Green (Auchterlonie), was published in 1990. A biography, &quot;The Imago: E. L. Grant Watson &amp; Australia&quot;, by Suzanne Falkiner, was released by UWA Publishing in 2011.

<doc id="449934" wikidata="Q14096331" url="?curid=449934" title="Dairy farming">
<text>Dairy farming is a class of agriculture for the long-term production of milk, which is processed (either on the farm or at a dairy plant, either of which may be called a dairy) for the eventual sale of a dairy product. Dairy farming has a history that goes back to the early Neolithic era, around the seventh millennium BC, in many regions of Europe and Africa. Before the 20th century, milking was done by hand on small farms. Beginning in the early 20th century, milking was done in large scale dairy farms with innovations including rotary parlors, the milking pipeline, and automatic milking systems that were commercially developed in the early 1990s.

Milk preservation methods have improved starting with the arrival of refrigeration technology in the late 19th century, which included direct expansion refrigeration and the plate heat exchanger. These cooling methods allowed dairy farms to preserve milk by reducing spoiling due to bacterial growth and humidity.

Worldwide, leading dairy industries in many countries including India, the United States, China, and New Zealand serve as important producers, exporters, and importers of milk. Since the late 20th century, there has generally been an increase in total milk production worldwide, with around 827,884,000 tonnes of milk being produced in 2017 according to the FAO.

There has been substantial concern over the amount of waste output created by dairy industries, seen through manure disposal and air pollution caused by methane gas. The industry&#x27;s role in agricultural greenhouse gas emissions has also been noted to implicate environmental consequences. Various measures have been put in place in order to control the amount of phosphorus excreted by dairy livestock. The usage of rBST has also been controversial. Dairy farming in general has been criticized by animal welfare activists due to the health issues imposed upon dairy cows through intensive animal farming.

== Common types ==
Although any mammal can produce milk, commercial dairy farms are typically one-species enterprises. In developed countries, dairy farms typically consist of high producing dairy cows. Other species used in commercial dairy farming include goats, sheep, water buffaloes, and camels. In Italy, donkey dairies are growing in popularity to produce an alternative milk source for human infants.

==History==
While cattle were domesticated as early as 12,000 years ago as a food source and as beasts of burden, the earliest evidence of using domesticated cows for dairy production is from the seventh millennium BC – the early Neolithic era – in northwestern Anatolia. Dairy farming developed elsewhere in the world in subsequent centuries: the sixth millennium BC in eastern Europe, the fifth millennium BC in Africa, and the fourth millennium BC in Britain and Northern Europe.

In the last century or so larger farms specialising in dairy alone have emerged. Large scale dairy farming is only viable where either a large amount of milk is required for production of more durable dairy products such as cheese, butter, etc. or there is a substantial market of people with money to buy milk, but no cows of their own. In the 1800s von Thünen argued that there was about a 100-mile radius surrounding a city where such fresh milk supply was economically viable.

===Hand milking===
Centralized dairy farming as we understand it primarily developed around villages and cities, where residents were unable to have cows of their own due to a lack of grazing land. Near the town, farmers could make some extra money on the side by having additional animals and selling the milk in town. The dairy farmers would fill barrels with milk in the morning and bring it to market on a wagon. Until the late 19th century, the milking of the cow was done by hand. In the United States, several large dairy operations existed in some northeastern states and in the west, that involved as many as several hundred cows, but an individual milker could not be expected to milk more than a dozen cows a day. Smaller operations predominated.

For most herds, milking took place indoors twice a day, in a barn with the cattle tied by the neck with ropes or held in place by stanchions. Feeding could occur simultaneously with milking in the barn, although most dairy cattle were pastured during the day between milkings. Such examples of this method of dairy farming are difficult to locate, but some are preserved as a historic site for a glimpse into the days gone by. One such instance that is open for this is at Point Reyes National Seashore.

Dairy farming has been part of agriculture for thousands of years. Historically it has been one part of small, diverse farms. In the last century or so larger farms concentrating on dairy production emerged. Large scale dairy farming is only viable where either a large amount of milk is required for production of more durable dairy products such as cheese, butter, etc. or there is a substantial market of people with cash to buy milk, but no cows of their own. Dairy farms were the best way to meet demand.

===Vacuum bucket milking===
The first milking machines were an extension of the traditional milking pail. The early milker device fit on top of a regular milk pail and sat on the floor under the cow. Following each cow being milked, the bucket would be dumped into a holding tank. These were introduced in the early 20th century.

This developed into the Surge hanging milker. Prior to milking a cow, a large wide leather strap called a surcingle was put around the cow, across the cow&#x27;s lower back. The milker device and collection tank hung underneath the cow from the strap. This innovation allowed the cow to move around naturally during the milking process rather than having to stand perfectly still over a bucket on the floor.

===Milking pipeline===

The next innovation in automatic milking was the milk pipeline, introduced in the late 20th century. This uses a permanent milk-return pipe and a second vacuum pipe that encircles the barn or milking parlor above the rows of cows, with quick-seal entry ports above each cow. By eliminating the need for the 
milk container, the milking device shrank in size and weight to the point where it could hang under the cow, held up only by the sucking force of the milker nipples on the cow&#x27;s udder. The milk is pulled up into the milk-return pipe by the vacuum system, and then flows by gravity to the milkhouse vacuum-breaker that puts the milk in the storage tank. The pipeline system greatly reduced the physical labor of milking since the farmer no longer needed to carry around huge heavy buckets of milk from each cow.

The pipeline allowed barn length to keep increasing and expanding, but after a point farmers started to milk the cows in large groups, filling the barn with one-half to one-third of the herd, milking the animals, and then emptying and refilling the barn. As herd sizes continued to increase, this evolved into the more efficient milking parlor.

===Milking parlors===
Innovation in milking focused on mechanizing the milking parlor (known in Australia and New Zealand as the &#x27;cowshed&#x27;) to maximize the number of cows per operator which streamlined the milking process to permit cows to be milked as if on an assembly line, and to reduce physical stresses on the farmer by putting the cows on a platform slightly above the person milking the cows to eliminate having to constantly bend over. Many older and smaller farms still have tie-stall or stanchion barns, but worldwide a majority of commercial farms have parlors.

====Herringbone and parallel parlors====
In herringbone and parallel parlors, the milker generally milks one row at a time. The milker will move a row of cows from the holding yard into the milking parlor, and milk each cow in that row. Once all of the milking machines have been removed from the milked row, the milker releases the cows to their feed. A new group of cows is then loaded into the now vacant side and the process repeats until all cows are milked. Depending on the size of the milking parlor, which normally is the bottleneck, these rows of cows can range from four to sixty at a time. The benefits of a herringbone parlour are easy maintenance, the durability, stability, and improved safety for animals and humans when compared to tie stall The first herringbone shed is thought to have been built in 1952 by a Gordonton farmer.

====Rotary parlors====

In rotary parlors, the cows are loaded one at a time onto the parlor as the whole thing rotates in a circle. One milker stands near the entry to the parlor and pre-dips the teats on the udder to help prevent bacteria from entering. The next milker puts the machine on the cow to begin milking. By the time the platform has completed almost a full rotation, the cow is done milking and the unit will come off automatically. The last milker will post-dip her teats to protect them before entering back into the pen. Once this process is done, the cow will back out of the parlor and return to the barn. Rotary cowsheds, as they are called in New Zealand, started in the 1980s but are expensive compared to Herringbone cowshed – the older New Zealand norm.

===Automatic milker take-off===
It can be harmful to an animal for it to be over-milked past the point where the udder has stopped releasing milk. Consequently, the milking process involves not just applying the milker, but also monitoring the process to determine when the animal has been &quot;milked out&quot; and the milker should be removed. While parlor operations allowed a farmer to milk many more animals much more quickly, it also increased the number of animals to be monitored simultaneously by the farmer. The automatic take-off system was developed to remove the milker from the cow when the milk flow reaches a preset level, relieving the farmer of the duties of carefully watching over 20 or more animals being milked at the same time.

===Fully automated robotic milking===
In the 1980s and 1990s, robotic milking systems were developed and introduced (principally in the EU). Thousands of these systems are now in routine operation. In these systems the cow has a high degree of autonomy to choose her time of milking freely during the day (some alternatives may apply, depending on cow-traffic solution used at a farm level). These systems are generally limited to intensively managed systems although research continues to match them to the requirements of grazing cattle and to develop sensors to detect animal health and fertility automatically. Every time the cow enters the milking unit she is fed concentrates and her collar is scanned to record production data.

==History of milk preservation methods==

Cool temperature has been the main method by which milk freshness has been extended. When windmills and well pumps were invented, one of their first uses on the farm, besides providing water for animals themselves, was for cooling milk, to extend its storage life, until it would be transported to the town market.

The naturally cold underground water would be continuously pumped into a cooling tub or vat. Tall, ten-gallon metal containers filled with freshly obtained milk, which is naturally warm, were placed in this cooling bath. This method of milk cooling was popular before the arrival of electricity and refrigeration.

===Refrigeration===
When refrigeration first the equipment was initially used to cool cans of milk, which were filled by hand milking. These cans were placed into a cooled water bath to remove heat and keep them cool until they were able to be transported to collect facilities. As more automated methods were developed for eating milk, hand milking was replaced and, as a result, the milk can was replaced by a bulk milk cooler. &#x27;Ice banks&#x27; were the first type of bulk milk cooler. This was a double wall vessel with evaporator coils and water located between the walls at the bottom and sides of the tank. A small refrigeration compressor was used to remove heat from the evaporator coils. Ice eventually builds up around the coils, until it reaches a thickness of about three inches surrounding each pipe, and the cooling system shuts off. When the milking operation starts, only the milk agitator and the water circulation pump, which flows water across the ice and the steel walls of the tank, are needed to reduce the incoming milk to a temperature below 5 degrees.

This cooling method worked well for smaller dairies, however was fairly inefficient and was unable to meet the increasingly higher cooling demand of larger milking parlors. In the mid-1950s direct expansion refrigeration was first applied directly to the bulk milk cooler. This type of cooling utilizes an evaporator built directly into the inner wall of the storage tank to remove heat from the milk. Direct expansion is able to cool milk at a much faster rate than early ice bank type coolers and is still the primary method for bulk tank cooling today on small to medium-sized operations.

Another device which has contributed significantly to milk quality is the plate heat exchanger (PHE). This device utilizes a number of specially designed stainless steel plates with small spaces between them. Milk is passed between every other set of plates with water being passed between the balance of the plates to remove heat from the milk. This method of cooling can remove large amounts of heat from the milk in a very short time, thus drastically slowing bacteria growth and thereby improving milk quality. Ground water is the most common source of cooling medium for this device. Dairy cows consume approximately 3 gallons of water for every gallon of milk production and prefer to drink slightly warm water as opposed to cold ground water. For this reason, PHE&#x27;s can result in drastically improved milk quality, reduced operating costs for the dairymen by reducing the refrigeration load on his bulk milk cooler, and increased milk production by supplying the cows with a source of fresh warm water.

Plate heat exchangers have also evolved as a result of the increase of dairy farm herd sizes in the United States. As a dairyman increases the size of his herd, he must also increase the capacity of his milking parlor in order to harvest the additional milk. This increase in parlor sizes has resulted in tremendous increases in milk throughput and cooling demand. Today&#x27;s larger farms produce milk at a rate which direct expansion refrigeration systems on bulk milk coolers cannot cool in a timely manner. PHE&#x27;s are typically utilized in this instance to rapidly cool the milk to the desired temperature (or close to it) before it reaches the bulk milk tank. Typically, ground water is still utilized to provide some initial cooling to bring the milk to between . A second (and sometimes third) section of the PHE is added to remove the remaining heat with a mixture of chilled pure water and propylene glycol. These chiller systems can be made to incorporate large evaporator surface areas and high chilled water flow rates to cool high flow rates of milk.

==Milking operation==

Milking machines are held in place automatically by a vacuum system that draws the ambient air pressure down from of vacuum. The vacuum is also used to lift milk vertically through small diameter hoses, into the receiving can. A milk lift pump draws the milk from the receiving can through large diameter stainless steel piping, through the plate cooler, then into a refrigerated bulk tank.

Milk is extracted from the cow&#x27;s udder by flexible rubber sheaths known as liners or inflations that are surrounded by a rigid air chamber. A pulsating flow of ambient air and vacuum is applied to the inflation&#x27;s air chamber during the milking process. When ambient air is allowed to enter the chamber, the vacuum inside the inflation causes the inflation to collapse around the cow&#x27;s teat, squeezing the milk out of teat in a similar fashion as a baby calf&#x27;s mouth massaging the teat. When the vacuum is reapplied in the chamber the flexible rubber inflation relaxes and opens up, preparing for the next squeezing cycle.

It takes the average cow three to five minutes to give her milk. Some cows are faster or slower. Slow-milking cows may take up to fifteen minutes to let down all their milk. Though milking speed is not related to the quality of milk produced by the cow, it does impact the management of the milking process. Because most milkers milk cattle in groups, the milker can only process a group of cows at the speed of the slowest-milking cow. For this reason, many farmers will group slow-milking cows so as not to stress the faster milking cows.

The extracted milk passes through a strainer and plate heat exchangers before entering the tank, where it can be stored safely for a few days at approximately . At pre-arranged times, a milk truck arrives and pumps the milk from the tank for transport to a dairy factory where it will be pasteurized and processed into many products. The frequency of pick up depends and the production and storage capacity of the dairy; large dairies will have milk pick-ups once per day.

==Management of the herd==
The dairy industry is a constantly evolving business. Management practices change with new technology and regulations that move the industry toward increased economic and environmental sustainability. Management strategies can also loosely be divided into intensive and extensive systems. Extensive systems operate based on a low input and low output philosophy, where intensive systems adopt a high input high output philosophy. These philosophies as well as available technologies, local regulations, and environmental conditions manifest in different management of nutrition, housing, health, reproduction and waste.

Most modern dairy farms divide the animals into different management units depending on their age, nutritional needs, reproductive status, and milk production status. The group of cows that are currently lactating, the milking herd, is often managed most intensively to make sure their diet and environmental conditions are conducive to producing as much high quality milk as possible. On some farms the milking herd is further divided into milking strings, which are groups of animals with different nutritional needs. The segment of the adult herd that are in the resting period before giving birth to their next calf are called dry cows because they are not being milked. All female animals that have yet to give birth to their first calf are called heifers. Some of them will grow up to take the place of older animals in the milking herd and thus are sometimes generally referred to as the replacement herd. The others, as well as most male calves are considered surplus dairy calves and are slaughtered for meat, such as veal dairy beef, or killed on farm.

===Housing systems===
Dairy cattle housing systems vary greatly throughout the world depending on the climate, dairy size, and feeding strategies. Housing must provide access to feed, water and protection from relevant environmental conditions. One issue for housing cattle is temperature extremes. Heat stress can decrease fertility and milk production in cattle. Providing shade is a very common method for reducing heat stress. Barns may also incorporate fans or tunnel ventilation into the architecture of the barn structure. Overly cold conditions, while rarely deadly for cattle, cause increases in maintenance energy requirements and thus increased feed intake and decreased milk production. During the winter months, where temperatures are low enough, dairy cattle are often kept inside barns which are warmed by their collective body heat.

Feed provision is also an important feature of dairy housing. Pasture based dairies are a more extensive option where cows are turned out to graze on pasture when the weather permits. Often the diet must be supplemented with when poor pasture conditions persist. Free stall barns and open lots are intensive housing options where feed is brought to the cattle at all times of year. Free stall barns are designed to allow the cows freedom to choose when they feed, rest, drink, or stand. They can be either fully enclosed or open air barns again depending on the climate. The resting areas, called free stalls, are divided beds lined with anything from mattresses to sand. In the lanes between rows of stalls, the floor is often make of grooved concrete. Most barns open onto uncovered corrals, which the cattle are free to enjoy as the weather allows. Open lots are dirt lots with constructed shade structures and a concrete pad where feed is delivered.

===Milking systems===

Life on a dairy farm revolves around the milking parlor. Each lactating cow will visit the parlor at least twice a day to be milked. A remarkable amount of engineering has gone into designing milking parlors and milking machines. Efficiency is crucial; every second saved while milking a single cow adds up to hours over the whole herd.

====Milking machines====
Milking is now performed almost exclusively by machine, though human technicians are still essential on most facilities. The most common milking machine is called a cluster milker. This milker consists of four metal cupsone per teateach lined with rubber or silicone. The cluster is attached to both a milk collection system and a pulsating vacuum system. When the vacuum is on, it pulls air from between the outer metal cup and the liner, drawing milk out of the teat. When the vacuum turns off, it gives the teat an opportunity to refill with milk. In most milking systems, a milking technician must attach the cluster to each cow, but the machine senses when the cow has been fully milked and drops off independently.

====Milking routine====
Every time a cow enters the parlor several things need to happen to ensure milk quality and cow health. First, the cow&#x27;s udder must be cleaned and disinfected to prevent both milk contamination and udder infections. Then the milking technician must check each teat for signs of infection by observing the first stream of milk. During this processes, called stripping the teat, the milking technician is looking for any discoloration or chunkiness that would indicate mastitis, an infection in the cow&#x27;s mammary gland. Milk from a cow with mastitis cannot enter the human milk supply, thus farmers must be careful that infected milk does not mix with the milk from healthy cows and that the cow gets the necessary treatment. If the cow passes the mastitis inspection, the milking technician will attach the milking cluster. The cluster will run until the cow is fully milked and then drop off. The milk travels immediately through a cooling system and then into a large cooled storage tank, where it will stay until picked up by a refrigerated milk truck. Before the cow is released from the milking stalls her teats are disinfected one last time to prevent infection.

===Nutritional management===
Feed for their cattle is by far one of the largest expenses for dairy producer whether it be provided by the land they graze or crops grown or purchased. Pasture based dairy producers invest much time and effort into maintaining their pastures and thus feed for their cattle. Pasture management techniques such as rotational grazing are common for dairy production. Many large dairies that deliver food to their cattle have a dedicated nutritionist who is responsible for formulating diets with animal health, milk production, and cost efficiency in mind. For maximum productivity diets must be formulated differently depending on the growth rate, milk production, and reproductive status of each animal.

Cattle are classified as ruminants (suborder belonging to the order ) as they are able to acquire nutrients from even low quality plant-based food, thanks mainly to their symbiotic relationship with the microbes that ferment it in a chamber of their stomachs called the rumen. The rumen is a literal micro-ecosystem within each dairy cow. For optimal digestion, the environment of the rumen must be ideal for the microbes. In this way, the job of a ruminant nutritionist is to feed the microbes not the cow.

The nutritional requirements of cattle are usually divided into maintenance requirements, which depend on the cow&#x27;s weight; and milk production requirements, which in turn depend on the volume of milk the cow is producing. The nutritional contents of each available feed are used to formulate a diet that meets all nutritional needs in the most cost effective way. Notably, cattle must be fed a diet high in fiber to maintain a proper environment for the rumen microbes. Farmers typically grow their own forage for their cattle. Crops grown may include corn, alfalfa, timothy, wheat, oats, sorghum and clover. These plants are often processed after harvest to preserve or improve nutrient value and prevent spoiling. Corn, alfalfa, wheat, oats, and sorghum crops are often anaerobically fermented to create silage. Many crops such as alfalfa, timothy, oats, and clover are allowed to dry in the field after cutting before being baled into hay.

To increase the energy density of their diet, cattle are commonly fed cereal grains. In many areas of the world, dairy rations also commonly include byproducts from other agricultural sectors. For example, in California cattle are commonly fed almond hulls and cotton seed. Feeding of byproducts can reduce the environmental impact of other agricultural sectors by keeping these materials out of landfills.

To meet all of their nutritional requirements cows must eat their entire ration. Unfortunately, much like humans, cattle have their favorite foods. To keep cattle from selectively eating the most desirable parts of the diet, most produces feed a total mixed ration (TMR). In this system all the components of the feed are well mixed in a mixing truck before being delivered to the cattle. Different TMRs are often prepared for groups of cows with different nutritional requirements.

===Reproductive management===
Female calves born on a dairy farm will typically be raised as replacement stock to take the place of older cows that are no longer sufficiently productive. The life of a dairy cow is a cycle of pregnancy and lactation starting at puberty. The timing of these events is very important to the production capacity of the dairy. A cow will not produce milk until she has given birth to a calf. Consequently, timing of the first breeding as well as all the subsequent breeding is important for maintaining milk production levels.

====Puberty and first breeding====
Most dairy producers aim for a replacement heifer to give birth to her first calf, and thus join the milking herd, on her second birthday. As the cow&#x27;s gestation period is a little over 9 months this means the cow must be inseminated by the age of 15 months. Because the breeding process is inefficient, most producers aim to first breed their heifers between 12 and 14 months. Before a heifer can be bred she must reach sexual maturity and attain the proper body condition to successfully bear a calf. Puberty in cattle depends largely on weight among other factors. Holstein heifers reach puberty at an average body weight between 550 and 650 lbs. Smaller breeds of cattle, such as Jerseys, usually reach puberty earlier at a lighter weight. Under typical nutritional conditions, Holstein heifers will reach puberty at the age 9–10 months. Proper body condition for breeding is also largely judged by weight. At about 800lbs Holstein heifers will normally be able to carry a healthy calf and give birth with relative ease. In this way, the heifers will be able to give birth and join the milking herd before their second birthday.

====Estrous cycle====
Puberty coincides with the beginning of estrous cycles. Estrous cycles are the recurring hormonal and physiological changes that occur within the bodies of most mammalian females that lead to ovulation and the development of a suitable environment for embryonic and fetal growth. The cow is considered polyestrous, which means that she will continue to undergo regular estrous cycles until death unless the cycle is interrupted by a pregnancy.

In cows, a complete estrous cycle lasts 21 days. Most commonly, dairy producers discuss the estrous cycle as beginning when the cow is receptive to breeding. This short phase lasting only about a day is also known as estrus or colloquially, heat. The cow will often exhibit several behavioral changes during this phase including increased activity and vocalizations. Most importantly, during estrus she will stand still when mounted by another cow or bull.

====Mating and pregnancy====
In the United States, artificial insemination (AI) is a very important reproductive tool used on dairy facilities. AI, is the process by which sperm is deliberately delivered by dairy managers or veterinarians into the cow&#x27;s uterus. Bulls “donate” semen at a stud farm but there is never any physical contact between the cow and the bull when using this method.

This method of insemination quickly gained popularity among dairy producers for several reasons. Dairy bulls are notoriously dangerous to keep on the average dairy facility. AI also makes it possible to speed the genetic improvement of the dairy herd because every dairy farmer has access to sperm from genetically superior sires. Additionally, AI has been shown to reduce spread of venereal diseases within herd that would ultimately lead to fertility problems. Many producers also find it to be more economical than keeping a bull. On the other hand, AI does require more intensive reproductive management of the herd as well as more time and expertise. Detection of estrus, becomes reliant on observation in the absence of bulls. It takes considerable expertise to properly inseminate a cow and high quality sperm is valuable. Ultimately, because dairy production was already a management intensive industry the disadvantages are dwarfed by the advantages of the AI for many dairy producers.

The majority of cows carry a single calf. Pregnancy lasts an average of 280 to 285 days or a little less than 9 and one half months.

===Lactation management===
After the birth of a calf the cow begins to lactate. Lactation will normally continue for as long as the cow is milked but production will steadily decline. Dairy farmers are extremely familiar with the pattern of milk production and carefully time the cow&#x27;s next breeding to maximize milk production. The pattern of lactation and pregnancy is known as the lactation cycle.

For a period of 20 days post parturition the cow is called a fresh cow. Milk production quickly increases during this phase but milk composition is also significantly different from the rest of the cycle. This first milk, called colostrum, is rich in fats, protein, and also maternal immune cells. This colostrum is not usually commercially sold, but is extremely important for early calf nutrition. Perhaps most importantly, it conveys passive immunity to the calf before its immune system is fully developed.

The next 30 to 60 days of the lactation cycle is characterized by peak milk production levels. The amount of milk produced per day during this period varies considerably by breed and by individual cow depending on her body condition, genetics, health, and nutrition. During this period the body condition of the cow will suffer because the cow will draw on her body stores to maintain such high milk production. Food intake of the cow also will increase. After peak lactation, the cow&#x27;s milk production levels will slowly decline for the rest of the lactation cycle. The producer will often breed the cow soon after she leaves peak production. For a while, the cow&#x27;s food intake will remain high before also beginning a decline to pre lactation levels. After peak milk production her body condition will also steadily recover.

Producers will typically continue to milk the cow until she is two months away from parturition then they will dry her off. Giving the cow a break during the final stages of pregnancy allows her mammary gland to regress and re-develop, her body condition to recover, and the calf to develop normally. Decreased body condition in the cow means she will not be as productive in subsequent milk cycles. Decreased health in the new born calf will negatively impact the quality of the replacement herd. There is also evidence that increased rates of mammary cell proliferation occur during the dry period that is essential to maintaining high production levels in subsequent lactation cycles.

===Animal waste from large cattle dairies===
As measured in phosphorus, the waste output of 5,000 cows roughly equals a municipality of 70,000 people. In the U.S., dairy operations with more than 1,000 cows meet the EPA definition of a CAFO (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation), and are subject to EPA regulations. For example, in the San Joaquin Valley of California a number of dairies have been established on a very large scale. Each dairy consists of several modern milking parlor set-ups operated as a single enterprise. Each milking parlor is surrounded by a set of 3 or 4 loafing barns housing 1,500 or 2,000 cattle. Some of the larger dairies have planned 10 or more series of loafing barns and milking parlors in this arrangement, so that the total operation may include as many as 15,000 or 20,000 cows. The milking process for these dairies is similar to a smaller dairy with a single milking parlor but repeated several times. The size and concentration of cattle creates major environmental issues associated with manure handling and disposal, which requires substantial areas of cropland (a ratio of 5 or 6 cows to the acre, or several thousand acres for dairies of this size) for manure spreading and dispersion, or several-acre methane digesters. Air pollution from methane gas associated with manure management also is a major concern. As a result, proposals to develop dairies of this size can be controversial and provoke substantial opposition from environmentalists including the Sierra Club and local activists.

The potential impact of large dairies was demonstrated when a massive manure spill occurred on a 5,000-cow dairy in Upstate New York, contaminating a stretch of the Black River, and killing 375,000 fish. On 10 August 2005, a manure storage lagoon collapsed releasing of manure into the Black River. Subsequently, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation mandated a settlement package of $2.2 million against the dairy.

When properly managed, dairy and other livestock waste, due to its nutrient content (N, P, K), makes an excellent fertilizer promoting crop growth, increasing soil organic matter, and improving overall soil fertility and tilth characteristics. Most dairy farms in the United States are required to develop nutrient management plans for their farms, to help balance the flow of nutrients and reduce the risks of environmental pollution. These plans encourage producers to monitor all nutrients coming onto the farm as feed, forage, animals, fertilizer, etc. and all nutrients exiting the farm as product, crop, animals, manure, etc. For example, a precision approach to animal feeding results in less overfeeding of nutrients and a subsequent decrease in environmental excretion of nutrients, such as phosphorus. In recent years, nutritionists have realized that requirements for phosphorus are much lower than previously thought. These changes have allowed dairy producers to reduce the amount of phosphorus being fed to their cows with a reduction in environmental pollution.

===Use of hormones===

It is possible to maintain higher milk production by supplementing cows with growth hormones known as recombinant BST or rBST, but this is controversial due to its effects on animal and possibly human health. The European Union, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada have banned its use due to these concerns.

In the US however, no such prohibition exists, but rBST is not used on dairy farms. Most dairy processors, if not all, will not accept milk with rBST. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration states that no &quot;significant difference&quot; has been found between milk from treated and non-treated cows but based on consumer concerns several milk purchasers and resellers have elected not to purchase milk produced with rBST.


===Animal welfare===
The practice of dairy production in a factory farm environment has been criticized by animal welfare activists. Some of the ethical complaints regarding dairy production cited include how often the dairy cattle must remain pregnant, the separation of calves from their mothers, how dairy cattle are housed and environmental concerns regarding dairy production.

The production of milk requires that the cow be in lactation, which is a result of the cow having given birth to a calf. The cycle of insemination, pregnancy, parturition, and lactation, followed by a &quot;dry&quot; period of about two months of forty-five to fifty days, before calving which allows udder tissue to regenerate. A dry period that falls outside this time frame can result in decreased milk production in subsequent lactation.

An important part of the dairy industry is the removal of the calves off the mother&#x27;s milk after the three days of needed colostrum, allowing for the collection of the milk produced. On some dairies, in order for this to take place, the calves are fed milk replacer, a substitute for the whole milk produced by the cow. Milk replacer is generally a powder, which comes in large bags, and is added to precise amounts of water, and then fed to the calf via bucket, bottle or automated feeder.

Milk replacers are classified by three categories: protein source, protein/fat (energy) levels, and medication or additives (e.g. vitamins and minerals). Proteins for the milk replacer come from different sources; the more favorable and more expensive all milk protein (e.g. whey protein- a by-product of the cheese industry) and alternative proteins including soy, animal plasma and wheat gluten. The ideal levels for fat and protein in milk replacer are 10-28% and 18-30%, respectively. 
The higher the energy levels (fat and protein), the less starter feed (feed which is given to young animals) the animal will consume. Weaning can take place when a calf is consuming at least two pounds of starter feed a day and has been on starter for at least three weeks. 
Milk replacer has climbed in cost US$15–20 a bag in recent years, so early weaning is economically crucial to effective calf management.

Common ailments affecting dairy cows include infectious disease (e.g. mastitis, endometritis and digital dermatitis), metabolic disease (e.g. milk fever and ketosis) and injuries caused by their environment (e.g. hoof and hock lesions).

Lameness is commonly considered one of the most significant animal welfare issues for dairy cattle, and is best defined as any abnormality that causes an animal to change its gait. It can be caused by a number of sources, including infections of the hoof tissue (e.g. fungal infections that cause dermatitis) and physical damage causing bruising or lesions (e.g. ulcers or hemorrhage of the hoof). 
Housing and management features common in modern dairy farms (such as concrete barn floors, limited access to pasture and suboptimal bed-stall design) have been identified as contributing risk factors to infections and injuries.

===Greenhouse gas emissions===

Milk is estimated to have been responsible for 18% of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in 2014.

==Market==

=== Worldwide ===

There is a great deal of variation in the pattern of dairy production worldwide. Many countries which are large producers consume most of this internally, while others (in particular New Zealand), export a large percentage of their production. Internal consumption is often in the form of liquid milk, while the bulk of international trade is in processed dairy products such as milk powder.

The milking of cows was traditionally a labor-intensive operation and still is in less developed countries. Small farms need several people to milk and care for only a few dozen cows, though for many farms these employees have traditionally been the children of the farm family, giving rise to the term &quot;family farm&quot;.

Advances in technology have mostly led to the radical redefinition of &quot;family farms&quot; in industrialized countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. With farms of hundreds of cows producing large volumes of milk, the larger and more efficient dairy farms are more able to weather severe changes in milk price and operate profitably, while &quot;traditional&quot; family farms generally do not have the equity or income other larger scale farms do. The common public perception of large corporate farms supplanting smaller ones is generally a misconception, as many small family farms expand to take advantage of economies of scale, and incorporate the business to limit the legal liabilities of the owners and simplify such things as tax management.The transition from family farms to farms with employed staff who carry out the day-to-day management of the herd&#x27;s animals has changed the farmer&#x27;s duties and role on the farm. New questions have arisen concerning how the development of bigger farms places greater demands on strategies focused on financial control, leadership, and personnel issues.

Before large scale mechanization arrived in the 1950s, keeping a dozen milk cows for the sale of milk was profitable. Now most dairies must have more than one hundred cows being milked at a time in order to be profitable, with other cows and heifers waiting to be &quot;freshened&quot; to join the milking herd. In New Zealand, the average herd size increased from 113 cows in the 1975–76 season to 435 cows in 2018–19 season.

Worldwide, the largest cow milk producer is the United States, the largest cow milk exporter is New Zealand, and the largest importer is China. The European Union with its present 27 member countries produced in 2013(96.8% cow milk), the most by any politico-economic union.

=== Supply management ===
The Canadian dairy industry is one of four sectors that is under the supply management system, a national agricultural policy framework that coordinates supply and demand through production and import control and pricing mechanisms designed to prevent shortages and surpluses, to ensure farmers a fair rate of return and Canadian consumer access to a high-quality, stable, and secure supply of these sensitive products. The milk supply management system is a &quot;federated provincial policy&quot; with four governing agencies, organizations and committees—Canadian Dairy Commission, Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee (CMSMC), regional milk pools, and provincial milk marketing boards. The dairy supply management system is administered by the federal government through the Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC), which was established in 1966 and is composed mostly of dairy farmers, administers the dairy supply management system for Canada&#x27;s 12,000 dairy farms. The federal government is involved in supply management through the CDC in the administration of imports and exports. The Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee (CMSMC) was introduced in 1970 as the body responsible for monitoring the production rates of milk and setting the national Market Sharing Quota (MSQ) for industrial raw milk. The supply management system was authorized in 1972 through the Farm Products Agencies Act. Supply management ensures consistent pricing of milk for farmers with no fluctuation in the market. The prices are based on the demand for milk throughout the country and how much is being produced. In order to start a new farm or increase production more share into the SMS needs to be bought into known as &quot;Quota&quot;. in this case farmers must remain up to or below the amount of &quot;quota&quot; they have bought share of. Each province in Canada has their own cap on quota based on the demand in the market. There is a cap on the countries quota known as total quota per month. In 2016 the total butter fat produced per month was 28,395,848 kg.

=== World Milk Production ===

===United States===

In the United States, the top five dairy states are, in order by total milk production; California, Wisconsin, New York, Idaho, and Texas. Dairy farming is also an important industry in Florida, Minnesota, Ohio and Vermont. There are 40,000 dairy farms in the United States.

Pennsylvania has 8,500 farms with 555,000 dairy cows. Milk produced in Pennsylvania yields an annual revenue of about US$1.5 billion.

Milk prices collapsed in 2009. Senator Bernie Sanders accused Dean Foods of controlling 40% of the country&#x27;s milk market. He has requested the United States Department of Justice to pursue an anti-trust investigation. Dean Foods says it buys 15% of the country&#x27;s raw milk. In 2011, a federal judge approved a settlement of $30 million to 9,000 farmers in the Northeast.

Herd size in the US varies between 1,200 on the West Coast and Southwest, where large farms are commonplace, to roughly 50 in the Midwest and Northeast, where land-base is a significant limiting factor to herd size. The average herd size in the U.S. is about one hundred cows per farm but the midpoint size is 900 cows with 49% of all cows residing on farms of 1000 or more cows.

<text>Cedar Lake is a lake just north of Lake Winnipegosis in Manitoba, Canada. Cedar Lake&#x27;s water level is controlled by the Grand Rapids Dam. The town of Grand Rapids and the First Nations town of Easterville are nearby.

The lake is known to have excellent examples of prehistoric amber fossil of cretaceous age. This type of amber is called as &quot;Chemawinit&quot;, according to an Indian tribe which lives in this area. Another name of this amber is &quot;Cedarit&quot;. This amber contains many organic inclusions. To date, these inclusions have not been thoroughly researched.

The lake&#x27;s main source is the Saskatchewan River, which forms a delta on the northwest side of the lake. The flow of the Saskatchewan River to Lake Winnipeg on the eastern end of Cedar Lake is regulated by the Grand Rapids Dam built in 1962 by Manitoba Hydro.

<text>A triskelion or triskeles is an ancient motif consisting either of a triple spiral exhibiting rotational symmetry or of other patterns in triplicate that emanate from a common center.
The spiral design can be based on interlocking Archimedean spirals, or represent three bent human limbs. It occurs in artifacts of the European Neolithic and Bronze Ages with continuation into the Iron Age – especially in the context of the La Tène culture and of related Celtic traditions.
The actual &quot;triskeles&quot; symbol of three human legs is found especially in Greek antiquity, beginning in archaic pottery and continued in coinage of the classical period.

In the Hellenistic period, the symbol became associated with the island of Sicily, appearing on coins minted under Dionysius I of Syracuse beginning in BCE.
It later appears in heraldry, and, other than in the flag of Sicily, came into use in the arms and flags of the Isle of Man (known in Manx as ).

Greek () means from (), and (), .
While the Greek adjective ( of a table) is ancient, use of the term for the symbol is modern, introduced in 1835 by Honoré Théodoric d&#x27;Albert de Luynes as French , and adopted in the spelling &quot;triskeles&quot; following Otto Olshausen (1886).
The form &quot;triskelion&quot; (as it were Greek ) is a diminutive which entered English usage in numismatics in the late-19th century.
The form consisting of three human legs (as opposed to the triple spiral) has also been called a &quot;triquetra of legs&quot;, also &quot;triskelos&quot; or &quot;triskel&quot;.

==Use in European antiquity==

===Neolithic to Iron Age===

The triple spiral symbol, or three-spiral volute, appears in many early cultures: the first appeared in Malta (4400–3600 BCE); the second in the astronomical calendar of the megalithic tomb of Newgrange in Ireland built around 3200 BCE; as well as on Mycenaean vessels. The Neolithic-era symbol of three conjoined spirals may have had triple significance similar to the imagery that lies behind the triskelion. It is carved into the rock of a stone lozenge near the main entrance of the prehistoric Newgrange monument in now County Meath, Ireland. It also appears on a 1st-century BCE dolmen tomb in Rathkenny, County Meath.

There is also an example of a &quot;triskele&quot; on a stone fragment discovered in Gloucestershire that, as of 2023, is held by the British Museum and thought to date from between the Neolithic period and Bronze Age.

The triskelion was a motif in the art of the Iron Age Celtic La Tène culture.

===Classical Antiquity===

The &quot;triskeles&quot; proper, composed of three human legs, is younger than the triple spiral found in decorations on Greek pottery
especially as a design shown on Hoplite shields and later Greek and Anatolian coinage.
An early example is found on the Shield of Achilles in an Attic &quot;hydria&quot; of the late 6th century BCE.
It is found on coinage in Lycia and on staters of Pamphylia (at Aspendos in 370–333 BCE) and Pisidia. The meaning of the Greek &quot;triskeles&quot; is not recorded directly.
The Duc de Luynes, in his 1835 study, noted the co-occurrence of the symbol with the eagle, the cockerel, the head of Medusa, Perseus, three crescent moons, three ears of corn, and three grains of corn.
From this, he reconstructed a feminine divine triad that he identified with the triple goddess Hecate.
The &quot;triskeles&quot; was adopted as emblem by the rulers of Syracuse. It is possible that this usage is related with the Greek name of the island of Sicily, () .
The Sicilian &quot;triskeles&quot; is shown with the head of Medusa at the center.
The ancient symbol has been re-introduced in modern flags of Sicily since 1848. The oldest find of a &quot;triskeles&quot; in Sicily is a vase dated to the late 7th century BCE of which researchers speculated a Minoan-Mycenaean origin (and for which no proof has been given).

===Roman period and Late Antiquity===
Late examples of the triple spiral symbols are found in Iron Age Europe, carved in rock in Castro Culture settlements in Galicia, Asturias, and Northern Portugal.
The symbol took on new meaning to Irish Celtic Christians before the 5th century CE as a symbol of the Trinity.

==Medieval use==
The triple spiral design is found as a decorative element in Gothic architecture. The three legs (triskeles) symbol is rarely found as a charge in late medieval heraldry, notably as the arms of the King of Mann (Armorial Wijnbergen, ), and as canting arms in the city seal of the Bavarian city of Füssen (dated 1317).

==Modern usage==
Polish town of Dukla has used three hunting bugles arranged in triskelion shape as their symbol since XVI century.

The triskeles was included in the design of the Army Gold Medal awarded to British Army majors and above who had taken a key part in the Battle of Maida (1806).
An early flag of Sicily, proposed in 1848, included the Sicilian triskeles or &quot;Trinacria symbol&quot;.
Later versions of Sicilian flags have retained the emblem, including the one officially adopted in 2000.
The Flag of the Isle of Man (1932) shows a heraldic design of a triskeles of three armoured legs.

In the Bavarian town of Füssen, Germany the flag and coat of arms of the town contains a triskele, as does the flag of the Russian autonomous region of Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug.

In Ireland, the triskelion is displayed in hospitals and care centres to indicate that a patient is dying or has died. It is based on the historical use of the triskele in Celtic Ireland and it is used as an alternative to religious imagery. In this context, the three spirals represent the cycle of birth, life and death.

The spiral is used by some polytheistic reconstructionist or neopagan groups. As a &quot;Celtic symbol&quot;, it is used primarily by groups with a Celtic cultural orientation and, less frequently, can also be found in use by various eclectic or syncretic traditions such as Neopaganism. The spiral triskele is one of the primary symbols of Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism, used to represent a variety of triplicities in cosmology and theology; it is also a favored symbol due to its association with the god Manannán mac Lir.

Other uses of triskelion-like emblems include the logo for the Trisquel Linux distribution and the seal of the United States Department of Transportation.

In the 1960s television programme Star Trek, members of the crew are forced to fight to the death on a triskelion playing surface in the episode The Gamesters of Triskelion.

A specific version of the triskele comprising three sevens has been adopted by neo-nazis. In South Africa the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), an Afrikaner nationalist, neo-Nazi organization and political party (founded 1973), uses it as its symbol in place of a swastika. The Blood &amp; Honour neo-Nazi group also uses it. The 27th SS Volunteer Division Langemarck&#x27;s shoulder strap cipher was a triskele (though not involving sevens). Use of the triskele can be a prosecutable offence under German law, depending on the context in which it is used.

Stylised versions of the Triskelion are commonly used as a symbol for BDSM.

==Occurrence in nature==
The boric acid and triethylborane molecules are triskelion-shaped as seen in the images. The molecular point group of triskelion-shaped molecules is &quot;C&quot;3h. The endocytic protein, clathrin, is triskelion-shaped, as well as the Ediacaran organism Tribrachidium.

<text>Air travel is a form of travel in vehicles such as airplanes, jet aircraft, helicopters, hot air balloons, blimps, gliders, hang gliders, parachutes, or anything else that can sustain flight. Use of air travel began vastly increasing in the 1930s: the number of Americans flying went from about 6,000 in 1930 to 450,000 by 1934 and to 1.2 million by 1938. It has continued to greatly increase in recent decades, doubling worldwide between the mid-1980s and the year 2000. Modern air travel is much safer than road travel.

==Domestic and international flights==
Air travel are separated into two general classifications: national/domestic and international flights. Flights from one point to another within the same country are domestic flights. Flights from a point in one country to a point within a different country are international flights. Travelers can use domestic or international flights in either private or public travel.

While domestic flights typically operate on a more straightforward process with fewer security and immigration checks, international flights require passports, visas (in some cases), and customs clearance. Airlines, regulations, and travel requirements may vary significantly between domestic and international routes, making it important for travelers to check policies before flying.

==Commercial air travel==
Travel class on an airplane is usually split into a two, three or four class model service. U.S. domestic flights usually have two classes: economy class and a domestic first class partitioned into cabins. International flights may have up to four classes: economy class; premium economy; business class or club class; and first class.

Most air travel starts and ends at a commercial airport. The typical procedure is check-in; border control; airport security baggage and passenger check before entering the gate; boarding; flying; and pick-up of luggage and – limited to international flights – another border control at the host country&#x27;s border. Most passengers must go through these steps when flying with a commercial airline. 

For longer journeys, air travel may consist of several flights with a layover in between. The number of layovers often depends on the number of hub airports the journey is routed through.

Airlines rely either on the point-to-point model or the spoke-and-hub model to operate flights in between airports. The point-to-point model, often used by low-cost carriers such as Southwest, relies on scheduling flights directly between destination airports. The spoke-and-hub model, used by carriers such as American and Delta, relies on scheduling flights to and from hub airports. The hub-and-spoke model allows airlines to connect more destinations and provide more frequent routes, while the point-to-point system allows airlines to avoid layovers and have more cost effective operations.

==Environmental effects==
Modern aircraft consume less fuel per person and mile traveled than cars when fully booked. 
However, the distances traveled are often significantly larger and will not replace car travel but instead add to it, and not every flight is booked out. 

Instead, the scheduled flights are predominant, resulting in a far worse fuel efficiency.
According to the ATAG, flights produced of the greenhouse gas in 2015 globally, as compared to an estimated total of anthropogenic . Carbon offset is often proposed as solution to mitigate the emissions of flying. There are many NGOs that offer to compensate emissions by advancing clean renewable energy, reducing energy consumption and capturing already released carbon in trees or other plants. However, carbon offsetting is a very controversial topic as it only tries to mitigate what has already been emitted.

== Safety ==

Modern air travel is significantly safer than road travel. In 2008 in the United States, there were 1.27 fatalities per 100 million road vehicle miles, compared to no fatalities and almost zero accidents per million flying miles. There were more than five million driving accidents, compared to 20 accidents in flying. Travelers may perceive planes to be more dangerous as they do not allow individual control and because plane crashes are more catastrophic events (the availability bias).

==Health effects==

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the third-most common vascular disease, next to stroke and heart attack. It is estimated that DVT affects one in 5,000 travelers on long flights. Risk increases with exposure to more flights within a short time frame and with increasing duration of flights.

During flight, the aircraft cabin pressure is usually maintained at the equivalent of above sea level. Most healthy travelers will not notice any effects. However, for travelers with cardiopulmonary diseases (especially those who normally require supplemental oxygen), cerebrovascular disease, anemia, or sickle cell disease, conditions in an aircraft can exacerbate underlying medical conditions. Aircraft cabin air is typically dry, usually 10%–20% humidity, which can cause dryness of the mucous membranes of the eyes and airways.

<doc id="449955" wikidata="Q41378" url="?curid=449955" title="Charles Stark Draper">
<text>Charles Stark &quot;Doc&quot; Draper (October 2, 1901 – July 25, 1987) was an American scientist and engineer, known as the &quot;father of inertial navigation&quot;. He was the founder and director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s Instrumentation Laboratory, which was later spun out of MIT to become the non-profit Charles Stark Draper Laboratory. 

Beginning in the 1940s, Draper developed inertial guidance systems for aircraft. In World War II, Draper invented the first lead-computing gunsights for aircraft, and later applying similar technology to missile guidance systems. In 1954, Draper&#x27;s application of inertial controls to computerized autopilot allowed the Instrumentation Lab to conduct the first coast-to-coast unmanned flight. The lab also made the Apollo Moon landings possible through the Apollo Guidance Computer it designed for NASA. In 1960, Draper was one of the scientists recognized as &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Men of the Year.

==Early life and education==
Draper was born in Windsor, Missouri. He attended the University of Missouri in 1917, then transferred to Stanford University, California in 1919, from which he earned a B.A. in psychology in 1922. He matriculated at MIT in 1922, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in electrochemical engineering (1926), and Master of Science (1928), and a Doctor of Science (1938) degrees in physics. Charles Stark Draper&#x27;s relatives were prominent in his home state of Missouri, including his cousin, Governor Lloyd C. Stark.

==Career==
Draper began teaching at MIT as an assistant professor. He was appointed a full professor in aeronautical engineering in 1939. It was here that he founded the Instrumentation Laboratory in the 1930s, spun off in 1973 as the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory.

Draper&#x27;s interest in flight instrumentation was influenced by becoming a pilot in the 1930s: although he failed to become an Air Corps pilot, he learned to fly by enrolling in a civilian course. Draper was one of the pioneers of inertial navigation, a technology used in aircraft, space vehicles, and submarines that enables such vehicles to navigate by sensing changes in direction and speed using gyroscopes and accelerometers. A pioneering figure in aerospace engineering, he contributed to the Apollo space program with his knowledge of guidance systems.

In 1961 Draper and the Instrumentation Lab were awarded the first contract given out for the Apollo program to send humans to the Moon, which was announced by President John F. Kennedy on 25 May of that year. This led to the creation of the Apollo Guidance Computer, a one-cubic-foot computer that controlled the navigation and guidance of the lunar module to the Moon on nine launches, six of which landed on the Moon&#x27;s surface.

Draper taught and conducted research at MIT until January 1970, devoting most of his energy during his final decade to completing the Apollo computers and software.

Draper was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1981 for his multiple inventions and scientific contributions.

==Professional associations==
Draper was a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering of the National Academy of Sciences as well as the French Academy of Sciences. He had served as president of the International Academy of Astronautics, and was a member of the American Physical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

==Awards==
Draper received more than 70 honors and awards, including the Howard N. Potts Medal in 1960, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1961, the National Medal of Science from President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, the ASME&#x27;s Rufus Oldenburger Medal in 1971, the Robert H. Goddard Trophy in 1978, the AACC&#x27;s Richard E. Bellman Control Heritage Award and the Smithsonian&#x27;s Langley Gold Medal in 1981, and the National Academy of Engineering&#x27;s Founders Award. His renown was international, and was recognized by many foreign countries, including France, United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union.

Draper was inducted as a member of the inaugural class to the International Space Hall of Fame.

Draper was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1981.

==Legacy==
He died in the Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at age 85. He was eulogized as &quot;one of the foremost engineers of our time&quot;, and Howard Wesley Johnson, Chairman of the MIT Corporation, credited him for creating a &quot;whole new industry in inertial instruments and systems for airplanes, ships, submarines, missiles, satellites and space vehicles&quot;.

===Charles Stark Draper Prize===
The National Academy of Engineering established the Charles Stark Draper Prize in 1988 on behalf of the namesake&#x27;s laboratory at MIT. The prize, which is awarded annually and consists of $500,000 in cash, a gold medallion, and a hand-inscribed certificate, aims to &quot;increase public understanding of the contributions of engineering and technology to the welfare and freedom of humanity&quot;. Endowment for the prize was provided by the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory.

<text>The Daily Illini, commonly known as the DI, is a student-run newspaper that has been published for the community of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign since 1871. Weekday circulation during fall and spring semesters is 7,000; copies are distributed free at more than 100 locations throughout Champaign–Urbana.

The paper is published by Illini Media Company (IMC), a not-for-profit corporation which owns several other student-run media outlets, and also operates WPGU 107.1 FM, a student-run commercial radio station. While the IMC has no official ties to the university, university professors and others in the academic community serve on its board of directors. The newspaper’s staff has both full-time professionals and students.

The paper is published daily online and once a month in print as a magazine-style newspaper.

== History ==

=== The Student ===
The Daily Illini was preceded by The Student, published as a monthly, beginning with its first issue in November 1871 and concluding with its last issue in December 1873. The first issue of The Student from November 1871 states that the publication was edited by members of the senior class of the Illinois Industrial University, as the University of Illinois was called at the time. In the Salutatory of the first issue, the editors plead with readers to read with a “charitable eye” in regard to any shortcomings of their early issues, such as “inaccuracy” and “dullness”, as well as its visual appearance on account of their inexperience and the desire to improve future issues. Topics covered in the first issue of The Student include Edgar Allan Poe, the study of language, a specific type of caterpillar, color blindness, the training of animals for exhibition purposes, American politics and architecture, as well as other topics in science. Also published in the first issue, an Illinois Central Railroad time table, well wishes for a newly married couple, a plea to readers to financially support the paper, its advertising rates, with one column costing $40 for one year, a list of departments of study at the university, including Mining Engineering, requirements for admission, stating that students must be at least 15 years of age, and various advertisements, including one for a “Manufacturer of Saddles and Harness” in Champaign.

The final issue of The Student was published in December 1873 and was the twenty-third issue of the paper, with more stylization and formatting than its first issue. Topics covered in the final issue of The Student include war and a summary of a university board meeting. The final issue of The Student also mentions uncertainty of the future of the newspaper, citing the potential for it to be run by representatives of the entirety of the student body of the Illinois Industrial University, also referencing a meeting of the General Assembly of Students at which a resolution was passed for The Senate to take over “management and publication of The Student”. A committee was subsequently established to handle the paper and its transition.

=== The Illini ===
In January 1874, the month immediately following the final issue of The Student, the first issue of The Illini was published. In its prospectus, the first issue of The Illini references The Student and a desire to uphold its “former interest as a lively, cheerful, home journal”. The prospectus also states the goal of The Illini as being to “fairly represent the University” as well as “the state and progress of literature, science and human industry elsewhere”. In contrast to The Student, The Illini was to be led by a university faculty committee and students originating from different departments within the university. In an editorial in the same first issue of The Illini, “wishing to make it more worthy the institution which fosters it, we transfer it to the student&#x27;s Senate of the University, believing that the Faculty and students from being more intimately connected with it, will labor more earnestly for its success”. Topics covered in the first issue of The Illini include The Bau-Akademie, an architecture school in Berlin, Germany, the classification of animals in terms of the work of the late Professor Louis Agassiz, statements made at a dedication ceremony for the campuses Adelphic Society, an account of a writer’s dream in which they wished for Ancient History exam answers instead of studying, Natural History, the time the university ran on, and a campus forest tree plantation handled by the Department of Horticulture.

=== The Daily Illini ===
The last issue titled The Illini was published In June 1907 and was at this point published daily, except for on Mondays. The following issue, published in September 1907, resuming after publication ended for the summer, was the first to be titled The Daily Illini, without mention of the change in either the June 1907 issue or September 1907 issue. Despite the title change coming in September 1907, The Illini had begun daily publication five years prior, in September 1902. By 1975, The Daily Illini was published daily, except Sunday and Monday during the academic year and daily except Sunday, Monday, and Saturday during the summer.

==Staff==

The editorial, business and production departments are staffed by students who are enrolled in a wide variety of degree programs, not just journalism. Several full-time professionals, including the newspaper’s publisher and the advertising and circulation managers, are employees of IMC. Some students are paid for their jobs in reporting, editing, production and advertising, but some of the students work for free, as well.

The &quot;Daily Illini&quot; staff completely changes once per year, known as &quot;turnover&quot; in the DI offices. &quot;Turnover&quot; means the current group of editors (editor-in-chief, news editors, sports editors, opinions editors and features editors, among others) finish their tenure at the &quot;DI&quot; in their current editing position, and a new group of editors fills these positions. The new editor-in-chief is chosen by some members of the IMC, and then the editor-in-chief chooses all of the other editors that will work under him/her.

At the beginning of each fall and spring semester, the &quot;DI&quot; hires new reporters and staff members. All University of Illinois students, regardless of major, are encouraged to apply.

==Offices==
The newspaper’s office is located at 1001 S. Wright St. in Champaign.

In May 2006, the newspaper along with the other IMC entities, moved east to a new building at 512 E. Green St. in Champaign, closer to campus. In doing so, the company consolidated the offices of WPGU, which had been in a separate location, with the offices of the rest of the IMC entities.

In May 2018, Illini Media moved from its Green Street location to the University YMCA.

==Prominent staff emeriti==
Notable alumni of the newspaper include author and famed New Yorker editor William Maxwell, novelist Nelson Algren, ABC News political director Hal Bruno, &quot;Rape of Nanking&quot; author Iris Chang, &quot;Simpsons&quot; producer/writer Larry Doyle, film critic Roger Ebert, novelist Dave Eggers, folk singer Dan Fogelberg, &quot;High Times&quot; editor Steven Hager, Playboy founder/CEO Hugh Hefner, attorney Albert E. Jenner Jr., columnist Robert Novak, &quot;Coast to Coast Live&quot; radio host Ian Punnett, advice columnist Dan Savage, film critic Gene Shalit, author Dave Cullen, and several Pulitzer Prize winners.

==Controversies==
===Anti-semitism===
In January 2003, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily Illini&quot; printed a letter in its opinion section titled &quot;Jews Manipulate America.&quot;
A large amount of criticism followed soon after, calling into question the paper&#x27;s editorial policy. The editors responded by defending their right to publish it. Critics noted that the publishing of this letter was not surprising to them after &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily Illini&quot;″s history of publishing other articles that appeared to be anti-Semitic. Previous letters published in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily Illini&quot; have accused Israel of being guilty of genocide and another compared the Jews to Nazis. Moreover, while &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily Illini&quot; apologized when it published a photo thought to be demeaning to black students, it refused to apologize for publishing a letter claiming that Jews manipulate America.

In December 2003, the paper published an article by Miriam Sobh called &quot;Stop Turning a Blind Eye&quot; that contained a quote attributed to Ariel Sharon that was fabricated. (See Alleged Ouze Merham interview of Ariel Sharon.) The author later gave a full apology for using the fabricated quote. Despite the controversy that occurred from printing the falsely attributed quote the first time, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily Illini&quot; printed it a second time on November 19, 2004, in another article.

The &quot;DI&quot; also published an anti-semitic comic strip on November 5, 2004, strip of &quot;I Hate Pam&quot;. The paper acknowledged in a later editorial that the strip mocked Jews. The comic was suspended for approximately four weeks.

===&quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; participation===
The newspaper&#x27;s former editor-in-chief Acton Gorton and opinions editor Chuck Prochaska made a controversial decision in February 2006 to print the cartoons from the &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons controversy that had previously been printed in Europe and had led to protests around the world and a few instances of violent rioting by offended Muslims. Gorton&#x27;s column that accompanied the cartoons was cited to support the first view. Prochaska and Gorton were also criticized by fellow editors in a later editorial for not following protocol in previously discussing their printing, though it was revealed later that some of the staff did know about it in the hours prior to printing. A firestorm of letters and calls from all over the country and the world came into the &quot;Daily Illini&quot; expressing both support and outrage. Gorton and Prochaska were suspended with pay for two weeks to investigate whether proper procedures were followed. As of March 14, 2006, Gorton was terminated from the &quot;Daily Illini&quot;. Prochaska was offered the opportunity to return to his position but refused.

===Editorial accuracy===
The &quot;Daily Illini&quot; editorials were halted on September 22, 2006, after the September 20, 2006 editorial on the Midnight Madness basketball event was found to contain misinformation and misinterpretation. The paper resumed publishing editorials on October 9, 2006 with an editorial explaining the changes to the way editorials will be researched and published. However, even with the new guidelines, on November 29, 2006, the newspaper printed an editorial calling Representative Charles B. Rangel a Republican when describing his draft bill. Rangel is a Democrat.

===Salary Guide publication===
On March 9, 2010 &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily Illini&quot; published a guide to salaries on the Urbana–Champaign campus of the University of Illinois. The information was received through an Illinois Freedom of Information Act request. The online database receives the highest traffic on the site since they started tracking online traffic.

==2012 financial crisis==
In February 2012, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily Illini&quot; enlisted the help of University of Illinois alumnus and film critic Roger Ebert to raise funds for the newspaper. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily Illini&quot; owed nearly $250,000 loan on their building. The twelve-page broadsheet, which is very costly, played a part in the struggling company. As the paper is funded and published by the Illini Media Company, it receives money from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign via mandatory student fees. These fees were approved by the University Board of Trustees.

<doc id="449958" wikidata="Q157651" url="?curid=449958" title="Gustáv Husák">
<text>Gustáv Husák ( , ; ; 10 January 1913 – 18 November 1991) was a Czechoslovak politician who served as the long-time First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia from 1969 to 1987 and the President of Czechoslovakia from 1975 to 1989. 

His rule is known for the period of normalization after the 1968 Prague Spring.

== Early life ==
Gustáv Husák was born to an unemployed worker in Pozsonyhidegkút, Kingdom of Hungary, Austria-Hungary (now Bratislava-Dúbravka, Slovakia). He joined the Communist Youth Union at the age of sixteen while studying at the grammar school in Bratislava.

In 1933, when he started his studies at the law faculty of the Comenius University in Bratislava, he joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) which was banned from 1938 to 1945. During World War II, he was periodically jailed by the Jozef Tiso government for illegal Communist activities. He was one of the leaders of the 1944 Slovak National Uprising against Nazi Germany and Tiso. Husák was a member of the Presidium of the Slovak National Council from 1 to 5 September 1944.

After the war, he began a career as a government official in Slovakia and party functionary in Czechoslovakia. From 1946 to 1950, he was the head of the devolved administration of Slovakia, and as such strongly contributed to the liquidation of the anti-communist Christian democratic Democratic Party of Slovakia. The Democratic Party of Slovakia established in 1944 had taken 62% in the 1946 elections in Slovakia (whereas in the Czech part of the republic of then-Czechoslovakia, the clear winners were the Communists), thus complicating the Communist ambitions for a swift taking of power. Husák&#x27;s loyalty to the central organs of the Czechoslovak Communist party as well as his considerable talent for body politics and a ruthless approach to political opponents contributed largely to the crushing of the Democratic Party&#x27;s dissent in Slovakia and releasing the popular opinion in the country to the whims of prevailing political currents.

In 1950, he fell victim to a Stalinist purge of the party leadership, and was sentenced to life imprisonment, spending the years from 1954 to 1960 in the Leopoldov Prison. A convinced Communist, he always viewed his imprisonment as a gross misunderstanding, which he periodically stressed in several letters of appeal addressed to the party leadership. It is generally acknowledged that the then party leader and president Antonín Novotný repeatedly declined to pardon Husák, assuring his comrades that &quot;you do not know what he is capable of if he comes to power&quot;.

As part of the De-Stalinization period in Czechoslovakia, Husák&#x27;s conviction was overturned and his party membership restored in 1963. By 1967, he had become a critic of Novotný and the KSČ&#x27;s neo-Stalinist leadership. In April 1968, during the Prague Spring under new party leader and fellow Slovak Alexander Dubček, Husák became a vice-premier of Czechoslovakia, responsible for overseeing reforms in Slovakia.

== Leader of Czechoslovakia ==
As the Soviet Union grew increasingly alarmed by Dubček&#x27;s liberal reforms in 1968 (Prague Spring), Husák, originally Dubček&#x27;s ally and a moderate supporter of the reform programme, began calling for caution.

After the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia in August, Husák participated in the Czechoslovak-Soviet negotiations between the kidnapped Dubček and Leonid Brezhnev in Moscow. Husák changed course and became a leader among those party members calling for the reversal of Dubček&#x27;s reforms. An account for his pragmatism was given in one of his official speeches in Slovakia after the 1968 events, during which he ventured a rhetorical question, asking where the opponents of the Soviet Union wished to find allies of Czechoslovakia that might come to support the country against Soviet troops.

Supported by Moscow, he was appointed leader of the Communist Party of Slovakia in as early as August 1968, and he succeeded Dubček as first secretary (title changed to general secretary in 1971) of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in April 1969. He reversed Dubček&#x27;s reforms and purged the party of its liberal members in 1969–1971. In 1975, Husák was elected President of Czechoslovakia. During the two decades of Husák&#x27;s leadership, Czechoslovakia became one of Moscow&#x27;s most loyal allies.

In the first years following the invasion, Husák managed to appease the outraged civil population by providing a relatively satisfactory living standard and avoiding any overt reprisals like was the case in the 1950s. His regime was not a complete return to the heavy-handed Stalinism that had prevailed during the first 20 years of Communist rule in the country. At the same time, the people&#x27;s rights were somewhat more restricted than was the case in János Kádár&#x27;s Hungary and Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Yugoslavia. Indeed, on the cultural level, the level of repression approached that seen in Erich Honecker&#x27;s East Germany and even Nicolae Ceauşescu&#x27;s Romania. There was a campaign of repression by the secret police (StB) targeting dissidents represented later by Charter 77 as well as hundreds of unknown individuals who happened to be targets of the StB&#x27;s pre-emptive strikes. The repression intensified over the years as Husák grew more conservative.

Starting in the early 1970s, Husák allowed those who had been purged in the aftermath of Prague Spring to rejoin the party. However, they were required to publicly distance themselves from their past support for reform.

The latter part of Husák&#x27;s tenure saw a struggle within the Politburo over whether to adopt Gorbachev-style reforms. While the hardliners, led by Vasiľ Biľak, were vehemently opposed to glasnost and perestroika, moderates led by Prime Minister Lubomir Strougal strongly favoured reform. Husák himself stayed neutral until April 1987, when he announced a somewhat half-hearted reform program scheduled to start in 1991.

Later that year, however, Husák yielded his post as general secretary to Miloš Jakeš in response to a desire for younger leaders (Jakeš and Ladislav Adamec) to share in power.

On 24 November 1989, the entire Presidum of the Communist Party, including Husák, resigned in the wake of the Velvet Revolution. The party officially abandoned power four days later, when the legislature deleted the portions of the Constitution that codified the party&#x27;s &quot;leading role.&quot; On 10 December, Husák swore in a new government. Although it was headed by communist Marián Čalfa, it had a non-communist majority—the first in 41 years that was not dominated by communists and/or fellow travelers. He resigned later that day, just hours after presiding over the formal end of the regime he had largely created. In an attempt to rehabilitate its image ahead of the first free elections in 44 years, the Communist Party expelled him in February 1990. 

He died on 18 November 1991, at the age of 78, and was buried at the Dúbravka cemetery.

== Legacy ==
There is still some question about Husák&#x27;s moral culpability for the last two decades of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia. After its collapse, Husák kept saying that he was just trying to diminish the aftermath of the Soviet invasion and had to constantly resist pressure from hard line Stalinists in the party such as Biľak, Alois Indra and the like. In the early 1970s, he personally pushed for an early withdrawal of the Soviet troops from Czechoslovak territory, which did not happen until 1991; this may be ascribed to his pragmatic attempts to ease the situation and to give an impression that things were leaning toward &quot;normality&quot;.

However, there are many ways in which he personally contributed to the Communist government&#x27;s longevity and policies. As the General Secretary of the Party, he was the nominal leader of the repressive state apparatus. There are many documented cases of appeals from politically persecuted persons, but almost none of them was given Husák&#x27;s attention. As the overall decay of Czechoslovak society was becoming more and more obvious in the 1980s, Husák became a politically impotent puppet of events.

Gustáv Husák was awarded the title Hero of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic three times, in 1969, 1973, and 1982. In 1983 he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.

Husák allegedly confessed to a Catholic priest before his death, having previously been an atheist. On his deathbed in 1991, Husák received the sacrament of reconciliation from a Catholic archbishop, Ján Sokol.

<text>Cedar Lake is a , residential lake, private community and unincorporated community located within Denville Township, Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The community&#x27;s governing body, the Cedar Lake Property Owners, has been maintaining its of land since June 2, 1925. 

==History==
Cedar Lake was originally a small, natural, spring-fed body of water. In its early days, the lake was used as an ice factory, where the frozen water was harvested and sold during the winters. The lake was dammed and its size was increased to improve the ice harvesting. In 1906, when it was still called Cranberry Lake or Silver Lake, it was purchased by M. W. Raynes and George B. Wright under their company Cedar Lake Park, Inc. The developers marketed their property as a summer resort and built cabins, lodges, and camps for its new residents. Many wealthy New Yorkers vacationed at the lake during weekends, including prominent figures such as Babe Ruth, who stayed in a house on the West Side of the lake. Cedar Lake Park, Inc. went bankrupt in 1924, and the Cedar Lake Property Owners (CLPO) was incorporated and eventually took over ownership of the lake, roads and certain lots from the prior owner. As transportation improved and major highways were built through Denville, houses were built on most of the lots surrounding the lake. Today, over 300 families live in the Cedar Lake Community.

==Recreation==
The lake is used for many recreational activities, including: swimming, fishing, ice skating, and non-motor boating. The lake has two sand beaches and a floating dock, and which are used by most members of the lake, especially throughout the summer months. The Cedar Lake Community Club (CLCC) runs a clubhouse available to all members of the lake, which provides a tennis court, basketball court, and a playground, organizes many community activities, and hosts a bar for the adults every Friday night.

Cedar Lake is a member of a local athletic organization called Hub Lakes, which includes other local communities: Lake Valhalla, Lake Arrowhead, Estling Lake, Indian Lake, Lake Intervale, Mountain Lakes, Lake Parsippany, Rainbow Lake, Rock Ridge, Lake Telemark, and White Meadow Lake. Hub Lakes provides competition between the lakes in bowling, diving, golf, horseshoes, roller hockey, softball, swimming, table tennis, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball.

<doc id="449962" wikidata="Q279486" url="?curid=449962" title="The Song of Hiawatha">
<text>The Song of Hiawatha is an 1855 epic poem in trochaic tetrameter by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow which features Native American characters. The epic relates the fictional adventures of an Ojibwe warrior named Hiawatha and the tragedy of his love for Minnehaha, a Dakota woman. Events in the story are set in the Pictured Rocks area of Michigan on the south shore of Lake Superior. Longfellow&#x27;s poem is based on oral traditions surrounding the figure of Manabozho, but it also contains his own innovations.

Longfellow drew some of his material from his friendship with Ojibwe chief Kahge-ga-gah-bowh (George Copway), who would visit Longfellow&#x27;s home. He also had frequent encounters with Black Hawk and other Sauk people on Boston Common, and he drew from &quot;Algic Researches&quot; (1839) and other writings by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, an ethnographer and United States Indian agent, and from &quot;Heckewelder&#x27;s Narratives&quot;. In sentiment, scope, overall conception, and many particulars, Longfellow insisted, &quot;I can give chapter and verse for these legends. Their chief value is that they are Indian legends.&quot;

Longfellow had originally planned on following Schoolcraft in calling his hero &quot;Manabozho,&quot; the name in use at the time among the Ojibwe of the south shore of Lake Superior for a figure of their folklore who was a trickster and transformer. But he wrote in his journal entry for June 28, 1854: &quot;Work at &#x27;Manabozho;&#x27; or, as I think I shall call it, &#x27;Hiawatha&#x27;—that being another name for the same personage.&quot; Longfellow was following Schoolcraft, but he was mistaken in thinking that the names were synonymous. The name Hiawatha is derived from a pre-colonial figure associated with the League of the Iroquois, then located in New York and Pennsylvania. The popularity of Longfellow&#x27;s poem nevertheless led to the name &quot;Hiawatha&quot; becoming associated with a number of locales and enterprises in the Great Lakes region.

==Publication and plot==

The poem was published on November 10, 1855, by Ticknor and Fields and was an immediate success. In 1857, Longfellow calculated that it had sold 50,000 copies.

Longfellow chose to set &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; at the Pictured Rocks, one of the locations along the south shore of Lake Superior favored by narrators of the Manabozho stories. The &quot;Song&quot; presents a legend of Hiawatha and his lover Minnehaha in 22 chapters (and an Introduction). Hiawatha is not introduced until Chapter III.

In Chapter I, Hiawatha&#x27;s arrival is prophesied by a &quot;mighty&quot; peace-bringing leader named Gitche Manito.

Chapter II tells a legend of how the warrior Mudjekeewis became Father of the Four Winds by slaying the Great Bear of the mountains, Mishe-Mokwa. His son Wabun, the East Wind, falls in love with a maiden whom he turns into the Morning Star, Wabun-Annung. Wabun&#x27;s brother, Kabibonokka, the North Wind, bringer of autumn and winter, attacks Shingebis, &quot;the diver&quot;. Shingebis repels him by burning firewood, and then in a wrestling match. A third brother, Shawondasee, the South Wind, falls in love with a dandelion, mistaking it for a golden-haired maiden.

In Chapter III, in &quot;unremembered ages&quot;, a woman named Nokomis falls from the Moon. Nokomis gives birth to Wenonah, who grows to be a beautiful young woman. Nokomis warns her not to be seduced by the West Wind (Mudjekeewis) but she does not heed her mother, becomes pregnant and bears Hiawatha.

In the ensuing chapters, Hiawatha has childhood adventures, falls in love with Minnehaha, slays the evil magician Pearl-Feather, invents written language, discovers corn and other episodes. Minnehaha dies in a severe winter.

The poem closes with the approach of a birch canoe to Hiawatha&#x27;s village, containing &quot;the Priest of Prayer, the Pale-face.&quot; Hiawatha welcomes him joyously; and the &quot;Black-Robe chief&quot; brings word of Jesus Christ and the Blessed Virgin. Hiawatha and the chiefs accept the Christian message. Hiawatha bids farewell to Nokomis, the warriors, and the young men, giving them this charge: &quot;But my guests I leave behind me/ Listen to their words of wisdom,/ Listen to the truth they tell you.&quot; Having endorsed the conversion of the Ojibwe people to the Roman Catholic Church, Hiawatha, similarly to Väinämöinen at the end of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, launches his canoe westward toward the sunset and departs forever.

==Folkloric and ethnographic critiques==
Longfellow used Henry Rowe Schoolcraft as a source of Native American legend. Schoolcraft seems to have been inconsistent in his pursuit of authenticity, as he rewrote and censored sources. The folklorist Stith Thompson, although crediting Schoolcraft&#x27;s research with being a &quot;landmark,&quot; was quite critical of him: &quot;Unfortunately, the scientific value of his work is marred by the manner in which he has reshaped the stories to fit his own literary taste.&quot; In addition to Longfellow&#x27;s own annotations, Stellanova Osborn (and previously F. Broilo in German) tracked down &quot;chapter and verse&quot; for every detail Longfellow took from Schoolcraft. Others have identified words from native languages included in the poem.

Intentionally epic in scope, &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; was described by its author as &quot;this Indian Edda&quot;. But Thompson judged that despite Longfellow&#x27;s claimed &quot;chapter and verse&quot; citations, the work &quot;produce[s] a unity the original will not warrant,&quot; i.e., it is non-Indian in its totality. Thompson found close parallels in plot between the poem and its sources, with the major exception that Longfellow took legends told about multiple characters and substituted the character Hiawatha as the protagonist of them all. Resemblances between the original stories, as &quot;reshaped by Schoolcraft,&quot; and the episodes in the poem are but superficial, and Longfellow omits important details essential to Ojibwe narrative construction, characterization, and theme. This is the case even with &quot;Hiawatha&#x27;s Fishing,&quot; the episode closest to its source. Some important parts of the poem were more or less Longfellow&#x27;s invention from fragments or his imagination. &quot;The courtship of Hiawatha and Minnehaha, the least &#x27;Indian&#x27; of any of the events in &quot;Hiawatha&quot;, has come for many readers to stand as the typical American Indian tale.&quot; Also, &quot;in exercising the function of selecting incidents to make an artistic production, Longfellow ... omitted all that aspect of the Manabozho saga which considers the culture hero as a trickster,&quot; this despite the fact that Schoolcraft had already diligently avoided what he himself called &quot;vulgarisms.&quot;

In his book on the development of the image of the Indian in American thought and literature, Roy Harvey Pearce wrote about &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;:

===Historical Iroquois Hiawatha===
Apparently, no connection, apart from name, exists between Longfellow&#x27;s hero and the sixteenth-century Iroquois chief Hiawatha who co-founded the Iroquois League. Longfellow took the name from works by Schoolcraft, whom he acknowledged as his main source. In his notes to the poem, Longfellow cites Schoolcraft:

a tradition prevalent among the North American Indians, of a personage of miraculous birth, who was sent among them to clear their rivers, forests, and fishing-grounds, and to teach them the arts of peace. He was known among different tribes by the several names of Michabou, Chiabo, Manabozo, Tarenyawagon, and Hiawatha.Longfellow&#x27;s notes make no reference to the Iroquois or the Iroquois League or to any historical personage.

However, according to ethnographer Horatio Hale (1817–1896), there was a longstanding confusion between the Iroquois leader Hiawatha and the Iroquois deity Aronhiawagon because of &quot;an accidental similarity in the Onondaga dialect between [their names].&quot; The deity, he says, was variously known as Aronhiawagon, Tearonhiaonagon, Taonhiawagi, or Tahiawagi; the historical Iroquois leader, as Hiawatha, Tayonwatha or Thannawege. Schoolcraft &quot;made confusion worse ... by transferring the hero to a distant region and identifying him with Manabozho, a fantastic divinity of the Ojibways. [Schoolcraft&#x27;s book] has not in it a single fact or fiction relating either to Hiawatha himself or to the Iroquois deity Aronhiawagon.&quot;

In 1856, Schoolcraft published &quot;The Myth of Hiawatha and Other Oral Legends Mythologic and Allegoric of the North American Indians,&quot; reprinting (with a few changes) stories previously published in his &quot;Algic Researches&quot; and other works. Schoolcraft dedicated the book to Longfellow, whose work he praised highly.

The U.S. Forest Service has said that both the historical and poetic figures are the sources of the name for the Hiawatha National Forest.

===Indian words recorded by Longfellow===
Longfellow cites the Indian words he used as from the works by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft. The majority of the words were Ojibwa, with a few from the Dakota, Cree and Onondaga languages.

Though the majority of the Native American words included in the text accurately reflect pronunciation and definitions, some words appear incomplete. For example, the Ojibway words for &quot;blueberry&quot; are (plural: ) for the berries and (plural: ) for the bush upon which the berries grow. Longfellow uses &quot;Meenah&#x27;ga,&quot; which appears to be a partial form for the bush, but he uses the word to mean the berry. Critics believe such mistakes are likely attributable to Schoolcraft (who was often careless about details) or to what always happens when someone who does not understand the nuances of a language and its grammar tries to use select words out of context.

===Inspiration from the Finnish &quot;Kalevala&quot;===
&quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; was written in trochaic tetrameter, the same meter as &quot;Kalevala&quot;, the Finnish epic compiled by Elias Lönnrot from fragments of folk poetry. Longfellow had learned some of the Finnish language while spending a summer in Sweden in 1835. It is likely that, 20 years later, Longfellow had forgotten most of what he had learned of that language, and he referred to a German translation of the &quot;Kalevala&quot; by Franz Anton Schiefner. Trochee is a rhythm natural to the Finnish language—inasmuch as Finnish words are normally accented on the first syllable—to the same extent that iamb is natural to English. Longfellow&#x27;s use of trochaic tetrameter for his poem has an artificiality that the &quot;Kalevala&quot; does not have in its own language.

He was not the first American poet to use the trochaic (or tetrameter) in writing Indian romances. Schoolcraft had written a romantic poem, &quot;Alhalla, or the Lord of Talladega&quot; (1843) in trochaic tetrameter, about which he commented in his preface: 
The meter is thought to be not ill adapted to the Indian mode of enunciation. Nothing is more characteristic of their harangues and public speeches, than the vehement yet broken and continued strain of utterance, which would be subject to the charge of monotony, were it not varied by the extraordinary compass in the stress of voice, broken by the repetition of high and low accent, and often terminated with an exclamatory vigor, which is sometimes startling. It is not the less in accordance with these traits that nearly every initial syllable of the measure chosen is under accent. This at least may be affirmed, that it imparts a movement to the narrative, which, at the same time that it obviates languor, favors that repetitious rhythm, or pseudo-parallelism, which so strongly marks their highly compound lexicography. Longfellow wrote to his friend Ferdinand Freiligrath (who had introduced him to in 1842) about the latter&#x27;s article, &quot;The Measure of Hiawatha&quot; in the prominent London magazine, &quot;Athenaeum&quot; (December 25, 1855): &quot;Your article ... needs only one paragraph more to make it complete, and that is the statement that parallelism belongs to Indian poetry as well to Finnish ... And this is my justification for adapting it in Hiawatha.&quot; Trochaic is not a correct descriptor for Ojibwe oratory, song, or storytelling, but Schoolcraft was writing long before the study of Native American linguistics had come of age. Parallelism is an important part of Ojibwe language artistry.

==Cultural response==
===Reception and influence===

In August 1855, &quot;The New York Times &quot; carried an item on &quot;Longfellow&#x27;s New Poem&quot;, quoting an article from another periodical which said that it &quot;is very original, and has the simplicity and charm of a Saga ... it is the very antipodes of Alfred Lord Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Maud,&quot; which is ... morbid, irreligious, and painful.&quot; In October of that year, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;Song of Hiawatha&quot; is nearly printed, and will soon appear.&quot;

By November its column, &quot;Gossip: What has been most Talked About during the Week&quot;, observed that &quot;The madness of the hour takes the metrical shape of trochees, everybody writes trochaics, talks trochaics, and think [sic] in trochees: ...

The &quot;New York Times&quot; review of &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; was scathing. The anonymous reviewer judged that the poem &quot;is entitled to commendation&quot; for &quot;embalming pleasantly enough the monstrous traditions of an uninteresting, and, one may almost say, a justly exterminated race. As a poem, it deserves no place&quot; because there &quot;is no romance about the Indian.&quot; He complains that Hiawatha&#x27;s deeds of magical strength pale by comparison to the feats of Hercules and to &quot;Finn Mac Cool, that big stupid Celtic mammoth.&quot; The reviewer writes that &quot;Grotesque, absurd, and savage as the groundwork is, Mr. Longfellow has woven over it a profuse wreath of his own poetic elegancies.&quot; But, he concludes, &quot;Hiawatha&quot; &quot;will never add to Mr. Longfellow&#x27;s reputation as a poet.&quot;

In reaction to what he viewed as &quot;spiteful and offensive&quot; attacks on the poem, critic John Neal in the &quot;State of Maine&quot; on November 27 of that year praised &quot;this strange, beautiful poem&quot; as &quot;a fountain overflowing night and day with natural rhythm.&quot; He argued that the poem was evidence that &quot;Longfellow&#x27;s music is getting to be his own—and there are those about him who will not allow others to misunderstand or misrepresent its character.&quot;

Thomas Conrad Porter, a professor at Franklin and Marshall College, believed that Longfellow had been inspired by more than the metrics of the &quot;Kalevala.&quot; He claimed &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; was &quot;Plagiarism&quot; in the &quot;Washington National Intelligencer&quot; of November 27, 1855. Longfellow wrote to his friend Charles Sumner a few days later: &quot;As to having &#x27;taken many of the most striking incidents of the Finnish Epic and transferred them to the American Indians&#x27;—it is absurd&quot;. Longfellow also insisted in his letter to Sumner: &quot;I know the Kalevala very well, and that some of its legends resemble the Indian stories preserved by Schoolcraft is very true. But the idea of making me responsible for that is too ludicrous.&quot; Later scholars continued to debate the extent to which &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; borrowed its themes, episodes, and outline from the &quot;Kalevala.&quot;

Despite the critics, the poem was immediately popular with readers and continued so for many decades. The Grolier Club named &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; the most influential book of 1855. Lydia Sigourney was inspired by the book to write a similar epic poem on Pocahontas, though she never completed it. English writer George Eliot called &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, along with Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s 1850 book &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, the &quot;two most indigenous and masterly productions in American literature&quot;.

In the early twentieth century, Longfellow&#x27;s tale was adapted into books for young readers. W. T. Stead&#x27;s Books for the Bairns series published &quot;The Story of Hiawatha, Re-Told in Prose&quot; by Queenie Scott-Hopper (1905). Prolific English illustrator Alice B. Woodward contributed to the 1930 publication of a prose version of &quot;The Story of Hiawatha&quot; by Florence Shaw. Allen Chaffee and Armstrong Sperry adapted the story for a Random House prose edition in 1951.

===Music===

Longfellow&#x27;s poem was taken as the first American epic to be composed of North American materials and free of European literary models. Earlier attempts to write a national epic, such as &quot;The Columbiad&quot; of Richard Snowden (1753–1825), ‘a poem on the American war’ published in 1795, or Joel Barlow&#x27;s &quot;Vision of Columbus&quot; (1787) (rewritten and entitled &quot;The Columbiad&quot; in 1807), were considered derivative. Longfellow provided something entirely new, a vision of the continent&#x27;s pre-European civilisation in a metre adapted from a Finnish, non-Indo-European source.

Soon after the poem&#x27;s publication, composers competed to set it to music. One of the first to tackle the poem was Emile Karst, whose cantata &quot;Hiawatha&quot; (1858) freely adapted and arranged texts of the poem. It was followed by Robert Stoepel&#x27;s &quot;Hiawatha: An Indian Symphony&quot;, a work in 14 movements that combined narration, solo arias, descriptive choruses and programmatic orchestral interludes. The composer consulted with Longfellow, who approved the work before its premiere in 1859, but despite early success it was soon forgotten. An equally ambitious project was the five-part instrumental symphony by Ellsworth Phelps in 1878.

American composer Bessie Marshall Whitely (1871–1944) composed an opera, &quot;Hiawatha&#x27;s Childhood&quot;, based on Longfellow&#x27;s poem.

The poem also influenced two composers of European origin who spent a few years in the US but did not choose to settle there. The first of these was Frederick Delius, who completed his tone poem &quot;Hiawatha&quot; in 1888 and inscribed on the title page the passage beginning &quot;Ye who love the haunts of Nature&quot; from near the start of the poem. The work was not performed at the time, and the mutilated score was not revised and recorded until 2009.

The other instance was the poem&#x27;s connection with Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s Symphony No. 9, &quot;From the New World&quot; (1893). In an article published in the &quot;New York Herald&quot; on December 15, 1893, he said that the second movement of his work was a &quot;sketch or study for a later work, either a cantata or opera ... which will be based upon Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;Hiawatha&quot;&quot; (with which he was familiar in Czech translation), and that the third movement scherzo was &quot;suggested by the scene at the feast in Hiawatha where the Indians dance&quot;. African-American melodies also appeared in the symphony, thanks to his student Harry Burleigh, who used to sing him songs from the plantations which Dvořák noted down. The fact that Burleigh&#x27;s grandmother was part Indian has been suggested to explain why Dvořák came to equate Indian with African American music in his pronouncements to the press.

Among later orchestral treatments of the Hiawatha theme by American composers there was Louis Coerne&#x27;s four-part symphonic suite, each section of which was prefaced by a quotation from the poem. This had a Munich premiere in 1893 and a Boston performance in 1894. Dvořák&#x27;s student Rubin Goldmark followed with a &quot;Hiawatha Overture&quot; in 1896 and in 1901 there were performances of Hugo Kaun&#x27;s symphonic poems &quot;Minnehaha&quot; and &quot;Hiawatha&quot;. There were also additional settings of Longfellow&#x27;s words. Arthur Foote&#x27;s &quot;The Farewell of Hiawatha&quot; (Op. 11, 1886) was dedicated to the Apollo Club of Boston, the male voice group that gave its first performance. In 1897 Frederick Russell Burton (1861–1909) completed his dramatic cantata &quot;Hiawatha&quot;. At the same time he wrote &quot;Hiawatha&#x27;s Death Song&quot;, subtitled &#x27;Song of the Ojibways&#x27;, which set native words followed by an English translation by another writer.

Early 20th century British composer Hope Squire wrote several songs based on verses of &quot;Hiawatha&quot;. Much later, Mary Montgomery Koppel (born 1982) incorporated Ojibwe flute music for her setting of &quot;The Death of Minnehaha&quot; (2013) for two voices with piano and flute accompaniment.

The most celebrated setting of Longfellow&#x27;s story was the cantata trilogy, &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; (1898–1900), by the English composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The first part, &quot;Hiawatha&#x27;s Wedding Feast&quot; (Op. 30, No. 1), based on cantos 11–12 of the poem, was particularly famous for well over 50 years, receiving thousands of performances in the UK, the USA, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. Though it slipped from popularity in the late 20th century, revival performances continue. The initial work was followed by two additional oratorios which were equally popular: &quot;The Death of Minnehaha&quot; (Op. 30, No. 2), based on canto 20, and &quot;Hiawatha&#x27;s Departure&quot; (Op. 30, No. 4), based on cantos 21–2.

More popular settings of the poem followed publication of the poem. The first was Charles Crozat Converse&#x27;s &quot;The Death of Minnehaha&quot;, published in Boston around 1856. The hand-colored lithograph on the cover of the printed song, by John Henry Bufford, is now much sought after. The next popular tune, originally titled &quot;Hiawatha (A Summer Idyl)&quot;, was not inspired by the poem. It was composed by Charles Daniels (under the pseudonym Neil Moret) while on the train to Hiawatha, Kansas, in 1901 and was inspired by the rhythm of the wheels on the rails. It was already popular when James O&#x27;Dea added lyrics in 1903, and the music was newly subtitled &quot;His Song to Minnehaha&quot;. Later treated as a rag, it later became a jazz standard.

Duke Ellington incorporated treatments of Hiawatha and Minnehaha in his jazz suite &quot;The Beautiful Indians&quot; (1946–7). Other popular songs have included &quot;Hiawatha&#x27;s Melody of Love&quot;, by George W. Meyer, with words by Alfred Bryan and Artie Mehlinger (1908), and Al Bowlly&#x27;s &quot;Hiawatha&#x27;s Lullaby&quot; (1933).

Modern composers have written works with the Hiawatha theme for young performers. They include the English musician Stanley Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Hiawatha, 12 Scenes&quot; (1928) for first-grade solo piano, based on Longfellow&#x27;s lines, and Soon Hee Newbold&#x27;s rhythmic composition for strings in Dorian mode (2003), which is frequently performed by youth orchestras. The story of Hiawatha was dramatized by Tale Spinners for Children (UAC 11054) with Jordan Malek.

British rock band The Sweet reference Hiawatha and Minnehaha in their 1972 hit &quot;Wig-Wam Bam&quot;, written by Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn.

Some performers have incorporated excerpts from the poem into their musical work. Johnny Cash used a modified version of &quot;Hiawatha&#x27;s Vision“ as the opening piece on &quot;Johnny Cash Sings the Ballads of the True West&quot; (1965). Mike Oldfield used the sections &quot;Hiawatha&#x27;s Departure&quot; and &quot;The Son of the Evening Star&quot; in the second part of his &quot;Incantations&quot; album (1978), rearranging some words to conform more to his music. Laurie Anderson used parts of the poem&#x27;s third section at the beginning and end of the final piece of her &quot;Strange Angels&quot; album (1989).

===Artistic use===
Numerous artists responded to the epic. The earliest pieces of sculpture were by Edmonia Lewis, whose father was Haitian and her mother Native American and African American. &quot;The arrow-maker and his daughter&quot;, later called &quot;The Wooing of Hiawatha&quot;, was modeled in 1866 and carved in 1872. In 1872 Lewis carved &quot;The Marriage of Hiawatha&quot; in marble, a work purchased in 2010 by the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts. Lewis&#x27;s Hiawatha works remain notable not just because of her talented execution, but because of the rare insight within the pieces that comes from the artist being of Native American descent. Other 19th century sculptors inspired by the epic were Augustus Saint-Gaudens, whose marble statue of the seated Hiawatha (1874) is held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art; and Jacob Fjelde, who created a bronze statue, &quot;Hiawatha carrying Minnehaha&quot;, for the Columbian Exposition in 1893. It was installed in Minnehaha Park, Minneapolis, in 1912 (illustrated at the head of this article).

In the 20th century Marshall Fredericks created a small bronze Hiawatha (1938), now installed in the Michigan University Centre; a limestone statue (1949), also at the University of Michigan; and a relief installed at the Birmingham Covington School, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.

Early paintings were by artists who concentrated on authentic American Native subjects. Eastman Johnson&#x27;s pastel of Minnehaha seated by a stream (1857) was drawn directly from an Ojibwe model. The English artist Frances Anne Hopkins travelled in the hunting country of Canada and used her sketches from the trip when she returned to her studio in England in 1870. She painted her &quot;Minnehaha Feeding Birds&quot; about 1880. Critics have thought these two artists had a sentimental approach, as did Charles-Émile-Hippolyte Lecomte-Vernet (1821–1900) in his 1871 painting of Minnehaha, making her a native child of the wild. The kinship of the latter is with other kitsch images, such as Bufford&#x27;s cover for &quot;The Death of Minnehaha&quot; (see above) or those of the 1920s calendar painters James Arthur and Rudolph F. Ingerle (1879 – 1950).

American landscape painters referred to the poem to add an epic dimension to their patriotic celebration of the wonders of the national landscape. Albert Bierstadt presented his sunset piece, &quot;The Departure of Hiawatha,&quot; to Longfellow in 1868 when the poet was in England to receive an honorary degree at the University of Cambridge. Other examples include Thomas Moran&#x27;s &quot;Fiercely the Red Sun Descending, Burned His Way along the Heavens&quot; (1875), held by the North Carolina Museum of Art, and the panoramic waterfalls of &quot;Hiawatha and Minnehaha on their Honeymoon&quot; (1885) by Jerome Thompson (1814 – 1886). Thomas Eakins made his &quot;Hiawatha&quot; (c.1874) a visionary statement superimposed on the fading light of the sky.

Toward the end of the 19th century, artists deliberately emphasized the epic qualities of the poem, as in William de Leftwich Dodge&#x27;s &quot;Death of Minnehaha&quot; (1885). Frederic Remington demonstrated a similar quality in his series of 22 grisailles painted in oil for the 1890 deluxe photogravure edition of &quot;The Song of Hiawatha.&quot; One of the editions is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Dora Wheeler&#x27;s &quot;Minnehaha listening to the waterfall&quot; (1884) design for a needle-woven tapestry, made by the Associated Artists for the Cornelius Vanderbilt house, was also epic. The monumental quality survives into the 20th century in Frances Foy&#x27;s &quot;Hiawatha returning with Minnehaha&quot; (1937), a mural sponsored during the Depression for the Gibson City Post Office, Illinois.

===Film===
Several films have been made based on &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;. In 1901 and 1902, Charles and Katharine Bowden took still and moving images of the play that the Anishinaabe descendants of Schoolcraft&#x27;s informant, Chief Shingwauk, staged in Debarats, Ontario, on a regular schedule from June through August starting in 1900. Katharine Bowden used this film in a program she performed on the Lyceum and Chautauqua circuits between 1903 and 1910. Some portions of the Bowden film have been restored and digitized by the Chicago Film Archives. Simulataneously, Canadian Joe Rosenthal shot a 15 minute film, &quot;Hiawatha, the Messiah of the Ojibway.&quot; Released in 1903, the footage has not been found, but publicity stills of the film suggest it was based on the same cast of Ojibwe actors at Debarats as the Bowden film. 

William V. Ranous directed a one-reel version with a non-native cast in 1909. Producer Carl Laemmle followed up the film with a sequel in 1910 titled &quot;The Death of Minnehaha.&quot; In 1913, Edgar Lewis directed &quot;Hiawatha&quot;, the first feature film to cast Native Americans in leading roles. Seneca actor and artist Jesse Cornplanter starred as Hiawatha, and Soon-goot, a 17 year old Native American portrayed Minnehaha.

The 1952 film &quot;Hiawatha&quot;, directed by Kurt Neumann, cast non-Native actors in the leading roles. Vince Edwards was cast in the role of Hiawatha, and Yvette Duguay was cast as Minnehaha.

The 1997 film &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, directed by Jeffrey Shore, starred Cherokee actor Litefoot as Hiawatha, Iñupiat and Cree (Métis) actress Irene Bedard as Minnehaha, and Oneida actor Graham Greene as O Kagh. Saulteaux Anishinaabe actor Adam Beach played Chibiabos. Irene Bedard also voiced the protagonist in the 1995 Disney film &quot;Pocahontas&quot;.

===In popular culture===
In the 1979 &quot;Family&quot; sketch &quot;Carl&#x27;s Grave&quot; on Carol Burnett &amp; Company, the character of Eunice, portrayed by Burnett, at the insistence of her Mama, Thelma Harper, portrayed by American actress Vicki Lawrence, begins a recitation of Hiawatha she learned as a child while at her father&#x27;s grave.

===Parodies===
Parodies of the &quot;Song of Hiawatha&quot; (and especially its couplet, &quot;By the shores of Gitche Gumee / By the shining Big-Sea-Water&quot;) emerged immediately on its publication. &quot;The New York Times&quot; even reviewed one such parody four days before reviewing Longfellow&#x27;s original poem. This was &quot;Pocahontas: or the Gentle Savage&quot;, a comic extravaganza which included extracts from an imaginary Viking poem, &quot;burlesquing the recent parodies, good, bad, and indifferent, on &quot;The Song of Hiawatha.&quot;&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; quoted:
In 1856 there appeared a 94-page parody, &quot;The Song of Milkanwatha: Translated from the Original Feejee&quot;. Probably the work of Rev. George A. Strong, it was ascribed on the title page to &quot;Marc Antony Henderson&quot; and to the publishers &quot;Tickell and Grinne&quot;. The work following the original chapter by chapter and one passage later became famous:
Over time, an elaborated version stand-alone version developed, titled &quot;The Modern Hiawatha&quot;:
At Wallack&#x27;s Theatre in New York a parody titled &quot;Hiawatha; or, Ardent Spirits and Laughing Water,&quot; by Charles Melton Walcot, premiered on 26 December 1856.

In England, Lewis Carroll published &quot;Hiawatha&#x27;s Photographing&quot; (1857), which he introduced by noting (in the same rhythm as the Longfellow poem), &quot;In an age of imitation, I can claim no special merit for this slight attempt at doing what is known to be so easy. Any fairly practised writer, with the slightest ear for rhythm, could compose, for hours together, in the easy running metre of &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;. Having then distinctly stated that I challenge no attention in the following little poem to its merely verbal jingle, I must beg the candid reader to confine his criticism to its treatment of the subject.&quot; A poem of some 200 lines, it describes Hiawatha&#x27;s attempts to photograph the members of a pretentious middle-class family ending in disaster.
1865 saw the Scottish-born immigrant James Linen&#x27;s &quot;San Francisco (in imitation of Hiawatha)&quot;.
During World War I, Owen Rutter, a British officer of the Army of the Orient, wrote &quot;Tiadatha&quot;, describing the city of Salonica, where several hundred thousand soldiers were stationed on the Macedonian Front in 1916–1918:
In 1926, cartoonist Milt Gross published &quot;Hiawatta witt No Odder Poems&quot;, a Yiddish-English parody with comic illustrations. It begins:
Another parody was &quot;Hakawatha&quot; (1989), by British computer scientist Mike Shields, writing under the pen name F. X. Reid, about a frustrated computer programmer:
The poem was also parodied in three cartoon shorts, all of which featured inept protagonists who are beset by comic calamities while hunting. The connection is made plain by the scenes being introduced by a mock-solemn intonation of lines from the poem. The most famous was the 1937 Silly Symphony &quot;Little Hiawatha,&quot; whose hero is a small boy whose pants keep falling down. The 1941 Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;Hiawatha&#x27;s Rabbit Hunt&quot; features Bugs Bunny and a pint-sized version of Hiawatha in quest of rabbit stew. The 1944 MGM cartoon &quot;Big Heel-watha,&quot; directed by Tex Avery, follows the overweight title character&#x27;s effort to win the hand of the chief&#x27;s daughter by catching Screwy Squirrel. In his comic book adventure &#x27;Land of the Pygmy Indians,&#x27; American artist Carl Barks introduces a tribe of pint-sized Indigenous people north of Lake Superior who react to Uncle Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s intrusion: &quot;Flee, Peeweegahs, to the forest! / Flee the mighty, warlike strangers! / They have come to make great trouble / In the land of the Peeweegahs!&quot; At the same time as Barks&#x27;s story, Mad Magazine, in its &#x27;Trashery of Unknown Poetry,&#x27; published a spoof called &#x27;Hiya, Watha!&#x27; which ran in part: &quot;At the Restaurant Nokomis / Way uptown on Forty-Second [42nd Street in NYC], / Goes the shoe clerk Melvin Watha / Guzzles cola laced with bourbon / Doesn&#x27;t pay the least attention / When the far more cheery drunkards / Call out gaily, &#x27;Hiya, Watha!&#x27; / Keeps on boozing, grows more sullen / Falls across the bar unconscious&quot; (1953)

<text>General Sir Horace Lockwood Smith-Dorrien, (26 May 1858 – 12 August 1930) was a British Army General. One of the few British survivors of the Battle of Isandlwana as a young officer, he also distinguished himself in the Second Boer War.

Smith-Dorrien held senior commands in the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) during the First World War. He commanded II Corps at the Battle of Mons, the first major action fought by the BEF, and the Battle of Le Cateau, where he fought a vigorous and successful defensive action contrary to the wishes of the Commander-in-Chief Sir John French, with whom he had had a personality clash dating back some years. In the spring of 1915 he commanded the Second Army at the Second Battle of Ypres. He was relieved of command by French for requesting permission to retreat from the Ypres Salient to a more defensible position.

==Early life==
Horace Smith-Dorrien was born at Haresfoot, a house near Berkhamsted, in the county of Hertfordshire to Colonel Robert Algernon Smith-Dorrien and Mary Ann Drever. He was the twelfth child of sixteen; his eldest brother was Thomas Smith-Dorrien-Smith, the Lord Proprietor of the Isles of Scilly from 1872 until 1918. Another elder brother was Rear-Admiral Arthur Hale Smith-Dorrien. He was educated at Harrow and on 26 February 1876 entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

==Career==
On graduation from the Royal Military College in 1877 he had hoped to receive an infantry commission with the 95th Rifle Brigade, but instead received one with the 95th (Derbyshire) Regiment of Foot, later to become the Sherwood Foresters.

==Zulu War==
On 1 November 1878, he was posted to South Africa where he was employed as a Transport Officer. He was present at the Battle of Isandlwana during the Anglo-Zulu War on 22 January 1879, serving with the British invasion force as a transport officer for a detachment of Royal Artillery. As the Zulu impis overwhelmed the British lines, destroying it in hand-to-hand fighting, Smith-Dorrien narrowly escaped on his transport pony over 20 miles of rough terrain with twenty Zulu warriors in running pursuit, crossing the Buffalo River, 80 yards wide and with a strong current, by holding the tail of a loose horse. Smith-Dorrien was one of fewer than fifty British survivors from the battle (many more native African troops on the British side also survived), and one of only five Imperial officers to escape it with his life. Because of his conduct in trying to help other soldiers escape from the battlefield, including a colonial commissariat officer named Hamer whose life he saved, he was recommended for the Victoria Cross, but it was not awarded. He took part in the rest of that war. His observations on the difficulty of opening ammunition boxes led to changes in British Army practice for the rest of the war (though modern commentators argue that this was not as important a factor in the defeat as was thought at the time).

==Egypt, India and Sudan==
Smith-Dorrien served in Egypt under Evelyn Wood. He was promoted captain on 1 April 1882, appointed assistant chief of police in Alexandria on 22 August 1882, then given command of Mounted Infantry in Egypt on 3 September 1882, and was seconded to the Egyptian army (1 February 1884). During this time, he forged a lifelong friendship with the then Major Kitchener. He met Gordon more than once, but his bad knee kept him off the expedition to relieve Khartoum. He served on the Suakin Expedition. On 30 December 1885, he witnessed the Battle of Gennis, where the British Army fought in red coats for the last time. The next day (31 December 1885) he was given his first independent command, 150 men (a mixture of hussars, mounted infantry and Egyptians) with fifty infantry in reserve. His task was to capture nine Arab river supply boats (nuggars), in order to achieve which he had to exceed his orders by going beyond the village of Surda, making a 60-mile journey on horseback in 24 hours. For this, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in 1886.

Smith-Dorrien then left active command to go to the Staff College, Camberley (1887–89). Staff College was not yet much respected, and he later recorded that he devoted much time to sport whilst there.

He was posted to India, and promoted major on 1 May 1892. He became Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General, Bengal, on 1 April 1893 and then Assistant Adjutant General, Bengal, on 27 October 1894. He returned to his regiment where he commanded troops during the Tirah Campaign of 1897–98.

In 1898, he transferred back to Egypt. He was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 20 May 1898 and appointed Commanding Officer of the 13th Sudanese Battalion (16 July 1898). He fought at the Battle of Omdurman (2 September 1898), where his infantry fired at Devishes from entrenched positions. He commanded the British troops during the Fashoda incident. He was promoted brevet colonel 16 November 1898 and Commanding Officer of the Sherwood Foresters and substantive lieutenant-colonel (1 January 1899).

==South Africa==
On 31 October 1899, he shipped to South Africa for the Second Boer War, arriving at Durban 13 December 1899, in the middle of &quot;Black Week&quot;. On 2 February 1900, Lord Roberts put him in command of the 19th Brigade and, on 11 February, he was promoted to major general, making him one of youngest generals in the British Army at the time. He later commanded a division in South Africa.

He provided covering fire for French&#x27;s Cavalry Division at Klipsdrift, and played an important role at the Battle of Paardeberg (18 to 27 February 1900), where he was summoned by Lord Roberts and asked for his views in the presence of Lord Kitchener, French and Henry Colvile. He argued for the use of sapping and fire support, rather than attacking the entrenched enemy over open ground. Kitchener followed him to his horse to remonstrate that he would be &quot;a made man&quot; if he attacked as Kitchener wished, to which he replied he had given his views and would only attack if ordered to do so. A week later he took the laager after careful assault.

At Sanna&#x27;s Post (31 March 1900), Smith-Dorrien ignored inept orders from Colvile to leave wounded largely unprotected and managed an orderly retreat without further casualties. He took part in the Battle of Leliefontein (7 November 1900). On 6 February 1901, Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s troops were attacked in the Battle of Chrissiesmeer.

Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s qualities as a commander meant he was one of few British commanders to enhance his reputation during this war. Smith-Dorrien was mentioned three times in despatches in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; (including by Lord Kitchener dated 23 June 1902), and Ian Hamilton later wrote highly of his performance and his grasp of the men&#x27;s morale, whilst Roberts also thought highly of his South Africa performance. He was at the top of a list (21 September 1901) of eighteen successful commanders of columns or groups of columns, including Haig and Allenby, whom French commended to Lord Roberts.

==India==

On 22 April 1901, he received orders to return to India where he was made Adjutant-General (6 November 1901) under Kitchener (who returned to India after the end of the Second Boer War, in late 1902). He was placed in command of the 4th (Quetta) Division in Baluchistan, a post he held from 30 June 1903 until 1907. He was raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1904 and promoted lieutenant general on 9 April 1906. He introduced the Staff ride, erroneously attributed by Terraine to Haig. He also helped found the Staff College at Quetta in 1907.

Smith-Dorrien remained neutral in the dispute between Kitchener (Commander-in-Chief India) and the Viceroy Lord Curzon. Kitchener&#x27;s predecessor, Sir Arthur Power Palmer, was his wife&#x27;s uncle.

==Aldershot==

Smith-Dorrien returned to England and, on 1 December 1907, became GOC of the Aldershot Command. Unlike many senior generals of the era, Smith-Dorrien could speak to troops with ease and was greatly admired by regimental officers. In prewar training he wanted &quot;individual initiative and intelligence&quot; in British soldiers. He later wrote: &quot;one could never become an up-to-date soldier in the prehistoric warfare to be met with against the Dervishes&quot;. Smith-Dorrien improved the frequency and methods of training in marksmanship of all soldiers (including cavalry, and including shooting at moving targets). During this period, the higher ranks of the army were divided on the best use of cavalry. Smith-Dorrien, along with Lord Roberts, Sir Ian Hamilton and others, doubted that cavalry could often be used as &quot;cavalry&quot;, i.e. that they should still be trained to charge with sword and lance, instead thinking they would be more often deployed as mounted infantry, i.e. using horses for mobility but dismounting to fight. To this end, he took steps to improve the marksmanship of the cavalry. This did not endear him to the &quot;arme blanche&quot; (&#x27;pro-cavalry&#x27;) faction, which included French and Douglas Haig, and whose views prevailed after the retirement of Lord Roberts.

At Aldershot, Smith-Dorrien instituted a number of reforms designed to improve the lot of the ordinary soldier. He abandoned the practice of posting pickets to trawl the streets for drunk soldiers outside the base, more than doubled the number of playing fields available to the men, cut down trees, and built new and better barracks. His reforms earned many plaudits but were treated as an implied criticism by his predecessor, Sir John French, with whom he had still been on relatively cordial terms at the end of the South African War. Aylmer Haldane recorded that at the 1909 manoeuvres French was &quot;unfair&quot; in summing up for Arthur Paget against Smith-Dorrien. On 21 August 1909 he lectured all his cavalry officers – in the 16th Lancers’ mess – about the importance of improving their men&#x27;s musketry. He also tried to get the army to replace the old Maxim gun with the new Vickers Maxim gun, which weighed less than half as much and had a better water-cooling system but the War Office did not approve the expenditure.

By 1910 the feud between French and Smith-Dorrien was common knowledge throughout the Army. Smith-Dorrien objected to French’s womanising, a fact which Richard Holmes attributes in part to Smith-Dorrien being happily married to a young and pretty wife; French’s nephew later claimed to have overheard &quot;a ferocious exchange&quot; between them, in which Smith-Dorrien declared &quot;Too many whores around your headquarters, Field-Marshal&quot;. In 1911, he was made Aide-de-Camp to King George V. He was part of the King&#x27;s hunt in the Chitwan area of Nepal; on 19 December 1911, Smith-Dorrien killed a rhino and on the following day shot a bear.

==Southern Command==
On 1 March 1912, he was appointed GOC Southern Command, taking over from General Sir Charles Douglas while Haig had succeeded him as GOC Aldershot. At Southern Command he had jurisdiction over twelve counties and many regimental depots. He had experience of dealing with Territorials (who would make up much of II Corps in 1914) for the first time and instigated training on fire-and-movement withdrawals which would also prove useful at Le Cateau. He was promoted to full general (10 August 1912) and raised to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in 1913.

Although Smith-Dorrien was perfectly urbane and, by the standards of the day, kind-hearted towards his troops, he was notorious for furious outbursts of bad temper, which could last for hours before his equilibrium was restored. It has been suggested that the pain from a knee injury was one cause of his ill temper. It was rumoured that Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s temper was caused by some kind of serious illness. Esher (a royal courtier who exercised great influence over military appointments) had dined with Smith-Dorrien (28 January 1908) to see if he was indeed &quot;changed and weakened&quot;. Lord Crewe (letter to Seely 5 September 1913) turned him down for the post of Commander-in-Chief India because of his foul temper (A.J. Smithers, probably wrongly, blames French&#x27;s enmity for denying Smith-Dorrien the promotion). Unlike French, he was politically astute enough to avoid becoming entangled in the Curragh incident of 1914. Unlike a number of British generals of the era, Smith-Dorrien was not a political intriguer.

==First World War==
In 1914, the Public Schools Officers&#x27; Training Corps annual camp was held at Tidworth Pennings, near Salisbury Plain. Lord Kitchener was to review the cadets, but the imminence of the war kept him elsewhere, and Smith-Dorrien was sent instead. He surprised the two-or-three thousand cadets by declaring (in the words of Donald Christopher Smith, a Bermudian cadet who was present) &quot;that war should be avoided at almost any cost, that war would solve nothing, that the whole of Europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin, and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated. In our ignorance I, and many of us, felt almost ashamed of a British General who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments, but during the next four years, those of us who survived the holocaust – probably not more than one-quarter of us – learned how right the General&#x27;s prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it.&quot;

With the outbreak of the First World War, he was given command of the Home Defence Army, part of Ian Hamilton&#x27;s Home Defence Central Force. However, following the sudden death of Sir James Grierson, he was placed in charge of the British Expeditionary Force II Corps, by Lord Kitchener, the new Secretary of State for War. Field Marshal Sir John French had wanted Sir Herbert Plumer but Kitchener chose Smith-Dorrien as he knew he could stand up to French, and in the full knowledge that French disliked him. Kitchener admitted to Smith-Dorrien that he had doubts about appointing him, but put them to one side.

Smith-Dorrien arrived at GHQ (20 August) and formally asked French&#x27;s permission to keep a special diary to report privately to the King as His Majesty had requested. French could hardly refuse, but this further worsened their relations. Smith-Dorrien later claimed in his memoirs that French had received him &quot;pleasantly&quot;, but his diary at the time simply records matter-of-factly that he &quot;motored into Le Cateau and saw the Commander-in-Chief&quot; which may be suspiciously brief in contrast to the diary&#x27;s normally detailed description of other events. There was also personal friction between George Forestier-Walker and Johnnie Gough, the chiefs of staff of II Corps and I Corps respectively.

===Mons (23 August 1914)===
French still believed (22 August) that there were only light German forces facing the BEF, but after hearing intelligence that German forces were stronger than thought and that the BEF had moved far ahead of Lanrezac&#x27;s Fifth French Army on its right, Sir John cancelled the planned further advance. He told Lanrezac that he would hold his current position for another 24 hours.

French&#x27;s and Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s accounts differ about the conference at 5.30am on 23 August. French&#x27;s account in his memoirs &quot;1914&quot; stated that he had become doubtful of the advance into Belgium and warned his officers to be ready to attack or retreat. This agrees largely with French&#x27;s diary at the time, in which he wrote that he had warned Smith-Dorrien that the Mons position might not be tenable. When &quot;1914&quot; was published, Smith-Dorrien claimed that French had been &quot;in excellent form&quot; at the meeting and had still been planning to advance. However, in his own memoirs Smith-Dorrien admitted that French had talked of either attacking or retreating, although he claimed that it had been he who had warned that the Mons position was untenable. Edmonds in the &quot;Official History&quot; agreed that French had probably been prepared either to attack or to retreat. Edmonds – who was not an eyewitness – later claimed in his memoirs that French had instructed Smith-Dorrien to &quot;give battle&quot; on the line of the Conde Canal, and that when Smith-Dorrien queried whether he was to attack or defend he was simply told, after French had whispered with Murray, &quot;Don’t ask questions, do as you are told&quot;.

Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s II Corps took the brunt of a heavy assault by the German forces at Mons, with the Germans under von Kluck attempting a flanking manoeuvre. Forestier-Walker, Chief of Staff II Corps, was driven by Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s foul temper to attempt to resign his post during the Battle of Mons but was told by the BEF Chief of Staff Murray &quot;not to be an ass&quot;. During the battle of Mons Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s car was almost struck by a German shell.

===Retreat to Le Cateau (24–25 August)===
French ordered a general retreat, during which I Corps (under Lt-General Douglas Haig) and II Corps became separated, II Corps marching down an old Roman road west of the Forest of Mormal, and I Corps marching to the east of that dense forest. French agreed to Haig&#x27;s retreat east of the Forest (Haig Diary, 24 August) without, apparently, the initial knowledge of Smith-Dorrien. Joseph Joffre had intended that both BEF Corps should pass west of the Forest. Smith-Dorrien was at GHQ at Bavai at 1800 on 24 August – he sought orders from Sir John, but was told to do as he pleased and that Haig would be starting at 0500 the next morning. Smith-Dorrien later recorded that he “remonstrated” with Sir John that he wanted to begin his retreat soon after midnight and have his rearguard underway by 0500, to lessen the risk of their being pressed by the Germans, and that Sir John “concurred”, but that Haig could still move east of the Forest as he intended. Smith-Dorrien recorded that he “implored” Archibald Murray to issue an order that both Corps were to move west of the Forest. Smith-Dorrien’s biographer AJ Smithers believes it more likely that he “bullied” Murray into issuing an order, and is highly critical of Sir John for failing to “grip” the situation. Orders were finally issued at 2015, and were later published as Appendix XIII of the relevant volume of the Official History. Prior to the publication of the Official History, Sir John had falsely claimed in his unreliable memoirs (&quot;1914&quot;) that he had already issued the orders at 1500.

Murray noted in his diary (25 August) that GHQ had moved back from Le Cateau to St Quentin and that I Corps was being heavily engaged by night (at Landrecies) – making no mention of II Corps&#x27;s situation. Because the German plan was to envelop the BEF from the west, most of their pressure fell on II Corps, which had already suffered higher casualties (2,000) in its fighting withdrawal on 24–25 August than at Mons the previous day (1,600). Smith-Dorrien later remarked on Sir John’s failure to explain in his memoirs how the eight-mile gap between the two British corps had come about, that had it been he rather than Haig who had ignored orders Sir John would have criticised him for it, and that had the order been followed both BEF Corps would have been concentrated at Le Cateau by the night of 25/26 August under Sir John’s personal command.

===Le Cateau (26 August)===
French had a long discussion with Murray and Wilson (25 August) as to whether the BEF should stand and fight at Le Cateau, a position which had been chosen for &quot;both&quot; I and II Corps to hold after they had retreated on either side of the Forest of Mormal. II Corps had been harried by German forces as it retreated west of the forest and Sir John wanted to fall back as agreed with Joffre and hoped that the BEF could pull out of the fight altogether and refit behind the River Oise. Wilson issued orders to Smith-Dorrien to retreat from Le Cateau the next day.

On the evening of 25 August 1914 Smith-Dorrien was unable to locate the 4th Division and Cavalry Division. Allenby (GOC Cavalry Division) reached him at 2am on 26 August 1914, and reported that his horses and men were &quot;pretty well played out&quot;, and unless they retreated under cover of darkness there would be no choice but to fight in the morning. Allenby agreed to act under Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s orders. Hamilton (GOC 3rd Division) also reported that his men would be unable to get away before 9am, which also left little choice but to fight, lest isolated forces be overwhelmed piecemeal by the Germans. A French cavalry corps under Sordet, and especially its artillery, also took part on the west flank.

French was awakened at 2am on 26 August 1914 with news that Haig&#x27;s I Corps was under attack at Landrecies, and ordered Smith-Dorrien (3:50 am) to assist him. Smith-Dorrien replied that he was &quot;unable to move a man&quot;. This irritated French, as Haig (who already had serious doubts about French&#x27;s competence) was a protégé of his.

Smith-Dorrien finally managed to locate Snow (GOC of the newly arrived 4th Division), at 5:00 am (his brigades were assembling in their positions between 3:30 am and 5:30 am). He was not under Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s orders but agreed to assist II Corps. Smith-Dorrien then cancelled his order to retreat and decided to stand and fight at Le Cateau. He still hoped for assistance from I Corps (Haig), which did not reach its intended position to the immediate east of Le Cateau. This news reached French at 5:00 am – woken from his sleep once again, and insisting that the exhausted Murray not be woken, he telegraphed back that he still wanted Smith-Dorrien to &quot;make every endeavour&quot; to fall back but that he had &quot;a free hand as to the method&quot;, which Smith-Dorrien took as handing him permission to make a stand. On waking properly, French ordered Wilson to telephone Smith-Dorrien and order him to break off as soon as possible. Wilson ended the conversation – by his own account – by saying &quot;Good luck to you. Yours is the first cheerful voice I&#x27;ve heard in three days.&quot; Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s slightly different recollection was that Wilson had warned him that he risked another Sedan.

Von Kluck believed that he was facing the entire BEF (numbering, he believed, six divisions) and hoped to envelop it on both flanks to its destruction, but lack of coordination among the German attacking forces thwarted this ambition.

===After Le Cateau===
Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s decision to stand and fight enraged French, who accused him of jeopardising the whole BEF. French and his staff believed that II Corps had been destroyed at Le Cateau, although its units reappeared and reassembled after the retreat. Haig, despite believing French to be incompetent, wrote in his journal (4 September 1914) of Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s &quot;ill-considered decision&quot; in electing to stand and fight at Le Cateau. Murray later (in 1933) called Smith-Dorrien &quot;a straight honourable gentleman, most lovable, kind and generous&quot; but thought he &quot;did wrong to fight other than a strong rearguard action&quot;. However, the historian John Terraine praised Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s decision, arguing that despite heavy casualties sustained by II Corps in the action, it materially slowed the German advance.

GHQ (French) fell back to Noyon on 26 August 1914, and then and the next day Huguet and other French-national liaison officers attached to it gave Joffre a tale with their communications of shattered British forces falling back from Le Cateau in defeat. In fact Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s staff had held II Corps&#x27; formation together, although at a meeting (held at 2am on 27 August 1914, as Smith-Dorrien had found GHQ&#x27;s present location with great difficulty) French accused him of being overly optimistic.

Smith-Dorrien (2 September 1914) recorded that his men were much fitter and had recovered their spirits after the Le Cateau engagement. Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s II Corps led the counter-attack upon the German advance at the subsequent First Battle of the Marne and the First Battle of the Aisne, Haig&#x27;s I Corps to his right being delayed by forests in its path of advance.

II Corps, with its heavy casualties was effectively temporarily broken up in late October 1914 to reinforce I Corps (Haig), but Smith-Dorrien was given command of the newly formed British Second Army when it was reconstituted on 26 December 1914. His writings from the time show that he was fully aware of the importance of artillery, machine guns and aircraft working in close cooperation with the infantry.

Smith-Dorrien later recorded that General French inflicted &quot;pin-pricks&quot; on him from February 1915 onwards, including the removal of Forestier-Walker as his Chief of Staff. This was supposedly on the grounds that Forestier-Walker was needed to command a division training in England, although two months later he was still waiting to receive its command. French told Haig that Smith-Dorrien was &quot;a weak spot&quot; (5 February 1915). During the Battle of Neuve Chapelle he was dissatisfied (13 March 1915) at the apparent &quot;lack of determination&quot; of Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s diversionary attacks. Smith-Dorrien was not always immune to the excessive optimism which British officers were expected to display throughout the war: Aylmer Haldane recorded in his diary on 15 March 1915 that prior to the battle Smith-Dorrien had been claiming that the war would be won in March 1915. French complained to Kitchener (Secretary of State for War) about him on 28 March 1915.

===Second Battle of Ypres===
At the Second Battle of Ypres, the British were defending a barely-tenable salient of ground, held at great cost at the First Battle of Ypres five months earlier. On 22 April 1915 the Germans used poison gas on the Western Front for the first time, and heavy casualties were sustained by the British and French troops.

On 27 April 1915, with a French counterattack to the north of the salient materializing later and on a smaller-scale than promised, Smith-Dorrien recommended withdrawal to the more defensible &quot;GHQ Line&quot;. French privately agreed with this analysis, but was angered that the suggestion came from Smith-Dorrien. French wanted the situation kept quiet so as not to distract from the upcoming attack upon Aubers Ridge by Haig&#x27;s First Army (one historian describes this behaviour on French&#x27;s part as &quot;cretinous&quot;). Smith-Dorrien wrote a long letter on 27 April 1915 explaining the situation to Robertson (then French&#x27;s Chief of the General Staff BEF). He received in response a curt telephone message telling him that, in French&#x27;s view, he had adequate troops to defend the salient. A few hours later written orders arrived, directing Smith-Dorrien to turn command of the salient over to Herbert Plumer and to lend Plumer his chief of staff and such other staff officers as Plumer required. (In practice this meant that Plumer&#x27;s V Corps, already holding the salient, became an autonomous force reporting directly to GHQ, with Smith-Dorrien left only with II Corps south of the salient). Plumer immediately asked permission for a withdrawal almost identical to that proposed by Smith-Dorrien. After a delay whilst Foch conducted another counterattack, French consented to the action.

On 30 April 1915, Haig wrote in his diary:

:Sir John also told me Smith-Dorrien had caused him much trouble. &#x27;He was quite unfit [(he said)] to hold the Command of an Army&#x27; so Sir J. had withdrawn all troops from him control except the II Corps. Yet Smith-D. stayed on! [He would not resign!] French is to ask Lord Kitchener to find something to do at home. ... He also alluded to Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s conduct on the retreat, and said he ought to have tried him by Court Martial, because (on the day of Le Cateau) he &#x27;had ordered him to retire at 8 am and he did not attempt to do so [but insisted on fighting in spite of his orders to retire&#x27;].

After French refused permission to retreat, Smith-Dorrien noted (6 May 1915) that the planned counterattack was a complete failure with casualties higher than predicted by GHQ. Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s offer to resign his command on 6 May 1915 was ignored, and on that same day French used the &#x27;pessimism&#x27; of the withdrawal recommendation as an excuse to sack him from command of Second Army altogether. &quot;Wully&quot; Robertson is said to have broken the news to him with the words &quot; &#x27;Orace, yer for &#x27;ome &quot; (Robertson was a former cavalry trooper [enlisted man] who dropped his aitches), although by another account he might have said &quot; &#x27;Orace, yer thrown &quot; (a cavalry metaphor).

The Official Historian Brigadier Edmonds later alleged that French had removed Smith-Dorrien as he was senior to Haig and stood in the way of Haig becoming Commander-in-Chief, and that Wilson had put the idea in French&#x27;s mind, but this may be doubtful as their antipathy went back a long way, and French was later (December 1915) replaced by Douglas Haig as Commander-in-Chief of the BEF against his will.

Smith-Dorrien was raised to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (14 May 1915) and was briefly appointed GOC First Home Army (22 June 1915).

===Remainder of the war===
After a period in Britain commanding First Army of Central Force, Smith-Dorrien was appointed GOC East Africa (22 November 1915) to fight the Germans in German East Africa (present day Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi) but pneumonia contracted during the voyage to South Africa prevented him from taking command. His former adversary, Jan Smuts, took on this command. Smith-Dorrien took no significant military part in the rest of the war. He returned to England in January 1916 and on 29 January 1917 was appointed lieutenant of the Tower of London.

He led a campaign in London for moral purity, calling for suppression of &quot;suggestive or indecent&quot; media.

===French&#x27;s memoirs===
French, partly in response to criticism inspired by Smith-Dorrien, later wrote a partial and inaccurate account of the opening of the war in his book &quot;1914&quot;, which attacked Smith-Dorrien. Smith-Dorrien, as a serving officer, was denied permission to reply in public.

French&#x27;s official despatch after Le Cateau had praised Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s &quot;rare and unusual coolness, intrepidity and determination&quot;. In &quot;1914&quot; French wrote that this had been written before he knew the full facts, and that Smith-Dorrien had risked destruction of his corps and lost 14,000 men and 80 guns (actual losses of each were around half of this number). Smith-Dorrien, in a private written statement, called &quot;1914&quot; &quot;mostly a work of fiction and a foolish one too&quot;.

==Family==
On 3 September 1902 (on leave between being Adjutant General, India and taking command of 4th Division), he married Olive Crofton Schneider (1881–1951) at St Peter&#x27;s, Eaton Square, London, in a ceremony performed by his brother Rev. Walter Smith-Dorrien.

Olive was the eldest daughter of Colonel John Henry Augustus Schneider and his wife, Mary Elizabeth (née Crofton) Schneider, of Oak Lea, Furness Abbey. Her brothers were Henry Crofton Schneider and Major Cyril Crofton Schneider. Olive&#x27;s mother was the stepsister of Gen. Sir Arthur Power Palmer GCB, GCIE, who died in 1904.

The Smith-Dorriens had three sons:
*Grenfell Horace Gerald Smith-Dorrien (born 1904) served in the army, reaching the rank of brigadier. He was killed by shellfire on 13 September 1944 during the Italian Campaign, whilst commanding the 169th (London) Infantry Brigade. His grave is in the Gradara War Cemetery, in the Commune of Gradara in the Province of Pesaro and Urbino.
*Peter Lockwood Smith-Dorrien (born 1907) was killed in the King David Hotel bombing on 22 July 1946.
*Bromley David Smith-Dorrien (1911–2001) He joined the Foresters in 1940. After the war, he worked to keep alive his father&#x27;s reputation, designing a first-day cover commemorating the Battle of Le Cateau and helping his father&#x27;s biographer A. J. Smithers. His grave is at Kennington Cemetery.

Horace and Olive Smith-Dorrien informally adopted Power Palmer&#x27;s two daughters, Frances Gabrielle (b. 1902) and Celia de Courcy (b. ca. 1903), who were left homeless after their mother, Power Palmer&#x27;s second wife, died in 1912.

Olive Smith-Dorrien was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1918.

==Later years and death==

Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s last position was as Governor of Gibraltar from 9 July 1918 until 26 May 1923, where he introduced an element of democracy and closed some brothels. According to Wyndham Childs in the summer of 1918, Smith-Dorrien tried, and nearly succeeded, in uniting the Comrades of the Great War, the National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers, and the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers into one organisation. The merger later took place in 1921 to form the British Legion, under the influence of Field Marshal Douglas Haig.

He retired in September 1923, living in Portugal and finally in England. He devoted much his time to the welfare and remembrance of Great War soldiers. He worked on his memoirs, which were published in 1925. As French was still alive at the time of writing, he still felt unable to rebut &quot;1914&quot;. Despite his treatment by French, in 1925, he journeyed across Europe to act as a pallbearer at French&#x27;s funeral, an act appreciated by French&#x27;s son.

He played himself in the film &quot;The Battle of Mons&quot;, released in 1926. In June 1925, he unveiled the war memorial in Memorial Avenue, Worksop. On 4 August 1930, he unveiled the Pozières Memorial.

Smith-Dorrien died on 12 August 1930 following injuries sustained in a car accident at Chippenham, in Wiltshire; he was 72 years old. His body was buried at the Rectory Lane Cemetery of St Peter&#x27;s Church, Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire. His grave is marked by a tall stone cross, once adorned by a bronze sword of sacrifice which has since been stolen. The grave was restored in 2018, although the sword is still missing.

His wife Olive outlived him by more than twenty years and died on 15 September 1951 in the Chelsea area of London.

==Legacy==

The following memorials have been established:

*Stall plate 14 in the Henry VII Chapel of Westminster Abbey (1913)
*In 1931, after his death, the Smith-Dorrien Memorial was added to the Sherwood Foresters Memorial in Crich, Derbyshire, which Smith-Dorrien himself had opened on 6 August 1923.

Several places and institutions around the world have been named after Horace Smith-Dorrien, including:

*Dorrien, a vineyard area in South Australia (1916)
*Mount Smith-Dorrien, Alberta, Canada (1918); the Smith-Dorrien Trail and Smith-Dorrien Creek, Alberta are also named after him.
*Smith-Dorrien Institute in Aldershot
*Smith Dorrien Road, Leicester
*Smith Dorrien Avenue, Smith Dorrien Bridge, and Smith Dorrien House, Gibraltar
*Smith Dorrien Street, Netherby, South Australia
*Smith-Dorrien Avenue, Esterhazy, Saskatchewan

John Betjeman, mentions Horace in Chapter III &quot;Highgate&quot; of his autobiographical blank-verse poem &quot;Summoned by Bells&quot;:

In late September, in the conker time,
When Poperinghe and Zillebeke and Mons
Boomed with five-nines, large sepia gravures
Of French, Smith-Dorrien and Haig were given
Gratis with each half-pound of Brooke Bond tea.

Horace also features in the poem &quot;Canada to England&quot; by Craven Langstroth Betts:
Lead out, lead out, Brave Mother, for the sake of sacked Louvain!
Give us our own Smith-Dorrien, yield us the van again!

<text>Operation Noble Eagle (ONE) is the United States and Canadian military operation related to homeland security and support to federal, state, and local agencies. The operation began 11 September 2001, in response to the September 11 attacks.

== History ==
Operation Noble Eagle began with the mobilization of thousands of National Guard and reserve personnel to perform security missions on military installations, airports and other potential targets such as bridges, power plants, and port facilities. These reservists were called to active duty under a mobilization authority known as a partial mobilization (10 USC 12302). In a time of national emergency declared by the President of the United States, partial mobilization authorizes the President to order members of the ready reserve to active duty for a period not to exceed 24 consecutive months. Additionally, in 2001 and 2002, thousands of members of the National Guard were activated at the order of their respective governors to provide additional security at airports. They were called up under Title 32 of the U.S. Code, which means they were under state control, but with federal pay and benefits. The Royal Canadian Air Force assisted in providing defense of the northern border of the United States. The United States Army&#x27;s 759th Military Police Battalion, 144th Military Police Company and the 177th Military Police Brigade were assigned the task of protecting the White House, the Pentagon and the Capitol, along with other Army National Guard units that were tasked with augmenting the U.S. Air Force (USAF) air defense perimeter around the National Capital Region.

=== Requirement ===
In an article dated June 2007 United States civilian and military leaders began to regard the costly air defense operation above North American cities as a permanent defense requirement demanding significant attention from North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The current focus is on improving command and control of the homeland air defense missions.

== Equipment ==
The United States Department of Defense provided F-15 Eagles and F-16 Fighting Falcons to this operation, and the Canadian Forces provided CF-18 Hornets. The US Army National Guard provided AN/TWQ-1 Avenger short range air defense systems to provide close range air defense protection under the control of the USAF Joint Air Defense Operations Center (JADOC) and CONR.

The JADOC Suite is an integrated USAF connectivity center used in point defense of the National Capital Region. The Suite provides capability for tactical C2 execution for the Joint Task Force/Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JTF/JFACC) under the Operation Noble Eagle (ONE) mission as part of the National Capital Region-Integrated Air Defense System (NCR-IADS - National Capital Region Integrated Air Defense Systems). It is currently fielded and operational. It was developed in response to an urgent need request for enhanced air defense of the NCR per SECDEF direction through a joint rapid acquisition cell. The architecture consists of an air surveillance fusion system and the C2 connectivity center, which includes a Link 16 capable terminal and Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) capability.

== Canadian NORAD Region ==
As the Canadian geographical component of NORAD, CANR provides airspace surveillance and control, and directs all air sovereignty activities for the Canadian NORAD Region. CANR and its assigned Royal Canadian Air Force assets throughout the country ensure air safety and security against potential air threats and have supported special events such as the G-8 Summit and the visits of foreign dignitaries.

The Canadian NORAD Region flew Operation Noble Eagle air defense protection missions in the Windsor, Ontario/Detroit, Michigan area on 5 February 2006, in support of Super Bowl XL at Ford Field. These types of missions had become more common at organized entertainment such as the Super Bowl.

<text>Angiography or arteriography is a medical imaging technique used to visualize the inside, or lumen, of blood vessels and organs of the body, with particular interest in the arteries, veins, and the heart chambers. Modern angiography is performed by injecting a radio-opaque contrast agent into the blood vessel and imaging using X-ray based techniques such as fluoroscopy. With time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic ressonance it is no longer necessary to use a contrast.

The word itself comes from the Greek words ἀγγεῖον &quot;angeion&quot; &#x27;vessel&#x27; and γράφειν &quot;graphein&quot; &#x27;to write, record&#x27;. The film or image of the blood vessels is called an &quot;angiograph&quot;, or more commonly an &quot;angiogram&quot;. Though the word can describe both an arteriogram and a venogram, in everyday usage the terms angiogram and arteriogram are often used synonymously, whereas the term venogram is used more precisely.

The term angiography has been applied to radionuclide angiography and newer vascular imaging techniques such as CO2 angiography, CT angiography and MR angiography. The term &quot;isotope angiography&quot; has also been used, although this more correctly is referred to as isotope perfusion scanning.

==History==

The technique was first developed in 1927 by the Portuguese physician and neurologist Egas Moniz at the University of Lisbon to provide contrasted X-ray cerebral angiography in order to diagnose several kinds of nervous diseases, such as tumors, artery disease and arteriovenous malformations. Moniz is recognized as the pioneer in this field. He performed the first cerebral angiogram in Lisbon in 1927, and Reynaldo dos Santos performed the first aortogram in the same city in 1929. In fact, many current angiography techniques were developed by the Portuguese at the University of Lisbon. For example, in 1932, Lopo de Carvalho performed the first pulmonary angiogram via venous puncture of the superior member. In 1948 the first cavogram was performed by Sousa Pereira. With the introduction of the Seldinger technique in 1953, the procedure became markedly safer as no sharp introductory devices needed to remain inside the vascular lumen. Radial access technique for angiography can be traced back to 1989, when Lucien Campeau first cannulated the radial artery to perform a coronary angiogram.

==Technique==
Depending on the type of angiogram, access to the blood vessels is gained most commonly through the femoral artery, to look at the left side of the heart and at the arterial system; or the jugular or femoral vein, to look at the right side of the heart and at the venous system. Using a system of guide wires and catheters, a type of contrast agent (which shows up by absorbing the X-rays), is added to the blood to make it visible on the X-ray images.

The X-ray images taken may either be still, displayed on an image intensifier or film, or motion images. For all structures except the heart, the images are usually taken using a technique called digital subtraction angiography or DSA. Images in this case are usually taken at 2–3 frames per second, which allows the interventional radiologist to evaluate the flow of the blood through a vessel or vessels. This technique &quot;subtracts&quot; the bones and other organs so only the vessels filled with contrast agent can be seen. The heart images are taken at 15–30 frames per second, not using a subtraction technique. Because DSA requires the patient to remain motionless, it cannot be used on the heart. Both these techniques enable the interventional radiologist or cardiologist to see stenosis (blockages or narrowings) inside the vessel which may be inhibiting the flow of blood and causing pain.

After the procedure has been completed, if the femoral technique is applied, the site of arterial entry is either manually compressed, stapled shut, or sutured in order to prevent access-site complications.
==Uses==
===Coronary angiography===

One of the most common angiograms performed is to visualize the coronary arteries. A long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter is used to administer the X-ray contrast agent at the desired area to be visualized. The catheter is threaded into an artery in the forearm, and the tip is advanced through the arterial system into the major coronary artery. X-ray images of the transient radiocontrast distribution within the blood flowing inside the coronary arteries allows visualization of the size of the artery openings. The presence or absence of atherosclerosis or atheroma within the walls of the arteries cannot be clearly determined.

Coronary angiography can visualize coronary artery stenosis, or narrowing of the blood vessel. The degree of stenosis can be determined by comparing the width of the lumen of narrowed segments of blood vessel with wider segments of adjacent vessel.

The coronary angiography is performed under local anaesthesia. The patient is awake during the procedure. An incision is made in the groin, wrist, or arm, and a catheter is inserted into the artery through it. An X-ray is used to guide the catheter to the area of blockage. A dye is inserted through the catheter to make the places of blockage visible.

When the catheter is in position, a thin wire with a balloon is guided to the place of blockage. The balloon is inflated to widen the artery, allowing the blood to flow freely. Often, a stent is used, and as the balloon is inflated, the stent in place expands and holds open the artery. The balloon is then deflated and removed, leaving the stent in place.

After the completion of the procedure, the catheter is removed, and the plug area is sealed using angio-seal.

The procedure takes around two hours, and the patient can be discharged after an overnight stay in the hospital, depending on the condition.

===Cerebral angiography===
Cerebral angiography provides images of blood vessels in and around the brain to detect abnormalities, including arteriovenous malformations and aneurysms. One common cerebral angiographic procedure is neuro-vascular digital subtraction angiography.

===Pulmonary angiography===

Pulmonary angiography is used to visualise the anatomy of pulmonary vessels. Pulmonary angiography may be used during embolization of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. In addition, pulmonary angiography may be performed during treatment of pulmonary embolisms. 

===Peripheral angiography===
Angiography is also commonly performed to identify vessels narrowing in patients with leg claudication or &quot;cramps&quot;, caused by reduced blood flow down the legs and to the feet; in patients with renal stenosis (which commonly causes high blood pressure) and can be used in the head to find and repair stroke. These are all done routinely through the femoral artery, but can also be performed through the brachial or axillary (arm) artery. Any stenoses found may be treated by the use of balloon angioplasty, stenting, or atherectomy.

=== Visceral angiography ===
A common indication for angiography is to evaluate and guide treatment for internal (e.g. gastrointestinal) bleeding. Angiography may also be used during hemorrhoidal artery embolization for treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids. 

===Fluorescein angiography===
Fluorescein angiography is a medical procedure in which a fluorescent dye is injected into the bloodstream. The dye highlights the blood vessels in the back of the eye so they can be photographed. This test is often used to manage eye disorders.

===OCT angiography===
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a technology using near-infrared light to image the eye, in particular penetrate the retina to view the micro-structure behind the retinal surface.
Ocular OCT angiography (OCTA) is a method leveraging OCT technology to assess the vascular health of the retina.

===Microangiography===
Microangiography is commonly used to visualize tiny blood vessels.

===Post mortem CT angiography===

Post mortem CT angiography for medicolegal cases is a method initially developed by a virtopsy group. Originating from that project, both watery and oily solutions have been evaluated.

While oily solutions require special deposition equipment to collect waste water, watery solutions seem to be regarded as less problematic. Watery solutions also were documented to enhance post mortem CT tissue differentiation whereas oily solutions were not. Conversely, oily solutions seem to only minimally disturb ensuing toxicological analysis, while watery solutions may significantly impede toxicological analysis, thus requiring blood sample preservation before post mortem CT angiography.

==Complications==

Angiography is a relatively safe procedure. But it does have some minor and very few major complications. After an angiogram, a sudden shock can cause a little pain at the surgery area, but heart attacks and strokes usually do not occur, as they may in bypass surgery. The risk of complications from angiography can be reduced with a prior CT scan by providing clinicians with more information about number and positioning of the clots in advance. 

===Cerebral angiography===
Major complications in cerebral angiography such as in digital subtraction angiography or contrast MRI are also rare but include stroke, an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic other medication or the contrast medium, blockage or damage to one of the access veins in the leg, pseudoaneurysm at the puncture site; or thrombosis and embolism formation. Bleeding or bruising at the site where the contrast is injected are minor complications, delayed bleeding can also occur but is rare.

===Additional risks===
The contrast medium that is used usually produces a sensation of warmth lasting only a few seconds, but may be felt in a greater degree in the area of injection. If the patient is allergic to the contrast medium, much more serious side effects are inevitable; however, with new contrast agents the risk of a severe reaction is less than one in 80,000 examinations. Additionally, damage to blood vessels can occur at the site of puncture/injection, and anywhere along the vessel during passage of the catheter. If digital subtraction angiography is used instead, the risks are considerably reduced because the catheter does not need to be passed as far into the blood vessels; thus lessening the chances of damage or blockage.

===Infection===
Antibiotic prophylaxis may be given in those procedures that are not clean, or clean procedures that results in generation of infarcted or necrotic tissues such as embolisation. Routine diagnostic angiography is often considered a clean procedure. Prophylaxis is also given to prevent infection from infected space into blood stream.

===Thrombosis===
There are six risk factors causing thrombosis after arterial puncture: low blood pressure, small arterial diameter, multiple puncture tries, long duration of cannulation, administration of vasopressor/inotropic agents, and the usage of catheters with side holes.

<text>Arnold Stephanes dze Chikobava (; March 14 (26), 1898 – November 5, 1985) was a Georgian linguist and philologist best known for his contributions to Caucasian studies and for being one of the most active critics of Nicholas Marr&#x27;s controversial monogenetic &quot;Japhetic&quot; theory of language.

==Biography==
Chikobava was born in the small village of Sachikobavo in the Samegrelo region of western Georgia, then part of Imperial Russia. He was initially named Benedicte Chikobava but later changed his name to Arnold in order to differentiate himself from another Georgian academic named Benedicte Chikobava, who had caused some controversy in local newspapers and was being confused with the other Chikobava. 

He graduated from the recently established Tbilisi State University in 1922 and earned a degree there, later serving as a docent (1926–33) and professor (1933-85). For years, he headed the Department of Caucasian Studies at Tbilisi State University (1933–60), and the Department of Ibero-Caucasian languages at the Institute of Linguistics in Tbilisi (1936–85). The institute, briefly directed by Chikobava from 1950 to 1952, now bears his name. 

In 1941, he became one of the founding members of the Georgian Academy of Sciences and was elected to its Presidium from 1950 to 1963. For his prolific work, he was awarded numerous Soviet and international prizes and titles. He authored a series of Georgian dictionaries and influential works on the structure and history of Caucasian languages.

Most of his fame, however, came through his criticism of Marr&#x27;s speculative linguistic theory that had been adopted, for a while, as an official ideology by Soviet scholars. While most of Marr&#x27;s opponents came under heavy pressure from the Soviet authorities, Chikobava benefited from his friendship with the First Secretary of the Georgian Central Committee, Kandid Charkviani, and continued his attacks against Marr&#x27;s hypotheses. Finally, he sent his report to Joseph Stalin; he met Stalin personally in 1950. Soon, Stalin denounced Marr&#x27;s theory in his famous Pravda article on linguistics (one ghostwriter was, most probably, Chikobava himself).

Chikobava died in Tbilisi at the age of 87. He was buried on the grounds of Tbilisi State University.

<doc id="449973" wikidata="Q332574" url="?curid=449973" title="Dhu al-Kifl">
<text>Dhu al-Kifl (), also spelled Dhu l-Kifl, Dhul-Kifl, Zu al-Kifl, Zul Kifl, or Zu l-Kifl, is an Islamic prophet. Although his identity is unknown, his identity has been theorised and identified as various Hebrew Bible prophets and other figures, most commonly Ezekiel. Dhu al-Kifl is believed to have been exalted by Allah to a high station in life and is chronicled in the Qur&#x27;an as a man of the &quot;Company of the Good&quot;. Although not much is known of Dhu al-Kifl from other historical sources, all the writings from classical commentators, such as Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Kathir, speak of Dhu al-Kifl as a prophetic, saintly man who remained faithful in daily prayer () and worship ().

A tomb in the Ergani province of Diyarbakir, Turkey is believed by some to be the resting place of Prophet Dhu al-Kifl. It is located 5 km from the city centre on a hill called &quot;Makam Dağı&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Dhu al-Kifl&quot; literally means &quot;the possessor of , using a type of name where ذُو &quot;dhū&quot; (&quot;possessor of&quot;) precedes some characteristically associated feature. Such names were used of other notable figures in the Quran, for example &quot;Dhu al-Qarnayn&quot; (), and &quot;Dhu al-Nūn&quot; (), referring to Yunus. &quot;Kifl&quot; () is an archaic Arabic word meaning &quot;double&quot; or &quot;duplicate&quot;, from the root &quot;ka-fa-la&quot; (ك-ف-ل) meaning &quot;to double&quot; or &quot;to fold&quot;; it was also used for a fold of cloth. The name is generally understood to mean &quot;one of a double portion.&quot; Some scholars have suggested that the name means &quot;the man with the double recompense&quot; or rather &quot;the man who received recompense twice over&quot;, that is to say that it is a title for Job, as his family was returned to him according to the Qur&#x27;an and the Book of Job.

==In the Qur&#x27;an==
Dhu al-Kifl has been mentioned twice in the Qur&#x27;an, in the following verses:


In both cases, Dhu al-Kifl is mentioned in the context of a list of Qur&#x27;anic prophets, including many others not mentioned in the ayatayn quoted above.

== Identifications ==

===Ezekiel===
Some identify Dhu al-Kifl is Ezekiel. When the exile, monarchy, and state were annihilated, political and national life was no longer possible. In conformity with the two parts of his book, his personality and his preaching are alike, and the title Dhu al-Kifl means &quot;the one to double&quot; or &quot;to fold.&quot;

In a story repeated in a fragment from the Cairo Geniza and a work by the 12th century Jewish scholar Moses ben Jacob of Coucy, the tomb of Ezekiel is at al-Kifl and was visited by Jews. 

In his Qur&#x27;anic commentary, Abdullah Yusuf Ali says:
Al-Kifl is a town in southeastern Iraq on the Euphrates between Najaf and Hillah. Variant names for the shrine within al-Kifl are the Dhu&#x27;l Kifl Shrine, Marqad Dhu&#x27;l Kifl, Qubbat Dhu&#x27;l Kifl, Qabr al-Nabi Dhu al-Kifl, Dhu al-Kifl Shrine, Zul Kifl Shrine, Qabr Hazqiyal, Hazqiyal Shrine. &quot;Hazqiyal&quot; () is the Arabic version of the Hebrew name for Ezekiel, which was mostly utilized by Arabic-speaking Sephardic Jews. This indicates that the Jews equated Ezekiel and Dhu al-Kifl, and Muslim exegetes followed suit.

The Iraqi authorities assert that in 1316 (715–16 AH), the Il khan Öljaitü acquired the rights of guardianship over the tomb of Dhu al-Kifl from the Jewish community. Consequently, the shrine was renamed according to the Islamic nomenclature for the same prophet. Öljaitü added to the structure by building a mosque and a minaret and restored the shrine, implementing some alterations made clear by comparing its present state with pre-Ilkhanid travelers&#x27; descriptions.

The site remained a Muslim pilgrimage place until the beginning of the nineteenth century, when Menahem ibn Danyal, a wealthy Jew, successfully converted it back to a Jewish site and restored it. The minaret remained as the only witness to its tenure as an Islamic site. Although the mosque and minaret were built in the 14th century, the antiquity of the shrine and grave cannot be determined.

===Others===

Dhu al-Kifl has also been identified variously with Joshua, Obadiah, Isaiah, and even Gautama Buddha.

<doc id="449975" wikidata="Q5326339" url="?curid=449975" title="Earl of Mulgrave">
<text>The title Earl of Mulgrave has been created twice. The first time as a title in the Peerage of England and the second time as a Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The first creation was in the Peerage of England in 1626 for Edmund Sheffield, 3rd Baron Sheffield KG, who served as Lord Lieutenant of Yorkshire from 1603 to 1619. The Sheffield family descended from Sir Edmund Sheffield, second cousin of Henry VIII, who in 1547 was raised to the Peerage of England as &quot;Baron Sheffield of Butterwick&quot; and in 1549 was murdered in the streets of Norwich during Kett&#x27;s Rebellion. Upon the 1st Earl&#x27;s death in 1646 he was succeeded by his grandson Edmund, who was in turn succeeded by his son John. This 3rd Earl of Mulgrave KG was a notable Tory politician of the late Stuart period, who served under Queen Anne as Lord Privy Seal and Lord President of the Council. He was created &quot;Marquess of Normanby&quot; in 1694 and &quot;Duke of Buckingham and Normanby&quot; in 1703. These titles became extinct on the death of his son, the 2nd Duke in 1735.

The second creation was in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1812 for Henry Phipps, 3rd Baron Mulgrave. He was a general in the Army as well as a prominent politician, and notably served as Foreign Secretary from 1805 to 1806 and as First Lord of the Admiralty from 1807 to 1810. His grandfather William Phipps had married Lady Catherine Annesley, who was the daughter and heiress of James Annesley, 3rd Earl of Anglesey and his wife Lady Catherine Darnley (an illegitimate daughter of King James II by his mistress Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester). Lady Catherine Darnley had later married John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby, and hence Henry Phipps, 3rd Baron Mulgrave was the step-great-grandson of the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby. In 1812 this 3rd Baron Mulgrave was made &quot;Viscount Normanby, of Normanby in the County of York&quot; and &quot;Earl of Mulgrave&quot;, both titles in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Upon his death in 1831, the 1st Earl of Mulgrave was succeeded by his eldest son Constantine. This 2nd Earl of Mulgrave was also a noted politician and served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and as Home Secretary. In 1838 he was created &quot;Marquess of Normanby&quot; in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. As of 2010, the titles are held by Constantine Phipps, 5th Marquess of Normanby.

Other members of the Phipps family have also gained distinction. The Hon. Sir Charles Phipps, second son of the 1st Earl, was a prominent court official. Sir Constantine Phipps, son of the Hon. Edmund Phipps, third son of the 1st Earl, was British Ambassador to Belgium from 1900 to 1906, while his son Sir Eric Phipps was British Ambassador to Germany between 1933 and 1937 and to France between 1937 and 1939. Also, Sir William Phipps (or Phips), Governor of Massachusetts, was a member of another branch of the family.

<text>Raymond Anthony Lewis Jr. (born May 15, 1975) is an American former professional football linebacker who played his entire 17-year career for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes, where he earned All-America honors. He is considered one of the greatest linebackers of all time.

Lewis was selected by the Ravens in the first round of the 1996 NFL draft, and upon his retirement following the 2012 season, was the last remaining active player from the team&#x27;s inaugural season. Lewis immediately became a leader on defense and led the team in tackles as a rookie, the first of 14 times he led the Ravens in tackles.

In 2000, Lewis pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in connection with the stabbing deaths of two men; he testified as a key witness at the trial, and a jury determined the killings were acts of self-defense. The following season, he was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year and led the Ravens&#x27; record-setting defense, which established a 16-game single-season record for the fewest points allowed (165) and the fewest rushing yards allowed (970), to victory in Super Bowl XXXV. Lewis also became the second linebacker to win the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, and the first to win the award on the winning Super Bowl team. Lewis won his second Defensive Player of the Year award in 2003, becoming the sixth player to win the award multiple times. After a triceps tear that sidelined him for most of the 2012 regular season, Lewis returned for the Ravens&#x27; playoff run and earned his second Super Bowl victory in his final NFL game. On February 3, 2018, the fifth anniversary of his final game, Lewis was selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.

During his tenure with the Ravens, he accumulated 2,059 career combined tackles, including 1,568 solo tackles, both of which are NFL records. Due to his numerous accolades and prodigious football play, Lewis is widely considered to be the greatest middle linebacker in NFL history. He was a 13-time Pro Bowler, a 10-time All-Pro, and one of the few players in NFL history to play in a Pro Bowl in three decades (1990s, 2000s, and 2010s). He is also considered to be the greatest Baltimore Raven of all time, as well as one of the greatest defensive players of all time.

==Early life==
Raymond Anthony Lewis Jr. was born in Bartow, Florida in Central Florida, the oldest of five siblings. His mother was just 16 at the time of his birth, while his father was absent for most of his life. Not much was known about his father&#x27;s life other that he was a record-setting high school wrestler before he was incarcerated for drug-related offenses. As a boy, and the eventual older brother to four younger siblings, Lewis quickly became the man of the house. He helped his sisters with their hair and made sure his younger brother arrived at daycare on time. When his father&#x27;s contact became less frequent, he abandoned his last name and changed it to the last name of his mother&#x27;s boyfriend, Ray Lewis, when he entered Kathleen High School in Lakeland, Florida.

In addition to being a great high school football player, Lewis was a prolific wrestler, winning a Florida wrestling state title. He later revealed that his stepfather was extremely abusive towards his mother, and got a deck of 52 playing cards to start his push-up regimen, so he could get stronger to protect her. This also was the reason behind choosing the #52 jersey in his professional career. He is the older brother of former University of Maryland running back Keon Lattimore. Lewis was an All-American linebacker for the football team at Kathleen, overcoming his smaller size at the time with his intensity and instincts.

==College career==
Lewis enrolled in the University of Miami, where he was a member of the Miami Hurricanes football team. As a freshman, he was an immediate contributor and became a starter for the Hurricanes&#x27; final five games. He compiled 81 tackles, two sacks, two tackles for loss, and four pass deflections en route to being named to the freshman All-American team.

In his sophomore season, Lewis earned first-team All-American and All-Big East honors. Lewis led the Big East with 153 tackles and also contributed nine tackles for a loss, two sacks, and an interception for a Hurricanes team that had the nation&#x27;s top-ranked defense and finished No. 6 in both the writers&#x27; and coaches&#x27; polls.

Lewis&#x27;s junior campaign was even more successful, as he was again named to the All-American and All-Big East teams, and finished as runner-up for the Butkus Award, given to the top linebacker in college football. Lewis finished his junior season with 160 tackles, the second highest in University of Miami team history after Ed Weisacosky&#x27;s 164 in 1965.

Lewis led the Big East in tackles his last two seasons and accumulated the fifth most in Miami history despite playing only three seasons.

After the 1995 season, Lewis decided to forgo his final year of college eligibility and enter the NFL draft. The Baltimore Ravens, who were entering their inaugural season, selected Lewis 26th overall in the first round of the 1996 NFL draft. Lewis was the Ravens&#x27; second ever draft pick behind offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden who was selected #4 overall the same year. Lewis eventually earned his undergraduate degree in Arts and Science in 2004 at the University of Maryland University College.

==Professional career==

=== 1996 season: Rookie season ===

Lewis was the top-rated inside linebacker heading into the 1996 NFL Draft, in which Kevin Hardy was considered the draft&#x27;s only outstanding linebacker prospect. Taken as the fifth linebacker in the draft, Lewis was seen by scouts as possessing speed, tackling ability, and intensity, as well as being praised for his ability to go into pass coverage. But many considered his lack of size a potential liability. In his first career game, a week 1 19–14 victory over the Oakland Raiders, Lewis earned AFC Defensive Player of the Week for his seven-tackle performance, along with an unusual interception. Lewis earned &quot;USA Today&#x27;s&quot; All-Rookie team honors after his 15 tackles for loss led the NFL and 110 tackles led the Ravens in the 1996 season. He finished his rookie season with two and a half sacks, six pass deflections, and an interception on the season as the Ravens finished with a 4–12 record.

=== 1997 season ===

In week 9, against the Washington Redskins, Lewis earned his second AFC Defensive Player of the Week honor. Lewis recorded an NFL-best and career high 184 tackles in 1997, which also included 156 solo tackles, the most ever in single season, and earned his first Pro Bowl berth at the end of that season. In addition, Lewis totaled four sacks, an interception, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery, and 11 pass deflections in the Ravens&#x27; 6–9–1 season.

=== 1998 season ===

Lewis made his second trip to the Pro Bowl after recording 120 tackles, three sacks, two interceptions, a forced fumble, and seven pass deflections. He led the 6–10 Ravens in tackles for the third consecutive season. He was also named to &quot;The Sporting News&quot; All-Pro Team. In what would prove to be Hall of Fame Detroit Lions running back Barry Sanders&#x27;s final game, Lewis and the rest of the Ravens defense held him to just 41 rushing yards on 19 attempts.

=== 1999 season ===

In 1999, during the first game of the regular season against the St. Louis Rams, Lewis had 14 solo tackles, four tackles for loss, an interception, and a sack in the 27–10 loss.

In week 3 against the Cleveland Browns, Lewis had ten combined tackles and a sack in the 17–10 win. In week 4 against the Atlanta Falcons, Lewis finished with 12 combined tackles in the 19–13 overtime win. During week 5 against the Tennessee Titans, Lewis had 13 tackles and the only scored safety of his career in the 14–11 loss. In week 8 against the Buffalo Bills, Lewis had 14 tackles and a sack in the 13–10 loss. Despite the Ravens having an 8–8 regular season record, Lewis led the NFL in tackles with 165. He was named to a third-straight Pro Bowl and the All-Pro first team. In addition, he totaled three and a half sacks, three interceptions, eight pass deflections, a safety, and a forced fumble. Lewis won the 1999 NFL Alumni Linebacker Of The Year chosen by past NFL players voting according to the position they played.

=== 2000: Record-setting defense, Defensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl XXXV MVP ===

In 2000, Lewis led a defense which many call the greatest in NFL history for a single season. In week 2 of the regular season against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Lewis led the team in tackles with 11 tackles in the 39–36 win. In week 3 against the Miami Dolphins, Lewis had 11 tackles in the 19–6 loss. In week 6 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he finished 13 tackles and a fumble recovery in the 15–10 win. In week 13 against the Cleveland Browns, Lewis had five tackles and two sacks in the 44–7 blowout win. Lewis finished the regular season with a franchise leading 137 tackles, as well as two interceptions, six pass deflections, and three fumble recoveries. The team set a 16-game single-season record for fewest points allowed (165) and fewest rushing yards allowed (970). The team recorded four shutouts, one shy of the single-season record. The unit finished first league-wide in six key defensive categories. Including the postseason, and excluding three combined touchdowns that were given up by the Ravens offense and special teams, Baltimore&#x27;s defense allowed only 184 points in 20 games. After the regular season, he earned a unanimous All-Pro selection, and was once again named to start in the Pro Bowl. In the Wild Card Round against the Denver Broncos, Lewis had seven tackles and an interception in the 21–3 win. In the Divisional Round against the Tennessee Titans, Lewis had 12 combined tackles and an interception returned 50 yards for the clinching touchdown in the 24–10 win. In the AFC Championship against the Oakland Raiders, he had seven combined tackles and a fumble recovery in the 16–3 win. Lewis was named NFL Defensive Player of The Year for the 2000 season. The Ravens became only the second team to ever record a defensive shutout in a Super Bowl, as they dominated the New York Giants 34–7 to win the franchise&#x27;s first ever Super Bowl championship. Lewis&#x27;s five combined tackles and four passes defended earned him Super Bowl XXXV MVP honors. He also added 31 tackles, two interceptions, 9 pass deflections, one fumble recovery, and a touchdown in the four-game playoff run.

=== 2001 season ===

In 2001, Lewis earned his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl selection, when he led the NFL in tackles with 162 and earned first-team All-Pro honors. In week 12, he had a career-high 18 total tackles and one sack in the 39–27 victory over the Colts. In week 15, he earned his third AFC Defensive Player of the Week honor in a 15–0 shutout of the Cincinnati Bengals. He had two interceptions and 11 total tackles in the win. The Ravens earned a playoff berth with a 10–6 record. In the Ravens&#x27; two playoff games, he totaled 17 tackles, three forced fumbles, and one pass deflection as the team&#x27;s season ended in the divisional round.

=== 2002 season ===

In 2002, Lewis was limited to only five games due to a shoulder injury. He still managed to rank fifth on the team with 58 tackles. In addition, Lewis compiled two interceptions, two pass deflections, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. Lewis earned AFC Defensive Player of the Week honors in week 4 against the Denver Broncos after posting and tying his career-high with 18 tackles (11 solo), two pass deflections, and an interception. After having been selected to the Pro Bowl for five consecutive seasons (1997–2001), Lewis&#x27;s streak was stopped by his season-ending injury. In his absence, the Baltimore Ravens defense finished ranked 19th in points allowed the team as a whole finished with a 7–9 record.
=== 2003 season: Second Defensive Player of the Year award ===
Lewis was the leading vote recipient for the 2003 AP All-Pro team, earning 49 of 50 votes. He also won the annual AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year with 43 votes out of 50. He was named to his sixth career Pro Bowl for the 2003 season. Additionally, Lewis earned &quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot;, PFWA, and &quot;Football Digest&quot; Defensive MVP honors and was named to Dr. Z&#x27;s &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; All-Pro team, &quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot; All-NFL team, &quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot; All-AFC team, &quot;Football Digest&quot; All-Pro first team, and &quot;The Sporting News&quot;″ All-Pro team.

He also forced a fumble and recovered one. The Ravens allowed just one 100-yard rushing performance in the 14 games Lewis played. Lewis was named AFC Defensive Player of the Week following his seven-tackle, one-sack, and three-pass-deflection performance against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the season opener.

In the three playoff games against the Miami Dolphins, Tennessee Titans, and Pittsburgh Steelers, Lewis totaled 29 tackles, two forced fumbles, and one pass deflection in three games. After the season, he became an unrestricted free agent, but agreed to return to the Baltimore Ravens to complete his career. The contract, which would have run through 2015 (including two option years), was said to be worth $10 million the first year, but was highly incentivized.

=== 2009 season ===

In 2009, Lewis was named first-team All-Pro by the Associated Press for the seventh time (ninth selection overall) and named to his 11th Pro Bowl. He accumulated an AFC-leading 134 tackles on the season. He also added three sacks, two forced fumbles, one fumble recovery, and seven passes deflected. Lewis added 21 tackles, one sack, and one pass deflection in two playoff games. In the September 2009 issue of &quot;Sporting News&#x27; Magazine&quot;, Lewis was selected to their Team of the Decade (2000s). In week 2 against the San Diego Chargers, Lewis made the game-saving tackle on running back Darren Sproles on a fourth-down play.

On Sunday, November 21, 2010, Lewis became only the second player in NFL history to record at least 30 interceptions and 30 sacks for their career. He was the fastest player (204 games) to achieve that feat. He was ranked fourth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011. He earned the highest ranking for a defensive player on the initial ranking by the NFL players.

=== 2011 season ===

In week 3, Lewis was named AFC Defensive Player of the Week for his performance against the St. Louis Rams. In the 37–7 victory, Lewis had one sack, one forced fumble, and ten solo tackles.

=== 2012: Final year and second Super Bowl ===

Lewis suffered torn triceps on October 14, 2012, during a game against the Dallas Cowboys, and had them surgically repaired three days later. Several sources had reported he was expected to return to action December 16 in the game against the Denver Broncos, much earlier than his expected return in January, but he was inactive for the game. On January 2, 2013, Lewis announced he would retire after his team finished the 2012–13 NFL playoffs.

He returned to action for Baltimore&#x27;s Wild Card Round game against the Colts and led the defense to a 24–9 win. On the game&#x27;s last play, Lewis lined up on offense at fullback. The Ravens were not slated to play another home playoff game (since they were the number-four seed, and the day before, the Houston Texans beat the number-six seed Cincinnati Bengals), so they wanted Lewis to be on the field for the final play. Next, the Ravens defeated the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round, 38–35 in double overtime, and then defeated the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship, 28–13.
Lewis&#x27;s final career NFL game was Super Bowl XLVII, where the Ravens defeated the San Francisco 49ers by a score of 34–31. Lewis finished the regular season with 57 tackles, one sack, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery, and one deflection in six games. In the postseason, Lewis led the NFL with 51 tackles. He contributed two tackles for loss and one pass deflection in the Ravens&#x27; Super Bowl XLVII run.

===Playoffs===
==Murder trial==
Following a Super Bowl XXXIV party in Atlanta on January 31, 2000, a fight broke out between Lewis&#x27; entourage and another group of people, resulting in the stabbing deaths of Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar. Lewis and two companions, Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting, were questioned by Atlanta police, and 11 days later the three men were indicted on murder and aggravated assault charges. The fight occurred about from the Cobalt Lounge at 265 East Paces Ferry Road in the Buckhead Village neighborhood about two miles north of downtown Atlanta where Lewis had been celebrating.
The white suit Lewis was wearing the night of the killings was never found. Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard alleged the blood-stained suit was dumped in a garbage bin outside a fast food restaurant. A knife found at the scene did not have any fingerprints or DNA. Lewis subsequently testified that Oakley and Sweeting had bought knives earlier in the week before the Super Bowl from a Sports Authority where Lewis had been signing autographs. Baker&#x27;s blood was found inside of Lewis&#x27;s limousine.

Two weeks into the trial, Lewis&#x27;s attorneys, Don Samuel and Ed Garland, negotiated a plea agreement with the District Attorney in which the murder charges against Lewis were dismissed in exchange for his testimony against Oakley and Sweeting, and his guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of justice. Lewis admitted he gave a misleading statement to police on the morning after the killings (initially telling them that he was not at the scene). Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner sentenced Lewis to 12 months&#x27; probation. One year in prison is the maximum sentence for a first-time offender, and the immediate probation was the judge&#x27;s decision. He was also fined $250,000 by the NFL, which was believed to be the highest fine levied against an NFL player for an infraction not involving substance abuse. Under the terms of the sentence, Lewis could not use drugs or alcohol during the duration of the probation.

===Outcome===
Oakley and Sweeting maintained that they had acted in self-defense, and after five hours of deliberation, the jury acquitted them of all charges in June 2000. The following year, Lewis was named Super Bowl XXXV MVP. However, the signature phrase &quot;I&#x27;m going to Disney World!&quot; was given instead to quarterback Trent Dilfer.

On April 29, 2004, Lewis reached an out-of-court settlement with four-year-old India Lollar, born months after the death of her father Richard, pre-empting a scheduled civil proceeding. Lewis also reached an undisclosed settlement with Baker&#x27;s family.

During a taped pre-game interview with Shannon Sharpe that aired on CBS before Super Bowl XLVII, Sharpe told Lewis that the families of the slain men find it difficult to see Lewis idolized by millions of fans, believing he knows more about the killings than he shared, and asked what he had to say to those families. Lewis responded, &quot;God has never made a mistake. That&#x27;s just who He is, you see... To the family, if you knew, if you really knew the way God works, He don&#x27;t use people who commits anything like that for His glory.&quot;

The Ravens&#x27; crisis management around Lewis&#x27;s murder trial was revisited by former head coach Brian Billick, by then a media analyst, after the 2013 arrest of Aaron Hernandez and his swift release by the New England Patriots.

==Legacy==

Throughout his career, Lewis built a reputation as a leader and intimidating force at middle linebacker. He has led his team in tackles in 12 of his 14 seasons. The Ravens did not allow a single 100-yard rusher in 51 consecutive games from the 1998 through 2001 seasons. In addition to his run defense, Lewis has also gained a reputation as a complete defender. His 31 interceptions rank fifth all-time among NFL linebackers, and just six short of the top spot. Since the murder allegations, Lewis&#x27;s image has recovered, and today he is considered one of the most dominant linebackers in the history of the NFL. Lewis was also selected as the third-best linebacker of all time on the show &quot;The Sports List&quot;. A poll of NFL coaches selected him as the most dominant player in the NFL before the 2003 season by being mentioned on 10 ballots, while no other player was mentioned more than twice. Team owner Steve Bisciotti stated his intention to erect a statue of Lewis outside M&amp;T Bank Stadium. On September 4, 2014, days before the Ravens season opener, a statue of Lewis was unveiled in front of M&amp;T Bank Stadium.

Lewis has been referenced in television shows such as &quot;The Wire&quot;, films such as &quot;The Rundown&quot; (by that movie&#x27;s star and Lewis&#x27;s friend &amp; former teammate at Miami, Dwayne Johnson), and in music videos, such as in Mario&#x27;s &quot;Just a Friend 2002&quot; and Nelly&#x27;s &quot;Heart of a Champion&quot;. Lewis has appeared in television ads for NFL Network, Reebok, Under Armour, Old Spice, and Eastern Motors. He was the featured athlete on the cover of &quot;Madden NFL 2005&quot;. That season, he missed a number of games to an injury, adding to the &quot;Madden Curse&quot;. He was documented in NFL Network&#x27;s documentary series &quot;A Football Life&quot;. He was named to the NFL 100 All Time Team.

==Other work==
Lewis opened the Ray Lewis Full Moon Bar-B-Que, which operated in Baltimore&#x27;s Canton neighborhood from February 2005 until 2008. He has also gained several national corporate endorsements, some of which draw upon his tough image. In 2004, Lewis was placed on the cover of the highly popular &quot;Madden NFL 2005&quot; video game published by EA Sports, and is also a very avid player of the same series. In 2006, it was announced that Lewis, Hall of Fame running back Gale Sayers, and entrepreneur Mark Bloomquist would form S&amp;L Racing, intending to race both cars and trucks from a North Carolina headquarters. Lewis&#x27;s attempt to join NASCAR racing failed.

On March 13, 2013, it was announced that Lewis would join ESPN as a contributor for their NFL coverage. Lewis was let go by ESPN in 2016. On June 20, 2017, it was announced Lewis had been hired by cable sports network Fox Sports 1.

Lewis competed against tight end Tony Gonzalez in an episode of Spike (now Paramount Network)&#x27;s &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot;, which aired on February 2, 2017. He emerged victorious with performances of Al Green&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; and &quot;Hot in Herre&quot; by Nelly, who joined him for the performance.

In August 2019, Lewis was announced as one of the celebrities to compete on season 28 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He later withdrew from the competition due to a tendon injury in his foot, requiring surgery.

==Charitable activities==
Lewis has been heavily involved in charitable activities throughout his professional career. He started the Ray Lewis 52 Foundation which is a nonprofit corporation whose mission is to provide personal and economic assistance to disadvantaged youth. The foundation has funded such events as adopting 10 families in Baltimore community for the holidays, an annual celebrity auction and bowling tournament, the Great Maryland Duck Derby, Thanksgiving food drives on North Avenue in Baltimore, and Ray&#x27;s Summer Days. All proceeds have helped fund the Ray Lewis Foundation.

Lewis has since been involved in pressing political, business, and philanthropic leaders for a stronger commitment to disability sports both here and in the developing world. Lewis was also honored with a JB award (named in honor of CBS broadcaster James Brown) during the 2006 off-season and received the &quot;Act of Kindness&quot; Award for his work in the community.

==Awards and accolades==
Since his rookie year in 1996, Lewis has won numerous NFL awards, including being named Defensive Player of the Year twice (2000 and 2003), as well as Super Bowl MVP after winning Super Bowl XXXV after the 2000 season. He is also a 13-time Pro Bowler and seven-time AP First Team All-Pro player, a three-time AP Second Team All-Pro Selection, and was also a two-time All-American in college (1994 and 1995).

In 2003, Lewis led all linebackers with six interceptions, a total matching the post-merger all-time record for a middle linebacker in a single season. Lewis was named first-team Associated Press All-Pro in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009 and second-team All-Pro in 1997, 1998, and 2010. His 10 total All-Pro selections is a record for an inside/middle linebacker and ties the record for a linebacker (Lawrence Taylor also has 10 selections). In 21 career playoff games, Lewis has totaled 214 tackles (135 solo), two sacks, six forced fumbles, one fumble recovery, two interceptions for 54 yards, 15 pass deflections, 10.5 stuffs for a loss, and one touchdown.

Lewis was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018, his first year of eligibility. Lewis joined teammate Jonathan Ogden in Canton; the two were the Ravens&#x27; first two draft picks after the team relocated to Baltimore.

<text>Roberts Wesleyan University is a private Christian university in suburban Rochester, New York, anchored in the liberal arts. It was the first educational institution established for Free Methodists in North America. Roberts is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. In the fall of 2023, Roberts Wesleyan enrolled 1621 students in undergraduate, graduate, adult degree completion and doctoral programs. It offers over 100 programs.

==History==

Roberts Wesleyan University was originally established as &quot;Chili Seminary&quot; by Benjamin Titus Roberts in 1866. Roberts was a social activist who opposed slavery and oppression of the poor, and was a supporter of women&#x27;s right to vote. He began the school to train young people to become servant leaders with high moral character. Having first used a local tavern as a school, in 1869 a three-story brick building was erected. There were 56 students total that year.

In 1885, its name changed to &quot;Chesbrough Seminary&quot; in response to the $30,000 gift of benefactor A.M. Chesbrough.
In the fall of 1892 both Cox Hall and Roberts Hall were completed. Cox Hall was used as both class rooms and administration, and now houses the Department of Music and Performing Arts. The first public event held in Cox Hall was founder B.T. Roberts&#x27; funeral in 1893. Students laid a sidewalk between Cox and Roberts Hall in 1929.

Carpenter Hall was opened in 1935. It was named for Adella P. Carpenter who had taught at the school from 1877 to 1916. Carpenter Hall has housed many important pieces of the campus, including the dining hall, library, and dorms. The building currently houses the Art, Social Work, and Psychology Departments.

In 1945, it was renamed &quot;Roberts Junior College&quot; in honor of B.T. Roberts, the founder of both the college and the Free Methodist Church. Four years later, it was renamed as &quot;Roberts Wesleyan College&quot; to indicate the transition to a four-year baccalaureate institution and to root itself clearly within the Wesleyan theological tradition.

In 1998, Northeastern Seminary was established as Roberts&#x27; graduate school of theology.

On September 13, 2022, it was renamed &quot;Roberts Wesleyan University&quot; after applying to the New York State Education Department and the Board of Regents.

The 12th president of Roberts Wesleyan University is Rupert A. Hayles Jr., who started on July 1, 2023.

==Athletics==

The Roberts Wesleyan athletic teams are called the Redhawks. Roberts is a member of the NCAA Division II ranks, primarily competing in the East Coast Conference (ECC) since the 2012–13 academic year. They are also a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA), primarily competing as an independent in the Midwest Region at the Division I level. The Redhawks previously competed in the defunct American Mideast Conference of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 2001–02 to 2011–12 (when the conference dissolved).

Roberts Wesleyan competes in 19 intercollegiate varsity sports. Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, volleyball and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor); women&#x27;s sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball. Four sports were added in 2023–24: women&#x27;s field hockey and triathlon, men&#x27;s volleyball, and the coeducational and non-NCAA esports.

===Move to Division II===
In July 2011, Roberts was accepted into the NCAA Division II reclassification process from the NAIA to the NCAA. Roberts became a full member of NCAA Division II for the 2014–15 academic year. Roberts Wesleyan University is the first NCAA Division II school in the Greater Rochester Region.

<doc id="449988" wikidata="Q5633432" url="?curid=449988" title="HMS Montrose (F236)">
<text>HMS &quot;Montrose&quot; was the eighth of the sixteen-ship Type 23 or Duke class of frigates, of the Royal Navy, named after the Duke of Montrose. She was laid down in November 1989 by Yarrow Shipbuilders on the Clyde, and was launched on 31 July 1992 by Edith Rifkind (later Lady Rifkind), wife of (later Sir) Malcolm Rifkind, Secretary of State for Defence. She was commissioned into service in June 1994.

Having once been the flagship of the 6th Frigate Squadron, &quot;Montrose&quot; became part of the Devonport Flotilla, based in Devonport Dockyard in Plymouth. In 2018, it was announced that &quot;Montrose&quot; would become the first Royal Navy frigate to be forward-deployed to the UK Naval Support Facility in Bahrain. The 2021 defence review announced that the ship would now be retired early, likely after her return to the U.K. from the Persian Gulf. She was deployed on maritime security operations in the Persian Gulf up to November 2022.
On 5 January 2022 the frigate passed the 1,000-day milestone of days at sea and in November of that year departed the Persian Gulf to return to the U.K. ahead of her planned decommissioning, expected in spring 2023. She was subsequently decommissioned on 17 April 2023.

==Operational history==

===1994–2000===
Deployments in the 1990s include her first trip to the South Atlantic, as Falkland Islands guardship, which ended in October 1996. Her first visit to the City of Dundee was in 1993. Several NATO deployments followed.

===2001–2010===
In early 2002, &quot;Montrose&quot; returned to the Falklands on the now-renamed Atlantic Patrol Task (South) deployment, during which divers from &quot;Montrose&quot; replaced the White Ensign on , which was sunk during the Falklands War. On her return from this deployment, she conducted her first refit period (RP1), which was completed in early January 2004.

In October 2004, &quot;Montrose&quot; was one of a number of ships dispatched to the rescue of the stricken Canadian submarine (an ex-Royal Navy &quot;Upholder&quot;-class submarine) which had suffered a number of fires on board, causing casualties and the loss of power in the submarine. &quot;Montrose&quot; was the first Royal Navy vessel to make contact with the boat and assisted the submarine.

&quot;Montrose&quot; deployed in 2006 to the Persian Gulf on Operation Telic in the first half of 2006. After returning to the UK for personnel changes and maintenance, from 8 January to 27 July 2007, &quot;Montrose&quot; then deployed for seven months to the Mediterranean Sea as the UK contribution to the Standing NATO Maritime Group Two (SNMG2). As part of this group, she participated in NATO&#x27;s Operation Active Endeavour (OAE), countering terrorist activity in the Mediterranean and preventing smuggling and other illegal activity. After Summer Leave, the ship headed to Scotland to take part in Exercise Neptune Warrior, and was visited there by Prince Michael of Kent, Honorary Rear Admiral of the Royal Naval Reserve, on 24 September 2007.

Following Operational Sea Training, &quot;Montrose&quot; deployed again to the Middle East on 12 March 2008 to join Combined Task Force (CTF) 150, operating in the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. Activity in this deployment included Exercise Khunjar Haad, a multi-national exercise held in the Gulf of Oman in May, and working with , and the seizure of over 23 tonnes of illegal drugs including cocaine, hashish, amphetamines and opiates. She returned home on 3 October 2008, and after operating in UK waters, commenced a £15,000,000 upkeep package at Rosyth in early 2009.

This second refit package (RP2) included a number of major capability upgrades for the ship, including the first fitting of the Royal Navy&#x27;s newest command system, DNA(2), and the replacement of the two old manually-operated 30 mm guns with two 30 mm DS30M Mark 2 Guns. Having rejoined the ship on 20 July 2009, the crew conducted post-refits trials until January 2010, and &quot;Montrose&quot; was formally accepted back into the fleet on 11 February 2010.

After operational sea training &quot;Montrose&quot; deployed to the Arabian Sea in Summer 2010 to conduct anti-piracy operations, highlights of which included the November 2010 destruction of a Somalian pirate ship by the ship&#x27;s Lynx helicopter while on patrol off the coast of Somalia, and the disruption of several pirate attacks on merchant ships.

===2011–2023===
In October 2011, &quot;Montrose&quot; deployed again to the South Atlantic, during which she was due to visit Callao, Peru in March 2012, but the Peruvian government cancelled the visit, according to the Foreign Minister, as a gesture of solidarity with Argentina over the Falklands. After visits to New Orleans and Bermuda in March and April 2012, &quot;Montrose&quot; returned to the UK in May 2012. In July 2012, the ship acted as the escort vessel for Queen Elizabeth II during her Diamond Jubilee visit to Cowes.

From September to November 2012, the ship participated in the COUGAR 12 deployment to the Mediterranean. In early 2013, the ship and crew underwent intensive training to return to the front line, and then deployed as part of the COUGAR 13 task group in August 2013. After the remainder of the COUGAR 13 task group returned to the UK, &quot;Montrose&quot; remained in the Middle East to act as the UK&#x27;s frigate in the Persian Gulf under Operation KIPION, and conducted numerous exercises with allied nations, as well as UK-only training events such as the maintenance exercise with .

In 2014, &quot;Montrose&quot; was tasked to join Norwegian and Danish warships in Operation RECSYR – the mission to escort the merchant vessels removing the Syrian chemical weapons stockpile for destruction. Having handed over to , the ship arrived home in March 2014. Subsequently, and after a high-profile London visit to celebrate 20 years since the ship&#x27;s commissioning, the ship was sent to the Baltic Sea to participate in BALTOPS 14, a large scale US-led multinational exercise with participation from 30 ships and submarines from 14 nations.

The ship entered refit at Devonport in October 2014, was due to rejoin the Fleet in 2016, but the incomplete installation of the Sea Ceptor Missile system and a new command system prevented
it. Ship&#x27;s staff moved back on board in March 2017 to prepare for sea trials and it was announced that &quot;Montrose&quot; would escort on her deployment to the United States for first of class flying trials in 2018. &quot;Montrose&quot; returned to sea for the first time in nearly three years on 7 July 2017 to commence a period of trials and testing before undergoing operational sea training later in the year. Despite the announcement in 2017, &quot;Montrose&quot; did not accompany &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; on her 2018 deployment; escort duties instead fell to sister HMS &quot;Monmouth&quot;. &quot;Montrose&quot; instead began working up for a major three-year deployment, which would see the ship become the first frigate to be based at the Royal Navy&#x27;s new support facility in Bahrain, .

In mid 2018 &quot;Montrose&quot; acted as the Fleet Readiness Escort (FRE) in the North Sea and Dover Straits, escorting Russian units as they passed through these areas. This was followed by a mini-deployment to the Baltic where she exercised with the Swedish and Finnish navies and to strengthen ties with these nations with a focus around the celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the formation of the Finnish Navy. On return to the UK, &quot;Montrose&quot; went through a period of operational sea training before deploying to the South Pacific and Far East to carry out MarSy Operations in conjunction with JIATF(S) and Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPS). During this time she visited Chile, Easter Island, Pitcairn Island, Tahiti, Auckland, Darwin, Singapore and Tokyo.

During a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe on 10 January 2019, it was announced that HMS &quot;Montrose&quot; would be deployed to the Pacific region to enforce sanctions against North Korea.

&quot;Montrose&quot; forward-deployed to Bahrain in April 2019, where she will remain until 2022 carrying out an array of joint security operations including counter-piracy, counter-narcotics and boarding operations to support allies in the region and to protect the UK&#x27;s interests. In early July 2019, amid rising tensions between the United Kingdom and Iran, &quot;Montrose&quot; issued radio warnings to boats believed to belong to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy which were attempting to impede the passage of the British commercial vessel &quot;British Heritage&quot;. US officials stated that five Iranian boats were involved, while some UK sources say only three were involved. The incident occurred in the Strait of Hormuz. According to some tabloid sources, &quot;Montrose&quot; had her 30 mm deck guns trained on the Iranian boats. &quot;Montrose&quot; was joined by which was ordered to the Persian Gulf on 12 July 2019 in response to threats against British shipping by Iran. On 19 July &quot;Montrose&quot; warned the Islamic Revolutionary Guard by radio against the seizure of the British-flagged but was not close enough to prevent the seizure. In September 2019, &quot;Stena Impero&quot; was released and HMS &quot;Duncan&quot; returned to Portsmouth. On 12 October it was reported that &quot;Montrose&quot; along with her French counterpart, , were able to capture of illegal drugs. These drugs had an estimated worth of $1 million. The ships were able to catch the drug-smuggling dhow while operating in the Arabian Sea.

On 22 March 2021, it was announced that &quot;Montrose&quot; as well as sister ship would be decommissioned earlier than planned as part of defence&#x27;s Integrated Review. As of 2021, &quot;Montrose&quot; remained deployed east of Suez but was scheduled to return to the UK in 2022 following which she was retired, about 4-5 years earlier than previously planned.

On 23 January 2022, the Royal Navy seized of heroin, of methamphetamine, of hashish, and marijuana during a raid from &quot;Montrose&quot;, reportedly worth 15 million British pounds ($20 million).

As of June 2022, the out of service date for &quot;Montrose&quot; was brought forward to early 2023. On 4 November 2022 &quot;Montrose&quot; left United Kingdom Naval Support Facility where she was permanently based since April 2019. She arrived back in U.K. waters in mid-December 2022 and was decommissioned on 17 April 2023.

In 2022, &quot;Montrose&quot; spent 212 days at sea.

==Visits to Dundee and Montrose==
&quot;Montrose&quot; has visited Dundee on many occasions, include Easter 1997, 6–9 November 1998 (Dundee Navy Days), 9 October 2004 (for wreath-laying ceremony commemorating the 200th anniversary of the death of Admiral Adam Duncan), 4 June 2005, and 9–13 November 2006 (covering the Remembrance Sunday memorial service).

The port of Montrose is smaller than Dundee, but &quot;Montrose&quot; has called in six times. The first visit took place in November 1999, followed by five other visits, one in July 2002, when the ship was granted the Freedom of Angus by the Provost Mrs Frances Duncan, and marched through the town, and six years later in November 2008, when Angus Provost Ruth Melville took the salute during a Remembrance Sunday parade in which this Freedom was exercised. The ship returned to Montrose in July 2014, where they exercised the Freedom of Angus in front of Provost Helen Oswald, and conducted numerous engagements in the local area. The ship visited for a fifth time in July 2018, welcoming members of the public on board for a brief tour of the deck. The last visit took place in March 2023 just before her decommissioning. Montrose was decommissioned on 17 April 2023.

==Commanding officers==
As the flagship of the 6th Frigate Squadron (or F6), many of the first commanding officers of HMS &quot;Montrose&quot; were captains, rather than commanders, as they had administrative responsibility over all the Type 23 frigates based in Devonport. The equivalent squadron for the Portsmouth-based Type 23s was the 4th Frigate Squadron. With the abolition of the frigate and destroyer squadrons in 2002/3, and their replacement by flotillas, command of &quot;Montrose&quot; reverted to that of a Commander.

Of this list, three commanding officers were subsequently promoted to vice admiral, including the husband of the Princess Royal, Timothy Laurence, who assumed command of the ship (and the 6th Frigate Squadron) on 27 August 1996.


Ten of the former Commanding Officers were reunited on board &quot;Montrose&quot; on 30 May 2014 at a lunch held to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the ship&#x27;s commissioning, when they were invited on board while the ship was in London; the ship&#x27;s sponsor, Lady Rifkind, also attended.

==Decorations==
At the end of 2014, HMS &quot;Montrose&quot; was awarded the Fleet Effectiveness Trophy for best frigate in the Royal Navy in 2014.

<text>Wausau ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Marathon County, Wisconsin, United States, along the Wisconsin River. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 39,994. It is the core city of the Wausau metropolitan area, which includes all of Marathon County and had a population of 138,013 in 2020. The city&#x27;s suburbs include Schofield, Weston, Mosinee, Maine, Rib Mountain, Kronenwetter, and Rothschild.

==History==

===Establishment and early history===
This area has for millennia changed hands between various indigenous peoples. The historic Ojibwe (also known in the United States as the Chippewa) occupied it in the period of European encounter. They had a lucrative fur trade for decades with French colonists and French Canadians. After the French and Indian War this trade was dominated by British-American trappers from the eastern seaboard.

The Wisconsin River first drew European-American settlers to the area during the mid-19th century as they migrated west into the Great Lakes region following construction of the Erie Canal in New York State. This provided a route for products from the region to the large New York and other eastern markets. The area had been called &quot;Big Bull Flats&quot; or &quot;Big Bull Falls&quot; by French explorers, who were the first Europeans here. They named it for the long rapids in the river, which created many bubbles, called &quot;bulle&quot; in French. By an 1836 treaty with the United States, the Ojibwe ceded much of their lands in the area to federal ownership. It was sold to non-Native peoples. &quot;Wausau&quot;, from Ojibwe “waasa”, means &quot;a faraway place&quot;.

George Stevens, the namesake of the city of Stevens Point south of Wausau, began harvesting the pine forests for lumber in 1840 and built a saw mill. Lumbering was the first major industry in this area, and other sawmills along the Wisconsin River were quickly constructed by entrepreneurs. By 1846, Walter McIndoe arrived and took the lead in the local business and community. His efforts helped to establish Marathon County in 1850. Word of Stevens&#x27;s success in the region spread across the country throughout the logging industry.

By 1852, Wausau had been established as a town and continued to grow and mature. German immigration into the area following the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states brought more people, and by 1861, the settlement was incorporated as a village.

Churches, schools, industry and social organizations began to flourish. The state granted the city a charter in 1872, and elections are held the first Tuesday in April. The residents elected August Kickbusch as their first mayor in 1872. Five years earlier, Kickbusch had returned to his homeland of Germany and brought back with him 702 people, all of whom are believed to have settled in the Wausau area. Kickbusch founded the A. Kickbusch Wholesale Grocery Company, a family business carried on by his grandson, August Kickbusch II. In 1917, August Kickbusch II purchased a modest four-square-style house at 513 Grant Street. He undertook extensive additions, adding two sun rooms, arcaded windows, a tiled porch in the Mediterranean style, a formal classical entrance, and ornate custom-designed chimney crowns. The home is on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Andrew Warren Historic District.

When the railroad arrived in 1874, Wausau became more accessible to settlers and industry. This enabled the city to develop alternatives to the lumber industry, which was in decline since the clear-cutting of many forests. By 1906 the lumber was gone, but the city continued to grow and flourish. Other villages and towns in the area declined because of over-harvesting of the forests and lumber mills closed down.

===20th century to present===
Wausau&#x27;s favorable location on the Wisconsin River was partly responsible for its survival. The economy was diversified in the early 20th century, led by Employers Insurance of Wausau, now a part of Liberty Mutual. Its logo, first introduced in 1954, was the downtown Milwaukee Road railroad depot set against the backdrop of the community&#x27;s skyline.

The Wall Street Crash of 1929 had a major effect on the Wausau area. Many industries were forced to cut back by laying off and dismissing workers or by closing altogether. After decades of growth, the city virtually ground to a halt. But after World War II—Wausau was significantly modernized—and it continued to grow in industry, education, recreation, and retail, more than in population.

After the fall of Saigon, Hmong refugees from Southeast Asia who fought alongside the CIA immigrated to Wausau at the end of the 1970s. Wausau church organizations (Catholic and Lutheran) helped Hmong refugees adapt to American life.

In 1983, the Wausau Center shopping mall opened. By the mid- to late-1990s, the Wausau began to purchase and develop parts of West Industrial Park to meet the needs of the expanding economy and companies. In the late 1990s, the city demolished a number of aging buildings on a square in the center of downtown, creating what is known locally as the 400 Block, an open, grassy block with paved sidewalks crossing it. The square is a focal point for summer festivals. In recent years Wausau has redone the 400 Block, adding a permanent stage and other renovations that cost $2 million.

By the end of the 20th century, Wausau began to implement the Wausau Central Business District Master Plan, which included redevelopment and economic restructuring of downtown Wausau. The tallest commercial building in Wisconsin outside of Milwaukee is in Wausau: the 241-foot Dudley tower.

Churches and social service agencies settled refugees, most of them Hmong with some Vietnamese and Lao, in Wausau after the Vietnam War. According to the 1980 U.S. Census, the Wausau SMSA had fewer than 1% non-White people. There were several dozen immigrants in 1978. By 1980 Wausau had 200 immigrants. This increased to 400 in 1982 and 800 in 1984.

In 1981 there were 160 Hmong students in the Wausau School District and in 1991 1,010. In a period ending in 1994 the tax rate of the Wausau School District rose by 10.48% as a result of the expenses of services to children from immigrant families. The increase was three times as high as the increase in an adjacent school district without a large immigrant population. By 1994 Wausau had 4,200 refugees. By 1996 the number of Hmong students in the school district was over 2,000. In 1998 this number reached its peak, 2,214. The city experienced some social upheaval following the Hmong arrival. Some schools in Wausau had a minority of English speakers and some were predominantly Hmong students. Some native-born American families in Wausau criticized the crime and expenses in social services.

Per the 2022 American Community Survey five-year estimates, the Hmong population was 3,885 comprising over 80% of the city&#x27;s Asian population.

As of 2003, &quot;Sixty percent of Hmong families are homeowners. Although more than half of the workforce is earning less than $8 an hour, the welfare rate has dropped to less than 5 percent. More people are going to college. And test scores and graduation rates of Hmong public school students are steadily rising.&quot;

In Wausau there is relatively little Hmong-language media because, for much of its history, the Hmong language was not written.

<text>In mathematics, the Jacobi elliptic functions are a set of basic elliptic functions. They are found in the description of the motion of a pendulum, as well as in the design of electronic elliptic filters. While trigonometric functions are defined with reference to a circle, the Jacobi elliptic functions are a generalization which refer to other conic sections, the ellipse in particular. The relation to trigonometric functions is contained in the notation, for example, by the matching notation formula_1 for formula_2. The Jacobi elliptic functions are used more often in practical problems than the Weierstrass elliptic functions as they do not require notions of complex analysis to be defined and/or understood. They were introduced by . Carl Friedrich Gauss had already studied special Jacobi elliptic functions in 1797, the lemniscate elliptic functions in particular, but his work was published much later.

==Overview==
There are twelve Jacobi elliptic functions denoted by formula_3, where formula_4 and formula_5 are any of the letters formula_6, formula_7, formula_8, and formula_9. (Functions of the form formula_10 are trivially set to unity for notational completeness.) formula_11 is the argument, and formula_12 is the parameter, both of which may be complex. In fact, the Jacobi elliptic functions are meromorphic in both formula_11 and formula_12. The distribution of the zeros and poles in the formula_11-plane is well-known. However, questions of the distribution of the zeros and poles in the formula_12-plane remain to be investigated.

In the complex plane of the argument formula_11, the twelve functions form a repeating lattice of simple poles and zeroes. Depending on the function, one repeating parallelogram, or unit cell, will have sides of length formula_18 or formula_19 on the real axis, and formula_20 or formula_21 on the imaginary axis, where formula_22 and formula_23 are known as the quarter periods with formula_24 being the elliptic integral of the first kind. The nature of the unit cell can be determined by inspecting the &quot;auxiliary rectangle&quot; (generally a parallelogram), which is a rectangle formed by the origin formula_25 at one corner, and formula_26 as the diagonally opposite corner. As in the diagram, the four corners of the auxiliary rectangle are named formula_7, formula_6, formula_9, and formula_8, going counter-clockwise from the origin. The function formula_31 will have a zero at the formula_4 corner and a pole at the formula_5 corner. The twelve functions correspond to the twelve ways of arranging these poles and zeroes in the corners of the rectangle.

When the argument formula_11 and parameter formula_12 are real, with formula_36, formula_37 and formula_38 will be real and the auxiliary parallelogram will in fact be a rectangle, and the Jacobi elliptic functions will all be real valued on the real line.

Since the Jacobian elliptic functions are doubly periodic in formula_11, they factor through a torus – in effect, their domain can be taken to be a torus, just as cosine and sine are in effect defined on a circle. Instead of having only one circle, we now have the product of two circles, one real and the other imaginary. The complex plane can be replaced by a complex torus. The circumference of the first circle is formula_19 and the second formula_21, where formula_37 and formula_38 are the quarter periods. Each function has two zeroes and two poles at opposite positions on the torus. Among the points there is one zero and one pole.

The Jacobian elliptic functions are then doubly periodic, meromorphic functions satisfying the following properties:
* There is a simple zero at the corner formula_4, and a simple pole at the corner formula_5.
* The complex number formula_46 is equal to half the period of the function formula_47; that is, the function formula_47 is periodic in the direction formula_49, with the period being formula_50. The function formula_47 is also periodic in the other two directions formula_52 and formula_53, with periods such that formula_54 and formula_55 are quarter periods.


==Notation==

The elliptic functions can be given in a variety of notations, which can make the subject unnecessarily confusing. Elliptic functions are functions of two variables. The first variable might be given in terms of the amplitude formula_56, or more commonly, in terms of formula_11 given below. The second variable might be given in terms of the parameter formula_12, or as the elliptic modulus formula_59, where formula_60, or in terms of the modular angle formula_61, where formula_62. The complements of formula_59 and formula_12 are defined as formula_65 and formula_66. These four terms are used below without comment to simplify various expressions.

The twelve Jacobi elliptic functions are generally written as formula_3 where formula_4 and formula_5 are any of the letters formula_6, formula_7, formula_8, and formula_9. Functions of the form formula_10 are trivially set to unity for notational completeness. The “major” functions are generally taken to be formula_75, formula_76 and formula_77 from which all other functions can be derived and expressions are often written solely in terms of these three functions, however, various symmetries and generalizations are often most conveniently expressed using the full set. (This notation is due to Gudermann and Glaisher and is not Jacobi&#x27;s original notation.)

Throughout this article, formula_78.

The functions are notationally related to each other by the multiplication rule: (arguments suppressed)

:formula_79

from which other commonly used relationships can be derived:

:formula_80
:formula_81
:formula_82

The multiplication rule follows immediately from the identification of the elliptic functions with the Neville theta functions

:formula_83
Also note that:

: formula_84

==Definition in terms of inverses of elliptic integrals==

There is a definition, relating the elliptic functions to the inverse of the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind formula_85. These functions take the parameters formula_11 and formula_12 as inputs. The formula_56 that satisfies

:formula_89

is called the Jacobi amplitude:

:formula_90

In this framework, the &quot;elliptic sine&quot; sn &quot;u&quot; (Latin: &quot;sinus amplitudinis&quot;) is given by

:formula_91

and the &quot;elliptic cosine&quot; cn &quot;u&quot; (Latin: &quot;cosinus amplitudinis&quot;) is given by

:formula_92

and the &quot;delta amplitude&quot; dn &quot;u&quot; (Latin: &quot;delta amplitudinis&quot;)

:formula_93
In the above, the value formula_12 is a free parameter, usually taken to be real such that formula_95 (but can be complex in general), and so the elliptic functions can be thought of as being given by two variables, formula_11 and the parameter formula_12. The remaining nine elliptic functions are easily built from the above three (formula_1, formula_99, formula_100), and are given in a section below. Note that when formula_101, that formula_11 then equals the quarter period formula_37.

In the most general setting, formula_104 is a multivalued function (in formula_11) with infinitely many logarithmic branch points (the branches differ by integer multiples of formula_106), namely the points formula_107 and formula_108 where formula_109. This multivalued function can be made single-valued by cutting the complex plane along the line segments joining these branch points (the cutting can be done in non-equivalent ways, giving non-equivalent single-valued functions), thus making formula_104 analytic everywhere except on the branch cuts. In contrast, formula_111 and other elliptic functions have no branch points, give consistent values for every branch of formula_112, and are meromorphic in the whole complex plane. Since every elliptic function is meromorphic in the whole complex plane (by definition), formula_104 (when considered as a single-valued function) is not an elliptic function.

However, a particular cutting for formula_104 can be made in the formula_11-plane by line segments from formula_116 to formula_108 with formula_109; then it only remains to define formula_104 at the branch cuts by continuity from some direction. Then formula_104 becomes single-valued and singly-periodic in formula_11 with the minimal period formula_122 and it has singularities at the logarithmic branch points mentioned above. If formula_123 and formula_124, formula_104 is continuous in formula_11 on the real line. When formula_127, the branch cuts of formula_104 in the formula_11-plane cross the real line at formula_130 for formula_131; therefore for formula_127, formula_104 is not continuous in formula_11 on the real line and jumps by formula_106 on the discontinuities.

But defining formula_104 this way gives rise to very complicated branch cuts in the formula_12-plane (&quot;not&quot; the formula_11-plane); they have not been fully described as of yet.

Let
:formula_139
be the incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind with parameter formula_12.

Then the Jacobi epsilon function can be defined as
:formula_141
for formula_142 and formula_143 and by analytic continuation in each of the variables otherwise: the Jacobi epsilon function is meromorphic in the whole complex plane (in both formula_11 and formula_12). Alternatively, throughout both the formula_11-plane and formula_12-plane,
:formula_148
formula_149 is well-defined in this way because all residues of formula_150 are zero, so the integral is path-independent. So the Jacobi epsilon relates the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind to the incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind:
:formula_151
The Jacobi epsilon function is not an elliptic function, but it appears when differentiating the Jacobi elliptic functions with respect to the parameter.

The Jacobi zn function is defined by
:formula_152
It is a singly periodic function which is meromorphic in formula_11, but not in formula_12 (due to the branch cuts of formula_155 and formula_37). Its minimal period in formula_11 is formula_158. It is related to the Jacobi zeta function by formula_159

Historically, the Jacobi elliptic functions were first defined by using the amplitude. In more modern texts on elliptic functions, the Jacobi elliptic functions are defined by other means, for example by ratios of theta functions (see below), and the amplitude is ignored.

In modern terms, the relation to elliptic integrals would be expressed by formula_160 (or formula_161) instead of formula_162.

==Definition as trigonometry: the Jacobi ellipse==
formula_163 are defined on the unit circle, with radius &quot;r&quot; = 1 and angle formula_164 arc length of the unit circle measured from the positive &quot;x&quot;-axis. Similarly, Jacobi elliptic functions are defined on the unit ellipse, with &quot;a&quot; = 1. Let

:formula_165

then:

:formula_166

For each angle formula_56 the parameter
:formula_168
(the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind) is computed. 
On the unit circle (formula_169), formula_11 would be an arc length.
However, the relation of formula_11 to the arc length of an ellipse is more complicated.

Let formula_172 be a point on the ellipse, and let formula_173 be the point where the unit circle intersects the line between formula_174 and the origin formula_175.
Then the familiar relations from the unit circle: 
:formula_176
read for the ellipse:
:formula_177
So the projections of the intersection point formula_178 of the line formula_179 with the unit circle on the &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-axes are simply formula_75 and formula_76. These projections may be interpreted as &#x27;definition as trigonometry&#x27;. In short:

:formula_182

For the formula_183 and formula_184 value of the point formula_174 with 
formula_11 and parameter formula_12 we get, after inserting the relation:
:formula_188
into: formula_189 that:
:formula_190
The latter relations for the &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-coordinates of points on the unit ellipse may be considered as generalization of the relations formula_191 for the coordinates of points on the unit circle.

The following table summarizes the expressions for all Jacobi elliptic functions pq(u,m) in the variables (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;r&quot;) and (&quot;φ&quot;,dn) with formula_192
==Definition in terms of the Jacobi theta functions==
===Using elliptic integrals===
Equivalently, Jacobi&#x27;s elliptic functions can be defined in terms of the theta functions. With formula_193 such that formula_194, let

:formula_195
:formula_196
:formula_197
:formula_198
and formula_199, formula_200, formula_201. Then with formula_22, formula_23, formula_204 and formula_205,

:formula_206

The Jacobi zn function can be expressed by theta functions as well:
:formula_207
where formula_208 denotes the partial derivative with respect to the first variable.

===Using modular inversion===
In fact, the definition of the Jacobi elliptic functions in Whittaker &amp; Watson is stated a little bit differently than the one given above (but it&#x27;s equivalent to it) and relies on modular inversion: The function formula_209, defined by

:formula_210
assumes every value in formula_211 &quot;once and only once&quot; in
:formula_212
where formula_213 is the upper half-plane in the complex plane, formula_214 is the boundary of formula_215 and
:formula_216
In this way, each formula_217 can be associated with &quot;one and only one&quot; formula_218. Then Whittaker &amp; Watson define the Jacobi elliptic functions by
:formula_219
where formula_220.
In the book, they place an additional restriction on formula_12 (that formula_222), but it is in fact not a necessary restriction (see the Cox reference). Also, if formula_223 or formula_224, the Jacobi elliptic functions degenerate to non-elliptic functions which is described below.

==Definition in terms of Neville theta functions==

The Jacobi elliptic functions can be defined very simply using the Neville theta functions:

:formula_83

Simplifications of complicated products of the Jacobi elliptic functions are often made easier using these identities.

== Jacobi transformations==

===The Jacobi imaginary transformations===

The Jacobi imaginary transformations relate various functions of the imaginary variable &quot;i u&quot; or, equivalently, relations between various values of the &quot;m&quot; parameter. In terms of the major functions:

:formula_226
:formula_227
:formula_228

Using the multiplication rule, all other functions may be expressed in terms of the above three. The transformations may be generally written as formula_229. The following table gives the formula_230 for the specified pq(&quot;u,m&quot;). (The arguments formula_231 are suppressed)

Since the hyperbolic trigonometric functions are proportional to the circular trigonometric functions with imaginary arguments, it follows that the Jacobi functions will yield the hyperbolic functions for m=1. In the figure, the Jacobi curve has degenerated to two vertical lines at &quot;x&quot; = 1 and &quot;x&quot; = −1.

=== The Jacobi real transformations ===

The Jacobi real transformations yield expressions for the elliptic functions in terms with alternate values of &quot;m&quot;. The transformations may be generally written as formula_232. The following table gives the formula_233 for the specified pq(&quot;u,m&quot;). (The arguments formula_234 are suppressed)

=== Other Jacobi transformations ===

Jacobi&#x27;s real and imaginary transformations can be combined in various ways to yield three more simple transformations
. The real and imaginary transformations are two transformations in a group (D3 or anharmonic group) of six transformations. If

:formula_235

is the transformation for the &quot;m&quot; parameter in the real transformation, and

:formula_236

is the transformation of &quot;m&quot; in the imaginary transformation, then the other transformations can be built up by successive application of these two basic transformations, yielding only three more possibilities:

:formula_237

These five transformations, along with the identity transformation (&quot;μ&quot;&quot;U&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) = &quot;m&quot;) yield the six-element group. With regard to the Jacobi elliptic functions, the general transformation can be expressed using just three functions:

:formula_238
:formula_239
:formula_240

where &quot;i&quot; = U, I, IR, R, RI, or RIR, identifying the transformation, γi is a multiplication factor common to these three functions, and the prime indicates the transformed function. The other nine transformed functions can be built up from the above three. The reason the cs, ns, ds functions were chosen to represent the transformation is that the other functions will be ratios of these three (except for their inverses) and the multiplication factors will cancel.

The following table lists the multiplication factors for the three ps functions, the transformed &quot;m&quot;″s, and the transformed function names for each of the six transformations. (As usual, &quot;k&quot;2 = &quot;m&quot;, 1 − &quot;k&quot;2 = &quot;k&quot;12 = &quot;m&quot;′ and the arguments (formula_241) are suppressed)

Thus, for example, we may build the following table for the RIR transformation. The transformation is generally written formula_242 (The arguments formula_243 are suppressed)

The value of the Jacobi transformations is that any set of Jacobi elliptic functions with any real-valued parameter &quot;m&quot; can be converted into another set for which formula_244 and, for real values of &quot;u&quot;, the function values will be real.

===Amplitude transformations===

In the following, the second variable is suppressed and is equal to formula_12:

:formula_246
:formula_247
where both identities are valid for all formula_248 such that both sides are well-defined.

With

:formula_249

we have

:formula_250
:formula_251
:formula_252

where all the identities are valid for all formula_253 such that both sides are well-defined.

==The Jacobi hyperbola==
Introducing complex numbers, our ellipse has an associated hyperbola:

:formula_254 
from applying Jacobi&#x27;s imaginary transformation to the elliptic functions in the above equation for &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

:formula_255

It follows that we can put formula_256. So our ellipse has a dual ellipse with m replaced by 1-m. This leads to the complex torus mentioned in the Introduction. Generally, m may be a complex number, but when m is real and m&lt;0, the curve is an ellipse with major axis in the x direction. At m=0 the curve is a circle, and for 0&lt;m&lt;1, the curve is an ellipse with major axis in the y direction. At &quot;m&quot; = 1, the curve degenerates into two vertical lines at &quot;x&quot; = ±1. For &quot;m&quot; &gt; 1, the curve is a hyperbola. When &quot;m&quot; is complex but not real, &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y&quot; or both are complex and the curve cannot be described on a real &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot; diagram.

==Minor functions==

Reversing the order of the two letters of the function name results in the reciprocals of the three functions above:

:formula_257

Similarly, the ratios of the three primary functions correspond to the first letter of the numerator followed by the first letter of the denominator:

:formula_258
More compactly, we have

:formula_259

where p and q are any of the letters s, c, d.

== Periodicity, poles, and residues ==

In the complex plane of the argument &quot;u&quot;, the Jacobi elliptic functions form a repeating pattern of poles (and zeroes). The residues of the poles all have the same absolute value, differing only in sign. Each function pq(&quot;u&quot;,&quot;m&quot;) has an &quot;inverse function&quot; (in the multiplicative sense) qp(&quot;u&quot;,&quot;m&quot;) in which the positions of the poles and zeroes are exchanged. The periods of repetition are generally different in the real and imaginary directions, hence the use of the term &quot;doubly periodic&quot; to describe them.

For the Jacobi amplitude and the Jacobi epsilon function:
:formula_260
:formula_261
:formula_262
:formula_263
where formula_264 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind with parameter formula_12.

The double periodicity of the Jacobi elliptic functions may be expressed as:

:formula_266

where &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; are any pair of integers. &quot;K&quot;(⋅) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, also known as the quarter period. The power of negative unity (&quot;γ&quot;) is given in the following table:

When the factor (−1)&quot;γ&quot; is equal to −1, the equation expresses quasi-periodicity. When it is equal to unity, it expresses full periodicity. It can be seen, for example, that for the entries containing only α when α is even, full periodicity is expressed by the above equation, and the function has full periods of 4&quot;K&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) and 2&quot;iK&quot;(1 − &quot;m&quot;). Likewise, functions with entries containing only &quot;β&quot; have full periods of 2K(m) and 4&quot;iK&quot;(1 − &quot;m&quot;), while those with α + β have full periods of 4&quot;K&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) and 4&quot;iK&quot;(1 − &quot;m&quot;).

In the diagram on the right, which plots one repeating unit for each function, indicating phase along with the location of poles and zeroes, a number of regularities can be noted: The inverse of each function is opposite the diagonal, and has the same size unit cell, with poles and zeroes exchanged. The pole and zero arrangement in the auxiliary rectangle formed by (0,0), (&quot;K&quot;,0), (0,&quot;K&quot;′) and (&quot;K&quot;,&quot;K&quot;′) are in accordance with the description of the pole and zero placement described in the introduction above. Also, the size of the white ovals indicating poles are a rough measure of the absolute value of the residue for that pole. The residues of the poles closest to the origin in the figure (i.e. in the auxiliary rectangle) are listed in the following table:

When applicable, poles displaced above by 2&quot;K&quot; or displaced to the right by 2&quot;K&quot;′ have the same value but with signs reversed, while those diagonally opposite have the same value. Note that poles and zeroes on the left and lower edges are considered part of the unit cell, while those on the upper and right edges are not.

The information about poles can in fact be used to characterize the Jacobi elliptic functions:

The function formula_267 is the unique elliptic function having simple poles at formula_268 (with formula_269) with residues formula_270 taking the value formula_271 at formula_271.

The function formula_273 is the unique elliptic function having simple poles at formula_268 (with formula_269) with residues formula_276 taking the value formula_277 at formula_271.

The function formula_279 is the unique elliptic function having simple poles at formula_268 (with formula_269) with residues formula_282 taking the value formula_277 at formula_271.

==Special values==
Setting formula_285 gives the lemniscate elliptic functions formula_286 and formula_287:

:formula_288

When formula_223 or formula_224, the Jacobi elliptic functions are reduced to non-elliptic functions:

For the Jacobi amplitude, formula_291 and formula_292 where formula_293 is the Gudermannian function.

In general if neither of p,q is d then formula_294.

To get &quot;x&quot;3, we take the tangent of twice the arctangent of the modulus.
Also this equation leads to the sn-value of the third of &quot;K&quot;:

These equations lead to the other values of the Jacobi-Functions:

Fifth K formula
Following equation has following solution:
:formula_306
:formula_307
To get the sn-values, we put the solution x into following expressions:
:formula_308
:formula_309

=== Relations between squares of the functions ===
Relations between squares of the functions can be derived from two basic relationships (Arguments (&quot;u&quot;,&quot;m&quot;) suppressed):
formula_310
formula_311
where &quot;m + m&#x27; &quot;= 1. Multiplying by any function of the form &quot;nq&quot; yields more general equations:

formula_312
formula_313

With &quot;q&quot; = &quot;d&quot;, these correspond trigonometrically to the equations for the unit circle (formula_314) and the unit ellipse (formula_315), with &quot;x&quot; = &quot;cd&quot;, &quot;y&quot; = &quot;sd&quot; and &quot;r&quot; = &quot;nd&quot;. Using the multiplication rule, other relationships may be derived. For example:

formula_316

formula_317

formula_318

formula_319

=== Addition theorems ===
The functions satisfy the two square relations (dependence on &quot;m&quot; suppressed)
formula_320

formula_321

From this we see that (cn, sn, dn) parametrizes an elliptic curve which is the intersection of the two quadrics defined by the above two equations. We now may define a group law for points on this curve by the addition formulas for the Jacobi functions

formula_322

The Jacobi epsilon and zn functions satisfy a quasi-addition theorem:
formula_323

Double angle formulae can be easily derived from the above equations by setting &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;. Half angle formulae are all of the form:

formula_324

where:
formula_325
formula_326
formula_327
formula_328

==Jacobi elliptic functions as solutions of nonlinear ordinary differential equations==
===Derivatives with respect to the first variable===
The derivatives of the three basic Jacobi elliptic functions (with respect to the first variable, with formula_12 fixed) are:
formula_330
formula_331
formula_332

These can be used to derive the derivatives of all other functions as shown in the table below (arguments (u,m) suppressed):

Also
:formula_333

With the addition theorems above and for a given &quot;m&quot; with 0 &lt; &quot;m&quot; &lt; 1 the major functions are therefore solutions to the following nonlinear ordinary differential equations:

* formula_334 solves the differential equations formula_335 and
:formula_336 (for formula_183 not on a branch cut)
* formula_338 solves the differential equations formula_339 and formula_340
* formula_341 solves the differential equations formula_342 and formula_343
* formula_344 solves the differential equations formula_345 and formula_346

The function which exactly solves the pendulum differential equation,
:formula_347
with initial angle formula_348 and zero initial angular velocity is

:formula_349
where formula_350, formula_351 and formula_352.

===Derivatives with respect to the second variable===

With the first argument formula_353 fixed, the derivatives with respect to the second variable formula_12 are as follows:

:formula_355

==Expansion in terms of the nome==

Let the nome be formula_356, formula_357, formula_358 and let formula_359. Then the functions have expansions as Lambert series

:formula_360

:formula_361

:formula_362

:formula_363

:formula_364

when formula_365

Bivariate power series expansions have been published by Schett.

==Fast computation==
The theta function ratios provide an efficient way of computing the Jacobi elliptic functions. There is an alternative method, based on the arithmetic-geometric mean and Landen&#x27;s transformations:

Initialize
:formula_366
where formula_143.
Define
:formula_368
where formula_369.
Then define
:formula_370
for formula_142 and a fixed formula_372. If
:formula_373
for formula_369, then
:formula_375
as formula_376. This is notable for its rapid convergence. It is then trivial to compute all Jacobi elliptic functions from the Jacobi amplitude formula_112 on the real line.

In conjunction with the addition theorems for elliptic functions (which hold for complex numbers in general) and the Jacobi transformations, the method of computation described above can be used to compute all Jacobi elliptic functions in the whole complex plane.

Another method of fast computation of the Jacobi elliptic functions via the arithmetic–geometric mean, avoiding the computation of the Jacobi amplitude, is due to Herbert E. Salzer:

Let
:formula_378
:formula_379
Set
:formula_380
Then
:formula_381
as formula_376.

Yet, another method for a rapidly converging fast computation of the Jacobi elliptic sine function found in the literature is shown below.

Let:

:formula_383

Then set:

:formula_384

Then:

:formula_385.

==Approximation in terms of hyperbolic functions==

The Jacobi elliptic functions can be expanded in terms of the hyperbolic functions. When formula_12 is close to unity, such that formula_387 and higher powers of formula_388 can be neglected, we have:
* sn(&quot;u&quot;): formula_389
* cn(&quot;u&quot;): formula_390
* dn(&quot;u&quot;): formula_391
For the Jacobi amplitude,
formula_392

==Continued fractions==

Assuming real numbers formula_393 with formula_394, formula_357 with elliptic modulus formula_396. If formula_397, where formula_398 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, then holds the following continued fraction expansion
:formula_399
Known continued fractions involving formula_400 and formula_401 with elliptic modulus formula_59 are

== Inverse functions ==

The inverses of the Jacobi elliptic functions can be defined similarly to the inverse trigonometric functions; if formula_418, formula_419. They can be represented as elliptic integrals, and power series representations have been found.

*formula_420
*formula_421
*formula_422

== Map projection ==

The Peirce quincuncial projection is a map projection based on Jacobian elliptic functions.

== History ==
&quot;Nishinippon Shimbun&quot; began in 1877 as the &quot;Chikushi Shimbun&quot; to report the Seinan Civil War. In 1880 it became the &quot;Fukuoka Nichi-Nichi Shimbun&quot; and then in 1942, during the Pacific War, it joined with &quot;Kyushu Hodo&quot; to form the &quot;Nishinippon Shimbun&quot;.

== Domestic network ==
&quot;Nishinippon Shimbun&quot; is the largest regional newspaper in Kyushu. Its reporters network covers all of Kyushu. In addition to its main office in Fukuoka City, it has 65 local offices in the 7 prefectures of Kyushu, and has Tokyo and Osaka branches.

== Foreign correspondents network ==
&quot;Nishinippon Shimbun&quot; has six foreign bureaus, in Washington, D.C., Paris, Beijing, Taipei, Seoul, and Bangkok. It has also had a writer program with Busan Ilbo in Busan, Korea.

== Events and teams sponsored ==
In 1950, &quot;Nishinippon Shimbun&quot; owned the Nishi-Nippon Pirates, a Japanese baseball team and a founding member of Nippon Professional Baseball&#x27;s Central League. The Pirates only lasted one season before being merged with the Nishitetsu Clippers to form the Nishitetsu Lions.

The &quot;Nishinippon Shimbun&quot; sponsors the Prince Takamatsu Cup Nishinippon Round-Kyūshū Ekiden (Grand Tour Kyushu), the world&#x27;s longest relay race.

<text>The 1935 Labor Day hurricane was an extremely powerful and devastating Atlantic hurricane that struck the southeastern United States in early September 1935. For several decades, it was the most intense Atlantic hurricane on record in terms of barometric pressure until being surpassed by Hurricane Gilbert in 1988; the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record in terms of 1-minute sustained winds (surpassed by Hurricane Allen in 1980); and the strongest at landfall by 1-minute sustained winds (tied with Hurricane Dorian in 2019). The fourth tropical cyclone, third tropical storm, second hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 1935 Atlantic hurricane season, it is one of four Category 5 hurricanes on record to strike the contiguous United States, along with Hurricane Camille (1969), Hurricane Andrew (1992), and Hurricane Michael (2018).

The hurricane intensified rapidly during its time, passing near Long Key on Labor Day evening, September 2. The region was swept by a massive storm surge as the eye passed over the area. The waters quickly receded after carving new channels connecting the bay with the ocean; however, gale-force winds and rough seas persisted into Tuesday, disrupting rescue efforts. The storm continued northwestward along the Florida west coast, weakening before making its second landfall near Cedar Key, Florida, on September 4.

The hurricane caused catastrophic damage in the upper Florida Keys, as a storm surge of approximately swept over the low-lying islands. The hurricane&#x27;s strong winds and the surge destroyed nearly all the structures between Tavernier and Marathon. The town of Islamorada was obliterated. Portions of the Key West Extension of the Florida East Coast Railway were severely damaged or destroyed. In addition, many veterans died in work camps created for the construction of the Overseas Highway, in part due to poor working conditions. The hurricane also caused more damage in northwest Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas.

==Meteorological history==

An area of disturbed weather developed northeast of the Turks Islands toward the end of August. By August 31, a definite tropical depression appeared near Long Island in the southeastern Bahamas and quickly intensified. It reached hurricane intensity near the south end of Andros Island on September 1. The storm then explosively intensified and turned toward the Florida Keys at a speed of 10 mph. The storm had an eye across. The storm made landfall late on September 2 near Long Key, at peak intensity, with an intensity of and 1-minute sustained winds of . After leaving the Keys, the storm weakened as it skirted the Florida gulf coast, making a second landfall at Cedar Key. The storm sped up and rapidly weakened over the Mid-Atlantic states, causing heavy rainfall, with the highest total being in Easton, Maryland. The storm finally emerged over the open Atlantic near Cape Henry. The storm continued into the North Atlantic Ocean, where it merged with an extratropical cyclone on September 10.
The first recorded instance of an aircraft flown for the specific purpose of locating a hurricane occurred on the afternoon of September 2, 1935. The Weather Bureau&#x27;s 1:30 PM advisory placed the center of the hurricane at north latitude 23° 20&#x27;, west longitude 80° 15&#x27;, moving slowly westward. This was about north of Isabela de Sagua, Villa Clara, Cuba, and east of Havana. Captain Leonard Povey of the Aviation Corps of the Cuban Army (Cuerpo de Aviación del Ejército de Cuba) volunteered to investigate the threat to the capital. Flying a Curtis Hawk II, Captain Povey, an American expatriate, who was the Aviation Corps&#x27; chief training officer, observed the storm north of its reported position. Because he was flying an open-cockpit biplane, he opted not to fly into the storm. He later proposed an aerial hurricane patrol. Nothing further came of this idea until June 1943, when Colonel Joe Duckworth and Lieutenant Ralph O&#x27;Hair flew into a hurricane near Galveston, Texas.

===Records===
The Labor Day hurricane was the most intense tropical cyclone known to make landfall in the Western Hemisphere, having the lowest sea level pressure ever officially recorded on land—a central pressure of —suggesting an intensity of between . The somewhat compensating effects of a slow () translational velocity along with an extremely tiny radius of maximum wind () led to an analyzed intensity at landfall of . The 1935 Labor Day hurricane is tied with 2019&#x27;s Hurricane Dorian for the highest intensity for a landfalling Atlantic hurricane in HURDAT2, as 1969&#x27;s Hurricane Camille has been reanalyzed in 2014 to have the third highest landfalling intensity with winds.

==Preparations==
Northeast storm warnings were ordered displayed from Fort Pierce to Fort Myers in the September 1, 9:30 AM Weather Bureau advisory. Upon receipt of this advisory the U.S. Coast Guard Station, Miami, FL, sent a plane along the coast to advise boaters and campers of the impending danger by dropping message blocks. A second flight was made on Sunday afternoon. After, planes were placed in the hangar and its door closed at 10:00 AM Monday. The 3:30 AM advisory, September 2 (Labor Day), predicted the disturbance &quot;will probably pass through the Florida Straits Monday&quot; and cautioned &quot;against high tides and gales Florida Keys and ships in path.&quot; The 1:30 PM advisory ordered hurricane warnings for the Key West district which extended north to Key Largo. At around 2:00 PM, Fred Ghent, Assistant Administrator, Florida Emergency Relief Administration, requested a special train to evacuate the veterans work camps located in the upper keys. It departed Miami at 4:25 PM; delayed by a draw bridge opening, obstructions across the track, poor visibility and the necessity to back the locomotive below Homestead (so it could head out on the return trip) the train finally arrived at the Islamorada station on Upper Matecumbe Key at about 8:20 PM. This coincided with an abrupt wind shift from the northeast (Florida Bay) to southeast (Atlantic Ocean) and the arrival on the coast of the storm surge.

==Impact==

Three ships were reported to have run aground during the storm. The Danish motorship &quot;Leise Maersk&quot; was carried over and grounded nearly 4 miles away near Upper Matecumbe Key, although there was no loss of life. The engine room was flooded and the ship was disabled. The American tanker &quot;Pueblo&quot; lost control near around 2 pm on September 2 and was pushed around the storm&#x27;s center, ending up in Molasses Reef nearly eight hours later. The passenger steamship &quot;Dixie&quot; ran aground on French Reef. She was re-floated and towed to New York on September 19. No fatalities resulted from the incident.

On Upper Matecumbe Key, near Islamorada, an eleven-car evacuation train encountered a powerful storm surge topped by cresting waves. Eleven cars were swept from the tracks, leaving only the locomotive and tender upright and still on the rails. Remarkably, everyone on the train survived. The locomotive and tender were both barged back to Miami several months later.

The hurricane left a path of near-total destruction in the Upper Keys, centered on what is today the village of Islamorada. The eye of the storm passed a few miles to the southwest creating a calm of about 40 minutes duration over Lower Matecumbe and 55 minutes (9:20–10:15 PM) over Long Key. At Camp #3 on Lower Matecumbe the surge arrived near the end of the calm with the wind close behind. Nearly every structure was demolished, and some bridges and railway embankments were washed away. The links—rail, road, and ferry boats—that chained the islands together were broken. The main transportation route linking the Keys to mainland Florida had been a single railroad line, the Florida Overseas Railroad portion of the Florida East Coast Railway. The Islamorada area was devastated, although the hurricane&#x27;s destructive path was narrower than most tropical cyclones. Its eye was across and the fiercest winds extended off the center, less than 1992&#x27;s Hurricane Andrew, which was also a relatively small and catastrophic Category 5 hurricane. Craig Key, Long Key, and Upper Matecumbe and Lower Matecumbe Keys suffered the worst. The storm caused wind and flood damage along the Florida panhandle and into Georgia, and significant damage to the Tampa Bay Area. After the third day of the storm corpses swelled and split open in the subtropical heat, according to rescue workers. Public health officials ordered plain wood coffins holding the dead to be stacked and burned in several locations. The National Weather Service estimated 408 deaths from the hurricane. Bodies were recovered as far away as Flamingo and Cape Sable on the southwest tip of the Florida mainland.

The United States Coast Guard and other federal and state agencies organized evacuation and relief efforts. Boats and airplanes carried injured survivors to Miami. The railroad was never rebuilt, but temporary bridges and ferry landings were under construction as soon as materials arrived. On March 29, 1938, the last gap in the Overseas Highway linking Key West to the mainland was completed. The new highway incorporated the roadbed and surviving bridges of the railway.

The storm brought over of rain to parts of Georgia when it passed over the state between September 4–5. The heavy rainfall in southern Georgian counties led to the spoilage of cotton. Attendant winds also ruined crops and inflicted minor damage to property. Property damage along the coastal regions of South Carolina amounted to $15,000, with the damage primarily occurring in the vicinity of Beaufort, Georgetown, and Walterboro. Damage to crops in South Carolina was also considerable, with high winds blowing down cotton, corn, sugar cane, and other unharvested crops. Windthrown trees also injured several people. Although winds had decreased over land by the time the storm reached the Mid-Atlantic states, the storm brought excessive rainfall that caused substantial damage to the region&#x27;s crops. The storm became the wettest tropical cyclone on record for ten counties in Maryland and two counties in Delaware, with rainfall totals peaking between ; the highest measured rainfall total was in Easton, Maryland. Corn suffered heavy losses in Virginia, contributing the bulk of the state&#x27;s $1.65 million crop damage toll. Impacts from the storm in Maryland and Delaware were primarily concentrated in the southern portions of the two states; the cost of the damage amounted to around $2 million, including losses of $1 million in Caroline County, Maryland.

==Aftermath==
===Response===
====Veterans&#x27; work camps====

Three veterans&#x27; work camps existed in the Florida Keys before the hurricane: #1 on Windley Key, #3 and #5 on Lower Matecumbe Key. The camp payrolls for August 30 listed 695 veterans. They were employed in a project to complete the Overseas Highway connecting the mainland with Key West. The camps, including seven in Florida and four in South Carolina, were established by Harry L. Hopkins, director of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). In the autumn of 1934 the problem of transient veterans in Washington, D.C. &quot;threatened ... to become acute and did become acute in January.&quot; Facilities in the capital were inadequate to handle the large numbers of veterans seeking jobs. President Franklin D. Roosevelt met with Mr. Hopkins and Robert Fechner, director of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) to discuss solutions. He &quot;suggested the Southern camp plan and approved the program worked out by Mr. Hopkins for their establishment and maintenance.&quot; The VA identified eligible veterans. FERA offered grants to the states for their construction projects if they would accept the veterans as laborers. The state Emergency Relief Administrations were responsible for the daily management of the camps. In practice the state ERAs were very much the creatures of FERA, to the extent of handpicking the administrators. That only two states participated was perhaps attributable to the then popular impression that the transient veterans were &quot;diseased&quot; bums and hoboes. It was a characterization enthusiastically fed by the media. In August 1935 both &quot;Time Magazine&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; published sensational articles. On August 15, 1935, Hopkins announced the termination of the veterans work program and closure of all the camps.

On August 26 and 27, 1935, one of the veterans, Albert C. Keith, wrote letters to both the President and Eleanor Roosevelt urging that the camps not be closed. Keith was editor of the weekly camp paper, the &quot;Key Veteran News&quot;. He was emphatic that the veterans were being defamed and that their work program was a success story, rehabilitating many veterans for return to civilian life. &quot;The News&quot; published occasional reports from Camp #2, Mullet Key, St. Petersburg, Florida, at the entrance to Tampa Bay. This was the &quot;colored&quot; veterans camp; the Keys camps were white only. In early August the colored veterans were transferred to the new Camp #8 in Gainesville, Florida.

====Rescue====
Improved weather conditions on Wednesday, September 4, permitted the evacuation of survivors to begin. Participation of the rescue included American Red Cross, Florida National Guard, Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), Works Progress Administration (WPA), Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), United States Coast Guard, American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Dade County Undertakers Association, Dade County Medical Society, city and county officials, and numerous individuals, including Ernest Hemingway. Headquarters of the operation was the near shore of Snake Creek on Plantation Key. With the bridge over the creek washed out, this was the farthest point south on the highway. On September 5 at a meeting of all public and private agencies involved Governor David Sholtz placed the sheriffs of Monroe and Dade Counties in overall control.

On the evening of September 4, 1935, Brigadier General Frank T. Hines, VA Administrator, received a phone call from Hyde Park, New York. It was Stephen Early, the President&#x27;s press secretary. He had orders from the President who was very distressed by the news from Florida. The VA was to: 1. Cooperate with FERA in seeing that everything possible be done for those injured in the hurricane; 2. See that the bodies were properly cared for shipment home to relatives, and that those bodies for which shipment home was not requested be sent to Arlington National Cemetery; and, 3. Conduct a very careful joint investigation with Mr. Hopkins&#x27; organization, to determine whether there was any fault that would lie against anyone in the Administration. Hines&#x27;s representative in Florida was to take full charge of the situation and all other organizations and agencies were ordered to cooperate.

The President&#x27;s first order was straightforward and promptly executed. 124 injured veterans were treated in Miami area hospitals; 9 of these died and 56 were later transferred to VA medical facilities. Uninjured veterans were removed to Camp Foster in Jacksonville and evaluated for transfer to the CCC; those declining transfer or deemed unemployable were paid off and given tickets home. All of the FERA transient camps were closed in November 1935. In December 1935 FERA itself was absorbed within the new WPA, also directed by Hopkins.

====Recovery====
The second and third orders, however, were almost immediately compromised. At a news conference on September 5, Hopkins asserted that there was no negligence traceable to FERA in the failed evacuation of the camps as the Weather Bureau advisories had given insufficient warning. He also dispatched his assistant, Aubrey Willis Williams, to Florida to coordinate FERA efforts and to investigate the deaths. Williams and Hines&#x27; assistant, Colonel George E. Ijams, both arrived in Miami on September 6. Ijams concentrated on the dead, their collection, identification and proper disposition. This was to prove exceptionally difficult. Bodies were scattered throughout the Keys and their rapid decomposition created ghastly conditions. State and local health officials demanded a ban on all movement of bodies and their immediate burial or cremation in place; the next day Governor Sholtz so ordered. This was reluctantly agreed to by Hines with the understanding that those buried would be later disinterred and shipped home or to Arlington when permitted by the State health authorities.

The cremations began on Saturday, September 7; 38 bodies were burned together at the collection point beside Snake Creek. Over the next week 136 bodies were cremated on Upper Matecumbe Key at 12 different locations. On Lower Matecumbe Key, 82 were burned at 20 sites. On numerous small keys in Florida Bay, bodies were either burned or buried where found. This effort continued into November. 123 bodies had been transported to Miami before the embargo. These were processed at a temporary morgue staffed by fingerprint experts and 8 volunteer undertakers under tents at Woodlawn Park Cemetery. The intention was to identify the remains and prepare them for burial or shipment. With the embargo in force, immediate burial of all the bodies at Woodlawn was mandatory. FERA purchased a plot in Section 2A. The VA coordinated the ceremony with full military honors on September 8. 109 bodies were buried in the FERA plot: 81 veterans, nine civilians, and 19 unidentified bodies.

The Florida Emergency Relief Administration reported that as of November 19, 1935, 423 people died: 259 veterans and 164 civilians. By March 1, 1936, 62 additional bodies had been recovered, bringing the total to 485: 257 veterans and 228 civilians. The discrepancy in veterans&#x27; deaths resulted from the difficulty in identifying bodies, particularly those found months after the hurricane, and a question of definition; whether to count just those on the camp payrolls or to include others, not enrolled, who happened to be veterans.

The Veterans&#x27; Affairs Administration (VA) compiled its list of veterans&#x27; deaths: 
121 dead-positive identifications, 90 missing, and 45 dead-identification tentative - totaling 256. Five others are named in a footnote. One proved to be a misidentification of a previously listed veteran; two were state employees working at the camps, and two were unaffiliated veterans caught in the storm. This gave a total of 260 veterans. Adding this to the Florida Emergency Relief Administration number for civilians gave a total of 488 deaths, 12 of the dead were listed as &quot;colored&quot;.

Ernest Hemingway visited the veteran&#x27;s camp by boat after weathering the hurricane at his home in Key West; he wrote about the devastation in a critical article titled &quot;Who Killed the Vets?&quot; for &quot;The New Masses&quot; magazine. Hemingway implied that the FERA workers and families, unfamiliar with the risks of Florida hurricane season, were unwitting victims of a system that appeared to lack concern for their welfare.

In the same issue of &quot;The New Masses&quot; appeared an editorial charging criminal negligence and a cartoon by Russell T. Limbach, captioned &quot;An Act of God&quot;, depicting burning corpses.

A &quot;The Washington Post&quot; editorial on September 5, titled &quot;Ruin in the Veterans&#x27; Camps&quot;, stated the widely held opinion that the

camps were havens of rest designed to keep Bonus Marchers away from Washington ... Most of these veterans are drifters, psychopathic cases or habitual troublemakers ... Those who are nor physically or mentally handicapped have no claim whatsoever to special rewards in return for bonus agitation.

====Investigation====

Meanwhile, Williams rushed to complete the investigation. He finished on Sunday, September 8, the day an elaborate memorial service and mass burial of hurricane victims (both coordinated by Ijams) were held in Miami. Ijams, who had been too busy to participate in the investigation and had not questioned any of the 12 witnesses interrogated by Williams, nonetheless signed the 15-page report to the President. That night Williams released it to the Miami press in a radio broadcast immediately following the memorial ceremony. Ijams considered the timing unfortunate after receiving several critical telephone messages. The report exonerated everyone involved and concluded: &quot;To our mind the catastrophe must be characterized as an act of God and was by its very nature beyond the power of man or instruments at his disposal to foresee sufficiently far enough in advance to permit the taking of adequate precautions capable of preventing the death and desolation which occurred.&quot; Early also found the publicity around the report &quot;unfortunate&quot;. In a telegram to his colleague, assistant Presidential secretary Marvin H. McIntyre, Early wrote that he had authorized Hines to proceed with a &quot;complete and exhaustive&quot; joint investigation with Hopkins. Significantly Hines was to &quot;instruct his investigator that under no circumstances will any statement be made to the Press until final report has been submitted to the President.&quot; Hopkins gave similar instructions to his investigator. McIntyre also was involved in damage control. On Sept. 10, 1935, the Greater Miami Ministerial Association wrote the President an angry letter labeling the report a &quot;whitewash&quot;. McIntyre forwarded it to FERA for a response. Williams returned a draft for the President&#x27;s signature on Sept. 25th insisting the report was only preliminary and that the &quot;final and detailed report ... will be both thorough and searching&quot;.

Williams assigned John Abt, assistant general counsel for FERA, to complete the investigation. On Sept. 11, 1935, Hines directed the skeptical and meticulous David W. Kennamer to investigate the disaster. There was immediate friction between them; Kennamer believed Abt did not have an open mind and Abt felt further investigation was unnecessary. Working with Harry W. Farmer, another VA investigator, Kennamer completed his 2 volume report on October 30, 1935. Farmer added a third volume concerning the identification of the veterans. Kennamer&#x27;s report included 2,168 pages of exhibits, 118 pages of findings, and a 19-page general comment. His findings differed substantially from those of Williams, citing three officials of the Florida Emergency Relief Administration as negligent (Administrator Conrad Van Hyning, Asst. Administrator Fred Ghent and Camp Superintendent Ray Sheldon). In a response to Abt&#x27;s draft report to the President, Ijams sided with Kennamer. Hines and Hopkins never agreed on a final report, and Kennamer&#x27;s findings were suppressed. They remained so for decades.

One might speculate that Hines wished to avoid a public quarrel with Hopkins, who had enjoyed Roosevelt&#x27;s patronage since his term as New York Governor. Hines was a holdover from the Hoover administration. Such an internal dispute would embarrass the Roosevelt administration at the time a vote on the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act (&quot;Bonus Bill&quot;) was upcoming (it passed on Jan. 27, 1936, over the President&#x27;s veto). Also, 1936 was a presidential election year. Kennamer did appear at the House hearings in April 1936, along with Hines, Ijams, Williams and the 3 officials he pilloried in his report. He was not questioned about his controversial findings nor did he volunteer his opinions.

On November 1, 1935, the American Legion completed its own report on the hurricane. The Legion&#x27;s National Commander, Ray Murphy, mailed a copy to President Roosevelt. It concluded that:

Williams prepared a response for the President stating: &quot;A final report, based upon the facts obtained in this investigation [by the VA and FERA], will be submitted to me shortly. At that time I shall transmit a copy of the report to you for your information and consideration.&quot;

===Memorials===
====Islamorada====

Standing just east of U.S. 1 at mile marker 82 in Islamorada, near where Islamorada&#x27;s post office stood, is a monument designed by the Florida Division of the Federal Art Project and constructed using Keys limestone (&quot;keystone&quot;) by the Works Progress Administration. It was unveiled on November 14, 1937, with several hundred people attending. President Roosevelt sent a telegram to the dedication in which he expressed &quot;heartfelt sympathy&quot; and said, &quot;the disaster which made desolate the hearts of so many of our people brought a personal sorrow to me because some years ago I knew many residents of the keys.&quot; The welcoming committee included Key West Mayor Willard M. Albury, and other local officials. Hines had been invited to speak but he declined. His attitude to the project was unenthusiastic. In a letter to Williams on June 24, 1937, regarding what to do with the many skeletons of veterans recently discovered in the Keys, he wrote: ″It occurs to me that if a large memorial is erected adjacent to this highway at the place of the disaster it will be observed by all persons using the highway and will serve as a constant reminder of the unfortunate catastrophe which occurred.″ Hines recommended the remains be buried at Woodlawn. A frieze depicts palm trees amid curling waves, fronds bent in the wind. In front of the sculpture a ceramic-tile mural of the Keys covers a stone crypt, which holds victims&#x27; ashes from the makeshift funeral pyres, commingled with the skeletons.

Although this is a gravesite, no name appears anywhere on the monument. This is not a requirement for the estimated 228 civilian dead, 55 of whom were buried where found or in various cemeteries. A memorial with identifying information is a statutory entitlement for the veterans. 

The memorial was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on March 16, 1995. A Heritage Monument Trail plaque mounted on a coral boulder before the memorial reads:

The Florida Keys Memorial, known locally as the &quot;Hurricane Monument,&quot; was built to honor hundreds of American veterans and local citizens who perished in the &quot;Great Hurricane&quot; on Labor Day, September 2, 1935. Islamorada sustained winds of 200 miles per hour and a barometer reading of 26.35 inches for many hours on that fateful holiday; most local buildings and the Florida East Coast Railway were destroyed by what remains the most savage hurricane on record. Hundreds of World War I veterans who had been camped in the Matecumbe area while working on the construction of U.S. Highway One for the Works Progress Administration (WPA) were killed. In 1937 the cremated remains of approximately 300 people were placed within the tiled crypt in front of the monument. The monument is composed of native keystone, and its striking frieze depicts coconut palm trees bending before the force of hurricane winds while the waters from an angry sea lap at the bottom of their trunks. Monument construction was funded by the WPA and regional veterans&#x27; associations. Over the years the Hurricane Monument has been cared for by local veterans, hurricane survivors, and descendants of the victims.

Local residents hold ceremonies at the monument every year on Labor Day (on the Monday holiday) and on Memorial Day to honor the veterans and the civilians who died in the hurricane.

====Woodlawn Park North Cemetery====

On January 31, 1936, Harvey W. Seeds Post No. 29, American Legion, Miami, Florida, petitioned FERA for the deed to the Woodlawn plot. The Legion would use the empty grave sites for the burial of indigent veterans and accept responsibility for care of the plot. After some initial confusion as to the actual owner, the State of Florida approved the title transfer. A monument was placed on the plot, inscribed: &quot;Erected by Harvey W. Seeds Post No. 29, The American Legion, in Memory of Our Comrades Who Lost Their Lives on the Florida Keys during the 1935 Hurricane, Lest We Forget&quot;.
As with the Islamorada memorial no names are listed, nor were the individual grave sites for the 81 identified veterans marked at Woodlawn. The VA again chose not to obey the President&#x27;s order, this time to rebury the unclaimed bodies at Arlington. Four bodies were, however, exhumed from Woodlawn cemetery by the families: Brady C. Lewis (November 12, 1936), Benjamin B. Jakeman (December 12, 1936), Thomas K. Moore (January 20, 1937), and Frank De Albar (September 26, 2016). Families marked 5 more graves at Woodlawn. The cemetery director, Gabriel E. Romanach Jr., marked 71 graves with VA markers, leaving 1 unmarked grave as of 2024.

One other veteran killed in the storm rests at Arlington, Daniel C. Main. His was a special case, the only veteran who died in the camps who was neither cremated in the Keys nor buried at Woodlawn. Main was the camp medical director and was killed in the collapse of the small hospital at Camp #1. His body was quickly recovered by survivors and shipped to his family before the embargo.

====Veterans Key====

On February 27, 2006, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names approved a proposal by Jerry Wilkinson, President, Historical Preservation Society of the Upper Keys, to name a small island off the southern tip of Lower Matecumbe Key for the veterans who died in the hurricane. It is near where Camp #3 was located. &quot;Veterans Key&quot; and several concrete pilings are all that remain of the 1935 bridge construction project.

====Department of Veterans Affairs Actions====

Government furnished headstones and grave markers are provided for eligible veterans buried in National Cemeteries, State veterans cemeteries and private cemeteries. Memorial markers are also provided when remains are unavailable for burial. Under a 2009 VA regulation the applicant in all cases was defined as the veteran&#x27;s next of kin. Prior to the 2009 rule any person with knowledge of the veteran could apply. When enforcement began in 2012, many groups and volunteers objected. They had worked for decades in cooperation with the VA to mark unmarked veterans&#x27; graves, many from the Civil War era. They argued that the next-of-kin (if any) was often impossible to locate and that the very existence of an unmarked grave was evidence of the family&#x27;s indifference. Two bills were introduced in Congress, H. R. 2018 and S. 2700 which would have again allowed unrelated applicants. Both bills died in committee. On October 1, 2014, the VA proposed a rule change which would include unrelated individuals in the categories of applicants .
The revision became effective on March 2, 2016. It added several categories of applicants unrelated to the veteran for headstones and grave markers; however, it retained the family member only restriction on memorial markers. This provision was challenged in an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. The case was argued on January 14, 2021 and decided on February 28, 2022. The court ruled that the restriction was arbitrary and capricious, that it be set aside and remanded for further development. The VA appealed the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, but filed a joint stipulation of voluntary dismissal on April 24, 2024. Memorial markers for 166 veterans lost in the Labor Day Hurricane were placed at South Florida National Cemetery in 2023.

<text>The Korea Times () is a daily English-language newspaper in South Korea. It is a sister paper of the &quot;Hankook Ilbo&quot;, a major Korean-language daily.

It is the oldest active daily English-language newspaper in South Korea. Since the late 1950s, it had been published by the Hankook Ilbo Media Group, but following an embezzlement scandal in 2013–2014 it was sold to Dongwha Group in 2015. The president-publisher of &quot;The Korea Times&quot; is Oh Young-jin.

== Description ==
The newspaper&#x27;s headquarters is located in the same building with &quot;Hankook Ilbo&quot; on Sejong-daero between Sungnyemun and Seoul Station in Seoul, South Korea. The publication also hosts major operations in New York City and Los Angeles.

The paper is not to be confused with &quot;The Korea Daily News&quot;, a 1904 to 1910 newspaper which briefly ran under the title &quot;Korea Times&quot;. It is also unrelated to another paper by Lee Myo-muk, Ha Kyong-tok and Kim Yong-ui in September 1945.

== History ==

&quot;The Korea Times&quot; was founded by Helen Kim five months into the 1950-53 Korean War. The first issue on November 1 was a two-page tabloid. It was printed six days a week, skipping Mondays, and cost 100 won. Kim set out to start the paper in 1949 when she became president of Ewha Womans University, and the initial editorial team came from Ewha&#x27;s English literature professors.

Publication began in Seoul after United Nations forces retook Seoul following the Second Battle of Seoul but moved to Busan on January 3, 1951, during the Third Battle of Seoul, with members of the editorial staff leaving Seoul on the last train before Chinese forces took the capital. Prior to leaving the city, a group of five staffers went to Mugyo-dong for food and drink, where they were nearly shot by young South Korean military police who demanded to see their IDs and asked &quot;Why do you all make a fuss with drinking in this emergency time?&quot; Prior to evacuation, the paper&#x27;s editorial office was in the fourth floor of the &quot;fire-gutted&quot; Capitol building, and printing was done at a shop in Bongnae-dong. Publication resumed after 15 days after relocating to Busan, the headlines were handwritten.

The paper maintained close relations with the Syngman Rhee administration, but began to criticize the president due to his interference in its publication. On April 23, 1954, the paper was acquired by Chang Key-young, then president of &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot; and later founder of the &quot;Hankook Ilbo&quot;.

On September 26, 1958, &quot;The Korea Times&quot; managing editor Choi Byung-woo died at age 34, becoming the first Korean war correspondent to die while on duty. A boat carrying Choi and other foreign correspondents covering the Communist Chinese bombing of the Nationalist-led Quemoy and Matsu islands capsized. &quot;The Korea Times&quot; and the &quot;Hankook Ilbo&quot; held a memorial service for Choi at Kyonggi High School, his alma mater, on October 11, 1958. The service was attended by hundreds of mourners. Choi was the main inspiration for the founding of the Kwanhun Club, a fraternity of senior journalists. Choi also played a leading role in the designation of April 7 as &quot;Newspaper Day,&quot; which is observed by Korean journalists to this day.

On Tuesday, February 27, 1968, a fire completely gutted the main office of &quot;The Korea Times&quot; and its sister papers in Junghak-dong, Jongno-gu, downtown Seoul, killing seven workers and injuring three others. After the fire, &quot;The Korea Times&quot; managed to publish an abbreviated edition on February 28. During the restoration period, a number of readers and foreign organizations, including the American Embassy and the U.S. Operations Mission (a U.S. aid mission), either loaned or donated typewriters to &quot;The Korea Times&quot;. The newspaper took refuge in a nearby office in Chungmuro, where production was performed for years.

The paper published its first color image on Christmas Day 1968, showing a four-color picture of a YMCA choir singing a Christmas carol. It converted from hot metal typesetting to a Cold Type System of phototypesetting on its 34th anniversary on November 1, 1984.

Former Korean President Kim Dae-jung famously taught himself English by reading &quot;The Korea Times&quot;.

&quot;The Korea Times&quot; published the official Olympic newspaper named &quot;The Seoul Olympian&quot; for the 1988 Summer Olympics.

==Notable columns==
In 1968, the &quot;Thoughts of the Times&quot; column debuted, providing column space for members of the community. The first column was by Helen Kim. Over the years, the column has produced highly controversial articles.

The column &quot;Scouting the City&quot; ran from 1964 to December 1974, covering numerous controversial topics and criticizing others, including the United States Forces Korea. Under the penname Alf Racketts, the column was really by newspaper staffer James Wade. The author Ahn Junghyo wrote a column in the 1960s and 1970s.

Notable columnists today include Donald Kirk, Michael Breen and Emanuel Pastreich. Detective novelist Martin Limón has also contributed a few articles.

==Controversy==

Twice in history, &quot;The Korea Times&quot; managing editors have been detained over the &quot;Thoughts of the Times&quot; column. Managing editor Henry Chang published &quot;Definition of a Gambler&quot; under the penname &quot;Hensync&quot; on July 30, 1958, leading to his imprisonment for 16 days under sedition charges.

On June 11, 1973, Bernard Wideman wrote a satirical article in response to a &quot;Time&quot; article on Japanese tourists and kisaeng, he put forth outrageous proposals governing the control of women. In response, Orianna West, an American housewife living in Seoul, wrote a response piece calling for the subjugation and exploitation of Korean boys. In response, local newspapers reprinted translations of the satirical articles, criticizing the foreigners. Managing editor Chang Soon-il was taken to the intelligence authorities in response.

On December 25, 2009, columnist Michael Breen contributed a satirical column lampooning various South Korean public figures, including President Lee Myung-bak, singer Rain, and Samsung. The column imagined what public figures would want to send as Christmas gifts. He suggested Samsung would send pictures of Samsung Chairman Lee Kun-hee&#x27;s son Lee Jae-yong with instructions to hang it next to the picture of the chairman, an allusion to North Korea&#x27;s cult of personality. He also suggested the company would send Christmas cards to politicians, prosecutors and journalists with $50,000 gift certificates. Displeased with Breen&#x27;s allusions to their corruption and arrogance, Samsung filed civil and criminal suits against him and the paper for libel. After an apology and after Breen told prosecutors during interrogation that the column was his own idea, the paper was dropped as a respondent, but the suit against Breen himself remained. One South Korean media outlet claimed that the entire column was an insult to the country of South Korea itself. Samsung dropped the civil suit after an apology by Breen. The criminal case went to trial but was thrown out by the judge on the grounds that there was &quot;no victim.&quot;

On September 11, 2015, &quot;The Thoughts of the Times&quot; column published an article titled &quot;Why won&#x27;t you sit next to me on the subway?&quot; It criticized Koreans for avoiding foreigners in public transport and exhibited unstable and aggressive traits in the writer. The article was quickly uncovered as a practical joke. Chief editorial writer Oh Young-jin apologized to readers, threatening law enforcement involvement in future cases, and pledging to keep the paper&#x27;s open-door policy, inviting readers, professional or untrained, to contribute.

On June 2, 2017, then-managing editor Oh Young-jin published a contentious article titled &quot;Holocaust vs. comfort women&quot; in which he tried to answer which was worse: Nazi Germany&#x27;s Holocaust or Imperial Japan&#x27;s wartime sex slavery. On June 5 he published a selection of reader feedback, including one holocaust denier who claimed there were no gas chambers, and that any gassing done was to kill disease-carrying lice to protect the prisoners, saying &quot;Gassing was a life-saving measure, not a homicidal one.&quot; On June 14, he published a letter from a German teacher titled &quot;Holocaust happened&quot; refuting the Holocaust denier and decrying the newspaper for publishing her claims.

&quot;The Korea Times&quot; has been criticized for republishing tabloid news, especially on cryptozoology and UFO sightings. It has reposted articles from &quot;Weekly World News&quot; and &quot;The Onion&quot;, including a widely spread article naming Kim Jong Un &quot;The Onion&#x27;s sexiest man alive&quot; for 2012.

==Modern Korean Literature Translation Awards==

&quot;The Korea Times&quot; established the Modern Korean Literature Translation Awards on its 20th anniversary in 1970, to lay the groundwork for promotion of Korean literature internationally and ultimately to produce a Nobel literature laureate from Korea.

Over the decades, it has awarded rising stars in Korean literature translation. Past winners include Sora Kim-Russell, Bruce Fulton who won three times for short story translations in 1985, 1987 and 1989, and Brother Anthony, who won the top prize for poetry in 1991 with his translation of &quot;Headmaster Abe&quot; by Ko Un. Brother Anthony later served on the judging panel for the awards from 1996 until 2023. Richard Rutt had also been a judge from 1970 to 1973, and Chang Wang-rok, who received commendation awards in 1970 and 1976, was judge between 1982 and 1988. The current three judges are Jung Ha-yun (2000 short story top prize winner), Janet Hong (2001 short story top prize winner), and Dafna Zur (2004 short story top prize winner).

==Other awards==

The Korea Times also runs several other annual awards. 

The Economic Essay Contest invites Korean and foreign university undergrad and grad students to contribute essays on economy-related topics. Winners receive cash prizes. Woori Bank is a sponsor.

The Global Korea Youth Awards were established in 2012 under the name Multicultural Youth Awards, in cooperation with the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family to encourage students from multicultural households.

<doc id="450017" wikidata="Q4834229" url="?curid=450017" title="B. T. Roberts">
<text>Benjamin Titus Roberts (1823–1893) was an American Methodist bishop. He first trained as an attorney, then entered the ministry in the Genesee Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church of New York State. His ministerial studies were done at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. He married Ellen Lois Stowe, had seven children, and pastored several churches in New York state.

==Early career==
During his tenure at Wesleyan University, B. T. Roberts excelled, achieving university honors (Marston, 174). While there, he met Daniel Steele, later to become president of Syracuse University, and William C. Kendall, soon to become Roberts&#x27; comrade for reform in the Genesee Conference (Ibid) Upon graduation, Roberts was offered the presidency of Wyoming Seminary of Kingston, PA, a secondary institution of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Roberts declined the position, electing instead to enter the pastorate, seeking elders orders in Genesee Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. He was admitted to the Conference in 1848 on trial (Ibid.)

Roberts&#x27; first pastoral appointment was Caryville, New York, followed by Pike, New York. Roberts was married during his first charge. At the 1850 annual conference, Roberts was admitted to full membership and ordained a deacon. In 1851, he was sent to the Rushford, New York charge. During these early charges, Roberts demonstrated a concern not only for abolition but also for the destructive effects of wealth upon Methodist livelihood. To Roberts, many of the Methodists in his Genesee Conference, especially those in Conference administration (i.e. bishops and other clergy), were overly concerned with social prestige than with old-time Methodist standards that aim for &quot;growth in holiness,&quot; as John Wesley himself said it. Roberts also encountered leaders of what has come to be called the Holiness Movement, individuals like Phoebe Palmer. Roberts was also influenced by Methodist evangelist John Wesley Redfield.

==Conflict with Methodist Episcopal Church==

In 1852, Roberts was ordained elder and sent to Niagara Street Church, a central church of the district and oldest church in Buffalo, New York. Roberts&#x27; conflict with the conference began in earnest at the Niagara Street appointment for he sought to make the church a &quot;free&quot; church, i.e. eliminate the pew system. Roberts here observed the potential problems of the &quot;pew system&quot; in which wealthy families could purchase and/or rent pews for congregational worship. Roberts, along with a number of other would-be reformers, could essentially identify three problems with the pew system: 1) it ended the segregation of the worshiping congregation into male and female (which John Wesley himself approved of), 2) it commercialized the church, and 3) it discriminated against the poor. (Marston, 178ff.)

In 1853, Roberts was sent to Brockport, New York. By 1854, it was clear that a major, conference-wide conflict was brewing. On the one side were those conservatives who favored traditional Methodist teaching on matters of social and personal ethics, and who favored the traditional Methodist emphasis on entire sanctification. On the other side were those progressives who favored an assimilation of Methodism to prevailing American sensitivities and mores, including a de-emphasis on entire sanctification in favor of more &quot;realistic&quot; ethical expectations. These conflicting undercurrents bubbled to the surface in 1855. Leslie Ray Marston, former bishop in the Free Methodist Church of North America, best described the situation:

In July 1855 the &quot;Buffalo Advocate&quot; accused the minority group of organizing a secret society called the &quot;Nazarite Union,&quot; basing the charge on a document that had come into the hands of Editor Robie, and which had been prepared by the unpredictable Joseph McCreery, Jr. It is true that McCreery did design an organization to combat the &quot;Buffalo Regency,&quot; as the controlling faction came to be called. But McCreery emphatically declared that the so-called &quot;Nazarite Union&quot; existed only on paper, and said &quot;I alone was responsible for the whole concern.&quot; Nevertheless, much was made of the affair and the 1855 Conference adopted a resolution which assumed the actual existence of such a union and passed disapprobation thereon. The term &quot;Nazarite Union&quot; came to designate the reform group for several years, but B. T. Roberts never accepted the designation.
Unfortunately for Roberts and the other so-called &quot;Nazarites,&quot; the so-called &quot;Buffalo Regency&quot; controlled conference officers and appointments. There has been documented accusation (cf. Marston 183) that the Regency were by and large &quot;secret society men,&quot; belonging either to fraternal lodges or meeting in secret outside of Conference meetings in order to bully through policy and resolutions during official Conference meetings. This caused great trouble for Roberts who published the article &quot;New School Methodism&quot; in &quot;The Northern Independent&quot;, a religious news journal, just days before the 1857 Annual Conference met. In the article, Roberts cited exactly where he believed the present day Methodist Episcopal Church to have deviated from its Wesleyan heritage.

In 1857, the Annual Conference of Genesee convened in LeRoy, NY. Ecclesiastical charges were brought against Roberts. All of his attempts at appeal, trial by committee, or trial in civil court of law were denied. Roberts was convicted of &quot;immoral and unchristian conduct.&quot; (Marston, 194) Roberts was not the only Methodist minister to be formally charged by the Genesee Conference in this period, all done so in an avowed effort to stamp out &quot;Naziritism&quot; (i.e. the minority-power reform movement). Though formally reproved, however, Roberts was surprisingly appointed to a new charge in Pekin, NY.

While in Pekin, a local preacher named George W. Estes republished Roberts&#x27; &quot;New School Methodism&quot; in pamphlet form, including with it documentation of Roberts&#x27; trial at the 1857 Annual Conference. (Marston, 197) This was perceived by Conference leadership as a defiance &quot;by Roberts&quot; of his previous reproof. The Annual Conference met in Perry, NY in 1858 at which time Roberts was once again tried and found guilty. He was formally stripped of his ordination but remained a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church as a layman on probation. During the ensuing year, Roberts supported his family as a traveling preacher as he and the reform movement in general had a healthy following among Methodist laity. This support was demonstrated by a number of local church resolutions within the Genesee Conference, condemning the actions of the Conference leadership in its treatment of Roberts.

The idea of separating from the Methodist Episcopal Church had entered the mind of some reformers and had already produced denominational offspring, both in America and in England. However, Roberts attempted to avoid secession, waiting during his probation period to appeal his case directly to the General Conference of the MEC to be held in 1860. Various &quot;free&quot; Methodist churches, independent of the MEC, were formed prior to Roberts&#x27; formation and organization of an official denomination named &quot;Free Methodist.&quot;

==Formation of the Free Methodist Church==

With J. W. Redfield and others, Roberts formed the Free Methodist Church of North America at an organizational conference at Pekin, New York in 1860. That same year he founded a magazine, the &quot;Earnest Christian&quot;. In 1866 he founded Chili Seminary in North Chili, New York, which today is known as Roberts Wesleyan University in his honor. He was general superintendent of the Free Methodist Church from 1860 to 1893. He traveled extensively and was a frequent speaker at Holiness camp meetings.

Roberts was a staunch abolitionist and early Free Methodists derived their name in part from their opposition to slavery. Many of the early Free Methodists were active in the operation of the Underground Railroad. They were highly critical of the Methodist Episcopal Church, from which many of them had come, because it did not boldly denounce slavery.

Another &quot;freedom&quot; Roberts advocated was the practice of using freewill offerings for church support. They were critical of the Methodist practice of pew rentals, which expressed the social prestige of those who rented the most expensive pews. After the separation of the Free Methodists, the Methodist Episcopal Church abolished pew rentals.

Seventeen years after his death, the Methodists returned his ministerial papers to his son, and formally acknowledged that they had wronged him.

<doc id="450022" wikidata="Q750733" url="?curid=450022" title="Grauman's Egyptian Theatre">
<text>Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre, also known as Egyptian Hollywood and the Egyptian, is a historic movie theater located on Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. Opened in 1922, it is an early example of a lavish movie palace and is noted as having been the site of the world&#x27;s first film premiere.

From 1998 until 2020, the Egyptian was owned and operated by the American Cinematheque, and in May 2020, Netflix bought the theater. Following a large restoration project, the theater re-opened in November 2023, with Netflix handling the programming Monday through Thursday and the American Cinematheque overseeing Friday through Sunday.

== History ==
The Egyptian was built by showman Sid Grauman and real estate developer Charles E. Toberman, who subsequently built the nearby El Capitan Theatre and Chinese Theatre. Grauman had previously opened one of the United States&#x27;s first movie palaces, the Million Dollar Theater, part of the Broadway Theater District in Downtown Los Angeles. The Egyptian cost $800,000 and took 18 months to construct. Architects Meyer &amp; Holler designed the building, and it was built by The Milwaukee Building Company.

The Egyptian was the location of world&#x27;s first film premiere, &quot;Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood&quot;, on Wednesday, October 18, 1922. As the film reportedly cost over $1 million to produce, the admission price to the premiere was $5 . One could reserve a seat up to two weeks in advance for the daily performances. Evening admission was 75¢, $1 or $1.50. The film was not shown in any other Los Angeles theater that year. Premieres that took place at the Egyptian after &quot;Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood&quot; include &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; in 1923, &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; in 1924, and &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; in 1925.

In 1927, Grauman opened a second movie theater further west on Hollywood Boulevard. In keeping with the public&#x27;s fascination with international themes, he named his new theater the Chinese Theatre. Its popularity surpassed the Egyptian because of its celebrity handprints, footprints, and signatures in the concrete of its forecourt.

Following the opening of the Chinese, Fox West Coast Theaters operated the Egyptian as a re-run house. The theater returned to first-run premieres in 1944, when it became the exclusive Hollywood showcase for MGM, but due to 1949&#x27;s United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., which barred major studios from operating movie theaters, MGM was forced to relinquish this and all its other theaters. United Artists operated this theater from 1949 to 1992, with the theater showcasing 20th Century Fox films from the 1970s onwards.

In 1955, a large curved Todd-AO screen was added to the theater, with much of the theater&#x27;s original proscenium arch demolished to make room for the screen.

In 1984, the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District was added to the National Register of Historic Places, with the Egyptian Theatre listed as a contributing property in the district. In 1993, the building was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.

===American Cinematheque===
The Egyptian closed in 1992 and fell into disrepair. In 1996, the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles sold the theater to the American Cinematheque for a nominal $1 with the provision that the building be restored to its original grandeur and reopened as a movie theater.

The Cinematheque raised $12.8 million to pay for the restoration, and the theater was reopened to the public on December 4, 1998. The original theater seated 1,760 patrons in a single auditorium, while the restored Egyptian added a second theater. The main theater accommodated 616 patrons and was named after Los Angeles philanthropist Lloyd E. Rigler, while the second theater accommodated 78 was named after Steven Spielberg. In addition to these renovations, the Egyptian&#x27;s forecourt was restored to its original 1922 appearance, and palm trees and planters were also added.

===Netflix===
In April 2019, it was announced that Netflix was seeking to purchase the theater to use as a special events venue, qualify its films for Oscar nominations, screen its films and television shows for Oscar and Emmy voters, and that the American Cinematheque would still hold events on weekends. Immediately after the announcement, a petition campaign called on the American Cinematheque board, the California Attorney General, and Los Angeles City Council to hold a public meeting about the proposed sale. On May 29, 2020, it was announced that Netflix would acquire the theater and invest in renovations. The theater&#x27;s purchase price was reported to be $14.4 million , and the renovations, which included a seismic retrofit, totalled more than $70 million .

In August 2023, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Netflix had restored the theater to its original appearance. This entailed restoring the original neon blade theater sign over Hollywood Boulevard and the original hieroglyphics and artwork on the courtyard walls; renovating the lobby and restoring the interior; and removing elements of the &#x27;90s restoration, including courtyard palm trees, acoustic panels in the auditorium, and the entire balcony section, lowering the seating capacity by 100 to 516 seats. Additionally, modern lighting and sound upgrades have been implemented. In October 2023, Netflix announced that the theater would reopen on November 9 with a screening of &quot;The Killer&quot;, followed by a Q&amp;A session with director David Fincher. Netflix also announced the release of the documentary short film &quot;Temple of Film: 100 Years of the Egyptian Theatre&quot;, which features interviews from Guillermo del Toro, Rian Johnson, Lynette Howell Taylor, Autumn Durald Arkapaw and the theater&#x27;s restoration architect Peyton Hall.

On February 24, 2025, Netflix held the world premiere of &quot;The Electric State&quot; at the theater.

== Architecture and design ==
The exterior of the Egyptian features Egyptian Revival architecture. However, the roof panels above the main entrance are in a Mediterranean, not ancient Egyptian, style. The theater was designed with an Egyptian theme due to public fascination with Howard Carter&#x27;s expeditions searching for the tomb of Tutankhamun. Previously, the theater was to have a Mediterranean-styled design, with the unconfirmed but plausible story being that Mediterranean-styled roof panels were used because they had already been delivered and paid for when the style was changed.

The building&#x27;s exterior walls contain Egyptian-style paintings and hieroglyphs. The front courtyard () was designed to capitalize on Southern California&#x27;s sunny weather and to host the theater&#x27;s red-carpet ceremonies. Storefronts along the east side of the courtyard had an &quot;Oriental motif&quot; and sold imports, while the Pig &#x27;n Whistle was located west and included a side entrance direct from the restaurant to the courtyard.

Originally, the courtyard was also the theater&#x27;s &quot;entrance hall&quot;, as the front doors formerly opened directly into the auditorium. The four columns that mark the theater&#x27;s main entrance are wide and rise .

Inside, the theater originally featured Sphinx sculptures, singer&#x27;s boxes, an orchestra pit, and a proscenium arch with a winged scarab surmounted by a medallion and snakes at its center. Additionally, the theater&#x27;s centerpiece was its massive stylized sunburst device on the ceiling, which doubled as an organ grille. Several of these features, including the sculptures and orchestra pit, were removed when the theater transitioned to sound, and much of the proscenium arch was demolished to make room for an enlarged screen when the theater upgraded to Todd-AO.

In 1997, architecture and design studio Hodgetts + Fung renovated the theater and updated its technology to accommodate American Cinematheque programming. The exterior was restored while projection, sound, seating, mechanical systems, and circulation were improved to 21st century standards. In 2000, the project won the National Preservation Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. 

The Egyptian was further renovated from 2020 to 2023, with a focus on updating the changes made in the previous renovation. Non-original additions such as palm trees and a second-floor balcony were removed, the auditorium ceiling and Egyptian scarab at the proscenium were restored, and the theater technology was modernized again. The entire renovation process, from the 1990s to 2020s, is considered a &quot;case study in reversibility&quot; by Los Angeles city staff.

==Influence and legacy==
The layout, design, and name of the Egyptian Theatre was emulated by other movie palaces across North America, including those in Bala Cynwyd, Boise, Concord, Coos Bay, DeKalb, Delta, El Dorado, Hanover, Montreal, Ogden, Park City, and Seattle.

==In popular culture==
The Egyptian was featured in episode 712 of &quot;Visiting... with Huell Howser&quot;. 

The theater is the location of a gunfight during the conclusion of a case in the video game &quot;L.A. Noire&quot;.

The theater appears in Jonathan Franzen&#x27;s 2021 novel &quot;Crossroads&quot;.

<doc id="450023" wikidata="Q20817212" url="?curid=450023" title="Ginseng">
<text>Ginseng () is the root of plants in the genus &quot;Panax&quot;, such as South China ginseng (&quot;P. notoginseng&quot;), Korean ginseng (&quot;P. ginseng&quot;), and American ginseng (&quot;P. quinquefolius&quot;), characterized by the presence of ginsenosides and gintonin. Ginseng is common in the cuisines and medicines of China and Korea.

Ginseng has been used in traditional medicine over centuries, though modern clinical research is inconclusive about its medical effectiveness. There is no substantial evidence that ginseng is effective for treating any medical condition and it has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat or prevent a disease or to provide a health benefit. Although ginseng is sold as a dietary supplement, inconsistent manufacturing practices for supplements have led to analyses of some ginseng products contaminated with unrelated filler compounds, and its excessive use may have adverse effects or untoward interactions with prescription drugs.

== History ==
One of the first written texts covering the use of ginseng as a medicinal herb was the &quot;Shen Nong Pharmacopoeia&quot;, written in China in 196 AD. In his &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; herbal of 1596, Li Shizhen described ginseng as a &quot;superior tonic&quot;. However, the herb was not used as a &quot;cure-all&quot; medicine, but more specifically as a tonic for patients with chronic illnesses and those who were convalescing.

Control over ginseng fields in China and Korea became an issue in the 16th century.

==In folk belief==
In Chinese folk tales from the northeastern regions, ginseng is said to transform into children, often depicted with skyward-reaching braids, sometimes tied with red ribbons, and occasionally dressed in bellybands. In these stories, a ginseng child will typically enter a house to play with another child. However, if the adults tie a red ribbon around the child&#x27;s feet, the child vanishes. When they follow the ribbon, they find it tied to a blade of grass, and upon digging, they uncover a ginseng root.

== Ginseng species ==
Ginseng plants belong only to the genus &quot;Panax&quot;. Cultivated species include &quot;Panax ginseng&quot; (Korean ginseng), &quot;Panax japonicus&quot; (Japanese ginseng), &quot;Panax notoginseng&quot; (South China ginseng), &quot;Panax quinquefolius&quot; (American ginseng). Ginseng is found in cooler climates – Korean Peninsula, Northeast China, Russian Far East, Canada and the United States, although some species grow in warm regions – South China ginseng being native to Southwest China and Vietnam. &quot;Panax vietnamensis&quot; (Vietnamese ginseng) is the southernmost &quot;Panax&quot; species known.

== Wild and cultivated ginseng ==
=== Wild ginseng ===

Wild ginseng () grows naturally in mountains and is hand-picked by gatherers known as &quot;simmani&quot; (). The wild ginseng plant is almost extinct in China and endangered globally. This is due to high demand for the product in recent years, leading to the harvesting of wild plants faster than they can grow and reproduce (a wild ginseng plant can take years to reach maturity). Wild ginseng can be processed to be red or white ginseng. Wild American ginseng has long been used by Native Americans for medicine. Since the mid-1700s, it has been harvested for international trade. Wild American ginseng can be harvested in 19 states and the Appalachian Mountains but has restrictions for exporting.

=== Cultivated ginseng ===

Cultivated ginseng () is less expensive than the rarely available wild ginseng.

Cultivated ginseng () is planted on mountains by humans and is allowed to grow like wild ginseng.

== Ginseng processing ==

Ginseng seed normally does not germinate until the second spring following the harvest of berries in Autumn. They must first be subjected to a long period of storage in a moist medium with a warm/cold treatment, a process known as stratification.

=== Fresh ginseng ===
Fresh ginseng (), also called &quot;green ginseng&quot;, is non-dried raw product. Its use is limited by availability.

=== White ginseng ===

White ginseng () is peeled and dried ginseng. White ginseng is fresh ginseng which has been dried without being heated. It is peeled and dried to reduce the water content to 12% or less. Drying in the sun bleaches the root to a yellowish-white color.

=== Red ginseng ===
Red ginseng () is steamed and dried ginseng, which has reddish color. Red ginseng is less vulnerable to decay than white ginseng. It is ginseng that has been peeled, heated through steaming at standard boiling temperatures of , and then dried or sun-dried. It is frequently marinated in an herbal brew which results in the root becoming extremely brittle.
== Production ==
Commercial ginseng is sold in over 35 countries, with China as the largest consumer. In 2013, global sales of ginseng exceeded $2 billion, of which half was produced by South Korea. In the early 21st century, 99% of the world&#x27;s 80,000 tons of ginseng was produced in just four countries: China (44,749 tons), South Korea (27,480 tons), Canada (6,486 tons), and the United States (1,054 tons). All ginseng produced in South Korea is Korean ginseng (&quot;P. ginseng&quot;), while ginseng produced in China includes &quot;P. ginseng&quot;, South China ginseng (&quot;P. notoginseng&quot;), and the recently introduced American ginseng (&quot;P. quinquefolius&quot;). Ginseng produced in Canada and the United States is mostly &quot;P. quinquefolius&quot;.

As of 2020, global &quot;P. ginseng&quot; and &quot;P. quinquefolius&quot; production each sum to an approximate 7,000 tons on a dry-weight basis. On a dry-weight basis, 70% of &quot;P. ginseng&quot; and 30% of &quot;P. quinquefolius&quot; is produced in China; 60% of &quot;P. quinquefolius&quot; is produced in Canada; and 10% of &quot;P. quinquefolius&quot; is produced in the US. &quot;P. ginseng&quot; is also cultivated in Japan.

== Uses ==
Ginseng may be included in energy drinks or herbal teas in small amounts or sold as a dietary supplement.

=== Food or beverage ===
The root is most often available in dried form, either whole or sliced. In Korean cuisine, ginseng is used in various &quot;banchan&quot; (side dishes) and &quot;guk&quot; (soups), as well as tea and alcoholic beverages. Ginseng-infused tea and liquor, known as &quot;insam-cha&quot; () and &quot;insam-ju&quot; (&#x27;ginseng liquor&#x27;) is consumed. Ginseng leaves are also used to prepare foods and beverages. Leaves are used to prepare Asian soups, steamed with chicken or combined with ginger, dates, and pork, or are eaten fresh.

===Traditional medicine and phytochemicals===
Although ginseng has been used in traditional medicine for centuries, there is no good evidence it causes any improvement of health or lowers the risk of any disease. Clinical research indicates there are no confirmed effects on memory, fatigue, menopause symptoms, and insulin response in people with mild diabetes. A 2021 review indicated that ginseng had &quot;only trivial effects on erectile function or satisfaction with intercourse compared to placebo&quot;.

Although the roots are used in traditional Chinese medicine, the leaves and stems contain larger quantities of the phytochemicals than the roots, and are easier to harvest. The constituents include steroid saponins known as ginsenosides, as well as polyacetylenes, polysaccharides, peptidoglycans, and polyphenols, among other compounds. Ginsenosides from the leaves and stem () is an approved over-the-counter medication in China. The indication is written in traditional Chinese medicine language.

===FDA warning letters===
As of 2019, the United States FDA and Federal Trade Commission have issued numerous warning letters to manufacturers of ginseng dietary supplements for making false claims of health or anti-disease benefits, stating that the &quot;products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the referenced uses&quot; and are illegal as unauthorized &quot;new drugs&quot; under federal law.

=== Animal feed ===
A tincture of Korean ginseng is approved by the EFSA for use in horses, dogs, and cats as a sensory additive (animal feed flavoring). Within the provided dose limits, the tincture is considered non-toxic.

A dried extract of Korean ginseng was declined by the EFSA, since its manufacturer cannot provide data on its complete composition.

== Safety and side effects ==
Ginseng supplements are not subjected to the same pre-market approval process in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as pharmaceutical drugs. FDA mandates that manufacturers must ensure the safety of their ginseng supplements before marketing, without the necessity to substantiate the safety and efficacy of these supplements in a pre-market scenario. Ginseng supplements can be complex, often containing multiple constituents. It is not uncommon to observe discrepancies between the ingredients listed on the product label and the actual components or their quantities present in the supplement. While manufacturers can employ independent organizations to authenticate the quality of a product or its ingredients, such verification does not equate to a certification of the product&#x27;s safety or effectiveness. These independent quality checks primarily focus on the integrity of the product in terms of its composition and do not extend to safety evaluations or purported clinical efficacy.

Ginseng generally has a good safety profile and the incidence of adverse effects is minor when used over the short term. The FDA has classified ginseng as &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot; (GRAS), indicating its general tolerability in adult populations.

The risk of interactions between ginseng and prescription medications is believed to be low, but ginseng may have adverse effects when used with blood thinners. Ginseng interacts with certain blood thinner medications, such as warfarin, leading to decreased blood levels of these drugs. Ginseng can also potentiate the effects of sedative medications. Concerns exist when ginseng is used over a longer term, potentially causing side effects such as skin rashes, headaches, insomnia, and digestive problems. The long-term use of ginseng may result in nervousness, anxiety, diarrhea, confusion, depression, or feelings of depersonalization, nausea, and fluctuations in blood pressure (including hypertension). There have been reports of gynecomastia and breast pain associated with ginseng use. Other side effects include breast pain and vaginal bleeding. As of 2023, there is a lack of data regarding the safety and efficacy of ginseng in lactating mothers and infants. Given its potential estrogenic activity and the absence of safety data during lactation, ginseng is not recommended for use during breastfeeding. Ginseng also has adverse drug reactions with phenelzine, and a potential interaction has been reported with imatinib, resulting in hepatotoxicity, and with lamotrigine.

=== Overdose ===
The common ginsengs (&quot;P. ginseng&quot; and &quot;P. quinquefolia&quot;) are generally considered to be relatively safe even in large amounts. One of the most common and characteristic symptoms of an acute overdose of &quot;P. ginseng&quot; is bleeding. Symptoms of mild overdose may include dry mouth and lips, excitation, fidgeting, irritability, tremor, palpitations, blurred vision, headache, insomnia, increased body temperature, increased blood pressure, edema, decreased appetite, dizziness, itching, eczema, early morning diarrhea, bleeding, and fatigue.

Symptoms of severe overdose with &quot;P. ginseng&quot; may include nausea, vomiting, irritability, restlessness, urinary and bowel incontinence, fever, increased blood pressure, increased respiration, decreased sensitivity and reaction to light, decreased heart rate, cyanotic (blue) facial complexion, red facial complexion, seizures, convulsions, and delirium.

== Terminology and etymology ==
The English word &quot;ginseng&quot; comes from the Teochew Chinese (; where this transliteration is in Pe̍h-ōe-jī). The first character (pinyin &quot;rén&quot;; or ) means &quot;person&quot; and the second character (; ) means &quot;plant root&quot; in a forked shape.

The Korean loanword insam comes from the cultivated ginseng (), which is less expensive than wild ginseng.

The botanical genus name &quot;Panax&quot;, meaning &quot;all-healing&quot; in Greek, shares the same origin as &quot;panacea&quot; and was applied to this genus because Carl Linnaeus was aware of its wide use in Chinese medicine as a muscle relaxant.

=== Other plants sometimes called ginseng ===
True ginseng plants belong only to the genus &quot;Panax&quot;. Several other plants are sometimes referred to as ginseng, but they are from a different genus or even family. Siberian ginseng is in the same family, but not genus, as true ginseng. The active compounds in Siberian ginseng are eleutherosides, not ginsenosides. Instead of a fleshy root, Siberian ginseng has a woody root.

<text>The Mariel boatlift () was a mass emigration of Cubans who traveled from Cuba&#x27;s Mariel Harbor to the United States between April 15 and October 31, 1980. The term &quot;&quot; is used to refer to these refugees in both Spanish and English. While the exodus was triggered by a sharp downturn in the Cuban economy, it followed on the heels of generations of Cubans who had immigrated to the United States in the preceding decades.

After 10,000 Cubans tried to gain asylum by taking refuge on the grounds of the Peruvian embassy, the Cuban government announced that anyone who wanted to leave could do so. The ensuing mass migration was organized by Cuban Americans, with the agreement of Cuban President Fidel Castro. The Cuban government considered the exodus a sort of social cleansing of the nations&#x27; so-called undesirables and organized acts of repudiation against prospective emigrants.

The arrival of the refugees in the United States created political problems for U.S. President Jimmy Carter. The Carter administration struggled to develop a consistent response to the immigrants. The Mariel boatlift was ended by mutual agreement between the two governments in late October 1980. By then, an estimated 125,000 Cubans had reached Florida.

==Background==
===Cuba–United States relations===

In the late 1970s, U.S. President Jimmy Carter sought to improve relations with Cuba. He lifted all restrictions on travel to Cuba, and in September 1977, both countries established an Interests Section in each other&#x27;s capital. However, relations were still strained because Cuba supported the Soviet Union&#x27;s military interventions in Africa and the Middle East with their own. The two countries struggled to reach agreement on a relaxation of the US embargo on trade to permit the export of a select list of medicines to Cuba without provoking Carter&#x27;s political opponents in the US Congress.

Ten members of Congress visited Cuba in December 1978, and the Cuban government later released Frank C. Emmick, the US manager of a business in Cuba who had been prevented from leaving in 1963, accused of being a CIA agent, and sentenced to 50 years in prison. A group of 55 people whose parents brought them from Cuba returned for three weeks in December 1978 in a rare instance of Cuba allowing the return of Cuban-born émigrés. In December 1978, both countries agreed upon their maritime border, and the next month, they were working on an agreement to improve their communications in the Straits of Florida. The US responded to Cuban relaxation of restrictions on emigration by allowing Cuban-Americans to send up to $500 to an emigrating relative (equal to $2,400 in 2023).

In November 1978, Castro&#x27;s government met in Havana with a group of Cubans living in exile, agreed to grant an amnesty to 3,600 political prisoners, and announced that they would be freed in the course of the next year and allowed to leave Cuba.

Caribbean Holidays began offering one-week trips to Cuba in January 1978 in co-operation with Cubatur, the official Cuban travel agency. By May 1979, tours were being organized for Americans to participate in the Cuban Festival of Arts (Carifesta) in July, with flights departing from Tampa, Mexico City, and Montreal.

===Haitian immigration to the United States===
Before 1980, many Haitian immigrants arrived on American shores by boat. They were not granted legal protection because they were considered economic migrants, rather than political refugees, despite claims made by many Haitians that they were being persecuted by the Duvalier regime. U.S. Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford denied claims of asylum in the United States for Haitian migrants by boat. A backlash by the Congressional Black Caucus ensued, which claimed that the U.S. government was discriminating against Haitian immigrants.

==Prelude==
===Rush to embassies in Cuba===

Several attempts by Cubans to seek asylum at the embassies of South American countries set the stage for the events of the spring of 1980. On 21 March 1978, two young Cuban writers who had been punished for dissent and denied permission to emigrate, Reynaldo Colas Pineda and Esteban Luis Cárdenas Junquera, unsuccessfully sought asylum in the Argentine embassy in Havana and were sentenced to two years in prison. On May 13, 1979, 12 Cubans sought to take asylum in the Venezuelan embassy in Havana by crashing their bus through a fence to gain entry to the grounds and the building. In January 1980, groups of asylum seekers took refuge in the Peruvian and Venezuelan embassies, and Venezuela called its ambassador home for consultations to protest that they had been fired on by the Cuban police. In March, Peru recalled its ambassador, who had denied entry to a dozen Cubans who were seeking asylum in his embassy.

The embassy invasions then became a confrontation between the Cuban government and the Havana embassies. A group of Cubans attempted to enter the Peruvian embassy in the last week of March, and on April 1, a group of six driving a city bus was successful in doing so, and a Cuban guard was killed by a ricocheting bullet. The Peruvians announced that they would not hand those who were seeking asylum over to Cuban police. The embassy grounds contained two 2-story buildings and gardens covering an area the size of a US football field, or 6,400 square yards The Cuban government announced on 4 April that it was withdrawing its security forces, who were normally officers from the Interior Ministry armed with automatic weapons, from that embassy: &quot;We cannot protect embassies that do not cooperate in their own protection.&quot; Following that announcement, about 50 Cubans entered the embassy grounds. By nightfall on April 5, that number had grown to 2,000, including many children and a few former political prisoners.

====Approval to emigrate====
Cuban officials announced through loudspeakers that anyone who had not entered the embassy grounds by force was free to emigrate if another country granted them entry. Peruvian President Francisco Morales had announced a willingness to accept asylum seekers. Diplomats from several countries met with the Peruvians to discuss the situation, including the crowd&#x27;s requirements of food and shelter. An official of the US State Department stated on April 5 that the country would both grant asylum to bona fide political prisoners and handle other requests to immigrate by following standard procedures, which provided for the issuance of 400 immigrant visas per month to Cubans, with preference given to those with family members who were already in the United States.

By April 6, the crowd had reached 10,000, and as sanitary conditions on the embassy grounds deteriorated, Cuban authorities prevented further access. The Cuban government called those seeking asylum &quot;bums, antisocial elements, delinquents, and trash.&quot; By April 8, 3,700 of the asylum-seekers had accepted safe-conduct passes to return to their homes, and the government began to provide shipments of food and water. Peru tried to organize an international relief program, and it won commitments first from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela to help with resettlement, and then from Spain, which agreed to accept 500. By April 11, the Cuban government began to furnish asylum seekers with documents that guaranteed their right to emigrate, including permanent safe-conduct passes and passports. In the first two days, about 3,000 received those papers and left the grounds. On 14 April, US President Jimmy Carter announced the US would accept 3,500 refugees and that Costa Rica had agreed to provide a staging area for screening potential immigrants.

====Emigration process and violence====

The Cuban government organized acts of repudiation against those who wished to leave the island. Mobs would sometimes beat their targets, force them to walk around with accusatory signs on their necks, or trash their homes. The emigrants were accused to be loafers, criminals, and drug addicts, and their expulsion was allegedly a kind of social cleansing. The physical assaults and verbal taunts that occurred during acts of repudiation were organized for months and created a sense of fear throughout Cuba. Many who participated in the violence did so to remain un-persecuted themselves, and some participants even left in the boatlift.

The Cuban government facilitated an emigration process that gave special privilege to those who were socially undesirable. People deemed homosexual would be allowed to leave the country. Those with gender non-conforming behavior were especially targeted by authorities for departure. Some of them were given the option between emigration and jail time, in order to encourage their departure from the island. Many Cubans would enter police stations and state that they engaged in homosexual behavior whether true or not, simply to be granted permission to leave the country.
===Concerns of Haitian refugees===
The Carter administration was negotiating the legal status of Haitian refugees as the Mariel boatlift began. As Cuban refugees began to arrive in the United States, a focus was put on the treatment of Haitian refugees, and Carter declared Haitian refugees and Cuban refugees would be accepted in the same manner. The United States would label all refugees that would come in during the Mariel boatlift as &quot;Cuban-Haitian entrants,&quot; to be approved at the discretion of the Attorney General.

==Exodus==
===Airlift from Cuba===
At first, emigrants were permitted to leave Cuba via flights to Costa Rica, followed by eventual relocation to countries that would accept them. After news coverage of celebratory masses of Cubans emigrating by flight to Costa Rica, the Cuban government declared that emigrants had to leave by flying directly to their accepting country; 7,500 Cubans left the country by those initial flights.

===Boatlift===
====Departure from Cuba and Haiti====
Castro stated ultimately on 20 April that the port of Mariel would be opened to anyone wishing to leave Cuba if they had someone to pick them up. Soon after Castro&#x27;s decree, many Cuban Americans began making arrangements to pick up refugees in the harbor. On April 21, the first boat from the harbor docked in Key West and held 48 refugees. By April 25 as many as 300 boats were picking up refugees in Mariel Harbor. Cuban officials also packed refugees into Cuban fishing vessels. Around 1,700 boats brought thousands of Cubans from Mariel to Florida between the months of April and October in that year.

Haitian refugees had been continuously coming to the United States before the Mariel boatlift and continued to do so with the flotilla.

====United States and Cuba policy changes====
After the arrival of thousands of refugees, Florida Governor Bob Graham declared a state of emergency in Monroe and Dade Counties on April 28. According to a US Coast Guard report, 15,761 refugees had arrived in Florida by early May. On May 6, Carter declared a state of emergency in the areas of Florida most &quot;severely affected&quot; by the exodus, and an open arms policy in which all refugees fleeing Cuba would receive temporary status. On June 20 the Cuban-Haitian Entrant Program was established, and Haitians would be given the same legal status as Cuban refugees in the United States during the Mariel boatlift. Around 25,000 Haitians would enter the United States during the boatlift.

In response, Carter then called for a blockade on the flotilla by the US Coast Guard. At least 1,400 boats would be seized, but many slipped by, and over 100,000 more Cuban and Haitian refugees continued to pour into Florida over the next five months. The Mariel Boatlift would end by agreement between the United States and Cuba in October 1980.

==Arrival==
===Miami===
Refugees were processed at camps set up in the greater Miami area, generally at decommissioned missile defense sites. Other sites were established at the Miami Orange Bowl and at various churches throughout the area. Some sites were established to segregate the refugees until they could be provided with initial processing at places such as the Nike–Hercules sites at Key Largo and Krome Avenue. Once they were initially processed and documented, the refugees were quickly transferred to larger compounds in the metropolitan area to allow them to be reunited with relatives who already lived in the United States and to allow interaction with various social-action agencies such as Catholic Charities and the American Red Cross. Regional resettlement facilities became crucial sites in the social and cultural negotiation of the status and desirability of Mariel Cubans.

As the Haitian refugees started arriving, interpreters were found to be in short supply for Haitian Creole, and interpreters from the local Haitian community were put under contract through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). As the end of the initial crisis period wound down and after the vetting of the refugees who could be sponsored had run its course, the decision was made to transfer the &quot;hard to sponsor&quot; refugees, which included those with criminal records, to longer-term processing sites at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas, Fort Indiantown Gap in Pennsylvania and Fort McCoy in Wisconsin.

====McDuffie riot====

During the Mariel boatlift the McDuffie riots were raging in the Liberty City and Overtown neighborhoods of Miami. It has been argued the riots were exacerbated by the diversion of social and policing resources from African-American communities to care for Mariel refugees, and the anger at the perceived privileges Cuban refugees held compared to African Americans and Haitian refugees.

==Processing==
===Dispersal to refugee camps===

Crowded conditions in South Florida immigration processing centers forced U.S. federal agencies to move many of the Marielitos to other centers in Fort Indiantown Gap; Fort McCoy; Camp Santiago, Puerto Rico; and Fort Chaffee. Federal civilian police agencies such as the General Services Administration&#x27;s Federal Protective Service provided officers to maintain order inside the gates of the relocation centers. Riots occurred at the Fort Chaffee center and some detainees escaped, an event that became a campaign issue in the re-election defeat of Governor Bill Clinton.

===Evolving legal status===

Most refugees were ordinary Cubans. Many had been allowed to leave Cuba for reasons that in the United States were loyalty-neutral or protected, such as tens of thousands were Seventh-Day Adventists or Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Some had been declared &quot;antisocialist&quot; in Cuba by their CDRs. In the end, only 2.2 percent (or 2,746) of the refugees were classified as serious or violent criminals under US law and denied citizenship on that basis.

In 1984, the Mariel refugees from Cuba received permanent legal status under a revision to the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966. Haitians were instead considered to be economic refugees, which made them unable to get the same residency status as Cubans and therefore subject to deportation. Two years later, under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, all Cuban-Haitian entrants who had immigrated in 1980 were able to apply for permanent residency.

By 1987, several hundred Marielitos were still detained because they were inadmissible under immigration law. Local police departments had also arrested around seven thousand Marielitos for felonies committed in the United States. Those arrested there served their prison sentences, only to be detained by INS as candidates for deportation.

The United States-Cuba Migration Agreement of 1987 allowed for 3,000 former political prisoners to emigrate to the United States and allowed for the deportation of undesired Marielitos. After news of the agreement broke, many detained Marielitos in Oakdale and Atlanta prisons rioted and took hostages. The riots ended after an agreement was reached to stop deportations until all detainees were given a fair review of their deportation case. After 1987, the United States would continue to deport Marielitos who were deemed undesirable.

===Later developments===
By June 2016, 478 remained to be deported; according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, some are elderly or sick, and the Department had no desire to send these back to Cuba. Under a 2016 agreement with the Cuban government, the U.S. will deport the final remaining migrants deemed as serious criminals.

==Aftermath==
===Task Force===
An early response to address the aftermath of the Mariel Boatlift was the 1983 City of Miami&#x27;s formation of the East Little Havana Task Force. Task Force members were appointed by the Miami City Commission, with urban planner and Cuban community leader Jesús Permuy named as its chair. It was tasked with studying the social and economic effects of the boatlift, particularly in Little Havana, which was an epicenter of the migration. The Task Force adjourned a year later and submitted its findings and official recommendations, called &quot;The East Little Havana Redevelopment Plan&quot;, to the Miami City Commission and Mayor&#x27;s Office in 1984.

===Effect on Miami crime===
At the time, the Immigration and Naturalization Service identified 1,306 migrants as having &quot;questionable&quot; backgrounds. Scholars have found that many Mariel immigrants with criminal records were incarcerated for minor crimes that would not be considered crimes in the US, such as selling goods in the black market. Estimates assert that the Cuban refugees included 2,700 hardened criminals.

A 1985 &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; magazine article claimed that out of the around 125,000 refugees that entered the United States, around 16,000 to 20,000 were estimated to be criminals. In a 1985 report around 350 to 400 Mariel Cubans were reported to inhabit Dade County jails on a typical day.

===Effect on Miami labor market===
About half of the Mariel immigrants decided to live in Miami permanently, which resulted in a 7 percent increase in workers in the Miami labor market and a 20 percent increase in the Cuban working population. Aside from the unemployment rate rising from 5.0 percent in April 1980 to 7.1 percent in July, the actual damage to the economy was marginal and followed trends across the United States at the time. When observing data from 1979 to 1985 on the Miami labor market and comparing it with similar data from several other major cities across the United States, focusing on wages, the effects of the boatlift were marginal. There have been several explanations offered for the findings by David Card. According to economist Ethan Lewis, the Miami labor market had already seen an increase in &quot;unskilled intensive manufactured goods,&quot; allowing it to offset the impact of the Cuban migrants. Miami also increased its diversity in manufacturing industries at a negligible rate compared to other US cities following the boat lift. According to data from the Annual Surveys of Manufacturers, Miami&#x27;s Manufacturing industries regressed only .01 percentage points post-1980, which indicates a minimal impact from the boat lift on the labor market. Miami also experienced a limited increased in skilled laborers after the boat lift. According to data from Lewis, Miami experienced limited change in workers who were literate in computer use, factoring out to a .010 percentage change in skilled laborers than in Card&#x27;s research.

The wages for White Americans remained steady in both Miami and comparable cities. The wage rates for African Americans were relatively steady from 1979 to 1985 when in comparable cities it dropped. Apart from a dip in 1983, wage rates for non-Cuban Hispanics were stable, while in comparable cities it fell approximately 6 percent. There is no evidence of a negative effect on wage rates for other groups of Hispanics in Miami. Wages for Cubans demonstrated a steady decline especially compared with other groups in Miami at the time. This can be attributed exclusively to the &quot;dilution&quot; of the group with the new, less-experienced, and lower-earning Mariel immigrants, meaning that there is also no evidence of a negative effect on wage rates for Cubans living in Miami prior to 1980.

The Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980 provided $100 million in cash and medical and social services and authorized approximately $5 million per year to facilitate the refugees&#x27; transition to American life. The 1980 Census was also adjusted to include Mariel children to ensure that additional assistance would be available to them through the Miami-Dade County Public Schools via Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).

====2016 reappraisal====
In 2016 Harvard economist George J. Borjas revisited David Card&#x27;s analysis in light of new insights into immigration effects since 1990. He used the same current population survey (CPS) data. However, he focused only on workers who were
* non-Hispanic (as the best approximation to the native-born)
* aged 25–59 (prime working age)
* male
* high-school dropouts
The last characteristic was especially important since 60 percent of Marielitos did not complete high school. And even many of the remaining 40 percent who had completed high school were looking for unskilled jobs because of their lack of linguistic and other skills. Marielitos, therefore, competed directly with high-school dropouts.

Borjas next compared the inflation-adjusted wages of Miami residents who had those characteristics with wages of the same segment of the American population in all other American metropolitan areas except Miami. His analysis shows that the Miami wages for native-born men without high-school diplomas were much lower than the wages for similar workers in other US metropolitan areas during the 1980s and then again in the late 1990s, following the two spikes of Cubans migrating to Miami.

One of his conclusions was that during the 1980s, wages in Miami were a full 20 percent lower than they were elsewhere. In 2017, an analysis of Borjas&#x27; study on the effects of the boatlift concluded that Borjas&#x27; findings &quot;may simply be spurious&quot; and that his theory of the economic impact of the boatlift &quot;doesn&#x27;t fit the evidence.&quot; A number of other studies concluded the opposite of what Borjas&#x27; study had found.

Writing for the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, the two economists Michael Clemens and Jennifer Hunt have claimed that conflicting results could be explained by the changes in the subsample composition of the CPS data. In 1980, the share of non-Hispanic blacks doubled in the subgroup of Miami male prime working-age high-school dropouts studied by Borjas. No similar increases occurred in the subgroups of populations in the control cities identified by either Card or Borjas. Since there was a large and significant difference between wages of black and nonblack high-school dropouts, the changing composition of the CSP subgroups created a spurious decline in the wages of the native population. According to Clemens and Hunt, the compositional effect accounts for the entire impact of the Mariel boatlift on the wages of native workers estimated by Borjas.

===Effect on political attitudes===

Fidel Castro stated that those leaving in the Mariel boatlift were undesirable members of Cuban society. With Castro&#x27;s condemnation and reports that prisoners and mental health patients were leaving in the exodus it was believed by some that Marielitos were undesirable deviants. Opponents of then U.S. President Jimmy Carter and the Democratic Party would hail the Mariel boatlift as a failure of his administration. Ronald Reagan would instead praise Marielitos in his ideological campaign against Cuba. The boatlift would also help spark policy demands for English-only government paperwork after Miami Dade County residents voted to remove Spanish as a second official language in November 1980. Former U.S. President Donald Trump&#x27;s senior policy adviser Stephen Miller used the boatlift as evidence of the dangers of unchecked immigration.

Initially, many Americans disapproved of the boatlift. According to a June 1980 poll conducted by CBS and the &quot;New York Times&quot;, 71% of Americans disapproved of the boatlift and allowing Cuban nationals to settle in the United States.

==In popular culture==
The boatlift has been the subject of a number of works of art, media, and entertainment. Examples include:

* &quot;Against Wind and Tide: A Cuban Odyssey&quot; (1981), a PBS documentary film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature 
* &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983), a dramatic film about a Marielito who becomes a drug lord. The film uses footage of the El Mariel coming to Miami.
* &quot;The Perez Family&quot;, a novel by Christine Bell; a group of Marielitos who share the same last name pretend to be a family
* &quot;The Perez Family&quot; (1995), a film based on the novel
