<text>Henry Gustav Molaison (February 26, 1926 – December 2, 2008), known widely as H.M., was an American who had a bilateral medial temporal lobectomy to surgically resect the anterior two thirds of his hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, entorhinal cortices, piriform cortices, and amygdalae in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. Although the surgery was partially successful in controlling his epilepsy, a severe side effect was that he became unable to form new memories. His unique case also helped define ethical standards in neurological research, emphasizing the need for patient consent and the consideration of long-term impacts of medical interventions. Furthermore, Molaison&#x27;s life after his surgery highlighted the challenges and adaptations required for living with significant memory impairments, serving as an important case study for healthcare professionals and caregivers dealing with similar conditions.
A childhood bicycle accident is often advanced as the likely cause of H.M.&#x27;s epilepsy. H.M. began to have minor seizures at age 10; from 16 years of age, the seizures became major. Despite high doses of anticonvulsant medication, H.M.&#x27;s seizures were incapacitating. When he was 27, H.M. was offered an experimental procedure by neurosurgeon William Beecher Scoville. Previously Scoville had only ever performed the surgery on psychotic patients.

The surgery took place in 1953 and H.M. was widely studied from late 1957 until his death in 2008. He resided in a care institute in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, where he was the subject of ongoing investigation. His case played an important role in the development of theories that explain the link between brain function and memory, and in the development of cognitive neuropsychology, a branch of psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the brain relates to specific psychological processes.

Molaison&#x27;s brain was kept at University of California, San Diego, where it was sliced into histological sections on December 4, 2009. It was later moved to the MIND Institute at UC Davis. The brain atlas constructed was made publicly available in 2014.

==Biography==
Henry Molaison was born on February 26, 1926, in Manchester, Connecticut, and experienced intractable epilepsy that has sometimes been attributed to a bicycle accident at the age of seven. He had minor or partial seizures for many years, and then major or tonic-clonic seizures following his 16th birthday. He worked for a time on an assembly line but, by the age of 27, he had become so incapacitated by his seizures, despite high doses of anticonvulsant medication, that he could not work nor lead a normal life.

In 1953, Molaison was referred to William Beecher Scoville, a neurosurgeon at Hartford Hospital. Scoville localized his epilepsy to the left and right medial temporal lobes (MTLs) and suggested their surgical resection. On September 1, 1953, Scoville removed Molaison&#x27;s medial temporal lobes on both hemispheres including the hippocampi and most of the amygdalae and entorhinal cortex, the major sensory input to the hippocampi. His hippocampi appeared entirely nonfunctional because the remaining 2 cm of hippocampal tissue appeared to have atrophied and some of his anterolateral temporal cortex was also destroyed.

After the surgery, which was partially successful in controlling his seizures, Molaison developed severe anterograde amnesia: although his working memory and procedural memory were intact, he could not commit new events to his explicit memory. According to some scientists, he was impaired in his ability to form new semantic knowledge.

Researchers argue over the extent of this impairment. He also had moderate retrograde amnesia, and could not remember most events in the one- to two-year period before surgery, nor some events up to 11 years before, meaning that his amnesia was temporally graded.

His case was first reported by Scoville and Brenda Milner in 1957, who referred to him by &quot;H.M.&quot; His full name was not revealed to the wider public until after his death. While researchers had told him of the significance of his condition and of his renown within the world of neurological research, he was unable to internalize such facts as memories.

Near the end of his life, Molaison regularly filled in crossword puzzles. He was able to fill in answers to clues that referred to pre-1953 knowledge. For post-1953 information he was able to modify old memories with new information. For instance, he could add a memory about Jonas Salk by modifying his memory of polio.

==Insights into memory formation==
Molaison was influential not only for the knowledge he provided about memory impairment and amnesia, but also because it was thought his exact brain surgery allowed a good understanding of how particular areas of the brain may be linked to specific processes hypothesized to occur in memory formation. In this way, his case was taken to provide information about brain pathology, and helped to form theories of normal memory function.

In particular, his apparent ability to complete tasks that require recall from short-term memory and procedural memory but not long-term episodic memory suggests that recall from these memory systems may be mediated, at least in part, by different areas of the brain. Similarly, his ability to recall long-term memories that existed well before his surgery, but inability to create new long-term memories, suggests that encoding and retrieval of long-term memory information may also be mediated by distinct systems.

Nevertheless, imaging of Molaison&#x27;s brain in the late 1990s revealed the extent of damage was more widespread than previous theories had accounted for, making it very hard to identify any one particular region or even isolated set of regions that were responsible for HM&#x27;s deficits.

==Contribution to science==
The study of Molaison revolutionized the understanding of the organization of human memory. It has provided broad evidence for the rejection of old theories and the formation of new theories on human memory, in particular about its processes and the underlying neural structures. In the following, some of the major insights are outlined.

Molaison&#x27;s brain was the subject of an anatomical study funded by the Dana Foundation and the National Science Foundation. The aim of the project, headed by Jacopo Annese, of The Brain Observatory at UC San Diego, was to provide a complete microscopic survey of the entire brain to reveal the neurological basis of Molaison&#x27;s historical memory impairment at cellular resolution. On December 4, 2009, Annese&#x27;s group acquired 2401 brain slices, with only two damaged slices and 16 potentially problematic slices. The digital 3D reconstruction of his brain was finished at the beginning of 2014.

The results of the study were published in Nature Communications for January 2014. The researchers found, to their surprise, that half of H.M.&#x27;s hippocampal tissue had survived the 1953 surgery, which has deep implications on past and future interpretations of H.M.&#x27;s neurobehavioral profile and of the previous literature describing H.M. as a &quot;pure&quot; hippocampus lesion patient. Additionally, a previously unexpected discrete lesion was discovered in the prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest revisiting raw data from behavioral testing. A three-dimensional virtual model of the brain allowed the dynamics of the surgery to be reconstructed; it was found that the brain damage above the left orbit could have been created by Dr. Scoville when he lifted the frontal lobe to reach into the medial temporal lobes.

The article also describes the general neuropathological state of the brain via multiple imaging modalities. As H.M. was 82 when he died, his brain had aged considerably. Several pathological features were discovered, some severe, which had contributed to his cognitive decline.

The digital atlas of HM&#x27;s brain was made publicly available on the Internet free of charge.

===Amnesia===

Molaison&#x27;s general condition has been described as heavy anterograde amnesia, as well as temporally graded retrograde amnesia. Since Molaison did not show any memory impairment before the surgery, the removal of the medial temporal lobes can be held responsible for his memory disorder. Consequently, the medial temporal lobes can be assumed to be a major component involved in the formation of semantic and episodic long-term memories (cf. medial temporal lobes described as a convergence zone for episodic encoding in Smith &amp; Kosslyn, 2007). Further evidence for this assumption has been gained by studies of other patients with lesions of their medial temporal lobe structures.

Despite his amnesic symptoms, Molaison performed quite normally in tests of intellectual ability, indicating that some memory functions (e.g., short-term memories, stores for words, phonemes, etc.) were not impaired by the surgery. However, for sentence-level language comprehension and production, Molaison exhibited the same deficits and sparing as in memory. Molaison was able to remember information over short intervals of time. This was tested in a working memory experiment involving the recall of previously presented numbers; in fact, his performance was no worse than that of control subjects (Smith &amp; Kosslyn, 2007). This finding provides evidence that working memory does not rely on medial temporal structures. Molaison&#x27;s largely intact word retrieval provides evidence that lexical memory is independent of the medial temporal structures.

===Motor skill learning===

In addition to his intact working memory and intellectual abilities, studies of Molaison&#x27;s ability to acquire new motor skills contributed to a demonstrated preserved motor learning (Corkin, 2002). In a study conducted by Milner in the early 1960s, Molaison acquired the new skill of drawing a figure by looking at its reflection in a mirror (Corkin, 2002). Specifically, H.M. was asked to trace a 3rd star in the narrow space between 2 concentric stars while only looking at a reflection of his paper and pencil in a mirror. Like most people performing this task for the first time, he did not do well and went outside the lines about 30 times. Milner had him do this task 10 times on each day and saw that the number of errors he made went down for each trial after the first. H.M. made about 20 errors on the second trial, 12 errors on the third, and by the 10th trial on the first day he only made about 5-6 errors. Each time H.M. performed the task, he improved even though he had no memory of the previous attempts or of ever doing the task. On the second day, he made significantly fewer errors for each trial on average, and on the third day he made almost no errors for each trial. Milner concluded that the unconscious motor centers and parts of the brain responsible for procedural implicit memory such as the basal ganglia and cerebellum can remember things that the conscious mind has forgotten. These structures were intact in H.M.’s brain, and thus he was able to do well on this task after repeated trials. 

Further evidence for intact motor learning was provided in a study carried out by Corkin (1968). In this study, Molaison was tested on three motor learning tasks and demonstrated full motor learning abilities in all of them.

Experiments involving repetition priming underscored Molaison&#x27;s ability to acquire implicit (non-conscious) memories, in contrast to his inability to acquire new explicit semantic and episodic memories (Corkin, 2002). These findings provide evidence that memory of skills and repetition priming rely on different neural structures than memories of episodes and facts; whereas procedural memory and repetition priming do not rely on the medial temporal structures removed from Molaison, semantic and episodic memory do (cf. Corkin, 1984).

The dissociation of Molaison&#x27;s implicit and explicit learning abilities along their underlying neural structures has served as an important contribution to our understanding of human memory: Long-term memories are not unitary and can be differentiated as being either declarative or non-declarative (Smith &amp; Kosslyn, 2007).

===Spatial memory===

According to Corkin (2002), studies of Molaison&#x27;s memory abilities have also provided insights regarding the neural structures responsible for spatial memory and processing of spatial information. Despite his general inability to form new episodic or factual long-term memories, as well as his heavy impairment on certain spatial memory tests, Molaison was able to draw a quite detailed map of the topographical layout of his residence. This finding is remarkable since Molaison had moved to the house five years after his surgery and hence, given his severe anterograde amnesia and insights from other cases, the common expectation was that the acquisition of topographical memories would have been impaired as well. Corkin (2002) hypothesized that Molaison &quot;was able to construct a cognitive map of the spatial layout of his house as the result of daily locomotion from room to room&quot; (p. 156).

Regarding the underlying neural structures, Corkin (2002) argues that Molaison&#x27;s ability to acquire the floor plan is due to partly intact structures of his spatial processing network (e.g., the posterior part of his parahippocampal gyrus). In addition to his topographical memory, Molaison showed some learning in a picture memorization-recognition task, as well as in a famous faces recognition test, but in the latter only when he was provided with a phonemic cue. Molaison&#x27;s positive performance in the picture recognition task might be due to spared parts of his ventral perirhinal cortex.

Furthermore, Corkin (2002) argues that despite Molaison&#x27;s general inability to form new declarative memories, he seemed to be able to acquire small and impoverished pieces of information regarding public life (e.g., cued retrieval of celebrities&#x27; names). These findings underscore the importance of Molaison&#x27;s spared extrahippocampal sites in semantic and recognition memory and enhance our understanding of the interrelations between the different medial temporal lobe structures. Molaison&#x27;s heavy impairment in certain spatial tasks provides further evidence for the association of the hippocampi with spatial memory.

===Memory consolidation===
Another contribution of Molaison to understanding of human memory regards the neural structures of the memory consolidation process, which is responsible for forming stable long-term memories (Eysenck &amp; Keane, 2005). Molaison displayed a temporally graded retrograde amnesia in the way that he &quot;could still recall childhood memories, but he had difficulty remembering events that happened during the years immediately preceding the surgery&quot;. His old memories were not impaired, whereas the ones relatively close to the surgery were. This is evidence that the older childhood memories do not rely on the medial temporal lobe, whereas the more recent long-term memories seem to do so. The medial temporal structures, which were removed in the surgery, are hypothesized to be involved in the consolidation of memories in the way that &quot;interactions between the medial temporal lobe and various lateral cortical regions are thought to store memories outside the medial temporal lobes by slowly forming direct links between the cortical representations of the experience&quot;.

==Post-death controversy==
On August 7, 2016, a &quot;New York Times&quot; article written by Luke Dittrich, grandson of Molaison&#x27;s neurosurgeon William Beecher Scoville, raised a number of concerns about how Molaison&#x27;s data and consent process had been conducted by the primary scientist investigating him, Suzanne Corkin. The article suggested that Corkin had destroyed research documents and data, and failed to obtain consent from Molaison&#x27;s closest living kin. In response to the article, a group of over 200 leading neuroscientists signed a public letter arguing that the article was biased and misleading, and MIT published a rebuttal of some of the allegations in Dittrich&#x27;s article. This was in turn rebutted by Dittrich, who provided a recording of the interview with Corkin, where she said she had destroyed large amounts of data and files specifically related to H.M. A second rebuttal was issued on 20 of August 2016 responding to the criticism leveled against Corkin, including the fact that in this same recorded interview Corkin says that when moving lab locations in the past, other files and data had been discarded, while temporarily “We kept the H.M. stuff”.

Psychologist Stuart Vyse writes about this controversy and the action of the two hundred scientists who responded to criticism of Corkin. Vyse states that in their rush to defend Corkin they risked their credibility and authority &quot;by weighing in on subjects outside their circle of knowledge&quot;. The &quot;signers responded very quickly&quot; only two days after the release of the NYT article, they were not aware of the &quot;specific claims of bias&quot; and very few of the signers &quot;could have had relevant knowledge of the facts&quot;. Consensus of the science is important, but the consensus should be based on actual knowledge of the subject and not as a reaction to &quot;come to the defense of a beloved colleague&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Baxendale (2004) cites Molaison&#x27;s life as a partial inspiration for Christopher Nolan&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;Memento&quot;, the influence of which led to its realistic portrayal of anterograde amnesia.

<text>Kuwait International Airport (, ) is an international airport located in the Farwaniya Governorate, Kuwait, south of the centre of Kuwait City, spread over an area of . It serves as the primary hub for Kuwait Airways and Jazeera Airways. A portion of the airport complex is designated as Abdullah Al-Mubarak Air Base, which contains the headquarters of the Kuwait Air Force, as well as the Kuwait Air Force Museum.

==History==
The airport was first launched in 1927–1928. It was originally envisioned as a stop for British planes on their way to British India. The current main airport structure, designed by Kenzo Tange and opened in 1979, was executed and completed by Al Hani Construction in a joint venture with Ballast Nedam of The Netherlands.

On February 27, 1991, during the final days of the Gulf War, in part of the liberation of Kuwait, the airport became the scene of a tank battle between Iraqi forces and elements of the U.S. Army Special Forces.

The airport underwent a large renovation and expansion project from 1999 to 2001, in which the former parking lot was cleared and a terminal expansion was built.

Kuwait International Airport can currently handle more than 13 million passengers a year. A new general aviation terminal was completed in 2008 under a BOT scheme and is operated by Royal Aviation.

In 2011, the Department of Civil Aviation announced the intention of extending Kuwait International Airport so it can handle more passengers and more aircraft. On October 3, 2011, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation announced that a new Foster + Partners designed terminal will begin construction in 2012 and will increase the annual passenger handling amount to 14 million passengers in its first phase with the option of expanding to 25 million passengers. The airport finalized formalities for the construction of the terminal, which was due to begin construction in 2012 with completion by 2016. It would be built to the south of the current terminal complex with new access routes from the Seventh Ring Road to the south of the airport compound. It is designed as a three-pointed star, with each point extending 600 meters from the star&#x27;s center. Two airside hotels will form part of the new building.

In December 2012, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Public Works announced that the new Terminal at the Kuwait International Airport would be completed by the end of 2016, estimating the cost to be around 900 million Kuwaiti dinar ($3.2 billion). On May 20, 2013, the Director of Operations Management in the General Administration of Civil Aviation, Essam Al-Zamil, announced that some of the flights will be diverted to the Sheikh Saad Terminal instead of Kuwait Airport&#x27;s main terminal starting in July due to the large number of passengers and the growing number of aircraft attributing to Kuwait Airport being over capacity.

On May 22, 2018, Jazeera Airways launched its own dedicated terminal at Kuwait International Airport, to be called Terminal 5. It is located directly adjacent to and connected to the existing main building, but features dedicated arrival/departure areas, customs and all supporting functions in order to alleviate congestion at the main building. All Jazeera arrivals will arrive at the new terminal from opening, while departing flights will transition from the current terminal between May 22 and May 27. By May 27, all departing and arriving Jazeera flights will be handled exclusively at Terminal 5.

On August 8, 2018, Terminal 4 was inaugurated to cater to all flights operated by Kuwait&#x27;s national carrier, Kuwait Airways. Terminal 4 can handle 4.5 million passengers annually and eases congestion at Terminal 1. There are 2,450 additional car parking spaces in a dedicated surface lot adjacent to the terminal and connected to the building by a bridge.

From 13 March to 1 August 2020, all commercial flights at Kuwait International Airport were suspended as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Military==
The airport is home to the Abdullah Al-Mubarak Air Base, which is used by the Kuwait Air Force and has been used by Italian Air Force Boeing KC-767s since October 2014 for the fight against ISIL. The gateway at Abdullah Al-Mubarak Air Base, used by US Air Force and coalition forces, was replaced after over 20 years of operation in 2019 with the opening of Cargo City, located adjacent to a newly built ramp on the airport&#x27;s western side. Cargo City is operated by the 387th Air Expeditionary Group, with the 5th Expeditionary Air Mobility Squadron providing additional services like maintenance for military and contract flights.

==Facilities==
The airport lies at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has two runways: 15R/33L with a concrete surface measuring and 15L/33R with an asphalt surface measuring .

==Terminals==
Kuwait International Airport will have five operational, numbered terminals by 2025 to 2026

===Terminal 1===
Terminal 1, designed by Kenzo Tange, is the primary building at Kuwait International Airport and houses most arriving and departing flights other than those operated by Jazeera Airways, Etihad, Emirates and flydubai, which operate out of the other terminals; it has 16 gates. The terminal also houses restaurants, duty-free shops, security checkpoints, and four lounges.

===Terminal 2===
Terminal 2, designed by Foster and Partners, will expand the airport&#x27;s overall capacity by 25–50 million passengers per year through the introduction of a triangular building with 28 gates, 4,500 additional parking spaces and a 400-bed air-side hotel. It began construction in May 2017 and was due for completion in August 2022, but was initially delayed to 2024 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following further delays, the new target operation date for T2 is set for 2025 or 2026.

The new terminal is environmentally sustainable, and aims to achieve LEED Gold certification. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest environment friendly airport projects, and forms an essential part of Kuwait Vision 2035.

===Terminal 3===
Originally named the Sheikh Saad General Aviation Terminal and conceived for use by private aircraft, Terminal 3 is a small building that was used exclusively by Aegean Airlines and flydubai before being shut down due to work in Terminal 2.

===Terminal 4===

Inaugurated on 8 August 2018, Terminal 4 is used by all flights operated by Kuwait&#x27;s national carrier, Kuwait Airways. The building was designed by the Spanish branch of the American company AECOM and built by a joint venture between Cengiz Insaat and First Kuwaiti Contractor. It is housed in a dedicated building neighboring the cargo-handling facilities on the airport compound and built over an area of 55,000 square meters. It offers five bus gates and nine boarding bridges gates, with a capacity of eight planes at the same time. Terminal 4 can handle 4.5 million passengers annually and eases congestion at Terminal 1. There are 2,450 additional car parking spaces in a dedicated surface lot adjacent to the terminal and connected to the building by a bridge.

===Terminal 5===
Inaugurated in May 2018, Terminal 5 is exclusively used by Kuwait-based budget airline Jazeera Airways. Attached to Terminal 1 but with dedicated entrance/exit points, it also includes check-in zones, security checkpoints, lounges, shops, three departure gates, customs and arrival belts. It additionally offers 350 parking spaces in a multi-story facility attached to Terminal 5 by a bridge.

<text>Shakkazombie (シャカゾンビ) is a Japanese hip-hop group. Formed in the 1990s, the group consists of Osumi a.k.a. Big-O (Takeshi Osumi), Hide-Bowie a.k.a. Ignition Man (Hidehiro Iguchi), and Tsutchie (Shinji Tsuchida). One of Japan&#x27;s influential hip-hop groups, they are known for featuring &amp; introducing many artists in their collaborations such as Nitro Microphone Underground.

==History==
The group was formed in 1993 when DJ &amp; producer Tsutchie joined with emcees Osumi and Hide-Bowie, who were already making hip-hop music at the time. Hide-Bowie played jazz music before becoming a hip-hop artist and both he and Osumi were influenced by the hip-hop lifestyle. In his first year of high school, Tsutchie was inspired by hip-hop acts such as Run DMC and the Beastie Boys which lead to him becoming a beatmaker.

In 1995, Shakkazombie released their debut single &quot;Shakkattack&quot;. They later formed the Ookami Crew collective with Japanese hip-hop group Buddha Brand, releasing the single &quot;&quot; in 1996. On July 7, 1996, the group along with Buddha Brand, Rhymester, Muro, YOU THE ROCK★, King Giddra, Soul Scream, and several Japanese hip-hop artists took part in the hip-hop concert &amp; festival Thumpin Camp at the Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall in Tokyo, Japan. Organized by Japanese rapper ECD, the event was later made into a hip-hop documentary similar to the 1995 American hip-hop documentary &quot;The Show&quot; and a soundtrack was released with Shakkazombie, ECD, Buddha Brand, YOU THE ROCK★, K DUB SHINE of King Giddra, DJ/production duo FORCE OF NATURE, and other artists.

In July 1997, the group released their first full-length album &quot;Hero The S.Z.&quot; The album included guest artists Nitro Microphone Underground and DJ Hazime. The song &quot;&quot; was featured during the end credits of &quot;Session XX: Yose Atsume Blues&quot; of the anime series &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;. The episode was only aired once in Japan and the song was never featured in any of the official &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; soundtracks.

In December 1998, Osumi would release his first solo album &quot;Control (The Spiritual Matters)&quot;. Along with his Shakkazombie bandmates, the album featured production by DJ Watarai, Go Go King Recorders, and Dev Large of Buddha Brand with guest appearances by DJ Ohkubo, MACKA-CHIN of Nitro Microphone Underground, Keita &quot;Cro-Ovi&quot; Ishiguro of the hip-hop group Kimidori, Dejja, and Tina. Hide-Bowie, under his new moniker of Ignition Man, was featured on the song &quot;Unsigned Hype&quot; while Tsutchie produced &quot;No Limit (Tsutchie Remix)&quot;.

In July 1999, the group released the EP &quot;Big Blue&quot; and their second album &quot;Journey Of Foresight&quot;. Released on July 23, &quot;Journey Of Foresight&quot; included guest appearances by Suiken, XBS, and Dabo of Nitro Microphone Underground, Lori Fine of the band COLDFEET, DJ/producer Illicit Tsuboi, and pianist Saiko Tsukamoto. The song &quot;&quot; off the &quot;Big Blue&quot; EP, a remake of Kimidori&#x27;s 1993 song of the same name, was known in the West after the track was used in a fan anime music video of &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; and &quot;Trigun&quot; for the 2001 Anime Expo entitled &quot;Tainted Donuts&quot;. Osumi would later join Dev Large, Suiken &amp; hip-hop duo Lunch Time Speax as the group God Inc and released the single &quot;El Dorado Throw Down&quot;.

On February 23, 2000, the group released the compilation album &quot;S-Sence 2000&quot; featuring several remixes by artists such as DJ Spinna, Master Low, Ropes, D.O.I., Japanese punk band Brahman, DJ Hazime, DJ Watarai, 4Hero, and FORCE OF NATURE.

On June 27, 2001, the group released the EP &quot;Get On Da Track&quot;. The mini album featured guest appearances by S-Word of Nitro Microphone Underground, emcee Nipps of Buddha Brand, and violinist/cellist Chieko Kinbara. The album also featured remixes of &quot;&quot; by American hip-hop producer Jay Dee a.k.a. J. Dilla of the hip-hop group Slum Village, &quot;Right Here&quot; by DJ Watarai, &quot;First Tour&quot; by DJ Takeshi Kubota of Kimidori, and &quot;Get Yourself Arrested (W.E. In The U.S. Are In Trouble Mix)&quot; by Tim Kinsella in a collaboration with Japanese rock band Northern Bright.

On March 27, 2002, the group released their third album &quot;The Goodfellaz&quot;. Along with appearances from members Suiken, Deli, and Dabo of Nitro Microphone Underground and DJ Hazime, the album featured appearances by P.H. Fron, Kashi Da Handsome, Lunch Time Speax, hip-hop group Gasboys, and singer Michico. This would be the group&#x27;s last studio album. Osumi and Tsutchie pursued solo careers while Ignition Man made appearances on other projects before stepping away from music. Tsutchie released the solo albums &quot;Thanks For Listening&quot; in 2002 and &quot;This Is A Recording&quot; in 2003. Osumi released his second album &quot;Straight To Next Door&quot; with DJ Watarai and made guest appearances before taking a hiatus.

On June 25, 2015, Shakkazombie reformed and the group performed &quot;&quot; at &quot;D.L Presents HUSTLERS CONVENTION NIGHT&quot;, a memorial event for late Buddha Brand member Dev Large.

On January 24, 2021, Osumi passed away at the age of 47, due to complications with sepsis.

==Other projects==
In 1999, Osumi and Ignition Man started a men&#x27;s fashion line named SWAGGER, originally promoting the brand via the Shakkazombie website and later expanding to several flagship retail stores in Tokyo, goods being sold in several cities outside of Japan, and an online presence with Japanese streetwear retail site ZOZOTOWN. SWAGGER included the SWG Black Platinum label as a subline and collaborated with brands such as The Timberland Company, The North Face, Nike, Inc., Ray-Ban, Schott NYC, New Era Cap Company and Levi Strauss &amp; Co. In 2012, SWAGGER collaborated with famed American photographer Ricky Powell to create a capsule collection based on Powell&#x27;s photos of hip-hop artists LL Cool J and The Beastie Boys. SWAGGER has also released collaborations with the Wu-Tang Clan and Nas.

Osumi would later start another line of men&#x27;s apparel with a luxury emphasis named PHENOMENON in 2004, which branched off into women&#x27;s apparel. After filing for bankruptcy in 2013, Osumi ended the PHENOMEMON line in 2015. Osumi and design partner Yuichi Yoshii founded the men&#x27;s clothing line MISTERGENTLEMAN in 2012 and became directors of the Tokyo-based record store WAVE at Roppongi Hills in 2017. Osumi was also the chief men&#x27;s designer for Mash Holdings, which included the brands Gelato Pique and Snidel. In 2018, DJ and producer Shinichi Osawa a.k.a. Mondo Grosso would collaborate with Osumi for the song &quot;One Temperature&quot;, Osumi&#x27;s first work as an emcee in over ten years. Before his passing, Osumi worked on his final collection, the MISTERGENTLEMAN FALL WINTER 2021-22 Collection, which will be presented by the brand in memory of his passing at Rakuten Fashion Week Tokyo in March 2021. 

Before his hiatus from music, Ignition Man appeared on the track &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Gone&quot; with Osumi on the album &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Stoppin&#x27; The DJ&quot; by DJ Hazime. He was also featured on the tracks &quot;Alcoholic Drive&quot; and posse cut &quot;Planet of The Bapes&quot; on the albums &quot;Nigo (B)ape Sounds&quot; by Nigo, &quot;(B)ape Sounds Mixtape&quot; by DJ Kent of FORCE OF NATURE, and &quot;(B)Ape Sounds Mixtape [11Monkeys Liquidwebb Mix]&quot; by Cipha Sounds in 2004. The three albums were released by Ape Sounds Records, a subsidiary of Nigo&#x27;s clothing brand A Bathing Ape. In 2012 and nine years after his retirement, Ignition Man would make a guest appearance on the song &quot;The Sound Distillation&quot; by Japanese rock band BACK DROP BOMB for their album &quot;The Ocracy&quot;. After the end of the SWAGGER line, Ignition Man founded the fashion brand KAKOI in May of 2017, specializing in hats and apparel.

In addition to his work with Shakkazombie, Tsutchie has done production work and remixes for other artists such as YOU THE ROCK★, ECD, Tomoe Shinohara, Dabo, Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her, Kahimi Karie, Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra, Da Pump, Cymbals, Heartsdales, and Miliyah Kato. He has also worked on anime productions such as being part of the production team behind the music of &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot;, being a featured artist on the &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot; soundtrack albums, and creating the musical score &amp; soundtrack album for &quot;GANGSTA&quot;. Tsutchie has also been involved in a number of collaborative efforts with other artists and a notable example is the duo Ravolta (ラヴォルタ), consisting of Tsutchie handling the production and Aiha Higurashi of Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her on vocals. Tsutchie was also involved in the collaborative project Suite Chic, which included Japanese R&amp;B and hip-hop artists such as Namie Amuro, Ai, Dabo, Muro, Verbal of m-flo, and Zeebra.

<doc id="464427" wikidata="Q3564227" url="?curid=464427" title="Auditor General of Canada">
<text>The Auditor General of Canada (French: La vérificatrice générale du Canada) is a Supreme audit institution which acts as an officer to the Parliament of Canada tasked with highlighting accountability and oversight by conducting independent financial audits of federal government&#x27;s operations. These performance audits, known as the Auditor-General&#x27;s Report provide members of parliament with objective evidence to help them examine the government&#x27;s activities and hold it to account and improve good governance among public officers included.

Karen Hogan was appointed Auditor General of Canada in June 2020. She replaced interim Auditor General of Canada Sylvain Ricard.

== Office ==
Auditors general are appointed by the governor general in council (cabinet) on advice of the House of Commons and Senate for a non-renewable term of ten years. An auditor general may only be removed for cause by the governor-in-council with the approval of both the House of Commons and Senate. The Oversight and Accountability (a/k/a the Federal Accountability Act) and Auditor General Act gives this body substantial independence from both cabinet and Head of Government control.

The auditor general&#x27;s responsibilities include:

* auditing operations of the federal and territorial governments
* providing Parliament and the legislative assemblies with independent information, assurance, and advice regarding the stewardship of public funds

On November 4, 2011, the prime minister appointed Michael Ferguson, former Auditor General of the province of New Brunswick, as Auditor General of Canada, effective November 28, 2011. Sylvain Ricard, having been previously the deputy auditor general, was appointed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on March 29, 2019, to serve until a permanent replacement was selected.

The Office of the Auditor General of Canada was named one of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Top 100 Employers&quot; by Mediacorp Canada Inc. five years in a row (2008–2012), and was featured in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; newsmagazine.

The commissioner of the environment and sustainable development, was created by Parliament in 1995 as an aide to the AGC, and has offices within the precinct of the AGC. The commissioner is empowered under the 1995 amendments to the Auditor-General Act to receive &quot;petitions on environmental and sustainable development matters and [to] require ministers to respond to them&quot;. The petition process requires the ministry to respond in 120 days, although the process may be delayed by litigation.

The Office of the Auditor General of Canada is located in the C.D. Howe Building in Ottawa.

== History ==
The role of auditor general was introduced in 1878 and prior to the creation it was the head of the audit board (1867–1878).

In 1971, the auditor general&#x27;s office hosted VII INCOSAI, the seventh triennial convention of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions.

<doc id="464429" wikidata="Q5155705" url="?curid=464429" title="Comparison of Canadian and American economies">
<text>The economies of Canada and the United States are similar because both are developed countries. While both countries feature in the top ten economies in the world in 2022, the U.S. is the largest economy in the world, with US$24.8 trillion, with Canada ranking ninth at US$2.2 trillion. 

==Overview==

This article compares the economies of Canada and the United States based on GDP, debt-to-GDP ratio, inflation, unemployment, public debt, taxation, and purchasing power parity.

In 2024 the population of Canada was estimated to be 40,784,365 (Q1, 2024) compared to 36,991,981 in 2021 while the population of the United States was estimated to 339,268,209 in Q1 2024, more than eight times larger than Canada.

The United States GDP was $24.8 trillion in 2021. The United States has the largest economy globally and Canada ranks 9th at US$2.015 trillion. 

The US share of the global market economy estimated at US$79.98 trillion, was c. 25% in 2018, which is down from 35% in 2005. China&#x27;s global e-commerce market share has grown rapidly from less than 1% in c. 1998 to 42% in 2018. China now has second largest economy in the world with a value of US$14 trillion.
In 2024 the Canada&#x27;s General government gross debt-to-GDP ratio was 106%, compared to the United States at 121 %.
According to the IMF&#x27;s 2018 annual Article IV Mission to Canada, compared to all the G7 countries, including the United States, Canada&#x27;s &quot;total government net debt-to-GDP ratio&quot;, is the lowest. Canada has been the G7 leader in economic growth since 2016. The unemployment rate in Canada is at its lowest level since c.1978. Over 600,000 full-time jobs have been created in Canada since early 2016.

The IMF&#x27;s 2018 annual Article IV Mission to the United States reported that, &quot;Unemployment is low, inflation is well contained, and growth is set to accelerate. During the course of this administration, the economy is expected to enter the longest expansion in recorded U.S. history.&quot; Topics covered include competition, debt, sustainability analysis, economic indicators, fiscal policy, fiscal sustainability, monetary policy, tax policy and trade policy.

The International Monetary Fund&#x27;s annual World Economic Outlook provides the main economic indicators in Canada in selected years between 1980 and 2017. Inflation under 2% is in green.
In 2016 the GDP per capita in Canada was compared to in the US.

This table show the same economic indicators in the United States in selected years between 1980 and 2017. Inflation under 2% is in green.

==International trade==
Canada and the United States are member states of international trade organizations, including NAFTA—replaced by the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) negotiated in 2018, G7, G20, OECD and WTO.

According to a Global Affairs Canada 2018 report, Canada&#x27;s exports increased 5.7% to a record high in 2017 of $CAD546.7 billion—$29.2 billion above the exports level in 2016. In 2017 imports also rose to an all-time high of $CAD1,108 billion. In 2017, Canada&#x27;s exports increased to Japan, India, South Korea, Germany, the United Kingdom, and China. In September 2017, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) came into force. In March 2018, Canada signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). In October 2018, Canada, Mexico and the United States negotiated the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) to replace NAFTA. In October 2017, Canada began new free trade negotiations with the Pacific Alliance Latin America trade bloc—formed by Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, and in March 2018 with the Mercosur South American member countries.

According to Statscan, Canada&#x27;s trade deficit shrank to CAN$416 million (US$318 million) in September 2018.

According to the August 2018 International Trade Compliance (ITC) report, in 2017, US merchandise exports increased $95.7 billion or 6.6% from $1,451.0 billion in 2016 to $1,546.7 billion. During the same period, US imports increased by $155.1 billion or 7.1% up from $2,187.8 billion in 2016. In 2017 energy-related products represented the largest increase in both imports and exports in the US.

== Purchasing power parity ==
Based on a purchasing power parity scale, which compares the &quot;relative purchasing power between two or more currencies&quot;,—income levels and costs are used to calculate the difference in the affordability of a similar basket of goods—in 2014, Canada was rated as 26% more expensive than the US. According to a Statistics Canada report released in 2017, the purchasing power parity (PPP) for gross domestic income was US$0.84 per Canadian dollar. Comparable items cost one dollar in Canada compared to 84 cents in the United States. Since 1999, the PPP had been &quot;relatively stable&quot;. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) tracks price comparisons for industrialized countries, and in June 2015 Canada was listed as 6% more expensive than the United States, when the US dollar was used as the reference currency.

Although wealth is more highly concentrated in the US, the median (50th percentile) worker has about 23% more purchasing power as well. In terms of purchasing power parity, the most recent statistics from the IMF has Canada (US$35,494) lower than that in the United States (US$43,444).

==Debt-to-GDP ratio==

The OECD tracks member countries debt-to-GDP ratio, the &quot;amount of a country&#x27;s total gross government debt as a percentage of its GDP&quot;, as an &quot;indicator of an economy&#x27;s health and a key factor for the sustainability of government finance.&quot;

This compares United States public debt and Canadian public debt based on data from the CIA&#x27;s World Factbook and the IMF.

According to the Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau in his February 27, 2018 presentation of the Canadian federal budget for the fiscal year 2018–2019, the deficit was projected to be CDN$18.1 billion.

According to the Fraser Institute, government spending at all levels (federal, state/provincial and local) has traditionally been higher in Canada than the United States.

==Taxation==
===Personal income taxes===
According to the OECD&#x27;s report entitled &quot;Taxing Wages 2018&quot; in 2017, the &quot;employee net average tax rate for a single person in Canada with no children was 22.8%, compared to 26.1% in the United States. Canada placed &quot;11th lowest among 35 OECD countries&quot;. The OECD &quot;estimates take into account federal and provincial or state taxes, as well as social security contributions and money returned in the form of family benefits&quot;.

In 2016, Canada&#x27;s tax revenue to GDP ratio was 31.7% ranking 24th out of 35 OECD countries, compared to the US at 26% ranking at 30th, according to the OECD.

===Corporate taxes===
According to a table updated to January 2018, produced by the Netherlands-based KPMG, one of the world&#x27;s Big Four auditors, the corporate tax rate in Canada was 26.50% compared to 27% in the United States.

KPMG calculated the Canadian corporate tax by adding the federal and provincial tax components. The federal component is 15%. Each of the ten provinces and three territories have 2 different tax rates, one which is lower for small businesses which ranges from 0 to 4.5%, and higher for all other corporations, which ranges from 11.5 to 16%. Combined with the federal tax component the total can vary from 26.5% to 31%.

According to KPMG, the US federal corporate income tax rate was 21% for &quot;taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017&quot;. As well, &quot;[m]ost state and many local governments impose net income taxes&quot; with the &quot;top marginal rate generally rang[ing] from 0% to 12%&quot;. The &quot;mean of the top state tax rates [was] roughly 7.5%.&quot; &quot;[M]any states and localities impose gross receipts taxes, capital-based taxes, and other taxes that are not reflected in the rates provided&quot;. A corporation may deduct its state and local income tax expense when computing its federal taxable income, generally resulting in a net effective rate of approximately 27%.&quot;

==Unemployment==
In 2017, the unemployment rate in Canada was 6.3%, compared to 4.4% unemployment rate in the United States. From November 2017 through October 2018, Canada&#x27;s unemployment ranged from 5.8% to 6.0%.

In Canada in October 2018, 11,200 new full-time jobs were added, lowering the unemployment rate to 5.8%—a &quot;40-year low, underpinning expectations that the Bank of Canada would keep raising interest rates&quot;. However, the &quot;labor participation rate fell to its lowest point since October 1998—65.2%.

The US government counts the &quot;unemployed&quot; as &quot;people who don’t have a job&quot; but have &quot;actively looked for one in the previous four weeks, and are available for work.&quot; A 2018 &quot;Bloomberg&quot; article described the &quot;disguised unemployed&quot;, including workers described as &quot;marginally attached&quot; workers who are looking for work but have not actively in the last month. The &quot;disguised unemployed&quot; include &quot;discouraged&quot; workers who stopped looking because there were no jobs during the &quot;deep and long recession&quot;. Others include 4.7 million part-time workers who want full-time jobs. The government counts the &quot;unemployed&quot; as &quot;people who don’t have a job&quot; but have &quot;actively looked for one in the previous four weeks, and are available for work.&quot; In 2014, then-Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen, said that because of the depth and length of the depression which created so many &quot;long-term unemployed&quot;—representing 1/3 of jobless workers, the &quot;high number of people who are working part-time even though they want full-time jobs&quot;, and the number of people who voluntarily quit, &quot;we shouldn&#x27;t focus only on the unemployment rate.&quot; By 2014, labor force participation rate had fallen to 63% in the US, the &quot;lowest level in a generation&quot;.
In a June 7, 2008 article in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Heather Scoffield wrote that for the first time since 1982, Canada&#x27;s unemployment rate was lower than that of the United States. Scoffield said that this indicated that the economic recession was &quot;less painful in Canada&quot; where the May unemployment rate was 6.1% while the US rate was 5.5%. At the height of the 2008–2009 recession in Canada, unemployment peaked at 8.3 percent. The subprime mortgage crisis and the 2007–2009 which followed, increased the unemployment rate to a peak of 10% in October 2009. Since then, the unemployment rate has been steadily falling. It reached 5% in December 2015.
==Government spending==
Government spending refers to public expenditure on goods and services.

===General revenue (Canada)===

In FY2017 the Canadian federal government spent $311 billion. Elderly benefits, which &quot;cost $48.1 billion, or 15 cents of every tax dollar&quot;—which include the Old Age Security (OAS) and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)—represented the &quot;biggest single expense&quot;. Unlike the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), the &quot;OAS and GIS are funded through general revenues—they not independently funded&quot;. Other expenses included &quot;All other departments and agencies&quot; $51 billion, Other transfer payments 41.5 billion, Canada Health Transfer 36 billion, National Defence 25 billion, Public Debt Charges 24.15 billion, Children&#x27;s Benefits 22 billion, Employment Insurance 20.7 billion, Fiscal Arrangements 17.1 billion, Canada Social Transfer 4.3 billion, Crown Corporations 8 billion, and Gas Tax Fund 2 billion.

===Mandatory and discretionary spending (United States)===
The United States federal budget includes mandatory spending, discretionary spending, and interest on debt. In the United States in 2017, mandatory spending totaled $2.5 trillion or 13.1% of GDP and included Social security $939 billion or 4.9% of GDP, Medicare 591 billion or 3.1% GDP, Medicaid $375 billion or 2.0% of GDP, and Other 614 billion or 3.2% GDP. Discretionary spending totaled $1.2 trillion or 6.3% of GDP and included Defense 590 billion or 3.1%GDP, and Nondefense 610 billion or 3.2% GDP. Interest on debt totaled 263 billion representing 1.4% of GDP.

==Fiscal and monetary policy==
===Inflation and the consumer price index===
In Canada in September 2018, the consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.2% on a year-over-year basis. The Bank of Canada&#x27;s monthly CPI measures changes in consumer prices based on the price of a &quot;fixed basket of goods and services&quot; purchased by Canadian consumers, such as made up of goods and services that Canadians typically buy, such as food, housing, transportation, furniture, clothing, recreation, and other items, with the target of maintaining the rate of inflation (the &quot;year-over-year increase in the total CPI) at 2%—&quot;midpoint of an inflation-control target range of 1 to 3%&quot;. On October 24, 2018 the Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate to 1.75%, the highest it has reached in ten years to prevent inflation. The key interest rate had been kept low in response to the 2008 economic slowdown. By raising the rate, the Bank of Canada is indicating that the Canadian economy no longer needs &quot;stimulus.&quot;

In September 2018, The US Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate to 2.25%.

==Social mobility==
According to an OECD publication entitled &quot;A Broken Social Elevator? How to Promote Social Mobility&quot;, with the rise in income inequality since the 1990s, social mobility has shifted so that fewer people in the bottom quintiles have moved up the ladder; those in the higher quintiles remain wealthy. Based on the OECD average in this 2018 report, it takes an estimated 4 generations for a low-income family in Canada to earn the Canadian average income; the OECD average is an estimated 4.5 generations and in the United States it takes 5 generations or 150 years to earn the American average income. See Socioeconomic mobility in the United States and Socio-economic mobility in Canada.

==Workforce productivity==

Labor or workforce productivity measures the efficiency with which labor is used to produce goods and services. According to a 2017 Conference Board of Canada article, in 2015 &quot;Canada&#x27;s level of labour productivity was US$49 per hour worked, much lower than that of the United States, at US$63.&quot; Alberta&#x27;s level was 99%. The lowest was in Prince Edward Island at 58%. The article noted that over previous five-year period, Canada &quot;outperformed&quot; the US on &quot;labour productivity growth&quot;. In May 2018, Statistics Canada reported that across Canada, labor productivity rose 2.2%; the increase in 2016 was 0.6%.

According to a 2004 article, Canadian workers were estimated to be 82% as productive per hour as their American counterparts. The industries with the largest productivity advantages for the US are the manufacturing (particularly electronics and computer), finance, and service sectors. Industries where Canada is more productive than the US are the construction and natural resources sectors with Canadian workers achieving 129% relative productivity.

The productivity gap was even larger in the 1950s but the difference narrowed, aided by the elimination of the smaller market problem through free trade. The gap closed somewhat in the 1980s but at a much slower pace than in the 1960s. From 1961 to 1973 labour productivity rose annually by 3.3 percent in Canada and 1.7 percent in the United States. According to a 1997 IMF report, from 1973 to 1995 productivity growth was 1.1% in Canada and 0.8% in the United States.

The productivity gap began to widen again in the 1990s, particularly in the manufacturing sector. According to a 2005 article, by 2000, this was called Canada&#x27;s &quot;Excellence Gap&quot; by the Chief Economist of Canadian Manufacturers &amp; Exporters. The United States has the second-highest productivity of the G8 countries, while Canada&#x27;s is 5th based on the 1997 estimate.

Five main reasons for the productivity gap: the lower capital intensity of economic activity in Canada; an innovation gap in Canada relative to the United States; Canada&#x27;s relatively underdeveloped high-tech sector; and more limited economies of scale and scope in Canada.

<text>The Verbenaceae ( ), the verbena family or vervain family, is a family of mainly tropical flowering plants. It contains trees, shrubs, and herbs notable for heads, spikes, or clusters of small flowers, many of which have an aromatic smell.

The family Verbenaceae includes 32 genera and 800 species. Phylogenetic studies have shown that numerous genera traditionally classified in Verbenaceae belong instead in Lamiaceae. The mangrove genus &quot;Avicennia&quot;, sometimes placed in the Verbenaceae or in its own family, Avicenniaceae, has been placed in the Acanthaceae.

Economically important Verbenaceae include:
* Lemon verbena (&quot;Aloysia triphylla&quot;), grown for aroma or flavoring
* Verbenas or vervains (&quot;Verbena&quot;), some used in herbalism, others grown in gardens

<text>Permanent Waves is the seventh studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, released on January 14, 1980 through Anthem Records. After touring to support their previous album, &quot;Hemispheres&quot; (1978), the band began working on new material for a follow-up in July 1979. This material showed a shift in the group&#x27;s sound towards more concise arrangements and radio-friendly songs (such as &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; and &quot;Freewill&quot;), though their progressive rock blueprint is still evident on &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; and the nine-minute closer &quot;Natural Science.&quot; Bassist/vocalist Geddy Lee also employed a more restrained vocal delivery compared to previous albums. &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; was the first of seven studio albums the band recorded at Le Studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec with production handled by the group and Terry Brown.

&quot;Permanent Waves&quot; received a mostly positive reception from critics and became the band&#x27;s most successful album at the time of its release, reaching No.3 in Canada and the UK and No.4 in the United States. It was certified platinum in the latter by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling one million copies. Rush released &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; as a single in February 1980 and toured in support of the album later that year.

==Background and writing==
In June 1979, the band finished its eight-month tour of the United States, Canada and Europe in support of its sixth studio album, &quot;Hemispheres&quot; (1978). The tour had taken its toll on the group and, for the first time in the band&#x27;s history, each member agreed to take a six-week break before starting work on a new album. They regrouped in mid-July 1979 at Lakewoods Farm near Flesherton, Ontario to write and rehearse new material for two weeks. They set up their equipment in the basement and put down what Peart described as &quot;a giant hodge-podge of instrumental mish-mash,&quot; initially titled &quot;Uncle Tounouse&quot;, during the first session. The piece was not developed further but sections of it were used as the basis of passages on other songs they would record. A typical day&#x27;s schedule involved Lifeson cooking breakfast for the trio after which Lifeson and Lee worked on musical ideas while Peart gathered his notes and walked to a nearby cottage to write lyrics with &quot;Entre Nous&quot; being the only set completed prior to their arrival at Lakewoods Farm. This routine had a productive effect on the three with &quot;The Spirit of Radio,&quot; &quot;Freewill&quot; and &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; being recorded within several days without considerable effort. The new songs marked a shift in the group&#x27;s musical style towards more concise arrangements and radio-friendly songs, although Peart denied that the band consciously set out to produce commercial music. Peart attempted to write a song based on &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, the 14th-century epic set in King Arthur&#x27;s time, but it was abandoned after it was deemed too out of place with the other material.

With some material prepared for &quot;Permanent Waves&quot;, Rush moved into Sound Kitchen Studio in northern Toronto, Ontario with their producer Terry Brown to put their ideas onto tape. &quot;The Spirit of Radio,&quot; &quot;Freewill&quot; and &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; were further polished on the warm-up tour during soundchecks and by early September, &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; and &quot;Freewill&quot; were being performed live on the band&#x27;s warm-up tour in August and September 1979.

In September 1979, Rush headed to Le Studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec to record &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; with Brown and engineer Paul Northfield. Having recorded their previous two studio albums in Wales the band felt it was time for a change and initially chose Trident Studios in London, but cancelled due to the high costs of studio time and accommodation. The idea of working in a busy city environment became something they now wished to avoid and instead sought a remote location.

The recording sessions involved the band tweaking the settings of instruments and positioning of microphones. They recorded basic tracks with multiple takes until they captured the best performance. While Lee, Lifeson, and Brown began overdubs, Peart began attempting to write another longer song, and after enduring three days of writer&#x27;s block, &quot;Natural Science&quot; was born. Fin Costello was then brought in to photograph the band in the studio. Cover art director Hugh Syme was also brought in and recorded a piano solo on &quot;Different Strings&quot;. Music was composed for &quot;Natural Science&quot;, with some parts reused from the discarded &quot;Green Knight&quot;. The water sounds at the beginning of the song were created by splashing oars in the private lake, performed by Brown and studio assistant Kim Bickerdike, and the natural echo outside was used to record various instruments. The rough mixes on the album were complete, and the final mix was completed in two weeks at Trident Studios.

Upon the album&#x27;s completion, Lifeson felt unsure about the record and for a period of time, could not listen to it due to his feeling that it failed to present any fresh ideas. His opinion changed when he first heard the album on the radio after its release, realising he had overreacted.

==Songs==
&quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; featured the band&#x27;s early experiments with a reggae style in its closing section, which was explored further in the band&#x27;s next three albums, &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, &quot;Signals&quot;, and &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;. The group had experimented with reggae-influenced riffs in the studio and had come up with a reggae introduction to &quot;Working Man&quot; on their tours, so they decided to incorporate a passage into &quot;The Spirit of Radio,&quot; as Lifeson said, &quot;to make us smile and have a little fun.&quot; Peart wrote the lyrics with Toronto radio station CFNY-FM in mind which had adopted the title as its slogan.

&quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; uses multiple time signatures, and possesses a dark, ominous feel in its first half. Its lyrics are based on a simple concept: a vision of sunlight breaking through storm clouds. The title is a reference to the natural phenomenon of the sun breaking through the clouds in visible rays, which in turn is named after the Biblical ladder to heaven on which Jacob saw angels ascending and descending in a vision. Early in Rush&#x27;s 2015 R40 Live Tour, Geddy Lee incorrectly stated that the song had never been played live before, but was corrected by fans on the internet (the song had been performed during the Permanent Waves tour and a live recording of the song was featured on &quot;Exit... Stage Left&quot;).

&quot;Entre Nous&quot;, French for &quot;Between Us&quot;, did not receive heavy radio airplay and was not performed live until the Snakes &amp; Arrows Tour in 2007.

While the band began stepping back from the epic song format on this album, the closing track &quot;Natural Science&quot; is more than nine minutes long and is composed of three distinct movements: I) Tide Pools, II) Hyperspace, and III) Permanent Waves. The lyrics are driven by concepts of natural science. It was featured, with a different arrangement, on the 1996 Test for Echo Tour, the 2002 Vapor Trails Tour, the 2007–2008 Snakes &amp; Arrows Tour and the 2015 R40 Live Tour.

==Artwork==
The background scene comes from a photo, taken by Flip Schulke, of the Galveston Seawall in Texas during Hurricane Carla on September 11, 1961. The woman in the foreground is Canadian model Paula Turnbull, who is also featured on &quot;Exit... Stage Left&quot; (1981) and the man waving in the background is sleeve designer Hugh Syme. To create the appearance of Turnbull&#x27;s skirt blowing in the wind, a fan was placed out of frame when she was photographed.

==Release==
&quot;Permanent Waves&quot; was released in the US on January 14, 1980. In addition to receiving favorable reviews from sources such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, it reached No. 3 in Canada and the UK and No. 4 in the US. In two months, the album had sold one million copies in the US.

The album was certified gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association, and in September 1980 Rush sent the gold record to Terry Fox, shortly after he had to abandon the Marathon of Hope.

==Tour==
Following the album&#x27;s release, Rush supported &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; with a concert tour of Canada, America and the UK between January 17 and June 22, 1980. The band toured with a 25-member road crew who handled the 60 tons of equipment to stage the show, which included Boeing 707 landing lights, a $50,000 mixing console and a screen projector behind the band. The tour cost $12,500 per day and each band member earned $1,000 per show.

<text>Bahrain International Airport (, romanized: &quot;Maṭār al-Baḥrayn al-dwalī&quot;) is the international airport of Bahrain. Located on Muharraq Island, adjacent to the capital Manama and the city of Muharraq, it serves as the hub for the national carrier Gulf Air. The airport is managed by the Bahrain Airport Company. Established in 1927, it is the Arabian Gulf&#x27;s oldest international airport.

==History==
===Origins===
The origins of Bahrain&#x27;s international airport dates to 1927 when a chartered flight to Bahrain landed. The first scheduled commercial airliner to arrive in Bahrain, in 1932, was a flight from London to Delhi operated on a Handley Page H.P.42 aircraft named &quot;Hannibal&quot;. The H.P.42 carried only 24 passengers, and the flight from London had taken several days of flying at speeds of 100 miles per hour. Through this regularly scheduled service, Bahrain became established as one of the Persian Gulf&#x27;s first international airports.

During World War II, the airport was used by the United States Army Air Forces Air Transport Command Central African Wing, being designated as Station # 13. It functioned as a stopover en route to Abadan Airport, Iran or Sharjah Airport, in present-day UAE on the Karachi-Cairo route. From 1943 until Bahrain&#x27;s independence in December 1971, the Royal Air Force maintained a military installation at the airfield known initially as &quot;RAF Bahrain&quot; and from 1963 as &quot;RAF Muharraq&quot;. The majority of these facilities were later acquired by the Bahraini flag carrier airline, Gulf Air, while a small portion continues to be utilized by the U.S. Navy as Aviation Support Unit (ASU) Bahrain.

===20th century ===
In 1936, the operation of H.P.42 aircraft from London to India via Bahrain had been stepped up to a twice-weekly frequency. In 1937, Bahrain saw the regular service of the Empire sea planes. The landing strip of these giants on the water was from where the marina club is located in Mina Salman today. From the 1950s, BOAC operated several services a week through Bahrain. These included weekly services to Karachi, Singapore, Hong Kong and three times a week to Sydney. 1950 was a significant year not only for Muharraq as an international airport, but also for Bahrain&#x27;s commercial aviation history. In this year, a new local airline, Gulf Aviation Company, was formed – the forerunner of Gulf Air. The company started with only one aircraft, a second-hand Anson Mark II, which was used initially on services to Dhahran. However, within two years, the fleet had expanded to four de Havilland aircraft and DC-3s for use on a steadily growing network in the Persian Gulf. This established Bahrain on an international stage. It was easily the most modern and advanced airport in the Persian Gulf with a good runway, control tower, lighting, communication facilities and even restaurants. It began to attract other carriers such as Middle East Airlines, Air India, Air Ceylon and Iran Air – mostly operating Dakotas. In December 1961, a new passenger terminal opened at the airport. During 1970–1971, RAF Muharraq was scaled back and eventually closed. In December 1971, the airport opened new passenger facilities, which included a wide area that could accommodate four 747 aircraft. In 1976, the airport marked another significant first with the inauguration of supersonic flights, which saw the start-up of regular BA Concorde service between London and Bahrain. Pan Am introduced direct flights to New York in December 1976. It operated the route with Boeing 747SPs.

In the 1980s and 1990s, major facelifts took place and several major airline companies made the airport a destination. In 1994, a US$100 million terminal was inaugurated which boosted the airport&#x27;s maximum capacity to 10 million passengers a year. In July 1994, Gulf Air started nonstop service to New York on Airbus A340s. Due to the length of the route, westbound flights occasionally had to make a refuelling stop.

===21st century expansion===
In 2008, the airport was placed under the management of the newly created Bahrain Airport Company, which falls under the umbrella of the Gulf Air Holding Company, which in turn is owned by Mumtalakat, Bahrain&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund. On 8 October 2009, it was announced that BHD 1.8 billion expansion of Bahrain International Airport will start in 2010. The expansion, planned over the next 30 years, intended to triple the passenger capacity to 27 million a year.

In April 2010, United Airlines began service to Washington, D.C., via Kuwait. The carrier flew the route with a Boeing 777. United left Bahrain in January 2016.

Since 2020 the airport has placed an increased effort to enhance the sustainability of the airport, including a LEED gold certification for the new Terminal Passenger Building in 2021, achieving a second consecutive ISO recertification for quality, environmental and occupational health and safety management systems in March 2024 and becoming the first airport in the world to achieve the International Air Transport Association Environmental Assessment Certification in November 2024.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===
The airport&#x27;s new $1.1 billion terminal opened on 28 January 2021. At 210,000 square meters, the Passenger Terminal increases Bahrain International Airport&#x27;s (BIA) capacity to 14 million passengers and 130,000 air traffic movements per year with a handling capacity of 4,700 bags per peak hour. The new terminal cost 1.1 billion USD. The terminal features check-in halls, check-in desks, passport control booths, E-gates, security lanes, a 9,000 sqm duty-free retail space, lounges, food and beverage zones, 24 departure gates, and 7,000 new parking spaces both at-grade and in multi-story facilities.

===Cargo===
Through the airport&#x27;s 25,000 sqm Cargo Terminal, a wide range of services are offered, including export cargo sales, transhipment, inter-airport trucking, and customs clearance. Bahrain is also the regional hub for DHL Aviation. With 115 weekly flights and 250 vehicles, DHL operates an integrated air and land network. Other cargo and logistics companies operating out of the airport include FedEx, TNT Express, Aramex, and Global Logistical Services (GLS).

===Ground handling===
Bahrain Airport Services (BAS) provides airport services at Bahrain International Airport (BIA). Supported by a 3,000-strong staff, BAS is an ISAGO-accredited Ground Service Provider. Overseeing the Kingdom&#x27;s oil, gas, and petroleum assets, Bahrain Jet Fuel Company (BJFCO) is a joint venture between Bahrain Airport Company and the nogaholding. BJFCO is currently constructing a fuel farm complex in the northeastern area of the airport as part of a major restructuring of the Kingdom&#x27;s aviation fueling industry.

=== Awal Private Terminal ===
The Awal Private Terminal at Bahrain International Airport is a dedicated facility designed to provide exclusive services for VIP passengers, government officials, and private aviation clients. The terminal offers private check-in, security screening, and immigration procedures. The 4,000 m² terminal is operated by Hala Bahrain, a subsidiary owned by Bahrain Airport Company.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 12 June 1950, An Air France Douglas DC-4 crashed 5.5 km (3.4mls) into the sea SE of Bahrain because the pilot did not keep an accurate check of his altitude and rate of descent during the approach, allowing the aircraft to impact the sea. Pilot fatigue also may have played a factor. 46 out of the 52 passengers and crew were killed.
* On 14 June 1950, just two days later, an Air France Douglas DC-4 flying the same leg crashed again into the sea at night SE of Bahrain because of similar errors on approach two days prior. Also BAH lacked radio landing aids and suitable runway approach lights. 40 of the 53 passengers and crew died.
* On 9 September 1970, British Overseas Airways Corporation Flight 7755, a Vickers VC10, flying from Bombay (now Mumbai) to London via Bahrain and Beirut was hijacked after departing Bahrain and forcibly landed at Dawson&#x27;s Field in Jordan. The hijacking was done by a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine sympathizer who wanted to influence the British government to free Leila Khaled.
* In August 2000, a Gulf Air Airbus 320 (Gulf Air Flight 072) from Cairo crashed when landing at the airport. All 135 passengers and eight crew died.
* In August 2017, an American F-18 fighter jet crash landed at the airport, with the pilot safely ejecting.

<text>Animal communication is the transfer of information from one or a group of animals (sender or senders) to one or more other animals (receiver or receivers) that affects the current or future behavior of the receivers. Information may be sent intentionally, as in a courtship display, or unintentionally, as in the transfer of scent from the predator to prey with kairomones. Information may be transferred to an &quot;audience&quot; of several receivers. Animal communication is a rapidly growing area of study in disciplines including animal behavior, sociology, neurology, and animal cognition. Many aspects of animal behavior, such as symbolic name use, emotional expression, learning, and sexual behavior, are being understood in new ways.

When the information from the sender changes the behavior of a receiver, the information is referred to as a &quot;signal&quot;. Signalling theory predicts that for a signal to be maintained in the population, both the sender and receiver should usually receive some benefit from the interaction. Signal production by senders and the perception and subsequent response of receivers are thought to coevolve. Signals often involve multiple mechanisms, e.g., both visual and auditory, and for a signal to be understood, the coordinated behavior of both sender and receiver requires careful study.

== Animal languages ==
The sounds animals make are important because they communicate the animals&#x27; state. Some animals species have been taught simple versions of human languages. Animals can use, for example, electrolocation and echolocation to communicate about prey and location.

==Modes==

===Visual===
;Gestures: Most animals understand communication through a visual display of distinctive body parts or bodily movements. Animals will reveal or accentuate a body part to relay certain information. The parent herring gull displays its bright yellow bill on the ground next over its chick when it has returned to the nest with food. The chicks exhibit a begging response by tapping the red spot on the lower mandible of the parent herring gull&#x27;s bill. This signal stimulates the parent to regurgitate food and completes the feeding signal. The distinctive morphological feature accentuated in this communication is the parent&#x27;s red-spotted bill, while the tapping towards the ground makes the red spot visible to the chick, demonstrating a distinctive movement. Frans de Waal studied bonobos and chimps to understand if language was somehow evolved by gestures. He found that both apes and humans only use intentional gestures to communicate.
;Facial expression: Another important signal of emotion in animal communication are facial gestures. Blue and Yellow Macaws were studied to understand how they reacted to interactions with a familiar animal caretaker. Studies show that Blue and Yellow Macaws demonstrated a significant amount of blushing frequently during mutual interactions with a caretaker. In another experiment, Jeffrey Mogil studied facial expression in mice in response to increments of increasing pain. He found that mice exhibited five recognizable facial expressions: orbital tightening, nose and cheek bulge, and changes in ear and whisker carriage.
;Gaze-following: Social animals use gaze-following as a form of communication through monitoring head and eye orientation in other mammals. Studies have been conducted on apes, monkeys, dogs, birds, wolves, and tortoises, and have focused on two different tasks: &quot;follow[ing] another&#x27;s gaze into distant space&quot; and &quot;follow[ing] another&#x27;s gaze geometrically around a visual barrier, e.g., by repositioning themselves to follow a gaze cue when faced with a barrier blocking their view&quot;. A broad range of animals have been proven to exhibit the latter, however, only apes, dogs, wolves, and corvids (ravens) have been able to follow another&#x27;s gaze into distant space. Marmosets and ibis were unable to demonstrate &quot;geometric gaze following&quot;. Researchers do not yet have a clear picture of the cognitive basis of gaze following, but developmental evidence indicates that &quot;simple&quot; gaze following and &quot;geometric&quot; gaze following probably rely on different cognitive mechanisms.
;Colour change: Colour change can be separated into changes that occur during growth and development, and those triggered by mood, social context, or abiotic factors such as temperature. The latter are seen in many taxa. Some cephalopods, such as the octopus and the cuttlefish, have specialized skin cells (chromatophores) that can change the apparent colour, opacity, and reflectiveness of their skin. In addition to their use for camouflage, rapid changes in skin colour are used while hunting and in courtship rituals. Cuttlefish may display two entirely different signals simultaneously from opposite sides of their body. When a male cuttlefish courts a female in the presence of other males, he displays a male pattern facing the female and a female pattern facing away, to deceive other males. Some colour signals occur in cycles. For example, when a female olive baboon begins to ovulate, her anogenital area swells and turns a bright red/pink. This signals to males that she is ready to mate. Humboldt squid are bioluminescent and thus capable of communicating visually in dark ocean environments.
;Bioluminescent communication: Communication by the production of light occurs commonly in vertebrates and invertebrates in the oceans, particularly at depths (e.g., angler fish). Two well-known forms of land bioluminescence occur in fireflies and glow worms. Other insects, insect larvae, annelids, arachnids, and even species of fungi possess bioluminescent abilities. Some bioluminescent animals produce the light themselves, whereas others have a symbiotic relationship with bioluminescent bacteria. Animals exhibit bioluminescent light to lure in prey, attract a mate, or protect themselves from potential predators. (See also: List of bioluminescent organisms)

=== Signaling ===
There are many different types of signals that animals use to differentiate their position of direction, location, and distance. Practitioners study the issues of animal position by geometric viewings. Environmental and social influences are indicators of geometric viewings. Animals rely on signals called electrolocating and echolocating; they use sensory senses in order to navigate and find prey. Signals are used as a form of commutation through the environment. Active signals or other types of signals influence receivers behavior and signals move quicker in distance to reach receivers.

===Auditory===

Many animals communicate through vocalization. Vocal communication serves many purposes, including mating rituals, warning calls, conveying location of food sources, and social learning. In a number of species, males perform calls during mating rituals as a form of competition against other males and to signal to females. Examples include frogs, hammer-headed bats, red deer, humpback whales, elephant seals, and songbirds. Other instances of vocal communication include the alarm calls of the Campbell monkey, the territorial calls of gibbons, and the use of frequency in greater spear-nosed bats to distinguish between groups. The vervet monkey gives a distinct alarm call for each of its four different predators, and the reactions of other monkeys vary appropriately according to the call. For example, if an alarm call signals a python, the monkeys climb into the trees, whereas the &quot;eagle&quot; alarm causes monkeys to seek a hiding place on the ground. Prairie dogs also use complex calls that signal predator differences. According to Con Slobodchikoff and others, prairie dog calls communicate the type, size, and speed of an approaching predator.  Whale vocalizations have been found to have different dialects based on social learning. Mammalian acoustic culture was first discovered in southern resident orcas in 1978.

Not all animals use vocalization as a means of auditory communication. Many arthropods rub specialized body parts together to produce sound. This is known as stridulation. Crickets and grasshoppers are well known for this, but many others use stridulation as well, including crustaceans, spiders, scorpions, wasps, ants, beetles, butterflies, moths, millipedes, and centipedes. Another means of auditory communication is the vibration of swim bladders in bony fish. The structure of swim bladders and the attached sonic muscles varies greatly across bony fish families, resulting in a wide variety of sounds. Striking body parts together can also produce auditory signals. A well-known example of this is the tail tip vibration of rattlesnakes as a warning signal. Other examples include bill clacking in birds, wing clapping in manakin courtship displays, and chest beating in gorillas.
Burrowing animal species are known to whistle to communicate threats, and sometimes mood. Species such as the marmot species, including the groundhog (woodchuck), and the alpine marmot show this trait. Whistling is used by animals such as prairie dogs to communicate threats, with prairie dogs having one of the most complex communication systems in the animal kingdom. Prairie dogs are able to communicate an animal&#x27;s speed, shape, size, species, and for humans specific attire and if the human is carrying a gun. This method of communication is usually done by having a stand on two feet and surveying for potential threats while the rest of the pack finds food. Once a threat has been identified the sentry sounds a whistle alarm, (sometimes describing the threat) at which point the pack retreats to their burrows. The intensity of the threat is usually determined by how long the sentry whistles. The sentry continues to whistle the alarm until the entirety of the pack has gone to safety, at which point the sentry returns to the burrow.

===Olfactory===

Despite being the oldest method of communication, chemical communication is one of the least understood forms due in part to the sheer abundance of chemicals in our environment and the difficulty of detecting and measuring all the chemicals in a sample. The ability to detect chemicals in the environment serves many functions, a crucial one being the detection of food, a function that first arose in single-celled organisms (bacteria) living in the oceans during the early days of life on Earth. As this function evolved, organisms began to differentiate between chemical compounds emanating from resources, conspecifics (same species; i.e., mates and kin), and heterospecifics (different species; i.e., competitors and predators).

For instance, a small minnow species may do well to avoid habitat with a detectable concentration of chemical cues associated with a predator species such as a northern pike. Minnows with the ability to perceive the presence of predators before they are close enough to be seen and then respond with adaptive behavior (such as hiding) are more likely to survive and reproduce. Atlantic salmon go a step further than detecting a predator&#x27;s cue: when an individual is damaged by a predator, it releases a chemical cue to its conspecifics. As has also been observed in other species, acidification and changes in pH physically disrupt these chemical cues, which has various implications for animal behavior.

Scent marking and scent rubbing are common forms of olfactory communication in mammals. An example of scent rubbing by an animal can be seen from bears, bears do this as a way to mark territory or let others know they are there and to stay away. Wolves scent-mark frequently during the breeding season.

===Electric===
Electrocommunication is a rare form of communication in animals. It is seen primarily in aquatic animals, though some land mammals, notably the platypus and echidnas, sense electric fields that might be used for communication.

Weakly electric fishes provide an example of electrocommunication, together with electrolocation. These fish use an electric organ to generate an electric field, which is detected by electroreceptors. Differences in the waveform and frequency of changes in the field convey information on species, sex, and identity. These electric signals can be generated in response to hormones, circadian rhythms, and interactions with other fish. They can also serve to mediate social hierarchy amongst species that have a social order. Some predators, such as sharks and rays, are able to eavesdrop on these electrogenic fish through passive electroreception.

===Touch===
: &quot;For more on the mechanism for touch, see Somatosensory system and Mechanoreceptors&quot;

Touch is a key factor in many social interactions. Examples include:
;Fighting: In a fight, touch may be used to challenge an opponent and to coordinate movements during the fight. It may also be used by the loser to indicate submission.
;Mating: Mammals often initiate mating by grooming, stroking or rubbing against each other. This provides the opportunity to apply chemical signals and to assess those excreted by the potential mate. Touch may also announce the intention of the male to mount the female, as when a male kangaroo grabs the tail of a female. During mating, touch stimuli are important for pair positioning, coordination and genital stimulation.
;Social integration: Touch is widely used for social integration, a use that is typified by the social grooming of one animal by another. Social grooming has several functions; it removes parasites and debris from the groomed animal, it reaffirms the social bond or hierarchical relationship between the animals, and it gives the groomer an opportunity to examine olfactory cues on the groomed individual, perhaps adding additional ones. This behaviour has been observed in social insects, birds and mammals.
;Foraging: Some ant species recruit fellow workers to new food finds by first tapping them with their antennae and forelegs, then leading them to the food source while keeping physical contact. &quot;Patrollers&quot; leave the nest to check for danger nearby and return to recruit &quot;foragers&quot; by making physical contact. Another example of this is the waggle dance of honey bees.
;Huddling: Prolonged physical contact or huddling also serves social integration. Huddling promotes heat exchange, together with the transfer of olfactory or tactile information. Some organisms live in constant contact in a colony, for example colonial corals. When individuals are linked tightly in this way an entire colony can react on the aversive or alarm movements made by only a few individuals. In several herbivorous insect nymphs and larvae, aggregations where there is prolonged contact play a major role in group coordination. These aggregations may take the form of a procession or a rosette.

===Seismic===
Seismic communication is the exchange of information using self-generated vibrational signals transmitted via a substrate such as the soil, water, spider webs, plant stems, or a blade of grass. This form of communication has several advantages, for example it can be sent regardless of light and noise levels, and it usually has a short range and short persistence, which may reduce the danger of detection by predators. The use of seismic communication is found in many taxa, including frogs, kangaroo rats, mole rats, bees, nematode worms, and others. Tetrapods usually make seismic waves by drumming on the ground with a body part, a signal that is sensed by the sacculus of the receiver. The sacculus is an organ in the inner ear containing a membranous sac that is used for balance, but can also detect seismic waves in animals that use this form of communication. Vibrations may be combined with other sorts of communication.

===Thermal===

 A number of different snakes have the ability to sense infrared (IR) thermal radiation, which allows these reptiles to derive thermal images from the radiant heat emitted by predators or prey at wavelengths between 5 and 30 μm. The accuracy of this sense is such that a blind rattlesnake can target its strike to the vulnerable body parts of a prey animal. It was previously thought that the pit organs evolved primarily as prey detectors, but it is now believed that they may also be used to control body temperature.

The facial pits enabling thermoregulation underwent parallel evolution in pitvipers and some boas and pythons, having evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons. The electrophysiology of the structure is similar between lineages, but it differs in gross structure anatomy. Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ on either side of the head, between the eye and the nostril (loreal pit), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales. Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a simple pit structure. Within the family Viperidae, the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily Crotalinae: the pitvipers. Despite the detection of IR radiation, the pits&#x27; IR mechanism is dissimilar to photoreceptors; while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the facial pits of snakes is a temperature sensitive ion channel. It senses infrared signals through a mechanism involving warming of the pit organ, rather than chemical reaction to light. This is consistent with the thin pit membrane, which allows incoming IR radiation to quickly and precisely warm a given ion channel and trigger a nerve impulse, as well as vascularize the pit membrane to rapidly cool the ion channel back to its original &quot;resting&quot; or &quot;inactive&quot; temperature.

Common vampire bats (&quot;Desmodus rotundus&quot;) have specialized IR sensors in their nose-leaf. Vampire bats are the only mammals that feed exclusively on blood. The IR sense enables Desmodus to localize homeothermic animals such as cattle and horses within a range of about 10 to 15 cm. This infrared perception may be used in detecting regions of maximal blood flow on targeted prey.

==Autocommunication==
Autocommunication is a type of communication in which the sender and receiver are the same individual. The sender emits a signal that is altered by the environment and eventually is received by the same individual. The altered signal provides information that can indicate food, predators or conspecifics. Because the sender and receiver are the same animal, selection pressure maximizes signal efficacy, i.e. the degree to which an emitted signal is correctly identified by a receiver despite propagation distortion and noise. There are some species, such as the pacific herring, which have evolved to intercept these messages from their predators. They are able to use it as an early warning sign and respond defensively. There are two types of autocommunication. The first is active electrolocation, where the organism emits an electrical pulse through its electric organ and senses the projected geometrical property of the object. This is found in the electric fish Gymnotiformes (knifefishes) and Mormyridae(elephantfish). The second type of autocommunication is echolocation, found in bats and toothed whales. Echolocation involves emitting sounds and interpreting the vibrations that return from objects. In bats, echolocation also serves the purpose of mapping their environment. They are capable of recognizing a space they have been in before without any visible light because they can memorize patterns in the feedback they get from echolocation.

==Functions==
There are many functions of animal communication. However, some have been studied in more detail than others. This includes:

;Communication during contests: Animal communication plays a vital role in determining the winner of contest over a resource. Many species have distinct signals that signal aggression or willingness to attack or signals to convey retreat during competitions over food, territories, or mates.

;Mating rituals: Animals produce signals to attract the attention of a possible mate or to solidify pair bonds. These signals frequently involve the display of body parts or postures. For example, a gazelle will assume characteristic poses to initiate mating. Mating signals can also include the use of olfactory signals or mating calls unique to a species. Animals that form lasting pair bonds often have symmetrical displays that they make to each other. Famous examples are the mutual presentation of reeds by great crested grebes studied by Julian Huxley, the triumph displays shown by many species of geese and penguins on their nest sites, and the spectacular courtship displays by birds of paradise. &quot;Copulation calls&quot; in mammals can indicate a female&#x27;s breeding status or attract other mates.
;Ownership/territorial: Signals used to claim or defend a territory, food, or a mate. Polygynous lizards (&quot;Anolis carolinensis&quot;) will show greater signs of aggression from farther distances between males than between females when defending a territory or mate. It is believed that males have evolved to remain distant from each other due to higher reproductive consequences as opposed to females.
;Redirected aggression: Some animals who are fearful of stimuli will attack anyone near them. 
;Food-related signals: Many animals make &quot;food calls&quot; to attract a mate, offspring, or other members of a social group to a food source. Perhaps the most elaborate food-related signal is the Waggle dance of honeybees studied by Karl von Frisch. One well-known example of begging of offspring in a clutch or litter is altricial songbirds. Young ravens will signal to older ravens when they encounter new or untested food.  Rhesus macaques will send food calls to inform other monkeys of a food source to avoid punishment.  Pheromones are released by many social insects to lead the other members of the society to the food source. For example, ants leave a pheromone trail on the ground that can be followed by other ants to lead them to the food source.
;Alarm calls: Alarm calls communicate the threat of a predator. This allows all members of a social group (and sometimes other species) to respond accordingly. This may include running for cover, becoming immobile, or gathering into a group to reduce the risk of attack. Alarm signals are not always vocalizations. Crushed ants will release an alarm pheromone to attract more ants and send them into an attack state.
;Meta-communication: Signals that will modify the meaning of subsequent signals. One example is the &#x27;play face&#x27; in dogs which signals that a subsequent aggressive signal is part of a play fight rather than a serious aggressive episode.

==Interpretation of animal behaviour==
As described above, many animal gestures, postures, and sounds, convey meaning to nearby animals. These signals are often easier to describe than to interpret. It is tempting, especially with domesticated animals and apes, to anthropomorphize, that is, to interpret animal actions in human terms, but this can be quite misleading; for example, an ape&#x27;s &quot;smile&quot; is often a sign of aggression. Also, the same gesture may have different meanings depending on context within which it occurs. For example, a domestic dog&#x27;s tail wag and posture may be used in different ways to convey many meanings as illustrated in Charles Darwin&#x27;s The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals published in 1872. Some of Darwin&#x27;s illustrations are reproduced here.

==Interspecific communication==
Much animal communication is intraspecific, that is, it occurs between members of the same species. As for interspecific communication, that between predator and prey is of particular interest.

===Prey to predator===
If a prey animal moves, makes a noise or vibrations, or emits a smell in such a way that a predator can detect it, it is communicating with its predator. This is consistent with the definition of &quot;communication&quot; given above. This type of communication is known as interceptive eavesdropping if a predator intercepts a message intended for conspecifics.

There are however, some actions of prey species are clearly directed to actual or potential predators. A good example is warning coloration: species such as wasps that are capable of harming potential predators are often brightly coloured, and this modifies the behavior of the predator, who either instinctively or as the result of experience will avoid attacking such an animal. Some forms of mimicry fall in the same category: for example hoverflies are coloured in the same way as wasps, and although they are unable to sting, the strong avoidance of wasps by predators gives the hoverfly some protection. There are also behavioural changes that act in a similar way to warning colouration. For example, canines such as wolves and coyotes may adopt an aggressive posture, such as growling with their teeth bared, to indicate they will fight if necessary, and rattlesnakes use their well-known rattle to warn potential predators of their venomous bite. Sometimes, a behavioural change and warning colouration will be combined, as in certain species of amphibians which have most of their body coloured to blend with their surroundings, except for a brightly coloured belly. When confronted with a potential threat, they show their belly, indicating that they are poisonous in some way.

Another example of prey to predator communication is the pursuit-deterrent signal. Pursuit-deterrent signals occur when prey indicates to a predator that pursuit would be unprofitable because the signaler is prepared to escape. Pursuit-deterrent signals provide a benefit to both the signaler and receiver; they prevent the sender from wasting time and energy fleeing, and they prevent the receiver from investing in a costly pursuit that is unlikely to result in capture. Such signals can advertise prey&#x27;s ability to escape, and reflect phenotypic condition (quality advertisement), or can advertise that the prey has detected the predator (perception advertisement). Pursuit-deterrent signals have been reported for a wide variety of taxa, including fish (Godin and Davis, 1995), lizards (Cooper etc. al., 2004), ungulates (Caro, 1995), rabbits (Holley 1993), primates (Zuberbuhler et al. 1997), rodents (Shelley and Blumstein 2005, Clark, 2005), and birds (Alvarez, 1993, Murphy, 2006, 2007). A familiar example of quality advertisement pursuit-deterrent signal is &quot;stotting&quot; (sometimes called &quot;pronking&quot;), a pronounced combination of stiff-legged running while simultaneously jumping shown by some antelopes such as Thomson&#x27;s gazelle in the presence of a predator. At least 11 hypotheses for stotting have been proposed. A leading theory today is that it alerts predators that the element of surprise has been lost. Predators like cheetahs rely on surprise attacks, proven by the fact that chases are rarely successful when antelope stot. Predators do not waste energy on a chase that will likely be unsuccessful (optimal foraging behavior). Quality advertisement can be communicated by modes other than visual. The banner-tailed kangaroo rat produces several complex foot-drumming patterns in a number of different contexts, one of which is when it encounters a snake. The foot-drumming may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys vibrations through the ground that the rat is too alert for a successful attack, thus preventing the snake&#x27;s predatory pursuit.

===Predator to prey===

Typically, predators attempt to reduce communication to prey as this will generally reduce the effectiveness of their hunting. However, some forms of predator to prey communication occur in ways that change the behavior of the prey and make their capture easier, i.e. deception by the predator. A well-known example is the angler fish, an ambush predator which waits for its prey to come to it. It has a fleshy bioluminescent growth protruding from its forehead which it dangles in front of its jaws. Smaller fish attempt to take the lure, placing themselves in a better position for the angler fish to catch them. Another example of deceptive communication is observed in the genus of jumping spiders (Myrmarachne). These spiders are commonly referred to as &quot;antmimicking spiders&quot; because of the way they wave their front legs in the air to simulate antennae.

===Human/animal===

Various ways in which humans interpret the behavior of animals, or give commands to them, are consistent with the definition of interspecies communication. Skillful interpretation of animal communications may be critical to the welfare of animals that are being cared for or trained by humans.

Non-human animal species may interpret the signals of humans differently than humans themselves. For instance, a pointing command refers to a location rather than an object in dogs.

==Other aspects==

===Evolution===
The importance of communication is evident from the highly elaborate morphology, behaviour and physiology that some animals have evolved to facilitate this. These include some of the most striking structures in the animal kingdom, such as the peacock&#x27;s tail, the antlers of a stag and the frill of the frill-necked lizard, but also include even the modest red spot on a European herring gull&#x27;s bill. Highly elaborate behaviours have evolved for communication such as the dancing of cranes, the pattern changes of cuttlefish, and the gathering and arranging of materials by bowerbirds. Other evidence for the importance of communication in animals is the prioritisation of physiological features to this function. For example, birdsong appears to have brain structures entirely devoted to its production. All these adaptations require evolutionary explanation.

There are two aspects to the required explanation:

* identifying a route by which an animal that lacked the relevant feature or behaviour could acquire it;
* identifying the selective pressure that makes it adaptive for animals to develop structures that facilitate communication, emit communications, and respond to them.

Significant contributions to the first of these problems were made by Konrad Lorenz and other early ethologists. By comparing related species within groups, they showed that movements and body parts that in the primitive forms had no communicative function could be &quot;captured&quot; in a context where communication would be functional for one or both partners, and could evolve into a more elaborate, specialised form. For example, Desmond Morris showed in a study of grass finches that a beak-wiping response occurred in a range of species, serving a preening function, but that in some species this had been elaborated into a courtship signal.

The second problem has been more controversial. The early ethologists assumed that communication occurred for the good of the species as a whole, but this would require a process of group selection which is believed to be mathematically impossible in the evolution of sexually reproducing animals. Altruism towards an unrelated group is not widely accepted in the scientific community, but rather can be seen as reciprocal altruism, expecting the same behaviour from others, a benefit of living in a group. Sociobiologists argued that behaviours that benefited a whole group of animals might emerge as a result of selection pressures acting solely on the individual. A gene-centered view of evolution proposes that behaviours that enabled a gene to become wider established within a population would become positively selected for, even if their effect on individuals or the species as a whole was detrimental;

In the case of communication, an important discussion by John Krebs and Richard Dawkins established hypotheses for the evolution of such apparently altruistic or mutualistic communications as alarm calls and courtship signals to emerge under individual selection. This led to the realization that communication might not always be &quot;honest&quot; (indeed, there are some obvious examples where it is not, as in mimicry). The possibility of evolutionarily stable dishonest communication has been the subject of much controversy, with Amotz Zahavi in particular arguing that it cannot exist in the long term. Sociobiologists have also been concerned with the evolution of apparently excessive signaling structures such as the peacock&#x27;s tail; it is widely thought that these can only emerge as a result of sexual selection, which can create a positive feedback process that leads to the rapid exaggeration of a characteristic that confers an advantage in a competitive mate-selection situation.

One theory to explain the evolution of traits like a peacock&#x27;s tail is &#x27;runaway selection&#x27;. This requires two traits—a trait that exists, like the bright tail, and a preexisting bias in the female to select for that trait. Females prefer the more elaborate tails, and thus those males are able to mate successfully. Exploiting the psychology of the female, a positive feedback loop is enacted and the tail becomes bigger and brighter. Eventually, the evolution will level off because the survival costs to the male do not allow for the trait to be elaborated any further. Two theories exist to explain runaway selection. The first is the good genes hypothesis. This theory states that an elaborate display is an honest signal of fitness and truly is a better mate. The second is the handicap hypothesis. This explains that the peacock&#x27;s tail is a handicap, requiring energy to keep and makes it more visible to predators. Thus, the signal is costly to maintain, and remains an honest indicator of the signaler&#x27;s condition. Another assumption is that the signal is more costly for low quality males to produce than for higher quality males to produce. This is simply because the higher quality males have more energy reserves available to allocate to costly signaling.

===Cognitive aspects===
Ethologists and sociobiologists have characteristically analysed animal communication in terms of more or less automatic responses to stimuli, without raising the question of whether the animals concerned understand the meaning of the signals they emit and receive. That is a key question in animal cognition. There are some signalling systems that seem to demand a more advanced understanding. A much discussed example is the use of alarm calls by vervet monkeys. Robert Seyfarth and Dorothy Cheney showed that these animals emit different alarm calls in the presence of different predators (leopards, eagles, and snakes), and the monkeys that hear the calls respond appropriately—but that this ability develops over time, and also takes into account the experience of the individual emitting the call. Metacommunication, discussed above, also seems to require a more sophisticated cognitive process.

====Identity communication====
It has been reported that bottlenose dolphins can recognize identity information from signature whistles even when otherwise stripped of the characteristics of the whistle; making bottlenose dolphins one of the only animals other than humans that have been shown to transmit identity information independent of the caller&#x27;s voice or location. The paper concludes that:
The same researchers later found that common bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;) mothers inflect their signature whistle when their dependent calf is present. Signature whistles, which are in a higher frequency range than humans can hear, have an important role in facilitating mother–calf contact. In the Sarasota Dolphin Research Program&#x27;s library of recordings were 19 female common bottlenose dolphins producing signature whistles both with and without the presence of their calf. In all 19 cases, the mother dolphin inflected the signature whistle when their calf was present, by reaching a higher frequency, or using a wider frequency range. Similarly, humans use higher fundamental frequencies and a wider pitch range to inflect child–directed speech (CDS). This has rarely been discovered in other species. The researchers stated that CDS benefits for humans are cueing the child to pay attention, long-term bonding, and promoting the development of lifelong vocal learning, with parallels in these bottlenose dolphins in an example of convergent evolution.

Other species which can transmit identity information using name-like calls include marmosets and elephants.

===Human behaviour===
Another controversial issue is the extent to which human behaviours resemble animal communication, or whether all such communication has disappeared as a result of our linguistic capacity. Some of our bodily features—eyebrows, beards and moustaches, deep adult male voices, perhaps female breasts—strongly resemble adaptations to producing signals. Ethologists such as Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt have argued that facial gestures such as smiling, grimacing, and the eyebrow flash on greeting are universal human communicative signals that can be related to corresponding signals in other primates. Given how recently spoken language has emerged, it is very likely that human body language does include some more or less involuntary responses that have a similar origin to the communication we have.

Humans also often seek to mimic animals&#x27; communicative signals in order to interact with them. For example, cats have a mild affiliative response of slowly closing their eyes; humans often mimic this signal towards a pet cat to establish a tolerant relationship. Stroking, petting and rubbing pet animals are all actions that probably work through their natural patterns of interspecific communication.

Dogs have shown an ability to understand human communication. In object choice tasks, dogs utilize human communicative gestures such as pointing and direction of gaze in order to locate hidden food and toys. However, in contrast to humans pointing has a different meaning for dogs as it refers to a direction or location. It has also been shown that dogs exhibit a left gaze bias when looking at human faces, indicating that they are capable of reading human emotions. Dogs do not make use of direction of gaze or exhibit left gaze bias with other dogs.

A new approach in the 21st century in the field of animal communication uses applied behavioural analysis, specifically functional communication training. This form of training previously has been used in schools and clinics with humans with special needs, such as children with autism, to help them develop language. Sean Senechal at the AnimalSign Center has been using an approach similar to functional communication training with domesticated animals, such as dogs since 2004 and horses since 2000, with encouraging results and benefits to the animals and people. Functional communication training for animals, Senechal calls &quot;Animal Sign Language&quot;. This includes teaching communication through gestures (like simplified American sign language), Picture Exchange Communication System, tapping, and vocalisation. The process for animals includes simplified and modified techniques.

===Linguistics===

For linguistics, the interest of animal communication systems lies in their similarities to and differences from human language:

# Human languages are characterized for having a double articulation (in the characterization of French linguist André Martinet). It means that complex linguistic expressions can be broken down in meaningful elements (such as morphemes and words), which in turn are composed of smallest phonetic elements that affect meaning, called phonemes. Animal signals, however, do not exhibit this dual structure.
# In general, animal utterances are responses to external stimuli, and do not refer to matters removed in time and space. Matters of relevance at a distance, such as distant food sources, tend to be indicated to other individuals by body language instead, for example wolf activity before a hunt, or the information conveyed in honeybee dance language. It is therefore unclear to what extent utterances are automatic responses and to what extent deliberate intent plays a part.
# In contrast to human language, animal communication systems are usually not able to express conceptual generalizations. (Cetaceans and some primates may be notable exceptions).
# Human languages combine elements to produce new messages (a property known as creativity). One factor in this is that much human language growth is based upon conceptual ideas and hypothetical structures, both being far greater capabilities in humans than animals. This appears far less common in animal communication systems, although current research into animal culture is still an ongoing process with many new discoveries. In 2009 it was reported that affixation may play a role in the call meanings of Campbell&#x27;s mona monkey.

== Errors in communication ==
There becomes possibility for error within communication between animals when certain circumstances apply. These circumstances could include distance between the two communicating subjects, as well as the complexity of the signal that is being communicated to the &quot;listener&quot; of the situation. It may not always be clear to the &quot;listener&quot; where the location of the communication is coming from, as the &quot;singer&quot; can sometimes deceive them and create more error.

<doc id="464453" wikidata="Q2296127" url="?curid=464453" title="Will Rogers phenomenon">
<text>The Will Rogers phenomenon, also rarely called the Okie paradox, is when moving an observation from one group to another increases the average of both groups. It is named after a joke attributed to the comedian Will Rogers about Dust Bowl migration during the Great Depression:

The joke&#x27;s premise is that Okies (Dust Bowl migrants from Oklahoma) were not as bright as the average Oklahoman, but smarter than the average Californian. This quotation was first attributed to native Oklahoman Rogers decades after his death; versions of the same joke with different places and people circulated at least 15 years before it can be linked to Okies.

The apparent paradox comes from the rise in intelligence of both groups, which makes it seem as though intelligence has been &quot;created.&quot; However, the overall population maintains the same average intelligence: moving a person of moderate intelligence out of a high-intelligence group and into a low-intelligence group increases the mean intelligence of both the low- and the high-intelligence groups, while the overall population mean (which is a &quot;weighted&quot; average of the two groups&#x27; intelligence) is unaffected.

==Numerical examples==

Consider the following sets &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;, whose arithmetic mean are 2.5 and 7, respectively.

:formula_1

If 5 is moved from &quot;S&quot; to &quot;R&quot;, then the arithmetic mean of &quot;R&quot; increases to 3, and the arithmetic mean of &quot;S&quot; increases to 7.5, even though the total set of numbers themselves, and therefore their overall average, have not changed.

Consider this more dramatic example, where the arithmetic means of sets &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;, are 1.5 and , respectively:

:formula_2

If 99 is moved from &quot;S&quot; to &quot;R&quot;, then the arithmetic means increase to 34 and . The number 99 is orders of magnitude above 1 and 2, and orders of magnitude below and .

The element which is moved does not have to be the very lowest or highest of its set; it merely has to have a value that lies between the means of the two sets. And the sets themselves can have overlapping ranges. Consider this example:

:formula_3

If 10, which is larger than &quot;R&quot;″s mean of 7 and smaller than &quot;S&quot;″s mean of 12, is moved from &quot;S&quot; to &quot;R&quot;, the arithmetic means still increase slightly, to 7.375 and 12.333.

==General application to subpopulation averaging==
The phenomenon is a potential risk when comparing averages of subpopulations, because the outcome can change depending on how the population is divided rather than on changes of the individuals of the population. By extension, the average of the subpopulation averages would change even though there is no actual change within the population. This effect can result in non-intuitive or objectionable results in Pareto and related utilitarian analysis.

==Cancer stage migration==
One real-world example of the phenomenon is seen in the medical concept of cancer stage migration, which led clinician Alvan Feinstein to coin the term &quot;Will Rogers phenomenon&quot; in 1985, based on a remark by a friend who attributed the quote to Rogers.

In medical stage migration, improved detection of illness leads to the movement of people from the set of healthy people to the set of unhealthy people. Because these people are actually not healthy — merely misclassified as healthy due to an imperfect earlier diagnosis — removing them from the set of healthy people increases the average lifespan of the healthy group. Likewise, the migrated people are healthier than the people already in the unhealthy set: their illness was so minor that only the newer more sensitive test could detect it. Adding them to the unhealthy raises the average lifespan of that group as well. Both lifespans are statistically lengthened, even if early detection of a cancer does not lead to better treatment: because it is detected earlier, more time is lived in the &quot;unhealthy&quot; set of people. In this form, the paradox can be viewed an instance of the equivocation fallacy. Equivocation occurs when one term is used with multiple meanings in order to mislead the listener into unwarranted comparisons, and life span statistics before and after a stage migration use different meanings of &quot;unhealthy&quot;, as the cutoff for detection is different.

<text>Grace Under Pressure is the tenth studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, released April 12, 1984, on Anthem Records. After touring for the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Signals&quot; (1982), came to an end in mid-1983, Rush started work on a follow-up in August. The band had decided not to work with longtime producer Terry Brown, who had collaborated with Rush since 1974. The new material accentuated the group&#x27;s change in direction towards a synthesizer-oriented sound like its previous album. After some difficulty finding a suitable producer who could commit, the album was recorded with Peter Henderson.

&quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; reached number 4 in Canada, number 5 in the UK, and number 10 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was certified platinum in the U.S. for selling one million copies.

==Background and recording==
In July 1983, Rush ended their 1982–1983 tour of North America and the UK in support of their previous album, &quot;Signals&quot; (1982). The group reconvened in mid-August to write and rehearse new material for a follow-up in a lodge in Horseshoe Valley in Barrie, Ontario. The sessions were productive, partly due to the set amount of time they gave themselves to work in and that studio time had already been booked. The band adopted its usual working method of Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson working on music while Neil Peart worked on lyrics. News stories from the Toronto-based newspaper &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; inspired some of the lyrics on the album, particularly &quot;Distant Early Warning,&quot; &quot;Red Lenses&quot; and &quot;Between the Wheels.&quot; Peart wrote that they came up with &quot;Between the Wheels&quot; on the first night and, after a few days, &quot;Kid Gloves&quot; and &quot;Afterimage.&quot; In three weeks, the group had assembled a demo tape of the aforementioned tracks along with &quot;Red Sector A&quot; and &quot;The Body Electric.&quot; Development then paused in September 1983 while Rush performed five nights at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, after which the band resumed album rehearsals.

&quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; is the first Rush album that was not produced by Terry Brown since their self-titled debut effort. During the &quot;Signals&quot; tour in March 1983, Rush met with Brown in Miami to inform him that the band had decided to work with a different producer. The group wished to explore different approaches and techniques that someone else might offer which in turn would develop their sound but stressed that the change did not suggest any dissatisfaction in Brown&#x27;s production. Peart recalled that the split was tough for both parties considering the length of time they had worked together, but that they split on good terms. Brown receives a tribute in the liner notes of &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; in French which translates to &quot;And always our good old friend.&quot;

The search for a new producer began during Rush&#x27;s 1983 European tour, where the band met several candidates during their visit to the UK. They met Steve Lillywhite, who initially agreed to the project, but he backed out two weeks before the band was to start rehearsing, as he&#x27;d decided to work with Simple Minds instead. They had producer Trevor Horn and Yes bassist Chris Squire attend their concert at Wembley Arena with the prospect of choosing one of them to produce. Eventually, the group started pre-production alone, which Peart thought increased the band&#x27;s desire to succeed: &quot;This really drew us together and gave us a strong resolve and a mutual determination to make a really great record.&quot; Rush then met with another English producer during rehearsals who showed promise, but various problems that hindered his availability could not be solved in time. This was followed by the arrival of Englishman Peter Henderson, who the band liked and who agreed to produce and engineer, but his occasional indecisiveness ultimately left the band to handle the majority of the creative decisions themselves. Despite this, Rush and Henderson are credited as co-producers in the liner notes.

After a collection of demos had been worked out, the group entered Le Studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec to record, from November 1983 to March 1984, the longest period Rush had taken to record an album up to this point. The band spent up to 14 hours per day in the studio. In a 1984 interview, Lifeson picked &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; as the &quot;most satisfying of all our records.&quot;

The album&#x27;s title was inspired by a quotation from American novelist Ernest Hemingway. Peart was an avid reader and admirer of Hemingway, and liked the quotation &quot;courage is grace under pressure&quot; as he thought the quote reflected the ambient mood of the album&#x27;s recording sessions.

A music video produced for &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; would be the first played by the Canadian music television channel MuchMusic, which launched in August 1984.

==Music==
The album marks yet another development in Rush&#x27;s sound; while continuing to make extensive use of keyboard synthesizers as on &quot;Signals&quot;, the band also experimented by incorporating elements of ska and reggae into some of the songs. The guitars played a larger role on this record than on &quot;Signals&quot;, with Lifeson stating, &quot;I think the guitar on &quot;Signals&quot; took a bit of a back seat. The keyboards were really upfront ... though in a sense that&#x27;s what we were trying to achieve, we wanted to go for a different perspective on the whole sound. But, possibly, we lost direction at times on &quot;Signals&quot;.&quot; Lifeson also pointed out that there is no acoustic guitar on &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; and the lack of ballad-type songs.

===Songs===
&quot;Afterimage&quot; was written about Robbie Whelan, a tape operator at Le Studio who was killed in a car accident a year prior to the album&#x27;s release. The album was dedicated to his memory.

&quot;Red Sector A&quot; talks about the Holocaust imprisonment camps that were set up during World War II, specifically from the perspective of an unspecified person in the camp.

&quot;The Body Electric&quot; features a guitar solo with an added harmonizing effect with a delay which Lifeson described as &quot;pretty bizarre.&quot;

== Tour ==
The band went on tour for the album from May to November in 1984. In addition, they performed at the Radio City Music Hall in New York, New York during September of 1983 as a warm-up tour. During the 1984 tour, a setlist was made that included every song from the album, with &quot;Afterimage&quot; being swapped occasionally for &quot;Kid Gloves&quot;. The tour was filmed and later released first as the Replay X 3 box set, and then individually on multiple video and audio formats in 1986 as the Grace Under Pressure Tour. This was also the only tour in which (what was then) the &quot;Fear&quot; trilogy was played in full, which included The Enemy Within, The Weapon, and Witch Hunt.

==Artwork==
The cover was designed and painted by Hugh Syme, the creator of all Rush album cover artwork since 1975. The back cover features a band portrait by Armenian-Canadian photographer Yousuf Karsh. The group had decided to employ Karsh when they discussed ideas for the album&#x27;s sleeve during rehearsals in Horseshoe Valley. Lifeson suggested to Peart a black-and-white band photograph, as the band had not done something like that on previous albums. Lee was enthusiastic towards the idea and suggested to use Karsh. Lifeson spoke of the end result: &quot;It&#x27;s definitely not a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll picture, but it&#x27;s a very true, realistic picture of the three of us.&quot; The original vinyl pressing also featured a photo depicting an egg being held in a C-clamp.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; was released in April 1984. It reached No. 4 in Canada, No. 5 in the UK, and No. 10 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was certified platinum in the U.S. for selling one million copies.

Rush filmed promotional videos for &quot;Distant Early Warning,&quot; &quot;Afterimage,&quot; &quot;The Body Electric&quot; and &quot;The Enemy Within.&quot;

&quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine placed the album on their list of &quot;New Sensations: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1984&quot;.

<text>Sheila Fraser (born September 16, 1950) served as Auditor General of Canada from 2001 to 2011.

==Early life and education==
Fraser was born in Dundee, Quebec, Canada to Kenneth Fraser (1917-2005), a Quebec Member of the National Assembly for Huntingdon from 1966 to 1976. She earned a Bachelor of Commerce from McGill University&#x27;s Desautels Faculty of Management in 1972. She then became a chartered accountant in 1974 and FCA in 1994. In 1981, she worked for Ernst and Young where she worked on assignment to the Auditor General of Quebec in some cases, and other Quebec government offices.

==Auditor General of Canada==
In January 1999, she joined the Office of the Auditor General of Canada as Deputy Auditor General, Audit Operations. She was subsequently appointed Auditor General in 2001. Her 10-year mandate as Auditor General ended on May 30, 2011. During her time in office, a Reader&#x27;s Digest poll listed her as one of the top five most trusted Canadians.

She made headlines across Canada when her report on the sponsorship scandal rocked the country&#x27;s political scene. She confirmed serious problems in the federal government&#x27;s management of its Sponsorship Program for a four-year period beginning in 1997. In a few very troubling cases, sponsorship funds were transferred to Crown corporations using what the Auditor General called &quot;highly questionable methods.&quot; That is, they appeared to have been designed to pay significant commissions to communications agencies, while hiding the source of funding and the true nature of the transactions. Parliament and the parliamentary appropriations process were not respected.

The Auditor General made the news again on November 26, 2006, with her report on the former ombudsman of federal inmates. The report made a series of allegations that the former ombudsman, Ron Stewart, had &quot;often skipped work and collected $325,000 in improper or questionable salary, vacation pay and expenses during his 14-year tenure&quot;. The case is currently being reviewed by the RCMP to determine if criminal charges are warranted.

During the week of January 18 to 22, 2010, Fraser visited Afghanistan to observe the military and development progress of the Canadian mission there. She expressed concern for the fate of the projects and the training of Afghan police and military, after Canada is scheduled to leave in 2011.

She gave her last public speech, on May 25, 2011, at the Canadian Club of Ottawa, entitled &quot;Serving Parliament Through a Decade of Change&quot;, where she warned the government faces long-term fiscal pressures that will mean &quot;very hard choices&quot; between raising taxes or cutting programs and encouraged the government to publicize its long-term fiscal projections because &quot;without them, we cannot begin to understand the scale and complexity of our financial challenges and the implication of policy choices.&quot;. Fraser also criticized the &quot;truly shocking&quot; lack of improvement on First Nations reserves and also said &quot;I actually think it&#x27;s quite tragic when you see that there is a population in this country that does not have the sort of basic services that Canadians take for granted.&quot;. She also referred to the Sponsorship scandal as &quot;a pivotal event with a lasting impact&quot; and &quot;broke just about every rule in the book&quot;.

==Other business positions==
Fraser was appointed to the board of directors at Manulife in November 2011.

==Honours==
Sheila Fraser received an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Waterloo in October 2005.

==Family==
She is divorced and has three children.

Her grandfather&#x27;s cousin, John Fraser, also served as Auditor General of Canada.

<text>Sharjah International Airport () is an international airport located east-southeast of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. It is spread over an area of . It has one runway, and is the only airport in Sharjah capable of international flights as of 2022. By 2027, it is expected to increase its capacity to 25 million passengers annually.

==Overview==
Sharjah International Airport is the third largest Middle East air freight hub in cargo tonnage, according to official 2015 statistics from Airports Council International. Ground services company, Sharjah Aviation Services, handled 586,195 tonnes in 2015 – a 16.1% increase year on year. It has one passenger terminal with an area of .

Sharjah International Airport is home base of the low-cost carrier Air Arabia. The headquarters of Air Arabia is in the Sharjah Freight Center, on the property of the airport in Sharjah, UAE. The center is an old cargo terminal.

It was the first airport in UAE and the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, for use by Imperial Airways, and was subsequently used by the RAF until 14 December 1971. The reason for the move was development pressure from the city of Sharjah. The old terminal and tower building is now Al Mahatta Museum. The old airport&#x27;s runway is now part of King Abdul Aziz Street in the city centre.

The airport was used by the United States Air Force 926th Tactical Fighter Group during Operation Desert Shield/Storm. Approximately 450 members of the unit were stationed at the airport, which flew A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft during the conflict in late 1990 and early 1991.

==Facilities==
The airport is at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 12/30 with an asphalt surface measuring .

Founded in 1985, Sharjah Airport Travel Agency is owned by the Sharjah Airport Authority, Government of Sharjah and has 14 branches in the UAE, including one on the first floor of the main terminal at Sharjah Airport.

There are two prayer rooms available, one in the transit area of the Arrivals Terminal and the other on the ground floor of the Departures Terminal. There are mosques in both the East and West Cargo Terminals 3 and 4.

<doc id="464472" wikidata="Q1753154" url="?curid=464472" title="The Principle of Evil Made Flesh">
<text>The Principle of Evil Made Flesh is the debut studio album by English extreme metal band Cradle of Filth. It was released on 24 February 1994 through Cacophonous Records, following three demos released between 1991 and 1993. The album&#x27;s sound is significantly more raw than on subsequent releases, and frontman Dani Filth&#x27;s vocals differ from his later style and technique. The album is a then-unusual hybrid of gothic metal and black metal. This would be the only album featuring guitarist Paul Ryan and keyboardist Benjamin Ryan; guitarist Paul Allender also left the band at this point, but returned five years later for &quot;Midian&quot;.

Some of the tracks from this album were later re-recorded for &quot;V Empire&quot; (1996), &quot;Bitter Suites to Succubi&quot; (2001), and &quot;Midnight in the Labyrinth&quot; (2012).

== Musical style ==
In the book &quot;The Gospel of Filth&quot;, Gavin Baddeley describes the album and its place within (or alongside) the contemporary black metal scene:

&quot;Principle&quot; did share several characteristics with the Scandinavian black metal emerging at the time, above and beyond the kindred fascination with all things dark and devilish. Cradle&#x27;s debut is their rawest recording, chiming with the crude underproduction now demanded by black metal purists (though how much of that rawness was due to inexperience and budgetary limitations is another matter). It&#x27;s still the only Cradle of Filth recording accepted as &quot;true&quot; black metal by many in the murkier corners of the underground... [but] there were as many things separating Cradle of Filth from the emerging black metal pack as they had in common. Just as important to Cradle&#x27;s developing identity as the metal bands they grew up with in the 1980s and their contemporaries in the &#x27;90s was the dark verse and literature of the 1880s and &#x27;90s, produced by the artistic deviants of the day, known as the Decadents... Under the icy influence of the Norwegians, black metal had become a nihilistic, savage world of darkness and suffering, with little space for sensuality... Cradle pioneered a slick gothic image, emphasising the seductive aspects of the dark side...

John Serba of AllMusic described the album&#x27;s musical style:

Utilizing flowery classical flourishes, tangible melodies, nimble death/thrash riffing, a coherent—albeit crushing—rhythmic battery and the deranged, multifaceted caterwaul of vocalist Dani Davey, &quot;The Principle of Evil Made Flesh&quot; brought a musical sensibility to the black metal table that was absent in early genre releases by Emperor, Enslaved and Mayhem. Boasting a blatant goth influence—i.e., lengthy keyboard intros, intermittent operatic female vocals, Davey&#x27;s black &#x27;n&#x27; blood take on romantic poetry [...] and slightly tongue-in-cheek vampire and occult imagery—Cradle came across as a lean combination of key influences, including Venom, Iron Maiden, Bathory, Possessed, Celtic Frost and Slayer, all spot-welded to the miscreant clatterings of Norway&#x27;s finest.

He further commented that &quot;&quot;Principle&quot; made waves in the early black metal scene, putting Cradle of Filth on the tips of metalheads&#x27; tongues, whether in praise of the band&#x27;s brazen attempts to break the black metal mold or in derision for its &#x27;commercialization&#x27; of an underground phenomenon that was proud of its grimy heritage […].&quot;

Speaking to Ryan Bird of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in 2008, Dani Filth remembered the following: 

== Lyrical content ==
Despite comments made by backing vocalist Andrea Meyer styling herself the band&#x27;s &quot;Satanic advisor&quot;, the album&#x27;s lyrics make scant mention of Satan or Satanism. Specific references only appear on the intro track &quot;Darkness Our Bride&quot; (the chant &quot;Agios o Satanas&quot;), and indirectly on the track &quot;Of Mist and Midnight Skies&quot; (a line about &quot;Satanic decree&quot;). Paul Ryan&#x27;s credit in the sleeve notes is for &quot;Satanic war noise&quot;, however, and the lyrics do express anti-religious sentiments throughout, in tracks such as &quot;The Forest Whispers My Name&quot; and &quot;A Crescendo of Passion Bleeding&quot;.

The album contains many mythological and occult references, encompassing Set, the Valkyrie, Hecate, Baphomet, Artemis, Bastet, Astarte, Ishtar, Khem, Al-Uzza, Eve, Aleister Crowley (through quotation of &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot;), Diana and Lilith. The sleeve also quotes Hegel, Swinburne and Hitler (&quot;Weltmacht oder Niedergang&quot;). Dani Filth explained the album&#x27;s overwhelmingly female pantheon in &quot;The Gospel of Filth&quot;:

The personification of evil as a woman comes down to a really simple equation with me. If you&#x27;re going to write very intimately about a character, I&#x27;d rather be intimate with a woman... I&#x27;d rather worship a female entity than a male one. If God&#x27;s representative on Earth was male, it seems logical to me that the opposite would be female, especially with the traditional symbolic association between femininity and the moon. In a sense, we venerate woman as the author of original sin, and therefore, the reason for man straying from God...

Sixteen years on from &quot;Principle&quot;, Lilith reappeared as the central character of Cradle of Filth&#x27;s 2010 concept album &quot;Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa&quot;.

== Album art ==
The cover is a stock image from Nigel Wingrove&#x27;s Redemption portfolio. The CD booklet also features a Baphomet pentagram and a more traditional pentagram graphic, as well as photos of the band members wearing corpse paint, inverted cross necklaces and T-shirts featuring the black metal acts Marduk and Darkthrone.

== Critical reception ==
AllMusic wrote, &quot;&quot;Principle&quot;, in retrospect, doesn&#x27;t quite live up to the quality control exhibited on later records, the album leaving plenty of room for the group to grow into its studded S&amp;M gear. Too often, Dani&#x27;s vocals are reduced to generic death-puking or heavy-handed, Tom Warrior-style monotone narration, and the spiky guitar riffs of the title track and &#x27;A Crescendo of Passion Bleeding&#x27; are relatively primitive by CoF standards.&quot;

<doc id="464474" wikidata="Q477460" url="?curid=464474" title="USS Sangamon (CVE-26)">
<text>USS &quot;Sangamon&quot; (CVE-26) was a US Navy escort carrier of World War II.

Originally Esso Trenton, a T3 tanker oiler, built by the Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, it was operated by Standard Oil of New Jersey on runs from gulf coast ports to the east coast. After entering service in the early part of the war in the Navy as a tanker, &quot;Sangamon&quot; was converted into an aircraft carrier.

After conversion &quot;Sangamon&quot; was at the Allied invasion of French North Africa in 1943 before moving to the war in the Pacific. Post war it was sold into civilian ownership and scrapped in 1960.

== Service history ==
&quot;Esso Trenton&quot; was acquired by the United States Navy on 22 October 1940. Renamed Sangamon and designated a fleet oiler, one of 12 oilers, she was commissioned on 23 October 1940.

After service off the west coast and in Hawaiian waters, &quot;Sangamon&quot; shifted to the Atlantic Fleet in the spring of 1941, and through the Neutrality Patrol period, carried fuel from the gulf coast oil ports to bases on the east coast, in Canada, and in Iceland. On 7 December 1941, when the U.S. entered World War II, she was at Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, offloading her liquid cargo. Within the week, she started south again to renew her schedule on a tighter time frame.

In early 1942, she was designated for conversion to an auxiliary aircraft carrier. On 11 February, she arrived in Hampton Roads. Three days later, she was reclassified AVG-26; and on 25 February, she was decommissioned and conversion was begun at the Norfolk Navy Yard.

During the spring and summer, the need for auxiliary carriers, later called escort carriers, increased. Work on &quot;Sangamon&quot;, three other &quot;Cimarron&quot;-class oilers, and 20 C-3 merchant hulls was continued and sped up. In August, &quot;Sangamon&quot; – the first of her class of escort carriers – was ready. Her conversion had added a flight deck long and wide, elevators, a hangar deck, an aircraft catapult, sonar gear, aircraft ordnance magazines, workshops, and stowage space for aviation spares. Her accommodations had been enlarged to house her increased complement and embarked aviation personnel, and her armament had been changed to two 5&quot;/51 caliber guns, eight 40 mm guns, and twelve 20 mm cannons to increase her anti-aircraft defense. On 20 August, she was redesignated ACV-26; and five days later, she was recommissioned.

&quot;Sangamon&quot; and her three sister T3 conversions were considered very successful escort-carrier designs, larger and more stable than the smaller C3-derived ; additionally, they retained substantial oil bunkerage, useful in refueling destroyers in company. The late-war purpose-built escort carriers were derived from the &quot;Sangamon&quot;s.

=== Operation Torch ===

Shakedown in Chesapeake Bay and off Bermuda followed a return to the yard for repair and improvements to her ventilation system, and on 25 October she sailed east with Task Force 34 (TF 34) to provide air cover for Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa. Assigned to the Northern Support Force, she arrived off Port Lyautey on 8 November. Prior to and during the landings, and subsequent action, her air group, Composite Squadron 26 (VC-26) flew combat air patrol (CAP), anti-submarine patrol (ASP), and ground support missions. At mid-month, she got underway to return to Norfolk, Virginia, whence, after repairs, she sailed for Panama and the Pacific.

===1943===
By mid-January 1943, &quot;Sangamon&quot; had arrived at Éfaté, New Hebrides. As a unit of Carrier Division 22 (CarDiv 22), she operated in the New Caledonia—New Hebrides—Solomon Islands area for the next eight months. With and , she provided protection for resupply convoys &quot;en route&quot; to Guadalcanal and for the assault forces moving on the Russell Islands.

Captain E. P. Moore took over as captain on 5 April 1943. Redesignated CVE-26 on 15 July 1943, &quot;Sangamon&quot; shifted her base of operations from Efate to Espiritu Santo in August, and, in September, she returned to the United States for an overhaul at Mare Island. There she received more modern equipment for her flight deck and a combat information center.

On 19 October, she departed San Diego with VC-37 embarked and sailed for Espiritu Santo. She got underway from the latter on 13 November, rendezvoused with Task Force 53 the next day, and on 20 October arrived in the Gilberts to support the assault on Tarawa Atoll. During the first two days of this operation, her planes struck enemy positions on the island. Then, through 6 December, they were sent out on CAP and ASP missions to protect the escort carrier group and the target area.

===1944===
The escort carrier then set course to return to San Diego. In early January 1944, she trained off southern California, and on 13 January sailed west. Steaming via Pearl Harbor, she pushed on toward her next amphibious operation, the assault on Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands.

At 16:51 on 25 January, during routine flight operations, an F6F-3 (Bureau number 40845) from VF-37 piloted by Lt. R.A. Mayo failed to hook a wire on landing, broke through the barriers, and crashed into parked planes on the forward flight deck. Its belly tank, torn loose, skidded forward, spewing flaming fuel. Fire soon spread among the planes. It raged along the flight deck and flames beat up over the bridge, making ship control extremely difficult. The former oiler was turned out of the wind, so that the fire could be fought. By 16:59, it was under control. Seven of the crew died in those eight minutes. Seven others were seriously injured, and of the 15 who jumped over the side to escape the flames, 13 were picked up, two were missing.

====Palaus====
Temporary repairs were made at sea, and from 31 January to mid-February, &quot;Sangamon&quot; supported the assault and occupation of Kwajalein. She then moved on to Enewetak, where her planes covered the landing forces from 17 to 24 February. On the latter date, she departed the Marshalls and headed back to Pearl Harbor to complete repairs. Captain M. E. Browder flew aboard on 1 March to relieve Captain Moore and assume command.

On 15 March, the CVE got underway again. Departing Hawaii, she rendezvoused with Task Group 50.15 (TG 50.15) – the fast carrier force support group – on 26 March. For the remainder of the month and into April she escorted that group as it operated north of the Admiralty Islands to refuel and resupply the fast carrier force after it had conducted strikes on the Palaus. In early April, &quot;Sangamon&quot; retired to Espiritu Santo and at mid-month, sailed for New Guinea. Briefly attached to the 7th Fleet, she covered the landing at Aitape from 22 to 24 April; retired to Manus Island for two days, then returned to the Aitape area where she conducted patrols until 5 May.

&quot;Sangamon&quot; then returned to Espiritu Santo, whence she departed on 19 May. Rehearsals for the Marianas campaign followed, and on 2 June, she sailed for the Marshalls. Rendezvousing with TF 53 &quot;en route&quot;, she covered that force to Kwajalein, then to the Mariana Islands. From 17 to 20 June, she guarded the force as it steamed to the east of Saipan as a backup force for TF 52, which was then engaged in the assault on, and the occupation of, the island.

After the Battle of the Philippine Sea, &quot;Sangamon&quot; was detached from TF 53. On 21 June, she joined TF 52, and into July conducted operations in support of the occupation of Saipan. On 4 July, she steamed for Eniwetok; arrived on 7 July; and sortied again on 10 July. From 13 July – 1 August, she covered the bombardment groups engaged in the capture of Guam. On 4 August, she returned to Eniwetok, where on 9 August she proceeded to Manus where she was anchored for almost a month.

On 9 September, &quot;Sangamon&quot; departed Seeadler Harbor and steamed for Morotai. There, from 15 to 27 September, she again covered Allied assault forces. After the initial waves had landed, her planes shifted from combat support to bombing and strafing missions to destroy Japanese airfields on nearby Halmahera.

====Philippines====
&quot;Sangamon&quot; again anchored in Seeadler Harbor on 1 October. Twelve days later, she sortied with TG 77.4, the escort carrier group of the Leyte invasion force. That group, composed of 18 escort carriers, was broken down into Task Units 77.4.1, 77.4.2, and 77.4.3 (TU 77.4.1, 77.4.2, and 77.4.3), and referred to as &quot;Taffy 1, 2, and 3&quot;, respectively. During the operation, they would steam to the east of Leyte Gulf: Taffy 1, including &quot;Sangamon&quot;, was off northern Mindanao, Taffy 2 off the entrance to Leyte Gulf; and Taffy 3 off Samar.

Prior to the 20 October landings on Leyte, &quot;Sangamon&quot; launched regular flights in support of the advance units of the invasion force and sent strikes against Leyte and Visayan airfields. On the 20th, her planes covered the landing forces and the ships in the transport areas. That day, she also came under enemy air attack and took a hit at the main deck level. The bomb, dropped by an A6M5 Zero, tore a section of plating loose, then fell into the sea and exploded some away from the &quot;jeep&quot; carrier.

Enemy airfields again became &quot;Sangamon&quot;″s primary targets in the days immediately following the landings. On 24 October, however, her planes fought off waves of Japanese aircraft over the landing area. Early on 25 October, two flights took off: one toward the Mindanao Sea to locate and finish off Japanese survivors of the Battle of Surigao Strait, the other toward Leyte for CAP missions. About an hour later, &quot;Sangamon&quot; received word that Taffy 3, to the north, had been attacked by the Japanese Center Force which had transited San Bernardino Strait during the night.

====Battle off Samar====
Within a half-hour, &quot;Sangamon&quot;″s CAP flight had been diverted to Samar and she had launched another smaller group to further aid the attacked unit. Soon thereafter, however, at about 07:40, as Taffy 1 planes were being recovered, rearmed, and launched, the unit became the target of the first strike of the &quot;kamikaze&quot;.

 took the first hit, and as her flight and hangar decks blazed, &quot;Suwannee&quot; was attacked. Antiaircraft fire from that CVE scored on the planes, which then dived toward &quot;Sangamon&quot;. A shell from &quot;Suwannee&quot; finished one plane only from &quot;Sangamon&quot;. By 07:55, had joined the fight, and – as &quot;Santee&quot;″s crew brought her fires under control – sent a torpedo into that luckless CVE. Minutes later, &quot;Suwannee&quot; was hit by a Zero forward of the after elevator.

During the intense fighting, several of &quot;Sangamon&quot;″s crew were injured and one was killed by strafing fire. Later in the morning, as the attacks fell off, she sent medical personnel to assist casualties of the damaged ships, then began bringing them aboard for treatment. At mid-day, she suffered malfunctions in her steering gear, electric generators, and catapult, but repairs were completed in time for her to launch afternoon strikes as scheduled. Those flights gave chase to the retreating Japanese Center Force.

On 26 October, &quot;Sangamon&quot; recovered her scattered planes and again launched CAP flights. At 12:15, however, enemy planes were reported coming in from the north. Several broke through the air defenses, and &quot;Suwanee&quot; suffered another &quot;kamikaze&quot; hit. On 29 October, the escort carriers retired.

===1945===

====Ryukyus====
&quot;Sangamon&quot; returned to the United States for an overhaul at Bremerton, Washington that took from 30 November 1944 – 24 January 1945. During the overhaul, additional rocket stowage racks, a second catapult, improved radar gear, new 40 mm gun mounts, a bomb elevator, and additional fire-fighting equipment were installed. In mid-February Sangamon moved to Hawai to train a new squadron, VC-33, which included night fighters. On 16 March she arrived at Ulithi where she was temporarily detached from her division to join TU 52.1.1, one of the escort carrier groups assigned to the initial assault phase of Operation Iceberg, the invasion of the Ryukyu Islands.

On 21 March, &quot;Sangamon&quot; departed Ulithi with other ships assigned to the Kerama Retto assault force. Covering the force &quot;en route&quot;, she operated to the south of Okinawa and launched planes for CAP and landing force support as Kerama Retto was secured. On 1 April, as the landings on the Hagushi beaches of Okinawa were taking place, she shifted to TU 52.1.3, thus rejoining CarDiv 22. Through 8 April, however, she continued to launch supporting strikes and patrol groups from an area some south of Okinawa.

On 9 April, she moved with her unit into an area east of Sakishima Gunto. From there, her planes raided airfields on Miyako and Ishigaki. Detached on 12 April, she again provided air support for the forces fighting on Okinawa, then covered the occupation of Ie-shima. On 18 April, she returned to Sakishima Islands. Dawn and dusk strikes were launched daily, and heckler flights were sent over the fields at night. On 22 April, eight fighters and four bombers of a dusk strike caught 25–30 enemy planes warming up on Nobara Field, central Miyako. Seven Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;Oscars&quot; attempted to intercept &quot;Sangamon&quot;″s planes, but the attack was pressed home. After the bombers delivering their loads, the fighters engaged the &quot;Oscars&quot; and shot down five. Night fighters from &quot;Sangamon&quot; were diverted to the area and arrived as four more Oscars joined the fight; two of the four were shot down.

====Kamikaze====
Through the end of the month, &quot;Sangamon&quot; continued to launch her planes to neutralize Japanese airfields. On 4 May, she put into Kerama Retto to rearm. Loading, frequently interrupted by the presence of bogies in the area, was not completed until evening. At 18:30, the CVE got underway. Japanese attackers, however, were soon reported only some off. Land-based fighters were vectored out to intercept the enemy planes and shot down nine. One got through and, at about 19:00, began circling toward a position on &quot;Sangamon&quot;″s port quarter. The escort carrier went into a hard left turn to avoid the enemy and to maneuver into a position to launch her aircraft. She then opened fire and was joined by her escorts. The enemy crashed into the water some off the starboard beam.

Other enemy aircraft followed the first. At 19:25, another broke through the interceptor screen, ran into clouds to avoid anti-aircraft fire, then came out and, with increased speed, headed for &quot;Sangamon&quot;. At 19:33, the &quot;kamikaze&quot; dropped his bomb and crashed into the center of the flight deck. The bomb and parts of the plane penetrated the deck and exploded below. Initial damage was extensive, fires broke out on the flight deck, the hangar deck, and in the fuel deck, communications from the bridge were lost within 15 minutes, and the ship was soon out of control.

The action of &quot;Sangamon&quot; swinging through the wind caused the flames and smoke to change direction, spreading the fires. By 20:15, however, steering control had been established, and the ship was brought back to a course which helped the crew fight the many fires. But water pressure was low, as the firemain and risers had ruptured. Carbon dioxide bottles were brought into action. Nearby ships came alongside to assist. By 22:30, all fires were under control. Communication with other units had been regained; at first through the radio of , then by using a VHF channel in the sole remaining aircraft aboard. At 23:20, &quot;Sangamon&quot; – with 11 dead, 25 missing, and 21 seriously wounded – got underway to return to Kerama Retto for temporary repairs.

From Kerama Retto, &quot;Sangamon&quot; proceeded via Ulithi and Pearl Harbor to Norfolk, Virginia, for repairs. Work was suspended with the cessation of hostilities in mid-August. She was decommissioned on 24 October and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 November.

==Fate==
She was subsequently sold to Hillcone Steamship Company, San Francisco, and was delivered to that company&#x27;s representative at Norfolk on 11 February 1948. She passed through multiple owners through the 1950s, and ultimately was scrapped in Osaka, Japan starting in August 1960.

==Awards==
&quot;Sangamon&quot; earned eight battle stars during World War II. Her three air groups were each awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.

<text>The Tanana Valley is a lowland region in central Alaska in the United States, on the north side of the Alaska Range, where the Tanana River emerges from the mountains. Traditional inhabitants of the valley are Tanana Athabaskans of Alaskan Athabaskans.

==Climate==
The region experiences great extremes of temperature during the year. During the winter months, the air is prone to stratification due to temperature inversions, leading to thick fogs. At the same time, a katabatic wind called the &quot;Tanana Valley Jet&quot; can form, blowing from the southeast to the northwest. During the summer, the surrounding plains are generally boglike, and include much permafrost and many pingos.

==Communities==
The Tanana Valley is the most populated area of Alaska north of the Alaska Range. Its largest city is Fairbanks. Other communities include:

*College
*Chena Hot Springs
*Eielson AFB
*Ester
*Fort Wainwright
*Fox
*Manley Hot Springs
*Nenana
*North Pole
*Tok
*Two Rivers
*Pleasant Valley
*Salcha

==Archaeology==
According to James Q. Jacobs, Tanana Valley has the earliest evidence of human occupation in Alaska.
&quot;At least three distinct lithic complexes appear in the Alaskan archaeological record at approximately the same time, between 12,060 and 11,660 B.P. The earliest firm evidence of human occupation is in the Tanana Valley in Alaska. At the Broken Mammoth, Swan Point, Mead, and Healy Lake, Alaska sites, the oldest dates range between 12,060 BP and 11,410. These sites contain cultural remains considered ancestral to today&#x27;s Alaskan Native inhabitants.

The oldest stratified sites in the Nenana Valley region date to from 11,820 to 11,010 BP.

The Mesa complex in northern Alaska dates to 11,660 BP.&quot;
More recently, Tanana Valley sites have been dated to pre-Clovis period, or 13,000–14,000 cal yr BP.

===Sites===
The Broken Mammoth site, the Swan Point Archaeological Site, and the Mead Archaeological Site are the earliest dated sites in Alaska. They are located along the Tanana River.

<text>The Ghost Festival or Hungry Ghost Festival, also known as the Zhongyuan Festival in Taoism and the Yulanpen Festival in Buddhism, is a traditional festival held in certain East and Southeast Asian countries. According to the Lunar calendar (a lunisolar calendar), the Ghost Festival is on the 15th night of the seventh month (14th in parts of southern China). 

In Chinese culture, the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the lunar calendar is called Ghost Day or (especially in Taiwan) Pudu () and the seventh month is generally regarded as the Ghost Month, in which ghosts and spirits, including those of deceased ancestors, come out from the lower realm (&quot;diyu&quot; or &quot;preta&quot;). Distinct from both the Qingming Festival (or Tomb Sweeping Day, in spring) and Double Ninth Festival (in autumn) in which living descendants pay homage to their deceased ancestors, during Ghost Festival, the deceased are believed to visit the living.

On the fifteenth day the realms of Heaven and Hell and the realm of the living are open and both Taoists and Buddhists would perform rituals to transmute and absolve the sufferings of the deceased. Intrinsic to the Ghost Month is veneration of the dead, where traditionally the filial piety of descendants extends to their ancestors even after their deaths. Activities during the month would include preparing ritualistic food offerings, burning incense, and burning joss paper, a papier-mâché form of material items such as clothes, gold, and other fine goods for the visiting spirits of the ancestors. Elaborate meals (often vegetarian) would be served with empty seats for each of the deceased in the family treating the deceased as if they are still living. Ancestor worship is what distinguishes Qingming Festival from Ghost Festival because the latter includes paying respects to all deceased, including the same and younger generations, while the former only includes older generations. Other festivities may include buying and releasing miniature paper boats and lanterns on water, which signifies giving directions to the lost ghosts and spirits of the ancestors and other deities.

==Origins==
The name relates to the concept of the hungry ghost, the Chinese translation of the term &quot;preta&quot; in Buddhism. It plays a role in Chinese Buddhism and Taoism as well as in Chinese folk religion, and represents beings who were originally living people, who have died, and who are driven by intense emotional needs in an animalistic way.

As a Taoist festival: Taoism has the &quot;Three Yuan&quot; theory (representing the Three Great Emperor-Officials), which the name &quot;Zhong Yuan&quot; comes from. The festival flourished during the Tang dynasty, whose rulers were partial to Taoism; and &quot;Zhongyuan&quot; became well established as the holiday&#x27;s name.

As a Buddhist festival: The origin story of the modern Ghost Festival, ultimately originated from ancient India, deriving from the Mahayana scripture known as the Yulanpen or Ullambana Sutra. The sutra records the time when Maudgalyāyana achieves abhijñā and uses his newfound powers to search for his deceased parents. Maudgalyayana discovers that his deceased mother was reborn into the preta or hungry ghost realm. She was in a wasted condition and Maudgalyayana tried to help her by giving her a bowl of rice. Unfortunately as a preta, she was unable to eat the rice as it was transformed into burning coal. Maudgalyayana then asks the Buddha to help him; whereupon Buddha explains how one is able to assist one&#x27;s current parents and deceased parents in this life and in one&#x27;s past seven lives by willingly offering food, etc., to the sangha or monastic community during Pravarana (the end of the monsoon season or vassa), which usually occurs on the 15th day of the seventh month whereby the monastic community transfers the merits to the deceased parents, etc., 

The Theravadan forms of the festival in South and Southeast Asia (including Cambodia&#x27;s Pchum Ben) are much older, deriving from the Petavatthu, a scripture in the Pali Canon that probably dates to the 3rdcenturyBC. The Petavatthu account is broadly similar to that later recorded in the Yulanpen Sutra, although it concerns the disciple Sāriputta and his family rather than Moggallāna.

==Observance==

The Ghost Festival is held during the seventh month of the Chinese calendar. It also falls at the same time as a full moon, the new season, the fall harvest, the peak of Buddhist monastic asceticism, the rebirth of ancestors, and the assembly of the local community. During this month, the gates of hell are opened up and ghosts are free to roam the earth where they seek food and entertainment. These ghosts are believed to be spirits of those without descendants (or, traditionally, without descendants in the male line) or whose descendants did not pay tribute to them after they died. They are desperately hungry, thirsty, and restless as a result. Family members offer food and drink to the ghosts and burn hell bank notes and other forms of joss paper. Joss paper items are believed to have value in the afterlife, considered to be very similar in some aspects to the material world. Families pay tribute to wandering ghosts of strangers so that these homeless souls do not intrude on their lives and bring misfortune. A large feast is held for the ghosts on the day of the ghost festival or thereabouts, when people bring samples of food and place them on an altar or outside a temple or house, to please the ghosts and ward off bad luck. Lotus-shaped lanterns are lit and set afloat in rivers to symbolically guide lost souls to the afterlife.

In some East Asian countries today, live performances are held and everyone is invited to attend. The first row of seats are always empty as this is where the ghosts sit. The shows are always put on at night and at high volumes as the sound is believed to attract and please the ghosts. Some shows include Chinese opera, dramas, and in some areas, even burlesque shows. Traditionally Chinese opera was the main source of entertainment but the newer shows, concerts, dramas, wars, and so forth are referred to as Getai. These acts are better known as &quot;Merry-making&quot;.

For rituals, Buddhists and Taoists hold ceremonies to relieve ghosts from suffering, many of them holding ceremonies in the afternoon or at night (as it is believed that the ghosts are released from hell when the sun sets). Altars are built for the deceased and priests and monks alike perform rituals for the benefit of ghosts. Monks and priests often throw rice or other small foods into the air in all directions to distribute them to the ghosts.

During the evening, incense is burnt in front of the doors of households. Incense stands for prosperity in Chinese culture, so families believe that there is more prosperity in burning more incense. During the festival, some shops are closed as they want to leave the streets open for the ghosts. In the middle of each street stands an altar of incense with fresh fruit and sacrifices displayed on it.

Fourteen days after the festival, to make sure all the hungry ghosts find their way back to hell, people float water lanterns and set them outside their houses. These lanterns are made by setting a lotus flower-shaped lantern on a paper boat. The lanterns are used to direct the ghosts back to the underworld, and when they go out, it symbolizes that they have found their way back.

==Celebrations in other parts of Asia==

=== Singapore and Malaysia ===
Concert-like performances are a prominent feature of the Ghost Festival in Singapore and Malaysia. Those live concerts are popularly known as Getai in Mandarin () or &quot;Koh-tai&quot; (Hokkien ). They are performed by groups of singers, dancers, entertainers, and opera troops or puppet shows on a temporary stage that is set up within a residential district. The festival is funded by the residents of each individual district. During these &quot;Getai&quot; the front row is left empty for the special guests—the ghosts. It is known to be bad luck to sit on the front row of red seats, if anyone were to sit on them, they would become sick or similarly ailed.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, the festival is popularly known as &quot;Chit Gwee Pua&quot; (Hokkien ) or &quot;Chit Nyiat Pan&quot; (Hakka ; Pha̍k-fa-sṳ:&quot;Chhit-ngie̍t-pan&quot;), &quot;Cioko&quot;, or &quot;Sembahyang Rebutan&quot; in Indonesian (Scrambling prayer). Observers gather around temples and bring an offering to a spirit who died in an unlucky way, and after that, they distribute it to the poor. The way people scramble the offerings is the origin of the festival name, and the festival is mostly known in Java Island. Other areas like North Sumatra, Riau, and Riau islands also conduct live concerts known as &quot;Getai&quot; (Mandarin ) like those in Malaysia and Singapore, and there are also times when observers conduct Tomb sweeping known as &quot;Sembahyang Kubur&quot; to respect ancestor spirits and garner luck. This is done by buying hell notes or &quot;Kim Cua&quot; (Hokkien ) and paper-based goods like paper house, paper horse, paper car, etc., which will end up being burned as it is believed that burned goods will be sent to help the spirits feel better in afterlife.

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, the occasion is more popularly known as &quot;Ghost Month&quot;, as it affects the entire seventh lunar month of the Chinese calendar around August to September (which coincided with the month of the Immaculate Heart of Mary). The month-long observances are mostly traditionally practiced and originated by Chinese Filipinos which its observance has since spread to other Filipinos that have become aware of it, since it reverberates economically through the stock market as a sizable amount of investors stop investing and put off their investments for later dates past the occasion. Generally, those who observe it find it to be a very unlucky time of the year, as traditional belief states that the souls of dead relatives, wandering souls or vengeful spirits roam the earth during the month-long occasion. This means that practitioners take extra precautions and caution others of making important decisions when it comes to relationships, professions, businesses, and finances. People avoid practices like, making life-changing decisions, getting married or engaged, starting new businesses, moving to a new home, traveling, signing contracts, making impulsive major financial decisions, committing to big professional projects, inaugurations, buying or selling off high priced possessions such as cars, phones, or real estate properties, staying late out at night especially kids and elderlies, making noise or whistling at night, leaving food or hanging clothes out after sunset and leaving them overnight since their human-like shape may invite spirits, or even taking pictures at night, wearing black clothes, tapping people on the head or shoulders as it may affect their luck, picking up coins or strange items you find since these may belong to the dead, or even constantly talking to oneself, or going to cemeteries alone, or answering unknown whispers or sobbing, or being constantly close to bodies of water, or constantly talking about ghosts or death. Besides these many avoidances, practitioners also make offerings and prayers for the souls of the dead, such as burning spirit money, lighting incense, and laying out food like fruits and drinks on home or temple altars or cemetery tombs or graves or mausoleums of deceased relatives that people during this month also start to visit. Some people also start to hold memorial services to deceased relatives or ancestors held either at home or at a Chinese temple, a church or funeral home.

===Taiwan===
Traditionally, it is believed that ghosts haunt the island of Taiwan for the entire seventh lunar month, when the mid-summer &quot;Ghost Festival&quot; is held. The month is known as &quot;Ghost Month&quot;. The first day of the month is marked by opening the gate of a temple, symbolizing the gates of hell. On the twelfth day, lamps on the main altar are lit. On the thirteenth day, a procession of lanterns is held. On the fourteenth day, a parade is held for releasing water lanterns. Incense and food are offered to the spirits to deter them from visiting homes and spirit paper money is also burnt as an offering. During the month, people avoid surgery, buying cars, swimming, moving house, marrying, whistling, and going out or taking pictures after dark.

===Vietnam===


This festival is known as &quot;Tết Trung Nguyên&quot; and is viewed as a time for the pardoning of condemned souls who are released from hell. The &quot;homeless&quot; should be &quot;fed&quot; and appeased with offerings of food. Merits for the living are also earned by the release of birds and fish. The lunar month in which the festival takes place is colloquially known as &quot;Tháng Cô Hồn&quot; - the month of lonely spirits, and believed to be haunted and particularly unlucky.

Influenced by Buddhism, this holiday coincides with &quot;Vu Lan&quot;, the Vietnamese transliteration for Ullambana.

In modern times, Vu Lan is also seen as Parents&#x27; Day. People with living parents would bear a red rose and would give thanks while those without can choose to bear a white rose; and attend services to pray for the deceased.

===Related Buddhist traditions in other parts of Asia===
In Asian Theravadin Buddhist countries, related traditions, ceremonies, and festivals also occur. Like its &quot;Ullambana Sutra&quot;-origins in Mahayana Buddhist countries, the Theravada scripture, the &quot;Petavatthu&quot; gave rise to the idea of offering food to the hungry ghosts in the Theravada tradition as a form of merit-making. In stories published in the &quot;Petavatthu&quot; Maudgalyayana, who also plays the central role in the rise of the concept in the Mahayana tradition, along with Sariputta also play a role in the rise of the concept in the Theravada tradition. Similarly to the rise of the concept in Mahayana Buddhism, a version of &quot;Maudgalyayana Rescues His Mother&quot;, where Maudgalyayana is replaced by Sariputta is recorded in the &quot;Petavatthu&quot; and is in part the basis behind the practice of the concept in Theravadin societies. The concept of offering food to the hungry ghosts is also found in early Buddhist literature, in the &quot;Tirokudda Kanda&quot;.

====Cambodia====
In Cambodia, a fifteen-day-long annual festival known as &quot;Pchum Ben&quot; occurs generally in September or October. Cambodians pay their respects to deceased relatives up to seven generations. The gates of hell are believed to open during this period and many people make offerings to these hungry ghosts.

====Laos====
In Laos, a festival known as, &quot;Boun khao padap din&quot; usually occurs in September each year and goes on for two weeks. During this period, it is believed that hungry ghosts are freed from hell and enter the world of the living. A second festival known as &quot;Boun khao salak&quot; occurs directly after the conclusion of &quot;Boun khay padab din&quot;. During this period, food offerings are made to the hungry ghosts.

====Sri Lanka====

In Sri Lanka, food offerings are made to Buddhist monks as a way for indirectly offering them to their relatives who might have been born as a hungry ghost. This is typically offered on the seventh day, three months and one year after the death day of a deceased person. It is a ceremony conducted after death as part of traditional Sri Lankan Buddhist funeral rites and is known as &quot;mataka dānēs&quot; or &quot;matakadānaya&quot;. The offerings that are made acquire merit which are then transformed back into the equivalent goods in the world of the hungry ghosts. The offering that is offered on the seventh day, comes a day after personalized food offerings are given in the garden to the spirit of the deceased relative, which occurs on the sixth day. The deceased who do not reach the proper afterworld, the Hungry Ghost realm, are feared by the living as they are believed to cause various sicknesses and disasters to the living. Buddhist monks are called upon to perform &quot;pirit&quot; to ward off the floating spirits. The rite is also practiced in Thailand and Myanmar and is also practiced during the Ghost Festival that is observed in other Asian countries.

====Thailand====
In Thailand, a fifteen-day-long annual festival known as &quot;Sat Thai&quot; is celebrated between September and October in Thailand especially in southern Thailand, particularly in the province of Nakhon Si Thammarat. Like related festivals and traditions in other parts of Asia, the deceased are believed to come back to earth for fifteen days and people make offerings to them. The festival is known as &quot;Sat Thai&quot; to differentiate it from the Chinese Ghost Festival which is known as &quot;Sat Chin&quot; in the Thai language.

==== Japan ====

===== &quot;Chūgen&quot; =====
&quot;Chūgen&quot; (中元), also , is an annual event in Japan on the 15th day of the 7th month, when people give gifts, especially to their superiors. Originally it was an annual event for giving gifts to the ancestral spirits.

One of the three days that form the of Daoism, it is sometimes considered a &quot;zassetsu&quot;, a type of seasonal day in the Japanese calendar.

===== &quot;Bon&quot; =====

&quot;Obon&quot; (sometimes transliterated &quot;O-bon&quot;), or simply &quot;Bon&quot;, is the Japanese version of the Ghost Festival. It has since been transformed over time into a family reunion holiday during which people from the big cities return to their home towns and visit and clean the resting places of their ancestors.

Traditionally including a dance called Bon Odori, Obon has existed in Japan for more than 500 years. In modern Japan, it is held on July 15 in the eastern part (Kantō) and on August 15 in the western part (Kansai). In Okinawa and the Amami Islands, it is celebrated as in China, on the 15th day of the 7th lunar month. In 2019, Obon was held on the same date in Kansai, Okinawa, and the Amami Islands, as August 15 on that year, was also the 15th day of the 7th lunar month.

===Related Hindu traditions in other parts of Asia===
====India====
The performance of Shraddha by a son during Pitru Paksha is regarded as compulsory by Hindus, to ensure that the soul of the ancestor goes to heaven. In this context, the scripture Garuda Purana says, &quot;there is no salvation for a man without a son&quot;. The scriptures preach that a householder should propitiate ancestors (Pitris), along with the gods (devas), ghosts (bhutas), and guests. The scripture Markandeya Purana says that if the ancestors are content with the shraddhas, they will bestow health, wealth, knowledge and longevity, and ultimately heaven and salvation (moksha) upon the performer.

====Indonesia====
In Bali and some parts of Indonesia, particularly among the indigenous Hindus of Indonesia, ancestors who have died and cremated are said to return to visit their former homes. This day is known as Hari Raya Galungan and celebrations typically last over two weeks, often in the form of specific food and religious offerings along with festivities. The festival date is often calculated according to the Balinese pawukon calendar and typically occurs every 210 days.

<text>Dusk... and Her Embrace is the second studio album by English extreme metal band Cradle of Filth. It was released on 28 August 1996. and is their first release on the label Music for Nations.

== Background ==
Much of the material for the album was written while the band were still under Cacophonous Records&#x27; contract. Speaking to Ryan Bird of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in 2008, Dani Filth remembered:

Filth later told &quot;Kerrang!&quot; that the tone and content of the record was also partly the result of Cradle&#x27;s isolation from the European black metal scene:

The album climaxes with a guest speech from Venom&#x27;s Cronos on the final track, &quot;Haunted Shores&quot;.

== Release ==

&quot;Dusk and Her Embrace&quot; was released on 28 August 1996 by record label Music for Nations. It charted just outside of the UK top 100, at 107.

== Critical reception ==
Critical reception of this album has been generally positive. AllMusic wrote: &quot;&quot;Dusk and Her Embrace&quot; may be [Cradle of Filth&#x27;s] finest moment.&quot; In 2021, it was elected by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; as the 4th best symphonic metal album of all time.

==&quot;Dusk and Her Embrace: The Original Sin&quot;==
&quot;Dusk... and Her Embrace&quot; exists in two versions. It was initially recorded as the band&#x27;s second album for Cacophonous records following &quot;The Principle of Evil Made Flesh&quot;. Cradle&#x27;s relationship with Cacophonous subsequently collapsed, however, with the band accusing the label of contractual and financial mismanagement. Acrimonious legal proceedings took up most of 1995, and the original version of &quot;Dusk&quot; was shelved and later re-worked and re-recorded as the eventual 1996 Music for Nations release. Writing in &quot;The Gospel of Filth&quot; in 2009, Dani indicated that these early recordings were merely demos, rather than a finished album:

Dani Filth revealed plans for a 20th anniversary release of the original 1995 Cacophonous recordings in 2015, and a release date was officially announced in 2016. Filth told &quot;Team Rock&quot;:
The title for the new release was &quot;Dusk... and Her Embrace: The Original Sin&quot;. It was released on CD and digital on 8 July 2016. A vinyl version, limited to 666 copies, followed on 10 October 2016. The liner notes confirm that the lineup for this version was almost the same as for &quot;The Principle of Evil Made Flesh&quot;, including Paul Allender, Paul Ryan and Benjamin Ryan, but excluding Robin Graves, who was shortly replaced by Jon Kennedy. Allender, the Ryan brothers and Kennedy all left the band before the 1996 version of &quot;Dusk...&quot; was recorded.

<text>The Wrangell Mountains are a high mountain range of eastern Alaska in the United States. Much of the range is included in Wrangell-Saint Elias National Park and Preserve. The Wrangell Mountains are almost entirely volcanic in origin, and they include the second and third highest volcanoes in the United States, Mount Blackburn and Mount Sanford. The range takes its name from Mount Wrangell, which is one of the largest andesite shield volcanoes in the world, and also the only presently active volcano in the range. The Wrangell Mountains comprise most of the Wrangell Volcanic Field, which also extends into the neighboring Saint Elias Mountains and the Yukon Territory in Canada.

The Wrangell Mountains are just to the northwest of the Saint Elias Mountains and northeast of the Chugach Mountains, which are along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska. These ranges have the combined effect of blocking the inland areas from warmer moist air over the Pacific Ocean. The inland areas to the north of the Wrangell Mountains are therefore among the coldest areas of North America during the winter.

==Major peaks==
The Wrangell Mountains include 12 of the 40+ Alaskan peaks over (see fourteeners and thirteeners):

*Mount Blackburn, , and East Summit, 
*Mount Sanford, , and South Peak, 
*Mount Wrangell, , and West Summit, 
*Atna Peaks, 
*Regal Mountain, 
*Mount Jarvis, , and North Peak, 
*Parka Peak, 
*Mount Zanetti, 

Other prominent mountains include:
*Mount Drum, 
*Castle Peak, 

==Name origin and references in popular culture==
The mountains are named after explorer, president of Russian-American Company, and admiral Ferdinand von Wrangel. American folk singer John Denver wrote a song, &quot;The Wrangell Mountain Song&quot;, in reference to the range.

<text>Magic Eye is a series of books that feature autostereograms.

After creating its first images in 1991, creator Tom Baccei worked with Tenyo, a Japanese company that sells magic supplies. Tenyo published its first book in late 1991 titled &quot;Miru Miru Mega Yokunaru Magic Eye&quot; (&quot;Your Eyesight Gets Better &amp; Better in a Very Short Rate of Time: Magic Eye&quot;), sending sales representatives out to street corners to demonstrate how to see the hidden image. Within a few weeks the first Japanese book became a best seller, as did the second, rushed out shortly after.

The first North American &quot;Magic Eye&quot; book was &quot;Magic Eye: A New Way of Looking at the World&quot;.

&quot;Magic Eye&quot; stereograms have been used by orthoptists and vision therapists in the treatment of some binocular vision and accommodative disorders.

<doc id="464509" wikidata="Q6139846" url="?curid=464509" title="USS Suwannee (CVE-27)">
<text>USS &quot;Suwannee&quot; (CVE-27), was built as the civilian oiler &quot;Markay&quot;, in 1939, before being acquired by the US Navy, in 1941, and renamed &quot;Suwannee&quot; (AO-33), after the tradition of naming fleet oilers after rivers. In 1942, she was converted to a . Originally classified as an &quot;Aircraft Escort Vessel&quot;, AVG-27, on 14 February 1942, she was reclassified an &quot;Auxiliary Aircraft Carrier&quot;, ACV-27, 20 August 1942, before finally being classified as an &quot;Escort Carrier&quot;, CVE-27, 15 July 1943. After the war, she was later classified an &quot;Escort Helicopter Aircraft Carrier&quot; and again redesignated, CVHE-27, 12 June 1955.

==Construction==
&quot;Markay&quot; was laid down on 3 June 1938, at Kearney, New Jersey, by the Federal Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., under a Maritime Commission contract (MC Hull 5); launched on 4 March 1939; sponsored by Mrs. Marguerite Vickery (née Blanchard), wife of Howard L. Vickery; delivered to the Keystone Tankship Corporation, and operated by that company until acquired by the Navy, on 26 June 1941. Keystone Tankship Corp., in turn delivered the vessel at Baltimore, Maryland. Renamed &quot;Suwannee&quot; (AO-33), the ship was commissioned &quot;in ordinary&quot;, an inactive status, on 9 July 1941, then placed in commission, on 16 July 1941.

==World War II==
After operating for six months as an oiler with the Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Suwannee&quot; was designated an &quot;Aircraft Escort Vessel&quot;, AVG-27, on 14 February 1942, and decommissioned, on 21 February, at Newport News, Virginia, for conversion to a . On 20 August, she was redesignated an &quot;Auxiliary Carrier&quot;, ACV-27, and was recommissioned as such on 24 September 1942, Captain Joseph J. Clark in command.

===1942===
Less than a month after commissioning, &quot;Suwannee&quot; was underway from Hampton Roads, for the invasion of North Africa. She joined as the other carrier attached to the Center Attack Group whose specific objective was Casablanca, itself, via Fedhala, just to the north. Early in the morning of 8 November, she arrived off the coast of Morocco, and for the next few days, her Grumman F4F Wildcats maintained combat and anti-submarine (ASW) air patrols, while her Grumman TBF Avengers joined &quot;Ranger&quot;″s in bombing missions. During the Naval Battle of Casablanca from 8–11 November, &quot;Suwannee&quot; sent up 255 air sorties and lost only five planes, three in combat and two to operational problems.

On 11 November, off Fedhala Roads, her ASW patrol sank what was reported to be a German U-boat, but which was later determined to have been , one of the three French submarines which sortied from Casablanca, on the day of the assault. She was the first escort carrier to score against an enemy submarine, and she helped to prove the usefulness of her type in ASW.

&quot;Suwannee&quot; remained in North African waters until mid-November, then sailed, via Bermuda, for Norfolk, Virginia. She arrived back at Hampton Roads, on 24 November, and stayed until 5 December, when she got underway for the South Pacific.

===1943===
The auxiliary carrier transited the Panama Canal, on 11–12 December, and arrived at New Caledonia, on 4 January 1943. For the next seven months, she provided air escort for transports and supply ships replenishing and bolstering the Marines on Guadalcanal, as well as for the forces occupying other islands in the Solomons group. During that span of time, she visited Guadalcanal, Efate, and Espiritu Santo in addition to New Caledonia. She was reclassified as an &quot;Escort Carrier&quot;, CVE-27, on 15 July 1943.

She returned to the United States at San Diego, California, in October, and by 5 November, was back at Espiritu Santo. On 13 November, she departed to participate in the Gilbert Islands operation. From 19–23 November, she was a part of the Air Support Group of the Southern Attack Force, and her planes bombed Tarawa, while the ships in the Northern Attack Force engaged the enemy at Makin. Following the occupation of the Gilberts, the escort carrier returned to the US, via Pearl Harbor, arriving in San Diego on 21 December.

===1944===
She remained on the west coast for two weeks, into the new year, then set a course for Lahaina Roads in the Hawaiian Islands. She departed Hawaii, on 22 January 1944, and headed for the Marshalls. During that operation, &quot;Suwannee&quot; joined the Northern Attack Force, and her planes bombed and strafed Roi and Namur Islands, in the northern part of Kwajalein Atoll, and conducted anti-submarine patrols for the task force. She remained in the vicinity of Kwajalein for the first 15 days of February, then spent the next nine days helping out at Eniwetok. On 24 February, she headed east again and arrived at Pearl Harbor, on 2 March for a two-week stay.

By 30 March, she was in the vicinity of the Palau Islands as the 5th Fleet subjected those islands to two days of extensive bombing raids. A week later, she put into Espiritu Santo, for four days. After short stops at Purvis Bay, in the Solomons, and at Seeadler Harbor, Manus, the escort carrier headed for New Guinea. For two weeks, she supported the Hollandia landings by shuttling replacement aircraft to the larger fleet carriers actually engaged in air support of the landings. She returned to Manus on 5 May.

Following two voyages from Espiritu Santo, one to Tulagi and the other to Kwajalein, &quot;Suwannee&quot; arrived off Saipan, in mid-June. For the next one and a half months, she supported the invasion of the Marianas, participating in the campaigns against Saipan and Guam. On 19 June, as the Battle of the Philippine Sea began to unfold, &quot;Suwannee&quot; was one of the first ships to draw enemy blood when one of her planes flying combat air patrol attacked and sank the . &quot;Suwanee&quot;″s planes did not actually become engaged in the famous battle of naval aircraft, because they remained with the invasion forces in the Marianas providing ASW and combat air patrols (CAPs).

On 4 August, she cleared the Marianas for Eniwetok and Seeadler Harbor, reaching the latter port on 13 August. Almost a month later, on 10 September, she put to sea to support the landings on Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies. Those landings went off without opposition on 15 September, and &quot;Suwannee&quot; returned to Seeadler Harbor, to prepare for the invasion of the Philippines.

On 12 October, the escort carrier got underway from Manus, in Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague&#x27;s Escort Carrier Group to provide air support for the landings at Leyte Gulf. She reached the Philippines several days later, and her planes began strikes on enemy installations in the Visayas until 25 October. She provided air support for the assault forces with ASW and CAPs and strikes against Japanese installations ashore.

On 24–25 October 1944, the Japanese launched a major surface offensive from three directions to contest the landings at Leyte Gulf. While Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa&#x27;s Mobile Force sailed south from Japan and drew the bulk of Admiral William Halsey&#x27;s 3d Fleet off to the north, Admiral Shima&#x27;s 2nd Striking Force, along with Admiral Shoji Nishimura&#x27;s Force, attempted to force the Surigao Strait from the south. This drew Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf&#x27;s Bombardment Group south to meet that threat in the Battle of Surigao Strait. With Admiral Oldendorf&#x27;s old battleships fighting in Surigao Strait and Halsey&#x27;s 3rd Fleet scurrying north, &quot;Suwannee&quot;, with the other 15 escort carriers and 22 destroyers and destroyer escorts, formed the only Allied naval force operating off Leyte Gulf when Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s 1st Striking Force sneaked through the unguarded San Bernardino Strait into the Philippine Sea.

Just before 07:00, on 25 October, one of ″s planes reported a Japanese force of four battleships, eight cruisers, and 11 destroyers. This force, Kurita&#x27;s, immediately began a surface engagement with Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague&#x27;s &quot;Taffy 3&quot;, the northernmost group of escort carriers. &quot;Suwannee&quot; was much farther south as an element of Rear Admiral Thomas Sprague&#x27;s &quot;Taffy 1&quot;. Consequently, she did not participate in the running surface Battle off Samar.
Her problems came from another quarter. At 07:40, on 25 October, &quot;Taffy 1&quot; was jumped by land-based planes from Davao in the first deliberate &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack of the war. The first one crashed into ; and, 30 seconds later, &quot;Suwannee&quot; splashed a &quot;kamikaze&quot; during his run on . Her gunners soon shot down another enemy plane, then bore down on a third circling in the clouds at about . They hit the enemy, but he rolled over, dove at &quot;Suwannee&quot; and crashed into her at 08:04 about forward of the after elevator, opening a hole in her flight deck. His bomb compounded the fracture when it exploded between the flight and hangar decks, tearing a gash in the latter and causing a number of casualties.

Medical officer Lieutenant Walter B. Burwell wrote:

One of our corpsmen tending the wounded on the flight deck saw the plight of those isolated by fire on the forecastle. He came below to report that medical help was critically needed there. It seemed to me that we would have to try to get through to them. So he and I restocked our first aid bags with morphine syrettes, tourniquets, sulfa, Vaseline, and bandages, commandeered a fire extinguisher and made our way forward, dodging flames along the main deck. Along part of the way, we were joined by a sailor manning a seawater fire hose with fairly good pressure, and though the seawater would only scatter the gasoline fires away from us, by using the water and foam alternatively as we advanced, we managed to work our way up several decks, through passageways along the wrecked and burning combat information center and decoding area, through officers&#x27; country, and finally out on the forecastle. Many of the crew on the forecastle and the catwalks above it had been blown over the side by the explosions. But others trapped below and aft of the forecastle area found themselves under a curtain of fire from aviation gasoline pouring down from burning planes on the flight deck above. Their only escape was to leap aflame into the sea, but some were trapped so that they were incinerated before they could leap. By the time we arrived on the forecastle, the flow of gasoline had mostly consumed itself, and flames were only erupting and flickering from combustible areas of water and oil. Nonetheless, the decks and bulkheads were still blistering hot and ammunition in the small arms locker on the deck below was popping from the heat like strings of firecrackers. With each salvo of popping, two or three more panicky crew men would leap over the side, and we found that our most urgent task was to persuade those poised on the rail not to jump by a combination of physical restraint and reassurance that fires were being controlled and that more help was on the way. Most of the remaining wounded in the forecastle area were severely burned beyond recognition and hope.

Within two hours, her flight deck was sufficiently repaired to enable the escort carrier to resume air operations. &quot;Suwanee&quot;″s group fought off two more air attacks before 13:00; then steamed in a northeasterly direction to join Taffy 3 and launch futile searches for Kurita&#x27;s rapidly retiring force. Just after noon on 26 October, another group of &quot;kamikaze&quot;s jumped Taffy 1. A Zero crashed into &quot;Suwanee&quot;″s flight deck at 1240 and careened into a torpedo bomber which had just been recovered. The two planes erupted upon contact as did nine other planes on her flight deck. The resulting fire burned for several hours, but was finally brought under control. The casualties for 25–26 October were 107 dead and 160 wounded. The escort carriers put into Kossol Roads, in the Palaus, on 28 October, then headed for Manus, for upkeep, on 1 November.

===1945===
After five days in Seeadler Harbor, &quot;Suwannee&quot; got underway to return to the west coast for major repairs. She stopped at Pearl Harbor, overnight on 19–20 November, and arrived at Puget Sound Navy Yard, on 26 November. Her repairs were completed by 31 January 1945; and, after brief stops at Hunter&#x27;s Point and Alameda, California, she headed west and back into the war. The escort carrier stopped at Pearl Harbor, from 16–23 February, at Tulagi, from 4–14 March, and at Ulithi, from 21–27 March, before arriving off Okinawa, on 1 April.

Her first assignment was close air support for the invasion troops, but, within a few days, she settled down to a routine of pounding the &quot;kamikaze&quot; bases at Sakishima Gunto. For the major portion of the next 77 days, her planes continued to deny the enemy the use of those air bases. Periodically, she put into the anchorage at Kerama Retto, to rearm and replenish, but she spent the bulk of her time in air operations at sea.

On 16 June, she headed for San Pedro Bay, in Leyte Gulf. She remained there for a week, then returned to the Netherlands East Indies, at Makassar Strait, to support the landings at Balikpapan, Borneo. The carrier reentered San Pedro Bay, on 6 July, and spent the next month there. On 3 August, she got underway for Okinawa, arriving in Buckner Bay, three days later.

Hostilities ended on 15 August, but &quot;Suwannee&quot; remained at Okinawa, for the next three weeks. On 7 September, stood out of Buckner Bay, in company with , , , and , as screen for the carriers &quot;Suwannee&quot;, , , and the cruiser , bound for Japan and occupation duty in the erstwhile enemy&#x27;s waters. For the week that followed, the group operated off the coast of Kyushu, southwest of Nagasaki, Japan, while aircraft from the carriers patrolled the island and coast and assisted in locating mines in the clearance operations paving the way for entry into the harbor at Nagasaki. The ships had entered Nagasaki Harbor by 15 September while Allied prisoners of war (New Zealand) were taken on board the hospital ship . The carriers were sent there because of their medical facilities and doctors. &quot;Chenango&quot; left Nagasaki, on the morning of 15 September, with war prisoners. Crew members of &quot;Suwannee&quot; were given shore leave during their stay and observed the devastation of ground zero first hand. &quot;Suwannee&quot; and all the other ships in port experienced very difficult circumstances when typhoon Ida hit on 17 September. While moored between two buoys with two steel cables and an hawser both bow and stern, she lost all contact with the stern buoy and moved dangerously close to shore. The bow cables and hawser held and she remained safely in place by turning the screws to maintain position.

On 21 September, &quot;Suwannee&quot; departed Nagasaki, and remained at sea until she made a quick seven-hour stop at the outer harbor of Nagasaki before heading toward Kobe. That stop was aborted because of a minefield on the path there, so they returned south to Wakayama on 27 September. On 2 October, &quot;Suwannee&quot; Captain Charles C. McDonald and Rear Admiral William Sample, who headed COMCARDIV 22 on board &quot;Suwannee&quot;, took off in a Martin PBM Mariner to maintain their flight qualifications and never returned. They were declared dead on 4 October of the following year. They and the seven members of the flight crew were discovered in the wreckage of the aircraft on 19 November 1948, and their bodies were recovered.

During this time &quot;Suwannee&quot; was transferred from the US 9th Fleet to the 5th Fleet. They remained at Wakayama, until the morning of 4 October, and ran into tropical storm Kate. They then spent a few days in the port of Kure, just south of Hiroshima, and then they returned near Wakayama, on 10 October, for &quot;typhoon anchorage&quot; as another storm, typhoon Louise, was approaching. They once again anchored in Wakayama, on 13 October, for about two days and then headed north to Tokyo, arriving on the evening of 18 October. About this time &quot;Suwannee&quot; received orders detaching them from the fleet and assigned them to Operation Magic Carpet.

The ship reached Saipan around 15:00, on 28 October, and stayed just long enough, 15 hours, to load stores and 400 troops. Then on to Guam, arriving at 17:00, on 29 October, to load approximately 35 planes, for a total complement of around 70 planes, then on to Pearl Harbor. For their November participation in Operation Magic Carpet they were part of a much larger contingency of ships. In the Pacific, all the 1,430,000 Navy, Coast Guard, and Marine personnel and the 1,360,000 Army people, on 1 November, except those in occupation units are scheduled to be returned by June. Engaged in the Pacific operations as of 10 November, were 489 ships having space for slightly under 700,000 passengers. Included were: 6 battleships, 7 large carriers, 4 &quot;Independence&quot;-class carriers, 45 escort carriers, 21 light cruisers, 164 troopships, 165 assault transports, 30 hospital transports, 7 converted Liberty ships and 40 miscellaneous craft.
After a stop in Hawaii, &quot;Suwannee&quot; was sent to Long Beach, and had a short dry-dock period. Then it was back to Operation Magic Carpet, on 4 December. This trip was to be a non-stop return to Okinawa, to pick up 1,500 troops on an overnight stop, and then return to Seattle. Because of bad weather they did not arrive in Okinawa until 21 December. In mid-January &quot;Suwannee&quot; unloaded many grateful troops in Los Angeles, and then headed north. After a few days off San Francisco, she headed for Pier 91, in Seattle, and then on to Bremerton. On 28 October, the carrier was placed in a reserve status with the 16th Fleet, at Boston, and just over two months later, on 8 January 1947, she was placed out of commission.

&quot;Suwannee&quot; remained in reserve at Boston, for the next 12 years. She was designated an &quot;Escort Helicopter Aircraft Carrier&quot;, CVHE-27, on 12 June 1955, while in reserve. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 March 1959. Her hulk was sold to the Isbrantsen Steamship Company, of New York City, on 30 November 1959, for conversion to merchant service. The project was subsequently canceled and in May 1961, her hulk was resold to the J.C. Berkwit Company, also of New York City. She was finally scrapped in Bilbao, Spain, in June 1962.

==Awards==
&quot;Suwannee&quot; earned 13 battle stars during World War II.

<text>A Master of Laws (M.L. or LL.M.; Latin: &#x27; or&#x27;) is an postgraduate academic degree, pursued by those either holding an undergraduate academic law degree, a professional law degree, or an undergraduate degree in a related subject. In many jurisdictions, the LL.M. is an advanced professional degree for those usually already admitted into legal practice.

==Definition==
To become a lawyer and practice law in most states and countries, a person must first obtain a law degree. In most common law countries, a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) is required. In the United States, the Juris Doctor (J.D.) is generally a requirement to practice law. Some jurisdictions, such as Canada and Australia, require either an LL.B. or J.D. Individuals with law degrees must typically pass an additional set of examinations to qualify as a lawyer.

The LL.M. program is a postgraduate program, typically for individuals who either possess a law degree or have qualified as a lawyer. The word &quot;legum&quot; is the genitive plural form of the Latin word &quot;lex&quot; and means &quot;of the laws&quot;. When used in the plural, it signifies a specific body of laws, as opposed to the general collective concept embodied in the word &quot;jus&quot;, from which the words &quot;juris&quot; and &quot;justice&quot; derive.

An LL.M. is also typically a requirement for entry into the research doctoral programs in law, such as the Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D or J.S.D.), the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D. or DPhil) or doctorat en droit (in France), Doktor der Rechtswissenschaften (Dr. iur.) (in Germany), the Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.), and the Doctor of Laws (LL.D.).

Historically, the LL.M. degree is an element particular to the education system of English speaking countries, which is based on a distinction between bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. Over the past years, however, specialized LL.M. programs have been introduced in many European countries.

==Types of LL.M. degrees==

A wide range of LL.M. programs are available worldwide, allowing students to focus on almost any area of the law. Most universities offer only a small number of LL.M. programs. One of the most popular LL.M. degrees in the United States is in tax law, sometimes referred to as an MLT (Master of Laws in Taxation).

In Europe, LL.M. programs in European law are popular, often referred to as LL.M. Eur (Master of European Law).

In the Netherlands and its former colonies, the title used was Meester in de Rechten (mr.). This title is still widely used in the Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium), especially by those who studied Dutch or Belgian law respectively.

Some LL.M. programs, particularly in the United States, and also in China, focus on teaching foreign lawyers the basic legal principles of the host country.

The length of time to study an LL.M. program depends on the mode of study. Most full-time on-campus courses take one academic year to complete. Other students may complete their LL.M. program on a part-time basis over two years, and courses are increasingly available online. Part-time online courses can take between two and five years to complete.

==Requirements==

LL.M. programs are usually only open to those students who have first obtained a degree in law, typically an LL.B. or J.D. Some programs are exceptions to this, requiring only an undergraduate degree or extensive experience in a related field. Full-time LL.M. programs usually last one year and vary in their graduation requirements. Most programs require or allow students to write a thesis. Some programs are research oriented with little classroom time, while others require students to take a set number of classes.

LL.M. degrees are often earned by students wishing to develop more concentrated expertise in a particular area of law. Pursuing an LL.M. degree may also allow law students to build a professional network. Some associations provide LL.M. degree holders with structures designed to strengthen their connections among peers and to access a competitive business environment, much like an MBA degree.

==LL.M. programs by country==

===Australia===
In Australia, the LL.M. is generally only open to law graduates. However, some universities permit non-law graduates to undertake variants of the degree. There are nearly 100 LLM courses in Australia across 25 institutions taught in English.

Unique variants of the LL.M. exist, such as the Master of Legal Practice (M.L.P.) available at the Australian National University, where students who have completed the Graduate Diploma of Legal Practice (which law graduates must obtain before being able to be admitted as a solicitor/barrister), will be granted some credit towards the Master qualification. Other variants of the LL.M. are more similar to the LL.M. available in the wider Commonwealth but under a different title, for example Master of Commercial Law, Master of International Law or Master of Human Rights Law. These courses are usually more specialised than a standard LL.M.

===Canada===

In Canada, the LL.M. is generally open to law graduates holding an LL.B., LL.L., B.C.L., or a J.D. as a first degree. Students can choose to take research-based LL.M. degrees or course-based LL.M. degrees. Research-based LL.M. degrees are one- or two-year programs that require students to write a thesis that makes a significant contribution to their field of research. Course-based LL.M. degrees do not require a significant research paper. An LL.M. can be studied part-time, and at some schools, through distance learning. LL.M. degrees can be general, or students can choose to pursue a specialized area of research.

Foreign trained lawyers who wish to practice in Canada will first need to have their education and experience assessed by the Federation of Law Societies of Canada&#x27;s National Committee on Accreditation. Upon having received a certificate of accreditation from the National Committee on Accreditation, foreign law graduates would then have to obtain articles with a law firm, take the professional legal training course, and pass the professional exams to be called to the bar in a province. The University of British Columbia&#x27;s LLM in Common Law is an example of one of a few LLM courses that help to prepare students for the professional exams.

===China (Mainland)===

The LL.M. is available at China University of Political Science and Law, and the entrance requirements are: native English competency, or near native English, with any bachelor&#x27;s degree. The program is flexible and allows students to study Mandarin and assists with organizing work experience in Beijing and other cities in China. It normally takes two years, but can be completed in one and a half years if students take the required credits in time.

The flagship of the China-EU School of Law (CESL) in Beijing is a Double Master Programme including a Master of Chinese Law and a Master of European and International Law. The Master of European and International Law is taught in English, open for international students and can be studied as a single master programme. CESL also offers an International Master of Chinese Law (IMCL) which is an LL.M. in Chinese law taught entirely in English.

Beijing Foreign Studies University has launched an online LLM for international professionals. The course is taken over two years, with the first covering online lessons through video and assignments, the second year is for the dissertation and an online defense is required at the end. Students are required to attend Beijing for an introductory week in September to enroll and meet students and staff. Students also have the opportunity to take work experience at a top five law firm in China.

LL.M degree programs are available at many other universities in Mainland China, such as at Peking University, Tsinghua University, Shanghai Jiaotong University, and Shanghai International Studies University.

===Finland===
In Finland, an LL.M. is the standard graduate degree required to practice law. No other qualifications are required.

===France===

In France, the LL.M. is in English. The LL.M. in International Business Law is available at Panthéon-Assas University (Paris), the oldest school of law in France.

The entrance requirements are:

* Very good English level, with master&#x27;s degree in law (or equivalent); or
* Alternative diploma and four years&#x27; professional experience.

The course is flexible and allows students to study French.

A further 11 institutions in France offer almost 20 other LLM programs taught in English, with specialisms including European Law.

===Germany===

In Germany, the LL.M. is seen as an advanced legal qualification of supplementary character. Some graduates choose to undertake their LL.M. directly following their &quot;Erstes Juristisches Staatsexamen&quot; (the &quot;first state examination&quot;, which constitutes the first stage of the official German legal training), an alternative postgraduate course, or their &quot;Zweites Juristisches Staatsexamen&quot; (that is, the second and final stage of the official German legal training).

LL.M. degree programmes are offered by the law faculties of The University of Hong Kong, The Chinese University of Hong Kong and the City University of Hong Kong. An LL.B. degree is usually required for admission, but for some specialised programmes, such as the LL.M. in Human Rights programme offered by HKU, require an undergraduate degree in laws or any related discipline.

===India===
Similar to the United Kingdom, a master&#x27;s degree in law in India is basically opted to specialize in particular areas of law. Traditionally the most popular areas of specialization in these master&#x27;s degrees in law in India have been constitutional law, family law and taxation law.

With the establishment of the specialized autonomous law schools in India in 1987 (the first was the National Law School of India University) much emphasis is being given at the master&#x27;s level of legal education in India. With the establishment of these universities, focus in specialization has been shifted to newer areas such as corporate law, intellectual property law, international trade law etc. LL.M programs in India were previously two years in duration but presently typically last one year.

===Ireland===
A number of universities and colleges in Ireland offer LL.M. programs, such as Dublin City University, Trinity College Dublin, University College Cork, National University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG), National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM), the Law Society of Ireland in partnership with Northumbria University, and Griffith College.

University College Dublin also offers the Masters in Common Law (MCL/ &quot;Magisterii in Jure Communi, M.Jur.Com)&quot;, an advanced two-year programme for non-law graduates. The degree is a qualifying law degree for admittance to the entrance exams of the Honorable Society of King&#x27;s Inns.

===Italy===
Italy offers both master programs in Italian and in English, depending on the school. They are often called &quot;laurea specialistica&quot;, that is, the second step of the Bologna plan (European curriculum), and in this case they last two years. For example, the University of Milan offers a 2 years LLM on Sustainable Development. In South Tyrol programmes are also taught in German, as in Bolzano.

In Italy the term &quot;master&quot; often refers to a vocational master, 6 or 12 months long, on specific areas, such as &quot;law and internet security&quot;, or &quot;law of administrative management&quot;, is often taught part-time to allow professionals already working in the field to improve their skills.

===Mauritius===

The LLM in International Business Law from Panthéon-Assas University is also available in Mauritius in Medine Village campus.

===Netherlands===
To be allowed to practice law in the Netherlands, one needs an LL.M. degree with a specific set of courses in litigation law. The Dutch Order of Lawyers (NOVA) require these courses for every potential candidate lawyer who wants to be conditionally written in the district court for three years. After receiving all the diplomas prescribed by NOVA and under supervision of a &quot;patron&quot;, a lawyer is eligible to have his own practice and is unconditionally written in a court for life.

===Norway===
The Norwegian legal degrees master i rettsvitenskap (English for master in jurisprudence) are officially translated to English as Master of Laws (LL.M.), as these degrees are more comprehensive than the basic graduate law degree in common law countries (e.g., J.D. and LL.B). The last year in the five-year professional Norwegian law degree program is thus considered to correspond to a LL.M specialization. In addition, the universities with legal faculties at the masters level offers several LL.M programmes. For example, Universitetet i Oslo offers tuition-free LL.M courses in Public International Law, Maritime Law, Information and Communication Technology (ICT Law), as well as distinct specializations in human rights.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, the University of the Punjab, University of Karachi, Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto University of Law, International Islamic University, Islamabad, Government College University, Faisalabad, University of Sargodha are LL.M. degree awarding institutions. Completing a LL.M. qualification in Pakistan consists of studying eight subjects in four semesters. This spans over a period of two years and also requires the student to write a thesis on a proposed topic. A student has to pass in each of the subject in order to qualify for LL.M. degree, and the passing mark is set at 60%. The program is taught in English.

Universities in Pakistan teach comparative constitutional law, comparative human rights law and comparative jurisprudence as mandatory subjects. The programs also include research methodology and four elective subjects, which may include company law, taxation law, intellectual property law and banking law.

===Portugal===
The Master of Laws programmes offered in Portugal are extremely varied but do not, for the most part, use the designation LL.M., being more commonly called &quot;Mestrado em Direito&quot; (Master&#x27;s Degree in Law), like the ones at Coimbra University&#x27;s Faculty of Law and Lusíada University of Porto. Although the classical &quot;Mestrado em Direito&quot; takes two years to finish and involves a dissertation, there are some shorter variants. A few &quot;Mestrados&quot; with an international theme have specifically adopted the LL.M designation: the LL.M in European and Transglobal Business Law at the School of Law of the University of Minho and the LL.M. Law in a European and Global Context and the Advanced LL.M. in International Business Law, both at the Católica Global School of Law, in Lisbon.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, the LL.M. is in English.
The LL.M. in International Business Law from Panthéon-Assas University is also available in Singapore in Insead campus.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the LL.M. is a postgraduate degree offered both as a course-based and research-based master&#x27;s degree. In the former case, the degree comprises advanced coursework in a specific area of law as well as limited related research, usually in the form of a short dissertation, while in the latter, the degree is entirely thesis based. The first type, typically, comprises &quot;practice-oriented&quot; topics (e.g. in tax, mining law), while the second type is theory-oriented, often preparing students for admission to LL.D. or Ph.D. programmes. Admission is generally limited to LL.B. graduates, although holders of other law degrees, such as the BProc, may be able to apply if admitted as attorneys and/or by completing supplementary LL.B. coursework.

===Sweden===

Masters degree (LL.M) is the standard graduate degree among law practitioners in Sweden. The masters programme takes four and half years to complete. At most universities, the last one and a half years are specialization at advanced level (advanced level courses and thesis). It is possible to get a bachelor&#x27;s degree after three years, but the vast majority of legal practitioners in Sweden have a LL.M.

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan, law can be studied as a postgraduate degree resulting in an LL.M. Some LL.M. programs in Taiwan are offered to students with or without a legal background. However, the graduation requirements for students with a legal background are lower than for those students who do not have a legal background (to account for fundamental legal subjects that were taken during undergraduate studies). Students studying in an LL.M. program normally take three years to earn the necessary credits and finish a master&#x27;s thesis.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, an LL.M. programme is open to those holding a recognised legal qualification, generally an undergraduate degree in Laws such as The LL.B. or The B.A. in Law; The Graduate Diploma in Law - (GDL), or a recognized equivalent. They do not have to be or intend to be legal practitioners. An LL.M. is not required, nor is it a sufficient qualification in itself to practise as a solicitor or barrister, since this requires completion of the Solicitor&#x27;s Qualifying Examination - (SQE), Legal Practice Course, Bar Professional Training Course, The CILEX Level 06 Diploma in Legal Practice or, if in Scotland, the Diploma in Legal Practice. As with other degrees, an LL.M. can be studied on a part-time basis at many institutions and in some circumstances by distance learning. Some providers of the Bar Professional Training Course and the Legal Practice Course also allow the student to gain an LL.M. qualification on top of these professional courses by writing a dissertation. 

The UK offers over 1000 different LL.Ms. Large law faculties such as Queen Mary University of London offer multiple different programs, whilst other such as Aston University simply offer one program. Some institutions allow those without a first degree in law onto their LL.M. programme. Examples of such programmes include the Master of Studies in Legal Research at Oxford, the LL.M. degrees at the University of Edinburgh and LL.M.s at the University of Leicester In addition, Queen&#x27;s University Belfast offers an LL.M. suite, accessible to legal and social science graduates, leading to specialisms in sustainable development, corporate governance, devolution or human rights. Northumbria University offers an approach to the LL.M. qualification by starting the master&#x27;s programme as undergraduates. Students completing this four-year programme graduate with a combined LL.M. and Legal Practice Course professional qualification or BPTC.

====Oxbridge====

The University of Cambridge has a taught postgraduate law course, which formerly conferred an LL.B. on successful candidates (undergraduates studying law at Cambridge received a B.A.). In 1982 the LL.B. for postgraduate students was replaced with a more conventional LL.M. to avoid confusion with undergraduate degrees in other universities. Additionally in 2012 the University of Cambridge introduced the M.C.L. (Masters of Corporate Law) aimed at postgraduate students with interests in corporate law.

The University of Oxford unconventionally names its taught masters of laws B.C.L. (Bachelor of Civil Law) and M.Jur. (Magister Juris), and its research masters either MPhil (Master of Philosophy) or MSt (Master of Studies). Oxford continues to name its principal postgraduate law degree the B.C.L. for largely historic reasons, as the B.C.L. is one of the oldest and most senior degrees, having been conferred since the sixteenth century. The M.Jur. was introduced in 1991. At present there is no LL.M. degree conferred by the university. Oxford claims that the B.C.L. is &quot;the most highly regarded taught masters-level qualification in the common law world&quot;. Additionally, the University of Oxford introduced the MSc in Law and Finance (MLF) and the MSc in Taxation in 2010 and 2016, respectively.

===United States===

In the United States, the acquisition of an LL.M. degree is often a way to specialize in an area of law such as tax law, business law, international business law, health law, trial advocacy, environmental law or intellectual property. A number of schools have combined J.D.-LL.M. programs, while others offer the degree through online study. Some LL.M. programs feature a general study of American law. Degree requirements vary by school, and they often differ for LL.M. students who previously earned a J.D. from an American law school and LL.M. students who previously earned a law degree from a non-American law school.

====Programs for foreign legal graduates====
An LL.M. degree from an ABA-approved law school also allows a foreign lawyer to become eligible to apply for admission to the bar in certain states. Each state has different rules relating to the admittance of foreign-educated lawyers to state bar associations.

An LL.M. degree from an ABA-approved law school qualifies a foreign legal graduate to take the bar exam in Alabama, California, New Hampshire, New York, Texas, as well as in the independent republic of Palau.

In addition, legal practice in the home jurisdiction plus a certain amount of coursework at an accredited law school qualifies a foreign legal graduate to take the bar exam in Alaska, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah and West Virginia. However, a number of states, including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, New Jersey and North Carolina only recognize J.D. degrees from accredited law schools as qualification to take the bar.

New York allows foreign lawyers from civil law countries to sit for the New York bar exam once they have completed a minimum of 24 credit hours (usually but not necessarily in an LL.M. program) at an ABA-approved law school involving at least two basic subjects tested on the New York bar exam, including 12 credits in specific areas of law. Lawyers from common-law countries face more lenient restrictions and may not need to study at an ABA-approved law school. Foreign lawyers from both civil law and common law jurisdictions, however, are required to demonstrate that they have successfully completed a course of law studies of at least three years that would fulfill the educational requirements to bar admission in their home country.

====International law and other LL.M. programs====
As of 2008, there is one LL.M. degree in International Law offered by The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, the oldest school of international affairs in the United States. Given that the degree specializes in international law, the program has not sought ABA accreditation.

The Notre Dame Law School at the University of Notre Dame offers an LL.M in International Human Rights Law to JD graduates from ABA-accredited US schools or LL.B or equivalent from accredited non-US schools.

Both Duke University School of Law and Cornell Law School offer J.D. students the opportunity to simultaneously pursue an LL.M. in International and Comparative Law.

The University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Law provides an LL.M. in Space, Cyber &amp; Telecommunications Law, the only program providing focused study in these three areas. The program was established using a grant from NASA and a partnership with the U.S. Air Force Strategic Command.

St. Mary&#x27;s University offers the LL.M. in International and Comparative Law, with students having the option to complete both it and their J.D. simultaneously.

The University of Tulsa College of Law offers an LL.M. in American Indian and Indigenous Peoples Law to JD graduates from ABA-accredited US schools or LL.B or equivalent from accredited non-US schools.

The University of Washington School of Law offers an LL.M. in Sustainable International Development, the first program of its kind to focus on international development law. LL.M. students in this program are also able to elect for a concentration in Indigenous Rights Law. Similarly, the school offers a separate LL.M. degree in Asian and Comparative Law.

There is one institution that offers an ABA-approved LL.M, that does not offer a J.D. degree: The U.S. Army Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Legal Center and School offers an officer&#x27;s resident graduate course, a specialized program beyond the first degree in law, leading to an LL.M. in Military Law.

<text>Jin Ping Mei ()—translated into English as The Plum in the Golden Vase or The Golden Lotus—is a Chinese novel of manners composed in vernacular Chinese during the latter half of the 16th century during the late Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Consisting of 100 chapters, it was published under the pseudonym Lanling Xiaoxiao Sheng (), &quot;The Scoffing Scholar of Lanling,&quot; but the only clue to the actual identity is that the author hailed from Lanling County in present-day Shandong. The novel circulated in manuscript as early as 1596, and may have undergone revision up to its first printed edition in 1610. The most widely read recension, edited and published with commentaries by Zhang Zhupo in 1695, deleted or rewrote passages to help understand the author&#x27;s intentions.

The explicit depiction of sexuality garnered the novel a notoriety akin to &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; and &quot;Lolita&quot; in the West, but critics such as the translator David Tod Roy see a firm moral structure which exacts retribution for the sexual libertinism of the central characters.

&quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot; takes its name from the three central female characters—Pan Jinlian (, whose given name means &quot;Golden Lotus&quot;); Li Ping&#x27;er (, literally &quot;Little Vase&quot;), a concubine of Ximen Qing; and Pang Chunmei (, &quot;Spring plum blossoms&quot;), a young maid who rose to power within the family. Chinese critics see each of the three Chinese characters in the title as symbolizing an aspect of human nature, such as &quot;mei&quot; (), plum blossoms, being metaphoric for sexuality.

David Tod Roy calls the novel &quot;a landmark in the development of the narrative art form—not only from a specifically Chinese perspective but in a world-historical context ... noted for its surprisingly modern technique&quot; and &quot;with the possible exception of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; ( 1010) and &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1605, 1615), there is no earlier work of prose fiction of equal sophistication in world literature.&quot; &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot; is considered one of the six classics of Chinese novels.

==Plot==

&quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot; is framed as a spin-off from &quot;Water Margin&quot;. The beginning chapter is based on an episode in which &quot;Tiger Slayer&quot; Wu Song avenges the murder of his older brother by brutally killing his brother&#x27;s former wife and murderer, Pan Jinlian. The story, ostensibly set during the years 1111–1127 (during the Northern Song dynasty), centers on Ximen Qing (), a corrupt social climber and lustful merchant who is wealthy enough to marry six wives and concubines.

After Pan Jinlian secretly murders her husband, Ximen Qing takes her as one of his wives. The story follows the domestic sexual struggles of the women within his household as they clamor for prestige and influence amidst the gradual decline of the Ximen clan. In &quot;Water Margin&quot;, Ximen Qing is brutally killed in broad daylight by Wu Song; in &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot;, Ximen Qing in the end dies from an overdose of aphrodisiacs administered by Jinlian to keep him aroused. The intervening sections, however, differ in almost every way from &quot;Water Margin&quot;. In the course of the novel, Ximen has 19 sexual partners, including his six wives and mistresses, and a male servant. There are 72 detailed sexual episodes in &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot;. However, considering the novel has over one million words (and over 3,600 pages in complete English translation), the graphic sexual scenes accounts for less than 3 percent of its total content.

==Evaluation==
For centuries identified as pornographic and officially banned most of the time, the book has nevertheless been read surreptitiously by many of the educated class. The early Qing dynasty critic Zhang Zhupo remarked that those who regard &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot; as pornographic &quot;read only the pornographic passages.&quot; The influential author Lu Xun, writing in the 1920s, called it &quot;the most famous of the novels of manners&quot; of the Ming dynasty, and reported the opinion of the Ming dynasty critic, Yuan Hongdao, that it was &quot;a classic second only to &quot;Shui Hu Zhuan&quot;.&quot; He added that the novel is &quot;in effect a condemnation of the whole ruling class.&quot;

The American scholar and literary critic Andrew H. Plaks ranks &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot; as one of the &quot;Four Masterworks of the Ming Novel&quot; along with &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Water Margin&quot;, and &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, which collectively constitute a technical breakthrough and reflect new cultural values and intellectual concerns. It has been described as a &quot;milestone&quot; in Chinese fiction for its character development, particularly its complex treatment of female figures. James Robert Hightower wrote in 1953 that along with &quot;The Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, it ranks with &quot;the greatest novels&quot; for &quot;scope, subtle delineation of character, and elaborate plot.&quot; Phillip S. Y. Sun argued that although in craftsmanship it is a lesser work than &quot;The Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, it surpasses the latter in &quot;depth and vigour&quot;.

The novel contains a surprising number of descriptions of sexual objects and coital techniques that would be considered fetish today, as well as a large number of bawdy jokes and oblique but titillating sexual euphemisms. Some critics have argued that the highly sexual descriptions are essential, and have exerted what has been termed a &quot;liberating&quot; influence on other Chinese novels that deal with sexuality, most notably the &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;. David Tod Roy (whose translation of the novel was published 1993–2013) sees an &quot;uncompromising moral vision,&quot; which he associates with the philosophy of Xunzi, who held that human nature is evil and can be redeemed only through moral transformation.

==Authorship==

The identity of the author has not yet been established, but the coherence of the style and the subtle symmetry of the narrative point to a single author. The British orientalist Arthur Waley, writing before recent research, in his Introduction to the 1942 translation suggested that the strongest candidate as author was Xu Wei, a renowned painter and member of the &quot;realistic&quot; Gong&#x27;an school of letters, urging that a comparison could be made of the poems in the &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot; to the poetic production of Xu Wei, but left this task to future scholars.

The &quot;morphing&quot; of the author from Xu Wei to Wang Shizhen would be explained by the practice of attributing &quot;a popular work of literature to some well-known writer of the period&quot;. Other proposed candidates include Li Kaixian and Tang Xianzu. In 2011, Zhejiang University scholar Xu Yongming argued that Bai Yue was possibly the author.

The novel contains extensive quotations and appropriations of the writings of other authors. According to &quot;The Cambridge History of Chinese Literature&quot;, &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot; sources include vernacular stories, pornography, histories, dramas, popular songs, jokes, and prosimetric narratives, as well as texts far outside of the parameters of the literary, such as official gazettes, contracts, and menus.&quot;

<text>The Dornier Do 10, originally designated Dornier Do C4, was the name given by the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) of a pre-World War II German aircraft.

It was a two-seat parasol-wing monoplane, intended to be used as a fighter. Two prototypes were built in 1931 to fulfil a requirement for a two-seat fighter. Having failed to gain a production order, the Do C4 / Do 10 was used to test a tilting engine installation and propellers to suit, for STOL tests.

<text>The post of Archbishop of Wales () was created in 1920 when the Church in Wales was separated from the Church of England and disestablished. The four historic Welsh dioceses had previously formed part of the Province of Canterbury, and so came under its Archbishop. The new Church became the Welsh province of the Anglican Communion.

Unlike the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, who are appointed by the King upon the advice of the Prime Minister, the Archbishop of Wales is one of the six diocesan bishops of Wales, elected to hold this office in addition to their own diocese.

With the establishment of the new province, there was debate as to whether a specific see should be made the primatial see, or if another solution should be adopted. Precedents were sought in the early history of Christianity in Wales, with St David&#x27;s having a debatable pre-eminence among the sees. A Roman Catholic Archbishopric of Cardiff had been created in 1916. Instead, it was decided that one of the diocesan bishops should hold the title Archbishop of Wales in addition to their own see. The circulating character of the post was justified by Welsh geography and by the ecclesiastical precedent of the province of Numidia (of which St Augustine of Hippo had been a bishop).
The archbishop is chosen in Llandrindod Wells, being a central point in the country. The first archbishop was chosen in the Old Parish Church in Llandrindod, but in more recent years, Holy Trinity Church has been used.

Successive archbishops have not only represented different geographical areas but also different tendencies within Anglicanism. In the mid-twentieth century linguistic issues were prominent in the successive incumbencies of Edwin Morris (who spoke no Welsh) and of Glyn Simon (who sympathised with advocates of the use of the Welsh language). Morris in some ways represented the broad churchmanship characteristic of the first occupant of the newly created post, A. G. Edwards, whereas Simon in many respects inherited the Anglo-Catholic outlook of the second archbishop, Charles Green (but without his authoritarianism). Towards the end of his period in office Gwilym Williams was one of three leading Welsh figures in a deputation to guarantee the status of the language which had been challenged by Margaret Thatcher. He was also decisive in the decision to ordain women priests. The former archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, subsequently Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, was Archbishop of Wales and Bishop of Monmouth.

Williams was succeeded by Barry Morgan, who signed &#x27;Barry Cambrensis&#x27;. Morgan oversaw the first consecration of a female bishop in the province, and was noted for his radicalism in other fields including same-sex marriage and his willingness to pronounce on political issues, including devolution, immigration, and organ donation. At the time of his retirement in 2017, he was the senior archbishop in the Anglican Communion by length of service.

The next archbishop was John Davies, who had been the senior bishop in the Church in Wales, and was elected on 6 September 2017 after acting as archbishop following Morgan&#x27;s retirement. He was the first Bishop of Swansea and Brecon to hold the post of archbishop. He retired both as Bishop of Swansea and Brecon and as archbishop on 2 May 2021. 

On 6 December 2021, Andy John, Bishop of Bangor, was elected to serve as Archbishop of Wales by an Electoral College of the Church in Wales meeting at Holy Trinity Church, Llandrindod Wells; his election was confirmed (and therefore he legally took up the archiepiscopal See) immediately.

Edwards, the first archbishop, Bishop of St Asaph, was supported in the diocese of St Asaph by the sole Bishop of Maenan; Glyn Simon and Barry Morgan were supported by Assistant Bishops of Llandaff. Andy John, Archbishop from 2021, appointed Mary Stallard to be Assistant Bishop of Bangor.

<doc id="464545" wikidata="Q82265" url="?curid=464545" title="Strepsirrhini">
<text>Strepsirrhini or Strepsirhini (; ) is a suborder of primates that includes the lemuriform primates, which consist of the lemurs of Madagascar, galagos (&quot;bushbabies&quot;) and pottos from Africa, and the lorises from India and southeast Asia. Collectively they are referred to as strepsirrhines. Also belonging to the suborder are the extinct adapiform primates which thrived during the Eocene in Europe, North America, and Asia, but disappeared from most of the Northern Hemisphere as the climate cooled. Adapiforms are sometimes referred to as being &quot;lemur-like&quot;, although the diversity of both lemurs and adapiforms does not support this comparison.

Strepsirrhines are defined by their &quot;wet&quot; (moist) rhinarium (the tip of the snout) – hence the colloquial but inaccurate term &quot;wet-nosed&quot; – similar to the rhinaria of canines and felines. They also have a smaller brain than comparably sized simians, large olfactory lobes for smell, a vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones, and a bicornuate uterus with an epitheliochorial placenta. Their eyes contain a reflective layer to improve their night vision, and their eye sockets include a ring of bone around the eye, but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a specialized set of teeth in the front, lower part of the mouth mostly used for combing fur during grooming.

Many of today&#x27;s living strepsirrhines are endangered due to habitat destruction, hunting for bushmeat, and live capture for the exotic pet trade. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines are behaviorally diverse, although all are primarily arboreal (tree-dwelling). Most living lemuriforms are nocturnal, while most adapiforms were diurnal. Both living and extinct groups primarily fed on fruit, leaves, and insects.

==Etymology==
The taxonomic name Strepsirrhini derives from the Greek &quot;strepsis&quot; &quot;a turning round&quot; and &quot;rhis&quot; &quot;nose, snout, (in pl.) nostrils&quot; ( &quot;rhinos&quot;), which refers to the appearance of the sinuous (comma-shaped) nostrils on the rhinarium or wet nose. The name was first used by French naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1812 as a subordinal rank comparable to Platyrrhini (New World monkeys) and Catarrhini (Old World monkeys). In his description, he mentioned &quot;Les narines terminales et sinueuses&quot; (&quot;Nostrils terminal and winding&quot;).

When British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock revived Strepsirrhini and defined Haplorhini in 1918, he omitted the second &quot;r&quot; from both (&quot;Strepsirhini&quot; and &quot;Haplorhini&quot; instead of &quot;Strepsirrhini&quot; and &quot;Haplorrhini&quot;), although he did not remove the second &quot;r&quot; from Platyrrhini or Catarrhini, both of which were also named by É. Geoffroy in 1812. Following Pocock, many researchers continued to spell Strepsirrhini with a single &quot;r&quot; until primatologists Paulina Jenkins and Prue Napier pointed out the error in 1987.

==Evolutionary history==
Strepsirrhines include the extinct adapiforms and the lemuriform primates, which include lemurs and lorisoids (lorises, pottos, and galagos). Strepsirrhines diverged from the haplorhine primates near the beginning of the primate radiation between 55 and 90 mya. Older divergence dates are based on genetic analysis estimates, while younger dates are based on the scarce fossil record. Lemuriform primates may have evolved from either cercamoniines or sivaladapids, both of which were adapiforms that may have originated in Asia. They were once thought to have evolved from adapids, a more specialized and younger branch of adapiform primarily from Europe.
Lemurs rafted from Africa to Madagascar between 47 and 54 mya, whereas the lorises split from the African galagos around 40 mya and later colonized Asia. The lemuriforms, and particularly the lemurs of Madagascar, are often portrayed inappropriately as &quot;living fossils&quot; or as examples of &quot;basal&quot;, or &quot;inferior&quot; primates. These views have historically hindered the understanding of mammalian evolution and the evolution of strepsirrhine traits, such as their reliance on smell (olfaction), characteristics of their skeletal anatomy, and their brain size, which is relatively small. In the case of lemurs, natural selection has driven this isolated population of primates to diversify significantly and fill a rich variety of ecological niches, despite their smaller and less complex brains compared to simians.

===Unclear origin===
The divergence between strepsirrhines, simians, and tarsiers likely followed almost immediately after primates first evolved. Although few fossils of living primate groups – lemuriforms, tarsiers, and simians – are known from the Early to Middle Eocene, evidence from genetics and recent fossil finds both suggest they may have been present during the early adaptive radiation.

The origin of the earliest primates that the simians and tarsiers both evolved from is a mystery. Both their place of origin and the group from which they emerged are uncertain. Although the fossil record demonstrating their initial radiation across the Northern Hemisphere is very detailed, the fossil record from the tropics (where primates most likely first developed) is very sparse, particularly around the time that primates and other major clades of eutherian mammals first appeared.

Lacking detailed tropical fossils, geneticists and primatologists have used genetic analyses to determine the relatedness between primate lineages and the amount of time since they diverged. Using this molecular clock, divergence dates for the major primate lineages have suggested that primates evolved more than 80–90 mya, nearly 40 million years before the first examples appear in the fossil record.

The early primates include both nocturnal and diurnal small-bodied species, and all were arboreal, with hands and feet specially adapted for maneuvering on small branches. Plesiadapiforms from the early Paleocene are sometimes considered &quot;archaic primates&quot;, because their teeth resembled those of early primates and because they possessed adaptations to living in trees, such as a divergent big toe (hallux). Although plesiadapiforms were closely related to primates, they may represent a paraphyletic group from which primates may or may not have directly evolved, and some genera may have been more closely related to colugos, which are thought to be more closely related to primates.
The first true primates (euprimates) do not appear in the fossil record until the early Eocene (~55 mya), at which point they radiated across the Northern Hemisphere during a brief period of rapid global warming known as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. These first primates included &quot;Cantius&quot;, &quot;Donrussellia&quot;, &quot;Altanius&quot;, and &quot;Teilhardina&quot; on the northern continents, as well as the more questionable (and fragmentary) fossil &quot;Altiatlasius&quot; from Paleocene Africa. These earliest fossil primates are often divided into two groups, adapiforms and omomyiforms. Both appeared suddenly in the fossil record without transitional forms to indicate ancestry, and both groups were rich in diversity and were widespread throughout the Eocene.

The last branch to develop were the adapiforms, a diverse and widespread group that thrived during the Eocene (56 to 34 million years ago mya]) in Europe, North America, and Asia. They disappeared from most of the Northern Hemisphere as the climate cooled: The last of the adapiforms died out at the end of the Miocene (~7 mya).
===Adapiform evolution===
Adapiform primates are extinct strepsirrhines that shared many anatomical similarities with lemurs. They are sometimes referred to as lemur-like primates, although the diversity of both lemurs and adapiforms do not support this analogy.

Like the living strepsirrhines, adapiforms were extremely diverse, with at least 30 genera and 80 species known from the fossil record as of the early 2000s. They diversified across Laurasia during the Eocene, some reaching North America via a land bridge.They were among the most common mammals found in the fossil beds from that time. A few rare species have also been found in northern Africa. The most basal of the adapiforms include the genera &quot;Cantius&quot; from North America and Europe and &quot;Donrussellia&quot; from Europe. The latter bears the most ancestral traits, so it is often considered a sister group or stem group of the other adapiforms.

Adapiforms are often divided into three major groups:
* Adapids were most commonly found in Europe, although the oldest specimens (&quot;Adapoides&quot; from middle Eocene China) indicate that they most likely evolved in Asia and immigrated. They died out in Europe during the Grande Coupure, part of a significant extinction event at the end of the Eocene.
* Notharctids, which most closely resembled some of Madagascar&#x27;s lemurs, come from Europe and North America. The European branch is often referred to as cercamoniines. The North American branch thrived during the Eocene, but did not survive into the Oligocene. Like the adapids, the European branch were also extinct by the end of the Eocene.
* Sivaladapids of southern and eastern Asia are best known from the Miocene, and the only adapiforms to survive past the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (~34 mya). Their relationship to the other adapiforms remains unclear. They had vanished before the end of the Miocene (~7 mya).

The relationship between adapiform and lemuriform primates has not been clearly demonstrated, so the position of adapiforms as a paraphyletic stem group is questionable. Both molecular clock data and new fossil finds suggest that the lemuriform divergence from the other primates and the subsequent lemur-lorisoid split both predate the appearance of adapiforms in the early Eocene. New calibration methods may reconcile the discrepancies between the molecular clock and the fossil record, favoring more recent divergence dates. The fossil record suggests that the strepsirrhine adapiforms and the haplorhine omomyiforms had been evolving independently before the early Eocene, although their most basal members share enough dental similarities to suggest that they diverged during the Paleocene (66–55 mya).

===Lemuriform evolution===

Lemuriform origins are unclear and debated. American paleontologist Philip Gingerich proposed that lemuriform primates evolved from one of several genera of European adapids based on similarities between the front lower teeth of adapids and the toothcomb of extant lemuriforms; however, this view is not strongly supported due to a lack of clear transitional fossils. Instead, lemuriforms may be descended from a very early branch of Asian cercamoniines or sivaladapids that migrated to northern Africa.

Until discoveries of three 40 million-year-old fossil lorisoids (&quot;Karanisia&quot;, &quot;Saharagalago&quot;, and &quot;Wadilemur&quot;) in the El Fayum deposits of Egypt between 1997 and 2005, the oldest known lemuriforms had come from the early Miocene (~20 mya) of Kenya and Uganda. These newer finds demonstrate that lemuriform primates were present during the middle Eocene in Afro-Arabia and that the lemuriform lineage and all other strepsirrhine taxa had diverged before then. &quot;Djebelemur&quot; from Tunisia dates to the late early or early middle Eocene (52 to 46 mya) and has been considered a cercamoniine, but also may have been a stem lemuriform. Azibiids from Algeria date to roughly the same time and may be a sister group of the djebelemurids. Together with &quot;Plesiopithecus&quot; from the late Eocene Egypt, the three may qualify as the stem lemuriforms from Africa.

Molecular clock estimates indicate that lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in Africa during the Paleocene, approximately 62 mya. Between 47 and 54 mya, lemurs dispersed to Madagascar by rafting. In isolation, the lemurs diversified and filled the niches often filled by monkeys and apes today. In Africa, the lorises and galagos diverged during the Eocene, approximately 40 mya. Unlike the lemurs in Madagascar, they have had to compete with monkeys and apes, as well as other mammals.

==History of classification==
The taxonomy of strepsirrhines is controversial and has a complicated history. Confused taxonomic terminology and oversimplified anatomical comparisons have created misconceptions about primate and strepsirrhine phylogeny, illustrated by the media attention surrounding the single &quot;Ida&quot; fossil in 2009.

Strepsirrhine primates were first grouped under the genus &quot;Lemur&quot; by Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; published in 1758. At the time, only three species were recognized, one of which (the colugo) is no longer recognized as a primate. In 1785, Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert divided the genus &quot;Lemur&quot; into two genera: &quot;Prosimia&quot; for the lemurs, colugos, and tarsiers and &quot;Tardigradus&quot; for the lorises. Ten years later, É. Geoffroy and Georges Cuvier grouped the tarsiers and galagos due to similarities in their hindlimb morphology, a view supported by German zoologist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger, who placed them in the family Macrotarsi while placing the lemurs and tarsiers in the family Prosimia (Prosimii) in 1811. The use of the tarsier-galago classification continued for many years until 1898, when Dutch zoologist Ambrosius Hubrecht demonstrated two different types of placentation (formation of a placenta) in the two groups.

English comparative anatomist William Henry Flower created the suborder Lemuroidea in 1883 to distinguish these primates from the simians, which were grouped under English biologist St. George Jackson Mivart&#x27;s suborder Anthropoidea (=Simiiformes). According to Flower, the suborder Lemuroidea contained the families Lemuridae (lemurs, lorises, and galagos), Chiromyidae (aye-aye), and Tarsiidae (tarsiers). Lemuroidea was later replaced by Illiger&#x27;s suborder Prosimii. Many years earlier, in 1812, É. Geoffroy first named the suborder Strepsirrhini, in which he included the tarsiers. This taxonomy went unnoticed until 1918, when Pocock compared the structure of the nose and reinstated the use of the suborder Strepsirrhini, while also moving the tarsiers and the simians into a new suborder, Haplorhini. It was not until 1953, when British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill wrote an entire volume on strepsirrhine anatomy, that Pocock&#x27;s taxonomic suggestion became noticed and more widely used. Since then, primate taxonomy has shifted between Strepsirrhini-Haplorhini and Prosimii-Anthropoidea multiple times.

Most of the academic literature provides a basic framework for primate taxonomy, usually including several potential taxonomic schemes. Although most experts agree upon phylogeny, many disagree about nearly every level of primate classification.


===Controversies===
The most commonly recurring debate in primatology during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 2000s concerned the phylogenetic position of tarsiers compared to both simians and the other prosimians. Tarsiers are most often placed in either the suborder Haplorhini with the simians or in the suborder Prosimii with the strepsirrhines. Prosimii is one of the two traditional primate suborders and is based on evolutionary grades (groups united by anatomical traits) rather than phylogenetic clades, while the Strepsirrhini-Haplorrhini taxonomy was based on evolutionary relationships. Yet both systems persist because the Prosimii-Anthropoidea taxonomy is familiar and frequently seen in the research literature and textbooks.

Strepsirrhines are traditionally characterized by several symplesiomorphic (ancestral) traits not shared with the simians, particularly the rhinarium. Other symplesiomorphies include long snouts, convoluted maxilloturbinals, relatively large olfactory bulbs, and smaller brains. The toothcomb is a synapomorphy (shared, derived trait) seen among lemuriforms, although it is frequently and incorrectly used to define the strepsirrhine clade. Strepsirrhine primates are also united in possessing an epitheliochorial placenta. Unlike the tarsiers and simians, strepsirrhines are capable of producing their own and do not need it supplied in their diet. Further genetic evidence for the relationship between tarsiers and simians as a haplorhine clade is the shared possession of three SINE markers.

Because of their historically mixed assemblages which included tarsiers and close relatives of primates, both Prosimii and Strepsirrhini have been considered wastebasket taxa for &quot;lower primates&quot;. Regardless, the strepsirrhine and haplorrhine clades are generally accepted and viewed as the preferred taxonomic division. Yet tarsiers still closely resemble both strepsirrhines and simians in different ways, and since the early split between strepsirrhines, tarsiers and simians is ancient and hard to resolve, a third taxonomic arrangement with three suborders is sometimes used: Prosimii, Tarsiiformes, and Anthropoidea. More often, the term &quot;prosimian&quot; is no longer used in official taxonomy, but is still used to illustrate the behavioral ecology of tarsiers relative to the other primates.

In addition to the controversy over tarsiers, the debate over the origins of simians once called the strepsirrhine clade into question. Arguments for an evolutionary link between adapiforms and simians made by paleontologists Gingerich, Elwyn L. Simons, Tab Rasmussen, and others could have potentially excluded adapiforms from Strepsirrhini. In 1975, Gingerich proposed a new suborder, Simiolemuriformes, to suggest that strepsirrhines are more closely related to simians than tarsiers. However, no clear relationship between the two had been demonstrated by the early 2000s. The idea reemerged briefly in 2009 during the media attention surrounding &quot;Darwinius masillae&quot; (dubbed &quot;Ida&quot;), a cercamoniine from Germany that was touted as a &quot;missing link between humans and earlier primates&quot; (simians and adapiforms). However, the cladistic analysis was flawed and the phylogenetic inferences and terminology were vague. Although the authors noted that &quot;Darwinius&quot; was not a &quot;fossil lemur&quot;, they did emphasize the absence of a toothcomb, which adapiforms did not possess.

===Infraordinal classification and clade terminology===


Within Strepsirrhini, two common classifications include either two infraorders (Adapiformes and Lemuriformes) or three infraorders (Adapiformes, Lemuriformes, Lorisiformes). A less common taxonomy places the aye-aye (Daubentoniidae) in its own infraorder, Chiromyiformes. In some cases, plesiadapiforms are included within the order Primates, in which case Euprimates is sometimes treated as a suborder, with Strepsirrhini becoming an infraorder, and the Lemuriformes and others become parvorders. Regardless of the infraordinal taxonomy, Strepsirrhini is composed of three ranked superfamilies and 14 families, seven of which are extinct. Three of these extinct families included the recently extinct giant lemurs of Madagascar, many of which died out within the last 1,000 years following human arrival on the island.

When Strepsirrhini is divided into two infraorders, the clade containing all toothcombed primates can be called &quot;lemuriforms&quot;. When it is divided into three infraorders, the term &quot;lemuriforms&quot; refers only to Madagascar&#x27;s lemurs, and the toothcombed primates are referred to as either &quot;crown strepsirrhines&quot; or &quot;extant strepsirrhines&quot;. Confusion of this specific terminology with the general term &quot;strepsirrhine&quot;, along with oversimplified anatomical comparisons and vague phylogenetic inferences, can lead to misconceptions about primate phylogeny and misunderstandings about primates from the Eocene, as seen with the media coverage of &quot;Darwinius&quot;. Because the skeletons of adapiforms share strong similarities with those of lemurs and lorises, researchers have often referred to them as &quot;primitive&quot; strepsirrhines, lemur ancestors, or a sister group to the living strepsirrhines. They are included in Strepsirrhini, and are considered basal members of the clade. Although their status as true primates is not questioned, the questionable relationship between adapiforms and other living and fossil primates leads to multiple classifications within Strepsirrhini. Often, adapiforms are placed in their own infraorder due to anatomical differences with lemuriforms and their unclear relationship. When shared traits with lemuriforms (which may or may not be synapomorphic) are emphasized, they are sometimes reduced to families within the infraorder Lemuriformes (or superfamily Lemuroidea).

The first fossil primate described was the adapiform &quot;Adapis parisiensis&quot; by French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1821, who compared it to a hyrax (&quot;le Daman&quot;), then considered a member of a now obsolete group called pachyderms. It was not recognized as a primate until it was reevaluated in the early 1870s. Originally, adapiforms were all included under the family Adapidae, which was divided into two or three subfamilies: Adapinae, Notharctinae, and sometimes Sivaladapinae. All North American adapiforms were lumped under Notharctinae, while the Old World forms were usually assigned to Adapinae. Around the 1990s, two distinct groups of European &quot;adapids&quot; began to emerge, based on differences in the postcranial skeleton and the teeth. One of these two European forms was identified as cercamoniines, which were allied with the notharctids found mostly in North America, while the other group falls into the traditional adapid classification. The three major adapiform divisions are now typically regarded as three families within Adapiformes (Notharctidae, Adapidae and Sivaladapidae), but other divisions ranging from one to five families are used as well.
==Anatomy and physiology==
===Grooming apparatus===

All lemuriforms possess a specialized dental structure called a &quot;toothcomb&quot;, with the exception of the aye-aye, in which the structure has been modified into two continually growing (hypselodont) incisors (or canine teeth), similar to those of rodents. Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms.

Lemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot for scratching in areas that are inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. Adapiforms may have had a grooming claw, but there is little evidence of this. The toothcomb consists of either two or four lower incisors and procumbent lower canine teeth followed by a canine-shaped premolar. It is used to comb the fur during oral grooming. Shed hairs that accumulate between the teeth of the toothcomb are removed by the sublingua or &quot;under-tongue&quot;. Adapiforms did not possess a toothcomb. Instead, their lower incisors varied in orientation – from somewhat procumbent to somewhat vertical – and the lower canines were projected upwards and were often prominent.

===Eyes===
Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a protective ring of bone created by a connection between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving stereoscopic vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea. The relative size of cornea in strepsirrhines is similar to nonprimate nocturnal and cathemeral mammals, where as haplorhines have smaller relative sized cornea compared to most nonprimate mammals.

===Skull===

Strepsirrhine primates have a brain relatively comparable to or slightly larger in size than most mammals. Compared to simians, however, they have a relatively small brain-to-body size ratio. Strepsirrhines are also traditionally noted for their unfused mandibular symphysis (two halves of the lower jaw), however, fusion of the mandibular symphysis was common in adapiforms, notably &quot;Notharctus&quot;. Also, several extinct giant lemurs exhibited a fused mandibular symphysis.

===Ears===
Many nocturnal species have large, independently movable ears, although there are significant differences in sizes and shapes of the ear between species. The structure of the middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, the tympanic cavity, which surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the ectotympanic ring, which supports the eardrum, free within the auditory bulla. This trait is also seen in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, the tympanic cavity is smaller and the ectotympanic ring becomes attached to the edge of the auditory bulla. The tympanic cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not present in lemurs.

===Neck arteries===
Both lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs have replaced the internal carotid artery with an enlarged ascending pharyngeal artery.

===Ankle bones===
Strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus (ankle bones) that differentiate them from haplorhines, such as a sloping talo-fibular facet (the face where the talus bone and fibula meet) and a difference in the location of the position of the flexor fibularis tendon on the talus. These differences give strepsirrhines the ability to make more complex rotations of the ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted, or turned inward, an adaptation for grasping vertical supports.

===Sex characteristics===
Sexual dichromatism (different coloration patterns between males and females) can be seen in most brown lemur species, but otherwise lemurs show very little if any difference in body size or weight between sexes. This lack of sexual dimorphism is not characteristic of all strepsirrhines. Some adapiforms were sexually dimorphic, with males bearing a larger sagittal crest (a ridge of bone on the top of the skull to which jaw muscles attach) and canine teeth. Lorisoids exhibit some sexual dimorphism, but males are typically no more than 20 percent larger than females.
===Rhinarium and olfaction===

Strepsirrhines have a long snout that ends in a moist and touch-sensitive rhinarium, similar to that of dogs and many other mammals. The rhinarium is surrounded by vibrissae that are also sensitive to touch. Convoluted maxilloturbinals on the inside of their nose filter, warm, and moisten the incoming air, while olfactory receptors of the main olfactory system lining the ethmoturbinals detect airborne smells. The olfactory bulbs of lemurs are comparable in size to those of other arboreal mammals.

The surface of the rhinarium does not have any olfactory receptors, so it is not used for smell in terms of detecting volatile substances. Instead, it has sensitive touch receptors (Merkel cells). The rhinarium, upper lip, and gums are tightly connected by a fold of mucous membrane called the philtrum, which runs from the tip of the nose to the mouth. The upper lip is constrained by this connection and has fewer nerves to control movement, which leaves it less mobile than the upper lips of simians. The philtrum creates a gap (diastema) between the roots of the first two upper incisors.

The strepsirrhine rhinarium can collect relatively non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as pheromones) and transmit them to the vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located below and in front of the nasal cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory olfactory bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to the amygdala, which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main olfactory system.

All lemuriforms have a VNO, as do tarsiers and some New World monkeys. Adapiforms exhibit the gap between the upper incisors, which indicates the presence of a VNO, but there is some disagreement over whether or not they possessed a rhinarium.

===Reproductive physiology===
Extant strepsirrhines have an epitheliochorial placenta, where the maternal blood does not come in direct contact with the fetal chorion like it does in the hemochorial placenta of haplorhines. The strepsirrhine uterus has two distinct chambers (bicornuate). Despite having similar gestation periods to comparably sized haplorhines, fetal growth rates are generally slower in strepsirrhines, which results in newborn offspring that are as little as one-third the size of haplorhine newborns. Extant strepsirrhines also have a lower basal metabolic rate, which elevates in females during gestation, putting greater demands on the mother.

Most primates have two mammary glands, but the number and positions vary between species within strepsirrhines. Lorises have two pairs, while others, like the ring-tailed lemur, have one pair on the chest (pectoral). The aye-aye also has two mammary glands, but they are located near the groin (inguinal). In females, the clitoris is sometimes enlarged and pendulous, resembling the male penis, which can make sex identification difficult for human observers. The clitoris may also have a bony structure in it, similar to the baculum (penis bone) in males. Most male primates have a baculum, but it is typically larger in strepsirrhines and usually forked at the tip.

==Behavior==

Approximately three-quarters of all extant strepsirrhine species are nocturnal, sleeping in nests made from dead leaves or tree hollows during the day. All of the lorisoids from continental Africa and Asia are nocturnal, a circumstance that minimizes their competition with the simian primates of the region, which are diurnal. The lemurs of Madagascar, living in the absence of simians, are more variable in their activity cycles. The aye-aye, mouse lemurs, woolly lemurs, and sportive lemurs are nocturnal, while ring-tailed lemurs and most of their kin, sifakas, and indri are diurnal. Yet some or all of the brown lemurs (&quot;Eulemur&quot;) are cathemeral, which means that they may be active during the day or night, depending on factors such as temperature and predation. Many extant strepsirrhines are well adapted for nocturnal activity due to their relatively large eyes; large, movable ears; sensitive tactile hairs; strong sense of smell; and the tapetum lucidum behind the retina. Among the adapiforms, most are considered diurnal, with the exception of &quot;Pronycticebus&quot; and &quot;Godinotia&quot; from Middle Eocene Europe, both of which had large orbits that suggest nocturnality.

Reproduction in most strepsirrhine species tends to be seasonal, particularly in lemurs. Key factors that affect seasonal reproduction include the length of the wet season, subsequent food availability, and the maturation time of the species. Like other primates, strepsirrhines are relatively slow breeders compared to other mammals. Their gestation period and interbirth intervals are usually long, and the young develop slowly, just like in haplorhine primates. Unlike simians, some strepsirrhines produce two or three offspring, although some produce only a single offspring. Those that produce multiple offspring tend to build nests for their young. These two traits are thought to be plesiomorphic (ancestral) for primates. The young are precocial (relatively mature and mobile) at birth, but not as coordinated as ungulates (hoofed mammals). Infant care by the mother is relatively prolonged compared to many other mammals, and in some cases, the infants cling to the mother&#x27;s fur with their hands and feet.

Despite their relatively smaller brains compared to other primates, lemurs have demonstrated levels of technical intelligence in problem solving that are comparable to those seen in simians. However, their social intelligence differs, often emphasizing within-group competition over cooperation, which may be due to adaptations for their unpredictable environment. Although lemurs have not been observed using objects as tools in the wild, they can be trained to use objects as tools in captivity and demonstrate a basic understanding about the functional properties of the objects they are using.

===Social systems and communication===
The nocturnal strepsirrhines have been traditionally described as &quot;solitary&quot;, although this term is no longer favored by the researchers who study them. Many are considered &quot;solitary foragers&quot;, but many exhibit complex and diverse social organization, often overlapping home ranges, initiating social contact at night, and sharing sleeping sites during the day. Even the mating systems are variable, as seen in woolly lemurs, which live in monogamous breeding pairs. Because of this social diversity among these solitary but social primates, whose level of social interaction is comparable to that of diurnal simians, alternative classifications have been proposed to emphasize their gregarious, dispersed, or solitary nature.

Among extant strepsirrhines, only the diurnal and cathemeral lemurs have evolved to live in multi-male/multi-female groups, comparable to most living simians. This social trait, seen in two extant lemur families (Indriidae and Lemuridae), is thought to have evolved independently. Group sizes are smaller in social lemurs than in simians, and despite the similarities, the community structures differ. Female dominance, which is rare in simians, is fairly common in lemurs. Strepsirrhines spend a considerable amount of time grooming each other (allogrooming). When lemuriform primates groom, they lick the fur and then comb it with their toothcomb. They also use their grooming claw to scratch places they cannot reach with their mouth.

Like New World monkeys, strepsirrhines rely on scent marking for much of their communication. This involves smearing secretions from epidermal scent glands on tree branches, along with urine and feces. In some cases, strepsirrhines may anoint themselves with urine (urine washing). Body postures and gestures may be used, although the long snout, non-mobile lips, and reduced facial enervation restrict the use of facial expressions in strepsirrhines. Short-range calls, long-range calls, and alarm calls are also used. Nocturnal species are more constrained by the lack of light, so their communication systems differ from those of diurnal species, often using long-range calls to claim their territory.

===Locomotion===

Living strepsirrhines are predominantly arboreal, with only the ring-tailed lemur spending considerable time on the ground. Most species move around quadrupedally (on four legs) in the trees, including five genera of smaller, nocturnal lemurs. Galagos, indriids, sportive lemurs, and bamboo lemurs leap from vertical surfaces, and the indriids are highly specialized for vertical clinging and leaping. Lorises are slow-moving, deliberate climbers.

Analyses of extinct adapiforms postcranial skeletons suggest a variety of locomotor behavior. The European adapids &quot;Adapis&quot;, &quot;Palaeolemur&quot;, and &quot;Leptadapis&quot; shared adaptations for slow climbing like the lorises, although they may have been quadrupedal runners like small New World monkeys. Both &quot;Notharctus&quot; and &quot;Smilodectes&quot; from North America and &quot;Europolemur&quot; from Europe exhibit limb proportions and joint surfaces comparable to vertical clinging and leaping lemurs, but were not as specialized as indriids for vertical clinging, suggesting that they ran along branches and did not leap as much. Notharctids &quot;Cantius&quot; and &quot;Pronycticebus&quot; appear to have been agile arboreal quadrupeds, with adaptations comparable to the brown lemurs.

===Diet===
Primates primarily feed on fruits (including seeds), leaves (including flowers), and animal prey (arthropods, small vertebrates, and eggs). Diets vary markedly between strepsirrhine species. Like other leaf-eating (folivorous) primates, some strepsirrhines can digest cellulose and hemicellulose. Some strepsirrhines, such as the galagos, slender lorises, and angwantibos, are primarily insectivorous. Other species, such as fork-marked lemurs and needle-clawed bushbabies, specialize on tree gum, while indriids, sportive lemurs, and bamboo lemurs are folivores. Many strepsirrhines are frugivores (fruit eaters), and others, like the ring-tailed lemur and mouse lemurs, are omnivores, eating a mix of fruit, leaves, and animal matter.

Among the adapiforms, frugivory seems to have been the most common diet, particularly for medium-sized to large species, such as &quot;Cantius&quot;, &quot;Pelycodus&quot; and &quot;Cercamonius&quot;. Folivory was also common among the medium and large-sized adapiforms, including &quot;Smilodectes&quot;, &quot;Notharctus&quot;, &quot;Adapis&quot; and &quot;Leptadapis&quot;. Sharp cusps on the teeth of some of the smaller adapiforms, such as &quot;Anchomomys&quot; and &quot;Donrussellia&quot;, indicate that they were either partly or primarily insectivorous.

==Distribution and habitat==
The now extinct adapiform primates were primarily found across North America, Asia, and Europe, with a few species in Africa. They flourished during the Eocene when those regions were more tropical in nature, and they disappeared when the climate became cooler and drier. Today, the lemuriforms are confined in the tropics, ranging between 28° S to 26° N latitude. Lorises are found both in equatorial Africa and Southeast Asia, while the galagos are limited to the forests and woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. Lemurs are endemic to Madagascar, although much of their diversity and habitat has been lost due to recent human activity.

As with nearly all primates, strepsirrhines typically reside in tropical rainforests. These habitats allow strepsirrhines and other primates to evolve diverse communities of sympatric species. In the eastern rainforests of Madagascar, as many as 11 or 12 species share the same forests, and prior to human arrival, some forests had nearly double that diversity. Several species of lemur are found in drier, seasonal forests, including the spiny forest on the southern tip of the island, although the lemur communities in these regions are not as rich.
==Conservation==
Like all other non-human primates, strepsirrhines face an elevated risk of extinction due to human activity, particularly deforestation in tropical regions. Much of their habitat has been converted for human use, such as agriculture and pasture. The threats facing strepsirrhine primates fall into three main categories: habitat destruction, hunting (for bushmeat or traditional medicine), and live capture for export or local exotic pet trade. Although hunting is often prohibited, the laws protecting them are rarely enforced. In Madagascar, local taboos known as &quot;fady&quot; sometimes help protect lemur species, although some are still hunted for traditional medicine.

In 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced that lemurs were the &quot;most endangered mammals&quot;, due largely to elevated illegal logging and hunting following a political crisis in 2009. In Southeast Asia, slow lorises are threatened by the exotic pet trade and traditional medicine, in addition to habitat destruction. Both lemurs and slow lorises are protected from commercial international trade under CITES Appendix I.

<doc id="464554" wikidata="Q242785" url="?curid=464554" title="Carole Landis">
<text>Carole Landis (born Frances Lillian Mary Ridste; January 1, 1919 – July 5, 1948) was an American actress and singer. She worked as a contract player for Twentieth Century-Fox in the 1940s. Her breakout role was as the female lead in the 1940 film &quot;One Million B.C.&quot; from United Artists. She was known as &quot;The Ping Girl&quot; and &quot;The Chest&quot; because of her curvy figure.

==Early life==
Landis was born on January 1, 1919, in Fairchild, Wisconsin, the youngest of five children of Clara (née Sentek), a Polish farmer&#x27;s daughter, and Norwegian-American Alfred Ridste, a drifting railroad mechanic who abandoned the family after Landis&#x27;s birth. According to Landis&#x27;s biographer E. J. Fleming, circumstantial evidence supports that Landis was likely the biological child of her mother&#x27;s second husband, Charles Fenner. Fenner left Landis&#x27;s mother in April 1921 and remarried a few months later.

In 1923, Landis&#x27;s family moved to San Bernardino, California, where her mother worked menial jobs to support the family. At the age of 15, Landis dropped out of San Bernardino High School and set forth on a career path to show business. She started out as a hula dancer in a San Francisco nightclub, where she was described by her boss as a &quot;nervous $35-a-week blonde doing a pathetic hula at her opening night at the old Royal Hawaiian on Bush [Street]...that&#x27;ll never get her anyplace in show business&quot;. He apparently employed her only because he felt sorry for her; she later sang with a dance band. She bleached her hair blonde and changed her name to &quot;Carole Landis&quot; after her favorite actress, Carole Lombard. After saving $100, she moved to Hollywood.

==Career==
===Film career===
Landis made her film debut as an extra in the 1937 film &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;. She also appeared in various horse operas. She posed for hundreds of cheesecake photographs. She continued appearing in bit parts until 1940, when Hal Roach cast her as a cave girl in &quot;One Million B.C.&quot;. The movie was a sensation and turned Landis into a star. A press agent nicknamed her &quot;The Ping Girl&quot; (an awkward contraction of &quot;purring&quot;).
Landis appeared in a string of successful films in the early 1940s, usually as the second female lead. In a time when the singing of many actresses was dubbed in, Landis&#x27;s own voice was considered good enough and was used in her few musical roles. Landis landed a contract with Twentieth Century-Fox and began a sexual relationship with Darryl F. Zanuck. She had roles playing opposite fellow pin-up girl Betty Grable in the musical &quot;Moon Over Miami&quot; and crime drama &quot;I Wake Up Screaming&quot;, both in 1941. When Landis ended her relationship with Zanuck, her career suffered and she was assigned roles in B-movies.

Her final two films, &quot;Noose&quot; and &quot;Brass Monkey&quot;, were both made in Great Britain.

===USO Tours===
She became a popular pin-up with servicemen during World War II.

===Broadway===
In 1945 she starred on Broadway in the musical &quot;A Lady Says Yes&quot;, with future novelist Jacqueline Susann in a small role. Susann is said to have based the character of Jennifer North, from her best-selling novel &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, in part on Landis.

===Writing===
Landis wrote several newspaper and magazine articles about her experiences during the war, including the 1944 book &quot;Four Jills in a Jeep&quot;, which was later made into a movie costarring Kay Francis, Martha Raye, and Mitzi Mayfair. She also wrote the foreword to Vic Herman&#x27;s cartoon book &quot;Winnie the WAC&quot;.

==Personal life==

Landis was married four times and had no children (she was unable to conceive owing to endometriosis). In January 1934, 15-year-old Landis married her first husband, 19-year-old Irving Wheeler. Her mother had the marriage annulled in February 1934. Landis persuaded her father, Alfred Ridste (who had left the family shortly after Landis was born and who, by coincidence, lived near the family in San Bernardino), to allow her to remarry Wheeler. He finally relented, and the two were remarried on August 25, 1934. After three weeks of marriage, Landis and Wheeler got into an argument and Landis walked out. Neither filed for divorce, and Landis began pursuing an acting career. In 1938, Wheeler reappeared and filed a $250,000 alienation of affections lawsuit against director and choreographer Busby Berkeley. Even though Landis and Wheeler were estranged, he claimed that Berkeley had enticed and otherwise persuaded Landis to transfer her affections. Landis maintained that she had not seen Wheeler in years and heard from him only the previous year when he claimed to want a divorce. Wheeler&#x27;s lawsuit was later dismissed, and Landis and Wheeler were divorced in 1939.

In June 1939 Berkeley proposed to Landis but later broke it off. On July 4, 1940, she married yacht broker Willis Hunt Jr. in Las Vegas. Landis left Hunt after two months of marriage; they were divorced in November 1940.

While touring army camps in London in 1942, she met United States Army Air Forces Captain Thomas Wallace. They were married in January 1943, and the wedding received a two-page photo spread in &quot;Life&quot; magazine. The couple separated in May 1945, and they divorced in July 1945.

On December 8, 1945, Landis married Broadway producer W. Horace Schmidlapp. They separated in 1947 and Landis filed for divorce in May 1948, charging Schmidlapp with &quot;extreme mental cruelty.&quot;
During her separation from Schmidlapp, Landis began a relationship with actor Rex Harrison, who was then married to actress Lilli Palmer. The affair became an open secret in Hollywood. After Landis&#x27;s death, however, Harrison downplayed their relationship and publicly claimed that she was merely a close friend of himself and Palmer.

==Death==
Landis was reportedly crushed when Harrison refused to divorce his wife for her. Unable to cope any longer, on July 5, 1948, she died by suicide in her Pacific Palisades home at 1465 Capri Drive by taking an overdose of Seconal. Harrison was the last person to see her alive, having had dinner with her the night before she committed suicide.

The next afternoon, Harrison and Landis&#x27;s maid discovered her on the bathroom floor. Harrison waited several hours before he called a doctor and the police. According to some sources, Landis left two suicide notes, one for her mother and the second for Harrison, who instructed his lawyers to destroy it. During a coroner&#x27;s inquest, Harrison denied knowing any motive for her suicide and told the coroner he did not know of the existence of a second suicide note. Landis&#x27;s official website, which is owned by her family, has questioned the events of Landis&#x27;s death and the coroner&#x27;s ruling of suicide. She is interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California, in plot 814 of the &quot;Everlasting Love&quot; section. Among the celebrities at her funeral were Cesar Romero, Van Johnson, and Pat O&#x27;Brien. Harrison attended with his wife.

Landis has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1765 Vine Street.

<doc id="464559" wikidata="Q650757" url="?curid=464559" title="Scramble (video game)">
<text>is a horizontally scrolling shooter arcade video game released by Konami in 1981. It was distributed by Leijac for manufacture in Japan and Stern in North America. It was the first side-scrolling shooter with forced scrolling and multiple distinct levels, and it established the foundation for a new genre.

It was Konami&#x27;s first major worldwide hit. In the United States, it sold 15,136 arcade cabinets within five months and became Stern&#x27;s second best-selling game. &quot;Scramble&quot; was not ported to any major contemporary consoles or computers, but there were releases for the Tomy Tutor and Vectrex as well as dedicated tabletop/handheld versions. Unauthorized clones for the VIC-20 and Commodore 64 used the same name as the original. The BBC Micro clone was called &quot;Rocket Raid&quot;, marketed by Acornsoft from 1982 and primarily within the UK. &quot;Scramble&quot;″s sequel, the more difficult &quot;Super Cobra&quot;, was released later that year. &quot;Gradius&quot; (1985) was originally intended to be a follow-up to &quot;Scramble&quot;.

==Gameplay==

The player controls a futuristic aircraft, referred to in the game as a jet, and has to guide it across scrolling terrain, battling obstacles along the way. The jet is armed with a forward-firing weapon and bombs; each weapon has its own button. The player must avoid colliding with the terrain and other enemies while simultaneously maintaining its limited fuel supply, which diminishes over time. More fuel can be acquired by destroying fuel tanks in the game.

The game is divided into six sections, each with a different style of terrain and various obstacles. There is no intermission between each section; the game seamlessly scrolls into the new terrain. Points are awarded based on the duration of survival, as well as for destroying enemies and fuel tanks. In the final section, the player must destroy a &quot;base&quot;. Once this objective is achieved, a flag indicating a completed mission is displayed at the bottom right of the screen. The game then repeats, returning to the first section with a slight increase in difficulty.

===Scoring===
* Per second the jet is in play: 10 points
* Rockets: 50 points on ground, 80 in air
* UFO ships: 100 points
* Fuel tanks: 150 points
* Mystery targets: 100, 200, or 300 points
* Base at ends of levels: 800 points

The player is awarded an extra jet for scoring 10,000 points, and none more thereafter. A jet is lost upon contact with anything. Once the final jet is destroyed, the game is over.

==Development and release==
The United States Court of Appeal states the following regarding the game&#x27;s development and release:

===Handheld versions===
A dedicated Tomytronic version of &quot;Scramble&quot; was released in 1982. A second electronic tabletop version of &quot;Scramble&quot; was released the same year in the UK by Grandstand under licence from Japanese firm Epoch Co., who sold the game in Japan under the title Astro Command. Gameplay differs from the arcade version as no scenery is rendered and the ship has no need to refuel. A handheld compact LCD version known as &quot;Pocket Scramble&quot; was released the following year. &quot;Scramble&quot; was also made available on the 2002 Game Boy Advance cartridge &quot;Konami Collector Series Arcade Advanced&quot;. This version is a close port of the original game in the arcade cabinet.

==Reception==
&quot;Scramble&quot; was commercially successful and critically acclaimed. In its February 1982 issue, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine said it &quot;was the first arcade game to send you on a mission and quickly earned a big following&quot;. In the United States, the game sold 10,000 arcade cabinets worth in sales within two months of release in 1981, and it topped the US monthly &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade charts in June 1981. It sold 15,136 arcade cabinets in the United States within five months, by August 4, 1981, becoming Stern&#x27;s second best-selling game after &quot;Berzerk&quot;. Its sequel, the more difficult &quot;Super Cobra&quot;, sold 12,337 cabinets in the U.S. in four months that same year, adding up to 27,473 U.S. cabinet sales for both, by October 1981. In Japan, &quot;Scramble&quot; was tied with &quot;Jump Bug&quot; and &quot;Space Panic&quot; as the 14th highest-grossing arcade video game of 1981.

The Vectrex version was reviewed in &quot;Video&quot; magazine where it was praised for its fidelity to the original arcade game and was described as the favorite among Vectrex titles they had reviewed. The game&#x27;s overlays were singled out, with reviewers commenting that &quot;when you&#x27;re really involved with a Vectrex game like &quot;Scramble&quot;, it&#x27;s almost possible to forget that the program is in black-and-white&quot;. David H. Ahl of &quot;Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games&quot; reported in 1983 that no test player was able to get past the fourth level of the Vectrex version.

In 1982, &quot;Arcade Express&quot; gave the Tomytronic version of the game a score of 9 out of 10, describing it as an &quot;engrossing&quot; game that &quot;rates as one of the year&#x27;s best so far&quot;.

&quot;Scramble&quot; made the list of Top 100 arcade games in the Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition. In 1996, GamesMaster ranked the arcade version 60th in their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; list.

==Legacy==
According to the Nintendo Game Boy Advance &quot;Gradius Advance&quot; intro and the &quot;Gradius Breakdown&quot; DVD included with &quot;Gradius V&quot;, &quot;Scramble&quot; is considered the first in the &quot;Gradius&quot; series, but the &quot;Gradius Collection&quot; guidebook issued a few years after by Konami, lists &quot;Scramble&quot; as part of their shooting history, and the &quot;Gradius&quot; games are now listed separately.

An updated version of &quot;Scramble&quot; is available in &quot;Konami Collector&#x27;s Series: Arcade Advanced&quot; by inputting the Konami Code in the game&#x27;s title screen. This version allows three different ships to be chosen: the Renegade, the Shori, and the Gunslinger. The only difference between the ships besides their appearance are the shots they fire. The Renegade&#x27;s shots are the same as in the original &quot;Scramble&quot;, the Shori has rapid-fire capabilities triggered by holding down the fire button, and the Gunslinger&#x27;s shots can pierce through enemies, meaning they can be used for multiple hits with a single shot.

===Impact===
In an interview with &quot;RePlay&quot; magazine in January 1990, Konami founder Kagemasa Kōzuki (Kaz Kozuki) stated that he considers &quot;Scramble&quot; to be Konami&#x27;s most important game. He said that &quot;Scramble&quot; was the company&#x27;s first major hit that launched Konami into world prominence. The game also served as a foundation for the horizontally scrolling shooter sub-genre. While not the first horizontally scrolling shooter (it was predated by &quot;Defender&quot; two months earlier), Wayne Santos of &quot;GameAxis Unwired&quot; notes that &quot;Scramble&quot; and its sequel &quot;Super Cobra&quot; &quot;created the side-scrolling shooter that progressed to the end of a level, rather than having a self-enclosed level that warped on itself in an infinite loop, like &quot;Defender&quot;&quot;.

Konami&#x27;s &quot;Gradius&quot; (1985), the first title in the &quot;Gradius&quot; series, was originally intended to be a follow-up to &quot;Scramble&quot;, with the working title &quot;Scramble 2&quot;. It reused many of its materials and game mechanics. Game designer Scott Rogers named &quot;Scramble&quot; as well as Irem&#x27;s &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; (1982) as forerunners of the endless runner platform genre.

===In other media===
&quot;Scramble&quot; gameplay is featured during the opening credits of the 1982 Spanish film &quot;Colegas&quot; by Eloy de la Iglesia, along with some other arcade games of the era like &quot;Defender&quot;, &quot;Monaco GP&quot; and &quot;Missile Command&quot;.

===Re-releases===
* &quot;Scramble&quot; joined the Xbox Live Arcade library for the Xbox 360 on September 13, 2006.
* &quot;Scramble&quot; was made available on Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Game Room&quot; service for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows on March 24, 2010.
* &quot;Scramble&quot; was re-released in 1999 for the PlayStation&quot; as part of &quot;Konami Arcade Classics&quot;
* &quot;Scramble&quot; was re-released in 2002 for the Game Boy Advance on the compilation &quot;Konami Collector&#x27;s Series: Arcade Advanced&quot;&quot;.

<text>5-MeO-DMT (5-methoxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine), also known as &quot;O&quot;-methylbufotenin or mebufotenin (), is a naturally occurring psychedelic of the tryptamine family. It is found in a wide variety of plant species, and is also secreted by the glands of at least one toad species, the Colorado River toad. It may occur naturally in humans as well. Like its close relatives dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and bufotenin (5-HO-DMT), it has been used as an entheogen in South America. Slang terms include &quot;five-methoxy&quot;, &quot;the power&quot;, &quot;bufo&quot;, and &quot;toad venom&quot;.

The drug acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors among others. However, 5-MeO-DMT differs from most other serotonergic psychedelics in having 100- to 1,000-fold higher affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor over the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. In relation to this, 5-MeO-DMT has been described as an &quot;atypical&quot; psychedelic and as producing subjective effects notably distinct from those of DMT and other psychedelics, for instance having a relative lack of visual effects. Like DMT, 5-MeO-DMT has a very rapid onset of action and short duration. However, 5-MeO-DMT is 4- to 10-fold more potent than DMT in humans.

5-MeO-DMT was first synthesized in 1936 by Toshio Hoshino (ja), professor of Tokyo Institute of Technology, and was first isolated from a natural source in 1959. It is a controlled substance in some countries, for instance the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. The drug is used recreationally and several deaths have been reported in association with its use. 5-MeO-DMT is being developed for potential use in medicine in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression.

==Chemistry==
5-MeO-DMT, also known as 5-methoxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine, is a substituted tryptamine derivative. It is the 5-methoxylated derivative of &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), the &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylated derivative of 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT; mexamine), and the &quot;O&quot;-methylated derivative of bufotenin (5-HO-DMT).

It has a relatively high experimental log P of 3.30.

Analogues of 5-MeO-DMT include 4-MeO-DMT, 5-MeO-AMT, 5-MeO-DET, 5-MeO-DPT, 5-MeO-DIPT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-EtO-DMT, and 5-MeO-MET. Other analogues include dimemebfe and EMDT.

==Effects==
When smoked, the duration of the effects of 5-MeO-DMT can be as little as ten minutes; when insufflated, up to two hours, although the peak effects are usually in the range of 10–40 minutes. Effects vary and can range from radical perspective shifting and perception of new insights, euphoria, immersive experiences, dissociation and non-responsiveness, sensual/erotic enhancement, to dysphoria, fear, terror, panic, and ego death.

The subjective effects of 5-MeO-DMT are described as distinct from those of DMT and other psychedelics. Whereas DMT is described as producing more &quot;information-rich&quot; experiences, with &quot;rich sensory phenomenology&quot;, visuals, and experiences of encountering entities and visiting other worlds, 5-MeO-DMT is described as having a relative lack of visual effects, producing a sense of &quot;nothingness&quot;, and causing experiences that are said to be &quot;content-free&quot; and sometimes known as &quot;whiteouts&quot;. These experiences have been described as &quot;beyond ordinary human comprehension&quot;, with a subjective impression of a void or amnesia of the experience. In spite of this however, some have described the experiences as orgasmic, ecstatic, and blissful, whereas others have described them as terror or &quot;information overwhelm&quot;. As with DMT and other psychedelics, the experiences with 5-MeO-DMT are often described as overwhelming, profound, spiritual, religious, and/or mystical.

The experiences of 5-MeO-DMT have been related to the experience of ecstatic seizures.

==Uses==
Preliminary clinical findings suggest that 5-MeO-DMT might have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects.

===Religious use===
The Church of the Tree of Life, founded in California in 1971 by John Mann but now defunct, declared the use of 5-MeO-DMT to be a sacrament. From approximately 1971 to the late 1980s, 5-MeO-DMT was discreetly available to its members. Between 1970 and 1990, smoking of 5-MeO-DMT on parsley was probably one of the two most common forms of ingestion in the United States.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
5-MeO-DMT is a methoxylated derivative of dimethyltryptamine (DMT). While most common psychedelics are believed to primarily elicit psychological effects through agonism of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, 5-MeO-DMT shows 1,000-fold greater affinity for 5-HT1A over 5-HT2A; In line with its affinity for 5-HT1A receptors, 5-MeO-DMT is extremely potent at suppressing the firing of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons. Further, its activity in rats was attenuated with the 5-HT1A selective antagonist WAY-100635 while 5-HT2A selective antagonist volinanserin failed to demonstrate any change. Additional mechanisms of action such as inhibition of monoamine reuptake may be involved. A 2019 European study with 42 volunteers showed that a single inhalation produced sustained enhancement of satisfaction with life, and easing of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A 2018 study demonstrated that a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT induced neurogenesis in mice.

Similarly to other serotonergic psychedelics, 5-MeO-DMT is a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors, among others. It is 4- to 10-fold more potent as a hallucinogen than DMT in humans. In contrast to most serotonergic psychedelics however, it has been said that it is unclear that the hallucinogenic effects of 5-MeO-DMT are principally mediated by activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. In any case, 5-MeO-DMT does still activate the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and does still produce psychedelic effects. It has been proposed that 5-MeO-DMT be considered an &quot;atypical&quot; psychedelic. This relates to the fact that 5-MeO-DMT has 100- to 1,000-fold selectivity for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor over the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and that the actions of 5-MeO-DMT appear to be primarily mediated by serotonin 5-HT1A receptor activation. For example, the potencies of drugs substituting for 5-MeO-DMT in drug discrimination assays is well-correlated with their serotonin 5-HT1A receptor affinities, and the discriminative stimulus effects of 5-MeO-DMT are attenuated by serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonists. However, there is partial generalization of 5-MeO-DMT to the selective serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist (–)-DOM in animals. In accordance with the preceding findings, 5-MeO-DMT is reported to produce notably distinct subjective effects compared DMT and other psychedelics in humans.

Although 5-MeO-DMT shows dramatically higher affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor than for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, the situation appears to be very different in terms of its actual activational potencies at these receptors. Its values have been found to be 1.80 to 3.87nM at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and 3.92 to 1,060nM at the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor. For comparison, the values of DMT were found to be 38.3nM at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and &gt;10,000nM at the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor in one of the same studies. Hence, 5-MeO-DMT appears to be similarly potent or as much as 200-fold more potent as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor than of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor. In addition, 5-MeO-DMT is 10-fold more potent than DMT as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.

Besides the serotonin receptors, 5-MeO-DMT is an agonist of the melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors. Unlike DMT, 5-MeO-DMT is not a ligand or agonist of the sigma receptors. In contrast to certain other tryptamines, 5-MeO-DMT is inactive as a monoamine releasing agent, including of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. However, it is a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor, with an value of 2,184nM. Conversely, it is inactive as a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( = &gt;10,000nM).

Similarly to DMT, but in contrast to most other psychedelics, like LSD and psilocybin, there appears to be very little development of tolerance with 5-MeO-DMT. In fact, there may even be sensitization to the effects of 5-MeO-DMT. The lack of tolerance development with 5-MeO-DMT may be due to biased agonism of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. More specifically, 5-MeO-DMT activates the Gq signaling pathway of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor with much less potency in recruiting β-arrestin2. Activation of β-arrestin2 is linked to receptor downregulation and tachyphylaxis.

===Pharmacokinetics===
5-MeO-DMT is lipophilic and is thought to easily cross the blood–brain barrier. Accordingly, 5-MeO-DMT readily accumulates in the brain in animals with levels higher than in blood. This is in notable contrast to bufotenin (5-HO-DMT or &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylserotonin) and serotonin (5-HT), which are hydrophilic and peripherally selective.

Bufotenin is an active metabolite of 5-MeO-DMT, formed by &quot;O&quot;-demethylation by cytochrome P450 CYP2D6. Bufotenin notably has much higher affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor than 5-MeO-DMT itself. However, bufotenin does not seem to be extensively produced from 5-MeO-DMT in the brain. In addition, peripherally formed bufotenin may not be able to exert significant central effects due to its limited ability to cross into the brain. Hence, the involvement of bufotenin in the psychoactive effects of 5-MeO-DMT is uncertain.

The metabolism of 5-MeO-DMT can be dramatically reduced and its levels markedly augmented and prolonged by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). In addition, MAOIs allow 5-MeO-DMT to become orally active in humans. Combination of 5-MeO-DMT with MAOIs has sometimes resulted in serotonin syndrome and death in humans.

==Sources==
In addition to naturally-occurring sources, 5-MeO-DMT can be produced synthetically.

The Colorado River toad is a noted animal source of 5-MeO-DMT. First described in 1983 by Ken Nelson (writing under the pseudonym of Albert Most), smoking the parotoid secretions of the animal produces a powerful and short-lived psychedelic experience. The smoking of &quot;I. alvarius&quot; secretions should not be confused with the urban legend of toad licking. Since 1983, the animal has since became a popular source of 5-MeO-DMT for recreational or spiritual purposes. Unfortunately, this increased demand and use of the toads as a source of 5-MeO-DMT has put strain on their populations. Concerned with the ecological impacts of the growing use of &quot;I. alvarius&quot; secretions as a source of 5-MeO-DMT, Ken Nelson would later advocate for the use of synthetic 5-MeO-DMT and conservation of the Colorado River Toad.

The Swedish government classified 5-MeO-DMT, listed as 5-metoxi-N,N-dimetyltryptamin (5-MeO-DMT) in their regulation SFS 2004:696, as &quot;health hazard&quot; under the in October 2004, making it illegal to sell or possess.

===Turkey===
5-MeO-DMT has been controlled in Turkey since December 2013.

===United States===
5-MeO-DMT was made a Schedule I controlled substance in January 2011.

==Research==
5-MeO-DMT is being developed and evaluated for potential therapeutic effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Biopharmaceutical company GH Research has sponsored a completed phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and phase 1/2 study in TRD patients where 87.5% of patients with TRD were brought into remission on day 7 in the phase 2 part of the study. GH Research is currently planning a phase 2b study in TRD patients and have received approval for studies in patients with bipolar II disorder and a current depressive episode and patients with postpartum depression.

In February 2025, GH Research announced that their Phase 2b clinical trial of GH001, met its primary endpoint in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The trial demonstrated a placebo-adjusted reduction of 15.5 points on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at day 8, with 57.7% of patients achieving remission compared to 0% in the placebo group. The trial also met all secondary endpoints, and the treatment was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported.

Beckley Psytech in collaboration with King&#x27;s College London is evaluating the safety and tolerability of intranasal 5-MeO-DMT in healthy subjects, in a phase 1 study. Beckley Psytech CEO Cosmo Feilding-Mellen sees a potential in the short-acting nature of 5-MeO-DMT compared to psilocybin: &quot;Requiring one or two therapists to sit in a room with a single patient for the entire duration of an MDMA or psilocybin experience, which is essentially a whole working day, is probably going to be very resource-intensive and expensive. There is already a global shortage of psychotherapists, and this poses a potential bottleneck to patient access in the future.&quot;

<doc id="464573" wikidata="Q1703930" url="?curid=464573" title="Sidney W. Pink">
<text>Sidney W. Pink (1916-2002) was an American film producer and occasional director. He has been called the father of feature-length 3-D movies. He is also noted for producing early Spaghetti Westerns and low-budget science-fiction films, and for his role in actor Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s transition from stage to screen. 

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1916, Pink died in 2002 at his home in Pompano Beach, Florida, following a long illness.

==Early life and education==
Pink was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1916, the second of Philip and Rose (née Ehrenworth) Pink&#x27;s two sons. After playing the film producer in his high school&#x27;s production of &quot;Merton of the Movies&quot;, he realized this was the profession he would ultimately pursue, calling it his life&#x27;s ambition. Pink earned a degree in business administration from the University of Pittsburgh.

==Film career==
Pink first worked as a projectionist in a movie theater owned by his wife&#x27;s family and worked for years building and managing theatres. Sometimes he presented stage shows in cinemas.

In 1937, Pink moved to Hollywood and was hired by Grand National Pictures as production budget manager for the Tex Ritter singing cowboy series. Pink then moved to Columbia Pictures as a budget manager on &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; and the Jack Holt action films. At that time, &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; had a budget of $1.25 million for the film, the largest amount ever allocated to a project at that time.

===World War II and after career===
During World War II, he served in the Army Transportation Corps and Special Services. After the war, he imported foreign films and produced burlesque shows in downtown Los Angeles with Lili St. Cyr, Joe DeRita and other performers.

===3-D film pioneer===
In 1952, Pink served as associate producer with Arch Oboler, the producer, writer and director of &quot;Bwana Devil&quot;. The feature-length color film was the first widely-shown 3-D film to use the polarized 3-D method rather than the red-and-blue-glasses anaglyph 3-D occasionally used for short films. It was made using the &quot;Natural Vision&quot; system, which employed two separate but interlocked cameras and required two specially modified projectors. The film premiered in late November and started a brief but intense 3-D fad that peaked in mid-1953, faltered in the fall, rallied, then faded away almost completely during 1954.

===&quot;Bwana Devil&quot;===
&quot;Bwana Devil&quot; star Robert Stack said he was proud to have starred in Pink&#x27;s pioneer 3-D production, shot in Hollywood with two large cameras using polarized lenses, one for the left eye and one for the right. Stack said “There was a line 6 feet from both cameras which you were not supposed to cross, otherwise, you’d wind up with that portion of your anatomy projected over the first 10 rows of the audience”. Stack said no one involved with the film knew how audiences would react to the 3-D technique. “Sidney Pink and Arch Oboler and all of us poor innocents were involved in something that we didn’t even know worked or not,” Stack said. “It was a very expensive process, and it took a lot of guts to even do it”. Stack recalled that everyone had their fingers crossed at the first preview. “Over the titles, they had a train that made a long, circling turn and then came directly to the camera. Well, when it came directly to the camera, people began to scream and jumped out of their seats and ran out of the theater. I remember one of the guys saying, ‘Son of a [gun], it really works.’” Stack said “Bwana Devil” was “enough of an eye catcher” to prompt Jack Warner to come out with his own 3-D production at Warner Bros. in 1953, “The House of Wax,” starring Vincent Price. “He (Warner) felt this was the coming thing,” said Stack. “Of course, he was not exactly a rocket scientist, and it wasn’t the coming thing”.

In 1989, Pink spoke fondly, recalling the opening week, starting November 30, 1952 of &quot;Bwana Devil&quot; at the Hollywood Paramount Theater. &quot;They were lined up around the block&quot;. &quot;People would come out of the movie and yell, &#x27;Don&#x27;t go in, it stinks!&#x27; But nobody listened and they went in anyway&quot;.

===CineMagic process===
In 1959, Pink produced &quot;The Angry Red Planet&quot;, using a new film processing technique he named CineMagic to create an unreal, otherworldly &quot;Martian&quot; effect in some sequences.

===Foreign productions===
In 1959, Pink moved his operation to Denmark. Pink&#x27;s wife Marian Pink, in a newspaper interview, said &quot;At the time it was very difficult to work in any of the [Hollywood] studios because they had union problems and would not accept an independent producer... at that time, they were called ‘the runaway producers&quot;.

In 1960, Pink wrote, directed and produced &quot;The Greeneyed Elephant&quot; for Saga Studios in Denmark. He also co-produced and co-directed the American version of Saga Studios&#x27; &quot;Reptilicus&quot;, a &quot;giant-monster-on-the-loose&quot; film. Pink also wrote, directed and produced &quot;Gateway Gaza&quot;, filmed in Cairo, Egypt. All three films were released by American International Pictures.

===Praised Danish animators===
Pink returned to Hollywood praising Danish animation, saying &quot;Danish miniature work has surpassed that of Japan, up to generally acknowledged to be the finest in the world. Facilities in Denmark, by Hollywood standards, are notably lacking; but fine craftsmen who put everything together by hand are not concerned with the time it takes, (and) are excellent&quot;. Pink also said &quot;the Scandinavian countries have never truly been exploited by Hollywood filmmakers, so the settings have remained unusually fresh ground for motion pictures. &quot;Reptilicus&quot; at Saga Studios in Copenhagen made “at a cost of $380,000 (), about a third of what it probably would have cost if made in the U. S.&quot;.

===Later films===
In 1964, Pink turned down an offer to produce A Fistful of Dollars. Pink said &quot;And can you believe it, I turned down the offer to produce A Fistful of Dollars in Spain with Clint Eastwood? That was not one of my better decisions&quot;.

In 1965, Pink co-wrote and directed a spaghetti western &quot;Finger on the Trigger&quot; (also known as &quot;Blue Lightning&quot;), starring Rory Calhoun. The movie was filmed in Spain. Victor Mature was set to be the movie&#x27;s star, but he didn&#x27;t fulfill his contract and did not appear. Pink later sued Mature for $1.1 million dollars.

In 1966, Pink discovered Dustin Hoffman in an off-Broadway stage production in New York City and cast him in &quot;Madigan&#x27;s Millions&quot; as a U.S. Treasury agent sent to Italy to recover money that had been stolen by a murdered gangster played by Cesar Romero. The movie was filmed in Italy and Spain and not released until 1969, two years after Hoffman achieved stardom with his role in the 1967 film &quot;The Graduate&quot;. All told, Pink produced a total of more than 50 films.

===Movie theatre owner===
In the early 1970s, Pink built and owned movie theaters in the southeastern United States, including the Bainbridge Triple Cinemas (now the closed Bainbridge Mall Cinemas) in Bainbridge, Georgia, as well as theatres in Puerto Rico and Florida.

==Death ==
Pink died in 2002 at his home in Pompano Beach, Florida, following a long illness.

<text>Metromedia, Inc. (also often MetroMedia) was an American media company that owned radio and television stations in the United States from 1956 to 1986 and controlled Orion Pictures from 1988 to 1997. Metromedia was established in 1956 after the DuMont Television Network ceased operations and its owned-and-operated stations were spun off into a separate company. Metromedia sold its television stations to News Corporation in 1985 (which News Corp. then used to form the nucleus of Fox Television Stations), and spun off its radio stations into a separate company in 1986. Metromedia then acquired ownership stakes in various film studios, including controlling ownership in Orion. In 1997, Metromedia closed down and sold its media assets to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

==History==
===Origins===
The company arose from the ashes of the DuMont Television Network, the world&#x27;s first commercial television network. DuMont had been in economic trouble throughout its existence, and was seriously undermined when ABC accepted a buyout offer from United Paramount Theaters in 1953. The ABC-UPT deal gave ABC the resources to operate a national television service along the lines of CBS and NBC. DuMont officials quickly realized the ABC-UPT deal put their network on life support, and agreed in principle to merge with ABC. However, it was forced to back out of the deal when minority owner Paramount Pictures raised antitrust concerns. UPT had only spun off from Paramount four years earlier, and there were still doubts about whether the two companies were really separate.

By 1955, DuMont realized it could not compete against the other three networks and decided to wind down its operations. Soon after DuMont formally shut down network service in 1956, the parent firm DuMont Laboratories spun off the network&#x27;s two remaining owned and operated stations, WABD in New York City and WTTG in Washington, D.C., to shareholders as the DuMont Broadcasting Corporation. The company&#x27;s headquarters were co-located with WABD in the former DuMont Tele-Centre (which was later renamed the Metromedia Telecenter) in New York.

In 1957, DuMont Broadcasting purchased two New York area radio stations, WNEW (now WBBR) and WHFI (later WNEW-FM and WWFS), and later that year changed its name to the Metropolitan Broadcasting Corporation to distance itself from its former parent company. The following year, Paramount sold its shares in Metropolitan Broadcasting to Washington-based investor John Kluge, enough to give Kluge controlling interest. Kluge installed himself as chairman, and later increased his holdings to 75 percent. WABD&#x27;s call letters were later changed to WNEW-TV to match its new radio sisters.

===Expansion===

Metropolitan Broadcasting&#x27;s first acquisitions included WHK-AM-FM in Cleveland (in 1958); the Foster &amp; Kleiser outdoor advertising firm (in 1959); and KOVR in Stockton, California, Benedict Gimbel Jr.-owned WIP-AM-FM in Philadelphia, WTVH-TV (now WHOI) in Peoria, Illinois, and WTVP television (now WAND) in Decatur, Illinois (all in 1960). In 1961 Metropolitan purchased KMBC-AM-TV in Kansas City, Missouri. Later that year the company&#x27;s name was changed to Metromedia; the Metropolitan Broadcasting name was retained for its broadcasting division until 1967.

In separate 1963 deals the company expanded into Los Angeles, buying first KTTV and later KLAC and the original KLAC-FM (now KIIS-FM). The company would later engineer a swap of FM facilities; the second KLAC-FM (later KMET and now KTWV) was established in 1965. Metromedia also entered the realm of live entertainment by purchasing the Ice Capades (in 1963) and the Harlem Globetrotters (in 1967). Later in the decade Metromedia opened a television production center in Los Angeles, known as Metromedia Square, which served as the studio facility for numerous network programs. Metromedia also owned a TV production and distribution company called Metromedia Producers Corporation (MPC), established in 1968 from Wolper Productions. MPC produced and syndicated various programs and TV movies, most notably the game show &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; and the 1972-86 version of &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;. Metromedia spent the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s increasing its television and radio station portfolio, and continued to expand its syndication business. In 1976, it teamed up with MTM Enterprises to launch a first-run syndicated variety show.

Metromedia entered the record business in 1969 with the launch of the Metromedia Records label, whose biggest-selling artist was Bobby Sherman. The label was also notable as having issued the first two studio albums of Peter Allen, &quot;Peter Allen&quot; (1971) and &quot;Tenterfield Saddler&quot; (1972). The label was closed in 1974. Allen&#x27;s &quot;Tenterfield Saddler&quot;, the title song of which has become an Australian standard, was acquired and reissued by A&amp;M Records in 1978.

In 1976, similar to the more successful SFM Holiday Network of syndicated stations launched two years later, Metromedia teamed up with Ogilvy and Mather for a proposed linking of independent TV stations termed &quot;MetroNet&quot;. The proposed programming would consist of several Sunday night family dramas, on weeknights a half-hour serial and a gothic series similar to &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, and on Saturdays a variety program hosted by Charo. The plans for MetroNet failed when advertisers balked at Metromedia&#x27;s advertising rate, which was only slightly lower than the Big Three&#x27;s and low national coverage, leaving for another similar operation, Operation Prime Time. In 1979, Metromedia Producers Corporation had also reached a deal with Bob Stewart Productions for an exclusive co-producing agreement.

In 1982, Metromedia made its biggest broadcasting purchase when it acquired WCVB-TV in Boston for $220 million, which at the time was the largest amount ever spent on a single television station property. Two years later, John Kluge bought out Metromedia&#x27;s shareholders and took the company private.

Also around this time, Metromedia attempted to bring to the air a national newscast for independent stations (much as the rival Tribune Company had created &quot;Independent Network News&quot; in 1980), planned for launch in the fall of 1983. Unlike &quot;INN&quot;, the program was planned to be offered as a hybrid, hour-long local/national newscast, fed to affiliates by satellite as a headlines block and three other segments, which could be aired by local stations in whatever order the stations deemed alongside locally produced news content. Also as part of this plan, Metromedia established full news departments for KRIV in Houston and what was then KRLD-TV in Dallas (another news department was planned for WFLD in Chicago, but that department ultimately didn&#x27;t launch until 1987, after the Murdoch buyout). Metromedia attempted to hire Charles Kuralt away from CBS News to serve as anchor. Kuralt chose to stay to with CBS; John Hart was also considered as an anchor, but ultimately the planned newscast never came to fruition.

In 1985, it made an attempt to revive the comedy &quot;Oh, Madeline&quot; as &quot;The Madeline Kahn Show&quot; for first-run syndication, but the deal never came to fruition.

===1985-86 divestitures===
On May 4, 1985, Kluge announced the sale of Metromedia&#x27;s television stations, and Metromedia Producers Corp., to News Corporation (owned by Australian newspaper publisher Rupert Murdoch) and 20th Century Fox Film Corporation (owned jointly by Murdoch and Marvin Davis) for $3.5 billion. With the exception of WCVB-TV (which was subsequently sold to the Hearst Corporation), all of the former Metromedia stations formed the nucleus of the Fox Broadcasting Company (which began operations on October 9, 1986), while MPC was folded into 20th Century Fox Television. The transactions became official on March 6, 1986. Because of these transactions, and the fact that Metromedia was originally spun off from the DuMont Television Network, radio personality Clarke Ingram has suggested that the Fox network is a revival or at least a linear descendant of DuMont.

Kluge also sold Metromedia&#x27;s outdoor advertising firm, the Harlem Globetrotters, and the Ice Capades in 1985, its cellular phone and yellow pages divisions to the Southwestern Bell Corporation (now known as the second incarnation of AT&amp;T, due to SBC&#x27;s acquisition of AT&amp;T Corporation in 2005) under the leadership of Zane Barnes, Robert G. Pope, and J.B. Ellis. They also spun off the radio stations into a separate company (which took on the Metropolitan Broadcasting name) before they were sold to various other owners by the early 1990s.

===Legal battles===
In retaliation for a lawsuit brought by Paul Winchell, who sought the rights to his children&#x27;s television program &quot;Winchell-Mahoney Time&quot;, which was produced at KTTV in Los Angeles during the mid-1960s, it is believed that KTTV management destroyed the program&#x27;s video tapes. In 1989 Winchell was awarded nearly $18 million as compensation for Metromedia&#x27;s capricious behavior.

In 1983, Christine Craft, a former evening news co-anchor at KMBC-TV in Kansas City, sued Metromedia on claims of fraud and sexual discrimination. After spending eight months at KMBC-TV in 1981, she was demoted to reporting assignment after a focus group study claimed Craft was &quot;too old, too unattractive and not deferential to men&quot; in the eyes of viewers. Craft declined the reassignment and subsequently resigned from the station. Craft initially won her case, though she lost on appeal at the U.S. Supreme Court.

===Ownership of film studios===
On May 22, 1986, Metromedia acquired a 6.5% stake in Orion Pictures Corporation; a movie and television production studio. By December, the stake in Orion&#x27;s ownership was increased from 9.3% to 12.6% and on April 12, 1988, to 44.1% On May 20, 1988, Metromedia acquired Sumner Redstone&#x27;s share for $78 million, holding a majority stake in Orion Pictures worth nearly 67%. In 1995, Kluge merged Orion, MCEG Sterling Entertainment (producer of the &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; series), the holding company Actava, and Metromedia into a new Metromedia International Group. In November 1995, Metromedia announced that it would acquire Motion Picture Corporation of America (MPCA) for $32 million, followed by The Samuel Goldwyn Company for $115 million in February 1996. On April 11, 1997, Metromedia sold Orion/Goldwyn and MPCA to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) for $573 million and was closed on July 10 of the same year. In 1998, MPCA broke apart from MGM becoming independent again.

===Activities following film sale===
Following the sale of the film business to MGM, Metromedia still owned Metromedia Restaurant Group (which it had renamed from S&amp;A Restaurant Group, which was acquired from Grand Metropolitan) in 1990 as well as Metromedia Fiber Network. The latter went bankrupt a few years later and became AboveNet, while the former went bankrupt in 2008. Metromedia International operated subscription television operators (Kosmos-TV, Alma TV, Ala TV, Kamalak TV) and private radio stations in Eastern Europe and CIS countries; by 2006 following the sale of most assets, it bought Magticom in Georgia to ease financial burden from filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Most assets were joint-ventures with government-linked companies. Its Kazakh operations were put in a state of limbo in 2002 due to regulatory issues.

==Typeface==
Beginning in 1967, Metromedia&#x27;s television stations began utilizing a sans-serif typeface for their on-air logo. The typeface was a proprietary one called &quot;Metromedia Television Alphabet&quot;, which was as distinctive as the typeface employed by Group W unit of Westinghouse Electric for its TV and radio stations beginning in 1963. &quot;Metromedia Television Alphabet&quot; was used for the channel numbers of its television stations until 1977, when another typeface modeled slightly after the Futura family was introduced.

<text>Edith Claire Head (née Posenor, October 28, 1897 – October 24, 1981) was an American film costume designer who won a record eight Academy Awards for Best Costume Design between 1949 and 1973, making her the most awarded woman in the Academy&#x27;s history. Head is considered to be one of the greatest and most influential costume designers in film history.

Born and raised in California, Head started her career as a Spanish teacher, but was interested in design. After studying at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles, Head was hired as a costume sketch artist at Paramount Pictures in 1923. She won acclaim for her design of Dorothy Lamour’s trademark sarong in the 1936 film &quot;The Jungle Princess&quot;, and became a household name after the Academy Award for Best Costume Design was created in 1948. Head was considered exceptional for her close working relationships with her subjects, with whom she consulted extensively; these included virtually every top female star in Hollywood.

Head worked at Paramount for 44 years. In 1967, the company declined to renew her contract, and she was invited by Alfred Hitchcock to join Universal Pictures. There she earned her eighth and final Academy Award for her work on &quot;The Sting&quot; in 1973.

==Early life and career==
She was born Edith Claire Posener in San Bernardino, California, the daughter of Jewish parents, Max Posener and Anna E. Levy. Her father, born in January 1858, was a naturalized American citizen from Germany, who came to the United States in 1876. Her mother was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1875, the daughter of an Austrian father and a Bavarian mother. Max and Anna married in 1895, according to the 1900 United States Federal Census records. Just before Edith&#x27;s birth, Max Posener opened a small haberdashery in San Bernardino, which failed within a year.

The marriage did not survive. In 1905, Anna remarried, this time to mining engineer Frank Spare, originally from Pennsylvania. The family moved frequently as Spare&#x27;s jobs moved. The only place Head could later recall living during her early years was Searchlight, Nevada. Frank and Anna Spare passed Edith off as their child. As Frank Spare was a Catholic, Edith ostensibly became one as well.

In 1919, Edith received a Bachelor of Arts degree in letters and sciences with honors in French from the University of California, Berkeley, and in 1920 earned a Master of Arts degree in romance languages from Stanford University.

She became a language teacher with her first position as a replacement at The Bishop&#x27;s School in La Jolla teaching French. After one year, she took a position teaching Spanish at the Hollywood School for Girls. Wanting a slightly higher salary, she told the school that she could also teach art, even though she had only briefly studied the discipline in high school. To improve her drawing skills, at this point rudimentary, she took evening classes at the Otis Art Institute and Chouinard Art College.

On July 25, 1923, she married Charles Head, the brother of one of her Chouinard classmates, Betty Head. Although the marriage ended in divorce in 1938 after a number of years of separation, she continued to be known professionally as Edith Head until her death. In 1940 she married award-winning art director Wiard Ihnen, a marriage which lasted until his death in 1979.

==The Paramount years==

In 1924, despite lacking art, design, and costume design experience, the 26-year-old Head was hired as a costume sketch artist at Paramount Pictures. Later she admitted to &quot;borrowing&quot; other students&#x27; sketches for her job interview. She began designing costumes for silent films, commencing with &quot;The Wanderer&quot; in 1925 and, by the 1930s, had established herself as one of Hollywood&#x27;s leading costume designers. She worked at Paramount for 43 years until she went to Universal Pictures on March 27, 1967, possibly prompted by her extensive work for director Alfred Hitchcock, who had moved to Universal in 1960.

Head&#x27;s marriage to set designer Wiard Ihnen, on September 8, 1940, lasted until his death from prostate cancer in 1979. Over the course of her long career, she was nominated for 35 Academy Awards, annually from 1949 (the first year that the Oscar for Best Costume Design was awarded) through 1966, and won eight times – receiving more Oscars than any other woman.

Although Head was featured in studio publicity from the mid-1920s, she was originally overshadowed by Paramount&#x27;s lead designers, first Howard Greer, then Travis Banton. Head was instrumental in conspiring against Banton, and after his resignation in 1938 she became a high-profile designer in her own right. Her association with the &quot;sarong&quot; dress designed for Dorothy Lamour in &quot;The Hurricane&quot; (1937) made her well known among the general public, although Head was a more restrained designer than either Banton or Adrian. She gained public attention for the top mink-lined gown she created for Ginger Rogers in &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; (1944), which caused much comment owing to the mood of wartime austerity. The establishment, in 1949, of the Academy Award for Costume Design further boosted her career, giving her a record-breaking run of Award nominations and wins, beginning with her nomination for &quot;The Emperor Waltz&quot;. Head and other film designers like Adrian became well known to the public.

Head was known for her unique working style and, unlike many of her male contemporaries, usually consulted extensively with the female stars with whom she worked. As a result, she was a favorite among many of the leading female stars of the 1940s and 1950s, such as Ginger Rogers, Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Jane Wyman, Rita Hayworth, Shirley MacLaine, Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn, and Elizabeth Taylor. In fact, Head was frequently &quot;loaned out&quot; by Paramount to other studios at the request of their female stars. She herself always dressed very plainly, preferring thick-framed glasses and conservative two-piece suits.

In 1946, Head worked for the first time with director Alfred Hitchcock. They worked together on his spy film &quot;Notorious.&quot; Head, who worked for Paramount, was loaned to Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) pictures to work with Hitchcock on this film. In this time period it was more often found that costume designers would design to reflect their own style. Head had a different outlook on this. She felt that it was more important to design pieces that reflected the character. During their time working on this movie, Head and Hitchcock found that they were like-minded and had the same bluntness in their careers and attitudes. The costumes she designed for this film reflected restraint and the need to blend in. This style suited what Hitchcock was looking for since he did not want the clothes to be the focal point. The two would go on to work together many more times.

On February 3, 1955 (Season 5 Episode 21), Edith Head appeared as a contestant on the Groucho Marx quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;. She and her partner won a total of $1,540. Her winnings were donated to charity.

Head also authored two books describing her career and design philosophy, &quot;The Dress Doctor&quot; (1959) and &quot;How To Dress For Success&quot; (1967). These books were re-edited in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

==The Universal years==
In 1967, at the age of 70, she left Paramount Pictures and joined Universal Pictures, where she remained until her death in 1981. By this point, Hollywood was rapidly changing from what it had been during Head&#x27;s heyday in the 1930s-1940s. Studio-based production was giving way to outdoors and on-scene shooting, and many of the actresses from that era whom she worked with and knew intimately had retired or were working less. She thus turned more of her attention to TV, where some old friends such as Olivia de Havilland had begun working. She designed Endora&#x27;s clothing on &quot;Bewitched&quot;, and made a cameo appearance in 1973 on the detective series &quot;Columbo&quot; beside Anne Baxter, playing herself and displaying her Oscars to date. In 1974, Head received a final Oscar win for her work on &quot;The Sting&quot;.

In the late 1970s Edith Head was asked to design a woman&#x27;s uniform for the United States Coast Guard, because of the increasing number of women in the Coast Guard. Head called the assignment a highlight in her career and received the Meritorious Public Service Award for her efforts. Her designs for a TV mini-series based on the novel &quot;Little Women&quot; were well received. Her last film project was the black-and-white comedy &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid&quot; (1982), starring Steve Martin and Carl Reiner, a job Head was chosen for because of her expertise on 1940s fashions. She modeled Martin and Reiner&#x27;s outfits on classic film noir and the movie, released in theaters just after her death, was dedicated to her memory.

==Death==
Head died on October 24, 1981, four days before her 84th birthday, from myelofibrosis, an incurable bone marrow disease. She is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

==Hollywood Walk of Fame==
Edith Head&#x27;s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which she received in 1974, is located at 6504 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>The Asian woolly-necked stork or Asian woollyneck (Ciconia episcopus) is a species of large wading bird in the stork family Ciconiidae. It breeds singly, or in small loose colonies. It is distributed in a wide variety of habitats including marshes in forests, agricultural areas, and freshwater wetlands across Asia.

==Taxonomy==
The woolly-necked stork was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; from a specimen collected from the Coromandel Coast of India. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Ardea episcopus&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The woolly-necked stork is now placed in the genus &quot;Ciconia&quot; that was erected by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The genus name &quot;Ciconia&quot; is the Latin word for a &quot;stork&quot;; the specific epithet &quot;episcopus&quot; is Latin for &quot;bishop&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. e. episcopus&quot; (Boddaert, 1783) – India to Indochina, the Philippines and Malay Peninsula, north Sumatra
* &quot;C. e. neglecta&quot; (Finsch, 1904) – south Sumatra, Java, Lesser Sunda Islands, Sulawesi

The online edition of the &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; , the IOC, Clements, and the IUCN have reclassified the African race, &quot;C. e. microscelis&quot;, as a separate species, the African woolly-necked stork (&quot;C. microscelis&quot;), with the remaining two subspecies becoming the Asian woolly-necked stork. The &quot;Handbook&quot; and other sources of taxonomic lists use geographical separation as the sole basis for elevating the three subspecies into two species, and this assumption requires to be tested using more definitive methods such as genetics.

== Description ==
The woolly-necked stork is a medium-sized stork at 75–92 cm tall. The iris is deep crimson or wine-red. The stork is glistening black overall with a black &quot;skull cap&quot;, a downy white neck which gives it its name. The lower belly and under-tail coverts are white, standing out from the rest of the dark coloured plumage. Feathers on the fore-neck are iridescent with a coppery-purple tinge. These feathers are elongated and can be erected during displays. The tail is deeply forked and is white, usually covered by the black long under tail coverts. It has long red legs and a heavy, blackish bill, though some specimens have largely dark-red bills with only the basal one-third being black. Sexes are alike. Juvenile birds are duller versions of the adult with a feathered forehead that is sometimes streaked black-and-white. The African birds are described as having the edges of the black cap diffused or with a jagged border compared to a sharp and clean border in the Asian birds. Sexes are identical, though males are thought to be larger. When the wings are opened either during displays or for flight, a narrow band of very bright unfeathered skin is visible along the underside of the forearm. This band has been variously described as being &quot;neon, orange-red&quot;, &quot;like a red-gold jewel&quot;, and &quot;almost glowing&quot; when seen at close range.

Small nestlings are pale grey with buffy down on the neck, and a black crown. At fledging age, the immature bird is identical to the adult except for a feathered forehead, much lesser iridescence on feathers, and much longer and fluffier feathers on the neck. Newly fledged young have a prominent white mark in the center of the forehead that can be used to distinguish young of the year.

English common names for this species include the white-necked stork, white-headed stork, bishop stork and parson-bird. More recently, the African and Asian populations are considered to be two different species, the African woolly-necked stork and the Asian woolly-necked stork. This is based purely on geographical isolation, but there is no morphological or phylogenetic evidence yet to support this split.


== Distribution and habitat ==

It is a widespread tropical species which breeds in Asia, from India to Indonesia. It is a resident breeder building nests on trees located on agricultural fields or wetlands, on natural cliffs, and on cell phone towers. They use a variety of freshwater wetlands including seasonal and perennial reservoirs and marshes, crop lands, irrigation canals and rivers, but are mostly seen in agricultural areas and in wetlands outside protected areas across south Asia and Myanmar. They are attracted to fires in grasslands and crop fields where they capture insects trying to escape the fire. They use ponds and marshes inside forests in Asia, especially in south-east Asia where they use grassy and marshy areas in clearings in several forest types. In India, they are an uncommon species in coastal habitats. They use coastal areas in Asia with birds in Sulawesi observed to be eating sea snakes. In an agricultural landscape in north India, woolly-necked storks preferred fallow fields during the summer and monsoon seasons, and natural freshwater wetlands during the winter. Here, irrigation canals were preferentially used during winters when water levels were low, and birds avoided crop fields in all seasons. Assisted by construction of new irrigation canals, this species is spreading to arid areas like the Thar Desert in Rajasthan, India. Across south Asia, Asian woolly-necked storks largely use agricultural landscapes with more numbers seen using unprotected wetlands relative to the amount of wetlands on the landscape, and a majority of individuals use agricultural crops. In Haryana, north India, they nest on trees planted along crop fields and irrigation canals as part of traditional multifunctional agroforestry and generally avoid trees close to human settlements.

Individuals of this species have been sighted at altitudes of 3,790 m above sea level in China (Napahai wetland), and 3,540 m above sea level in Nepal (Annapurna Conservation Area).
== Behaviour ==

Several calls by adult birds have been described including bisyllabic whistles given along with displays at the nest, and a fierce hissing sound when a bird was attacked by a trained falcon. The woolly-necked stork is a broad winged soaring bird, which relies on moving between thermals of hot air for sustained long-distance flight. Like all storks, it flies with its neck outstretched. It has also been observed to &#x27;roll, tumble and dive at steep angles&#x27; in the air with the wind through its quills making a loud noise. Adult birds have also been observed diving from nests before flying away abruptly in a &#x27;bat-like flight&#x27;.

This species is largely seen as single birds, in pairs, or in small family groups of 4–5. While flocks are uncommon, they occur in all parts of the distribution range of the species and can be seen in all seasons. Flocking is affected by different factors in different areas. In more arid areas, most of the flocks occur in the summer when few wetlands are remaining, whereas in areas with more water, flocks occur largely in winter after chicks have fledged from nests. However, on agricultural landscapes, artificial irrigation introduces considerable complexity in providing water throughout the year, and flocks occur throughout the year. They often associate with wintering stork species including the Black and White Storks.

Asian woolly-necked storks using south Asian agricultural landscapes showcased changing seasonal behaviors consistent with altering landscape conditions. Storks changed their most preferred habitats (relative to availability of each habitat) from natural wetlands in the winter to dry fallow fields in the summer, and actively avoided (used much less relative to available) flooded rice paddies. Analogous to this change of preferred habitat seasonally, Asian woolly-necked storks in lowland Nepal spent less time foraging (suggesting higher efficiency of finding food) during the winter relative to monsoon when rice paddies was the dominant crop. These two observations suggest that Asian woolly-necked storks preferred drier crops as foraging habitats, and its foraging efficiency improved in less wet crops. Additionally, storks in Nepal did not alter behaviors from foraging to the energy expending alert behaviors when they were close to farmers, though time spent being alert reduced considerably while foraging in wetland habitats. This suggests that the storks do not view farmers are a significant threat. Activity budgets of woolly-necked storks in lowland Nepal were identical to that recorded for similar storks in protected and managed reserves suggesting that south Asian croplands provide considerable benefits as suitable foraging areas with minimal disturbances by farmers to large water birds such as Asian woolly-necked storks. 
===Diet===
The Asian woolly-necked stork walks slowly and steadily on the ground seeking its prey, which like that of most of its relatives, consists of amphibians, reptiles and insects.

===Breeding===
Typically, a large stick nest is built on a tree, and clutch size is two to six eggs, with five and six eggs being less common. Birds use both forest trees and scattered trees in agricultural areas to build nests. In India, some nests have been being observed in or near urban areas on cell phone towers, but such nesting on artificial human-made structures is not a regular occurrence. Riverside cliffs are occasionally used for nesting.

In Haryana, north India, nesting woolly-necked storks used trees close to irrigation canals and far from human habitation for nesting, and were not affected by the presence of natural wetlands and relatively larger patches of trees on the landscape. Very few nests each year were placed on artificial structures such as electricity pylons, and the majority were placed on &quot;Dalbergia sissoo&quot;, &quot;Ficus religiosa&quot; and &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; sp. In Haryana&#x27;s agricultural landscape, small numbers of woolly-necked stork nests were also found on &quot;Acacia nilotica&quot;, &quot;Azadirachta indica&quot;, &quot;Mangifera indica&quot;, &quot;Mitragyna parviflora&quot;, &quot;Syzhygium cumini&quot; and &quot;Tectona gradis&quot;. Asian woolly-necked storks reused over 44% of nest sites for multiple years. Brood size of 42 successful nests in Haryana was relatively high with over three chicks successfully fledging from nests, and a small number of nests each year fledging four and five chicks each with six chicks fledging from one nest. Detailed observations of breeding habits in north India suggest that the woolly-necked stork is not an obligate wetland species unlike other stork species that locate their nests close to wetlands.

Two nests of woolly-necked storks were reused after stork chicks had fledged by black kites &quot;Milvus migrans&quot; in lowland Nepal. Asian woolly-necked stork nests in Haryana were preferentially reused by dusky eagle-owls &quot;Bubo coromandus&quot; over other large nests made by other bird species in the area. It seems likely that Asian woolly-necked storks support the well-being of many other species, including large raptors such as dusky eagle-owls, via commensal and other inter-species relationships associated with their nests.

== Conservation ==
The species was elevated from &quot;Near-threatened&quot; to &quot;Vulnerable&quot; in 2014 based on anecdotal reports of deforestation in south-east Asia potentially leading to catastrophic population declines with the assumption that the species required protected wetlands inside forested reserves. It was, however, down listed to &quot;Near-threatened&quot; in 2019 after concrete evidence emerged from south Asia and Myanmar that the erstwhile population estimate was a severe underestimate, and that most woolly-necked storks used agricultural areas and unprotected wetlands, with abundances being lower inside forested reserves. Agricultural landscapes in north India support considerable numbers of breeding pairs that have relatively large brood sizes and behaviors similar to storks in protected managed reserves suggesting that this species is not an obligate wetland bird and that it is not reliant on undisturbed protected wetlands and forest reserves. An earlier &quot;guesstimate&quot; of the south and south-east Asian population of woolly-necked storks of 25,000 has been revised upwards to an estimated &gt; 2,00,000 storks in south Asia alone.

Counts carried out along the Mekong river in Cambodia (first survey in 2006 and 2007, followed by another in 2018) showed some variations in numbers of Woolly-necked Storks counted. These variations may have been due to differences in count methods and season making it difficult to know if population sizes of this species has changed along the River Mekong. Modeled distributions of woolly-necked storks strongly overlapped forested reserves in south-east Asia suggesting low ability to survive outside forests in stark contrast to the situation in south Asia and Myanmar. The majority of the protected reserve forests and wetlands in south-east Asia are under threat suggesting that woolly-necked storks face an uncertain future in this region.

<doc id="464592" wikidata="Q557551" url="?curid=464592" title="Xu Zhimo">
<text>Xu Zhimo (, , Mandarin: , 15 January 1897 – 19 November 1931) was a Chinese romantic poet and writer of modern Chinese poetry who strove to loosen Chinese poetry from its traditional forms and to reshape it under the influences of Western poetry and the vernacular Chinese language. He died in a plane crash at age 34.

==Biography==
Xu Zhimo has several names. He is most known as Xú Zhìmó (; Wu IPA: , Wu pinyin: Zhi Tsymu; Mandarin IPA: , Wades-Giles: Hsü Chih-mo), while he was born Xú Zhāngxù () with the courtesy name Yǒusēn ().

Xu was born in Haining, Zhejiang and graduated from Hangzhou High School, a well-known school in Southern China. He married Zhang Youyi in 1915 and attended Peiyang University in 1916 (now Tianjin University) to study law. In 1917, he moved to Peking University (PKU) due to the law department of Peiyang University merging into PKU. In 1918, he traveled to the United States to earn his bachelor&#x27;s degree at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he took up a major in political and social sciences, along with a minor in history. 

Shortly afterward, he enrolled at Columbia University in New York to pursue a graduate degree in economics and politics in 1919. He left New York in 1920, having found the U.S. &quot;intolerable&quot;, to go study in England at London School of Economics. In 1921, he transferred to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge as a special student, where he fell in love with English Romantic poetry like that of Keats and Shelley.

He was also influenced by the French romantic and symbolist poets, some of whose works he translated into Chinese. In 1922 he returned to China and became a leading figure of the modern poetry movement. In 1923, he founded the Crescent Moon Society, a Chinese literary society that was part of the larger New Culture Movement, believing in &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot; and often engaging in running debates with the &quot;art for politics&#x27; sake&quot; (Chinese Communist Party-driven) League of the Left-Wing Writers. 

When the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore visited China, Xu Zhimo served as one of his oral interpreters. Xu used vernacular Chinese and translated Western romantic forms into modern Chinese poetry. He worked as an editor and professor at several schools before his death on 19 November 1931, dying in a plane crash near Jinan and Tai&#x27;an, Shandong while flying on a Stinson Detroiter from Nanjing to Beijing. He left behind four collections of verse and several volumes of translations from various languages.
===Love affairs===
Xu Zhimo&#x27;s various love affairs with Zhang Youyi, Lin Huiyin, and Lu Xiaoman are well known in China. Xu married Zhang Youyi, (the sister of the politician Zhang Junmai) on 10 October 1915. This was an arranged marriage that went against Xu&#x27;s belief in free and simple love. Although Zhang gave birth to two sons, Xu still couldn&#x27;t accept her. While in London in 1921, Xu met and fell in love with Lin Huiyin (the daughter of Lin Changmin). He divorced Zhang in March 1922. Inspired by this newly found love, Xu wrote a large number of poems during this time. Lin and Xu became friends. However, she was already betrothed to Liang Sicheng by his father. Xu&#x27;s last lover was Lu Xiaoman, who was married to Wang Geng, a friend of Xu. The marriage had been arranged by her parents and she felt trapped in this loveless marriage. When Xu and Lu met, they quickly bonded over the similarity of their respective experiences with arranged marriages. When it came to be known that they were in love, both were scorned by their parents and friends. Lu divorced her husband in 1925 and married Xu the next year. Their honeymoon period did not last long however and Lu gradually became more and more depressed. Because of Lu&#x27;s spending habits and Xu&#x27;s parents refusing to lend them money, Xu had to take several jobs in different cities to keep up with the lifestyle Lu desired. She was widowed when Xu died in an airplane crash.

Xu was also romantically linked to American author Pearl S. Buck and American journalist Agnes Smedley.

In an obituary, writer Wen Yuan-ning commented that Xu&#x27;s &quot;relations with women are exactly like Shelley&#x27;s. Let no woman flatter herself that Tse-mo has ever loved her; he has only loved his own inner version of Ideal Beauty.&quot;

===Airplane crash===

On 19 November 1931, Xu prepared to leave Nanking to attend a lecture given by Lin Huiyin at a university in Peking. He boarded a China Airways Federal Stinson Detroiter, an aircraft contracted by Chunghwa Post to deliver airmail on the Nanjing-Beijing route. However, when the flight arrived in the Jinan area, the flight encountered severe fog, leaving the pilot with no clear view to land. The plane descended into the mountainous area below unnoticed as both the pilots were looking for the course according to the map. When the aircraft was aiming to turn left to go back to the course again, it hit the peak of a mountain and broke off the right wing. The plane spun out of control and crashed into the mountains near Jinan City and Tai&#x27;an City, in Shandong province. Xu Zhimo, who suffered from fatal cerebral trauma and several cuts on his body, was killed instantly as well as one of the two pilots. The first officer survived the initial impact, but also perished due to the delay in rescue.

The accident was attributed to both pilots&#x27; misjudgement of the flight&#x27;s altitude as well as their failure to recognize the terrain. However, it was rumoured that Xu was murdered, although this was confirmed to be untrue.

<doc id="464598" wikidata="Q353783" url="?curid=464598" title="Cao Yu">
<text>Cao Yu (, September 24, 1910 – December 13, 1996) was a Chinese playwright, often regarded as one of China&#x27;s most important playwrights of the 20th century. His best-known works are &quot;Thunderstorm&quot; (1933), &quot;Sunrise&quot; (1936) and &quot;Peking Man&quot; (1940). It is largely through the efforts of Cao Yu that the modern Chinese &quot;spoken theatre&quot; took root in 20th century Chinese literature.

Cao Yu was the president of China&#x27;s Premier Modern Drama Theatre, the chairman of the China Theatre Association (1968–1998) and established the Beijing People&#x27;s Art Theatre in 1952. Cao Yu is regarded as the paramount playwright of modern Chinese drama, &quot;enthroned as China&#x27;s Shakespeare&quot; according to &quot;The Columbia Anthology of Modern Chinese Drama&quot;.

== Name ==
Cao Yu, the name most associated with this playwright, was a pen name; his birth name was Wan Jiabao ().

The pseudonym was originated from his surname . Cao dismantled the character into its graphical components and . Since the radical could not be used as a surname, he chose the near-homophonic character as the substitution and combined the two character to form .

==Early life, 1910–1920==
Cao Yu was born as Wan Jiabao in an upper-class family in Qianjiang in the province of Hubei, 1910. When he was still an infant, his family&#x27;s business interests necessitated a move to Tianjin where his father worked for a time as secretary to China&#x27;s president, Li Yuanhong. Tianjin was a cosmopolitan city with a strong western influence, and during his childhood, Yu&#x27;s mother would often take him to see western style plays, which were gaining in popularity at the time, as well as to productions of Chinese traditional opera.

Such western style spoken theatre, or &quot;huaju&quot;, made inroads in China under the influence of noted intellectuals such as Chen Duxiu and Hu Shih, who were proponents of a wider cultural renewal campaign of the era, marked by anti-imperialism, and a re-evaluation of Chinese cultural institutions, such as Confucianism. The enterprise crystallized in 1919, in the so-called May Fourth Movement.

==Literary beginnings – 1920s==
Between 1920 and 1924, Cao Yu attended Tianjin Nankai High School, which offered a western style study program. The school maintained a society of dramatic arts in which the students produced western works, notably those of Henrik Ibsen and Eugene O&#x27;Neill, who were well-known authors in China thanks to translations published by Hu Shih. Cao Yu took acting roles in a number of the society&#x27;s dramatic productions, even going so far as to assume the female role of Nora in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;. He is also known to have assisted in the translation of Englishman John Galsworthy&#x27;s 1909 work, &quot;Strife&quot;.

After finishing his studies at Nankai secondary school, Cao Yu first matriculated at Nankai University&#x27;s Department of Political Science but transferred the next year to Tsinghua University, where he would study until graduating in 1934 with a degree in Western Languages and Literature. During his university studies, Cao Yu improved his abilities in both Russian and English. His course of studies required reading the works of such western authors as Bernard Shaw and Eugene O&#x27;Neill, and of Russian authors such as Anton Chekhov and Maxim Gorky, as well as translated works of classic Greek writers, Euripides and Aeschylus. This immersion in western literature would mark Yu&#x27;s style in all writing genres including the &quot;spoken theater&quot; which had had little tradition in China prior to Yu&#x27;s influence (as opposed to sung Chinese opera), . During the course of his last year at the university, Cao Yu completed his first work, &quot;Thunderstorm&quot;, which would mark a milestone in Chinese theater&#x27;s history of the 20th century.

While works of Chinese playwrights previous to Cao Yu are of fundamentally historical interest and were famed in China, they garnered little critical success or popularity on the international stage. By contrast, the works of Cao Yu were marked by a whirlwind of worldwide interest, turning him into the first Chinese playwright of international renown.

== The First &quot;Golden Age&quot; of &quot;Huaju&quot; (spoken drama) mid-1930s ==
Cao Yu&#x27;s trilogy, &quot;Thunderstorm&quot; (1934)&quot;, Sunrise&quot; (1936) and &quot;Wildness&quot; (1937) helped to usher the modern Chinese drama into the first &quot;Golden Age&quot; in the mid-1930s. These plays and their productions marked the maturation of Chinese dramatic literature and achievement in professionalism in staging production, including lighting, props, sets and costumes.

Cao Yu&#x27;s works launched the wave of &quot;realistic drama&quot; in the 1930s, which reflected the society&#x27;s different sides and served as the instrument of criticism.

The leading figures in the modern Chinese spoken drama including Cao Yu, Hong Shen, Guo Moruo, Xia Yan, Ouyang Yuqian, Tian Han and Lao She composed a new trend of Chinese spoken drama, that interpreted the drama as a critique of the whole society and social values, and aroused the masses of the people.

=== &quot;Thunderstorm&quot; (雷雨 &quot;Lei yu&quot;), (1934) ===
&quot;Thunderstorm&quot; is considered as one of the most popular dramatic Chinese works of the period prior to the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. It was first published in the literary magazine, &quot;Literary Quarterly&quot; (wenxue jikan), which was founded in 1934 by Chinese intellectuals, Zheng Zhenduo and Jin Yi. Shortly after its publication, a production of the play was mounted in Jinan, and later, in 1935, in Shanghai and in Tokyo, both of which were well received. In 1936, &quot;Thunderstorm&quot; debuted in Nanjing, with Cao Yu himself acting in the lead role. In 1938, following its theatrical triumphs, the play was made into two separate movies productions, one in Shanghai and another in Hong Kong, that were almost coincidental versions of one another. The latter production, made in 1957, co-starred a young Bruce Lee in one of his few non-fighting roles.

The plot of &quot;Thunderstorm&quot; centers on one family&#x27;s psychological and physical destruction as a result of incest, as perpetrated at the hands of its morally depraved and corrupt patriarch, Zhou Puyuan. Although it is undisputed that the prodigious reputation achieved by &quot;Thunderstorm&quot; was due in large part to its scandalous public airing of the topic of incest, and many people have pointed out technical imperfections in its structure, &quot;Thunderstorm&quot; is nevertheless considered to be a milestone in China&#x27;s modern theatrical ascendancy. Even those who have questioned the literary prowess of Cao Yu, for instance, the noted critic C.T. Hsia, admit that the popularization and consolidation of China&#x27;s theatrical genre is fundamentally owed to the first works of Cao Yu.

&quot;Thunderstorm&quot; was first published in a literary magazine in 1934, and staged in numerous cities over the next few years. Several film adaptations and remake stage productions have been made.

===&quot;Sunrise&quot; (日出 &quot;Richu&quot;), 1936 and &quot;The Wilderness&quot; (原野 &quot;Yuanye&quot;), 1937===
In Cao Yu&#x27;s second play, &quot;Sunrise&quot;, published in 1936, he continues his thematic treatment of the progressive moral degradation of individuals in the face of a hostile society. In the play, the history of several Shanghai women are narrated; their stories show their lives disintegrating in response to lack of affection and of acknowledgment by the society surrounding them, leading them down a tragic path from which they cannot escape. By centring upon the female characters, Cao Yu introduced feminism ideas and included the early enlightenment of women&#x27;s liberation in his works.

In 1937, Cao Yu&#x27;s third play, &quot;The Wilderness&quot; (the Chinese name of which can also be translated as &quot;The Field&quot;), was released, but enjoyed less attention than his previous works.

==During the Japanese occupation, 1937–1946==
After the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, Cao Yu took shelter in the central city of Chongqing, along with the government of Chiang Kai-shek. There he wrote his fourth work, &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, which greatly departed from his previous works, concerning itself with patriotic exaltation. Produced for the first time in 1939, the play is set in a military hospital that is bombed by the Japanese army. Although a change for Cao Yu, he was in good company as concentrating on war themes and settings was favored by most of the prominent Chinese writers active during the Second Sino-Japanese war in areas controlled by the government of Chongqing. By contrast, in northern China, controlled by Mao Zedong&#x27;s communists, an altogether different type of literature was developing, dedicated to exalting the communist movement.

=== &quot;Peking Man&quot; (北京人 &quot;Beijing ren&quot;), 1940 ===
In 1940, Cao Yu completed the writing of his fifth play, &quot;Peking Man&quot;, considered his most profound and successful work. Set in Peking (today Beijing) as its name implies, and in the then present, surprisingly the work does not allude to the war with Japan at all, but chronicles the history of a well-heeled family that is incapable of surviving and adapting to social changes which are destroying the traditional world and culture in which they live. The title of the work is an allusion to the so-called Peking Man, the proto-human who inhabited the north of China several hundred thousand years ago. Cao Yu&#x27;s recurrent themes are present, emphasizing the inability of traditional families to adapt themselves to modern society and its customs and ways.

In 1941, while still in Chongqing, Cao Yu completed a theatrical adaptation of the famous work, &quot;The Family&quot;, by novelist, Ba Jin. His last written work during the Japanese occupation was &quot;The Bridge&quot;, published in 1945 but not produced as a play until 1947, after the end of the war .
During his tenure in Chongqing, Cao Yu taught classes in the city&#x27;s School of Dramatic Art and completed a translation into Chinese of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in 1948.

==Visit to the United States, 1946==
Following the end of the war, Cao Yu traveled to the United States with another celebrated Chinese writer Lao She as the guests of U.S. state department in 1946. Together, the two spent 11 months touring the U.S. for teaching Chinese drama to the academic audiences. After returning to China, Cao Yu was hired by a movie studio based in Shanghai to write the screenplay and to direct the 1946 released movie, &quot;Day of the Radiant Sun&quot; &quot;(艷陽天 / 艳阳天; Yànyángtiān)&quot;.

== After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic, 1949==
After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, Cao Yu became the director of the &quot;Popular Theater Art League&quot;, a post he held for the rest of his life. In his youth Cao Yu had been critical of Communist ideology. But his first works, with their portrait of decline and cruelty brought on by bourgeois society, were admitting of a Marxist interpretation. Thus they became very popular in 1960s Chinese society, when the ideology of Mao Zedong demanded that all literary creation serve the Communist cause. During this period, Cao Yu became a social activist.

In addition to supervising successive production of his earliest plays, Cao Yu kept on writing, and in 1956, published &quot;Bright Skies&quot;. Thereafter, in 1961, the decade of his major public recognition, he published &quot;Courage and the Sword (膽劍篇 / 胆剑篇 Dan jian pian)&quot;, his first historical drama. This work, although set at the end of the Zhou dynasty during the Warring States period, contains pronounced allusions to the defeat of Mao&#x27;s political ideology as embodied in his Great Leap Forward. His and others&#x27; critiques of Mao, and the struggle for power in the halls of government, ultimately ended in the Cultural Revolution, which Mao used to reaffirm his power and fight against &quot;bourgeois and capitalist elements&quot; in politics and culture. The attacks against intellectuals during the Cultural Revolution affected Cao Yu, causing him distress and alienation. However, he was rehabilitated himself after Mao&#x27;s death and Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s subsequent rise to power.

Cao Yu&#x27;s last work was &quot;Wang Zhaojun (王昭君)&quot;, released in 1979. On December 13, 1996, at 86 years of age, Cao Yu died in Beijing.

Cao Yu&#x27;s daughter Wan Fang is also a playwright.

<text>USS &quot;Santa Fe&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Santa Fe&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-four Bofors guns in four quadruple and four double mounts and twenty-one Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Santa Fe&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==
&quot;Santa Fe&quot; was laid down at the New York Shipbuilding Co. at Camden, New Jersey, on 7 June 1941. She was launched of 10 June 1942, and after completing fitting out, she was commissioned on 24 November. Captain Russell S. Berkey served as the ship&#x27;s first commanding officer. She thereafter conducted her shakedown cruise and initial training off the East Coast of the United States into early 1943, before sailing for the Pacific Ocean, where she joined the forces engaged in the Pacific Theater of World War II. She arrived in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 22 March and proceeded from there to the Aleutian Islands. She arrived in Alaskan waters on 20 April, and six days later she took part in a bombardment of Japanese-held Attu Island. She participated in patrols off the Aleutians for the next four months during the Aleutian Islands campaign, and she shelled Kiska on 6 and 22 July before American forces landed on the island the following month. She provided gunfire support to the forces that went ashore there on 15 August. Ten days later, &quot;Santa Fe&quot; left the area and arrived back in Pearl Harbor on 1 September.

===Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign===

The ship next joined Cruiser Division 13, which was attached to support the Fast Carrier Task Force. She joined a raid by the fleet&#x27;s aircraft carriers on Tarawa on 18–19 September and then an attack on Wake Island on 5–6 October. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; also bombarded Wake and disabled Japanese coastal artillery batteries. On 21 October, she got underway with the Fast Carrier Task Force, but while en route, &quot;Santa Fe&quot; was detached to cover troop ships sailing for Bougainville. They arrived there on 7 November; &quot;Santa Fe&quot; remained there to protect the transports as they unloaded their cargoes. She helped to defend the vessels during heavy Japanese air attacks over the next two days before departing for Espiritu Santo. On 14 November, she sortied as part of the escort for the invasion fleet for the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; shelled Tarawa from 20 to 22 November, during the Battle of Tarawa. She left on 26 November to rejoin the Fast Carrier Task Force, which began the next phase of the campaign with air strikes on Kwajalein on 4 December. The fleet returned to Pearl Harbor on 9 December.

In late 1943, &quot;Santa Fe&quot; arrived back in the United States to begin preparations to join the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. She took part in amphibious assault exercises off San Pedro, California, in January 1944, and on 13 January, she got underway with the invasion fleet. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; and several other vessels sailed ahead of the fleet to bombard Wotje Atoll on 30 January to prepare for the invasion of Kwajalein, which was to take place the following day. The ship then returned to the invasion fleet to support the marines as they went ashore on Kwajalein. The ship remained offshore through 1 February to bombard Japanese forces as the Americans fought their way across the island, before departing for Majuro, arriving there on 7 February.

On 12 February, &quot;Santa Fe&quot; sortied as part of the escort for the Fast Carrier Task Force, which raided Truk on 16–17 February and then Saipan on 22 February. The ships then passed back through Majuro for Espiritu Santo, where they replenished for the next major operation. She sortied again on 15 March, accompanying the carriers and , to support the landing on Emirau, which took place unopposed five days later. On 30 March and 1 April, she covered the carriers while they struck Japanese positions on Palau, Yap, and Woleai. By 13 April, she had transferred to a task group centered on the carrier , which was sent to western New Guinea to support Allied ground operations there, including the Battle of Hollandia. The group raided Wakde and Sawar on 21 April, including a bombardment by &quot;Santa Fe&quot; and other elements of the carrier screen. On 28 April, the task group was sent north to raid Truk, Satawan, and Pohnpei from 29 April to 1 May. Three days later, they arrived back in Kwajalein.

===Mariana and Palau Islands campaign===

&quot;Santa Fe&quot; next joined a task group led by the carrier , which sortied in June to begin the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. These began with a series of air strikes on Saipan, Tinian, and Guam from 11 to 16 June during the initial operation, the invasion of Saipan. The American offensive prompted a major response by Japan&#x27;s fleet, which led to the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Japanese carrier aircraft struck first, on the morning of 19 June, and &quot;Santa Fe&quot; contributed her anti-aircraft fire to driving off the attackers. American ships and aircraft inflicted serious losses on Japanese carrier aircraft, and the next day, American carrier planes struck the withdrawing Japanese fleet late in the day. To help guide the returning planes in the darkness, &quot;Santa Fe&quot; used her searchlights, despite the risk of illuminating herself to Japanese submarines that might be in the area. &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; joined air strikes on Pagan Island on 24 June, after which the task group returned to Eniwetok three days later to rearm and refuel.

On 30 June, &quot;Santa Fe&quot; got underway again, this time again accompanying &quot;Hornet&quot;. The carriers struck Iwo Jima, and &quot;Santa Fe&quot; and other warships bombarded the island on 4 July. The ships then turned back south to resume attacks in the Marianas, and from 6 to 21 July, they attacked Japanese airfields between Guam and Rota to prevent them from interfering with the planned invasion of Guam. The carriers then struck the islands of Yap and Ulithi before returning to Saipan, which had since been seized by American forces. Later that day, the task force sortied again for another attack on Iwo Jima. Two days later, &quot;Santa Fe&quot; and other vessels encountered a Japanese convoy escorted by the destroyer ; they sank &quot;Matsu&quot; and several transports of the convoy. The next day, the ships bombarded Iwo Jima again. They then sailed for Eniwetok, arriving there on 11 July. There, &quot;Santa Fe&quot; transferred to a task group centered on the carrier . They next sortied to carry out strikes on Peleliu from 6 to 8 September, in preparation for the invasion of Peleliu scheduled for the following week. The carriers then shifted to targets in Mindanao in the southern Philippines on 9 and 10 September to prevent them from interfering with the Peleliu operation. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; and other cruisers intercepted another Japanese convoy on 9 September and sank several vessels. The carriers raided Japanese positions in the area from 12 to 14 September and again from 21 to 24 September, before withdrawing to the Kossol Roads in the Palau islands to replenish.

===Philippines campaign===

As the American fleet began preparations for the Philippines campaign, the Fast Carrier Task Force carried out a series of strikes on Japanese airfields on Okinawa and Formosa from 10 to 13 October. During the Formosa Air Battle on 13 October, &quot;Santa Fe&quot; and her sister ships and were sent to cover the withdrawal of their sister and the heavy cruiser , which had been badly damaged in Japanese air attacks. Four days later, &quot;Santa Fe&quot; arrived back with the carriers to cover them during the invasion of Leyte.

&quot;Santa Fe&quot;″s task group then moved on to launch air strikes on Japanese airfields in the Visayas on 21 October. The next day, they withdrew to refuel before searching for Japanese naval forces that were reportedly in the area over 23 and 24 October. Later on the 24th, Japanese aircraft launched a major attack on the fleet that was defeated, and that evening, the Japanese carriers of the Northern Force were detected. The American fleet turned north to intercept them, and early the next morning, a force of six fast battleships and seven cruisers—including &quot;Santa Fe&quot;—were detached to pursue the Japanese carriers to try to catch them in a surface action. The American carriers also launched air strikes against the Northern Force, but later that day, reports of the battleships and cruisers of the Center Force attacking the invasion fleet prompted the Americans to detach most of their surface forces to try to block the Japanese battleships. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; and three other cruisers remained with the Fast Carrier Task Force to sink damaged vessels of the Northern Force, which included the carrier and the destroyer . The carrier task groups re-formed the next day and sailed for Ulithi, arriving there on 30 October.

&quot;Santa Fe&quot;″s task group sailed on 1 November, bound for Manus, where the ships were to undergo maintenance. The ships were quickly recalled after reports of Japanese warships off Leyte, though this proved to be false. The American fleet and forces ashore came under heavy air attack, however, so the task group was kept in the area to help defend American units. The task group&#x27;s carriers launched retaliatory air strikes on Manila, the capital of the Philippines, on 5 and 6 November, followed by another round of strikes on other targets from 11 to 14 November. Three days later, the ships returned to Ulithi for replenishment. On 20 November, Japanese midget submarines entered the anchorage and sank the oiler . &quot;Santa Fe&quot; sent her floatplanes to pick up survivors from the sinking.

On 22 November, the task group sortied once again for attacks on Japanese positions in the Philippines, which began three days later. They remained in action off the Philippines until 1 December, when they departed for another period of rest and replenishment at Ulithi. By mid-month, they had joined the forces supporting the landing on Mindoro. On 18 and 19 December, Typhoon Cobra struck the fleet, sinking three destroyers. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; and other vessels searched for survivors before returning to Ulithi on 24 December. They remained there until 30 December, when the task group got underway to carry out a raid of Japanese airfields on Okinawa and Formosa on 3 and 4 January 1945. On 6 January, they turned south to strike targets on Luzon in the Philippines in preparation for the planned invasion of Lingayen Gulf. Attacks on Japanese airfields in the region continued through 9 January, after which the Fast Carrier Task Force sailed south to launch the South China Sea raid. On 21 January, strikes on Formosa resumed, followed by more attacks on Okinawa the following day. The fleet returned to Ulithi on 26 January to replenish.

===Iwo Jima and Okinawa campaigns===
&quot;Santa Fe&quot; and the rest of her task group sortied on 10 February to attack airfields in the Tokyo area to neutralize aircraft that would interfere with the impending invasion of Iwo Jima. The carriers launched their raids on 16 and 17 February, and the next day, after sailing south to Iwo Jima, &quot;Santa Fe&quot; was detached to carry out bombardments of Japanese positions on the island. She shelled Japanese defenses from 19 to 21 February, including coastal artillery batteries on Mount Suribachi; she also fired star shells to illuminate targets at night. By 25 February, she had returned to her task group to cover the carriers for another attack on the Tokyo area. The ships thereafter returned to Ulithi for replenishment.

The ship was transferred to the task group centered on the carrier on 14 March; four days later, the ships were off Japan for another round of strikes on installations on Kyushu, this time including the naval bases at Kure and Kobe, where the carrier aircraft attacked some of the remaining elements of the Japanese fleet on 19 March. That day, while the carriers were in the process of launching their strike planes, a Japanese bomber hit the carrier with a pair of bombs, starting serious fires. Several loaded aircraft were clustered on the flight deck, which quickly caught fire as well and contributed to the explosions that badly damaged the carrier. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; came alongside to assist with rescue efforts and to help suppress the fires. After about three hours, the fires were under control, and some 833 men had been evacuated from &quot;Franklin&quot;. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; was also damaged in the course of assisting &quot;Franklin&quot;, and both ships withdrew to Ulithi; the carrier had to be taken under tow by the heavy cruiser . &quot;Santa Fe&quot; and &quot;Franklin&quot; then left Ulithi on 27 March, bound for Pearl Harbor. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; received a Navy Unit Commendation for her crew&#x27;s efforts in saving &quot;Franklin&quot;. The ship&#x27;s commander, Captain Harold Fitz, was awarded the Navy Cross. and three crewmen were awarded Silver Stars for risking their own lives to rescue men from &quot;Franklin&quot; who were in the water.

&quot;Santa Fe&quot; proceeded on to San Pedro, California, where she underwent an overhaul that lasted from 10 April to 14 July. She thereafter got underway to rejoin the fleet, arriving in Pearl Harbor on 1 August. She joined the carrier and &quot;Birmingham&quot;; the ships were ordered to attack Wake Island, but the orders were cancelled after Japan announced it would surrender on 15 August. The ships instead sailed on to Eniwetok and then continuing on to Okinawa, arriving in Buckner Bay on 26 August. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; sailed to Sasebo, Japan, on 20 September, and from 17 October to 10 November, she took part in the occupation of Hokkaido and northern Honshu. From 10 November, she was assigned to Operation Magic Carpet, the effort to repatriate American soldiers, sailors, and marines. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; brought home men from Saipan, Guam, and Truk over the course of two voyages. The ship received thirteen battle stars for her wartime service.

&quot;Santa Fe&quot; thereafter sailed to Bremerton, Washington, on 25 January 1946. She was decommissioned there on 19 October and assigned to the Bremerton Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet, where she remained for the next thirteen years. She was ultimately struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959 and sold for scrap on 9 November to Zidell Explorations, Inc., where she was broken up.

<text>A close-up or closeup in filmmaking, television production, still photography, and the comic strip medium is a type of shot that tightly frames a person or object. Close-ups are one of the standard shots used regularly with medium and long shots (cinematic techniques). Close-ups display the most detail, but they do not include the broader scene. Moving toward or away from a close-up is a common type of zooming. A close up is taken from head to neck, giving the viewer a detailed view of the subject&#x27;s face.

==History==
Most early filmmakers, such as Thomas Edison, Auguste and Louis Lumière and Georges Méliès, tended not to use close-ups and preferred to frame their subjects in long shots, similar to the stage. Film historians disagree as to the filmmaker who first used a close-up. One of the best claims is for George Albert Smith in Hove, who used medium close-ups in films as early as 1898 and by 1900 was incorporating extreme close-ups in films such as &quot;As Seen Through a Telescope&quot; and &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Reading Glass&quot;. In 1901, James Williamson, also working in Hove, made perhaps the most extreme close-up of all in &quot;The Big Swallow&quot; in which his character approaches the camera and appears to swallow it. D. W. Griffith, who pioneered screen cinematographic techniques and narrative format, is associated with popularizing the close up with the success of his films. For example, one of Griffith&#x27;s short films, &quot;The Lonedale Operator&quot; (1911), makes significant use of a close-up of a wrench that a character pretends is a gun. Lillian Gish remarked on Griffith&#x27;s pioneering use of the close-up:

The people in the front office got very upset. They came down and said: &quot;The public doesn&#x27;t pay for the head or the arms or the shoulders of the actor. They want the whole body. Let&#x27;s give them their money&#x27;s worth.&quot; Griffith stood very close to them and said: &quot;Can you see my feet?&quot; When they said no, he replied: &quot;That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing. I am using what the eyes can see.&quot;

==Practical application==
Close-ups are used in many ways and for many reasons. They are often employed as cutaways from a more distant shot to show detail, such as characters&#x27; emotions or some intricate activity with their hands. Close cuts to characters&#x27; faces are used far more often in television than in movies and are especially common in soap operas. For a director, deliberately avoiding close-ups may create in the audience an emotional distance from the subject matter.

Close-ups are used for distinguishing main characters. Major characters are often given a close-up when they are introduced as a way of indicating their importance. Leading characters will have multiple close-ups. At the close of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950), the main character, a faded star under the delusion that she is making a triumphant return to acting, declaims melodramatically, &quot;All right, Mr. DeMille, I&#x27;m ready for my close-up.&quot;

Close-up shots do not show the subject in the broad context of its surroundings. Low-budget films may use close-ups to avoid the expense of set construction. If overused, close-ups may leave viewers uncertain as to what they are seeing. Close-ups are rarely done with wide-angle lenses because perspective causes objects closer to the lens to be unnaturally enlarged. That may convey a sense of confusion, intoxication, or another unusual mental state.

==Close-up types==

There are various degrees of close-up depending on how tight (zoomed in) the shot is. The terminology varies between countries and even different companies, but in general, these are:
* Medium Close Up (&quot;MCU&quot; on camera scripts): Halfway between a mid shot and a close-up. Usually covers the subject&#x27;s head and shoulders.
* Close Up (&quot;CU&quot;): A certain feature, such as someone&#x27;s head, takes up the whole frame.
* Extreme Close Up (&quot;ECU&quot; or &quot;XCU&quot;): The shot is so tight that only a detail of the subject, such as someone&#x27;s eyes, can be seen.
* Lean-In: when the juxtaposition of shots in a sequence, usually in a scene of dialogue, starts with medium or long shots, for example, and ends with close-ups.
* Lean-Out: the opposite of a &quot;lean-in&quot;, moving from close-ups out to longer shots.
* Lean: when a &quot;lean-in&quot; is followed by a &quot;lean-out&quot;.
When the close-up is used in the shooting, the subject should not be put in exactly the middle of the frame. Instead, it should be located in the frame according to the law of the golden section.

<text>The Big Bend is part of the Trans-Pecos region in southwestern Texas, United States along the border with Mexico, north of the prominent bend in the Rio Grande for which the region is named. Here the Rio Grande passes between the Chisos Mountains in Texas and the Sierra Madre Oriental in Mexico as it changes from running east-southeast to north-northeast. The region covers three counties: Presidio County to the west, Brewster County to the east, and Jeff Davis County to the north.

The region is rugged, sparsely populated Chihuahua Desert, including the Chisos Mountains, Chinati Mountains, and the Davis Mountains. The region has well over of public lands, including Big Bend National Park (801,163 acres) and Big Bend Ranch State Park (300,000 acres), Black Gap Wildlife Management Area (103,000 acres), Chinati Mountains State Natural Area (39,000 acres) along the north side of the Rio Grande. It is also the home of the McDonald Observatory. In Mexico, adjacent areas of protected lands on the south side of the Rio Grande include the Cañón de Santa Elena Flora and Fauna Protection Area (ca. 511,508 acres), Ocampo Flora and Fauna Protection Area (ca. 850,630 acres), and the Maderas del Carmen Flora and Fauna Protection Area (ca. 514,920 acres).

The largest towns in the region are Alpine, Presidio, Marfa, Sanderson, Terlingua, and Marathon. The counties are Presidio County, Jeff Davis County, Brewster County, Pecos County, and Terrell County.

<text>The African spoonbill (Platalea alba) is a long-legged wading bird of the ibis and spoonbill family Threskiornithidae. The species is widespread across Africa and Madagascar, including Botswana, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.

==Biology==
It lives in marshy wetlands with some open shallow water and nests in colonies in trees or reedbeds. They usually don&#x27;t share colonies with storks or herons. The African spoonbill feeds in shallow water, and fishes for various fish, molluscs, amphibians, crustaceans, insects and larvae. The animal uses its open bill to catch foods by swinging it from side-to-side in the water, which catches foods in its mouth. Long legs and thin, pointed toes enable it to walk easily through varying depths of water.

The African spoonbill is almost unmistakable through most of its range. The breeding bird is all white except for its red legs and face and long grey spatulate bill. It has no crest, unlike the common spoonbill. Immature birds lack the red face and have a yellow bill. Unlike herons, spoonbills fly with their necks outstretched.

==Breeding==
The African spoonbill begins breeding in the winter, which lasts until spring. During the breeding season, adult male African Spoonbills develop more plumage and brighter coloration. The spoonbill&#x27;s nest, generally located in trees above water, is built from sticks and reeds and lined with leaves. Three to five eggs are laid by the female birds, usually during the months of April or May. The eggs are incubated by both parents for up to 29 days, and upon hatching the young birds are cared for by both parents for around 20 to 30 days. The birds are ready to leave the nest soon afterward, and begin flying after another four weeks.

The African spoonbill is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>Locke, also known as Locke Historic District, is an unincorporated community in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta of California, United States. The was first developed between 1893 and 1915 approximately one mile north of the town of Walnut Grove in Sacramento County.

Locke is a primarily agricultural community near State Route 160, south of Sacramento. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1990 as a unique example of a historic Chinese American rural community. The population as of 2021 was estimated to be about 100, with Chinese Americans no longer forming the majority.

The village of Lockeport (shortened to &quot;Locke&quot; in 1920) began where the Sacramento Valley Railway and Union Pacific Railroads merged at the southwest corner of the deeded on July 6, 1883, to founder, George W. Locke, and his mercantile business partner, Samuel P. Lavenson. Both men were lured in their youth by the California Gold Rush.

After a fire destroyed the Chinatown of nearby Walnut Grove in 1915, many Chinese immigrants from the town resettled in and further developed Locke. Chinese-owned businesses were established, along with a Chinese language school. The town continued to thrive as a Chinese American agricultural community until after World War II, when younger residents begin leaving the town for better educational and employment opportunities in urban centers.

==History==


The delta swampland on which Locke was built on was home to Native American Miwok and Maidu tribes for hundreds of years. Tribal burial grounds exist on the Locke parcel.

Legislation such as the Swampland Reclamation Act of 1861 was enacted in California to put perceived empty and wasted lands to use and stabilization. Much of this involved draining the Delta wetlands and building levees to regulate flood control in places like Locke. Mainly poor Chinese immigrants were hired to do this backbreaking reclamation work. Contracted labor was often paid the equivalent of less than one dollar a day per worker. They built hundreds of miles of levees in waist deep water where malaria still rampaged, reclaiming a total .

In 1912, three Chinese merchants, two from the nearby town of Vorden and one from Walnut Grove, contracted tradesmen to construct three buildings. Chan Tin Sin built the first building. It was a combination dry goods store and beer saloon. Yuen Lai Sing built a gambling hall. Owyang Wing Cheong built the Lockeport Hotel &amp; Restaurant.

Following that early construction the Canton Hotel was built, along with several other buildings. A total of seven structures eventually formed the hamlet of Lockeport. Though some merchants hoped to provide a destination for riverboat and train passengers, the idea never worked due to the discrimination against Chinese during those times. One of the homes built in the first phase of construction provided shelter for Chan Tin Sin&#x27;s cousin Chan Chor Get and his family from the discriminatory acts and violence in San Francisco Chinatown.

On October 7, 1915, the Chinatown of nearby Walnut Grove was destroyed by an accidental fire. Afterwards, the Main Street section of Locke was established and settled by a group of Chinese immigrants from what is now modern day Zhongshan in southern China&#x27;s Guangdong province, headed by Lee Bing, a Chinese American businessman. Whereas Taishanese-speaking Chinese settlers remained in Walnut Grove after the fire to rebuild, the Cantonese-speaking Zhongshan Chinese settlers migrated to Locke to create a town of their own. The land was leased from George Locke as California law at the time forbade the selling of farmland to Asian immigrants by the California Alien Land Law of 1913.

Due to its relatively large Chinese population at the time, the Chinese Kuomintang political party once had a local chapter in Locke. As the town grew, so did its reputation as a destination for illicit entertainment, gaining the nickname &quot;California&#x27;s Monte Carlo&quot;. At one point, it had five gambling halls, five brothels, speakeasies and opium dens.

The population of Locke swelled with the growing season and harvest. Most of the reclaimed land in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta including Locke was used for cash crops, including asparagus, potato, sweet potatoes, white beans, pears, and apples. There would be as many as 1000 to 1500 Chinese people living in Locke. Farmhands shared rooms in the boarding houses. Chinese residents living in the homes behind Main Street also took in Chinese farm laborers. Chinese immigrants in Locke started patterns in California agriculture that are continued today in the Sacramento-San Joaquin region, including contracted labor, tenant farming, sharecropping, and the piece wage system. A community garden existed in the back and there was a special oven to make roast pigs on Sundays. Chinese communities congregated in solidarity under difficult labor and social conditions fostered by legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act, creating community gardens that maintained cultural relevancy in the form of growing Chinese cabbage, snow peas, leafy vegetables, winter melon, and tomatoes. Baptist missionary Dr. Charles Shepherd would bring in his Chungmei home boys for the pear harvest at the end of July. Life in Locke had a great deal of accord. The Chinese mothers took care of each other&#x27;s children when another mother had to go to work at the cannery across the River Road next to the riverboat docks of the Sacramento River.

During the 1940s and 1950s, many of Locke&#x27;s Chinese Americans, many of whom received better education, began joining the American mainstream by moving out of rural Locke and into the burgeoning suburbs of the major cities.

The Locke Historic District is bounded on the west by the Sacramento River, on the north by Locke Rd., on the east by Alley St., and on the south by Levee St. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 6, 1971.

A Hong Kong-based developer purchased the town in 1977 from the Locke Heirs and sold it in 2002 to the Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency. In 2004, the agency finally allowed the sale of land to those who had been living on it for many years. There were plans to convert Locke into a housing development and tourist attraction. At the north end of Main Street, the restored Locke Boarding House museum (now owned by California State Parks) operates daily, staffed by volunteers. The Town of Locke celebrated its centennial anniversary in 2015, with a large gathering on May 9.

On July 3, 2016, a fire erupted on the second floor of the Locke Country Store on Main Street, which contained two apartments. The fire resulted in the complete destruction of the second floor of the building and a building behind the store. There were no injuries.

The Locke Historic District was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 14, 1990.

==Politics==
In the state legislature, Locke is in the 3rd State Senate district, represented by Democrat Bill Dodd, and in the 11th State Assembly district, represented by Democrat Jim Frazier.

Federally, Locke is in .

==Post office==
Locke had its own ZIP Code of 95649, but it was discontinued shortly after the post office bearing that code closed on August 2, 1963. Since then, Locke uses Walnut Grove&#x27;s ZIP code of 95690, and the community is inside area code 916.

<text>A wiki wiki dollar was a giveaway promotion in the United States from the Chevron gasoline company during the 1960s. The advertising campaign featured a wiki wiki girl, played by dancer Irene Tsu, dressed in a grass skirt and performing a brisk hula while standing on a gasoline pump.

The &quot;National Petroleum News&quot; noted it was one of the many promotional gimmicks attempted by gasoline companies in the 1960s and described it as part of &quot;a late Sixties West Coast duel&quot; between Chevron and Shell:

Chevron paid game players &quot;Wiki Wiki Dollars&quot; of $1 to $2,500 for matching segments of game pieces and offered more than $2,300,000 in prizes as part of a &quot;hula&quot; bingo game.

In the &quot;San Francisco Express Times&quot; in 1969, editor Marvin Garson denounced the campaign as part of an article on Standard Oil, the corporate predecessor of Chevron. He wrote:

Standard debauches the public taste with its garish $2,300,000 hula-hula Wiki Wiki Dollar giveaway. Standard strangles the beauty of the American road.

Vlatko Vuković Kosača ({{lang-sr-cyr|Влатко Вуковић Косача}}; died between August 1392 and August 1393{{sfn|Kurtović|2009|pp=20-26}}) was a 14th-century Bosnian nobleman who held the titles of the &quot;vojvoda humski&quot; (duke of Hum) and Grand Duke of Bosnia. He distinguished himself as one of the best military commanders of King Tvrtko I in battles against the Ottoman Empire.

==Biography==

Vlatko was probably a son of duke Vuk Kosača, often regarded as founder of the Kosača noble family. He governed Hum (part of modern-day Herzegovina), which was part of the Banate of Bosnia and later Kingdom of Bosnia.

The Ottoman threat was building to the east, threatening Bosnia and its southeastern regions in Hum. On 27 August 1388, Grand Duke Vlatko defeated an Ottoman raiding party (probably up to 18,000 strong) in the Battle of Bileća. Bosnian heavy cavalry is typically credited with winning the battle as they broke the Ottoman ranks and pursued the retreating enemy. Celebrated Ottoman commander Lala Sahin Pasha ({{langx|tr|Lala Şahin Paşa}}, 1330 – {{circa}}1382) barely managed to save himself with the small band of his soldiers.

In 1389, dispatched by his king Tvrtko I, he commanded a Bosnian army contingent as part of a Christian coalition that fought alongside Serbian prince Lazar Hrebeljanović at the Battle of Kosovo against the Ottomans. Vuković was one of few commanders who survived the battle. Although the battle is viewed now as tactically inconclusive, at the time the battle was viewed differently - Vuković reported the outcome of the battle as a victory, as the Ottomans suffered heavy losses and were forced to withdraw for a time.

In 1391–1392, council was convoked by the king or noblemen who opposed the sale of Konavli by Radič Sanković to Dubrovnik, and Vuković and Pavle Radenović later captured Konavli and divided it between themselves.

== Death and burial ==
He died sometime between August 1392 and August 1393.{{sfn|Kurtović|2009|pp=20-26}} His nephew Sandalj Hranić succeeded him. 

=== Stećak confusion ===
It was thought that both Vlatko&#x27;s and his wife&#x27;s graves lie marked in a stećak necropolis near the village of Boljuni, not far from Stolac, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Written in Bosnian Cyrillic, the inscription on that particular grave says: &quot;Ase leži dobri junak i čovjek Vlatko Vuković&quot; ({{lit|Here lies a good hero and good man, Vlatko Vuković}}); however, neither grave belongs to a famous duke or his wife.{{sfn|Kurtović|2009|p=21|ps=: footnote 47}}

<text>Black Majesty is an Australian power metal band formed in 2001 as Kymera. The band was founded by guitarist Steve Janevski (ex-Cyclone Tracy) and bassist Cory Betts (ex-Pegazus). After the release of a three track sampler album, they signed a five-album contract with German-based label, LMP Records. The group released their fifth studio album, &quot;Stargazer&quot;, in July 2012.

==History==
===Early: Kymera===
The band was formed in Melbourne in 2001 under the name Kymera. Guitarist Steve Janevski was drawn from Cyclone Tracy, a long-running heavy rock/hair metal outfit. Bassist Cory Betts was a member of Pegazus, a Melbourne power metal band that had toured Europe in 1998, although he did not join that band until early 1999. Kymera&#x27;s other guitarist Hanny Mohammed had recorded an album with a band called Catwitch who had been featured on a television documentary. The band dropped the Kymera moniker due to a US band sharing the same name. After a flirtation with the name Arkaya, the band began recording material but Betts then left and the group renamed itself Black Majesty.

===Black Majesty===
The &quot;Sands of Time&quot; album was recorded in 2002 and prefaced by a three-track promo disc that gained them a five-album contract with German label LMP. The album&#x27;s sound was a mixture of progressive metal and power metal drawing influence from Queensrÿche and Jag Panzer. Reviews of the album were extremely positive, and in several online polls it won &quot;Album of the Year&quot; honors. Bass tracks were recorded by both Betts and Evan Harris, and Cavaliere duetted with Silvio Massaro from Vanishing Point and cousin Danny Cecati from Eyefear on two tracks. Joe Fata replaced Betts in the interim but left before the album was released in 2003 and since then Black Majesty has not had a permanent bass player, instead looking towards local bass players to fill duties. During this time period guitarist Hanny Mohammed played bass at infrequent live shows with fellow Australian power metal band Pegazus, although by the end of 2002 Mohammed fully focused on his work in Black Majesty.

Bassists Mark Kelson of Melbourne doom band The Eternal and Harris have featured as touring members, Harris contributing to the band&#x27;s next release also, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Silent Company&quot;. The album&#x27;s sound slightly changed from &quot;Sands of Time&quot;, the band dropping their small progressive touches and going for a more straightforward melodic sound. For the recording of &quot;Silent Company&quot; Pavel Konvalinka recorded his drum tracks in Germany with Piet Sielck of Iron Savior whilst the remainder of the band recorded their tracks at Palm Studios in Melbourne with producer Endel Rivers. The album&#x27;s release was preceded by a short tour of Europe, where the band gained exposure to their primary market by playing solo shows and gaining spots on festivals featuring bands such as HammerFall and Edguy. On the band&#x27;s return to Australia they launched the album with additional solo dates before touring with British band DragonForce and American metal group Nevermore. The band then began writing songs for their next album while sporadically performing live shows, focusing on the writing and recording of their third studio effort.

Black Majesty&#x27;s third album &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; was released on 1 June 2007. The album was launched by another European tour which featured slots at festivals such as Masters of Rock, Benatska Noc, and Europe&#x27;s biggest heavy metal festival, Wacken Open Air, along with a few solo club dates. Bass duties were filled by Richard Filak. Upon Black Majesty&#x27;s return to Australia, they launched &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; with various shows around Melbourne. In the following months Black Majesty continued to display their prominence on the Australian Power Metal scene playing solo shows along with supporting Helloween in February. They recently supported Saxon on their April tour of Australia.

Black Majesty started work on its fourth album in February 2009 for Limb Music Products. The group supported former Iron Maiden singer Paul Dianno on two of his Australian shows on 30 May at the Hifi Bar &amp; Ballroom in Melbourne, and on 6 June at the Manning Bar in Sydney. In November that year they appeared at Screamfest in Sydney. Black Majesty will play a one-off concert in Jakarta, Indonesia as part of the Jak Sound, Jakarta Sound &amp; Music Expo on 6 February 2010. Black Majesty released their fourth album, &quot;In Your Honour&quot;, in 2010 which was mixed by Roland Grapow. The release was promoted with several shows around Australia as well as a headlining slot at Indonesia&#x27;s Bla Bla Bla Festival. The band recently announced a European tour to support the album&#x27;s release.

<doc id="464617" wikidata="Q426635" url="?curid=464617" title="Periclase">
<text>Periclase is a magnesium mineral that occurs naturally in contact metamorphic rocks and is a major component of most basic refractory bricks. It is a cubic form of magnesium oxide (MgO). In nature it usually forms a solid solution with wüstite (FeO) and is then referred to as ferropericlase or magnesiowüstite.

It was first described in 1840 and named from the Greek περικλάω (to break around) in allusion to its cleavage. The type locality is Monte Somma, Somma-Vesuvius Complex, Naples Province, Campania, Italy.

The old term for the mineral is &quot;magnesia&quot;. Stones from the Magnesia region in ancient Anatolia contained both magnesium oxide and hydrated magnesium carbonate as well as iron oxides (such as magnetite). Thus these stones, called &quot;Stones from Magnesia&quot; in antiquity, with their unusual magnetic properties were the reason the terms &quot;magnet&quot; and &quot;magnetism&quot; were coined.

Periclase is usually found in marble produced by metamorphism of dolomitic limestones. It readily alters to brucite under near surface conditions.

In addition to its type locality, it is reported from Predazzo, Trentino, Italy; Carlingford, County Louth, Ireland; Broadford, Skye and the island of Muck, Scotland; León, Spain; the Bellerberg Volcano, Eifel district, Germany; Nordmark and Långban, Varmland, Sweden; and Kopeysk, southern Ural Mountains, Russia. In the US it occurs at the Crestmore quarry, Riverside County, California; Tombstone, Arizona; Gabbs district, Nye County, Nevada. In Canada, it occurs at Oka, Quebec and in Australia, west of Cowell, Eyre Peninsula, South Australia.

The crystal structure of periclase corresponds to that of halite and has been studied extensively due to its simplicity. As a consequence, the physical properties of periclase are well known, which makes the mineral a popular standard in experimental work. The mineral has been shown to remain stable at pressures up to at least 360 GPa.

== Mantle occurrence ==
Ferropericlase makes up about 20% of the volume of the lower mantle of the Earth, which makes it the second most abundant mineral phase in that region after silicate perovskite ; it also is the major host for iron in the lower mantle. At the bottom of the transition zone of the mantle, the reaction

: γ–

transforms γ-olivine into a mixture of perovskite and ferropericlase and &quot;vice versa&quot;. In the literature, this mineral phase of the lower mantle is also often called magnesiowüstite.

<doc id="464643" wikidata="Q1432659" url="?curid=464643" title="Battle of the Lipari Islands">
<text>The Battle of the Lipari Islands or Battle of Lipara was a naval encounter fought in 260 BC during the First Punic War. A squadron of 20 Carthaginian ships commanded by Boödes surprised 17 Roman ships under the senior consul for the year Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio in Lipara Harbour. The inexperienced Romans made a poor showing, with all 17 of their ships captured, along with their commander.

The Romans had recently built a fleet in order to contest the Carthaginians&#x27; maritime control of the western Mediterranean and Scipio had impetuously ventured to the Liparas with the advance squadron. The battle was little more than a skirmish, but is notable as the first naval encounter of the Punic Wars and the first time Roman warships had engaged in battle. Scipio was ransomed after the battle and known thereafter as (Latin for &quot;female donkey&quot;). The Romans went on to win the two, larger, naval encounters that followed and establish a rough sea-going parity.

==Primary sources==
The main source for almost every aspect of the First Punic War is the historian Polybius ( – 118 BC), a Greek sent to Rome in 167 BC as a hostage. His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics, but he is best known for his work &quot;The Histories&quot;, written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the battle. Polybius&#x27;s work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.

Carthaginian written records were destroyed along with their capital, Carthage, in 146 BC and so Polybius&#x27;s account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, Greek and Latin sources. Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about. Only the first book of the 40 comprising &quot;The Histories&quot; deals with the First Punic War. The accuracy of Polybius&#x27;s account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius&#x27;s account. The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that &quot;Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable&quot;; while Dexter Hoyos describes him as &quot;a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian&quot;. Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form, and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea. Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of Diodorus Siculus and Dio Cassius, although the classicist Adrian Goldsworthy states that &quot;Polybius&#x27; account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts&quot;.

Other sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the trireme &quot;Olympias&quot;. Since 2010 a number of artefacts have been recovered from the site of the Battle of the Aegates, the final battle of the war, fought nineteen years later. Their analysis and the recovery of further items are ongoing.

==Background==
===Operations in Sicily===

The First Punic War between Carthage and Rome broke out in 264BC. Carthage was a well-established maritime power in the western Mediterranean; Rome had recently unified mainland Italy south of the River Arno under its control. The immediate cause of the war was control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern Messina). More broadly both sides wished to control Syracuse, the most powerful city-state on Sicily. By 260 BC the war had lasted four years, and the Romans had pushed forward into Sicily, with a number of successes, including the capture of Agrigentum, an important Carthaginian base. However, the Carthaginian navy repeatedly raided the Romans&#x27; rear areas and even the coast of Italy. Their control of the sea also made it impossible for the Romans to successfully blockade those Carthaginian cities which were on the coast. The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty.

===Ships===
During this war the standard warship was the quinquereme, meaning &quot;five-oared&quot;. The quinquereme was a galley, long, wide at water level, with its deck standing above the sea, and displacing around 100 long tons (110 short tons; 100 tonnes). The galley expert John Coates suggested they could maintain for extended periods. The modern replica galley &quot;Olympias&quot; has achieved speeds of and cruised at for hours on end. Vessels were built as cataphract, or &quot;protected&quot;, ships, with a closed hull and a full deck able to carry embarked legionaries as marines and catapults. They had a separate &quot;oar box&quot; attached to the main hull which contained the rowers. These features allowed the hull to be strengthened, increased carrying capacity and improved conditions for the rowers.

In 260 BC the Romans set out to construct a fleet and used a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own. As novice shipwrights, the Romans built copies that were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, which made them slower and less manoeuvrable. The quinquereme was the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout the Punic Wars, so ubiquitous that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for &quot;warship&quot; in general. A quinquereme carried a crew of 300, of which 280 were oarsmen and 20 deck crew and officers; it would normally also carry a complement of 40 marines, and if battle was thought to be imminent, this would be increased to as many as 120.
Getting the oarsmen to row as a unit, as well as execute more complex battle manoeuvres, required long and arduous training. At least half of the oarsmen would need to have had some experience if the ship was to be handled effectively. As a result, the Romans were initially at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. All warships were equipped with a ram, a triple set of bronze blades weighing up to positioned at the waterline. They were made individually by the lost-wax method to fit immovably to a galley&#x27;s prow and secured with bronze spikes. In the century prior to the Punic Wars, boarding had become increasingly common and ramming had declined, as the larger and heavier vessels adopted in this period lacked the speed and manoeuvrability necessary to ram, while their sturdier construction reduced the ram&#x27;s effect even in the case of a successful attack.

==Battle==
It was the long-standing Roman procedure to elect two men each year, known as consuls, to each lead their military forces. The patrician Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio, the year&#x27;s senior consul, was given command of the fleet. He put to sea with the first 17 ships produced. As the first-ever Roman warships they spent some time training in home waters before sailing to Messana. There they prepared for the main fleet&#x27;s arrival and supported the logistics of the Roman army at the sea crossing to Sicily.

While Scipio was at the Strait of Messina he received information that the garrison of the city of Lipara was willing to defect to the Roman side. Lipara was the main port of the Lipari Islands and was a constant threat to Roman communications across the Strait. Though his crews were still inexperienced and the newly designed and built ships were still undergoing their sea trials, the consul could not resist the temptation of conquering an important city without a fight and sailed to Lipara. It has been suggested by some ancient sources that the offer to surrender Lipara was a ruse inspired by Carthage to encourage the Romans to commit their ships where they could be ambushed, but the sources do not give much detail and are usually pro-Roman.

The Romans entered the harbour at Lipara. The Carthaginian fleet was commanded by Hannibal Gisco, the general who had commanded the garrison at Agrigentum, and was based at Panormus (modern-day Palermo) some from Lipari. When he heard of the Romans&#x27; advance to Lipara he despatched 20 ships under Boödes, a Carthaginian aristocrat, to the town. The Carthaginians arrived at night and trapped the Romans in the harbour. Boödes led his ships in an attack on the Romans inside the harbour the next morning. Scipio&#x27;s men offered little resistance. The inexperienced crews were no match for the well-drilled Carthaginians and were rapidly outfought. Some Romans panicked and fled inland and the consul himself was taken prisoner, along with many of the other Roman senior officers. Some later accounts have Scipio treacherously captured while parleying, but this is probably a Roman fabrication. All of the Roman ships were captured, most with little damage. The battle was little more than a skirmish, but is notable as the first naval encounter of the Punic Wars and the first time Roman warships had engaged in battle.

==Aftermath==
Scipio was later released, probably ransomed. His easy defeat earned him the pejorative cognomen , which means &quot;donkey&quot; in Latin. This cognomen was all the more insulting because &quot;asina&quot; was the feminine form of the word donkey, as opposed to the masculine form &quot;asinus&quot;. In spite of this Scipio&#x27;s career prospered and he was consul for a second time in 254 BC.

Shortly after the Lipara victory, Hannibal Gisco was scouting with 50 Carthaginian ships when he encountered the full Roman fleet. He escaped, but lost most of his ships. It was after this skirmish that the Romans installed the on their ships. The was a bridge wide and long, with a heavy spike on the underside, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship&#x27;s deck. This allowed marines to more easily board enemy ships and capture them.

Later the same year Scipio&#x27;s fellow consul, Gaius Duilius, placed the Roman army units under subordinates and took command of the fleet. He promptly sailed, seeking battle. The two fleets met off the coast of Mylae in the Battle of Mylae. Hannibal Gisco had 130 ships, and the historian John Lazenby calculates that Duilius had approximately the same number. Using the the Romans captured 50 Carthaginian vessels and dealt the Carthaginians a sharp defeat.

The war was to last for another 19 years before ending in a Carthaginian defeat and a negotiated peace. Thereafter Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. The Romans had built more than 1,000 galleys during the war, and this experience of building, manning, training, supplying, and maintaining such numbers of ships laid the foundation for Rome&#x27;s maritime dominance for 600 years.

<text>The Battle of Mylae took place in 260 BC during the First Punic War and was the first real naval battle between Carthage and the Roman Republic. This battle was key in the Roman victory of Mylae (present-day Milazzo) as well as Sicily itself. It also marked Rome&#x27;s first naval triumph and also the first use of the &quot;corvus&quot; in battle.

==Prelude==
Inspired by success in the battle of Agrigentum, the Romans sought to win all of Sicily, but required naval power to do so. In order to challenge the already prominent Carthaginian naval forces, Rome built a fleet of one hundred quinqueremes and twenty triremes. The famous Greek historian Polybius wrote that Rome used a wrecked Carthaginian quinquereme captured at Messina as a model for the entire fleet, and that the Romans would have otherwise had no basis for design. However, this may have been an exaggeration, as the Romans had also borrowed Greek quinqueremes previously in 264.

Rome&#x27;s two consuls of 260 were Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina and Gaius Duilius. It had been decided that the former would handle the fleet and that Duilius would command the army. However, Scipio&#x27;s first encounter with the enemy in the Battle of the Lipari Islands led to the loss of 17 ships and an embarrassing surrender to the Carthaginians under the general Senator Boodes and the naval commander Hannibal Gisco. This was the same Hannibal who had retreated after the conquest of Agrigentum, but not the famous Hannibal who would much later invade Italy during the Second Punic War. After Scipio Asina&#x27;s surrender, the remaining fleet was placed in the hands of Duilius, and the foot soldiers were turned over to military tribunes.

The Romans recognized their weakness in naval power and tactics, especially after the incident of the Lipari Islands. With this in mind they constructed the &quot;corvus,&quot; a plank to link ships together at sea. The inventor of the &quot;corvus&quot; is unknown, but it could have been a Syracusan, such as Archimedes. This device would be attached to the prow of Roman ships on a rotating axle, so that it could be swung around; and its spiked end could then be dropped onto an enemy ship. In this way the Romans could still make use of their superior soldiers by loading them across the &quot;corvus&quot; and onto enemy ships.

==Battle==

Duilius met Hannibal off northern Mylae in 260. Polybius states that the Carthaginians had 130 ships, but does not give an exact figure for the Romans. The loss of 17 ships at the Lipari Islands from a starting total of 120 ships suggests that Rome had 103 remaining. However, it is possible that this number was larger than 103, thanks to captured ships and the assistance of Roman allies. The Carthaginians anticipated victory, especially because of their superior experience at sea.

The &quot;corvi&quot; helped the Romans seize the first 30 Carthaginian ships that got close enough, including the Carthaginian flagship. To avoid the &quot;corvi,&quot; the Carthaginians were forced to navigate around them and approach the Romans from behind, or from the side. The &quot;corvi&quot; were usually still able to pivot and grapple most oncoming ships. Once an additional 20 of the Carthaginian ships had been hooked and lost to the Romans, Hannibal retreated with his surviving ships, leaving Duilius with a clear victory. In 2008, a rostrum was found off Acqualadroni. C14 dating indicates that this rostrum could have belonged to the Carthaginian fleet. Instead of following the remaining Carthaginians at sea, Duilius sailed to Sicily to retrieve control of the troops. There he saved the city of Segesta, which had been under siege from the Carthaginian infantry commander Hamilcar. Modern historians have wondered at Duilius&#x27; decision not to immediately follow up with another naval attack, but Hannibal&#x27;s remaining 80 ships were probably still too strong for Rome to conquer.

==Aftermath==
Success at Mylae allowed the Romans to pursue Hannibal to Sardinia, where the Romans again destroyed a large part of the Carthaginian fleet. At this point Hannibal was arrested by his own men back in Carthage and crucified for his incompetence. As for Duilius, a rostral column, or victory column, was raised with an inscription in his honor in the Forum. The remnants of this inscription were found at Rome and are now kept in the Capitoline Museum. The inscription reports that during the Battle of Mylae Duilius captured 31 ships, sunk 13 more, and took booty of gold and silver worth at least 2,100,000 sesterces. Upon returning home Duilius received Rome&#x27;s first naval triumph, which the inscription boasts was the first triumph to include native free-born Carthaginians. He also built a Temple of Janus in the Forum Holitorium, some of which can still be seen in the walls of the church of San Nicola in Carcere. Despite his success, Duilius never held another office of high command, although he became censor in 258 BC.

==Cultural depictions==
In T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Waste Land,&quot; Part I, &quot;The Burial of the Dead&quot; ends with the following passage:

There I saw one I knew, and called him, crying:&lt;br&gt;
Stetson! You who were with me in the ships at Mylae. &lt;br&gt;
That corpse you planted last year in your garden: &lt;br&gt;
Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year? &lt;br&gt;
Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed? &lt;br&gt;
Oh, keep the dog far hence, that&#x27;s friend to men, &lt;br&gt;
Or with his nails, he&#x27;ll dig it up again. &lt;br&gt;
You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!

<doc id="464650" wikidata="Q7239248" url="?curid=464650" title="Pre-money valuation">
<text>&quot;Pre-money valuation&quot; is a term widely used in the private equity and venture capital industries. It refers to the valuation of a company or asset prior to an investment or financing. If an investment adds cash to a company, the company will have a valuation after the investment that is equal to the pre-money valuation plus the cash amount. That is, the pre-money valuation refers to the company&#x27;s valuation before the investment. It is used by equity investors in the primary market, such as venture capitalists, private equity investors, corporate investors and angel investors. They may use it to determine how much equity they should be issued in return for their investment in the company. This is calculated on a fully diluted basis. For example, all warrants and options issued are taken into account.

Startups and venture capital-backed companies usually receive multiple rounds of financing rather than a big lump sum. This is in order to decrease the risk for investors and to motivate entrepreneurs. These rounds are conventionally named Round A, Round B, Round C, etc. Pre-money and post-money valuation concepts apply to each round.

==Basic formula==

There are many different methods for valuing a business, but basic formulae include:

:formula_1

:formula_2

==Round A==

Shareholders of Widgets, Inc. own 100 shares, which is 100% of equity. If an investor makes a $10 million investment (Round A) into Widgets, Inc. in return for 20 newly issued shares, the post-money valuation of the company will be $60 million. ($10 million * (120 shares / 20 shares) = $60 million).

The pre-money valuation in this case will be $50 million ($60 million - $10 million). To calculate the value of the shares, we can divide the Post-Money Valuation by the total number of shares after the financing round. $60 million / 120 shares = $500,000 per share.

The initial shareholders dilute their ownership from 100% to 83.33%, where equity stake is calculated by dividing the number of shares owned by the total number of shares (100 shares/120 total shares).

Series A Cap table
==Round B==

Let&#x27;s assume that the same Widgets, Inc. gets the second round of financing, Round B. A new investor agrees to make a $20 million investment for 30 newly issued shares. If you follow the example above, it has 120 shares outstanding, with 30 newly issued shares. The total of shares after Round B financing will be 150. The Post-money valuation is $20 million * (150 / 30) = $100 million.

The Pre-money valuation is equal to the Post-money valuation minus the investment amount – in this case, $80 million ($100 million - $20 million).

Using this, we can calculate how much each share is worth by dividing the Post-money valuation by the total number of shares. $100 million / 150 shares = $666,666.66 / share

The initial shareholders further dilute their ownership to 100/150 = 66.67%.

Series B Cap table

Note that for every financing round, this dilutes the ownership of the entrepreneur and any previous investors.

==Up round and down round==

Financing rounds can be categorized into three types: up round, down round, and flat round. This categorization may be used to quickly, but imprecisely, determine whether a round has been successful for company stakeholders. The precise definition of these terms has been debated by industry participants. Debate focuses on whether price per share or company valuation (specifically, comparing the current pre-money valuation to the post-money valuation of the previous round) should be used as the metric to categorize the round. The Wall Street Journal considers an up round (down round) to be when capital is raised at a share price above (below) the previous round. Similarly, the WSJ considers a flat round to be when capital is raised at the same share price as the previous round. Furthermore, in a survey of ten attorneys at different Silicon Valley law firms by the WSJ, eight said that share price should be used to categorize the round.

However, the other two lawyers surveyed by the WSJ argued that both share price and valuation should be used to categorize the round because it depends on perspective. For example, depending on how the deal is structured (such as how many new shares are issued during the round), it is possible for the share price to drop while the company valuation increases. That may be considered a down round to prior investors and founders but an up round to new investors. Moreover, according to the WSJ, some companies and investors argue that only valuation should be used to categorize the round, not share price. That is, they consider an up round (down round) to be when pre-money valuation of the current round is greater (less) than the post-money valuation of the previous round. Similarly, they consider a flat round to be when the pre-money valuation of the current round is the same as the post-money valuation of the previous round.

According to the WSJ&#x27;s definition, in the examples above, the Series B funding was an up- round investment because its share price ($666,666.66) was higher than the share price of the Series A ($500,000). In other words, if the ratio of current investment and shares to be issued (for ex:- series B investment : shares issued) is greater than the ratio of Previous investment and shares previously issued (for ex:- series A investment : shares previously issued), then it will be up- round investment. If this current ratio is less than previous ratio, then it is down-round investment.
If the ratios tie up, then it is flat round investment.

Successful, growing companies usually raise equity in a series of up rounds from institutional investors. For example, institutional investors such as venture capital firms, corporate investors, private equity firms, growth equity firms, and hedge funds may participate in up rounds. Eventually, such companies may achieve a successful exit for their investors and stakeholders. For example, the company may go public via an IPO, direct listing, or merger with a SPAC. Alternatively, it may become an M&amp;A target. For example, it may be acquired by larger company or merged with a competitor.

In general, down rounds are adverse events for initial shareholders and founders, as they may cause ownership dilution, may damage the company&#x27;s reputation, and may raise the company&#x27;s cost of capital going forward. As a result, companies and investors may use financial engineering to structure a deal as an up round, even if the share price only increases by a penny. Down rounds were common during the dot-com crash of 2000–2001 and the global financial crisis of 2008–2009. As a result, a down round may not necessarily reflect poorly on the company. Rather, it may be the result of poor market conditions.

<doc id="464652" wikidata="Q204175" url="?curid=464652" title="Golden hamster">
<text>The golden hamster or Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) is a rodent belonging to the hamster subfamily, Cricetinae. Their natural geographical range is in an arid region of northern Syria and southern Turkey. Their numbers have been declining in the wild due to a loss of habitat from agriculture and deliberate elimination by humans. Thus, wild golden hamsters are now considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. However, captive breeding programs are well established, and captive-bred golden hamsters are often kept as small house pets. They are also used as scientific research animals.

Syrian hamsters are larger than many of the dwarf hamsters kept as pocket pets (up to five times larger), though the wild European hamster exceeds Syrian hamsters in size.

== Characteristics ==
Adult golden hamsters can reach around long. Females are usually larger than males, with a body mass of around and lifespan of 1.5-2 years. Syrian hamsters from private breeders can be in the range of .

Like most members of the subfamily, the golden hamster has expandable cheek pouches, which extend from its cheeks to its shoulders. In the wild, hamsters are larder hoarders; they use their cheek pouches to transport food to their burrows. Their name in the local Arabic dialect where they were found roughly translates to &quot;mister saddlebags&quot; () due to the amount of storage space in their cheek pouches.

Sexually mature female hamsters come into heat (estrus) every four days. Golden hamsters and other species in the genus &quot;Mesocricetus&quot; have the shortest gestation period in any known placental mammal at around 16 days. Gestation has been known to last up to 21 days, but this is rare and almost always results in complications. They can produce large litters of 20 or more young, although the average litter size is between eight and 10 pups. If a mother hamster is inexperienced or feels threatened, she may abandon or eat her pups. A female hamster enters estrus almost immediately after giving birth, and can become pregnant despite already having a litter. This act puts stress on the mother&#x27;s body and often results in very weak and undernourished young.

== Discovery ==
Golden hamsters originate from Syria and were first described by scientists in the 1797 second edition of &quot;The Natural History of Aleppo&quot;, a book written and edited by two Scottish physicians living in Syria. The Syrian hamster was then recognized as a distinct species in 1839 by British zoologist George Robert Waterhouse, who named it &quot;Cricetus auratus&quot; or the &quot;golden hamster&quot;. The skin of the holotype specimen is kept at the Natural History Museum in London.In 1930, Israel Aharoni, a zoologist and professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, captured a mother hamster and her litter of pups in Aleppo, Syria. The hamsters were bred in Jerusalem as laboratory animals.

Descendants of the captive hamsters were shipped to Britain in 1931, where they came under the care of the Wellcome Bureau of Scientific Research. These bred and two more pairs were given to the Zoological Society of London in 1932. The descendants of these were passed on to private breeders in 1937.

In 1946, Albert Marsh began the first commercial hamster breeding business, Gulf Hamstery, to promote the Syrian hamster as pets and laboratory animals.

A separate stock of hamsters was exported from Syria to the United States in 1971, but mitochondrial DNA studies have established that all domestic golden hamsters are descended from one female – likely the one captured in 1930 in Syria.

Since the species was named, the genus &quot;Cricetus&quot; has been subdivided and this species (together with several others) was separated into the genus &quot;Mesocricetus&quot;, leading to the currently accepted scientific name for the golden hamster of &quot;Mesocricetus auratus&quot;.

== Behavior ==

A solitary species, Syrian hamsters are very territorial and intolerant of each other; attacks against each other are commonplace. Exceptions do occur, usually when a female and male meet when the female is in heat, but even so, the female may attack the male after mating. In captivity, babies are separated from their mother and by sex after four weeks, as they sexually mature at four to five weeks old. Same-sex groups of siblings can stay with each other until they are about eight weeks old, at which point they will become territorial and fight with one another, sometimes to the death. Infanticide is not uncommon among female golden hamsters. In captivity, they may kill and eat healthy young as a result of the pups interacting with humans, as any foreign scent is treated as a threat. Females also eat their dead young in the wild.

Golden hamsters mark their burrows with secretions from special scent glands on their hips called flank glands. Male hamsters in particular lick their bodies near the glands, creating damp spots on the fur, then drag their sides along objects to mark their territory. Females also use bodily secretions and feces.

== Survival in the wild ==

Following Professor Aharoni&#x27;s collection in 1930, only infrequent sightings and captures were reported in the wild. Finally, to confirm the current existence of the wild golden hamster in northern Syria and southern Turkey, two expeditions were carried out in September 1997 and March 1999. The researchers found and mapped 30 burrows. None of the inhabited burrows contained more than one adult. The team caught six females and seven males. One female was pregnant and gave birth to six pups. All these 19 caught golden hamsters, together with three wild individuals from the University of Aleppo, were shipped to Germany to form a new breeding stock.

Observations of females in this wild population have revealed, contrary to laboratory populations, that activity patterns are crepuscular rather than nocturnal, possibly to avoid nocturnal predators such as owls.

== As research animals ==

Golden hamsters are used to model human medical conditions including various cancers, metabolic diseases, non-cancer respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, and general health concerns. In 2006 and 2007, golden hamsters accounted for 19% of the total Animal Welfare Act-covered animal research subjects in the United States.

== As pets ==

Golden hamsters are popular as house pets due to their docile, inquisitive nature, cuteness, and small size. However, these animals have some special requirements that must be met for them to be healthy. Although some people think of them as a pet for young children, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals recommends hamsters as pets only for people over age 6 and the child should be supervised by an adult. Cages should be a suitable size, safe, comfortable, and interesting. If a hamster is constantly chewing or climbing on the bars of its cage, then it needs more stimulation or a larger enclosure. The recommended size for a hamster cage is , of continuous floor space or larger. These can be made by cutting and connecting large plastic storage bins, or by using a large glass aquarium. Appropriately sized wooden enclosures can be made, or bought online. The majority of hamster cages sold in pet stores do not meet these size requirements. Hamster Society Singapore (HHS) recommends a minimum of for Syrian hamsters, while Tierärztliche Vereinigung für Tierschutz (TVT) recommends giving them as much space as you can and at minimum 100 cm × 50 cm × 50 cm (L × W × H) which is .

A hamster wheel is a common type of environmental enrichment, and it is important that hamsters have a wheel in their cage. TVT recommends wheels should be at least 30 cm for Syrian hamsters, since smaller diameters lead to permanent spinal curvatures, especially in young animals. They also recommend a solid running surface because rungs or mesh can cause injury, or bumblefoot. A hamster should be able to run on its wheel without arching its back. A hamster that has to run with an arched back can have back pain and spine problems. A variety of toys and cardboard tubes and boxes can help to provide enrichment, as they are energetic and need space to exercise.

Most hamsters in American and British pet stores are Syrian hamsters. Originally, Syrian hamsters occurred in just one color – the natural wild agouti – but they have since developed a variety of color and pattern mutations, including cream, white, blonde, cinnamon, tortoiseshell, black, three different shades of gray, dominant spot, banded, and dilute. Selective breeding has also produced a variety of coat types such as long-haired, satin, and rex.

== Breeding ==
The practice of selective breeding of golden hamsters requires an understanding of their care, knowledge about breed variations, a plan for selective breeding, scheduling of the female body cycle, and the ability to manage a colony of hamsters.
=== Breed variations ===
Often long-haired hamsters are referred to by their nickname &quot;teddy bear&quot;. They are identical to short-haired Syrians except for the hair length and can be found in any color, pattern, or other coat type available in the species.
Male long-haired hamsters usually have longer fur than the female, culminating in a &quot;skirt&quot; of longer fur around their backsides. Long-haired females have a much shorter coat although it is still significantly longer than that of a short-haired female.

<text>Interstate 170 (I-170), also known as the Inner Belt Expressway, is an north–south auxiliary Interstate Highway in Greater St. Louis, Missouri. I-170 connects to I-270 at its northern terminus and I-64 at its southern terminus. I-170 crosses its parent, I-70, near St. Louis Lambert International Airport.

==Route description==
==History==
I-170 was originally intended to provide an inner beltway within I-270 through St. Louis County extending to I-55 in the southern part of the county, commonly called South County; however, the portion of the route south of I-64/US Route 40 (US 40) was canceled due to local opposition. The portion of MetroLink&#x27;s Cross County Extension south of I-64 runs roughly along the proposed alignment.

The southern portion of I-170 was built using St. Louis County funds in the 1960s through a shallow valley. It was signed as Route 725.

===Recent construction===
The southern two interchanges on I-170 (at I-64/US 40 and Galleria Parkway) were reconstructed as part of the first phase of the New I-64 project. Most notably, the new interchange includes direct access to I-170 from eastbound I-64; however, access to Galleria Parkway from northbound I-170 was eliminated. Eager Road access to and from I-170 was also revised in the New I-64 project.
==Southern extension==
Proposals have been made to extend I-170 south beyond its termination at I-64/US 40, and so connect to I-55, I-270, and I-44, and to towns such as Richmond Heights, Brentwood, Maplewood, and Marlbourough. These towns currently lack direct access to the Interstates, St. Louis Lambert International Airport, South County, and to each other. Many commuters travel on slower surface streets, such as Hanley Road or River Des Peres Boulevard, raising traffic in Shrewsbury and other residential towns. These proposals had been postponed due to lack of funding.

<text>John Wesley Hardin (May 26, 1853 – August 19, 1895) was an American Old West outlaw, gunfighter, and controversial folk icon. Hardin often got into trouble with the law from an early age. He killed his first man at the age of 15, claiming he did so in self-defense.

Pursued by lawmen for most of his life, in 1877 at the age of 23, he was sentenced to 24 years in prison for murder. At the time of sentencing, Hardin claimed to have killed 42 men, while contemporary newspaper accounts attributed 27 deaths to him. While in prison, Hardin studied law and wrote an autobiography. He was well known for exaggerating or fabricating stories about his life and claimed credit for many killings that cannot be corroborated.

Within a year of his 1894 release from prison, Hardin was killed by John Selman in an El Paso saloon.

== Early life ==
Hardin was born in 1853 near Bonham, Texas, to James Gibson &quot;Gip&quot; Hardin, a Methodist preacher and circuit rider, and Mary Elizabeth Dixson. He was named after John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist denomination of the Christian church.

In his autobiography, Hardin described his mother as &quot;blond, highly cultured ... [while] charity predominated in her disposition.&quot; Hardin&#x27;s father traveled over much of central Texas on his preaching circuit until he settled his family in Sumpter, Trinity County, Texas, in 1859. There, Hardin&#x27;s father established and taught at the school that John Hardin and his siblings attended. Hardin was the second surviving son of ten children. The Hardins were Southerners and politically prominent. His great-grandfather was North Carolina provincial Congressman Colonel Joseph Hardin, the cousin of Senator Martin D. Hardin of Kentucky and father of Congressman John J. Hardin; relatives included Congressman Benjamin Hardin, Revolutionary war Colonel John Hardin of Virginia, and opposing Civil war Generals Martin Davis Hardin and Benjamin Hardin Helm.
At the outbreak of Civil War, Hardin&#x27;s father was elected a Confederate Captain; In 1862, at age nine, Hardin tried to run away from home and join the Confederate army.

=== Trouble at school ===
In 1867 while attending his father&#x27;s school, Hardin was taunted by another student, Charles Sloter. Sloter accused Hardin of being the author of graffiti on the schoolhouse wall that insulted a girl in his class. Hardin denied writing the poetry, claiming in turn that Sloter was the author. Sloter charged at Hardin with a knife, but Hardin stabbed him with his own knife, almost killing him. Hardin was nearly expelled over the incident.

=== First killing ===
In November 1868, when he was 15, Hardin challenged his uncle Holshousen&#x27;s former slave, Major &quot;Maje&quot; Holshousen, to a wrestling match, which Hardin won. According to Hardin, the following day, Maje &quot;ambushed&quot; him as he rode past shouting at him and waving a stick. Hardin drew his revolver and shot Maje five times. Hardin wrote in his autobiography that he rode to get help for the wounded man, but Maje died three days later. Hardin further wrote that his father did not believe he would receive a fair hearing in the Union-occupied state (where more than a third of the state police were former slaves), so he ordered him into hiding. Hardin claimed that weeks later the authorities eventually discovered his location, and three Union soldiers were sent to arrest him, at which time he &quot;chose to confront his pursuers&quot; despite having been warned of their approach by an older brother, Joseph:; at a creek crossing Hardin claimed to have killed two white men with a shotgun and killed a negro with a pistol:

 Locals hid the victims in the creekbed about 100 yards from the ambush. 

== Fugitive from justice ==
Hardin knew that he would be arrested if he returned home. As a fugitive, he initially traveled with outlaw Frank Polk in the Pisgah area of Navarro County, Texas. Polk had killed a man named Tom Brady, and a detachment of soldiers sent from Corsicana, Texas, were pursuing the duo. Hardin escaped, but the soldiers apprehended Polk and jailed him temporarily. Hardin also briefly taught school in Pisgah. While there, he claimed he shot a man&#x27;s eye out to win a bottle of whiskey in a bet. Hardin also claimed that he and his cousin, &quot;Simp&quot; Dixon, encountered a group of soldiers and each killed a man. Allegedly, Hardin killed a black man in Leon County, Texas. On January 5, 1870, Hardin was playing cards with Benjamin Bradley in Towash, Hill County, Texas. Hardin was winning almost every hand, which angered Bradley, who threatened to cut out Hardin&#x27;s liver if he won again. Bradley drew a knife and a six-shooter. Hardin said he was unarmed and excused himself but claimed that later that night, Bradley came looking for him. Bradley allegedly fired a shot at Hardin and missed; Hardin drew both his pistols and returned fire, one shot striking Bradley in the head and the other in his chest. Dozens of people saw this fight, and from them there is a good record of how Hardin had used his guns. His holsters were sewn into his vest so that the butts of his pistols pointed inward across his chest. He crossed his arms to draw. Hardin claimed this was the fastest way to draw, and he practiced every day. A man called &quot;Judge Moore&quot;, who held Hardin&#x27;s stakes of money and a pistol, refused to give them up without Bradley&#x27;s consent and later &quot;vanished&quot;. Hardin eventually admitted killing two men in Hill County.

After killing Bradley, Hardin claimed that when a posse of fifteen men came after him, he captured two of them and took a shotgun, two six-shooters, a rifle, and two derringers from his captives. He then ordered the two men to join the other members of the posse at Jim Page&#x27;s and wait for him to come along, stating, &quot;I reckon they are waiting for me yet.&quot;

Later that month, on January 20 in Horn Hill, Limestone County, Texas, Hardin claimed he killed a man in a gunfight after an argument at the circus. Less than a week after this incident, in nearby Kosse, Texas, Hardin was accompanying a prostitute home when they were accosted by her pimp, who demanded money. Hardin threw money on the ground and shot the would-be thief when he bent over to pick it up.

=== Arrest and escape ===
In January 1871, Hardin was arrested for the murder of Waco, Texas, city marshal Laban John Hoffman; however, he denied committing this crime. Following his arrest, he was held temporarily in a log jail in the town of Marshall, awaiting transfer to Waco for trial. While locked up, he bought a revolver from another prisoner. Two Texas state policemen, Captain Edward T. Stakes and an officer named Jim Smalley, were assigned to escort Hardin to Waco for trial. According to Hardin, they tied him on a horse with no saddle for the trip. While making camp along the way, Hardin escaped when Stakes went to procure fodder for the horses. He claims he was left alone with Smalley, who began to taunt and beat the then 17-year-old prisoner with the butt of a pistol. Hardin says he feigned crying and huddled against his pony&#x27;s flank. Hidden by the animal, he pulled out a gun, fatally shot Smalley, and used his horse to escape. Hardin then claimed that while on the run he was &quot;arrested&quot; by three men named Smith, Jones, and Davis; but in Bell County, Texas, he killed all three with their own guns, after they became drunk and careless, and escaped again.

A Texas Historical Marker notes that in the 1870s, Hardin hid out in the vicinity of Pilgrim, Texas. After the Bell County shootings, Hardin found refuge with his cousins, the Clements, who were then living in Gonzales, in south Texas. They suggested he could make money by driving cattle to Kansas as a cowboy. Thinking he could get out of Texas long enough for his pursuers to lose interest, Hardin worked with his cousins, rustling cattle for Jake Johnson and Columbus Carol. Hardin writes that he was made trail boss for the herd. In February 1871, while the herd was being collected for the drive to Kansas, a freedman, Bob King, attempted to cut a beef cow out of the herd. When he refused to obey Hardin&#x27;s demand to stop, Hardin hit him over the head with his pistol. That same month, Hardin may have wounded three Mexicans in an argument over a Three-card Monte card game, pistol-whipping one man over the head, shooting one man in the arm, and shooting the third man in the lung.

In the summer of 1871, while driving cattle on the Chisholm Trail to Abilene, Kansas, Hardin is reputed to have fought Mexican vaqueros and cattle rustlers. Towards the end of the drive, a Mexican herd crowded in behind Hardin&#x27;s and there was some trouble keeping the two herds apart. Hardin exchanged words with the man in charge of the other herd; both men were on horseback. The Mexican fired his gun at Hardin, putting a hole through Hardin&#x27;s hat. Hardin found that his own weapon, a worn-out cap-and-ball pistol with a loose cylinder, would not fire. He dismounted and managed to discharge the gun by steadying the cylinder with one hand and pulling the trigger with the other. He hit the Mexican in the thigh. A truce was declared, and both parties went their separate ways. However, Hardin borrowed a pistol from a friend and went looking for the Mexican, this time fatally shooting him through the head. A firefight between the rival camps ensued. Hardin claimed six vaqueros died in the exchanges (five of them reportedly shot by him), although this claim appears exaggerated—only three Mexican vaqueros were killed. Hardin also claimed to have killed two Indians in separate gunfights on the same cattle drive. The first instance was when an Indian tried to shoot an arrow at him on the South Canadian River. Hardin shot him and then had the body buried to avoid retribution from the man&#x27;s tribe. The second incident, at Bluff Creek, Kansas, occurred when Indians wanted to collect a &quot;tax&quot; on the cattle. Hardin hit over the head an Indian who he claimed had stolen a silver bridle from him. He then forced a war party to flee after he shot a second Indian who had killed a beef cow.

After arriving in Abilene, Hardin claimed that he and a companion named Pain got into an argument in a restaurant with an anti-Texan, which left Pain wounded in one arm and the stranger shot in the mouth by Hardin&#x27;s bullet. Hardin fled Abilene to the Cottonwood Trail.

On July 4, 1871, a Texas trail boss named William Cohron was killed on the Cottonwood Trail ( south of Abilene) by an unnamed Mexican, who &quot;fled south&quot; and was subsequently killed by two cowboys in a Sumner County, Kansas, restaurant on July 20. Hardin not only admitted to being involved in the shooting of the Mexican outlaw but also claimed to have been deputized as a law officer and received a reward from Texas cattlemen for helping to shoot the John Doe killer.

=== Encounters with &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Hickok ===

The Bull&#x27;s Head Tavern, in Abilene, Kansas, had been established as a partnership between ex-lawman Ben Thompson and gambler Phil Coe. The two entrepreneurs had painted a picture of a bull with a large erect penis on the side of their establishment as an advertisement. Citizens complained to town marshal &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Hickok. When Thompson and Coe refused his request to remove the bull, Hickok altered it himself. Infuriated, Thompson tried to incite his new acquaintance, Hardin, by exclaiming to him: &quot;He&#x27;s a damn Yankee. Picks on Rebels, especially Texans, to kill.&quot; Hardin, then under the assumed name &quot;Wesley Clemmons&quot; (but better known to the townspeople by the alias &quot;Little Arkansaw&quot;), seemed to have had respect for Hickok, and replied, &quot;If Bill needs killing why don&#x27;t you kill him yourself?&quot; Later that night, Hardin was confronted by Hickok, who told him that he was wearing guns in violation of town ordinance and ordered him to hand over his guns, which he did but in a quite surprising way: Hardin reached down, picked his revolvers up from the holsters, and handed the guns to Wild Bill butts forward, then swiftly rolled them over in his hands and suddenly Wild Bill was staring right into their muzzles. However, both men did back down. Hickok had no knowledge that Hardin was a wanted man, and he advised Hardin to avoid problems while in Abilene.

Hardin met up with Hickok again while on a cattle drive in August 1871. This time, Hickok allowed Hardin to carry his pistols into town—something he had never allowed others to do. For his part, Hardin (still using his alias) was fascinated by Wild Bill and reveled in being seen on intimate terms with such a celebrated gunfighter. Hardin alleged that when his cousin, Mannen Clements, was jailed for the killing of two cowhands (Joe and Dolph Shadden) in July 1871, Hickok—at Hardin&#x27;s request—arranged for his escape.

=== Kills snoring man ===
Soon afterwards, on August 6, 1871, Hardin, his cousin Gip Clements, and a rancher friend named Charles Couger put up for the night at the American House Hotel after an evening of gambling. Clements and Hardin shared one room, with Couger in the adjacent room. All three had been drinking heavily. Sometime during the evening, Hardin was awakened by loud snoring coming from Couger&#x27;s room. He first shouted several times for the man to &quot;rollover&quot; and then, irritated by the lack of response, drunkenly fired several bullets through the shared wall, in an apparent effort to awaken him. Couger was hit in the heart by one of the bullets as he lay in bed and was killed instantly. Although Hardin may not have intended to kill Couger, he had violated an ordinance prohibiting firing a gun within the city limits. Half-dressed and still drunk, he and Clements exited through a second-story window onto the roof of the hotel. He saw Hickok arrive with four policemen. &quot;Now, I believed,&quot; Hardin wrote, &quot;that if Wild Bill found me in a defenseless condition he would take no explanation, but would kill me to add to his reputation.&quot; A newspaper reported, &quot;A man was killed in his bed at a hotel in Abilene, Monday night, by a desperado called ″Arkansas″. The murderer escaped. This was his sixth murder.&quot; (&quot;Monday night&quot;, as reported by the newspaper, would have been August 7, 1871, not August 6.) Hardin leapt from the roof into the street and hid in a haystack for the rest of the night. He then stole a horse and rode to a cow camp 35 miles outside town. Hardin claimed he ambushed lawman Tom Carson and two other deputies there. According to Hardin, he did not kill them but forced them to remove all their clothing and walk back to Abilene. The next day, Hardin left for Texas, never to return to Abilene.

The incident earned Hardin a reputation as a man &quot;so mean, he once shot a man for snoring&quot;. Years later, Hardin made a casual reference to the episode: &quot;They tell lots of lies about me,&quot; he complained. &quot;They say I killed six or seven men for snoring. Well, it ain&#x27;t true. I only killed one man for snoring.&quot; Later, in his contradictory 1896 autobiography, Hardin completely omitted the &quot;snoring man&quot; from the story, and he related not only a wrong date (July 7 instead of August 6) but claimed the shooting was a case of self-defense, saying that the man he killed had first tried to stab him with a dirk and was a burglar who tried to make off with his pants.

=== Gunfights 1871–1872 ===
Following his escape, Hardin claimed to have been involved in the following gunfights:
* On October 6, 1871, Hardin was involved in a gunfight with two Texas Special Policemen, two freedmen, privates Green Paramore and John Lackey, during which Paramore was killed and Lackey wounded. 
* After October 1871, a black posse from Austin, Texas, came after him for killing Paramore but said that they returned &quot;sadder and wiser&quot; after he ambushed and killed three of them.
* In May 1872, about 45 miles outside Corpus Christi, Texas, after he was followed by two Mexicans, he shot one off his horse while the other &quot;quit the fight.&quot;
* On June 19, 1872, Hardin was involved in a gunfight in Willis, Texas.
* On July 26, 1872, Hardin wounded Texas state policeman Sonny Speights in the arm with a derringer pistol, in Hemphill, Texas.

=== Sutton–Taylor feud ===
In early 1872, Hardin was in south–central Texas, in the area around Gonzales County. It was about this time that Hardin married Jane Bowen and started to keep regular company with her brother, cattle rustler Robert Bowen. While in the area, he also renewed his acquaintance with some of his cousins who were allied with a local family, the Taylors, who had been feuding with the rival Sutton faction for several years.

On August 7, 1872, Hardin was wounded by a shotgun blast in a gambling dispute at the Gates Saloon in Trinity, Texas. He was shot by Phil Sublett, who had lost money to him in a poker game. Two buckshot pellets penetrated Hardin&#x27;s kidney and for a time it looked as if he would die.

While recuperating from his wounds, Hardin decided he wanted to settle down. After surrendering to Sheriff Reagan (brother of John Henninger Reagan) of Cherokee County, Texas, he was wounded in the right knee by an accidental gunshot from a nervous deputy. Hardin made a sick-bed surrender to authorities, handing over his guns to Sheriff Reagan and asking to be tried for his past crimes in order &quot;to clear the slate&quot;. However, when Hardin learned of how many murders Reagan was going to charge him with, he changed his mind. A relative smuggled a hacksaw to Hardin, who escaped after cutting through the bars of a prison window. In November 1872, Hardin escaped from the Gonzales County, Texas, jail despite a guard of six men; a $100 reward was offered for his arrest.

On May 15, 1873, Jim Cox and Jake Christman were killed by the Taylor faction at Tumlinson Creek. Hardin, having by then recovered from the injuries sustained in Sublett&#x27;s attack, admitted that there were reports that he had led the fights in which these men were killed but would neither confirm nor deny his involvement: &quot;...as I have never pleaded to that case, I will at this time have little to say...&quot;

Hardin&#x27;s main notoriety in the Sutton–Taylor feud came from his part in the killing of two lawmen known to be Sutton family allies. On July 18, 1873 in Cuero, Texas, Hardin killed DeWitt County Deputy Sheriff J.B. Morgan, who served under County Sheriff Jack Helm (a former captain in the Texas State Police and leader of the Sutton force at that time). Later that day, Hardin killed Helm in the town square of Albuquerque, Texas. On the run again in June 1873, Hardin assisted in the escape of his brother-in-law, Joshua Bowen, from the Gonzales County, Texas, jail where he was imprisoned on an 1872 murder charge. Allegedly, Hardin was also involved in this killing of Thomas Holderman.

On March 11, 1874, the Sutton–Taylor feud intensified when Jim and Bill Taylor gunned down Billy Sutton and Gabriel Slaughter as they waited on a steamboat platform in Indianola, Texas. Tired of the feuding, the two were planning to leave the area for good. Hardin admitted that he and his brother Joseph had been involved (along with both Taylors) in the killings.

After a brief visit to Florida—where he claimed to have been involved in three incidents against Negroes, including a lynching—Hardin met with his wife, Jane, and their young daughter, with whom he had relocated under the assumed name &quot;Swain&quot;. Hardin then met up with his &quot;gang&quot; on May 26, 1874, in a Comanche, Texas, saloon to celebrate his 21st birthday. Hardin spotted Brown County Deputy Sheriff Charles Webb entering the premises. He asked Webb if he had come to arrest him. When Webb replied he had not, Hardin invited him into the hotel for a drink. As Webb followed him inside, Hardin claimed Webb drew his gun. One of Hardin&#x27;s men yelled out a warning, and in the ensuing gunfight, Webb was shot dead. It was reported at the time that Webb was shot as he was pulling out an arrest warrant for one of Hardin&#x27;s group. Two of Hardin&#x27;s accomplices in the shooting were cousin Bud Dixon and Jim Taylor.

The death of the popular Webb resulted in the quick formation of a lynch mob. Hardin&#x27;s parents and wife were taken into protective custody, while his brother Joe and two cousins, brothers Bud and Tom Dixon, were arrested on outstanding warrants. A group of local men broke into the jail in July 1874 and hanged Joe and the two Dixon boys. After this, Hardin and Jim Taylor parted ways for good. Hardin would claim that he twice drove away men connected to the feud who had come after him, killing a man in each encounter. On November 18, 1875, the leader of the Suttons, ex-Cuero, Texas, town marshal Reuben Brown was shot and killed by five men in Cuero along with a negro named Tom Freeman, with another negro being wounded. In his autobiography, Hardin made only two references to Brown: that &quot;Rube&quot; Brown had arrested William Taylor before sending him to Galveston, Texas, for trial, and that Brown had been among the leaders of a Sutton &quot;posse&quot; that had been out to &quot;get&quot; him in Gonzales County, Texas. It is not known if Hardin was directly or indirectly involved in the killing of Reuben Brown, as he makes no further mention of the incident in his life story.

=== Captured and tried ===
On January 20, 1875, the Texas Legislature authorized Governor Richard B. Hubbard to offer a $4,000 reward for Hardin&#x27;s arrest. An undercover Texas Ranger named Jack Duncan intercepted a letter sent to Hardin&#x27;s father-in-law by Hardin&#x27;s brother-in-law, Joshua Robert &quot;Brown&quot; Bowen. The letter mentioned that Hardin was hiding out at a lumber yard on the Alabama-Florida border using the name &quot;John &quot;(or James)&quot; W. Swain&quot;. In his autobiography, Hardin admitted that he had &quot;adopted&quot; this alias from Brenham, Texas, Town Marshal Henry Swain, who had married a cousin of Hardin&#x27;s named Molly Parks.

In March 1876, Hardin wounded a man, in Florida, who had tried to mediate a quarrel between him and another man. In November 1876, in Mobile, Alabama, Hardin was arrested briefly for having marked cards. In mid-1877, two former slaves of his father&#x27;s, &quot;Jake&quot; Menzel and Robert Borup tried to capture Hardin in Gainesville, Florida. Hardin killed one and blinded the other.

On August 24, 1877, Rangers and local authorities confronted Hardin on a train in Pensacola, Florida. He attempted to draw a .44 Colt cap-and-ball pistol but it got caught up in his suspenders. The officers knocked Hardin unconscious. They arrested two of his companions, and Ranger John B. Armstrong killed a third, a man named Mann, who had a pistol in his hand. Hardin claimed that he was captured while smoking his pipe and that Duncan found Hardin&#x27;s pistol under his shirt only after his arrest.

== Trial and imprisonment ==
Hardin was tried for Webb&#x27;s killing, and on June 5, 1878, was sentenced to serve 25 years in Huntsville Prison. In 1879, Hardin and 50 other convicts were stopped within hours of successfully tunneling into the prison armory. Hardin made several attempts to escape. On February 14, 1892, during his prison term, he was convicted of another manslaughter charge for the earlier shooting of J.B. Morgan and given a two-year sentence to be served concurrently with his unexpired 25-year sentence.

Hardin eventually adapted to prison life. While there, he read theological books, becoming the superintendent of the prison Sunday School, and studied law. He was plagued by recurring poor health, especially when the wound he had received from Sublett became re-infected in 1883, causing him to be bedridden for almost two years. In 1892, Hardin was described as tall and , with a fair complexion, hazel eyes, dark hair, and wound scars on his right knee, left thigh, right side, hip, elbow, shoulder, and back. On November 6, 1892, during Hardin&#x27;s stay in prison, his first wife, Jane, died.

While in prison, he wrote an autobiography. He was well known for fabricating or wildly exaggerating stories about his life. He claimed credit for many murders that cannot be corroborated. Hardin wrote that he was first exposed to violence in 1861 when he saw a man named Turner Evans stabbed by John Ruff. Evans died of his injuries and Ruff was jailed. Hardin wrote, &quot;... Readers you see what drink and passion will do. If you wish to be successful in life, be temperate and control your passions; if you don&#x27;t, ruin and death is the result.&quot;

== After prison ==
On February 17, 1894, Hardin was released from prison, having served seventeen years of his twenty-five-year sentence. He was forty years old when he returned to Gonzales, Texas. Later that year, on March 16, Hardin was pardoned, and, on July 21, he passed the state&#x27;s bar examination, obtaining his license to practice law. According to a newspaper article in 1900, shortly after being released from prison, Hardin committed negligent homicide when he made a $5 bet that he could &quot;at the first shot&quot; knock a Mexican man off the soapbox on which the man was &quot;sunning&quot; himself, winning the bet and leaving the man dead from the fall and not the gunshot.

On January 9, 1895, Hardin married a 15-year-old girl named Callie Lewis. The marriage ended quickly, although it was never legally dissolved. Afterward, Hardin moved to El Paso, Texas.

== Death ==
An El Paso lawman, John Selman Jr., arrested Hardin&#x27;s acquaintance and part-time prostitute, the &quot;widow&quot; M&#x27;Rose (or Mroz), for &quot;brandishing a gun in public&quot;. Hardin confronted Selman and the two men argued. Some accounts state that Hardin pistol-whipped the younger man. Selman&#x27;s 56-year-old father, Constable John Selman Sr. (himself a notorious gunman and former outlaw), approached Hardin on the afternoon of August 19, 1895, and the two men exchanged heated words.

That night, Hardin went to the Acme Saloon where he began playing dice; his last words were &quot;Four Sixes to Beat&quot;. Shortly before midnight, Selman Sr. entered the saloon, walked up to Hardin from behind, and shot him in the head, killing him instantly. As Hardin lay on the floor, Selman fired three more shots into him. Hardin was buried the following day in Concordia Cemetery, in El Paso.

Selman Sr. was arrested for murder and stood trial. He claimed self-defense, stating that he witnessed Hardin attempting to draw his pistol upon seeing him enter the saloon, and a hung jury resulted in his being released on bond, pending a retrial. However, before the retrial could be organized Selman was killed in a shootout with US Marshal George Scarborough on April 6, 1896, during an argument following a card game.

== Reburial controversy ==
A century later, on August 27, 1995, there was a confrontation between two groups at the site of Hardin&#x27;s grave. One group, representing several of Hardin&#x27;s great-grandchildren, sought to relocate his body to Nixon, Texas, to be interred next to the grave of his first wife, Jane. The other group, consisting of locals from El Paso, sought to prevent the move. At the cemetery, the group representing Hardin&#x27;s descendants presented a disinterment permit for the body, while the El Pasoans presented a court order prohibiting its removal. Both sides accused the other parties of seeking the tourist revenue generated by the location of the body. A subsequent lawsuit ruled in favor of keeping the body in El Paso.

== Known contacts with the law ==
Hardin had numerous confirmed clashes with the law:
* January 9, 1871: Arrested by Constable E.T. Stakes and 12 citizens in Harrison County, Texas, on a charge of four murders and one horse theft. It is alleged that Hardin was an accomplice in the killing of ex-Texas State Policeman and Waco Texas Town Marshal Laban John Hoffman on January 6, 1871. Hardin claimed not to have been involved in Hoffman&#x27;s murder.
* January 22, 1871: Hardin killed Texas State Police officer Jim Smalley and escaped. Up to November 13, 1872, the Grand Jury of Freestone County, Texas had not filed an indictment against Hardin for Smalley&#x27;s killing.
* August 6, 1871: In Abilene, Dickinson County, Kansas, Charles Couger was killed in the American House Hotel. Hardin, aka &quot;Wesley Clemens&quot;, was found guilty by a coroner&#x27;s jury of the killing.

== Unconfirmed claims ==
Hardin&#x27;s autobiography is filled with statements which can either not be confirmed independently from his book, or differ wildly from the historical record:
* Hardin claimed that after killing Maje, he shot three Union soldiers of the U.S. 4th Cavalry Regiment at a creek crossing at Logallis Prairie (now Nogalus Prairie, Trinity County, Texas). None of the military records name Hardin as a suspect, nor do any facts agree with his claims. Circumstantial evidence is that a murder was committed here, but the names and number of victims are unknown.
*In Pisgah, Texas Hardin claimed he shot a man&#x27;s eye out to win a bottle of whiskey in a bet. 
* Hardin said he shot one of the two soldiers killed in 1869 in &quot;Richland Bottom&quot;, the other having been shot by his cousin, Simpson &quot;Simp&quot; Dixson, a member of the Ku Klux Klan (and the Bob Lee outlaw gang) who hated Union soldiers. Records indicate that a Sgt. J.F. Leonard of Company B, 6th U.S. Cavalry, was wounded at Livingston, Texas, on May 7, 1869. &quot;Simp&quot; Dixson/Dickson was killed by US soldiers In February 1870.
*Allegedly, Hardin killed a black man in Leon County, Texas.
* In January 1870, Hardin claimed he killed a circus hand at Horn Hill, Texas. A contemporary newspaper account did report a fight in Union Hill, Texas, between circus &quot;canvasmen&quot; and &quot;roughs&quot; who tried to get in without paying, although the outcome did not conclude the way Hardin claimed it did.
* A few days later, Hardin killed a man in Kosse, Texas; there are no contemporary newspapers to confirm this shooting. Author Charles Adkins—in his 1970 book &quot;Texas, Guns &amp; History&quot;—claimed the victim was named Alan Comstock; however he did not furnish any references to back up his claim.
* Hardin claimed that, following his January 1871 escape from Stakes and Smalley, he killed a Mr. Smith, a Mr. Jones, and a Mr. Davis in Bell County, Texas. No contemporary newspaper accounts from Bell County confirm these additional killings.
*In February 1871, Hardin claimed that a freedman, named Bob King, attempted to cut a beef cow out of the herd. When he refused to obey Hardin&#x27;s demand to stop, Hardin hit him over the head with his pistol. That same month, Hardin claimed to have been involved in a shooting incident in which he wounded three Mexicans in an argument over a Three-card Monte card game, pistol-whipping one man over the head, shooting one man in the arm, and shooting the third man in the lung.
* Hardin made the claim to have outdrawn &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Hickok. No contemporary newspaper accounts confirm this, but another report suggests that it was Hickok who made Hardin put up his guns.
* Another claim was that he killed a man in Abilene, Kansas, in the summer of 1871. No contemporary newspaper accounts with evidence of such a killing exist, although a 1924 account does report a saloon shooting in some respects similar to Hardin&#x27;s version.
*As noted above, Hardin claimed to have captured Abilene law officer Tom Carson and other officers and humiliated them sans clothing. Although Carson was a law officer, he did not have any interactions with Hardin
* Hardin claimed that after killing Green Paramore in October 1871, he forced an African-American posse to flee after killing three of them. There are no contemporary accounts to confirm this claim.
* At an unknown date in May 1872, Hardin claimed that 45 miles outside Corpus Christie, Texas, he was followed by two Mexicans; that he killed one and the other fled.
* Hardin claimed that on June 19, 1872, in Willis, Texas, some men tried to arrest him for carrying a pistol, &quot;... but they got the contents instead&quot;. Hardin was wounded in a gunfight around this time, but records indicate the fight occurred with just one other man.
* After being wounded by Sublett in August 1872, Hardin claimed that in September he either killed or drove off one or two members of the Texas State Police in Trinity, Texas. Hardin gave different versions of the event at different times. Although during his career he had killed two and wounded two of the Texas State policemen, these shootings did not occur in Trinity County. 
* September 1873, in Brooksville, Hernando County, Florida, a former slave named Allen May was shot and killed. A Savannah newspaper claimed the killer was John Wesley Hardin on a cattle drive in central Florida but offered no proof Hardin was involved.
* In May 1874, while in Gainesville, Florida, Hardin confessed to having knocked down a black man and shooting another during a disturbance outside the Alachua County jail. A black prisoner named &quot;Eli&quot;, was lynched when the jail was burned down by a mob. Hardin claimed to have been part of the mob. No contemporary newspaper accounts support this, except one suggesting that the first Alachua County jail building suffered a &quot;demise&quot;.
* Hardin claimed that on July 1, 1874, he drove off 17 Texas Rangers who had been trailing him, and killed one of them. This alleged shooting happened after a triple lynching of Hardin&#x27;s cousin and two ranch hands during the Sutton–Taylor Feud. He also claimed to have driven off another group of men after killing one of them. There are no contemporary reports to confirm these stories. However, on June 1, 1874, a Texas Ranger&#x27;s company did kill Hardin&#x27;s cousins, Alexander Barekman and Alexander Anderson, in a gunfight and claimed to have wounded Hardin as well. Hardin wrote about his cousins&#x27; killings but does not confirm that he was wounded at all, and claimed to have heard about their deaths later.
* Later, Hardin and Mac Young were supposedly stopped near Bellville, Texas, by a posse under Sheriff Charles Langhammer of Austin on suspicion of being horse thieves. Hardin pulled his guns on Langhammer but did not shoot him, fleeing instead; Young was arrested and fined $100 for having a concealed pistol.
* Hardin claimed to have been involved in the killing of two Pinkerton agents on the Florida–Georgia border sometime between April and November 1876, after a gunfight with a &quot;Pinkerton Gang&quot; who had been tracking him from Jacksonville, Florida. This confrontation is pure fiction, as the Pinkerton Detective Agency never pursued Hardin. However, in March 1876 it was alleged Hardin, &quot;Swain&quot;, who had wounded W.C. Overbey, who had tried to act as a mediator between Hardin and another person.
* Hardin claimed that in a saloon on election night in November 1876, he and a companion, Jacksonville policeman Gus Kennedy, were involved in a gunfight with Mobile policemen in which one person was wounded and two killed. He further claims that he and Kennedy were arrested and later released. This appears to be another case of an exaggerated encounter. Hardin and Kennedy were simply arrested and driven out of town for cheating at cards. Again Hardin&#x27;s version does not fit with contemporary records which tell that nobody was killed and the only person injured was a Mobile policeman Sgt Ryan who was shot in the arm.
* Hardin claimed to have met two notorious fellow outlaws during his life: in 1870, he supposedly gambled with Bill Longley. It is possible they met after both were sentenced for their crimes, Hardin receiving 25 years and Longley execution. Longley, who boasted of having killed as many men as Hardin, was outraged at the different degrees of sentencing. After being sentenced in September 1878, Hardin supposedly met Johnny Ringo, a fellow convict, in an Austin, Texas jail; in fact, Ringo had been acquitted and freed in May 1878.

At least three other relatives of Hardin were also killers:
*James &quot;Gip&quot; Hardin—his brother—killed Deputy Sheriff John Turman March 28, 1898, for which he served a jail term
*Emanuel &quot;Mannen&quot; Clements Sr-cousin-is alleged to have killed 2 cowhands in 1871. Clements was killed in a saloon March 29, 1887; ironically his son Mannen Clements Jr was an El Paso Constable/Deputy Sherriff 1894-until 1908; although acquitted of a robbery charge he was no longer a law officer. Just like his father he was killed in a saloon December 29, 1908
*&quot;Deacon&quot; Jim Miller (outlaw)—a cousin by marriage—killed Officer Ben C. Collins August 1, 1906 and was later lynched April 16, 1909
One relation was a law officer killed in the line of duty:
*James Burch killed October 10, 1897

== Legacy ==
The memorable circumstances and the sheer number of Hardin&#x27;s life events, real or exaggerated, made him a legend of the Old West and an icon of American folklore. His autobiography was published posthumously in 1925 by Bandera publisher, historian, and journalist J. Marvin Hunter, who founded both the &quot;Frontier Times&quot; magazine and the Frontier Times Museum.

=== Firearms and effects ===
Hardin&#x27;s weapons of choice, and several of his personal effects, have been well documented and auctioned to private collectors. Court records show that Hardin carried a Colt &quot;Lightning&quot; revolver at the time of his death. He also carried an Elgin watch when he was shot and killed. The revolver and the watch had been presented to Hardin in appreciation for his legal efforts on behalf of Jim Miller at Miller&#x27;s trial for the killing of ex-sheriff George &quot;Bud&quot; Frazer. The Colt, with a .38-caliber &quot; barrel, is nickel-plated, with blued hammer, trigger, and screws. It features mother-of-pearl grips, and the back-strap is hand-engraved &quot;J.B.M. TO J.W.H.&quot;. This gun and its holster were once sold at auction for $168,000. Another Colt revolver (known as a .41-caliber &quot;Thunderer&quot;), which was owned by Hardin and used by him to rob the Gem Saloon, was sold at the same auction for $100,000.

In 2002, an auction house in San Francisco, California, auctioned three lots of John Wesley Hardin&#x27;s personal effects. One lot—containing a deck of his playing cards, a deck of his business cards, and a contemporary newspaper account of his death—sold for $15,250. The bullet that killed Hardin sold for $80,000.

Nixon was born on a farm near St. George, Ontario, the son of a dairy farmer, Henry Nixon, and studied at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Ontario Agricultural College (then affiliated with the university).

He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1919 as a candidate of the United Farmers of Ontario. He served as a Cabinet minister in the government of Premier Ernest C. Drury as Provincial Secretary and Registrar. Following the defeat of the UFO-Labour government in the 1923 election, Nixon sat as a Progressive Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), and became the leader of the small Progressive bloc (as most UFOers now called themselves) after the 1929 election.

Mitchell Hepburn, a farmer and former UFO organizer, became leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, and Nixon led his Progressive remnant into an alliance with Hepburn&#x27;s party. In the 1934 election, Nixon and his followers ran as &quot;Liberal-Progressives&quot;, helping bring the Hepburn to power. He ran and was elected as a Liberal in the 1937 election. 

Nixon resumed his former Cabinet position of Provincial Secretary and Registrar in the Hepburn cabinet and was the senior minister in the government. During World War II, Hepburn clashed with William Lyon Mackenzie King, the Liberal Prime Minister of Canada, arguing that King was not sufficiently prosecuting the war effort, in particular by not introducing conscription (see &quot;Conscription Crisis of 1944&quot;). Hepburn openly supported King&#x27;s rival, Conservative leader Arthur Meighen in a 1942 York South by-election, and seemed to be calling for the defeat of King. This was too much for many Ontario Liberals, who were either King loyalists or feared a rift between the federal and provincial parties. Hepburn was forced to resign on October 21, 1942.

Nixon was widely seen as the &quot;heir apparent,&quot; and had earlier turned down Hepburn&#x27;s offer to recommend that Nixon be appointed Premier, as Nixon insisted the leadership should be the choice of the party, not of Hepburn. However, Hepburn, while resigning as Premier, insisted on remaining as party leader, and simply appointed his ally, Gordon Daniel Conant as the new Premier of Ontario on October 21, 1942. Nixon resigned from the cabinet on October 22, 1942, in opposition to Hepburn&#x27;s refusal to allow a leadership convention to elect a new leader. Conant was forced to resign after only six months due to serious divisions in the party, and a leadership convention was called. Nixon was chosen as Liberal leader, and thus appointed Premier in May 1943, but his government was unable to win the election held three months later, and the Liberals were reduced to third place behind George Drew&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives and Ted Jolliffe&#x27;s Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. Nixon resigned as Liberal leader on December 10, 1944, and nominated Hepburn as the party&#x27;s House Leader (interim leader). Hepburn led to party into the 1945 provincial election.

Harry Nixon remained a Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP)1 until his death in 1961. His son, Robert Nixon succeeded him as MPP, and later became leader of the Liberal Party but never Premier. He served as Treasurer in the Cabinet of David Peterson from 1985 to 1990. Harry Nixon&#x27;s granddaughter (and Robert Nixon&#x27;s daughter) Jane Stewart served as a Cabinet minister in the federal Liberal government of Jean Chrétien.

<doc id="464691" wikidata="Q606393" url="?curid=464691" title="Hi-NRG">
<text>Hi-NRG (pronounced &quot;high energy&quot;) is a genre of uptempo disco or electronic dance music (EDM) that originated during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

As a music genre, typified by its fast tempo, staccato hi-hat rhythms (and the four-on-the-floor pattern), reverberated &quot;intense&quot; vocals and &quot;pulsating&quot; octave basslines, it was particularly influential on the disco scene.

== Characteristics ==
Whether hi-NRG is more rock-oriented than standard disco music is a matter of opinion. Hi-NRG can be heavily synthesized but it is not a prerequisite, and whether it is devoid of &quot;funkiness&quot; is, again, in the ear of the beholder. Certainly, many artists perform their vocals in R&amp;B and soul styles on hi-NRG tracks.
 The genre&#x27;s tempo ranges between 120 and 140 beats per minute. The tempos cited here do not represent the full range of beats (BPM) of hi-NRG tracks; rather the tempos are retrieved from one source which is not an expert musical reference, but a sociological study of dance culture. Lyrics tend to be overtly camp, kitschy, tongue-in-cheek, sexually suggestive with double entendres but also occasionally sentimental or maudlin. 

The sound of high energy dance tracks, particularly electronic dance or disco, is immediately identifiable by its iconic basslines, pioneered by producer Giorgio Moroder, often programmed in repeating bass sequences, particularly 16th notes, which is characteristic of the hi-NRG electronic dance sound as in &quot;I Feel Love&quot; performed by Donna Summer and produced by Moroder.
The rhythm is characterized by an energetic, staccato, sequenced synthesizer sound of octave basslines or/and where the bass often takes the place of the hi-hat, alternating a more resonant note with a dampened note to signify the tempo of the record. There is also often heavy use of the clap sound found on drum machines.

One form of hi-NRG, as performed by Megatone Records artists and Ian Levine, is any uptempo disco and dance music, whether containing octave basslines or not, that often features covers of &quot;classic&quot; Motown hits (Boys Town Gang) and torch songs, and is often &quot;theatrical&quot; in performance, featuring female (and male) musicians with facetious diva personas and male musicians sometimes in &quot;drag&quot; (Sylvester, Divine), cabarets/musical theater (Vicki Sue Robinson, Sharon Redd). This style, that Stock Aitken Waterman were influenced by, had a large cult following among gay club-goers in the 1980s, especially San Franciscan black and white gay men.

A second form, a precursor of Italian/Japanese &quot;Eurobeat&quot;, with influences of techno and early Chicago house, primarily focuses on its characteristic sequenced &quot;octave-jumping basslines&quot; above anything else and in this form hi-NRG managed to surge into the mainstream with Stacey Q, Kim Wilde, and Laura Branigan. The octave basslines are also found in electroclash and in both cases may be traced to synth-pop and even further back to Giorgio Moroder (&quot;I Feel Love&quot;).

== Terminology ==
Donna Summer was interviewed about her single &quot;I Feel Love&quot;, which was a mostly electronic, relatively high-tempo Euro disco song without a strong funk component. In the interview, she said &quot;this song became a hit because it has a high-energy vibe&quot;. Following that interview, the description &quot;high-energy&quot; was increasingly applied to high-tempo disco music, especially songs dominated by electronic timbres. The tempo threshold for high-energy disco was around 130 to 140 BPM. In the 1980s, the term &quot;high-energy&quot; was stylized as &quot;hi-NRG&quot;. Eurobeat, dance-pop and freestyle artists such as Shannon, Stock Aitken &amp; Waterman, Taylor Dayne, Freeez and Michael Sembello were also labeled as &quot;hi-NRG&quot; when sold in the United States.

In the 1980s, &quot;hi-NRG&quot; referred not just to any high-tempo disco/dance music, but to a specific genre, only somewhat disco-like.

Ian Levine, a hi-NRG DJ, the in-house DJ at London&#x27;s Heaven nightclub in its early years and subsequently a record producer, defines hi-NRG as &quot;melodic, straightforward dance music that&#x27;s not too funky.&quot; Music journalist Simon Reynolds adds &quot;The nonfunkiness was crucial. Slamming rather than swinging, hi-NRG&#x27;s white European feel was accentuated by butt-bumping bass twangs at the end of each bar.&quot;

== History ==
High-tempo disco music dates back to the mid-1970s. The first hi-NRG song was Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;I Feel Love&quot; from 1977. Other early examples include several British disco songs by Biddu and Patrick Hernandez (&quot;Born to Be Alive&quot;) in 1979.

In the early 1980s, high energy music found moderate mainstream popularity in Europe; while opposing both Euro disco and electro on the dance scene, it became mainstream in the gay community in the United States. Hi-NRG was reliant on technology and was all about &quot;unfeasibly athletic dancing, bionic sex, and superhuman stamina&quot;. The freedom associated with it seemed to be embodied by a literal escape from human embodiment, and synchrony with technology. However, this was generally limited to the bodies of men as evidenced by songs titled &quot;Menergy&quot;, and &quot;So Many Men, So Little Time&quot;. Producers such as Bobby Orlando and Patrick Cowley created &quot;an aural fantasy of a futuristic club populated entirely by Tom of Finland studs.&quot;

During the same period, a genre of music styled as &quot;hi-NRG&quot; (EDM) became popular in Canada and the UK. The most popular groups of this style are Trans-X and Lime. The genre is also closely related to space disco; bands of this genre include Koto, Laserdance, and Cerrone. The hi-NRG sound also influenced techno and house music.

=== Commercial success ===
In 1983 in the UK, music magazine &quot;Record Mirror&quot; began publishing a weekly hi-NRG chart. The style entered the British mainstream, with hits on the UK pop and dance charts (followed by the US dance charts), such as Hazell Dean&#x27;s &quot;Searchin&#x27; (I Gotta Find a Man)&quot; and Evelyn Thomas&#x27;s &quot;High Energy&quot;.

In the mid-1980s, hi-NRG producers in the dance and pop charts included Ian Levine and Stock Aitken Waterman, both of whom worked with many different artists. Stock Aitken Waterman had two of the most successful hi-NRG singles ever with their productions of Dead or Alive&#x27;s &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot; (UK #1, CAN #1, US #11 in 1985) and Bananarama&#x27;s &quot;Venus&quot; (US #1, CAN #1, UK #8 in 1986). They also brought the genre full-circle, in a sense, by writing and producing Donna Summer&#x27;s 1989 hit &quot;This Time I Know It&#x27;s for Real&quot; (UK #3, CAN #7, US #7).

American music magazine &quot;Dance Music Report&quot; published hi-NRG charts (and related industry news) in the mid- to late 1980s, as the genre reached its peak. By 1990, however, techno and rave music had superseded hi-NRG in popularity in many dance clubs. Despite this, hi-NRG music is still being produced and played in various forms, including many remixed versions of mainstream pop hits, some with re-recorded vocals. Later in the 1990s, nu-NRG music, a form of trance music evolved from hi-NRG, was born.
