<text>Abu Dhabi TV () is an Emirates-based television channel that was originally launched in 1969. It broadcasts content from Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, and is owned by Abu Dhabi Media.

Abu Dhabi TV is managed by the Abu Dhabi Media. It is managed through its previous attachment to the Ministry of Information and Culture since 1999 and current attachment to Abu Dhabi Media since February 2006, when the ministry was scrapped.

Abu Dhabi TV presents news bulletins every three hours. Abu Dhabi TV broadcasts content throughout the Arab World, North America, Europe, South America, and Australia.

== History and re-branding ==

Abu Dhabi Television started grayscale broadcasts on 4 August 1969 using equipment provided by British company Thomson Television International, later adopting the PAL format for color broadcasting on 4 December 1974. The station was only carried terrestrially in the United Arab Emirates for its first 23 years on the air. At launch, it only had one transmitter in Abu Dhabi proper on VHF channel 5, followed by the installation of a relay station at Al Ain in October 1971 on channel 7. Around this time, the network signed on at 6:30pm and signed off at midnight. By 1976, the channel now opened at 6pm. The Abu Dhabi TV satellite channel began regular broadcasts on 15 November 1992 on Arabsat A1; broadcasts were later transferred to Arabsat A2. The network also began to be carried through the entire Arabian Peninsula at that time.

The network was rebranded on 30 January 2000 as a service aimed at the Arabic-speaking diaspora. Under this format, the channel began carrying a wide range of news programs, as well as entertainment programs catered to Arabic audiences; as a result, it began to become competitive against rival networks MBC and Dubai TV. One of the network&#x27;s most popular programs was the game show &quot;Waznak Dahab&quot;; the program premiered on 16 September 2002 and was canceled in early 2003 due to the invasion of Iraq by the United States, which resulted in the beginning of the Iraq War.

On 6 October 2008, Abu Dhabi TV (then-renamed &quot;Abu Dhabi Al Oula&quot;) was re-branded with a new logo, theme and new original programming content. This re-branding involved the launches of a website involving catch-ups of television programs and a 1080i high definition broadcast channel; which then featured bespoke idents in contrast to the standard-definition cast. The new themes were produced by graphic designer Lambie Nairn and the soundtrack was made by David Lowe, who produced the famous BBC News themes. The rebrand also involved the launch of &#x27;Abu Dhabi Sports&#x27;, a group of eight sister channels (broadcast in either Arabic or English) with the inclusion of &#x27;EDGE Sports&#x27; and &#x27;YAS Sports&#x27;; all of which are currently broadcast 24/7.

In the same year, President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan issued a decree ordering Abu Dhabi TV to be established as a public joint-stock company that is wholly owned by the government of Abu Dhabi.

In 2009, Abu Dhabi Media relaunched and rebranded &#x27;Emirates TV&#x27; as &#x27;Abu Dhabi Al Emarat&#x27; after acquiring the network in 2007. Additionally, a UAE-based channel of National Geographic was launched on 1 July of the same year.

On 5 April 2010, the sister channel Abu Dhabi Drama was launched, offering free-to-air broadcasts of drama and soap opera television programs broadcast 24/7 without advertisement breaks. On 13 February 2012, Abu Dhabi TV shut down its analogue broadcasts on terrestrial television and began broadcasting solely in high definition while existing standard definition casts were down-converted.

On 22 March 2015, the network was once again rebranded back to the &#x27;Abu Dhabi TV&#x27; name with a brand new logo and identity.

On 19 February 2020, Abu Dhabi TV unveiled its new logo after 5 years in use. It is now co-owned by the National Geographic Society/The Walt Disney Company &amp; Abu Dhabi Media Company. The latter is also responsible for launching the Arabic version of the &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine.

On 19 September 2023, Abu Dhabi TV unveiled its new logo after three years of the old one.

<text>Peter Royce Brough (26 February 1916 – 3 June 1999) was an English radio ventriloquist who became a well-known name to audiences in the 1950s. He is associated with his puppet Archie Andrews.

==Early life and career==
Peter Royce Brough was born on 26 February 1916 in Ealing, west London. His father, Arthur, was a ventriloquist and a frequent performer on the variety stages around London. Brough senior gave up performing in the early 1920s and concentrated on a textile business. Peter left school at 15 and worked for a Bayswater department store called Whiteleys, first as an errand boy and later as a counter salesman. He emulated his father by developing his ventriloquist skills, which he continued to practise whilst working at Whiteleys. 
Early press reports show Brough entertaining the patients at Acton hospital on Christmas Day, 1935. He continued entertaining at clubs and at concerts in the Acton area and by 1939 he was becoming a regular on the variety stage. His stage performances increased and in 1941 he was described as “England&#x27;s Most Successful Young Ventriloquist”. He acted as a compere in the 1940 film &quot;Cavalcade of Variety&quot; featuring Billy Cotton and his band.

==Radio days==
Brough began his radio career in 1944 in ventriloquism but in 1950 he debuted Archie, a mischievous child who domineered his mentor. Archie&#x27;s chief characteristics were his Savile Row-tailored blazers and manic eyes. Archie followed in the tradition of the American ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his dummy Charlie McCarthy.

His radio series based around the character – &quot;Educating Archie&quot; – featured in support the likes of Dick Emery, Freddie Sales, Benny Hill, Tony Hancock, Hattie Jacques, Bruce Forsyth, Harry Secombe, Max Bygraves, Beryl Reid and even a young Julie Andrews as the girlfriend of Archie; Eric Sykes was one of the series&#x27; main writers in the early 1950s. The show often averaged 15 million listeners, and a fan club had 250,000 members.

Brough published his autobiography &quot;Educating Archie&quot; in 1955.

==TV work==
Because of the success of his radio show, Brough made his debut on television in 1956 in the BBC sitcom &quot;Here&#x27;s Archie&quot; which co-starred Irene Handl and Ronald Chesney. The show was written by the latter and Ronald Wolfe, who would later team up on British sitcoms &quot;The Rag Trade&quot; and &quot;On the Buses&quot;.

Two years later, Brough was on ITV in &quot;Educating Archie&quot;, utilising the same team as before, although Marty Feldman took some of the writing credit as well. The TV appearances exposed his limitations as a ventriloquist, as his lips were frequently seen to move and resulted in his use of a cigar to mask such movements. In later years a critic remarked, &quot;Ventriloquism on the radio - I could have done that.&quot;

By 1961, Brough decided to retire Archie following the death of his father, also a ventriloquist, and he then took over the family&#x27;s textile and menswear business. His TV appearances were sporadic from then on. He died on 3 June 1999 and was buried in Maldon cemetery in Essex.

In November 2005, the original Archie Andrews doll was sold at auction in Taunton for £34,000.

==Personal life and death==
Brough married twice. His first marriage was in 1940, to Peggy Franklin. The pair had a son and a daughter, however the marriage ended in divorce. His second marriage was to Elizabeth Chantler, who died in 1994. The couple had one son and one daughter. In 1948 his sister, Edna Brough, married TV and film star Ernest Butcher, in Wood Green, London.

Brough&#x27;s son, Chris Brough, became a record producer and married to the singer, actress and TV presenter Ayshea Brough in the 1970s. His daughter, Romey Brough, is an internationally collected artist with work in the Tate Gallery Archive.

Brough died on 3 June 1999, aged 83 in Northwood, London.

<text>Rachel&#x27;s was an American chamber music group that formed in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1991. Former Rodan guitarist Jason Noble played music individually and referred to himself as Rachel&#x27;s but then began collaborating with core members violist Christian Frederickson and pianist Rachel Grimes. The group&#x27;s work was strongly influenced by classical music, particularly inspired by the minimalist music of the late 20th century, and its compositions reflect this. While the trio formed the core part of the band, the group&#x27;s recordings and performances featured a varying ensemble of musicians, who played a range of string instruments (including viola and cello) in combination with piano, guitars, electric bass guitar, and a drum set that included a large orchestral bass drum. A key influence on the music of Rachel&#x27;s was the music of the English composer Michael Nyman, whose music the group&#x27;s work resembles in both instrumentation and compositional style.

A profile of the band is included in the book &quot;Second-Hand Stories: 15 Portraits of Louisville&quot; by Michael L. Jones.

Noble died of cancer on August 4, 2012, and Edward Grimes died on March 25, 2017.

<text>Rybinsk Reservoir (, ), informally called the Rybinsk Sea, is a water reservoir on the Volga River and its tributaries the Sheksna and Mologa, formed by Rybinsk Hydroelectric Station dam, located in the Tver, Vologda, and Yaroslavl Oblasts. At the time of its construction, it was the largest man-made body of water on Earth. It is the northernmost point of the Volga. The Volga–Baltic Waterway starts from there. The principal ports are Cherepovets in Vologda Oblast and Vesyegonsk in Tver Oblast.

The construction of the dam in Rybinsk started in 1935. The filling of the reservoir started on April 14, 1941, and continued until 1947. Some 150,000 people had to be resettled elsewhere, and the historic town of Mologa in Yaroslavl Oblast along with 663 villages completely disappeared under water. Today the dam is less important for hydroelectric power supply (output is 346 MW) than it used to be.

<text>Aberdeen was an American twee pop group.

==History==
The band formed in 1992 and in 1994 released two singles on the seminal British label Sarah Records; they were one of the only American acts on Sarah. Aberdeen also released recordings through Sunday Records and guitarist and co-founder&#x27;s own label The Tremolo Arm Users Club. They disbanded shortly after Sarah Records folded. They reformed in 2001, signed to Tremolo, and released a full-length album, &quot;Homesick and Happy to be Here&quot;, two singles, and a maxi-CD (see discography below).

In 2002, the band embarked on a US tour with Robert Wratten, playing solo acoustic performances as Trembling Blue Stars. In 2003, the band again played with Robert but as Trembling Blue Stars for a series of Los Angeles shows at Cafe Club Fais Do-Do.

Possibly the band&#x27;s biggest exposure came when one of their songs, &#x27;Sink or Float&#x27; was featured on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The song was also included on the UK edition of the series&#x27;s second soundtrack album, &quot;Radio Sunnydale&quot;.

Aberdeen broke up again in 2005 as their members drifted to other projects, though they released a career retrospective CD, &quot;What Do I Wish for Now? (Singles + Extras 1994–2004)&quot;, the following year on LTM. Lead singer Beth Arzy has also been a member of Trembling Blue Stars since 2000, and contributed to albums by The Occasional Keepers.

Aberdeen&#x27;s last performances were at The San Francisco Pop Fest on 05/26/2011 and at The EchoPlex in Los Angeles, opening for 14 Iced Bears and Phil Wilson on 6/5/11. Scheduled performances at Berlin Popfest that same year were ultimately cancelled.

In 2014, John Girgus released a cassette compilation of four-track demos titled &quot;It Was the Rain: Lost Recordings 1993-1995&quot; on UsedBinPop Recordings.

<doc id="459752" wikidata="Q175088" url="?curid=459752" title="Baron Strange">
<text>Baron Strange is a title which has been created four times in the Peerage of England. Two creations, one in 1295 and another in 1326, had only one holder each, upon whose deaths they became extinct. Two of the creations, that of 1299 and that of 1628, are extant. The surname &quot;Le Strange&quot; was Latinized as &quot;Extraneus&quot; (i.e. &quot;Foreigner, Stranger&quot;). The arms of Le Strange of Knockin Castle in Shropshire were: &quot;Gules, two lions passant argent&quot;.

All four baronies of Strange were created by writ, which means that they can also pass through female lines. 
Following the passing of the Peerage Act 1963, Elizabeth Frances Philipps, 14th Baroness Strange (of the 1299 creation), became the first female to take her seat in the House of Lords by virtue of an hereditary peerage.

==1295 creation==
The first creation came in 1295 when Roger le Strange &quot;of Salop&quot; (i.e. Shropshire) was summoned to the Model Parliament by writ addressed to &quot;Rogero Extraneo&quot;, by which he is deemed to have become Lord Strange. He was a younger son of John le Strange III of Knockin Castle in Shropshire, Sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire in 1236. On his death in 1311 the title became extinct.

==1299 creation==
The second creation came in 1299 when John le Strange V was summoned to the House of Lords by a writ directed to &quot;Johanni Lestraunge de Knokyn&quot;, by which he is deemed to have become Lord Strange. This creation is referred to as &quot;Baron Strange de Knokyn&quot; or &quot;Baron Strange of Knokyn&quot; (&quot;aliter&quot; Knokin or Knockin, etc.), named after his seat of Knockin Castle in Shropshire, which thus distinguishes it from the earlier 1295 barony, which was still extant on its creation. He was the eldest son and heir of John le Strange IV of Knockin, the eldest son of John le Strange III of Knockin, and was therefore the nephew of the baron of the 1295 creation. Hamo le Strange, younger brother of the 2nd Baron, founded the family of Le Strange of Hunstanton, Norfolk (which ancestral manor was given to him by the 2nd Baron in 1309), and bore his paternal arms differenced by a bendlet sable. (See L&#x27;Estrange baronets of Hunstanton, created in 1629, which male line continued until 1762)). Joan le Strange, &quot;suo jure&quot; 9th Baroness, daughter and heiress of the 8th Baron who died without male issue, married George Stanley, 9th Baron Strange, son of Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby, who was summoned to Parliament as Lord Strange in her right. Her son Thomas Stanley succeeded as both 2nd Earl of Derby and 10th Baron Strange.

The titles remained united until the death of his great-grandson, the fifth Earl and 13th Baron, in 1594. The earldom was inherited by his younger brother, the sixth Earl, while the barony of Strange (as well as the baronies of Mohun of Dunster and Stanley, also held by the Earl) fell into abeyance between the late Earl&#x27;s three daughters Lady Anne, Lady Frances and Lady Elizabeth (however, the sixth Earl of Derby erroneously assumed the barony of Strange - see below). The barony of Strange remained in abeyance for the next 327 years.

However, the abeyance was terminated in 1921 in favour of Elizabeth Frances Philipps, Viscountess St Davids, who became the fourteenth Baroness. She was the second wife of John Philipps, 1st Viscount St Davids. The abeyance of the ancient baronies of Hungerford and de Moleyns was terminated at the same time in her favour. On 31 July 1963, the Peerage Act 1963 came into effect, which, among other things, enabled women to sit and vote in the House of Lords by virtue of an hereditary peerage. Following the passage of the Act, Lady St Davids applied for a writ of summons to the House of Lords in right of her Strange barony, which was subsequently issued to her, and she took her seat in the House on 19 November 1963 as the first female peer to do so under the provision of the Peerage Act 1963. On her death in 1974 the titles were inherited by her son, the fifteenth Baron Strange, who had already succeeded his father as second Viscount St Davids. As of 2013 the titles are held by the second Viscount&#x27;s grandson, the fourth Viscount and seventeenth Baron Strange.

==1326 creation==
The third creation came in 1326 when Sir Eubulus le Strange was summoned to Parliament as Lord Strange. However, the title became extinct on his death in 1335. His nephew Roger le Strange, 4th Baron Strange of Knockyn, was his heir.

==1628 creation==
In 1594 William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby (1561-1642), following the death of his elder brother the 5th Earl of Derby, incorrectly assumed the title Baron Strange (created in 1299) (see above). In 1628 his son and heir apparent, James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby, was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration as &quot;Lord Strange&quot;. When it was discovered that his father&#x27;s assumption of the barony was erroneous, it was deemed that there were two baronies of Strange, one created in 1299 then in abeyance, and another created &quot;accidentally&quot; in 1628. James Stanley later succeeded his father as 7th Earl of Derby.

The titles remained united until the death of his grandson, the ninth Earl and third Baron, in 1702. The earldom was inherited by the late Earl&#x27;s younger brother, the tenth Earl, while the barony fell into abeyance between the Earl&#x27;s two daughters, Lady Henrietta and Lady Elizabeth. On Lady Elizabeth&#x27;s death in 1714 the abeyance was terminated in favour of Henrietta, who became the fourth Baroness. She married, firstly, John Annesley, 4th Earl of Anglesey, and after his death, secondly, John Ashburnham, 1st Earl of Ashburnham. Lady Strange was succeeded by her daughter from her second marriage, Henrietta Bridget, the fifth Baroness. However, she died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by her aforementioned great-uncle, the tenth Earl of Derby, who became the sixth Baron Strange.

Lord Derby was childless and was succeeded in the barony by his first cousin once removed James Murray, 2nd Duke of Atholl, who became the seventh Baron Strange as well. He was the grandson of Lady Amelia Anne Sophia Stanley, daughter of James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby. On his death the dukedom and barony separated. He was succeeded in the dukedom by his nephew John Murray, 3rd Duke of Atholl, while the barony passed to his daughter Charlotte, the eighth Baroness. She married her first cousin, the third Duke of Atholl. They were both succeeded by their son, the fourth Duke and ninth Baron. In 1786 he was created &quot;Earl Strange&quot; and &quot;Baron Murray of Stanley&quot; in the Peerage of Great Britain. The dukedom and barony remained united until the death of his great-great-grandson, the ninth Duke and fourteenth Baron, in 1957 (see the Duke of Atholl for more detailed information on the holders during this period and for later history of the title).

The barony of Strange fell into abeyance between the representatives of the three daughters of the fourth Duke of Atholl, Lady Charlotte, Lady Amelia Sophia and Lady Elizabeth. The abeyance was terminated by the Queen in 1965 in favour of John Drummond of Megginch, who became the fifteenth Baron. He was the great-grandson of Lady Charlotte and her second husband Admiral Sir Adam Drummond of Megginch. However, on his death in 1982 the peerage once again fell into abeyance, this time between his three daughters. It was called out of abeyance in 1986 in favour of the eldest daughter, Cherry, who became the sixteenth Baroness. She was the wife of Captain Humphrey ap Evans (1922–2009), who along with his wife assumed the name of Drummond of Megginch by decree of the Lord Lyon in 1965. Lady Strange was one of the ninety hereditary peers that were allowed to remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. On her death in 2005 the title was inherited by her eldest son, the seventeenth and () present holder of the title.

The family seat was Megginch Castle, near Errol, Perthshire.

The style Lord Strange was used as a courtesy title by the Earls of Derby until James Stanley, Lord Strange (1716–1771), Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; he was the son of Edward Stanley, 11th Earl of Derby, who (unlike his 6th cousin, the 10th Earl) did not hold the barony of Strange (it having passed to the Murray family). Nowadays the Earls of Derby use the courtesy title of &quot;Lord Stanley&quot; for heirs apparent.

<doc id="459758" wikidata="Q156438" url="?curid=459758" title="Neuroptera">
<text>The insect order Neuroptera, or net-winged insects, includes the lacewings, mantidflies, antlions, and their relatives. The order consists of some 6,000 species. Neuroptera is grouped together with the Megaloptera (alderflies, fishflies, and dobsonflies) and Raphidioptera (snakeflies) in the unranked taxon Neuropterida (once known as Planipennia).

Adult neuropterans have four membranous wings, all about the same size, with many veins. They have chewing mouthparts, and undergo complete metamorphosis.

Neuropterans first appeared during the Permian period, and continued to diversify through the Mesozoic era. During this time, several unusually large forms evolved, especially in the extinct family Kalligrammatidae, often called &quot;the butterflies of the Jurassic&quot; for their large, patterned wings.

==Anatomy and biology==

Neuropterans are soft-bodied insects with relatively few specialized features. They have large lateral compound eyes, and may or may not also have ocelli. Their mouthparts have strong mandibles suitable for chewing, and lack the various adaptations found in most other holometabolan insect groups.

They have four wings, usually similar in size and shape, and a generalised pattern of veins. Some neuropterans have specialised sense organs in their wings, or have bristles or other structures to link their wings together during flight.

The larvae are specialised predators, with elongated mandibles adapted for piercing and sucking. The larval body form varies between different families, depending on the nature of their prey. In general, however, they have three pairs of thoracic legs, each ending in two claws. The abdomen often has adhesive discs on the last two segments.

==Life cycle and ecology==

The larvae of most families are predators. Many chrysopids, hemerobiids and coniopterygids eat aphids and other pest insects, and some have been used for biological control (either from commercial distributors, but also abundant and widespread in nature).

Larvae in various families cover themselves in debris (including other insects, living and dead) as camouflage, taken to an extreme in the ant lions, which bury themselves completely out of sight and ambush prey from &quot;pits&quot; in the soil. Larvae of some Ithonidae are root feeders, and larvae of Sisyridae are aquatic, and feed on freshwater sponges. A few mantispids are parasites of spider egg sacs.

As in other holometabolic orders, the pupal stage is enclosed in some form of cocoon composed of silk and soil or other debris. The pupa eventually cuts its way out of the cocoon with its mandibles, and may even move about for a short while before undergoing the moult to the adult form.

Adults of many groups are also predatory, but some do not feed, or consume only nectar.

Beetles, wasps, and some lake flies parasitize neuropteran larvae.

==Evolution==

Neuropterans first appeared near the end of the Permian period, as shown by fossils of the Permithonidae from the Tunguska basin in Siberia and a similar fauna from Australia.

The osmylids are of Jurassic or Early Cretaceous origin and may be the most ancient of the Neuropteran groups. The extinct osmylid &quot;Protosmylus&quot; is fossilized in middle Eocene Baltic amber. The genus &quot;Burmaleon&quot; is described from two fossils of Cenomanian age Burmese amber, implying crown group radiation in the Early Cretaceous or earlier. The family Kalligrammatidae lived from the Jurassic to Aptian (Lower Cretaceous) periods.

Ithonidae are from the Jurassic to Recent, and the extinct lineages of the family were widespread geographically.

Following the end of the Cretaceous period, the diversity of neuropterans appears to have declined.

==Phylogeny==

Molecular analysis in 2018 using mitochondrial rRNA and mitogenomic data places the Megaloptera as sister to Neuroptera, and Raphidioptera as sister to this combined lineage, though these results were considered tentative. The fossil record has contributed to the understanding of the group&#x27;s phylogeny. Relationships within the Myrmeleontiformia are still in flux.


A phylogenomic analysis published in 2023 confirmed the topology of the neuropterid orders and found the relationships between the families of Neuropterida as shown in the following phylogenetic tree.


===Taxonomy===
Review of the Neropterid group orders by Engel, Winterton, and Breitkreuz (2018) included grouping of the Neuropteran families in a nested set of clades, an abandonment of the paraphyletic suborder &quot;Hemerobiiformia&quot; and redefinition of Myrmeleontiformia as a clade.

The fossil genus †&quot;Mesohemerobius&quot; from the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous of China has been treated as &quot;incertae sedis&quot; within Neuroptera, while the fossil families †Permoberothidae and †Permithonidae are treated as a sister group to clade Eidoneuroptera formed by Neuroptera + Megaloptera.

==In human culture==

The use of Neuroptera in biological control of insect pests has been investigated, showing that it is difficult to establish and maintain populations in fields of crops.

Five species of Neuroptera are among 1681 insect species eaten by humans worldwide.

The New Guinea Highland people claim to be able to maintain a muscular build and great stamina despite their low protein intake as a result of eating insects including Neuroptera.

==Geography==
Shiiba is a small, mountainous village situated in northwest Miyazaki prefecture, on the border with Kumamoto Prefecture. The entire area is surrounded by mountains ranging from 1,000 to 1,700 meters above sea level in the central Kyushu Mountains, including Mt. Kunimi in the northwest, and numerous rivers originate and flow through the valleys. Most of the village area is in the headwaters of the Mimi River, but the southern part of the village straddles the headwaters of the Hitotsuse and Komaru rivers. Due to the extremely rugged terrain, the habitable land area is only 4% of the village area, and villages exist scattered along rivers and on gentle slopes, mainly in the middle of mountains. The main area of Shiiba village (known as Kami-Shiiba) itself is quite small, however, several small hamlets surround the village to make up the area/region known as Shiiba. There are also a few dams located in the area, the main one being the Kamishiiba Dam which can be found in close proximity to Shiiba Secondary School. Due to its many rivers, waterfalls, and forests, it is an area of outstanding natural beauty. Most of the village is within the borders of the Kyūshū Chūō Sanchi Quasi-National Park.

Due to the remote, natural, cool environment of Shiiba, it is home to many kinds of wildlife. Although many of the native animals are rarely seen during the day, they can often be seen very early in the morning or at night, especially when driving. Shiiba is home to a large number of &quot;tanuki&quot; or raccoon dogs that live in the nearby forests and often come out at night to look for food.There are also a great number of wild boar in the area and they also come out at night and sometimes during the day to look for food.A large population of Sika deer also live in the Shiiba area. These animals are seldom seen, however, when they are spotted they will run off and disappear into the forest. This usually occurs during the early morning, dusk or at night time. In the late evening their cries can be heard all over Shiiba. Despite this, they have been known to jump in front of cars when startled and have caused a few accidents in the past. This is however, an uncommon occurrence. Both wild boar meat and deer meat are local delicacies that are often sold during the Heike festival (see below) and are sometimes served during special events and parties in the village.

The region is also host to a large number of insect groups. Although their numbers dwindle in the colder times of the year and are rarely seen, many are present during the summer months. A large number of Mantis can be seen during this period all over the village usually lying in wait to capture smaller insects for food. The summer also brings in a large number of butterflies, including large, almost hand-sized ones, that can be seen all over the place usually flying near plants and flowers. These can be seen in abundance around the local schools as many Japanese schools grow and keep flowers on their premises. During the summer months a variety of beetles can be found including rhinoceros beetles and the Japanese rhinoceros beetle. These large insects usually live underground and in cool, damp areas, hence they are not always easily seen. Many children in Japan, catch or buy these to breed or study them. Much like butterflies, they can be encountered around schools. Cockroaches can occasionally be seen during the humid periods of the summer months, however, they are not as common as they are in other parts of Japan. Cicadas can seldom be seen but can always be heard in the summer. As Shiiba has a number of rivers, waterfalls and reservoirs, a number of frogs and toads can be seen around the town during the summer months. As with cicadas they can often be heard more than seen. However, during the rainy season they have been known to swarm across several roads en masse on their way to their breading grounds so care should be taken.

==Climate==
The winters can be very cold, especially in the Okawachi area, with heavy snowfall and subzero temperatures. Although it changes slightly every year, it annually snows from the period starting from mid to late December until February. During this time most locals have to change their car tires to ones equipped with stronger treading (snow tires). This reduces the chance of slipping on the roads and makes it easier to drive up the more hilly, steep and occasionally exposed roads in the region. In summer Shiiba has high humidity and regular rains as result of the typhoon season. But, due to its central location within Kyushu, Shiiba tends to be protected by the surrounding mountain ranges and is relatively unaffected for the most part. However like many mountainous regions of Japan landslides have been known to occur, and during the period care should be taken as rivers and dams will be swollen. For most of the year Shiiba is relatively a cool compared to other parts of Miyazaki and Kyushu. This is directly due to its location in Kyushu, the slightly higher altitude, and the surrounding mountains and forests which keep it sheltered.

== Demographics ==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Shiiba has declined over the past 60 years.

== History ==
The area of Misato was part of ancient Hyūga Province. According to local legend, the area was settled by survivors of the Heike clan following their defeat at the Battle of Dan-no-ura in the Genpei War. The Kamakura shogunate dispatched Nasu Munehisa in 1191 to root out the remnants of the clan. Seeing no remaining threat from the Heike, he returned home, leaving behind an illegitimate son who took the &quot;Nasu&quot; family name, and whose descendants became local warlords who ruled the area into the Sengoku period. The territory was hotly contested in the wars of the Sengoku period between the Shimazu clan and other local warlords, eventually becoming part of Hitoyoshi Domain of Higo Province under the Tokugawa shogunate. The village of Shiiba within Nishiusuki District, Miyazaki was established on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was transferred to Higashiusuki District, Miyazaki in 1949.

==Government==
Shiiba has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral village council of 10 members. Shiiba, collectively with the village of Morotsuka and towns of Misato and Kadogawa contributes one member to the Miyazaki Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of the Miyazaki 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Shiiba has an economy based overwhelmingly on agriculture and forestry. 

==Education==
Education in Shiiba is regulated by the Shiiba Village Board of Education (教育委員会 - &quot;kyouikuiinkai&quot;&#x27;). As a result of the declining population, a few of the local schools have been closed over the years.
At present there are 6 primary schools and 1 main secondary school: The village does not have a high school.

The only secondary school in Shiiba is Shiiba Secondary School (椎葉中学校). Another secondary school, Matsuo Secondary School (松尾中学校) closed in spring 2013. Students from Matsuo Elementary School initially went straight to Matsuo Junior High School upon graduation. However, due its closure in the spring of 2013, all students in the region graduate to Shiiba Junior High school (This is now the main and only secondary school in Shiiba).
As there are no high schools in Shiiba, students are required to study at high schools in other parts of Miyazaki prefecture upon graduation.

Despite its remote location Shiiba is not internationally isolated and has had a longterm reciprocal exchange program with a sister school in Singapore.
All the final year secondary school students travel to Singapore each year during the summer holidays (August) as part of an international cultural exchange and homestay programme. This is then reciprocated in the winter (November–December) when students from Singapore travel to Shiiba. Due to the small size and close-knit nature of the community this is a town event, with the exchange often timed to coincide with local traditional festivals or events, such as Kagura or harvest festivals. 
The programme is unique, with few comparable programs in Japan, in part to the extent of local support and its structure allowing all students from Shiiba a chance experience foreign culture and the chance to forge strong friendship with people of their own age in a different country. It is an event that most students look forward to one day participating in.

== Transportation ==
As there are no train stations and only a very limited bus service from Hyuga, it is predominantly accessible by car; the village is several hours drive from both Miyazaki City (3~4hrs) and Kumamoto City (2~3hrs). If travelling from Fukuoka or Kagoshima it is accessed from the West via Gokase (30~50 minute drive) on the Miyazaki-Kumamoto border, or via the main road from the coastal town of Hyuga (90~110 minute drive) if travelling from the East. Though it is possible to travel through Okawachi via Hitoyoshi, the road is unclearly signed from hotspring town of Yunomae and care needs to be taken for rockfall and road closure during certain times of the year.

===Railways===
Shiiba has no passenger rail service. The nearest train station is on the JR Kyushu Nippō Main Line

===Heike Festival===
The village, despite being small, has a long and deep history. Every year, during early to mid November, the locals are joined by hundreds of people from other parts of the country to celebrate the Shiiba Heike Matsuri. This festival celebrates a legendary tragic love affair that took place between two members of rival samurai families in the area over 800 years ago. This celebration is of a secret love between the Heike clan&#x27;s Princess, Tsurutomi, and Nasu Daihachiro, a member of the Genji clan who had been given orders to destroy the Heike clan. It takes place over 3 days (Friday evening and the following Saturday and Sunday) and includes a number of special events and performances accompanied with food and souvenir stalls with the main attraction being the Heike Parade. Over 300 people participate in the parade with many local men and boys dressing up in samurai armour walking in line with Nasu Daihachiro, and the local women and girls dressing up as Heike maidens surrounding and following the Princess Tsurutomi. The roles for Princess Tsurutomi and Nasu Daihchiro are selected in the months before the parade by the village office. Many of the local school students and teachers, village officials and residents participate in the parade making it the starring attraction. The Heike Parade has been preceded in recent years by the talented, Kyushu famous, orchestra from Miyazaki Gakuen.

The town&#x27;s cartoon style mascot, Otsuru-chan (おつるちゃん), is based on Princess Tsurutomi.

===Outdoor activities===
Aside from the many hillwalking and hiking trails that cover the mountains around Shiiba, climbing, especially ice climbing in winter, has become popular; with climbers around Kyushu travelling to Shiiba due to the consistent subzero temperates and many frozen waterfalls to be found around the region. Along with hiking, camping is also popular, with camping and log cabins in the area available during the warmer months, as well as several guesthouses offering nature retreats.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hinokage is less than a third of what it was 50 years ago. Like many districts in rural Japan, the area has been struggling with an aging population and an exodus of young people to Tokyo and other major cities. The town&#x27;s population peaked in the 1950s at 16,199 people, (Cort &amp; Nakamura, 1994) but has steadily declined since the closure of the Mitate mine in March, 1970. (記念編纂部会, 1997) Between 2000 and 2005 four area elementary and middle schools were closed, and more closures are planned in the future.

== History ==
The area of Hinokage was part of ancient Hyūga Province. The area has been settled since the Japanese Paleolithic period, and the place name of &quot;Hinokage&quot; is found in the Nihon Shoki and other ancient texts as having been given to this area by the elder brother of Emperor Jimmu. During the Edo period, it was part of the holdings of Nobeoka Domain. The villages of Nanori (七折村), and Iwaikawa (岩井川村), within Nishiusuki District, Miyazaki were established on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. The two villages merged on January 1, 1951 to form the town of Hinokage.

==Government==
Hinokage has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of eight members. Hinokage, collectively with the towns of Gokase and Takachiho contributes one member to the Miyazaki Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of the Miyazaki 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The main industry of Hinokage is agriculture and forestry. Tin was once mined at the Mitate Mine in the northern part of town, but it was closed in 1963. Local specialities include bamboo crafts, processed fruit products and dried shiitake mushrooms. 

==Education==
Hinokage has three public elementary schools and one public junior high school operated by the town government. The town does not have a high school.

== Transportation ==
===Railways===
Hinokage has no passenger rail service. The nearest train station is on the JR Kyushu Nippō Main Line. The town was formerly served by the 50.0 Takachiho Railway, which ran from Nobeoka to Takachiho Station, with six intermediate stations within Hinokage. Services were discontinued on September 6, 2005, after flooding triggered by Typhoon Nabi washed away two bridges on the line, halting all operations. Efforts to obtain funding for rebuilding were unsuccessful, and the company was liquidated in 2009..

== History ==
===Deathride era, self-titled debut (2002–2004)===
Fafara hosted several barbecues after moving from Orange County to Santa Barbara and would jam with musicians he met, which led to the formation of the band.
&quot;I met Evan we struck up a friendship and started jamming,&quot; said Fafara. Guitarist Evan Pitts met Fafara in a restaurant and gave him his phone number for a jam session, while John Boecklin who originally played 2nd guitar then went to playing drums, met Fafara at a bar.

The band was originally known as Deathride, but later changed their name to DevilDriver because Fafara felt there were too many bands with that name; a band in Norfolk, Virginia, and a bicycle racing team. Another problem was that the band&#x27;s label, Roadrunner Records were unable to secure copyright. The members compiled a list of roughly two hundred names to go for a more original approach. Fafara&#x27;s wife had a book by Italian witchcraft author Raven Grimassi on Stregheria, and came across the term &quot;devil driver&quot;. The term &quot;devil driver&quot; refers to bells Italian witches used to drive evil forces away. Fafara thought it was appropriate because it sounded &quot;evil&quot;, and thought the term &quot;suits his life&quot;. The band&#x27;s logo is the Cross of Confusion, which has existed for thousands of years and refers to &quot;question religion, question authority, question everything around you&quot;. Fafara was brought up to &quot;question everything&quot; and was exposed to Italian witchcraft through his grandparents.

DevilDriver&#x27;s debut record was originally going to be called &quot;Thirteen&quot;, and then &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;. However, Fafara claims it was changed &quot;for so many reasons that I can&#x27;t even go into.&quot; The band&#x27;s self-titled debut &quot;DevilDriver&quot;, was released on October 28, 2003, under Roadrunner Records, and entered the Top Heatseekers chart at number 17. Guitarist Pitts wrote roughly 90% of the music, according to Mike Spreitzer, who replaced Pitts after his departure from the band.

===&quot;The Fury of Our Maker&#x27;s Hand&quot; (2005–2006)===
The band returned to the studio in 2005 to record their follow-up to &quot;DevilDriver&quot;. The album was produced at Sonic Ranch Studios, a pecan ranch, away from El Paso, Texas. The band members wanted to be isolated while recording the album so they could focus solely on the music, as friends, family, managers and girlfriends were constantly interrupting them. Roughly 30 songs were written which were narrowed down to 15 by the band. The 15 songs were then played for producer Colin Richardson who wanted to begin tracking immediately.

The name of the album was thought of by Fafara who believed that &quot;The Fury of Our Maker&#x27;s Hand&quot; refers to the &quot;storm&quot; his life has been the past 10 years, &quot;You have your maker&#x27;s hand and I have my maker&#x27;s hand and we both living in our fury, the fury of our maker&#x27;s hand. It explains my life&quot;. The album was released on June 28, 2005, and debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number 117, with sales of 10,402 in its first week. The album also debuted at number 1 on the Top Heatseekers chart. Johnny Loftus of Allmusic described the album as &quot;a severe turn away from the falter of their first album&quot; and said that the band made their &quot;true debut the second time around&quot;. Dom Lawson of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; gave the album a positive review describing the album as a &quot;fresh and exhilarating approach to modern metal&quot;.

The band toured extensively in support of the album, which included shows in the United States, Europe, and Australia in support of bands such as In Flames, Fear Factory, and Machine Head. The band played for the first time as a headliner in the Burning Daylight Tour. On October 31, 2006, &quot;The Fury of Our Maker&#x27;s Hand&quot; was re-released to include three new studio tracks, including &quot;Digging up the Corpses&quot; which was featured on the soundtrack to &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;. The release also contained three live recordings of previously released, a DVD of all of the band&#x27;s music videos, new cover art, and inside liner notes.

===&quot;The Last Kind Words&quot; (2007–2008)===
The band reunited at Sonic Ranch Studios while they recorded their third studio effort, &quot;The Last Kind Words&quot;, which was released in June 2007. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Not All Who Wander Are Lost&quot; was directed by Nathan Cox for free. Cox&#x27;s career began when he created Coal Chamber&#x27;s music video &quot;Loco&quot;, so he re-paid a favor to Fafara and the band. Cox now directs music videos for bands such as Linkin Park and Korn. The first song to be previewed was &quot;Horn of Betrayal&quot; which debuted on Sirius Satellite&#x27;s Hard Attack channel on May 16, 2007. &quot;The Last Kind Words&quot; entered the German charts at number 92, and peaked at number 48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with over 14,000 copies sold.

DevilDriver promoted the album at the 2007 Download Festival at Donington Park alongside headliners Linkin Park, Iron Maiden, and My Chemical Romance. A Guinness world record was attempted by the band for the &quot;largest circle pit&quot; at the festival. Guinness responded to the query and denied the request stating they receive over 60,000 requests a year and there is no way to physically define where a circle pit starts and ends. They considered the proposal fully in the context of the subject area and stated that &quot;our decision is final in this matter&quot;.
The band also appeared at 2007&#x27;s Ozzfest. Fafara had been planning to take his first six weeks off in 11 years, but Sharon Osbourne, who had managed Fafara&#x27;s previous band Coal Chamber, persuaded him to appear. At a concert in Detroit, Michigan, a recording was made with the intention of releasing a live DVD in 2008 although this has yet to be released.

DevilDriver&#x27;s songs &quot;Devil&#x27;s Son&quot; and &quot;Driving Down the Darkness&quot; were featured in the TV show &quot;Scrubs&quot;, and in 2008 they covered the Iron Maiden song &quot;Wasted Years&quot; for the &quot;Kerrang!&quot; compilation &quot;Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden&quot;. The song &quot;Clouds Over California&quot; became available as a download for the music video game &quot;Rock Band&quot;.

=== &quot;Pray for Villains&quot; (2009–2010) ===
Their fourth album &quot;Pray for Villains&quot; was released on July 14, 2009, debuting at No. 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with estimated sales of around 14,600, improving on their previous effort, which debuted at No. 48.

On February 21, 2009, the band performed in Australia at the Soundwave Festival with bands such as Lamb of God and In Flames. After finishing their Melbourne show, they announced that their new album would be released August 11, 2009. The band also toured in the Midwest states in mid-May 2009 with bands such as Slipknot, 3 Inches of Blood and All That Remains before headlining the &#x27;Thrash and Burn&#x27; Tour with Emmure, Despised Icon, MyChildren MyBride, Oceano, Kittie, and Thy Will Be Done amongst others. They also completed a European Tour with several other bands such as Behemoth and Suicide Silence.

In January and February 2010, DevilDriver embarked on their headlining &#x27;Bound By The Road&#x27; Tour with Suffocation, Goatwhore, and Thy Will Be Done.

In March 2010, DevilDriver participated in 2010&#x27;s Getaway Rock festival, which was held in Gävle, Sweden and began on July 8 and ended on the 10th. The band will also be included in an extensive UK tour in November 2010 with 36 Crazyfists.

=== &quot;Beast&quot; (2011) ===
DevilDriver&#x27;s fifth album &quot;Beast&quot; was recorded at Sonic Ranch studios in Tornillo, Texas with producer Mark Lewis, and released February 22, 2011. John Boecklin confirmed that the new album was mixed by Andy Sneap at his Backstage studio in Derbyshire, England in July. DevilDriver went on a tour in Australia with bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, All That Remains and Nonpoint for the Soundwave Festival in February and March 2011.

On March 30, it was announced that bassist Jon Miller and DevilDriver would part ways, in the interest of Miller&#x27;s continuing recovery. Miller departed on his own and released a resignation letter to the press. 

DevilDriver opened for Danzig along with 2Cents in 2011 supporting Danzig&#x27;s 2010 release &quot;Deth Red Sabaoth&quot;, and toured North America with Chthonic and Skeletonwitch supporting Arch Enemy.

DevilDriver headlined the 2012 Metal Alliance Festival Tour in the spring.

On February 9, 2012, guitarist Jeff Kendrick announced via his Twitter account that himself, John Boecklin (drums) and Mike Spreitzer (guitars) had &quot;begun to compose and demo songs for DevilDriver&#x27;s 6th album.

In a March 2013 interview with Get Your Rock Out guitarist Jeff Kendrick announced that an album title was &quot;very close&quot;, adding that the record was currently being mixed with only a couple of pieces of vocal recording to be done before the album is mastered. On May 28, 2013, DevilDriver released the cover artwork and release date for the new album, &quot;Winter Kills&quot;. The album was released on August 27, 2013, by Napalm Records, their first album release since leaving Roadrunner.

On October 28, 2014, Dez Fafara announced that drummer John Boecklin and guitarist Jeff Kendrick left the band, the former going on to form the band, Bad Wolves. He also announced that the band will be on hiatus until 2016, when the new album will be released, to focus on his reunion with Coal Chamber.

===&quot;Trust No One&quot; (2015–2016)===
On January 7, 2015, it was announced that past member Chimaira drummer Austin D&#x27;Amond had joined the band as the new drummer. On March 19, 2015, Neal Tiemann was announced as the replacement for Jeff Kendrick on guitars. Tiemann started his career with Midwest Kings and has spent time playing with Caroline&#x27;s Spine, Burn Halo and Uncle Kracker among others.

On May 2, 2015, Dez Fafara said that there were 12 new songs written for the next DevilDriver album. They were anticipating recording them in October–November 2015 and Spring-Summer 2016 for a release date later in 2016. Dez Fafara continued that DevilDriver had to get back into their normal recording cycle; he did not want DevilDriver sitting around too long although they did need to take a break after releasing &quot;Winter Kills&quot;.

On November 19, 2015, DevilDriver revealed the title for the upcoming album, &quot;Trust No One&quot;, alongside the album art. The album is set to be released on May 13, 2016. In March, DevilDriver announced that former Static-X guitarist, Diego &quot;Ashes&quot; Ibarra, would replace the recently departed Chris Towning on bass on a permanent basis for upcoming shows in the US, European and UK dates in support of the new album.

On March 18, 2016, DevilDriver released their first single from upcoming album, &quot;Trust No One&quot;, titled &#x27;Daybreak&#x27;, through their official YouTube channel.

===&quot;Outlaws &#x27;til the End&quot; (2017)===

===&quot;Dealing with Demons&quot; (2018–present)===
On April 9, 2018, it was reported that DevilDriver had 48 songs written for a new concept double album, with Fafara stating &quot;this will be the record of our career&quot;. The band are planning on narrowing down the songs to &quot;20 or 22&quot; and enter the studio in June 2018. In January 2019, Fafara posted on Instagram that he had begun tracking vocals for the new albums and that a summer 2019 release should be expected. In July 2019, Fafara announced that the first part of the double album should be expected in early 2020 with the second part in 2021. He also stated that a second volume of Outlaw Country covers in 2023 before a final studio album in 2024/2025. He went on to say that he would then take a prolonged break from music for 4/5 years. In later 2019, DevilDriver canceled a run of shows in support of Static-X and an appearance on the inaugural MegaCruise (a festival on a cruise ship organized by Megadeth), this was due to Fafara&#x27;s wife being diagnosed, treated and subsequently cured for skin cancer. On May 21, 2020, the first part of a double album was announced, &quot;Dealing with Demons - Part 1&quot;, scheduled for release October 9, 2020.

On September 3, 2024, Mike Spreitzer announced that he left the band after 20 years.

==Musical style and influences==
DevilDriver&#x27;s music has been widely described as groove metal and melodic death metal. All of the members have stated they are influenced by several types of music. Miller&#x27;s songwriting influences include Acid Bath, Morbid Angel, Mercyful Fate and Blind Guardian; Miller states that other bands that influenced his songwriting are the same bands that he has now had the opportunity to tour with Slayer, In Flames, Opeth, Fear Factory and Metallica. Fafara&#x27;s influences include Johnny Cash, and Motörhead, stating he likes people with &quot;low voices&quot;. Members of DevilDriver can be seen on Machine Head&#x27;s &quot;Elegies&quot; DVD citing Machine Head as an influence.
Boecklin&#x27;s main inspiration into becoming a percussionist came from his enjoyment of Metallica, Primus and Ministry.

<text>Goose barnacles, also called percebes, turtle-claw barnacles, stalked barnacles, gooseneck barnacles, are filter-feeding crustaceans that live attached to hard surfaces of rocks and flotsam in the ocean intertidal zone. Goose barnacles formerly made up the taxonomic order Pedunculata, but the group has been found to be polyphyletic, with its members scattered across multiple orders of the infraclass Thoracica.

== Biology ==

Some species of goose barnacles such as &quot;Lepas anatifera&quot; are pelagic and are most frequently found on tidewrack on oceanic coasts. Unlike most other types of barnacles, intertidal goose barnacles (e.g. &quot;Pollicipes pollicipes&quot; and &quot;Pollicipes polymerus&quot;) depend on water motion rather than the movement of their cirri for feeding, so are found only on exposed or moderately exposed coasts.

== Spontaneous generation ==
In the days before birds were known to migrate, barnacle geese, &quot;Branta leucopsis&quot;, were thought to have developed from this crustacean through spontaneous generation, since they were never seen to nest in temperate Europe, hence the English names &quot;goose barnacle&quot; and &quot;barnacle goose&quot;, and the scientific name &quot;Lepas anserifera&quot; (, &quot;goose&quot;). The confusion was prompted by their similarities in colour and shape. Because they were often found on driftwood, the barnacles were assumed to be attached to branches before they fell in the water. The archdeacon of Brecon, Gerald of Wales, made this claim in his &quot;Topographia Hiberniae&quot;.

Since barnacle geese were thought to be &quot;neither flesh, nor born of flesh&quot;, they were allowed to be eaten on days when eating meat was forbidden by some Christian churches, though it was not universally accepted. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II examined barnacles and noted no evidence of any bird-like embryo in them, and the secretary of Lev of Rozmital wrote a very skeptical account of his reaction to being served the goose at a fast-day dinner in 1456.

== Biomedical research ==
One component of&quot; L. anatifera&quot; that continues to be researched today is the adhesive properties of its secretion. Following an observational study regarding the adhesive properties of goose barnacle, its adhesive gland cells were located inside the muscle layer on the back side of the main stalk (peduncle). These glands secrete protein-based adhesive to make attaching the barnacles to fixed or mobile items/entities possible. This research in the barnacle adhesive serves as inspiration to the healthcare community to conduct their own research in an attempt to improve medical adhesive.

==As food==
In Portugal and Spain, &quot;P. pollicipes&quot; is a widely consumed and expensive delicacy known as percebes, which are harvested commercially in the Iberian northern coast, mainly in Galicia and Asturias, but also in the southwestern Portuguese coast (Alentejo), and are also imported from other countries within its range of distribution, particularly from Morocco. A larger but less palatable species (&quot;P. polymerus&quot;) was also exported to Spain from Canada until 1999, when the Canadian government ceased exports due to depletion of stocks.

In Spain, &quot;percebes&quot; are lightly boiled in brine and served whole and hot under a napkin. To eat them, the diamond-shaped foot is pinched between thumb and finger and the inner tube pulled out of the scaly case. The claw is removed and the remaining flesh is swallowed. Historically, the indigenous peoples of California ate the stem after cooking it in hot ashes.

<text>Homesick and Happy to Be Here is an album by the Los Angeles pop band Aberdeen, released in 2002.

==Critical reception==
&quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; deemed &quot;Homesick and Happy to Be Here&quot; &quot;a gentle collection of guitar pop with elegant vocals.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the album is a charming combination of strummy bedroom pop, fuzzy and smoldering guitars, and girl-boy vocals highlighted by [Beth] Arzy&#x27;s plaintive entreaties.&quot;

AllMusic called the album &quot;a roomy, positively beaming sort of record of diamond-sharp mid-tempo indie pop, a uniquely delayed first attempt that runs somewhere between Jeepster earnestness and the flagrant sparkle of the Trash Can Sinatras&#x27; &quot;Cake&quot;.&quot;

<text>is a village located in Higashikunisaki District, Ōita Prefecture, Japan. The name &quot;Himeshima&quot; literally means &quot;Princess Island.&quot; 

== Geography ==
The village is on a small island in the Seto Inland Sea and is sometimes referred to as Hime Island in English. The island of Himeshima is just off the Kunisaki Peninsula on the island of Kyūshū. 

The island consists of four volcanically-formed islets which are now connected by sandbars to form Himeshima Island. Signs of the volcanic activity which formed the now-connected islets 300,000 years ago can be found throughout the island.

The tallest mountain on the island is Mount Yahazu (矢筈岳, &quot;Yahazu-dake&quot;). It is a volcano that was active 90,000 years ago. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;Himeshima Fuji&quot; due to its importance to the people of the island and its distinctive lava domes.

== Transportation ==
=== With the mainland ===
Himeshima is accessible by ferry from Imi Port (伊美港) in Kunisaki and has 12 regularly scheduled round-trip departures per day. It is about a 20 minute ride one way. 
=== On the island ===
There is a village bus which travels around the island six times per day. 

Bicycles and ultra-compact electric cars are available to rent on the island.

== Population ==
As of 2022, the village has an estimated population of 1,642. The total area is 6.98 km2. There are 833 households and 98 businesses employing 389 people. 

== Economy == 

The main occupations are fishing and shrimp farming. The kuruma prawn (車海老, &quot;kurumaebi&quot;) and &quot;hijiki&quot; are local specialities on the island. 

Tourism is another major industry with nearly 40,000 people visiting the island every year.

Himeshima has launched a website to promote itself as &quot;IT Island&quot; in order to attract IT companies and personnel to the island.

== Festivals and events == 
Every summer around Obon, there is type of &quot;bon odori&quot; (盆踊り) called &quot;fox dance&quot; (キツネ踊り, &quot;kitsune odori&quot;) featuring dancers, particularly young children, dressed as foxes. 

In October of every year, there is a &quot;Kuruma Prawn Festival&quot; (車えび祭) for visitors to enjoy the local specialty. Visitors can also enjoy the popular &quot;kitsune odori&quot; at this event as well.

Every year, chestnut tiger butterflies can be seen on the island from mid-May to mid-June as well as in mid-October as they stop in Himeshima during their long migrations. The butterflies, called &quot;Asagimadara&quot; (アサギマダラ) in Japanese, draw many visitors to the island. 
== The &quot;Seven Wonders of Himeshima&quot; ==
On Himeshima, there are seven popular sightseeing locations, all with legends surrounding them, which are referred to as the &quot;Seven Wonders of Himeshima&quot; (姫島七不思議, &quot;himeshima nana fushigi&quot;). They are as follows: 

* Amida Oysters: in a cave under the island&#x27;s lighthouse, there are oysters which are said to never come into contact with seawater. It is believed that eating them will cause stomachaches.
* Hyoshimizu: iron rich and naturally carbonated onsen with water relatively cool in temperature. A local legend says that a princess who wanted to rinse her mouth after applying &quot;ohaguro&quot; caused the water to start flowing. 
* The Inverted Willow: a willow tree that is believed to have sprouted after a princess placed her toothpick into the ground upside-down. 
* The Ohaguro Stone: a stone which is believed to bear marks from when the princess applied her &quot;ohaguro&quot;. 
* Sennin-do: a small Buddhist hall surrounded by an obsidian rock formation of volcanic origin. Local legends say that 1,000 people hid here on New Year&#x27;s Eve to avoid paying taxes to a local lord (&quot;Sennin&quot; literally means &quot;1,000 people&quot;). 
* Ukisu: a &quot;torii&quot; on a small piece of land in the ocean which is said to enshrine a &quot;kami&quot; of fishing. It is believed that the &quot;torii&quot; never becomes submerged by the sea. 
* Ukita: a rice field in which a snake is said to have been buried. According to the legend, the rice fields began to shake due to the snake&#x27;s anger.

== Education ==
There are currently two schools on the island, Himeshima Elementary School (姫島村立姫島小学校) and Himeshima Junior High School (姫島村立姫島中学校).

== Politics ==
In the 2017 Japanese general election, 77.51% of Himeshima&#x27;s proportional ballots were cast for either one of the two parties in the conservative ruling coalition (the Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito) or one of the two minor LDP-allied conservative parties (Party for Japanese Kokoro and New Party Daichi), making it the most conservative municipality in the country in this election under that definition (excluding Kuroshima Island&#x27;s 82.76% conservative voting result, as this island is technically a part of Matsuura, Nagasaki and not its own municipality).

In 2024, Akio Fujimoto (藤本昭夫), the head of Himeshima village, retired after serving for 40 years. He was replaced by Yasuharu Daikai (大海靖治) in an uncontested election.

<doc id="459795" wikidata="Q838940" url="?curid=459795" title="Clymene dolphin">
<text>The Clymene dolphin (Stenella clymene), in older texts known as the short-snouted spinner dolphin, is a dolphin endemic to the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only confirmed case of hybrid speciation in marine mammals, descending from the spinner dolphin and the striped dolphin.

==Taxonomy==
The Clymene dolphin was first formally described by John Edward Gray in 1846, although, unusually, he did not assign it its current name until four years later, in 1850. From then on, until a reassessment in 1981, the Clymene dolphin was regarded as a subspecies of the spinner dolphin (&quot;Stenella longirostris&quot;). In 1981, Perrin &quot;et al.&quot; asserted the Clymene&#x27;s existence as separate species. Until this time, because Clymenes are relatively remote and were regarded as very similar to the more accessible spinners, they were never heavily studied. Anatomical and behavioral traits suggested that this species is a hybrid of the spinner dolphin and striped dolphin (&quot;Stenella coeruleoalba&quot;), and DNA testing has shown that it is indeed a hybrid species.

The common and scientific names are probably derived from the Greek Oceanid Clymene, although it has also been argued that it may instead come from the Greek word for &quot;notorious&quot;.

== Description ==

The Clymene dolphin looks very similar to the spinner dolphin. At close quarters, it is possible to observe that the beak of the Clymene is slightly shorter than that of its relative. The dorsal fin is also less erect and triangular.

The basic color of the Clymene dolphin is &quot;cetacean neapolitan&quot;; it occurs in three shaded layers, the underside being white. Next, a strip of light grey runs from just above the beak, round either side of the eye back to the tail stock, where the band thickens. The top layer, from the forehead, along the back to the dorsal fin, and down to the top of the tail stock, is a dark grey. The beak, lips, and flippers are also dark grey in color. Clymene dolphins grow to about in length and in weight.

==Behavior and biology==

Clymene dolphins spend most of their lives in waters over in depth, but occasionally move into shallower, coastal regions. They feed on squid and small schooling fish, hunting either at night, or in mesopelagic waters where there is only limited light. Predators include cookie-cutter sharks, as evidenced by bite marks seen on a number of animals.

Clymenes are fairly active dolphins. They do spin longitudinally when jumping clear of the water, but not with as much regularity and complexity as the spinner dolphin. They will also approach boats and ride bow waves. Group sizes vary from just four up to around 150 individuals, although about forty is typical. Many of these groups appear to be single-sex, and also to be segregated by the approximate age of the individuals. Clymene dolphins are also highly vocal, making short whistles in a range of 6–19 kHz.

No figures are available for the size of animals at birth. Gestation, lactation, and maturation periods are all unknown, but are unlikely to vary greatly from others in the genus &quot;Stenella&quot;. Their longevity is also unknown, although at least one sixteen-year-old individual has been reported from a stranding.

== Population and distribution ==

The Clymene dolphin is endemic to the Atlantic Ocean. Its full range is still poorly understood, particularly at its southern end. The species certainly prefer temperate and tropical waters. The northern end of the range runs roughly from New Jersey east-southeast to southern Morocco. The southern tip runs from somewhere around Angola to Rio de Janeiro. They appear to prefer deep water. Numerous sightings have been recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. The species has not been sighted, however, in the Mediterranean Sea.

The total population is unknown. The only population estimate available is for the north part of the Gulf of Mexico, where a count of 6,500 individuals was reported. However, it is suspected that there are three well-defined populations in the Atlantic Ocean, located in the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and the Gulf of Mexico. As of more recent research, it is presumed that individuals from the South Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico move between these two populations, while the North Atlantic population seems to be more isolated. The species may naturally be rare in comparison with others in the genus &quot;Stenella&quot;.

== Human interaction ==

Some individuals have been killed from directed fisheries in the Caribbean and others may have been caught in nets off West Africa.

== Conservation ==

The West African population of the Clymene dolphin is listed in Appendix II of the convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), since it has an unfavorable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organized by tailored agreements.

The Clymene dolphin is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia.

<text>Europa Europa (, lit., &quot;Hitler Youth Salomon&quot;) is a 1990 historical war drama film directed by Agnieszka Holland, and starring Marco Hofschneider, Julie Delpy, Hanns Zischler, and André Wilms. It is based on the 1989 autobiography of Solomon Perel, a German-Jewish boy who escaped the Holocaust by masquerading as a Nazi and joining the Hitler Youth. Perel himself appears briefly as &quot;himself&quot; in the film&#x27;s finale. The film&#x27;s title refers to World War II&#x27;s division of continental Europe, resulting in a constant national shift of allegiances, identities, and front lines.

The film is an international co-production between the German company CCC Film and companies in France and Poland. &quot;Europa Europa&quot; won the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay in 1992.

==Plot==
In 1938, in Nazi Germany, on the eve of thirteen-year-old Solomon &quot;Solek&quot; Perel&#x27;s bar mitzvah, &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; occurs. Solek evades the Nazis and later learns that his sister has been murdered. His father decides the family will move to his birthplace of Łódź in Poland, believing it will be safer there. Less than a year later, World War II begins, and Germany invades Poland. Solek&#x27;s family decides he and his brother Isaak should flee to Eastern Europe. The brothers head for the eastern border of Poland, only to learn the Soviets have invaded. The brothers are separated, and Solek ends up in a Soviet orphanage in Grodno with other Polish refugee children.

Solek lives in the orphanage for two years, where he joins the Komsomol, receives a communist education, and learns Russian. He takes a romantic interest in Inna, a young instructor who defends him when the authorities discover his class origin is bourgeois. Solek receives a letter from his parents informing him of their imprisonment in the Łódź Ghetto.

Solek is captured by German soldiers during the German invasion of the Soviet Union and finds himself amongst Soviet prisoners. As the Germans single out the Jews and commissars for execution, Solek hides his identity papers and tells the Germans he is &quot;Josef Peters&quot;, a &quot;Volksdeutscher&quot; from Grodno. The soldiers believe Josef&#x27;s parents were ethnic German, and he was in the orphanage because his parents were killed by the Soviets. Using his German-Russian bilingual language skill, &quot;Josef&quot; helps the unit identify a prisoner as Yakov Dzhugashvili, Joseph Stalin&#x27;s son. The unit is impressed and adopts Solek as their interpreter, due to his fluency in German and Russian.

Solek avoids any public bathing or urinating, as his circumcised penis would expose him as a Jew. A closeted homosexual German soldier named Robert discovers Solek&#x27;s secret but shows solidarity and sympathizes with him as they share a common ground of being in danger of persecution due to their backgrounds. During combat, Robert is killed, and Solek, the lone survivor of his unit, attempts to reach the Soviets. As he crosses a bridge, German soldiers charge across behind him, and the Soviet troops surrender; Solek is hailed as a hero. The company commander decides to adopt Solek and send him to the elite Hitler Youth Academy in Braunschweig, to receive a Nazi education.

At the school, Solek is very careful to hide his circumcision. Leni, a member of the Bund Deutscher Mädel who serves meals at the Academy, becomes infatuated with Solek. He returns her affections, but does not consummate their relationship for fear of exposing himself.

During his leave from the Academy, Solek travels to Łódź to find his family; however, the ghetto is sealed off and guarded. Solek rides a tram that travels through the ghetto, observing sights of tortured and starved people. Later, Solek visits Leni&#x27;s mother, who does not sympathize with the Nazis. She tells him Leni is pregnant by Solek&#x27;s roommate, Gerd, and will give up the child to the &quot;Lebensborn&quot; program. When Leni&#x27;s mother presses Josef on his identity, he breaks down and confesses he is Jewish; she promises not to betray him.

Solek is summoned to the Gestapo offices. There, he is prodded about his supposed parentage and is asked to show a &quot;Certificate of Racial Purity&quot;. When Solek claims the certificate is in Grodno, the Gestapo official says he will send for it. As Solek leaves to meet with Gerd, the building is destroyed by Allied bombs; Solek survives while Gerd dies in the bombing.

As Soviet troops close in on Berlin, the Hitler Youth are sent to the front lines. Solek deserts his unit and surrenders to the Soviets. His captors doubt that he is a Jew and accuse him of being a traitor. There, Solek learns of the Nazi death camps. The Soviets are about to have him shot when Solek&#x27;s brother Isaak, just released from a camp, recognizes Solek. Isaak reveals their parents were killed years prior when the Łódź Ghetto was &quot;liquidated&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Solek emigrates to the British Mandate of Palestine. 

The real Solomon Perel, seen in modern day, sings as the film fades to a close.

==Cast==
== Release ==

===Box office===
The film was given a limited release in the United States on 28 June 1991, and grossed $31,433 in its opening weekend in two theaters. Its final international gross was US$5,575,738.

=== Reception ===
&quot;Europa Europa&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics. &quot;Europa Europa&quot; has an approval rating of 95% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 21 reviews, and an average rating of 7.8/10. 

Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, critic Michael Wilmington lauded the film&#x27;s multi-faceted structure, calling &quot;Europa Europa&quot; &quot;a tense suspense story, an ironic romance, and a truly black comedy — all driving toward a dark crisis of identity&quot;. 

In a positive review, Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said it &quot;accomplishes what every film about the Holocaust seeks to achieve: It brings new immediacy to the outrage by locating specific, wrenching details that transcend cliche&quot;.

Hal Hinson, of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, praised the direction, saying &quot;Holland isn&#x27;t a dour moral instructor; she&#x27;s an ironist with a deft ability to capture the absurd aspects of her material and keep them in balance with the tragic&quot;. Hinson commended the film for its &quot;[awareness] of the toll [Solly&#x27;s] shape-shifting compromises exacts&quot;. Desson Howe, also of &quot;The Post&quot;, was more critical, citing the film&#x27;s &quot;emotional distance&quot;, and, similarly to Maslin, said the film did not fully probe Solly&#x27;s conscience.

=== Best Foreign Film controversy ===
As it won four major &quot;best foreign-language film&quot; prizes from American critics&#x27; groups of the 1991 awards season, &quot;Europa Europa&quot; was strongly regarded as a contender for a Best Foreign Film Oscar for the 64th Academy Awards ceremony. However, the German Export Film Union, which oversaw the Oscar selection committee for German films, declined to submit the film for a nomination. The committee reasoned the film did not meet certain eligibility criteria, such as not qualifying as a German film. However, the film was a co-production between Germany, Poland, and France; in addition, much of the film is spoken in German, while the film&#x27;s producer and much of the cast and crew is German. Export committee members reportedly called the film &quot;junk&quot; and &quot;an embarrassment&quot;. The film&#x27;s unconventional use of black comedy, as opposed to full tragedy, in a Holocaust film has been speculated to be a main cause for the committee&#x27;s omission. The omission prompted leading German film-makers to write a public letter of support for the film and its director, Agnieszka Holland. The letter signees included Werner Herzog, Wolfgang Petersen, and Wim Wenders.

Despite the film&#x27;s omission, it went on to be a critical and commercial success in the United States, where it became the second most successful German film, after 1981&#x27;s &quot;Das Boot&quot;, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.

==Accolades==
== Home media ==
The film was released on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on 4 March 2003. The Criterion Collection released a special edition Blu-ray of the film on 9 July 2019.

<text>George Henry Preble (February 25, 1816 – March 1, 1885) was an American naval officer and writer, notable for his history of the flag of the United States and for taking the first photograph of the Fort McHenry flag that inspired the U.S. national anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Portland, Maine, into a seafaring family; his father was sea captain Enoch Preble, whose brother was the noted Commodore Edward Preble. George entered the Navy as a midshipman on December 10, 1835, serving on the frigate until 1838.

==Career==
He was in the Florida war in 1841, and was on the sloop for its circumnavigation of the world in 1843–1845, taking ashore the first American force to land in China. In the Mexican–American War, he participated in the capture of Alvarado, Veracruz, and Tuxpan. He became master on July 15, 1847, and lieutenant on February 5, 1848. While serving on the frigate , he went with Matthew C. Perry to Japan in 1853, during which Preble surveyed various harbors in the Far East.

After a period as lighthouse inspector and at Charlestown Navy Yard, he served on , 1859–1861, then took command of the steam-gunboat , serving with David Farragut on the Mississippi River, was promoted to commander on July 16, 1862, and given command of the steam-sloop blockading Mobile Bay.

When the Confederate cruiser eluded him, Preble was dismissed from the Navy, but was reinstated after the captain of &quot;Florida&quot; testified that superior speed alone had saved him.

Additionally, each of the officers on &quot;Oneida&quot; testified that Preble had done no wrong. According to their accounts, &quot;Florida&quot; appeared at around 5:00 pm on September 4, 1862, bearing the ensign of a ship of the English Navy. Preble was in command of &quot;Oneida&quot; and . Because the other ships were in for repairs, the usual complement of six ships had been reduced to two. &quot;Winona&quot; had been dispatched to chase another blockade runner and was returning from that chase when &quot;Florida&quot; began her run. One of &quot;Oneida&quot;″s iron boilers had been shut down for repairs, leaving only one in operation. (One of the officers stated that the Navy&#x27;s choice to use cheaper iron rather than steel was the actual cause of the problem.) 
When &quot;Florida&quot; began her run, Preble moved to place&quot;Oneida&quot; in front of &quot;Florida&quot;. At 6:00 pm, he ordered shots fired across her bow. Believing that the ship was English, two warning shots were fired over her bow and a third shot into her forefoot (The part of a ship at which the prow joins the keel) instead of the customary single warning shot. All three shots were fired within three minutes of her being in range of &quot;Oneida&quot;″s guns. When &quot;Florida&quot; did not stop, Preble ordered the fourth shot be sent into the enemy ship. This shot missed, at which time &quot;Florida&quot; lowered her false ensign, and made directly for Fort Morgan. It was not until this point that Preble could be sure that the ship was a Confederate vessel. With one boiler out of commission, &quot;Oneida&quot; was unable to keep pace with &quot;Florida&quot;, which escaped into the bay. However, &quot;Oneida&quot; kept up fire on the ship for 29 minutes until it was safely under the protection of Fort Morgan. In addition to the speed issue, the reports state that there were some visibility issues that contributed to poor marksmanship of &quot;Oneida&quot;″s gun crew.

After being reinstated, Preble commanded the sailing sloop , only to have &quot;Florida&quot; escape him once again, off Madeira.

===Writing career===
Preble was also known as a writer on naval and historical topics and as a collector of naval documents. His extensive personal library of books and documents related to the sea is located in The George Henry Preble Collection at the Navy Department Library.

In 1872, he published his &quot;History of the American Flag&quot;, which is still cited as a source. He also took care of the original &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; which had flown over Fort McHenry and had the flag sewn to a piece of sailcloth in order to preserve it.

==Later life and death==
After the war, Preble commanded the steamer , and rescued 600 passengers from the wrecked steamer &quot;Golden Rule&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, the Ramanujan–Soldner constant (also called the Soldner constant) is a mathematical constant defined as the unique positive zero of the logarithmic integral function. It is named after Srinivasa Ramanujan and Johann Georg von Soldner.

Its value is approximately &quot;μ&quot; ≈ 1.45136923488338105028396848589202744949303228… 

Since the logarithmic integral is defined by

:formula_1

then using formula_2 we have

:formula_3

thus easing calculation for numbers greater than &quot;μ&quot;. Also, since the exponential integral function satisfies the equation

:formula_4

the only positive zero of the exponential integral occurs at the natural logarithm of the Ramanujan–Soldner constant, whose value is approximately ln(&quot;μ&quot;) ≈ 0.372507410781366634461991866…

<doc id="459819" wikidata="Q8189446" url="?curid=459819" title="Yufuin, Ōita">
<text>was a town located in Ōita District, Ōita Prefecture, Japan. Yufuin is now a district () within the city of Yufu. Its elevation is approximately 400 meters above ground.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 11,342 and density of 88.77 persons per km2. The total area was 127.77 km2.

On October 1, 2005, Yufuin, along with the towns of Hasama and Shonai (all from Ōita District), was merged to create the city of Yufu. This controversial decision resulted in the recall of the mayor and a snap election in which he regained office.

Located in a green valley beneath the spectacular Mount Yufu (由布岳, &quot;Yufudake&quot;), a short walk from the town centre is a mix of paddy fields, housing and upmarket ryokan, with a few temples. Mount Yufu, or Yufu-dake, can be hiked in about 90 minutes. A common evening sound is the rhythmic ringing of temple bells. Although still connected to its rural roots, Yufuin is a tourist town and a popular destination for coach tours. There is the picturesque Lake Kinrin and rivers flow down and across the valley. Some hotels have outdoor baths called rotenburo with a view of Mount Yufu.

==Hot springs==

Yufuin is famous for natural , resulting in a local economy based on domestic tourism, gift shops and hot-spring bathing. Some &quot;onsen&quot; are available to day tourists, but many are strictly for overnight guests. There are also &quot;sento&quot;, which are the traditional public baths used by locals. One of these, the Shitanyu, can be used by tourists, while the others are for use by local residents only. 

==Sightseeing==

The two-peaked Mount Yufu and Lake Kinrin (金鱗湖, &quot;kinrin-ko&quot;) are commonly viewed and photographed by tourists. Lake Kinrin is known for its fall leaves and the steam that rises from the lake&#x27;s surface on cold mornings. 
Yufuin Floral Village (湯布院フローラルヴィレッジ) is another well-known tourist attraction in Yufuin. It features many small houses (acting as gift shops) modeled after the Cotswolds region of England.

With a suspension in Covid-19-related travel restrictions and the reintroduction of flights connecting Incheon International Airport and Oita Airport in 2024 for the first time in five years, Yufuin has seen a large increase in tourism from South Korea. In December, 2023, 55,000 Korean tourists stayed overnight in Yufuin, more than four times higher than pre-COVID numbers.

<doc id="459835" wikidata="Q7079844" url="?curid=459835" title="Ogata, Ōita">
<text>was a town located in Ōno District, Ōita Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 6,277 and the density of 42.42 persons per km2. The total area was 147.96 km2.

On March 31, 2005, Ogata, along with the towns of Asaji, Inukai, Mie and Ōno, and the villages of Chitose and Kiyokawa (all from Ōno District), was merged to create the city of Bungo-ōno.

==History==
The history of Ogata town is based on ancient Japanese history that includes the legendary hero Ogata no Saburo Koreyoshi. Saburo, feared by many as the &quot;descendent of a giant serpent&quot;, also appears in &quot;the Tale of the Heike&quot; and is said to have contributed greatly to Minamoto no Yoshitsune&#x27;s success in the battle of Dan-no-ura. Ogata town is home to three shrines built by Saburo, called &quot;Ogata Sansha&quot;. Saburo himself is enshrined in one of these, called the &quot;Ninomiya Hachiman Shrine&quot;, where his name is still transmitted to today&#x27;s generation. 
Ogata no Saburo Koreyoshi&#x27;s younger brother Ogata Shuma &quot;Jiraiya&quot; is believed to be the first &quot;Ninjia&quot; in Japanese folklore. 
The legend in the &quot;Heike Tales&quot; refers to Yoshitune&#x27;s decision to lead his armies in Kyūshū. According to Helen Craig McCullough, she references the unique disposition of Minamoto choosing his chief warrior. Ogata no Saburo Koreyoshi commanded the largest armies in Kyūshū and marched in
the name of the future &quot;shōgun&quot; that led to the establishment of the Kamakura period. While establishing the &quot;Ogata&quot; clan-Saburo also built one of the most famous castles in Kyūshū – Oka Castle (ja) for the new &quot;shōgun&quot;. Today Oka Castle remains in ruins after many wars. However, the legacy of Ogata no Saburo Koreyoshi and the establishment of the Ogata clan in Japan was historic.

<doc id="459842" wikidata="Q3247792" url="?curid=459842" title="Pat Summerall">
<text>George Allen &quot;Pat&quot; Summerall (May 10, 1930 – April 16, 2013) was an American professional football player and television sportscaster who worked for CBS, Fox, and ESPN. In addition to football, he announced major golf and tennis events. Summerall announced 16 Super Bowls on network television (more than anyone else), 26 Masters Tournaments, and 21 US Opens. He contributed to 10 Super Bowl broadcasts on CBS Radio as a pregame host or analyst. As of February 5, 2025, his daughter Susie Wiles is President Donald Trump&#x27;s chief of staff.

Summerall played football for the Arkansas Razorbacks and then in the National Football League (NFL) from 1952 through 1961. He was drafted by the Detroit Lions and played with Bobby Layne. His best playing years were as a kicker with the New York Giants. In 1962 he joined CBS as a color commentator. He worked with Tom Brookshier and then John Madden on NFL telecasts for CBS and Fox. Retiring after the 2002 NFL season, he occasionally announced games, especially those near his Texas home.

Summerall was named the National Sportscaster of the Year by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association in 1977, and inducted into its Hall of Fame in 1994. That year, he also received the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award from the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame in 1999. The &quot;Pat Summerall Award&quot; has been presented since 2006 during Super Bowl weekend at the NFL&#x27;s headquarters hotel &quot;to a deserving recipient who through their career has demonstrated the character, integrity and leadership both on and off the job that the name Pat Summerall represents.&quot;

==Football career==

===High school===
At Columbia High School, Lake City, Florida, Summerall played football, tennis, baseball, and basketball. Basketball was his favorite sport; he was recognized as an All-State selection in basketball and football. He was inducted into the FHSAA Hall of Fame and was later named to the FHSAA&#x27;s All-Century Team.

===College===
Summerall played college football from 1949 to 1951 at the University of Arkansas, where he played defensive end, tight end, and placekicker positions for the Arkansas Razorbacks. He graduated in 1953 majoring in Russian history, according to CBS News. 

===Professional===

Summerall spent ten years as a professional football player in the National Football League, primarily as a placekicker. The Detroit Lions drafted Summerall as a fourth-round draft choice in the 1952 NFL draft. Summerall played the pre-season with the Lions before breaking his arm, which ended the year for him. After that season, he was traded and went on to play for the Chicago Cardinals from 1953 to 1957 and the New York Giants from 1958 to 1961, during which he was a part of The Greatest Game Ever Played. His best professional year statistically was 1959, when Summerall scored 90 points on 30-for-30 (100%) extra-point kicking and 20-for-29 (69%) field goal kicking. 

Summerall&#x27;s most memorable professional moment may well have been at the very end of the December 14, 1958 regular-season finale between his Giants and the Cleveland Browns at Yankee Stadium. Going into the game, the Browns were in first place in the Eastern Conference, holding a one-game lead over the second-place Giants. In that era, there was no overtime during regular-season games, standings ties were broken by a playoff, and there were no wild-card teams. This meant that only the Eastern Conference champion would qualify for the NFL Championship Game to be held two weeks later, and it meant that the Giants had to win just to force a tiebreaker playoff game. The Browns, on the other hand, needed only a tie to clinch the Eastern championship. As time was running out, the Giants and Browns were tied, 10–10, a situation that, as indicated, favored the Browns. The Giants got barely into Cleveland territory, then sent out Summerall to try for a tiebreaking 49-yard field goal. To add to the drama, there were swirling winds and snow. Summerall, a straight-ahead kicker, made the field goal with just two minutes to play, keeping the Giants alive for another week (they defeated Cleveland a week later, 10–0, in the Eastern Conference tiebreaker playoff before losing the sudden-death league championship final to Baltimore the week after that).

The Giants&#x27; offensive coach, Vince Lombardi, was against sending Summerall in (Summerall missed a 31-yard attempt a few minutes earlier), then gleefully greeted Summerall as he came off the field, &quot;You son of a bitch, you can’t kick it that far!&quot; &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ran the story as one of its primary articles the next week, with a leading photograph showing the football heading between the uprights through the snow. His last professional game was the December 31, 1961 NFL Championship Game held at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Lombardi&#x27;s Green Bay Packers defeated Summerall&#x27;s Giants, 37–0, holding New York to just six first downs. Summerall was not a factor in that game. 

The urban legend was his nickname became &quot;Pat&quot; because of the abbreviation for &quot;point after touchdown&quot; that a field-goal kicker was credited for in a game summary. But in a 1997 &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; story, Summerall said after his parents divorced, he was taken in by an aunt and uncle who had a son named Mike. &quot;My aunt and uncle just started calling me Pat to go with their Mike&quot;, Summerall would say, referencing frequently named characters in Irish jokes told during that time.

==NFL career statistics==

===Postseason===
==Broadcasting career==
In the early 1960s, Summerall was the morning host on WCBS (AM) radio in New York City. He left the job when WINS went all-news in 1965. He also co-hosted the syndicated NFL Films series &quot;This Week in Pro Football&quot; in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Summerall was also associated with a production company in Dallas from about 1998 through 2005 which was called Pat Summerall Productions. He was featured in and hosted various production shows, such as Summerall Success Stories and Champions of Industry. These qualified production segments would air on the Fox News Channel and later, CNN Headline News. During the mid-1990s, Summerall hosted the &quot;Summerall-Aikman&quot; Cowboys report with quarterback Troy Aikman. Summerall served as the host of &quot;Sports Stars of Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Future Phenoms&quot;, two nationally syndicated high school sports shows based out of Fort Worth, Texas. Following their dismissal of announcer Harry Caray in 1969, the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team considered hiring Summerall to be their new radio voice.

===CBS Sports===

====NFL====
After retiring from football, Summerall was hired by CBS Sports in 1962 to work as a color commentator on the network&#x27;s NFL coverage. CBS initially paired Summerall with Chris Schenkel on Giants games; three years later he shifted to working with Jim Gibbons on Washington Redskins games. In 1968, after CBS abandoned the practice of assigning dedicated announcing crews to particular NFL teams, Summerall ascended to the network&#x27;s lead national crew, pairing with Jack Buck and then Ray Scott. For the postgame coverage of the very first Super Bowl at the end of the 1967 season (which was simulcast by CBS and NBC), the trophy presentation ceremony was handled by CBS&#x27; Summerall (who worked as a reporter, while CBS&#x27; game coverage was called by Ray Scott, Jack Whitaker and Frank Gifford) and NBC&#x27;s George Ratterman.

In 1969, Summerall took part in NBC&#x27;s coverage of Super Bowl III. NBC used Summerall to provide an &quot;NFL perspective&quot; on the coverage. This was due in part to the fact that NBC was at the time, the network television provider of the American Football League (whereas CBS was the network television provider for the pre-merger National Football League). In return, for CBS Radio&#x27;s coverage of Super Bowls I, II and IV, they used Tom Hedrick, normally the radio voice of the Kansas City Chiefs, to provide an &quot;AFL perspective&quot; for their coverage. 

Midway through the 1974 NFL season, CBS shifted Summerall from color to play-by-play. The network&#x27;s #1 NFL crew now consisted of Summerall and analyst Tom Brookshier (with whom he had previously worked on &quot;This Week in Pro Football&quot;), and the colorful Summerall-Brookshier duo worked three Super Bowls (X, XII, and XIV) together. Summerall, Brookshier, &quot;NFL on CBS&quot; producer Bob Wussler, and Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie appeared as themselves during the 1977 film &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, which was filmed on location at the Orange Bowl in Miami during Super Bowl X. 

In 1981, Summerall was teamed with former Oakland Raiders coach John Madden, a pairing that would last for 22 seasons on two networks and become one of the most well-known partnerships in television sportscasting history. Summerall was initially opposed, preferring his longtime broadcast partner (and close friend) Brookshier, but CBS executives wanted more excitement in the booth and thought Brookshier and Summerall working together exacerbated their respective issues with alcohol. Summerall and Madden were first teamed on a November 25, 1979 broadcast of a Minnesota Vikings–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game due to Brookshier having a family commitment. While the two were paired on CBS, they called Super Bowls XVI, XVIII, XXI, XXIV, and XXVI together.

In contrast to John Madden&#x27;s lively, verbose persona, Summerall continued the traditionally minimalist delivery of predecessor as CBS&#x27;s main NFL announcer, Ray Scott. For example, he usually called a Joe Montana to Jerry Rice touchdown pass with simple calls like &quot;Montana...Rice... Touchdown!&quot;

His last game alongside Madden for CBS (before the NFC television contract moved over to Fox) was the 1993 NFC Championship Game (which saw the Dallas Cowboys defeat the San Francisco 49ers in Irving, Texas to go to Super Bowl XXVIII against the Buffalo Bills in Atlanta).

====Other CBS Sports assignments====
Summerall also covered other events such as ABA for CBS during this period. Through 1966, he hosted a morning drive-time music/talk program for WCBS-AM radio in New York.

Summerall also broadcast PGA Tour golf tournaments on CBS, including the Masters Tournament, as well as the US Open of tennis, during his tenure at CBS with Tony Trabert, and he was the play-by-play announcer for the 1974 NBA Finals (working alongside Rick Barry and Rod Hundley), CBS&#x27; first season broadcasting the &quot;NBA on CBS&quot;. In 1975, Summerall hosted the Pan American Games in Mexico, and in 1976 he teamed with Tom Brookshier to call some heavyweight boxing matches for CBS.

Summerall broadcast his first Masters in 1968, when he anchored the coverage at hole 18. In 1983, Summerall replaced Vin Scully (who had left CBS to work for NBC on their Major League Baseball and golf coverage) in the 18th hole tower role (a role that Scully was in since 1975). Summerall&#x27;s broadcast partner during this period was Ken Venturi.

From 1969–1973, Summerall broadcast CBS&#x27; National Invitation Tournament coverage with Don Criqui. In 1985, Summerall once again called college basketball, working NCAA men&#x27;s tournament games for CBS with Larry Conley.

In 1970, Summerall and then-Boston Bruins&#x27; TV announcer Don Earle did a short postgame segment from inside the team&#x27;s dressing room at the end of CBS&#x27; coverage of the fourth (and what turned out to be the final) game of the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals. WSBK-38, the Bruins&#x27; TV flagship at the time, simulcast the CBS coverage and did a longer post-game locker-room segment after CBS&#x27; coverage ended. After Bobby Orr scored the championship-winning goal after just 40 seconds, so the story went, Summerall turned to Bobby&#x27;s father, Doug Orr (who was reportedly, too nervous to go back to his seat from the Bruins&#x27; dressing room for the start of overtime) and yelled over the crowd in the stands above &quot;Mr. Orr, your son has scored and Boston has won the Stanley Cup!&quot; Doug Orr is said to have told Summerall &quot;I know Boston scored, but we didn&#x27;t see it! What makes you think my son scored?&quot; Summerall supposedly replied &quot;Because they wouldn&#x27;t be yelling this loudly if (Phil) Esposito (another high-scoring Boston player of the era) had scored!&quot; 

Summerall also called at least one Professional Bowlers Association event, which was the 1975 Brunswick World Open.

On April 15, 1987, Summerall did color commentary alongside Steve Stone for a Chicago Cubs–Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game on WGN-TV. This was during time period in which the Cubs&#x27; normal television announcer, Harry Caray, was recovering from a stroke. Thus, for about the first two months of the 1987 season, WGN featured a series of celebrity guest announcers on game telecasts while Caray recuperated.

He also broadcast the US Open Tennis Tournament for CBS with Tony Trabert for 25 years.

Summerall&#x27;s last on-air assignment for CBS Sports was the 1994 Masters Tournament. Summerall signed off the broadcast thus, surrounded by the other CBS commentators that were working the tournament:
===Fox Sports===

In 1994, the Fox network surprised NFL fans by outbidding CBS for the NFC broadcast package. One of the network&#x27;s first moves was to hire Summerall and Madden as its lead announcing team. While at Fox, the pair called Super Bowls XXXI, XXXIII, and XXXVI together. The long-time partnership ended after Super Bowl XXXVI in early 2002, as Summerall had announced he would be retiring from announcing and Madden&#x27;s contract had expired.

Between CBS and Fox, Summerall called 11 Super Bowls on television play-by-play, a record matched by Al Michaels with Super Bowl LVI in 2022.

Summerall was lured out of retirement and re-signed with Fox for the 2002 season. However, since Madden had left to take over the color commentator position on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; from Dan Fouts and Dennis Miller for ABC and Fox had promoted Joe Buck to be its number one NFL play-by-play voice (Buck was initially partnered with Cris Collinsworth and, since 2004, Troy Aikman, who both replaced Madden as Fox&#x27;s lead NFL color commentators), Summerall was paired with Brian Baldinger on regional telecasts. Most of the games Summerall covered featured the Dallas Cowboys, due in part to his residency in the city. One of the games Summerall called was the Cowboys&#x27; game against the Seattle Seahawks at Texas Stadium, in which Emmitt Smith broke Walter Payton&#x27;s career rushing yardage record. Summerall was joined by Daryl Johnston, who at the time was working as Fox&#x27;s #2 color man with Dick Stockton and who was a longtime teammate of Smith&#x27;s with the Cowboys, for this game. 

Summerall retired again following the 2002 season but in 2006, he served as a substitute for Kenny Albert alongside Baldinger for the Week 8 (October 29) game between the eventual NFC champion Chicago Bears and the San Francisco 49ers. Summerall returned for one game the following year to take Stockton&#x27;s place alongside Baldinger and provide the play-by-play for the December 9, 2007 game between the Cincinnati Bengals and St. Louis Rams in Cincinnati.

From 2007 until 2010, Summerall appeared as the play-by-play voice of the network&#x27;s coverage of the Cotton Bowl Classic game. Summerall teamed with Brian Baldinger on the 2007–09 Cotton Bowl Classic telecasts, and worked with Daryl Johnston on the 2010 game (his final play-by-play assignment of any kind) between Ole Miss and Oklahoma State. In 2011, Summerall appeared on the pregame coverage of the Cotton Bowl.

===Post-Fox===
In the 2000s, Summerall provided voiceover sponsorship credits for the CBS Masters golf telecasts, and voice-overs for game coverage on NFL Network. He also provided game commentary for the &quot;Golden Tee Golf&quot; video game series and narrated the first episode of the &quot;WrestleMania Rewind&quot; series for the WWE Network (a role that would be assumed by Gary Thorne upon Summerall&#x27;s death).

====&quot;NFL on ESPN&quot;====
Summerall called several preseason and early regular-season NFL games for the ESPN network in 2004, substituting for regular announcer Mike Patrick while the latter recovered from heart surgery.

====&quot;Sports Stars of Tomorrow&quot;====
As previously mentioned, Summerall hosted this syndicated program dedicated to high school and collegiate athletics from 2005 to 2012. Charles Davis assumed hosting duties in 2012.

===Awards and honors===
The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association named Summerall National Sportscaster of the Year in 1977, and inducted him into its Hall of Fame in 1994. Summerall was the 1994 recipient of the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award, bestowed by the Pro Football Hall of Fame &quot;for longtime exceptional contributions to radio and television in professional football&quot;. In 1999, he was inducted into the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame.

Since 2006, the &quot;Pat Summerall Award&quot; has been presented at the annual Legends for Charity Luncheon given on Super Bowl weekend at the NFL&#x27;s headquarters hotel in the host city. The award is given &quot;to a deserving recipient who through their career has demonstrated the character, integrity and leadership both on and off the job that the name Pat Summerall represents.&quot; Recipients have included James Brown (2006), Greg Gumbel (2007), Jim Nantz (2008), Chris Berman (2009), Cris Collinsworth (2010), the entire &quot;Fox NFL&quot; crew (2011), Al Michaels (2012), Archie Manning (2013), Michael Strahan (2014), Joe Buck (2015), John Madden (2016), Rich Eisen (2017), Tony Dungy (2018), Bill Cowher (2019), Jim Kelly (2020), Erin Andrews (2022), Howie Long (2023). No award was given in 2021.
==Outside sports broadcasting==
For many years Summerall was a commercial spokesperson for True Value, often ending advertisements with his tag line &quot;and tell &#x27;em Pat Summerall sent you&quot;. Ironically, his long-time broadcast partner Madden was the spokesperson for Ace Hardware, True Value&#x27;s main competitor in the independent hardware store market. Summerall served as the longtime radio spokesman for the Dux Beds company, a Swedish maker of mattresses, and its &quot;Duxiana&quot; stores.

Summerall started doing work as a commentator for the &quot;Madden NFL&quot; video game franchise in the game &quot;John Madden Football &#x27;92&quot;. His voice was subsequently featured in all the games in the &quot;Madden&quot; franchise from 1994–2002.

Summerall also provided commentary, alongside Madden, on Cartoon Network&#x27;s annual Super Bowl parodies, &quot;The Big Game&quot;, from 1998 through 2001.

Summerall was name-checked on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the episode &quot;Springfield Up&quot;, where his caricature and name appear on the cover of a book held by Homer Simpson titled &quot;Smut Yuks.&quot; Summerall and his partner John Madden also appeared in (and lent their voices to) the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Sunday, Cruddy Sunday&quot;, which premiered following the duo&#x27;s broadcast of Super Bowl XXXIII on Fox in 1999, and on the same night, a caricature of Summerall appeared on the &quot;Family Guy&quot; premiere episode &quot;Death Has a Shadow&quot;, although in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode, he was voiced by Wally Wingert. The pair was also featured in the movie &quot;The Replacements&quot;, calling the games of the Washington Sentinels on their run to the playoffs. Summerall is referenced in the Season 4 &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; episode, &quot;The Lorelais&#x27; First Day at Yale.&quot;

Summerall appeared in the music video for Forever the Sickest Kids&#x27; 2010 single &quot;She Likes (Bittersweet Love)&quot;.

==Personal life==
Summerall was married to Cheri Summerall. With his first wife Katherine (married 1955 - 1995), they had three children, including political consultant and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, and 10 grandchildren.

Summerall was a Christian. In his book, &quot;Summerall: On and Off the Air&quot;, he wrote about his faith and his recovery from alcoholism saying &quot;My thirst for alcohol was replaced by a thirst for knowledge about faith and God. I began reading the Bible regularly at the Betty Ford treatment center, and it became a part of my daily life.&quot;

===Health issues===
During the 1990 season, Summerall was hospitalized with a bleeding ulcer after vomiting on a plane during a flight after a Chicago Bears–Washington Redskins game, and was out for a considerable amount of time. While Verne Lundquist replaced Summerall on games with Madden, Jack Buck (who was at CBS during the time as the network&#x27;s lead Major League Baseball announcer) was added as a regular NFL broadcaster to fill-in.

In the spring of 2004, Summerall, a recovering alcoholic, underwent a liver transplant. Summerall at one point preached a sermon at Travis Avenue Baptist Church in Ft. Worth, Texas.

In 2006, Pat Summerall underwent cataract surgery, and had an intraocular lens implanted.

In January 2008, Summerall had a hip replacement surgery. On June 19, 2008, he was hospitalized for internal bleeding caused by a new medicine he was taking.

In September 2018, James Acho filed a claim against the NFL for football-related dementia on behalf of Cheri Summerall, Summerall&#x27;s widow. The lawsuit was settled a year later.

===Death===
Summerall checked into St. Paul University Hospital in Dallas, Texas, for surgery on a broken hip. He died there on April 16, 2013, of cardiac arrest at age 82. After his death, Jerry Jones referred to Summerall as &quot;royalty in the broadcast booth&quot; while Madden called him &quot;a great broadcaster and a great man&quot; and added that &quot;Pat Summerall is the voice of football and always will be.&quot; Fellow broadcasters Jim Nantz and Verne Lundquist also made statements on Summerall&#x27;s life.

A few days later, CBS Sports presented a tribute to Summerall during their coverage of the RBC Heritage golf event. Nantz and Gary McCord presented highlights of his life and career – both as a player and at CBS – ending with his 1994 Masters sign-off.
During a &quot;Fox NASCAR&quot; broadcast, Chris Myers paid tribute to Summerall on behalf of Fox.

Summerall was interred at the Dallas–Fort Worth National Cemetery.

<doc id="459844" wikidata="Q424074" url="?curid=459844" title="Surface acoustic wave">
<text>A surface acoustic wave (SAW) is an acoustic wave traveling along the surface of a material exhibiting elasticity, with an amplitude that typically decays exponentially with depth into the material, such that they are confined to a depth of about one wavelength.

==Discovery==

SAWs were first explained in 1885 by Lord Rayleigh, who described the surface acoustic mode of propagation and predicted its properties in his classic paper. Named after their discoverer, Rayleigh waves have a longitudinal and a vertical shear component that can couple with any media like additional layers in contact with the surface. This coupling strongly affects the amplitude and velocity of the wave, allowing SAW sensors to directly sense mass and mechanical properties. The term &#x27;Rayleigh waves&#x27; is often used synonymously with &#x27;SAWs&#x27;, although strictly speaking there are multiple types of surface acoustic waves, such as Love waves, which are polarised in the plane of the surface, rather than longitudinal and vertical.

SAWs such as Love and Rayleigh waves tend to propagate for much longer than bulk waves, as they only have to travel in two dimensions, rather than in three. Furthermore, in general they have a lower velocity than their bulk counterparts.

==SAW devices==

Surface acoustic wave devices provide wide-range of applications with the use of electronic system, including delay lines, filters, correlators and DC to DC converters. The possibilities of these SAW device could provide potential field in radar system, communication systems.
===Application in electronic components===

This kind of wave is commonly used in devices called &quot;SAW devices&quot; in electronic circuits. SAW devices are used as filters, oscillators and transformers, devices that are based on the transduction of acoustic waves. The transduction from electric energy to mechanical energy (in the form of SAWs) is accomplished by the use of piezoelectric materials.
Electronic devices employing SAWs normally use one or more interdigital transducers (IDTs) to convert acoustic waves to electrical signals and vice versa by exploiting the piezoelectric effect of certain materials, like quartz, lithium niobate, lithium tantalate, lanthanum gallium silicate, etc. These devices are fabricated by substrate cleaning/treatments like polishing, metallisation, photolithography, and passivation/protection (dielectric) layer manufacturing. These are typical process steps used in manufacturing of semiconductors like silicon integrated circuits.

All parts of the device (substrate, its surface, metallisation material type, thickness of metallisation, its edges formed by photolithography, layers - like passivation coating the metallisation) have effect on the performance of the SAW devices because propagation of Rayleigh waves is highly dependent on the substrate material surface, its quality and all layers in contact with the substrate. For example in SAW filters the sampling frequency is dependent on the width of the IDT fingers, the power handling capability is related to the thickness and materials of the IDT fingers, and the temperature stability depends not only of the temperature behavior of the substrate but also on the metals selected for the IDT electrodes and the possible dielectric layers coating the substrate and the electrodes.

SAW filters are now used in mobile telephones, and provide technical advantages in performance, cost, and size over other filter technologies such as quartz crystals (based on bulk waves), LC filters, and waveguide filters specifically at frequencies below 1.5-2.5 GHz depending on the RF power needed to be filtered. Complementing technology to SAW for frequencies above 1.5-2.5 GHz is based on thin-film bulk acoustic resonators (TFBAR, or FBAR).

Much research has been done in the last 20 years in the area of surface acoustic wave sensors.
Sensor applications include all areas of sensing (such as chemical, optical, thermal, pressure, acceleration, torque and biological). SAW sensors have seen relatively modest commercial success to date, but are commonly commercially available for some applications such as touchscreen displays. They have been successfully applied to torque sensing in motorsport powertrains and high performance aerospace applications as well as temperature sensing in harsh environments such as high voltage electrical power transmission and the combined sensing of torque and temperature on the rotor of electric motors

===SAW device applications in radio and television===

SAW resonators are used in many of the same applications in which quartz crystals are used, because they can operate at higher frequency. They are often used in radio transmitters where tunability is not required. They are often used in applications such as garage door opener remote controls, short range radio frequency links for computer peripherals, and other devices where channelization is not required. Where a radio link might use several channels, quartz crystal oscillators are more commonly used to drive a phase locked loop. Since the resonant frequency of a SAW device is set by the mechanical properties of the crystal, it does not drift as much as a simple LC oscillator, where conditions such as capacitor performance and battery voltage will vary substantially with temperature and age.

SAW filters are also often used in radio receivers, as they can have precisely determined and narrow passbands. This is helpful in applications where a single antenna must be shared between a transmitter and a receiver operating at closely spaced frequencies. SAW filters are also frequently used in television receivers, for extracting subcarriers from the signal; until the analog switchoff, the extraction of digital audio subcarriers from the intermediate frequency strip of a television receiver or video recorder was one of the main markets for SAW filters.

Early pioneer Jeffery Collins incorporated surface acoustic wave devices in a Skynet receiver he developed in the 1970s. It synchronised signals faster than existing technology.

They are also often used in digital receivers, and are well suited to superhet applications. This is because the intermediate frequency signal is always at a fixed frequency after the local oscillator has been mixed with the received signal, and so a filter with a fixed frequency and high Q provides excellent removal of unwanted or interference signals.

In these applications, SAW filters are almost always used with a phase locked loop synthesized local oscillator, or a varicap driven oscillator.

==SAW in geophysics==

In seismology surface acoustic waves could become the most destructive type of seismic wave produced by earthquakes, which propagate in more complex media, such as ocean bottom, rocks, etc. so that it need to be noticed and monitored by people to protect living environment.

== SAW in quantum acoustics ==
SAWs play a key role in the field of quantum acoustics (QA) where, in contrast to quantum optics (QO) which studies the interaction between matter and light, the interaction between quantum systems (phonons, (quasi-)particles and artificial qubits) and acoustic waves is analysed. The propagation speed of the respective waves of QA is five orders of magnitude slower than that of QO. As a result, QA offers a different perspective of the quantum regime in terms of wavelengths which QO has not covered. One example of these additions is the quantum optical investigation of qubits and quantum dots fabricated in such a way as to emulate essential aspects of natural atoms, e.g. energy-level structures and coupling to an electromagnetic field. These artificial atoms are arranged into a circuit dubbed ‘giant atoms’, due to its size reaching 10−4–10−3 m. Quantum optical experiments generally made use of microwave fields for matter-light interaction, but because of the difference of wavelength between the giant atoms and microwave fields, the latter of which has a wavelength ranging between 10−2–10−1 m, SAWs were used instead for their more suitable wavelength (10−6 m).

Within the fields of magnonics and spintronics, a resonant coupling between spin waves and surface acoustic waves with equal wave-vector and frequency allows for the transfer of energy from one form to another, in either direction. This can for example be useful in the construction of magnetic field sensors, which are sensitive to both the intensity and direction of external magnetic fields. These sensors, constructed using a structure of magnetostrictive and piezoelectric layers have the benefit of operating without batteries and wires, as well as having a broad range of operating conditions, such as high temperatures or rotating systems.

=== Single electron control ===

Even at the smallest scales of current semiconductor technology, each operation is carried out by huge streams of electrons. Reducing the number of electrons involved in these processes, with the ultimate goal of achieving single electron control is a serious challenge. This is due to the electrons being highly interactive with each other and their surroundings, making it difficult to separate just one from the rest. The use of SAWs can help with achieving this goal. When SAWs are generated on a piezoelectric surface, the strain wave generates an electromagnetic potential. The potential minima can then trap single electrons, allowing them to be individually transported. Although this technique was first thought of as a way to accurately define a standard unit of current, it turned out to be more useful in the field of quantum information. Usually, qubits are stationary, making the transfer of information between them difficult. The single electrons, carried by the SAWs, can be used as so called flying qubits, able to transport information from one place to another. To realise this a single electron source is needed, as well as a receiver between which the electron can be transported. Quantum dots (QD) are typically used for these stationary electron confinements. This potential minimum is sometimes called a SAW QD. The process, as seen in the GIF on the right, is typically as follows. First SAWs are generated with an interdigital transducer with specific dimensions between the electrodes to get the favorable wavelengths. Then from the stationary QD the electron quantum tunnels to the potential minimum, or SAW QD. The SAWs transfer some kinetic energy to the electron, driving it forward. It is then carried through a one dimensional channel on a surface of piezoelectric semiconductor material like GaAs. Finally, the electron tunnels out of the SAW QD and into the receiver QD, after which the transfer is complete. This process can also be repeated in both directions.

== SAW and 2D materials ==
As acoustic vibrations can interact with the moving charges in a piezoelectric semiconductor through the strain-induced piezoelectric field in bulk materials, this acoustoelectric (AE) coupling is also important in 2D materials, such as graphene. In these 2D materials the two-dimensional electron gas has band gap energies generally much higher than the energy of the SAW phonons traveling through the material. Therefore the SAW phonons are typically absorbed via intra-band electronic transitions. In graphene these transitions are the only way, as the linear dispersion relation of its electrons prevents momentum/energy conservation when it would absorb a SAW for an inter-band transition.

Often the interaction between moving charges and SAWs results in the diminishing of the SAW intensity as it moves through the 2D electron gas, as well as re-normalizing the SAW velocity. The charges take over kinetic energy from the SAW and lose this energy again through carrier scattering.

Aside from SAW intensity attenuation, there are specific situations in which the wave can be amplified as well. By applying a voltage over the material, the charge carriers may obtain a higher drift speed than the SAW. Then they pass on a part of their kinetic energy to the SAW, causing it to amplify its intensity and velocity. The converse works as well. If the SAW is moving faster than the carriers, it may transfer kinetic energy to them, and thereby losing some velocity and intensity.

==SAW in microfluidics==
In recent years, attention has been drawn to using SAWs to drive microfluidic actuation and a variety of other processes. Owing to the mismatch of sound velocities in the SAW substrate and fluid, SAWs can be efficiently transferred into the fluid, creating significant inertial forces and fluid velocities. This mechanism can be exploited to drive fluid actions such as pumping, mixing, and jetting.[8] To drive these processes, there is a change of mode of the wave at the liquid-substrate interface. In the substrate, the SAW wave is a transverse wave and upon entering the droplet the wave becomes a longitudinal wave.[9] It is this longitudinal wave that creates the flow of fluid within the microfluidic droplet, allowing mixing to take place. This technique can be used as an alternative to microchannels and microvalves for manipulation of substrates, allowing for an open system.

This mechanism has also been used in droplet-based microfluidics for droplet manipulation. Notably, using SAW as an actuation mechanism, droplets were pushed towards two or more outlets for sorting. Moreover, SAWs were used for droplet size modulation, splitting, trapping, tweezing, and nanofluidic pipetting. Droplet impact on flat and inclined surfaces has been manipulated and controlled using SAW.

PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) is a material that can be used to create microchannels and microfluidic chips. It has many uses, including in experiments where living cells are to be tested or processed. If living organisms need to be kept alive, it is important to monitor and control their environment, such as heat and pH levels; however, if these elements are not regulated, the cells may die or it may result in unwanted reactions. PDMS has been found to absorb acoustic energy, causing the PDMS to heat up quickly (exceeding 2000 Kelvin/second). The use of SAW as a way to heat these PDMS devices, along with liquids inside microchannels, is now a technique that can be done in a controlled manner with the ability to manipulate the temperature to within 0.1 °C.

The development of Flexible Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) devices has been a significant driver in the advancement of wearable technology and microfluidic systems. These devices are typically fabricated on polymer substrates, such as Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN) and polyimide, and utilize sputtering deposition of materials like AlN and ZnO. This combination of flexibility and advanced materials has expanded their application potential across various fields.

==SAW in flow measurement==
Surface acoustic waves can be used for flow measurement. SAW relies on the propagation of a wave front, which appears similar to seismic activities. The waves are generated at the excitation centre and spread out along the surface of a solid material. An electric pulse induces them to generate SAWs that propagate like the waves of an earthquake. Interdigital transducer acts as sender and as receiver. When one is in sender mode, the two most distant ones act as receivers. The SAWs travel along the surface of the measuring tube, but a portion will couple out to the liquid. The decoupling angle depends on the liquid respectively the propagation velocity of the wave which is specific to the liquid. On the other side of the measuring tube, portions of the wave will couple into the tube and continue their way along its surface to the next interdigital transducer. Another portion will be coupled out again and travels back to the other side of the measuring tube where the effect repeats itself and the transducer on this side detects the wave. That means excitation of any one transducer here will lead to a sequence of input signals on two other transducers in the distance. Two of the transducers send their signals in the direction of flow, two in the other direction.

<doc id="459847" wikidata="Q13512320" url="?curid=459847" title="Email spam">
<text>Email spam, also referred to as junk email, spam mail, or simply spam, refers to unsolicited messages sent in bulk via email. The term originates from a Monty Python sketch, where the name of a canned meat product, &quot;Spam,&quot; is used repetitively, mirroring the intrusive nature of unwanted emails. Since the early 1990s, spam has grown significantly, with estimates suggesting that by 2014, it comprised around 90% of all global email traffic.

Spam is primarily a financial burden for the recipient, who may be required to manage, filter, or delete these unwanted messages. Since the expense of spam is mostly borne by the recipient, it is effectively a form of &quot;postage due&quot; advertising, where the recipient bears the cost of unsolicited messages. This cost imposed on recipients, without compensation from the sender, makes spam an example of a &quot;negative externality&quot; (a side effect of an activity that affects others who are not involved in the decision). 

The legal definition and status of spam varies from one jurisdiction to another, but nowhere have laws and lawsuits been particularly successful in stemming spam.

Most email spam messages are commercial in nature. Whether commercial or not, many are not only annoying as a form of attention theft, but also dangerous because they may contain links that lead to phishing web sites or sites that are hosting malware or include malware as file attachments.

Spammers collect email addresses from chat rooms, websites, customer lists, newsgroups, and viruses that harvest users&#x27; address books. These collected email addresses are sometimes also sold to other spammers.

==Overview==
At the beginning of the Internet (the ARPANET), sending of commercial email was prohibited. Gary Thuerk sent the first email spam message in 1978 to 600 people. He was reprimanded and told not to do it again. Now the ban on spam is enforced by the Terms of Service/Acceptable Use Policy (ToS/AUP) of internet service providers (ISPs) and peer pressure.

Spam is sent by both otherwise reputable organizations and lesser companies. When spam is sent by otherwise reputable companies it is sometimes referred to as &quot;Mainsleaze&quot;. Mainsleaze makes up approximately 3% of the spam sent over the internet.

===Spamvertised sites===
Many spam emails contain URLs to a website or websites. According to a Cyberoam report in 2014, there are an average of 54 billion spam messages sent every day. &quot;Pharmaceutical products (Viagra and the like) jumped up 45% from last quarter’s analysis, leading this quarter’s spam pack. Emails purporting to offer jobs with fast, easy cash come in at number two, accounting for approximately 15% of all spam email. And, rounding off at number three are spam emails about diet products (such as Garcinia gummi-gutta or Garcinia Cambogia), accounting for approximately 1%.&quot;

Spam is also a medium for fraudsters to scam users into entering personal information on fake Web sites using emails forged to look like they are from banks or other organizations, such as PayPal. This is known as &quot;phishing&quot;. Targeted phishing, where known information about the recipient is used to create forged emails, is known as &quot;spear-phishing&quot;.

==Spam techniques==

===Appending===
If a marketer has one database containing names, addresses, and telephone numbers of customers, they can pay to have their database matched against an external database containing email addresses. The company then has the means to send email to people who have not requested email, which may include people who have deliberately withheld their email address.

===Image spam===
Image spam, or image-based spam, is an obfuscation method by which text of the message is stored as a GIF or JPEG image and displayed in the email. This prevents text-based spam filters from detecting and blocking spam messages. Image spam was reportedly used in the mid-2000s to advertise &quot;pump and dump&quot; stocks.

Often, image spam contains nonsensical, computer-generated text which simply annoys the reader. However, new technology in some programs tries to read the images by attempting to find text in these images. These programs are not very accurate, and sometimes filter out innocent images of products, such as a box that has words on it.

A newer technique, however, is to use an animated GIF image that does not contain clear text in its initial frame, or to contort the shapes of letters in the image (as in CAPTCHA) to avoid detection by optical character recognition tools.

===Blank spam===
Blank spam is spam lacking a payload advertisement. Often the message body is missing altogether, as well as the subject line. Still, it fits the definition of spam because of its nature as bulk and unsolicited email.

Blank spam may be originated in different ways, either intentional or unintentionally:
# Blank spam can have been sent in a directory harvest attack, a form of dictionary attack for gathering valid addresses from an email service provider. Since the goal in such an attack is to use the bounces to separate invalid addresses from the valid ones, spammers may dispense with most elements of the header and the entire message body, and still accomplish their goals.
# Blank spam may also occur when a spammer forgets or otherwise fails to add the payload when they set up the spam run.
# Often blank spam headers appear truncated, suggesting that computer glitches, such as software bugs or other may have contributed to this problem—from poorly written spam software to malfunctioning relay servers, or any problems that may truncate header lines from the message body.
# Some spam may appear to be blank when in fact it is not. An example of this is the VBS.Davinia.B email worm which propagates through messages that have no subject line and appears blank, when in fact it uses HTML code to download other files.

===Backscatter spam===

Backscatter is a side-effect of email spam, viruses, and worms. It happens when email servers are misconfigured to send a bogus bounce message to the envelope sender when rejecting or quarantining email (rather than simply rejecting the attempt to send the message).

If the sender&#x27;s address was forged, then the bounce may go to an innocent party. Since these messages were not solicited by the recipients, are substantially similar to each other, and are delivered in bulk quantities, they qualify as unsolicited bulk email or spam. As such, systems that generate email backscatter can end up being listed on various DNSBLs and be in violation of internet service providers&#x27; Terms of Service.

==Legal countermeasures==

If an individual or organisation can identify harm done to them by spam, and identify who sent it; then they may be able to sue for a legal remedy, e.g. on the basis of trespass to chattels. A number of large civil settlements have been won in this way, although others have been mostly unsuccessful in collecting damages.

Criminal prosecution of spammers under fraud or computer crime statutes is also common, particularly if they illegally accessed other computers to create botnets, or the emails were phishing or other forms of criminal fraud.

Finally, in most countries specific legislation is in place to make certain forms of spamming a criminal offence, as outlined below:

===European Union===
Article 13 of the European Union Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (2002/58/EC) provides that the EU member states shall take appropriate measures to ensure that unsolicited communications for the purposes of direct marketing are not allowed either without the consent of the subscribers concerned or in respect of subscribers who do not wish to receive these communications, the choice between these options to be determined by national legislation.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, for example, unsolicited emails cannot be sent to an individual subscriber unless prior permission has been obtained or unless there is a pre-existing commercial relationship between the parties.

===Canada===
The 2010 Fighting Internet and Wireless Spam Act (which took effect in 2014) is Canadian legislation meant to fight spam.

===Australia===
The Spam Act 2003, which covers some types of email and phone spam. Penalties are up to 10,000 penalty units, or 2,000 penalty units for a person other than a body corporate.

===United States===
In the United States, many states enacted anti-spam laws during the late 1990s and early 2000s. All of these were subsequently superseded by the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, which was in many cases less restrictive. CAN-SPAM also preempted any further state legislation, but it left related laws not specific to e-mail intact. Courts have ruled that spam can constitute, for example, trespass to chattels.

Bulk commercial email does not violate CAN-SPAM, provided that it meets certain criteria, such as a truthful subject line, no forged information in the headers. If it fails to comply with any of these requirements it is illegal. Those opposing spam greeted the new law with dismay and disappointment, almost immediately dubbing it the &quot;You Can Spam&quot; Act.

In practice, it had a little positive impact. In 2004, less than one percent of spam complied with CAN-SPAM, although a 2005 review by the Federal Trade Commission claimed that the amount of sexually explicit spam had significantly decreased since 2003 and the total volume had begun to level off. Many other observers viewed it as having failed, although there have been several high-profile prosecutions.

==Deception and fraud==
Spammers may engage in deliberate fraud to send out their messages. Spammers often use false names, addresses, phone numbers, and other contact information to set up &quot;disposable&quot; accounts at various Internet service providers. They also often use falsified or stolen credit card numbers to pay for these accounts. This allows them to move quickly from one account to the next as the host ISPs discover and shut down each one.

Senders may go to great lengths to conceal the origin of their messages. Large companies may hire another firm to send their messages so that complaints or blocking of email falls on a third party. Others engage in spoofing of email addresses (much easier than IP address spoofing). The email protocol (SMTP) has no authentication by default, so the spammer can pretend to originate a message apparently from any email address. To prevent this, some ISPs and domains require the use of SMTP-AUTH, allowing positive identification of the specific account from which an email originates.

Senders cannot completely spoof email delivery chains (the &#x27;Received&#x27; header), since the receiving mailserver records the actual connection from the last mailserver&#x27;s IP address. To counter this, some spammers forge additional delivery headers to make it appear as if the email had previously traversed many legitimate servers.

Spoofing can have serious consequences for legitimate email users. Not only can their email inboxes get clogged up with &quot;undeliverable&quot; emails in addition to volumes of spam, but they can mistakenly be identified as a spammer. Not only may they receive irate email from spam victims, but (if spam victims report the email address owner to the ISP, for example) a naïve ISP may terminate their service for spamming.

==Theft of service==
Spammers frequently seek out and make use of vulnerable third-party systems such as open mail relays and open proxy servers. SMTP forwards mail from one server to another—mail servers that ISPs run commonly require some form of authentication to ensure that the user is a customer of that ISP.

Increasingly, spammers use networks of malware-infected PCs (zombies) to send their spam. Zombie networks are also known as botnets (such zombifying malware is known as a &quot;bot&quot;, short for robot). In June 2006, an estimated 80 percent of email spam was sent by zombie PCs, an increase of 30 percent from the prior year. An estimated 55 billion email spam were sent each day in June 2006, an increase of 25 billion per day from June 2005.

For the first quarter of 2010, an estimated 305,000 newly activated zombie PCs were brought online each day for malicious activity. This number is slightly lower than the 312,000 of the fourth quarter of 2009.

Brazil produced the most zombies in the first quarter of 2010. Brazil was the source of 20 percent of all zombies, which is down from 14 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009. India had 10 percent, with Vietnam at 8 percent, and the Russian Federation at 7 percent.

===Side effects===
To combat the problems posed by botnets, open relays, and proxy servers, many email server administrators pre-emptively block dynamic IP ranges and impose stringent requirements on other servers wishing to deliver mail. Forward-confirmed reverse DNS must be correctly set for the outgoing mail server and large swaths of IP addresses are blocked, sometimes pre-emptively, to prevent spam. These measures can pose problems for those wanting to run a small email server off an inexpensive domestic connection. Blacklisting of IP ranges due to spam emanating from them also causes problems for legitimate email servers in the same IP range.

==Statistics and estimates==
The total volume of email spam has been consistently growing, but in 2011 the trend seemed to reverse. The amount of spam that users see in their mailboxes is only a portion of total spam sent, since spammers&#x27; lists often contain a large percentage of invalid addresses and many spam filters simply delete or reject &quot;obvious spam&quot;.

The first known spam email, advertising a DEC product presentation, was sent in 1978 by Gary Thuerk to 600 addresses, the total number of users on ARPANET was 2600 at the time though software limitations meant only slightly more than half of the intended recipients actually received it. As of August 2010, the number of spam messages sent per day was estimated to be around 200 billion. More than 97% of all emails sent over the Internet in 2008 were unwanted, according to a Microsoft security report. MAAWG estimates that 85% of incoming mail is &quot;abusive email&quot;, as of the second half of 2007. The sample size for the MAAWG&#x27;s study was over 100 million mailboxes. In 2018 with growing affiliation networks &amp; email frauds worldwide about 90% of global email traffic is spam as per IPwarmup.com study, which also effects legitimate email senders to achieve inbox delivery.

A 2010 survey of US and European email users showed that 46% of the respondents had opened spam messages, although only 11% had clicked on a link.

In 2023, 160 billion spam messages were sent every day. The US sends the most spam messages (8 billion per day), followed by China (7.6 billion per day). The main topic is delivery service messages (in the US in the first half of 2023 more than 1.1 billion).

===Highest amount of spam received===
According to Steve Ballmer in 2004, Microsoft founder Bill Gates receives four million emails per year, most of them spam. This was originally incorrectly reported as &quot;per day&quot;.

At the same time Jef Poskanzer, owner of the domain name acme.com, was receiving over one million spam emails per day.

===Cost of spam===
A 2004 survey estimated that lost productivity costs Internet users in the United States $21.58 billion annually, while another reported the cost at $17 billion, up from $11 billion in 2003. In 2004, the worldwide productivity cost of spam has been estimated to be $50 billion in 2005.

In 2023, 56.2 million people lost a total of $25.4 billion, with victims losing an average of $452. The amount lost and the number of victims has increased significantly over the past decade, with 18 million people losing a total of $8.6 billion in 2014. 

===Origin of spam===

Because of the international nature of spam, the spammer, the hijacked spam-sending computer, the spamvertised server, and the user target of the spam are all often located in different countries. As much as 80% of spam received by Internet users in North America and Europe can be traced to fewer than 200 spammers.

In terms of volume of spam: According to Sophos, the major sources of spam in the fourth quarter of 2008 (October to December) were:

*The United States (the origin of 19.8% of spam messages, up from 18.9% in Q3)
*China (9.9%, up from 5.4%)
*Russia (6.4%, down from 8.3%)
*Brazil (6.3%, up from 4.5%)
*Turkey (4.4%, down from 8.2%)

When grouped by continents, spam comes mostly from:
*Asia (37.8%, down from 39.8%)
*North America (23.6%, up from 21.8%)
*Europe (23.4%, down from 23.9%)
*South America (12.9%, down from 13.2%)

In terms of number of IP addresses: the Spamhaus Project ranks the top three as the United States, China, and Russia, followed by Japan, Canada, and South Korea.

In terms of networks: , the three networks hosting the most spammers are ChinaNet, Amazon, and Airtel India.

==Anti-spam techniques==
The U.S. Department of Energy Computer Incident Advisory Capability (CIAC) has provided specific countermeasures against email spamming.

Some popular methods for filtering and refusing spam include email filtering based on the content of the email, DNS-based blackhole lists (DNSBL), greylisting, spamtraps, enforcing technical requirements of email (SMTP), checksumming systems to detect bulk email, and by putting some sort of cost on the sender via a proof-of-work system or a micropayment. Each method has strengths and weaknesses and each is controversial because of its weaknesses. For example, one company&#x27;s offer to &quot;[remove] some spamtrap and honeypot addresses&quot; from email lists defeats the ability for those methods to identify spammers.

Outbound spam protection combines many of the techniques to scan messages exiting out of a service provider&#x27;s network, identify spam, and taking action such as blocking the message or shutting off the source of the message.

Email authentication to prevent &quot;From:&quot; address spoofing became popular in the 2010s.

=== Collateral damage ===

Measures to protect against spam can cause collateral damage. This includes:

*The measures may consume resources, both in the server and on the network.
*When legitimate messages are rejected, the sender needs to contact the recipient out of channel.
*When legitimate messages are relegated to a spam folder, the sender is not notified of this.
*If a recipient periodically checks their spam folder, that will cost them time and if there is a lot of spam it is easy to overlook the few legitimate messages.

==Methods of spammers==
===Gathering of addresses===
In order to send spam, spammers need to obtain the email addresses of the intended recipients. To this end, both spammers themselves and &quot;list merchants&quot; gather huge lists of potential email addresses. Since spam is, by definition, unsolicited, this &quot;address harvesting&quot; is done without the consent (and sometimes against the expressed will) of the address owners. A single spam run may target tens of millions of possible addresses – many of which are invalid, malformed, or undeliverable.

===Obfuscating message content===
Many spam-filtering techniques work by searching for patterns in the headers or bodies of messages. For instance, a user may decide that all email they receive with the word &quot;Viagra&quot; in the subject line is spam, and instruct their mail program to automatically delete all such messages. To defeat such filters, the spammer may intentionally misspell commonly filtered words or insert other characters, often in a style similar to leetspeak, as in the following examples: , , , , . This also allows for many different ways to express a given word, making identifying them all more difficult for filter software.

The principle of this method is to leave the word readable to humans (who can easily recognize the intended word for such misspellings), but not likely to be recognized by a computer program. This is only somewhat effective, because modern filter patterns have been designed to recognize blacklisted terms in the various iterations of misspelling. Other filters target the actual obfuscation methods, such as the non-standard use of punctuation or numerals into unusual places. Similarly, HTML-based email gives the spammer more tools to obfuscate text. Inserting HTML comments between letters can foil some filters. Another common ploy involves presenting the text as an image, which is either sent along or loaded from a remote server.

===Defeating Bayesian filters ===
As Bayesian filtering has become popular as a spam-filtering technique, spammers have started using methods to weaken it. To a rough approximation, Bayesian filters rely on word probabilities. If a message contains many words that are used only in spam, and few that are never used in spam, it is likely to be spam. To weaken Bayesian filters, some spammers, alongside the sales pitch, now include lines of irrelevant, random words, in a technique known as Bayesian poisoning. More broadly machine learning can be used to identify and filter spam. There is a game of escalation between spammers and anti-spam identification and filtering systems where spammers adjust to attempt to evade new identification and filtering techniques.

===Spam-support services===
A number of other online activities and business practices are considered by anti-spam activists to be connected to spamming. These are sometimes termed spam-support services: business services, other than the actual sending of spam itself, which permit the spammer to continue operating. Spam-support services can include processing orders for goods advertised in spam, hosting Web sites or DNS records referenced in spam messages, or a number of specific services as follows:

Some Internet hosting firms advertise bulk-friendly or bulletproof hosting. This means that, unlike most ISPs, they will not terminate a customer for spamming. These hosting firms operate as clients of larger ISPs, and many have eventually been taken offline by these larger ISPs as a result of complaints regarding spam activity. Thus, while a firm may advertise bulletproof hosting, it is ultimately unable to deliver without the connivance of its upstream ISP. However, some spammers have managed to get what is called a pink contract (see below) – a contract with the ISP that allows them to spam without being disconnected.

A few companies produce spamware, or software designed for spammers. Spamware varies widely, but may include the ability to import thousands of addresses, to generate random addresses, to insert fraudulent headers into messages, to use dozens or hundreds of mail servers simultaneously, and to make use of open relays. The sale of spamware is illegal in eight U.S. states.

So-called millions CDs are commonly advertised in spam. These are CD-ROMs purportedly containing lists of email addresses, for use in sending spam to these addresses. Such lists are also sold directly online, frequently with the false claim that the owners of the listed addresses have requested (or &quot;opted in&quot;) to be included. Such lists often contain invalid addresses. In recent years, these have fallen almost entirely out of use due to the low quality email addresses available on them, and because some email lists exceed 20GB in size. The amount you can fit on a CD is no longer substantial.

A number of DNS blacklists (DNSBLs), including the MAPS RBL, Spamhaus SBL, SORBS and SPEWS, target the providers of spam-support services as well as spammers. DNSBLs blacklist IPs or ranges of IPs to persuade ISPs to terminate services with known customers who are spammers or resell to spammers.

==Related vocabulary==
;Unsolicited bulk email (UBE)
:A synonym for email spam.
;Unsolicited commercial email (UCE)
:Spam promoting a commercial service or product. This is the most common type of spam, but it excludes spams that are hoaxes (e.g. virus warnings), political advocacy, religious messages, and chain letters sent by a person to many other people. The term UCE may be most common in the USA.
;Pink contract
:A pink contract is a service contract offered by an ISP which offers bulk email service to spamming clients, in violation of that ISP&#x27;s publicly posted acceptable use policy.
;Spamvertising
:Spamvertising is advertising through the medium of spam.
;Opt-in, confirmed opt-in, double opt-in, opt-out
:Opt-in, confirmed opt-in, double opt-in, opt-out refers to whether the people on a mailing list are given the option to be put in, or taken out, of the list. Confirmation (and &quot;double&quot;, in marketing speak) refers to an email address transmitted e.g. through a web form being confirmed to actually request joining a mailing list, instead of being added to the list without verification.
;Final, Ultimate Solution for the Spam Problem (FUSSP)
:An ironic reference to naïve developers who believe they have invented the perfect spam filter, which will stop all spam from reaching users&#x27; inboxes while deleting no legitimate email accidentally.

<doc id="459850" wikidata="Q27394" url="?curid=459850" title="Southern Africa">
<text>Southern Africa is the southernmost region of Africa. No definition is agreed upon, but some groupings include the United Nations geoscheme, the intergovernmental Southern African Development Community, and the physical geography definition based on the physical characteristics of the land. The most restrictive definition considers the region of Southern Africa to consist of Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and South Africa, while other definitions also include several other countries from the area.

Defined by physical geography, Southern Africa is home to a number of river systems; the Zambezi River is the most prominent. The Zambezi flows from the northwest corner of Zambia and western Angola to the Indian Ocean on the coast of Mozambique. Along the way, it flows over Victoria Falls on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. Victoria Falls is one of the largest waterfalls in the world and a major tourist attraction for the region.

Southern Africa includes both subtropical and temperate climates, with the Tropic of Capricorn running through the middle of the region, dividing it into its subtropical and temperate halves. Countries commonly included in Southern Africa include Angola, Botswana, the Comoros, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. In cultural geography, the island country of Madagascar is often not included due to its distinct language and cultural heritage.

Southern Africa has a more developed economy and infrastructure compared to the other regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, having a robust mining sector, comparatively developed secondary and tertiary sectors, and a strong manufacturing sector. Nevertheless, the region continues to struggle with inequality, crime, poverty, and with the epidemic of HIV/AIDS in Africa, with Eswatini, Lesotho, Botswana, South Africa and Namibia having the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the world.

==Definitions and usage==
In physical geography, the geographical delineation for the subregion is the portion of Africa south of the Cunene and Zambezi Rivers: Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and the part of Mozambique that lies south of the Zambezi River. That definition is most often used in South Africa for natural sciences and particularly in guidebooks such as &quot;Roberts&#x27; Birds of Southern Africa&quot;, the Southern African Bird Atlas Project, and &quot;Mammals of the Southern African Subregion&quot;. It is not used in political, economic, or human geography contexts because the definition cuts Mozambique in two.

=== UN scheme of geographic regions and the SACU ===
In the United Nations geoscheme for Africa, five states constitute Southern Africa:
* (Swaziland)
* 
This definition excludes other countries in the region, and instead includes the Comoros, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mayotte, Mozambique, Réunion, the Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean (as a part of the French Southern Territories), Zambia, and Zimbabwe in Eastern Africa, Angola in Middle Africa (or Central Africa), and Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha (under the name Saint Helena) in Western Africa, instead. Some atlases include Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe in Central Africa instead of Southern or Eastern Africa.

The Southern African Customs Union, created in 1969, also comprises the five states in the UN subregion of Southern Africa.

===SADC membership===
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) was established in 1980 to facilitate co-operation in the region. It includes:
* 
* 
* (Swaziland)
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

===General usage===
Other than the UN subregion, these countries and territories are often included in Southern Africa:
* 
** 
** Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean
* 
* 
**
* 

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is generally included in Central Africa, while Seychelles and Tanzania are more commonly associated with Eastern Africa, but these three countries have occasionally been included in Southern Africa, as they are the SADC members.

==Geography==

The terrain of Southern Africa is varied, ranging from forest and grasslands to deserts. The region has both low-lying coastal areas, and mountains.

In terms of natural resources, the region has the world&#x27;s largest resources of platinum and the platinum group elements, chromium, vanadium, and cobalt, as well as uranium, gold, copper, titanium, iron, manganese, silver, beryllium, and diamonds.

Southern Africa is set apart from other Sub-Saharan African regions because of its mineral resources, including copper, diamonds, gold, zinc, chromium, platinum, manganese, iron ore, and coal. Countries in Southern Africa are larger in geographic area, except three smaller landlocked states: Lesotho, Swaziland, and Malawi. The larger states- South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia, and Angola—all have extensive mineral deposits.

These widespread mineral resources make this one of the wealthiest regions of Africa with the greatest potential for economic growth. A chain of mineral resources in Southern Africa stretches from the rich oil fields in northwest Angola, east through the central diamond-mining region in Huambo Province, and into the Copper Belt region of Zambia and Congo. A region of rich mineral deposits continues to the south called the Great Dyke in central Zimbabwe, through the Bushveld basin into South Africa. This extends southwest through the Witwatersrand and Northern Cape of South Africa toward the southern coast. Mining activity exists across the eastern region. Diamond mining is found in parts of Botswana and along the Namibian coast. Coal can also be found in central Mozambique, Zimbabwe and northeast South Africa.

==Climate==

The climate of the region is broadly divided into subtropical in the north and temperate in the south, but also includes humid-subtropical, Mediterranean-climate, highland-subtropical, oceanic, desert, and semi-arid regions. Except for lower parts of Zambia and interior areas of Namibia and Botswana, the region rarely suffers from extreme heat. In addition, the winter presents mostly as mild and dry, except in the southwest. Cool southeasterly winds and high humidity bring cool conditions in the winter. The Namib Desert is the driest area in the region.

Altitude plays an outsize role in moderating the temperatures of the South African Highveld, Lesotho, and much of Zambia and Zimbabwe. The prairie region of central and northeast South Africa, the country of Zimbabwe, and parts of Zambia are known as the veldt, divided into the Bushveld and Highveld. There are high temperatures and low rainfall within the Zambezi and Limpopo river valleys, probably due to the lower altitude.

The Western Cape has a Mediterranean vegetation and climate, including the unique fynbos, grading eastward into an oceanic climate along the Garden Route to Gqeberha and East London. The Namib and Kalahari deserts form arid lands in the centre-west, separating the highlands, woodlands, croplands, and pastures of the wetter and higher East from the Atlantic Ocean. In addition, the Drakensberg and Eastern Highlands separate the highland areas and coastal plains centred on Mozambique in the north and KwaZulu-Natal in the south, the latter of which are often prone to flooding every few years. In the east, the river systems of the Zambezi and Limpopo basin form natural barriers and sea lanes between Mozambique, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.

Across most of southern Africa, apart from the Western Cape in South Africa, the major rainfall season is during the southern-hemisphere summer, from December to February. In the Western Cape, the rainfall maximum occurs from June through August.

There are a number of important rainfall-producing weather systems in southern Africa. These include tropical-extra-tropical cloud bands, tropical lows, and tropical cyclones, cut-off lows, and mesoscale convective systems. Winter midlatitude storms account for the June–August rainfall maximum in the western cape.

Year-to-year variability in rainfall, including drought, is associated with changes in global and regional sea surface temperatures. These include the El Nino Southern Oscillation, the Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole, and changes in the Benguela Current region in the southeast Atlantic.

Future climate projections suggest that much of southern Africa will get hotter and drier in response to global climate change.

==History==

===Prehistory===
East and southern Africa are among the earliest regions where modern humans (Homo sapiens) and their predecessors are believed to have lived. In September 2019, scientists reported the computerized determination, based on 260 CT scans, of a virtual skull shape of the last common human ancestor to modern humans, representative of the earliest modern humans, and suggested that modern humans arose between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago through a merging of populations in East and South Africa. &quot;Homo naledi&quot; likely coexisted with modern humans in Africa about 300,000 years ago.

===Kingdom of Mapungubwe===

The Kingdom of Mapungubwe (c. 1075–c. 1220) was one of the earliest state in the South African region. It was located at between the Shashe and Limpopo Rivers. The name is derived from either Karanga and Tshivenda. The kingdom is thought to have existed as the first class-based social system within the region. Society was mainly centered around family and farming. The kingdom would culminate to the Kingdom of Zimbabwe in the 13th century. And at its height the capital&#x27;s population was about 5000 people. There are no written records from the kingdom and what historians and archeologists know of the state is from the remains of buildings.

===Kingdom of Zimbabwe and successor states===
The Kingdom of Zimbabwe (c. 1220–1450) was a Shona (Karanga) kingdom in what is today Zimbabwe. The capital, which sits near present-day Masvingo, is located at Great Zimbabwe, which are the largest stone structure in precolonial Southern Africa. This kingdom came after the collapse of the Kingdom of Mapungubwe. During the decline of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe, two powers emerged, one in the north (Kingdom of Mutapa from 1430–1760) which had improved on Zimbabwe&#x27;s administrative structure; and the other in the south (Kingdom of Butua from 1450–1683) which was a smaller entity than the former two, the kingdom was governed by the Torwa dynasty and its capital was situated at Khami. Both states would eventually be absorbed by the powerful Shona state, the Rozwi Empire by 1683. The economy was based on cattle herding, farming, and gold mining. The empire lasted until 1866, which came after droughts and instability.

===Mthethwa Paramountcy===
The Mthethwa Paramountcy was an African state that emerged in the late 18th-century in the region of present-day KwaZulu-Natal. The state was consolidated and extended under the rule of Dingiswayo who produced a disciplined and highly organised army for the first time in the region.

===Zulu Kingdom===

The Zulu Kingdom rose under the leadership of Shaka and covered most of present-day KwaZulu-Natal in the 19th century. Internal conflict arose in the 1820s between Shaka&#x27;s half-brothers Dingane and Mhlangana due to a succession dispute. Boer settlers began arriving northwards of the Orange River in the 1830s, which led to conflicts between the two peoples and resulted in the Battle of Blood River in 1838. The kingdom fell during the Anglo-Zulu War of the late 19th-century.

===Post-colonial eras===

In the aftermath of World War II, the colonial powers came under international pressure to decolonize. The transfer to an African majority, however, was complicated by the settlement of white peoples. After an initial phase from 1945 to 1958, as a consolidation of white power, decolonization succeeded in its achievement when High Commission territories and overseas departments such as Zambia, Malawi, Botswana, Lesotho, Mauritius, Swaziland, Madagascar and the Comoros became independent states from British and French rule. The brutal struggle for independence in the colonial territories led to the independence of new states of Angola and Mozambique as well as Southern Rhodesia, which declared independence as Zimbabwe in 1980. The denouement of South West Africa achieved independence as Namibia in 1990 and the black majority in South Africa took power after the democratic elections in 1994, therefore ending the Apartheid regime. From the end of the period of colonial rule, imperial interests controlled the economies of the region and South Africa became 
the dominant economic power in the late 20th century. The 21st century has seen attempts to create unity among nations in Southern Africa. In spite of democracy, violence, inequality and poverty still persist throughout the region.

==Economy==

The region is distinct from the rest of Africa, with a robust mining sector and comparatively developed secondary and tertiary sectors. Additionally many countries (with the exception of Mozambique and Malawi in particular) have relatively well developed infrastructure. Some of its main exports including platinum, diamonds, gold, copper, cobalt, chromium and uranium, Southern Africa still faces some of the problems that the rest of the continent does. Despite this, diamond production has fueled the economies of Botswana and Namibia, for example.

Over the 20th century, the region developed a robust manufacturing sector, focused on South Africa and Zimbabwe, which allowed greater prosperity and investments into infrastructure, education and healthcare that elevated both nations into middle income economies and captured growing markets across Africa. However, since the 1990s these industries have struggled in the face of globalization and cheaper imports from China, leading to job losses particularly in heavy industry, gold mining and textiles. Zimbabwe in particular has seen significant deindustrialization as a result of factors both domestic and foreign. While colonialism has left its mark on the development over the course of history, today poverty, corruption, and HIV/AIDS are some of the biggest factors impeding economic growth. In addition, South Africa and Zimbabwe in particular, face high emigration among their skilled workers leading to a significant brain drain to western economies and billions lost in human capital flight. The pursuit of economic and political stability is an important part of the region&#x27;s goals, as demonstrated by the SADC, however complete regional integration remains an elusive target.

In terms of economic strength, South Africa is the dominant economy of the region. Generally, mining, agriculture, the public sector and tourism dominate the economies of Southern African countries, apart from South Africa which has mature and flourishing financial, retail, and construction sectors. Zimbabwe maintains a smaller banking and real estate sector along with what remains of its manufacturing industry, despite a protracted economic crisis. Most global banks have their regional offices for Southern Africa based in Johannesburg. Over the years, some the other Southern African nations have invested in economic diversification, and invested public funds into rail, road and air transportation as part of a concerted effort through SADC to boost regional trade and improve communication and transportation. The countries in this region also belong to the Southern Africa Power Pool, which facilitates the development of a competitive electricity market within the SADC region and ensures sustainable energy developments through sound economic, environmental and social practices. The main objective of the power pool is to develop a world class, robust and safe interconnected electrical system across the Southern African Region. According to a report by Southern Africa Power Pool, the three largest producers of electricity in Southern Africa as at 2017, include Eskom in South Africa with an estimated 46,963MW, Zesco in Zambia with 2,877MW and SNL of Angola with 2,442MW. Whilst moderately successful by African standards, the region largely lags behind their Asian counterparts in innovation, foreign direct investment, STEM sciences and research and development.

==Crime==
Several countries in the region, especially South Africa and Leshoto, struggle with very high crime rates. South Africa&#x27;s homicide rate has consistently ranked among the highest in the world during the past decades. South Africa has four cities (Nelson Mandela Bay, Durban, Cape Town and Johannesburg) included in the top 50 most dangerous cities (defined as cities with a population over 300,000 with the highest homicide rates, as reported by The Citizen Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice, a Mexican advocacy group, in its 2023/2024 ranking). High homicide rates are also present in Lesotho, Eswatini, Namibia and Botswana.

==Environment==

Southern Africa has a wide diversity of ecoregions including grassland, bushveld, karoo, savannah and riparian zones. Even though considerable disturbance has occurred in some regions from habitat loss due to human population density or export-focused development, there remain significant numbers of various wildlife species, including white rhino, lion, African leopard, impala, kudu, blue wildebeest, vervet monkey and elephant. It has complex Plateaus that create massive mountain structures along the South African border.

There are numerous environmental issues in Southern Africa, including air pollution and desertification.

==Demographics and languages==
Southern Africa is home to many people. It was initially populated by San, Hottentots and Pygmies in widely dispersed concentrations. Due to the Bantu expansion, the majority of African ethnic groups in this region, including the Xhosa, Zulu, Tsonga, Swazi, Northern Ndebele, Southern Ndebele, Tswana, Sotho, Pedi, Mbundu, Ovimbundu, Shona, Chaga and Sukuma, speak Bantu languages. The process of colonization and settling resulted in a small population of European (Afrikaner, British, Portuguese Africans, etc.) and Asian descent (Cape Malays, Indian South Africans, etc.) people in many southern African countries.

Christianity is by far the most common religion in the region, being the religion of the majority of the population in all countries of Southern Africa (see Christianity in Africa). There are also sizeable Muslim communities in Mozambique and Malawi, and smaller communities in the other countries of the region. There is also a small Hindu community in South Africa. In addition, traditional African religions are also practiced.

==Agriculture and food security==

Some key factors affecting the food security within the regions including political instability, poor governance, droughts, population growth, urbanisation, poverty, low economic growth, inadequate agricultural policies, trade terms and regimes, resource degradation and the recent increase in HIV/AIDS.

These factors vary from country to country. For example, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has favourable climatic and physical conditions, but performs far below its capacity in food provision due to political instability and poor governance. In contrast, semi-arid countries such as Botswana and Namibia, produce insufficient food, but successfully achieve food security through food imports due to economic growth, political stability and good governance. The Republic of South Africa is a major food producer and exporter in the region.

Data on agricultural production trends and food insecurity especially in term of food availability for Southern Africa is readily available through the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) and Southern African Development Community (SADC) - Food, Agriculture and Nature Resource Directorate (FARN). However, this data might not fully capture the reality of a region with large urban populations and where food insecurity goes beyond per-capita availability to issues of access and dietary adequacy.

Urban food security has been noted as an emerging area of concern in the region, with recent data showing high levels of food insecurity amongst low-income households. In a study of eleven cities in nine countries: Blantyre, Cape Town, Gaborone, Harare, Johannesburg, Lusaka, Maputo, Manzini, Maseru, Durban, and Windhoek, only 17% of households were categorized as &#x27;food-secure&#x27; while more than half (57%) of all households surveyed were found to be &#x27;severely food-insecure&#x27;.

Some factors affecting urban food insecurity include climate change with potential impact on agricultural productivity, the expansion of supermarkets in the region, which is changing the way people obtain food in the city, rural-to-urban migration, unemployment, and poverty. The issue of food insecurity in general and urban food insecurity in particular in the region is also characterized by an increased consumption of caloric junk food and processed foods leading to potential increase in the co-existence of undernutrition and dietary-related chronic diseases such as obesity and hypertension. In South Africa for example, while over 50% experience hunger, 61% are overweight or morbidly obese. There is only limited data on the other Southern African countries.

From 2018 to 2021, parts of the region suffered from a period of drought.

<text>was a town located in Naoiri District, Ōita Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 4,686 and the density of 32.84 persons per km2. The total area was 142.69 km2.

On April 1, 2005, Kujū, along with the towns of Naoiri and Ogi (all from Naoiri District), was merged into the expanded city of Taketa.

In addition to being a tourist destination, beef, strawberries, rice and mushrooms are produced locally by small scale farmers. Mount Kujū is a popular local destination for hiking and in the spring, there are abundant pink flowering shrubs (&quot;miayama kirishima&quot;.) Hikers may use the Bogatsuru (坊がつる) campsite free of charge. The surrounding areas have many onsen or natural hot springs. Kujū also has a flower park, which sells lavender ice cream.

Many of the families in Kujū still live a traditional Japanese lifestyle, with extended families living together, houses with real shoji - rice paper sliding doors and tatami mats, and people eating rice, fish and miso soup for breakfast. Kujū is also home to TAO, one of Japan&#x27;s foremost taiko groups, and Kudami Taiko, an all women taiko group.

<text>Willem de Kooning ( , ; April 24, 1904 – March 19, 1997) was a Dutch-American abstract expressionist artist. Born in Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, he moved to the United States in 1926, becoming a US citizen in 1962. In 1943, he married painter Elaine Fried.

In the years after World War II, De Kooning painted in a style that came to be referred to as abstract expressionism or &quot;action painting&quot;, and was part of a group of artists that came to be known as the New York School. Other painters in this group included Jackson Pollock, Elaine de Kooning, Lee Krasner, Franz Kline, Arshile Gorky, Mark Rothko, Hans Hofmann, John Ferren, Nell Blaine, Adolph Gottlieb, Anne Ryan, Robert Motherwell, Philip Guston, Clyfford Still, and Richard Pousette-Dart. De Kooning&#x27;s retrospective held at MoMA in 2011–2012 made him one of the best-known artists of the 20th century.

==Biography==
Willem de Kooning was born in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on April 24, 1904. His parents, Leendert de Kooning and Cornelia Nobel, were divorced in 1907, and De Kooning lived first with his father and then with his mother. He left school in 1916 and became an apprentice in a firm of commercial artists. Until 1924 he attended evening classes in Rotterdam at the (Academy of Fine Arts and Applied Sciences), now the Willem de Kooning Academie.
In 1926, De Kooning traveled to the United States as a stowaway on the &quot;Shelley&quot;, a British freighter bound for Argentina, and on August 15 landed at Newport News, Virginia. He intended to become an illustrator of pulp magazines; he recalled in 1969 that &quot;those American illustrators were the most inspiring artists to me!&quot; He stayed at the Dutch Seamen&#x27;s Home in Hoboken, New Jersey, and found work as a house painter. In 1927, he moved to Manhattan, where he had a studio on West Forty-fourth Street. He supported himself with jobs in carpentry, house painting and commercial art.

De Kooning began painting in his free time, and in 1928 he joined the art colony at Woodstock, New York. He also began to meet some of the modernist artists active in Manhattan. Among them were the American Stuart Davis, the Armenian Arshile Gorky and the Russian John Graham, whom De Kooning collectively called the &quot;Three Musketeers&quot;. Gorky, whom De Kooning first met at the home of Misha Reznikoff, became a close friend and, for at least ten years, an important influence. Balcomb Greene said that &quot;de Kooning virtually worshipped Gorky&quot;; according to Aristodimos Kaldis, &quot;Gorky was de Kooning&#x27;s master&quot;. De Kooning&#x27;s drawing &quot;Self-portrait with Imaginary Brother&quot;, from about 1938, may show him with Gorky; the pose of the figures is that of a photograph of Gorky with Peter Busa in about 1936.

De Kooning joined the Artists Union in 1934, and in 1935 was employed in the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration, for which he designed a number of murals including some for the Williamsburg Federal Housing Project in Brooklyn. None of them were executed, but a sketch for one was included in &quot;New Horizons in American Art&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art, his first group show. Starting in 1937, when De Kooning had to leave the Federal Art Project because he did not have American citizenship, he began to work full-time as an artist, earning income from commissions and by giving lessons. That year De Kooning was assigned to a portion of the mural &quot;Medicine&quot; for the &quot;Hall of Pharmacy&quot; at the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair in New York, which drew the attention of critics, the images themselves so completely new and distinct from the era of American realism.

De Kooning met his wife, Elaine Fried, at the American Artists School in New York. She was 14 years his junior. Thus was to begin a lifelong partnership affected by alcoholism, lack of money, love affairs, quarrels and separations. They were married on December 9, 1943. De Kooning worked on his first series of portrait paintings: standing or sedentary men like &quot;Two Men Standing&quot;, &quot;Man&quot;, and &quot;Seated Figure (Classic Male)&quot;, even combining with self-portraits as with &quot;Portrait with Imaginary Brother&quot; (1938–39). At this time, De Kooning&#x27;s work borrowed strongly from Gorky&#x27;s surrealist imagery and was influenced by Picasso. This changed only when De Kooning met the younger painter Franz Kline, who was also working with the figurative style of American realism and had been drawn to monochrome. Kline, who died young, was one of De Kooning&#x27;s closest artist friends. Kline&#x27;s influence is evident in De Kooning&#x27;s calligraphic &quot;black images&quot; of this period.

During the late 1940s and early &#x27;50s, De Kooning joined other fellow contemporary artists including Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline, in their struggle to break free from common artistic movements of the era including Cubism, Surrealism and Regionalism. Their emotive gestures and abstract pieces were a result of their attempt to abandon the other movements. This movement was later called &quot;Abstract Expressionism&quot; sometimes known as &quot;Action Painting&quot; and the &quot;New York School&quot;.

Between 1948 and 1953, De Kooning became more well known for his artistic techniques but he tried not to repeat himself.

In the late 1950s, De Kooning&#x27;s work shifted away from the figurative work of the women (though he would return to that subject matter on occasion) and began to display an interest in more abstract, less representational imagery. He became a US citizen on March 13, 1962, and in the following year moved from Broadway to a small house in East Hampton, a house that Elaine&#x27;s brother Peter Fried had sold to him two years before. He built a studio near by, and lived in the house to the end of his life.

It was revealed that, toward the end of his life, De Kooning had begun to lose his memory in the late 1980s and had been suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease for some time. This revelation has initiated considerable debate among scholars and critics about how responsible De Kooning was for the creation of his late work.

Succumbing to the progression of his disease, De Kooning painted his final works in 1991. He died in 1997 at the age of 92 and was cremated.

==Marriage to Elaine de Kooning==

Elaine had admired Willem&#x27;s artwork before meeting him; in 1938 her teacher introduced her to De Kooning at a Manhattan cafeteria when she was 20 and he 34. After meeting, he began to instruct her in drawing and painting. They painted in Willem&#x27;s loft at 143 West 21st Street, and he was known for his harsh criticism of her work, &quot;sternly requiring that she draw and redraw a figure or still life and insisting on fine, accurate, clear linear definition supported by precisely modulated shading.&quot; He even destroyed many of her drawings, but this &quot;impelled Elaine to strive for both precision and grace in her work&quot;. When they married in 1943, she moved into his loft and they continued sharing studio spaces.

Elaine and Willem de Kooning had what was later called an open marriage; they both were casual about sex and about each other&#x27;s affairs. Elaine had affairs with men who helped further Willem&#x27;s career, such as Harold Rosenberg, who was a renowned art critic, Thomas B. Hess, who was a writer about art and managing editor for &quot;ARTnews&quot;, and Charles Egan, owner of the Charles Egan Gallery.

Willem had a daughter, Lisa de Kooning, in 1956, as a result of his affair with Joan Ward. He also had a romance with Ruth Kligman after her affair with Jackson Pollock ended with his death in a car crash in 1956.

Elaine and Willem both struggled with alcoholism, which eventually led to their separation in 1957. While separated, Elaine remained in New York, struggling with poverty, and Willem moved to Long Island and dealt with depression. Despite bouts with alcoholism, they both continued painting. Although separated for nearly twenty years, they never divorced, and ultimately reunited in 1976.

==Work==

===Early work===

De Kooning&#x27;s paintings of the 1930s and early 1940s are abstract still-lifes characterised by geometric or biomorphic shapes and strong colours. They show the influence of his friends Davis, Gorky and Graham, but also of Arp, Joan Miró, Mondrian and Pablo Picasso. In the same years, De Kooning also painted a series of solitary male figures, either standing or seated, against undefined backgrounds; many of these are unfinished.

===Black-and-white abstracts===
By 1946, De Kooning had begun a series of black-and-white paintings, which he would continue into 1949. During this period he had his first one-man show at the Charles Egan Gallery in 1948 consisting largely of black-and-white works, although a few pieces have passages of bright color. De Kooning&#x27;s black paintings are important to the history of abstract expressionism owing to their densely impacted forms, their mixed media, and their technique.
===The &quot;Woman&quot; series===
De Kooning painted women regularly in the early and late 1940s, but it was not until 1950 that he began to explore the female subject exclusively. His well-known &quot;Woman&quot; series, begun in 1950 and culminating in &quot;Woman VI&quot;, owes much to Picasso, not least in the aggressive, penetrative breaking apart of the figure, and the spaces around it. Picasso&#x27;s late works show signs that he, in turn, saw images of works by Pollock and De Kooning.
De Kooning led the 1950s art world into a new movement known as American abstract expressionism. &quot;From 1940 to the present, Woman has manifested herself in De Kooning&#x27;s paintings and drawings as at once the focus of desire, frustration, inner conflict, pleasure, … and as posing problems of conception and handling as demanding as those of an engineer.&quot; The female figure is an important symbol for De Kooning&#x27;s art career and his own life. The &quot;Woman&quot; painting is considered as a significant work of art for the museum through its historical context about the post-World War II history and American feminist movement. Additionally, the medium (oil, enamel, and charcoal on canvas) of this painting makes it different from others of De Kooning&#x27;s time.

=== Notable works ===
The painter is noted for his paintings: &quot;Woman III&quot; (1953), &quot;Woman VI&quot; (1953), &quot;Interchange&quot; (1955), and &quot;Police Gazette&quot; (1955). Some notable sculptures are &quot;Clamdigger&quot; (1972/1976) and &quot;Seated Woman on a Bench&quot; (1972/1976).

==Market reception==
Some of De Kooning&#x27;s paintings have been sold in the 21st century for record prices. In November 2006, the American business magnate David Geffen sold his oil painting &quot;Woman III&quot; to hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen for $137.5 million, just below the record at the time of $140 million, which involved the same people in the same month for Jackson Pollock&#x27;s &quot;No. 5, 1948&quot;. A month earlier Cohen had already paid Geffen $63.5 million for &quot;Police Gazette&quot; by De Kooning. In September 2015, Geffen sold De Kooning&#x27;s oil painting &quot;Interchange&quot; to hedge-fund billionaire Ken Griffin for ca. $300 million, the highest price paid for a painting at the time. It held the record until November 15, 2017, when the da Vinci &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot; sold for $450 million at Christie&#x27;s in New York. In November 2016, &quot;Untitled XXV&quot; sold for $66.3 million at Christie&#x27;s in New York. This was a record price for a De Kooning piece sold at public auction.

According to Patricia Failing:
:By the end of the 1950s, in the opinion of many, the most influential painter at work for the world was the abstract expressionist master William de Kooning. Although it was 1948 before he was given his first one man show, De Kooning had previously acquired a formidable underground reputation which served to boost him to prominence, along with Jackson Pollock, as a leading exponent of &quot;action painting.&quot;

==Solo exhibitions==

The artist was featured in a number of solo exhibitions from 1948 to 1966, many in New York but also nationally and internationally. Specifically, he had 14 separate exhibitions, with two exhibitions per annum in the years 1953, 1964, and 1965. He was featured at the Egan Gallery, the Sidney Janis Gallery, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Arts Club of Chicago, the Martha Jackson Gallery, the Workshop Center, the Paul Kantor Gallery, the Hames Goodman Gallery, the Allan Stone Gallery, and the Smith College Museum of Art. Most of the exhibitions lasted for three weeks to one month. Most recent exhibition, &quot;De Kooning: Five Decades&quot;, took place in the Mnuchin Gallery, New York City, from April 19 till June 15, 2019.

In terms of its composition, MgB2 differs strikingly from most low-temperature superconductors, which feature mainly transition metals. Its superconducting mechanism is primarily described by BCS theory.

==Superconductivity==
Magnesium diboride&#x27;s superconducting properties were discovered in 2001. Its critical temperature (&quot;T&quot;c) of is the highest amongst conventional superconductors. Among conventional (phonon-mediated) superconductors, it is unusual. Its electronic structure is such that there exist two types of electrons at the Fermi level with widely differing behaviours, one of them (sigma-bonding) being much more strongly superconducting than the other (pi-bonding). This is at odds with usual theories of phonon-mediated superconductivity which assume that all electrons behave in the same manner. Theoretical understanding of the properties of MgB2 has nearly been achieved by modelling two energy gaps. In 2001 it was regarded as behaving more like a metallic than a cuprate superconductor.

===Semi-Meissner state===
Using BCS theory and the known energy gaps of the pi and sigma bands of electrons (2.2 and 7.1 meV, respectively), the pi and sigma bands of electrons have been found to have two different coherence lengths (51 nm and 13 nm, respectively). The corresponding London penetration depths are 33.6 nm and 47.8 nm. This implies that the Ginzburg-Landau parameters are 0.66±0.02 and 3.68, respectively. The first is less than 1/ and the second is greater, therefore the first seems to indicate marginal type I superconductivity and the second type II superconductivity.

It has been predicted that when two different bands of electrons yield two quasiparticles, one of which has a coherence length that would indicate type I superconductivity and one of which would indicate type II, then in certain cases, vortices attract at long distances and repel at short distances. In particular, the potential energy between vortices is minimized at a critical distance. As a consequence there is a conjectured new phase called the semi-Meissner state, in which vortices are separated by the critical distance. When the applied flux is too small for the entire superconductor to be filled with a lattice of vortices separated by the critical distance, then there are large regions of type I superconductivity, a Meissner state, separating these domains.

Experimental confirmation for this conjecture has arrived recently in MgB2 experiments at 4.2 Kelvin. The authors found that there are indeed regimes with a much greater density of vortices. Whereas the typical variation in the spacing between Abrikosov vortices in a type II superconductor is of order 1%, they found a variation of order 50%, in line with the idea that vortices assemble into domains where they may be separated by the critical distance. The term type-1.5 superconductivity was coined for this state.

==Synthesis==
Magnesium diboride was synthesized and its structure confirmed in 1953. The simplest synthesis involves high temperature reaction between boron and magnesium powders. Formation begins at 650 °C; however, since magnesium metal melts at 652 °C, the reaction may involve diffusion of magnesium vapor across boron grain boundaries. At conventional reaction temperatures, sintering is minimal, although grain recrystallization is sufficient for Josephson quantum tunnelling between grains.

Superconducting magnesium diboride wire can be produced through the powder-in-tube (PIT) &quot;ex situ&quot; and &quot;in situ&quot; processes. In the &quot;in situ&quot; variant, a mixture of boron and magnesium is reduced in diameter by conventional wire drawing. The wire is then heated to the reaction temperature to form MgB2. In the &quot;ex situ&quot; variant, the tube is filled with MgB2 powder, reduced in diameter, and sintered at 800 to 1000 °C. In both cases, later hot isostatic pressing at approximately 950 °C further improves the properties.

An alternative technique, disclosed in 2003, employs reactive liquid infiltration of magnesium inside a granular preform of boron powders and was called Mg-RLI technique. The method allowed the manufacture of both high density (more than 90% of the theoretical density for MgB2) bulk materials and special hollow fibers. This method is equivalent to similar melt growth based methods such as the Infiltration and Growth Processing method used to fabricate bulk YBCO superconductors where the non-superconducting Y2BaCuO5 is used as granular preform inside which YBCO based liquid phases are infiltrated to make superconductive YBCO bulk. This method has been copied and adapted for MgB2 and rebranded as Reactive Mg Liquid Infiltration. The process of Reactive Mg Liquid Infiltration in a boron preform to obtain MgB2 has been a subject of patent applications by the Italian company Edison S.p.A.

Hybrid physical–chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD) has been the most effective technique for depositing magnesium diboride (MgB2) thin films. The surfaces of MgB2 films deposited by other technologies are usually rough and non-stoichiometric. In contrast, the HPCVD system can grow high-quality &quot;in situ&quot; pure MgB2 films with smooth surfaces, which are required to make reproducible uniform Josephson junctions, the fundamental element of superconducting circuits.

==Electromagnetic properties==
Properties depend greatly on composition and fabrication process. Many properties are anisotropic due to the layered structure. &#x27;Dirty&#x27; samples, e.g., with oxides at the crystal boundaries, are different from &#x27;clean&#x27; samples.

*The highest superconducting transition temperature &quot;T&quot;c is 39 K.
*MgB2 is a type-II superconductor, i.e. increasing magnetic field gradually penetrates into it.
*Maximum critical current (&quot;J&quot;c) is: 105 A/m2 at 20 T, 106 A/m2 at 18 T, 107 A/m2 at 15 T, 108 A/m2 at 10 T, 109 A/m2 at 5 T.
*As of 2008 : Upper critical field (Hc2): (parallel to &quot;ab&quot; planes) is ~14 T, (perpendicular to &quot;ab&quot; planes) ~3 T, in thin films up to 74 T, in fibers up to 55 T.

===Improvement by doping===
Various means of doping MgB2 with carbon (e.g. using 10% malic acid) can improve the upper critical field and the maximum current density
(also with polyvinyl acetate).

5% doping with carbon can raise Hc2 from 16 to 36 T while lowering &quot;T&quot;c only from 39 K to 34 K. The maximum critical current (&quot;J&quot;c) is reduced, but doping with TiB2 can reduce the decrease. (Doping MgB2 with Ti is patented.)

The maximum critical current (&quot;J&quot;c) in magnetic field is enhanced greatly (approx double at 4.2 K) by doping with ZrB2.

Even small amounts of doping lead both bands into the type II regime and so no semi-Meissner state may be expected.

==Thermal conductivity==
MgB2 is a multi-band superconductor, that is each Fermi surface has different superconducting energy gap. For MgB2, sigma bond of boron is strong, and it induces large s-wave superconducting gap, and pi bond is weak and induces small s-wave gap. 
The quasiparticle states of the vortices of large gap are highly confined to the vortex core.
On the other hand, the quasiparticle states of small gap are loosely bound to the vortex core. Thus they can be delocalized and overlap easily between adjacent vortices. Such delocalization can strongly contribute to the thermal conductivity, which shows abrupt increase above Hc1.

==Possible applications==

===Superconductors===
Superconducting properties and low cost make magnesium diboride attractive for a variety of applications. For those applications, MgB2 powder is compressed with silver metal (or 316 stainless steel) into wire and sometimes tape via the Powder-in-tube process.
In 2006 a 0.5 tesla open MRI superconducting magnet system was built using 18 km of MgB2 wires. This MRI used a closed-loop cryocooler, without requiring externally supplied cryogenic liquids for cooling.

&quot;...the next generation MRI instruments must be made of MgB2 coils instead of NbTi coils, operating in the 20–25 K range without liquid helium for cooling. ...
Besides the magnet applications MgB2 conductors have potential uses in superconducting transformers, rotors and transmission cables at temperatures of around 25 K, at fields of 1 T.&quot;

A project at CERN to make MgB2 cables has resulted in superconducting test cables able to carry 20,000 amperes for extremely high current distribution applications, such as the high luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider.

The IGNITOR tokamak design was based on MgB2 for its poloidal coils.

Thin coatings can be used in superconducting radio frequency cavities to minimize energy loss and reduce the inefficiency of liquid helium cooled niobium cavities.

Because of the low cost of its constituent elements, MgB2 has promise for use in superconducting low to medium field magnets, electric motors and generators, fault current limiters and current leads.

===Propellants, explosives, pyrotechnics===

Unlike elemental boron whose combustion is incomplete through the glassy oxide layered impeding oxygen diffusion, magnesium diboride burns completely when ignited in oxygen or in mixtures with oxidizers. Thus magnesium boride has been proposed as fuel in ram jets. In addition the use of MgB2 in blast-enhanced explosives and propellants has been proposed for the same reasons. Decoy flares containing magnesium diboride/Teflon/Viton display 30–60% increased spectral efficiency, Eλ (J g−1sr−1), compared to classical Magnesium/Teflon/Viton(MTV) payloads.
An application of magnesium diboride to hybrid rocket propulsion has also been investigated, mixing the compound in paraffin wax fuel grains to improve mechanical properties and combustion characteristics.

<text>Blasco Núñez Vela (c. 1490 – January 18, 1546) was the first Spanish viceroy of South America (&quot;Viceroyalty of Peru&quot;). Serving from May 15, 1544 to January 18, 1546, he was charged by Charles V with the enforcement of the controversial New Laws, which dealt with the failure of the encomienda system to protect the indigenous people of America from the rapacity of the conquistadors and their descendants.

==Origins==
Núñez Vela was a native of Ávila, born into an ancient and noble family. The Núñez Vela family, lords of Tabadillo, lived in this area from at least 1403. He was a descendant of Don Pedro Nuñez de la Fuente Almexir (Fuentearmegil) the loyal, who saved the life of the King of Castile, Alfonso VIII in 1163. He was a knight of the Order of Santiago and &quot;corregidor&quot; of Málaga and Cuenca, Spain, and devoted to the service of the king. One of his brothers was lord of the bedchamber to the king, and another was archbishop of Burgos. Although honest, loyal and courageous, Núñez was also very hot headed.

==Appointment as viceroy==
In 1543 he was named viceroy, governor and captain general of Peru and president of the Audiencia, and also captain general of Chile, with a salary of 5,000 ducats.

He sailed from Sanlucar on November 3, 1542 in command of a fleet, with much pomp, and arrived in Lima on May 17, 1544. He was accompanied by the members of the Audiencia and other illustrious personalities. His last instructions from the king were to &quot;show himself to be a severe punisher of infractions.&quot; Núñez&#x27;s adherence to these instructions was to prove very costly.

==The New Laws==
The New Laws promulgated by Charles, under the influence of reformers such as Bartolomé de las Casas, had been established to improve the lot of the indigenous peoples of the Americas within the Spanish dominions. They were intended to clarify, expand and enforce provisions of the Laws of Burgos of 1512. The latter had provided many safeguards for the indigenous population, but these had not been strictly enforced. The New Laws became effective November 20, 1542.

In order to enforce the New Laws and suppress the insubordination of the conquistadors in New Spain and Peru, representatives of the Crown were provided with the powers and authority of the king. The new office was designated a viceroyalty at the head of which was a viceroy or &quot;virrey&quot;. Audiencias were also appointed to assist the viceroys in the administration of civil and criminal justice. The Audiencias were composed of four &quot;oidores&quot; (judges).

==Actions as viceroy==
Núñez arrived at Nombre de Dios on January 10, 1544, and passed from there to Panama City. Leaving the Audiencia in Panama, he sailed for Peru, arriving at Tumbes on March 14, 1544. He went from there to Trujillo, where he was solemnly received, and thence to La Barranca. In La Barranca he may have read on one of the walls, &quot;Whoever comes to take my hacienda, his life will be taken&quot;.

The New Laws were not well received by the conquistadors because they provided that what was effectively Indian slavery had to end, that everyone had to pay a fair share of taxes, and that all the encomienda rights had to go to the king. The conquistadors would have none of this.

Núñez arrived in Lima, the capital of the colony, on May 17, 1544, where he was received in royal splendor and sworn into office. News of governmental measures he had already taken on the voyage had preceded him, and he was met with hostility and resistance from the officials and clergy. Núñez himself now had doubts about enforcing the New Laws in the current situation. He agreed to join the Spanish landowners in the colony in a petition to the emperor to suspend them, but claiming a lack of authority, he refused to suspend them on his own initiative.

The resistance aggravated his distrust and increased the severity of his measures. He imprisoned Cristóbal Vaca de Castro, his predecessor as head of the colonial government, and then had him sent to Spain. On September 13, 1544, in a late night interview in the viceroy&#x27;s palace, Núñez accused Juan Suárez de Carbajal of treason. The exchange became heated, and Núñez killed Suárez with a dagger.

==Deposition as viceroy==
The death of Suárez led the Audiencia to break with the viceroy. Believing they could rely on help from Gonzalo Pizarro, brother of Francisco Pizarro, they determined to remove Núñez from office and send him back to Spain. (Pizarro had already raised a small army in opposition to the viceroy.) On September 18, 1544 they deposed him and ordered his imprisonment. The viceroy was sent a prisoner to the island of San Lorenzo, to be handed over to oidor Álvarez. In Álvarez&#x27;s custody, Núñez left San Lorenzo for Panama on September 24. Just out of port, Álvarez told the viceroy he was now free, and turned over command of the ship to him.

==The civil war==
Núñez ordered the ship to sail for Tumbes, where he disembarked in the middle of October. He gathered an army and led it south to battle the conquistadors. Pizarro made his solemn entry into Lima on October 28, at the head of 1,200 well-trained and well-armed soldiers, with artillery, under the royal banner of Castile. Both sides claimed to be defenders of the king. Pizarro was sworn in before the Audiencia as interim governor and captain general of Peru, until a replacement could be named by the king.

Núñez and his small force left San Miguel (near Quito) just ahead of Pizarro&#x27;s soldiers. The hope was to link up in the high country with Benalcazar, the loyal commander at Popayan. Indecisive skirmishes were fought along the line of march. Núñez, suspecting treachery among his officers, had three of them executed. Núñez arrived in Popayan, and Pizarro occupied Quito, formerly friendly territory for the viceroy. Pizarro lured Núñez out of Popayan to Quito by a stratagem. The two armies met January 18, 1546 at nearby Añaquito.

Seven hundred soldiers of the army of Pizarro fought Núñez and his smaller army of a few hundred at Añaquito. Núñez fought bravely, in spite of his age, but he was killed in the battle and then decapitated. His head was marched about on a pike to demonstrate that the conquistadors had won and were now in charge. Fearing the loss of the American colonies the Crown watered down the New Laws and restored the encomiendas.

King Charles recognized the fallen viceroy and his sons, ordering that Núñez be honored annually. Charles made two of his sons knights, one in the Order of Santiago and one in the Order of Alcántara. The sons became ambassador to France, captain general of artillery, and archbishop of Burgos.

<doc id="459876" wikidata="Q1570937" url="?curid=459876" title="Prospect (magazine)">
<text>Prospect is a monthly British general-interest magazine, specialising in politics, economics and current affairs. Topics covered include British and other European, as well as US politics, social issues, art, literature, cinema, science, the media, history, philosophy and psychology. &quot;Prospect&quot; features a mixture of lengthy analytic articles, first-person reportage, one-page columns and shorter items.

== Background ==

The magazine was launched in October 1995 by David Goodhart, then a senior correspondent for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; (&quot;FT&quot;), and chairman Derek Coombs. Goodhart came up with the idea of producing an essay-based monthly general-interest magazine—a form unknown in Britain at that time—while covering German reunification as Bonn correspondent for the &quot;FT&quot;.

Some prominent intellectuals have featured in &quot;Prospect&quot;, including economists Joseph Stiglitz, Sen and Angus Deaton, writers such as Lionel Shriver, Clive James, Toni Morrison and Margaret Atwood, as well as scientists like Martin Rees. Notable features of the magazine include debates of two writers with opposing views, discussions among a series of experts with varying views, an edited transcript of which is published in the magazine, and interviews with political and cultural figures (examples include Orhan Pamuk, Paul Wolfowitz and Hilary Mantel).

&quot;Prospect&quot; received worldwide attention in October 2005 when it published its list of the world&#x27;s top 100 public intellectuals, which included Ziauddin Sardar, Noam Chomsky, Umberto Eco, Richard Dawkins, Steven Pinker and Christopher Hitchens. When the magazine asked readers to vote for the top intellectual on the list, Chomsky emerged the winner. Subsequent lists continued to get attention. Dawkins claimed the top spot in 2013. Amartya Sen won in 2014 and Thomas Piketty was the winner in 2015. After a four year absence, the award was revived by Caucher Birkar in 2019.

In 2011 &quot;Prospect&quot; published the winning short story of the Royal Society of Literature&#x27;s V. S. Pritchett Memorial Prize, Carys Davies&#x27; ‘&#x27;The Redemption of Galen Pike&#x27;’.

== Policy positions ==
The magazine features contributions from authors spanning the political spectrum. It tends to avoid a &quot;line&quot; on specific policy issues, claiming to offer a &quot;contrarian&quot; view and to be an &quot;open minded&quot; magazine. It has published articles debunking the &quot;popular wisdom&quot;, on topics ranging from Japan&#x27;s alleged economic crisis to the Mahdi army in Iraq. However, it has been described as left-leaning by the BBC, and the &quot;Prospect&quot; contributor Roger Scruton.

In an August 2009 roundtable interview in &quot;Prospect&quot;, Adair Turner supported the idea of new global taxes on financial transactions, warning that a &quot;swollen&quot; financial sector paying excessive salaries has grown too big for society. Turner&#x27;s suggestion that a &quot;Tobin tax&quot;, named after the economist James Tobin, should be considered for financial transactions drew international attention.

Since 2004, the magazine&#x27;s founding editor, David Goodhart, has stirred controversy with a series of articles arguing that the increasing diversity of the United Kingdom may weaken the bonds of solidarity on which the welfare state depends. The debate fed into the broader discussions of &quot;Britishness&quot;.

== Think Tank Awards ==
&quot;Prospect&quot; holds the annual Think Tank Awards, which celebrate and reward the works of think tanks on a national and global scale. The awards are supported by Shell. Categories include &quot;Global Think Tank of the Year&quot;, &quot;Publication of the Year&quot;, &quot;North American Think Tank of the Year&quot;, &quot;European Think Tank of the Year&quot; (excluding Britain), &#x27;UK Think Tank of the Year&#x27;, and many sub-categories just for the UK.

According to the official website, &quot;The awards are judged by a cross-party panel looking for evidence of influence on public policy and on the public discourse. The judges will also consider the quality of research and potential of younger and smaller organisations.&quot; The awards have been running since 2001, and have been expanding exponentially to include more global awards for international Think Tanks. The winner of the most recent 2017 Think Tank awards (held at the Institute of Directors on 10 July) was the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, based in the UK, for its &quot;very strong analytical appraisal of the social conditions in Britain&quot;.

<text>Posidippus of Pella ( &quot;Poseidippos&quot;; c. 310 – c. 240 BC) was an Ancient Greek epigrammatic poet.

==Life==
Posidippus was born in the city of Pella, capital of the kingdom of Macedon as the son of Admetos. He lived for some time in Samos before moving permanently to the court of Ptolemy I Soter and later Ptolemy II Philadelphus in Alexandria, Egypt. An inscription from Thermon in Aetolia records that he was honoured by the Aetolian League in about 264/3 BC. He was friends with the poets Asclepiades of Samos and Hedylus.

==Poetry==
Twenty-three of Posidippus&#x27; poems were included in the Greek Anthology, and several more were quoted in either part or whole by Athenaeus of Naucratis in his &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot;. Until 2001, based on these remains, it was assumed that Posidippus wrote only about drinking and love. In that year the &quot;Milan Papyrus&quot; P.Mil.Vogl. VIII 309 was recovered from the wrappings of an Egyptian mummy dating to about 180 BC. It contained 112 poems, two of which were previously known to have been written by Posidippus, which address subjects that include events of the court of the Ptolemaic dynasty, gemstones, and bird divination. Because of Posidippus&#x27; authorship of these two poems, scholars have concluded that the other poems of the &quot;Milan Papyrus&quot; were also written by him.

The poems of the &quot;Milan Papyrus&quot; are grouped into sections, and the papyrus largely preserves the section headers for the surviving poems:

# On Stones (&quot;Lithika&quot; [title restored from two partially preserved letters], poems 1-20)
# On Omens (&quot;Oionoskopika&quot;, 21-35)
# Dedications (&quot;Anathematika&quot;, 36-41)
# Epitaphs (&quot;Epitumbia&quot; [conjecture: title not preserved], 42-61)
# On Statues (&quot;Andriantopoiika&quot;, 62-70)
# On Equestrian Victories (&quot;Hippika&quot;, 71-88)
# On Shipwrecks (&quot;Nauagika&quot;, 89-94)
# On Cures (&quot;Iamatika&quot;, 95-101)
# Characters (&quot;Tropoi&quot;, 102-109)
# [title lost] (110-112)

<text>Gonzalo Pizarro y Alonso (; 1510 – 10 April 1548) was a Spanish conquistador. He was the younger paternal half brother of Francisco Pizarro, who led the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire. Pizarro was the illegitimate son of Gonzalo Pizarro y Rodríguez de Aguilar (1446–1522), who, as an infantry colonel, served under Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba during the Italian Wars. He was also the younger paternal half brother of Hernándo Pizarro y de Vargas and the older paternal full brother of Juan Pizarro y Alonso.

== Military career ==

=== Conquest of the Inca Empire ===
Born in Trujillo, Spain, Gonzalo Pizarro accompanied his eldest brother, Francisco Pizarro, in his third expedition for the conquest of Peru in 1530. Gonzalo was also the brother of Hernando Pizarro and Juan Pizarro. A lieutenant of his brother Francisco during the conquest, Gonzalo Pizarro was one of the most corrupt, brutal and ruthless conquistadors of the New World, being far less restrained towards the natives and the Inca than his older brothers.

After Inca emperor Atahualpa was captured in the Battle of Cajamarca and later executed, the Pizarro brothers and their followers marched towards the Inca capital of Cuzco to complete the conquest, capturing the city on 15 November 1533 after a brief battle with the Inca forces under Quizquiz holding it after previously defeating the central government and massacring the nobility of Cuzco. Gonzalo, and his brother Juan, were made regidores of the city on 24 March 1534.

Cusco was split into factions behind Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro, but these two signed a new article of agreement on 12 June 1535. Almagro then left Cuzco, having been given the honor by Spanish King Charles I of exploring the southern part of Peru (modern-day Chile)
Gonzalo and Juan Pizarro both looked after the settlements in Cuzco, while their eldest brother Francisco explored the west coast of northern Peru and founded the city of Lima in 1535. Gonzalo, Juan and his younger brother Hernándo ruled Cuzco as a dictatorship dominated by greed, corruption and brutality; torturing and executing those who refused to accept Spanish rule. Particularly egregious was the conduct of Juan and Gonzalo Pizarro towards the Inca Emperor, Manco Inca Yupanqui. Manco was angered by the conduct of the Spaniards towards Incan women, especially after Gonzalo raped his queen and sister-wife Cura Ocllo. According to Fernández de Oviedo, Hernando Pizarro, Juan Pizarro and Gonzalo Pizarro &quot;left no one single women or sister of his [Manco&#x27;s] unviolated&quot;, and had taken the Inca princesses as concubines. The Spaniards corrupt rule and disrespectful treatment towards Manco Inca Yupanqui led to large-scale rebellion.

The Incas fought the Spaniards in a number of sieges and battles for control of the land and temporarily captured Cuzco on May 6, 1536. The Incas were later defeated by the heavily armed Spanish soldiers led by Gonzalo and Juan. Smallpox was also spread among the natives and many perished.

When Almagro returned from Chile disappointed in not finding any gold, he captured and imprisoned Gonzalo and Hernándo on 8 April 1537. Gonzalo managed to escape and re-join Francisco Pizarro, while Almagro was on his way to Lima to negotiate with Francisco on who would control Cuzco. These negotiations led to Hernándo&#x27;s release. Hernando and Gonzalo then led an army against Almagro, defeating him in the Battle of Las Salinas. Almagro was captured, condemned for treason, and executed in Cusco on July 8, 1538.

==== Expeditions with Francisco de Orellana ====
In November 1539, Francisco Pizarro appointed Gonzalo vice-governor of Quito, which had been taken in 1534 by Sebastián de Benalcázar. Gonzalo was ordered to explore east of Quito to investigate the rumors of a rich native kingdom to the east, called El Dorado, and of the so-called Land of Cinnamon - &quot;País de la Canela&quot;. Gonzalo set about organising an expedition in Cusco; among those he recruited was Francisco de Orellana, a veteran of the conquest of the Inca and a dependable supporter of the Pizarro brothers. With 170 Spaniards and 3,000 Native Americans, Gonzalo marched to Quito in December 1540 and enlisted a further 220 Spaniards and 4,000 Native Americans. Orellana, Gonzalo&#x27;s second-in-command and relative, was sent to Guayaquil to gather more troops and horses. Gonzalo Pizarro and his followers left Quito on February 1541, a month before Orellana, who was able to bring 23 men and several horses. By March, the two met at the valley of Zumaco and started their march across the Andes. After following the courses of the Coca and Napo rivers, the expedition started to run out of provisions. About 140 of the 340 Spaniards and 3,000 out of 4,000 natives died. In February 1542, the leaders decided Orellana would take 50 men and continue sailing down the Napo river in search of food, then return to Pizarro. However, the return trip proved impossible because of adverse currents and Orellana&#x27;s own pursuit of discovery.

After a brief period, Gonzalo concluded the expedition was a complete failure and decided to take a northern route back to Quito with 80 of the remaining men, unknowingly relinquishing the success to Orellana, who ended up discovering and exploring the entire length of the Amazon River.

Upon his return to Quito, Gonzalo learned that the Almagristas (as the followers of Almagro were called) had assassinated his brother Francisco Pizarro on June 26, 1541 in retaliation for Almagro&#x27;s execution. By this time the Crown&#x27;s representative, Cristóbal Vaca de Castro, had arrived in Peru amidst the confusion after Pizarro&#x27;s death. Gonzalo offered to help capture those responsible for his brother&#x27;s death, but was refused. The Almagristas were finally defeated in the battle of Chupas on September 16, 1542, and their leader, Diego Almagro El Mozo, was executed.

=== Mutiny against the New Laws ===
Emperor Charles V then appointed Blasco Núñez Vela as Peru&#x27;s first viceroy in 1544. Núñez introduced the New Laws, which were framed by Bartolomé de las Casas to protect the indigenous peoples. Many of the conquistadors living in Peru were against these laws since they could no longer exploit the natives. This prompted Gonzalo Pizarro and Francisco de Carvajal to organize an army of followers with the intent of suppressing the New Laws. Many conquistadors turned against the Viceroy and joined Gonzalo&#x27;s side, as his surname provided an effective rallying point. The rebel army defeated Núñez in 1546 at Añaquito near Quito. Although some, such as Carvajal, advised Gonzalo to proclaim himself King of Peru and to disown any further claim by the King of Spain to the land, Gonzalo refused.

==== Execution by the Spanish army ====
Over the following months, however, the support for Gonzalo diminished when the King&#x27;s new representative, Pedro de la Gasca, arrived with the intention of offering pardon and repealing the New Laws. Most of Gonzalo&#x27;s army deserted him just before the crucial battle of Jaquijahuana near Cusco, that would determine the fate of the conquest. No longer supported by an army against the King&#x27;s new representative, Gonzalo Pizarro surrendered and was beheaded by the royal forces on the field of battle, being the last of the Pizarro brothers to die a violent death (with Hernando dying of old age in Spain some three or six decades later).

== In popular culture ==
Gonzalo Pizarro has been immortalised in several different projects over the years. In 1972 Werner Herzog wrote and directed the film Aguirre, the Wrath of God, a film that featured actor Klaus Kinski and Alejandro Repullés who played Gonzalo. The film reimagines two expeditions led by Gonzalo Pizarro, one in 1541, which resulted in the European discovery of the Amazon river by Francisco de Orellana, and another in which Pizarro and his men went in search of El Dorado. Aguirre, the Wrath of God received widespread critical acclaim and developed a cult following, it has appeared on Time magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;All Time 100 Best Films&quot;.

In 2011 NetEnt, a leading global supplier of online casino software and games released a video slot called Gonzo&#x27;s Quest for desktop and mobile browsers. A decade later in 2021 Evolution acquired the rights to the Gonzo&#x27;s Quest IP and released Gonzo&#x27;s Treasure Hunt Live a live casino game show game also playable on desktop and mobile browsers. Both titles feature a 3D animated version of Gonzalo Pizarro who interacts with the players throughout the duration of gameplay.

<doc id="459884" wikidata="Q1534580" url="?curid=459884" title="Gold Against the Soul">
<text>Gold Against the Soul is the second studio album by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers, released on 21 June 1993 by Columbia Records. The follow-up to the band&#x27;s 1992 debut album &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot;, the record reached No.8 on the UK Albums Chart.

&quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; takes to an extreme the hard rock sound of its predecessor and saw the band experiment with styles including funk and the then-contemporary grunge. The album&#x27;s lyrical themes owed little to the political and social commentaries of its predecessor, and instead explored more personal themes of depression, melancholy and nostalgia.

== Recording ==
The band stated that the choice to work with Dave Eringa again was important for this album: &quot;We finished work in November and then just went straight into a demo studio and we came out about four weeks later with the album all finished. We were all happy with all the songs, we knew what they wanted to sound like, so we didn&#x27;t want to use a mainstream producer because they&#x27;ve got their own sound and vision of what a record should be like. So we just phoned Dave up and said &#x27;Look, come down, let&#x27;s see how this works out&#x27;, and everyone loved what we were doing, so we decided to stay with him.&quot;

When asked to look back on the album, the band themselves have described &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; as their least favourite album and the period surrounding the album as being the most unfocused of their career. The band&#x27;s vocalist and guitarist James Dean Bradfield has said &quot;All we wanted to do was go under the corporate wing. We thought we could ignore it but you do get affected.&quot;

== Content ==
=== Lyrics, writing and themes ===
Simon Price of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; opined that the lyrics on &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; &quot;switched from the political [of &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot;] to the personal&quot;. The lyrical content is considerably less political than their previous album &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot;, and the album is more reflective of the despair and melancholy of their later work.

&quot;La Tristesse Durera&quot; (literally &quot;the sadness will go on&quot;) is the title of a biography of Vincent van Gogh, although the song is not about him but about a war veteran.

=== Style and influences ===
The album presents a different sound from their debut album, not only in terms of lyrics but in sound. The band privileged long guitar riffs and the drums feel more present and loud in the final mix of the album. This sound would be abandoned in their next album. According to AllMusic, the album takes &quot;the hard rock inclinations of &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; to an extreme.&quot; Meanwhile, Dave de Sylvia at Sputnikmusic characterized it as a glam rock album, similar to that of Bon Jovi, with Simon Price likening the record to &quot;a blend of Bon Jovi and Nirvana&quot;. Cam Lindsay of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; proclaimed it to be a &quot;sullen glam rock&quot; album. Writing &quot;Leyendas Urbanas del Rock&quot; in 2019, José Luis Martín proclaimed that &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; saw the Manics &quot;abandon glam punk and dangerously approach grunge&quot;. Tom Doyle of &quot;Q&quot; called the sound of the album &quot;epic pop-rock&quot;, while &quot;Gigwise&quot; described it as &quot;hair metal&quot;.

The album displayed a variety of styles; &quot;Roses in the Hospital&quot; tapped into a &quot;stadium funk-rock&quot; style, while &quot;From Despair to Where&quot; incorporated a quiet-loud dynamic; &quot;follow[ing] the grunge template&quot; in the words of Rob Jovanocic.

Regarding the album&#x27;s influences, bassist Nicky Wire remarked that &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; was &quot;all Alice in Chains and Red Hot Chili Peppers&quot;, and that he was emulating Flea at the time.

== Release ==
&quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; was released on 14 June 1993. It reached number 8 on the UK Albums Chart. The album has since gone Gold (100,000 copies) and spent a total 16 weeks in the Top 100 (including a re-entry at No 17 in 2020). &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; also charted within the Top 100 in Germany and within the Top 50 in Japan.

Four singles were released from the album. &quot;From Despair to Where&quot; was the lead single. &quot;La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)&quot; was the second single from the album and it has been described by many as its highlight. The third single, &quot;Roses in the Hospital&quot;, peaked at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart, the highest-charting single from the band&#x27;s first three albums. The fourth and final single, &quot;Life Becoming a Landslide&quot;, charted at number 36, which would be the lowest charting single by the band until 2011&#x27;s &quot;Some Kind of Nothingness&quot;.

In March 2020, following several anniversary re-releases of old albums in previous years, the Manics announced a deluxe reissue of &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; for release on 12 June 2020. Bonus content included previously unreleased demos, B-sides from the era, remixes, and a live recording, while the CD was released alongside a book of unseen photographs from the era with handwritten annotations and lyrics from the band.

== Reception ==
&quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; has received generally mixed reviews from critics.

Stuart Bailie, writing for the &quot;NME&quot;, called the album &quot;confusing&quot; and &quot;too much Slash and not enough burn&quot;, but did compliment its musicality, saying &quot;the drums and guitars rumble higher in the mix, and massive, harmonising riffs are everywhere&quot;. In his review for &quot;Vox&quot;, Keith Cameron remarked that the album showed Manic Street Preachers &quot;skating gingerly over that treacherous Difficult Second Album ice&quot;. &quot;Q&quot;″s Peter Kane was more critical, calling the album &quot;superficially competent, of course, but scratch below the surface and you&#x27;ll find few signs of life, just a vaguely expressed, bemused and bored dissatisfaction&quot;. In &quot;Spin&quot;, Simon Reynolds opined that the band &quot;motor-mouth a fine manifesto, but haven&#x27;t got a musical bone between them&quot;.

Among more favourable reviews, Stuart Maconie of &quot;Select&quot; praised the album as &quot;a mammoth development even from their excellent debut&quot; and &quot;almost without exception terrific&quot;, while &quot;Melody Maker&quot; remarked that the band had &quot;stayed beautiful&quot;. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; listed &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; at number 8 and number 25, respectively, in their end-of-year lists of the best albums of 1993.

=== Legacy ===
Both the &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; have since revised their opinions of &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; in some later articles, with the former&#x27;s Paul Stokes opining that its short, &quot;snappy, driven and focused&quot; length contrasts with other albums&#x27; &quot;indulgently lengthy tracklistings&quot;, and suggesting that &quot;with its big, radio-friendly Dave Eringa production, it&#x27;s easy to see why &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; caused such a stir compared to the wild, almost feral rock of &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; that preceded it a year earlier. However, with the band&#x27;s more beefed up, arena-friendly sound emerging in subsequent years, this album is no longer so at odds with the general Manics aesthetic.&quot; The latter publication, in a retrospective review of &quot;The Holy Bible&quot;, looked back on &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; as &quot;an underrated pop-metal effort that&#x27;s armed with a handful of bona-fide big tunes&quot;, and cited &quot;La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)&quot; as its highlight.

In his retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; as a &quot;flawed but intriguing second album&quot;. Sputnikmusic writer Dave de Sylvia called it &quot;a fine, and certainly underappreciated, album which fell victim to the weight of expectation generated by its predecessor and fell well short of the standard set by its successor, &quot;The Holy Bible&quot;, released the following year. The album has many flaws – it&#x27;s rushed; it&#x27;s formulaic in parts; the music was sometimes compromised in the search for a hit, but behind these flaws lies a solid rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll album with a deeper, more profound edge than most any other rock album you&#x27;ll hear.&quot; Joe Tangari of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, however, lambasted &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; as a &quot;labored, sophomore-slumping hard rock turd that had them looking washed up early&quot;, concluding that &quot;there was really no preparation for the intensity, perversion and genuine darkness of &quot;The Holy Bible&quot;&quot; which would follow in 1994.

&quot;It&#x27;s fair to say that history judged &quot;Gold…&quot; slightly unjustly,&quot; wrote &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot;″s Ben Patashnik in 2008. He added that the album was &quot;heavy, melodic and packed full of huge choruses: radio-friendly doesn’t have to be used in the pejorative sense and it&#x27;s certainly more considered and mature than their debut.&quot; Tom Ewing of &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot; hailed &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; as &quot;a half-classic of sensitive metal&quot; that built upon the style of the Manics&#x27; earlier single &quot;Motorcycle Emptiness&quot;. He highlighted the &quot;confused-nihilist persona internalised and fucked up to the point of collapse, while the riffs just keep on playing.&quot; In 2013, &quot;La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)&quot; was chosen by &quot;Clash&quot; as one of their favourite Manic Street Preachers singles.

&quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot; was given a deluxe re-issue in 2020 with each track remastered, complete with a 120-page A4 book of photos taken by Mitch Ikeda and scans of original lyric sheets plus previously unreleased demos. In his review for &quot;FMS Magazine&quot;, Jimi Arundell addresses the discomfort the band have previously expressed about the record; &quot;It seems that the band have exorcised the needless shame they have always seemed to carry for their second album, and finally given &quot;Gold Against The Soul&quot; the respect it deserves&quot;.

<doc id="459885" wikidata="Q684027" url="?curid=459885" title="Key Tower">
<text>Key Tower (formerly known as Society Center) is a skyscraper on Public Square in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. Designed by architect César Pelli, it is the tallest building in the state of Ohio, the 39th-tallest in the United States, and the 165th-tallest in the world. The building reaches 57 stories or to the top of its spire, and it is visible from up to away. The tower contains about 1.5 million square feet (139,355 m²) of office space.

Key Tower&#x27;s anchor tenant is KeyCorp, a major regional financial services firm. In 2014 the law firm of BakerHostetler announced that it would move its headquarters to the building, taking up several floors being vacated by KeyCorp. The international law firm Squire Patton Boggs is headquartered here and a major tenant. It is also headquarters to Dan T. Moore Companies, located on the 27th floor. Key Tower is connected to the Marriott at Key Center, built in conjunction with the tower, and the older Society for Savings Building. It was the tallest building between New York City and Chicago until 2007, and is the tallest building in the Midwest United States outside of Chicago.

In October 2008, Wells Real Estate Funds purchased Key Center, including Key Tower, Marriott at Key Center, Society for Savings Building, and the underground Memorial Plaza Garage. Key Tower was subsequently acquired by The Millennia Companies in 2017. The purchase price was $267.5 million.

==History==

It was originally built as the Society Center and was the headquarters for Cleveland-based Society Corporation. Society had recently acquired AmeriTrust and canceled AmeriTrust&#x27;s plans for an even taller (61-story) building on Public Square. Its opening ended the Terminal Tower&#x27;s 60-year reign as the tallest building in Ohio.

It was renamed Key Tower after Society merged with KeyCorp and took the KeyCorp name. Indeed, it was decided to make Cleveland the headquarters for the new KeyCorp because it was felt the then-Society Center was more commensurate with the merged bank&#x27;s status as a major bank. Pelli originally intended its design for the Norwest Center in Minneapolis, but a late change to the site led to Pelli designing a new tower for it.

Key Tower was developed by the Richard E. Jacobs Group.

When Society Center was completed in 1991 by Turner Construction, it became the tallest building between Chicago and New York City. The Comcast Center in Philadelphia assumed this distinction in 2007. The Chamber of Commerce Building stood on the tower&#x27;s site from 1898 to 1955.

&quot;F-111&quot;, James Rosenquist&#x27;s large pop art painting, hung in the tower&#x27;s lobby until building owner Richard Jacobs sold it to the Museum of Modern Art in 1996. He replaced it in 1998 with &quot;Songs for Sale&quot;, a mural by artist David Salle. In October 2005, Key Bank installed four long illuminated logos at the base of the tower&#x27;s crowning pyramid. Each sign weighs .

A smaller-scale building was proposed by Pelli to be built in Hartford, Connecticut, during the late 1980s, but the plan was ultimately canceled.

<text>UserLinux was a project to create an operating system based on Debian, and targeted at business customers. The goal was to provide businesses with a freely available, high quality operating system accompanied by certifications, service, and support options.

The project was initiated by Bruce Perens in late 2003. Subsequent to 2005 and the major success of Ubuntu, a commercial Linux distribution based on Debian by Canonical Ltd. with much the same aims as UserLinux, the project lost steam. No software was shipped, and the project was ultimately abandoned.

<text>John Henry Hammond Jr. (December 15, 1910 – July 10, 1987) was an American record producer, civil rights activist, and music critic active from the 1930s to the early 1980s. In his service as a talent scout, Hammond became one of the most influential figures in 20th-century popular music. He is the father of blues musician John P. Hammond.

Hammond was instrumental in sparking or furthering numerous musical careers, including those of Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Benny Goodman, Harry James, Charlie Christian, Billie Holiday, Count Basie, Teddy Wilson, Big Joe Turner, Fletcher Henderson, Pete Seeger, Babatunde Olatunji, Aretha Franklin, George Benson, Freddie Green, Leonard Cohen, Arthur Russell, Jim Copp, Asha Puthli, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Mike Bloomfield and Sonny Burke. He is also largely responsible for the revival of delta blues artist Robert Johnson&#x27;s music.

Hammond was portrayed by David Alan Basche in the 2024 film &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot;.

==Early years and family==
Hammond was born in New York, christened John Henry Hammond Jr., although both his father and paternal grandfather shared the same name. He was the youngest child and only son of John Henry Hammond and Emily Vanderbilt Sloane. His mother was one of three daughters of William Douglas Sloane and Emily Thorn Vanderbilt, and a granddaughter of William Henry Vanderbilt.

His father attended Yale University, and graduated with a law degree from Columbia Law School. His grandfather was Civil War General John Henry Hammond, who married Sophia Vernon Wolfe. His father was a brother of Ogden H. Hammond, ambassador to Spain, and uncle to politician Millicent Fenwick. Despite the family fortune from his mother&#x27;s side of the family, which included wealth from the W. &amp; J. Sloane chain, his father worked to provide for his family and maintain the family fortune. He worked &quot;as a banker, lawyer, and railroad executive&quot;. 

Hammond had four sisters: Emily, Adele, Rachel, and Alice. The youngest, Alice, married first Arthur Duckworth in 1927, and then, after divorcing him, the musician Benny Goodman in 1942. Well-known clergyman and peace activist William Sloane Coffin Jr. was a cousin.

Hammond showed interest in music from an early age. At four he began studying the piano, only to switch to the violin at age eight. He was steered toward classical music by his mother but was more interested in the music sung and played by the servants, many of whom were black. He was known to go down to his basement to listen to the upbeat music in the servants&#x27; quarters. He loved Sir Harry Lauder&#x27;s &quot;Roamin&#x27; in the Gloamin&#x27;&quot;. While he was in the basement, the rest of his family in the greater part of the five-story mansion would listen to &quot;the great opera tenor Enrico Caruso, as well as to standard classics by Beethoven, Brahms, and Mozart&quot;.

Hammond became interested in social reform at a young age. His mother also promoted social reform as a means to give back some of her fortune to the community. She often found solace in religion. Hammond shared her desire to help the community with his privilege.

Hammond notes that the first jazz music that he heard was in London in 1923 on a trip with his family. He heard a band called The Georgians, a white Dixieland jazz group, and saw an African American show called &quot;From Dixie to Broadway&quot;, that featured Sidney Bechet. This trip changed the way that he thought about music. Upon his return to the states, Hammond searched for records by black musicians but could not find them in the greater Manhattan area. He learned that African American music was sold in different stores, so he began to search for this music in Harlem.

In 1925 Hammond graduated from the elementary institution St. Bernard&#x27;s School at the age of 14. He persuaded his family to allow him to attend Hotchkiss School due to its liberal curriculum. Hammond&#x27;s love for music flourished. However, he felt limited within the confines of a boarding school. Hammond succeeded in convincing the headmaster to allow him to go into the city every other weekend, a rare privilege, so that he could take lessons from Ronald Murat. However, the headmaster was not aware that outside his formal lessons, Hammond would go up to Harlem to hear jazz. During this time, he said that he heard Bessie Smith perform at The Harlem Alhambra, but her biographer disagrees about the dates.

The summer after graduating from Hotchkiss in 1929, Hammond went to work for a newspaper in Maine, the &quot;Portland Evening News&quot;. Its editor Ernest Gruening was also a Hotchkiss alumnus, class of 1903, who was interested in social issues and social justice.

In the fall of 1929, Hammond entered Yale University as a member of the class of 1933. He studied the violin and, later, viola. He felt a disconnect with his fellow students at Yale and felt that he was already well acquainted with the professional world. He made frequent trips into New York city and wrote regularly for trade magazines. In the fall semester of 1930, Hammond had to withdraw due to a recurring case of jaundice. Hammond had no desire to a repeat a semester, which contributed to his dissatisfaction with the university lifestyle. Much to the disappointment of his father, a Yale alumnus, in 1931 he dropped out of school for a career in the music industry, first becoming the U.S. correspondent for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;.

==Career==
In 1931, Hammond funded the recording of pianist Garland Wilson, marking the beginning of a long string of artistic successes as record producer. He moved to Greenwich Village, where he claimed to have engaged in bohemian life and worked for an integrated music world. He set up one of the first regular live jazz programs, and wrote regularly about the racial divide. As he wrote in his memoirs, &quot;I heard no color line in the music... To bring recognition to the Negro&#x27;s supremacy in jazz was the most effective and constructive form of social protest I could think of.&quot; This pre-occupation with social issues was to continue, and in 1941 he was one of the founders of the Council on African Affairs.

In 1932, Hammond acquired a nonpaying job on the WEVD radio station as a disc jockey. He did not discriminate when choosing which musicians to air; the station allowed Hammond complete freedom on the station as long as he paid for his time slot. Through this position, Hammond gained a reputation as a well-educated jazz fan. Various musicians were guests on his show, including Fletcher Henderson, Benny Carter, and Art Tatum. When the station transferred from the Broadway Central Hotel to the Claridge Hotel, the new venue would not allow the black musicians to use the main elevator. For this reason, Hammond quit his work with WEVD.

By 1932–33, through his involvement in the UK music paper &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Hammond arranged for the faltering US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded Fletcher Henderson, Benny Carter, Joe Venuti, Benny Goodman, and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough during the Great Depression that many of them would not have otherwise had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US).

In 1934, Hammond is known to have introduced Benny Goodman and Fletcher Henderson. It is said that Hammond convinced the musicians to &#x27;swing&#x27; the current jazz hits, so that they could play in a free manner like the original New Orleans Jazz.

Hammond always strived for racial integration within the musical scene. For this purpose, he frequently visited musicians in Harlem in order to connect with musicians in their own area. While initially his race proved a problem in connecting with this community, he formed relationships with various musicians that allowed him to surpass this barrier. His friendship with Benny Carter gave him a status that allowed him to enter this musical community.

He played a role in organizing Benny Goodman&#x27;s band, and in persuading him to hire black musicians such as Charlie Christian, Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton. In 1933 he heard the seventeen-year-old Billie Holiday perform in Harlem and arranged for her recording debut, on a Benny Goodman session. Four years later, he heard the Count Basie orchestra broadcasting from Kansas City and brought it to New York, where it began to receive national attention.
In 1938, Hammond organized the first &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot; concert at Carnegie Hall, presenting a broad program of blues, jazz and gospel artists, including Ida Cox, Big Joe Turner, Albert Ammons, Pete Johnson, Meade &quot;Lux&quot; Lewis, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, the Count Basie orchestra, Sidney Bechet, Sonny Terry, James P. Johnson, and Big Bill Broonzy (who took the place of the deceased Robert Johnson). He coordinated a second &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot; concert in 1939.

After serving in the military during World War II, Hammond felt unmoved by the bebop jazz scene of the mid-1940s. Rejoining Columbia Records in the late 1950s, he signed Pete Seeger and Babatunde Olatunji to the label, and discovered Aretha Franklin, then an eighteen-year-old gospel singer. In 1961, he heard folk singer Bob Dylan playing harmonica on a session for Carolyn Hester; he signed him to Columbia and kept him on the label despite the protests of executives, who referred to Dylan as &quot;Hammond&#x27;s folly&quot;. He produced Dylan&#x27;s early recordings, &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; and &quot;A Hard Rain&#x27;s a-Gonna Fall&quot;.

Hammond oversaw the highly influential posthumous reissues of Robert Johnson&#x27;s recorded work (produced by Frank Driggs), convincing Columbia Records to issue the album &quot;King of the Delta Blues Singers&quot; in 1961. Musicians Hammond signed to the label included Leonard Cohen and Bruce Springsteen.

Hammond retired from Columbia in 1975 but continued to scout for talent. In 1983, he brought guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan to Columbia and was credited as executive producer on his debut album.

==Personal accounts==
Hammond recognized jazz music to have originated as an African-American musical genre. When Hammond entered the jazz community, integration had not yet begun. Black and white musicians rarely played together and often the prestigious locations permitted only white audiences. Hammond remembers that before the 1920s, black musicians could always find jobs, even if they were low paying. After the instatement of Local 802, a union of professional musicians within New York City, Hammond saw more white people receiving jobs than black people. However, this did not stop the African-American musicians. Through burlesque and record making, these musicians continued to be a presence.

1933 was a defining year for Hammond. He remembers this year being extraordinary due to his establishment of relationships with British record companies. Hammond was able to secure contracts for various musicians. He was an attractive producer to these companies because he did not desire a profit for himself. In 1933, he helped Benny Goodman receive a record deal with Columbia Records, which at the time was only known as English Columbia. During this time, Goodman was in need of a big break, as he was getting a reputation as being difficult to work with. Hammond proposed that Goodman produce a multiracial record; however, Goodman believed this route would hurt his musical reputation.

In this year, Hammond broke out of the traditional role of a producer and became a talent scout, after hearing Billie Holiday. He remarks that he was astounded to discover that she was the daughter of Clarence Holiday from Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s band. That same year, he was able to get her involved in the Benny Goodman Orchestra. Hammond attributes fate to his finding of Holiday. After hearing her sing for the first time, he wrote, &quot;She weighs over 200 pounds, is incredibly beautiful, and sings as well as anybody I have ever heard.&quot;

Later in 1933, he heard Teddy Wilson, a jazz pianist, on the Chicago radio. While he did not discover him, he was able to provide significant opportunities for him, even some collaboration with Billie Holiday.

Hammond&#x27;s work with civil rights came from multiple angles. In 1933, he traveled South to attend a trial regarding the Scottsboro case, a case in which two white girls accused nine black boys of raping them. The testimonies of the two girls did not align with the story. While all nine boys were convicted, Hammond viewed this trial as a &quot;catalyst for black activism&quot;.

Record integration became an important component of jazz music. Starting in 1935, musicians began to record in mixed-race groups. While some of this integration had already taken place, Hammond remembers it as being hidden. However, in 1935, the Goodman Trio began recording. In 1936, the group appeared in a live concert at the Chicago Hot Jazz Society. Hammond fondly remembers this as an innovative moment in jazz history.

==FBI investigation==
J. Edgar Hoover, FBI director, investigated Hammond&#x27;s link to the Communist Party. Due to the various benefits and fund-raisers that Hammond hosted for the popular front, his name was often listed in &quot;The Daily Worker&quot;, a communist newspaper. Furthermore, his name often appeared on the letterheads of left-wing organizations for which he was a donor or member. Hammond was never a member of the Communist Party.

==Personal life==
Hammond had four sisters: Alice, Rachel, Adele, and Emily.

Early in his career, Hammond focused more on his work than his love life. While he was seen publicly with various women, the relationships were never substantial. However, in 1940 at a Manhattan party, Hammond met Jemison &quot;Jemy&quot; McBride. On March 8, 1941, Hammond married Jemy in New Haven, Connecticut. The couple had a small, non-denominational wedding with only about ten guests. Although both sets of parents approved of the couple, neither set attended the wedding.

In 1942, Hammond took his wife on a road trip to Los Angeles. Shortly after this trip, Jemy realized that she was pregnant. In November 1942, Jemy gave birth to their first son, John P. Hammond.

On March 21, 1942, Hammond&#x27;s sister, Alice married Benny Goodman. She had previously been married to Englishman Arthur Duckworth, a member of the British House of Commons. Hammond did not look kindly upon her marriage to Goodman. After years of arguments and disagreements about the musical directions of Goodman&#x27;s band, Hammond and Goodman had a complete falling out, some of which has been attributed to their differing class and educational backgrounds (Goodman had been born into poverty and had quit high school in order to help support his family as a musician). Hammond, however, could be dogmatic and controlling in his interactions with various musicians, as well as in his published writings on jazz and on specific performers. Goodman eventually grew weary of Hammond&#x27;s contentious nature. However, out of a sense of shared grief following Alice&#x27;s death in 1978, Hammond and Goodman reconciled.

In November 1943, after the United States entered World War II, Hammond began military training. He underwent his basic training at Fort Belvoir. Hammond was much older than the majority of the other men, and he had a rough time adjusting to the military life. While he was still in basic training, Jemy gave birth to their second child, Douglas, early in 1944. Douglas came down with a serious illness. While Jemy sent Hammond a telegram to alert him of his newborn&#x27;s condition, Hammond said that he never received it. Jemy speculated that Hammond was in a concert and disregarded the letter; however, that claim has been proven unlikely due to Hammond&#x27;s strict schedule in basic training. Douglas died shortly after birth from his illness, and Jemy had to undergo the family tragedy without her husband. Hammond returned after basic training on a three-day pass, but he and his wife were distant.

After basic training, Hammond reported to Camp Plauche, where he was placed to organize activities for the black soldiers. During this time period, African-American soldiers were given little to do within the military. The armed forces were still segregated and discriminatory. Hammond began his efforts by organizing concerts for the soldiers featuring African-American musicians. He noted that shortly after these concerts began, an integrated sports team formed. Toward the end of World War II, Hammond was transferred to Fort Benning, Georgia, known for its intense racism. Hammond was not the only jazz fan irritated with racism. During this time period, bebop music grew out of late night jam sessions of black musicians. Hammond was not much a part of the bebop movement, but he shared the sentiment against racism.

In 1946, Hammond was discharged from the military. His family moved to Greenwich Village, where Jemy gave birth to their third son, Jason. Hammond threw himself back into his work, which greatly upset his wife. In 1948, Jemy asked Hammond for a divorce. While he was originally reluctant, Hammond agreed to the divorce. Jemy never remarried.

A year later, in 1949, Hammond met Esme Sarnoff, originally Esme O&#x27;Brien, the former wife of NBC chairman Robert Sarnoff, and a daughter of Mary and Esmond O&#x27;Brien. Esme shared Hammond&#x27;s musical passion and was planning to divorce her husband. That year, Hammond married Esme Sarnoff. By this marriage Hammond had one stepdaughter, (Esme) Rosita Sarnoff (born 1943). During this time, Hammond&#x27;s father died on a golf course. Left a widow, Emily Hammond became infatuated with Frank Buchman.

In 1985, Hammond had his first stroke. Although this impaired him physically, his wife&#x27;s death left him in despair. Esme Hammond was diagnosed with breast cancer. While treatments worked for some time, she died May 19, 1986, of complications of AIDS, which she had contracted from a blood transfusion. Hammond was distraught and died on July 10, 1987, after a series of strokes. It is said that he died listening to the music of Billie Holiday.

==Legacy==
&quot;John&#x27;s Idea&quot;, originally titled &quot;I May Be Wrong It&#x27;s John&#x27;s Idea&quot;, is a tribute to John Hammond written by Count Basie.

Hammond received a Grammy Trustees Award for being credited with co-producing a Bessie Smith reissue in 1971, and in 1986 was the inaugural recipient of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Lifetime Achievement Award.

Hammond&#x27;s son, John P. Hammond, became an American blues musician.

Hammond was one of the first men to racially integrate the American music industry. Before the Civil Rights Act passed, Tom Wilson, an African American, replaced Hammond as Bob Dylan&#x27;s record producer.

In December 2015 Guinness featured Hammond in its UK advertising campaign.

Prince&#x27;s song &quot;Avalanche&quot; mentions Hammond in the lyric &quot;Mr. John Hammond with his pen in hand... Sayin&#x27; &#x27;Sign your kingdom over to me and be known throughout the land!&#x27;&quot;

=== Early life ===

Saichō was born in the year 767 in the city of Ōmi, in present Shiga Prefecture, with the given name of Hirono. According to family tradition, Saichō&#x27;s ancestors were descendants of emperors of Eastern Han China; however, no positive evidence exists for this claim. The region where Saichō was born did have a large Chinese immigrant population, so Saichō likely did have Chinese ancestry.

During Saichō&#x27;s time, the Buddhist temples in Japan were officially organized into a national network known as the provincial temple system, and at the age of 13, Saichō became a disciple of one Gyōhyō (722–797, 行表). He took tonsure as a novice monk at the age of 14 and was given the ordination name &quot;Saichō&quot;. Gyōhyō in turn was a disciple of Dao-xuan (702–760, 道璿, Dōsen in Japanese), a prominent monk from China of the Tiantai school who had brought the East Mountain Teaching of Chan Buddhism, Huayan teachings and the Bodhisattva Precepts of the &quot;Brahmajala Sutra&quot; to Japan in 736 and served as the &quot;precept master&quot; for ordination prior to the arrival of Jianzhen.

By the age of 20, he undertook the full monastic precepts at the Tōdai-ji, thus becoming a fully ordained monk in the official temple system. A few months later he abruptly retreated to Mount Hiei for an intensive study and practice of Buddhism, though the exact reason for his departure remains unknown. Shortly after his retreat, he composed his which included his personal vows to: 
# So long as I have not attained the stage where my six faculties are pure, I will not venture out into the world.
# So long as I have not realized the absolute, I will not acquire any special skills or arts [e.g. medicine, divination, calligraphy, etc.].
# So long as I have not kept all the precepts purely, I will not participate in any lay donor&#x27;s Buddhist meetings.
# So long as I have not attained wisdom (lit. &quot;hannya&quot; 般若), I will not participate in worldly affairs unless it be to benefit others.
# May any merit from my practice in the past, present and future be given not to me, but to all sentient beings so that they may attain supreme enlightenment.

In time, Saichō attracted other monks both on Mount Hiei, and from the Buddhist community in Nara, and a monastic community developed on Mount Hiei, which eventually became Enryaku-ji. Saichō was said to have carved an image of the Bhaiṣajyaguru and enshrined it. Additionally, he lit a lamp of oil before the Buddha and prayed that the lamp would never be extinguished. This lamp is now known as the and has remained lit for 1200 years.

The capital of Japan was moved from Nara to Nagaoka-kyō in 784, and then to Kyoto in 795. Because Mount Hiei was coincidentally located to the northeast of Kyoto, a direction considered dangerous according to Chinese geomancy, Saichō&#x27;s presence on the mountain was thought to protect the new capital and brought him to the attention of the court. Saichō and his community on Mount Hiei also started to correspond and exchange ceremonies with the established communities in Nara, in addition to the monks at the Court, further enhancing his prestige.

One of Saichō&#x27;s earliest supporters in the Court was Wake no Hiroyo, who invited Saichō to give lectures at Takaosan-ji along with fourteen other eminent monks. Saichō was not the first to be invited, indicating that he was still relatively unknown in the Court, but rising in prominence.

=== Trip to China ===

The success of the Takaosanji lectures, plus Saichō&#x27;s association with Wake no Hiroyo soon caught the attention of Emperor Kanmu who consulted with Saichō about propagating his Buddhist teachings further, and to help bridge the traditional rivalry between the East Asian Yogācāra and East Asian Mādhyamaka schools.

The emperor granted a petition by Saichō to journey to China to further study Tiantai doctrine in China and bring back more texts. Saichō was expected to only remain in China for a short time however.

Saichō could read Chinese but was unable to speak it at all, thus he was allowed to bring a trusted disciple along named , who apparently could speak Chinese. Gishin would later become one of the head monks of the Tendai order after Saichō.

Saichō was part of the four-ship diplomatic mission to Tang China in 803. The ships were forced to turn back due to heavy winds, where they spent some time at Dazaifu, Fukuoka. During this time, Saichō likely met another passenger, Kūkai, a fellow Buddhist monk who was sent to China on a similar mission though he was expected to stay much longer.

When the ships set sail again, two sank during a heavy storm, but Saichō&#x27;s ship arrived at the port of Ningbo, then known as Mingzhou (), in northern Zhejiang in 804. Shortly after arrival, permission was granted for Saichō and his party to travel to Tiantai Mountain and he was introduced to the seventh Patriarch of Tiantai, Daosui (), who became his primary teacher during his time in China. Daosui was instrumental in teaching Saichō about Tiantai methods of meditation, monastic discipline and orthodox teachings. Saichō remained under this instruction for approximately 135 days.

Saichō spent the next several months copying various Buddhist works with the intention of bringing them back to Japan with him. While some works existed in Japan already, Saichō felt that they suffered from copyist errors or other defects, and so he made fresh copies. Once the task was completed, Saichō and his party returned to Ningbo, but the ship was harbored in Fuzhou at the time, and would not return for six weeks.

During this time, Saichō went to Yuezhou (越州, modern-day Shaoxing) and sought out texts and information on Vajrayana (Esoteric) Buddhism. The Tiantai school originally only utilized &quot;mixed&quot; () ceremonial practices, but over time esoteric Buddhism took on a greater role. By the time Saichō had arrived in China, a number of Tiantai Buddhist centers provided esoteric training, and both Saichō and Gishin received initiation at a temple in Yue Prefecture. However, it&#x27;s unclear what transmission or transmissions(s) they received. Some evidence suggests that Saichō did not receive the dual ( transmissions of the Diamond Realm and the Womb Realm. Instead, it is thought he may have only received the Diamond Realm transmission, but the evidence is not conclusive one way or the other.

Finally, on the tenth day of the fifth month of 805, Saichō and his party returned to Ningbo and after compiling further bibliographies, boarded the ship back for Japan and arrived in Tsushima on the fifth day of the sixth month. Although Saichō had only stayed in China for a total of eight months, his return was eagerly awaited by the court in Kyoto.

=== Founding of Tendai ===

On his return from China, Saichō worked hard to win recognition from the court and &quot;in the first month of 806, Saichō&#x27;s Tendai Lotus school (&quot;Tendai-hokke-shū&quot; 天台法華宗) won official recognition when the court of the ailing emperor Kanmu issued another edict, this one permitting two annual ordinands (&quot;nenbundosha&quot;) for Saichō&#x27;s new school on Mount Hiei. This edict states that, following Saichō&#x27;s request, the ordinands would be divided between two curricula: the &quot;shanagō&quot; course, centering on the study of the Mahavairocana Sūtra (this was the Mikkyō curriculum, shana being the abbreviation for Birushana, the Japanese transliteration of Vairocana), and the shikangō course, based on the study of the &quot;Mohe Zhiguan&quot;, the seminal work of the Tiantai patriarch Zhiyi 智顗 (538–597) (this was the Tendai curriculum, &quot;shikan&quot; being the Japanese reading of Zhiyi&#x27;s central practice of &quot;zhiguan&quot; [cessation and contemplation]) (&quot;Kenkairon engi&quot;, DZ 1, pp. 294–296). Thus from its very inception the Tendai Lotus school was equally based on Mikkyō and Tiantai. It was as a subdivision of Saichō&#x27;s new school that Mikkyō first received the official acknowledgment of the imperial court and became a proper subject of study in Japanese Buddhism.

Before Saichō, all monastic ordinations took place at Tōdai-ji temple under the ancient Vinaya code, but Saichō intended to found his school as a strictly Mahayana institution and ordain monks using the Bodhisattva Precepts only. Despite intense opposition from the traditional Buddhist schools in Nara, his request was granted by Emperor Saga in 822, several days after his death. This was the fruit of years of effort and a formal debate.

=== Decline and Death ===
By 822, Saichō petitioned the court to allow the monks at Mount Hiei to ordain under the Bodhisattva Precepts rather than the traditional ordination system of the &quot;prātimokṣa&quot;, arguing that his community would be a purely Mahayana, not Hinayana one. This was met with strong protest by the Buddhist establishment who supported the &quot;kokubunji&quot; system, and lodged a protest. Saichō composed the , which stressed the significance of the Bodhisattva Precepts, but his request was still rejected until 7 days after his death at the age of 56.

== Relationship with Kūkai ==
Saichō traveled to China along with a number of other young monks, one of whom was named Kūkai. Saichō befriended him during his trip to China who traveled with him going and coming. This turned out to be pivotal to the future development of Buddhism.
, and likewise returned with esoteric (tantric) Buddhist texts. Saichō was entranced with the new material and wanted to learn more. On the trip back he found that Kukai had studied these teachings in depth and had an entire library of vajrayana materials. This friendship would influence the future of Tendai.
It was Saichō who performed the &quot;abhiṣeka&quot;, or initiatory ritual, for the court.
== The identity of the purport of Perfect and Esoteric teachings ==

Thus esoteric Buddhism became an important aspect of the Tendai school, which was primarily focused on the Lotus Sutra. However, unlike the Shingon school (which saw esoteric practice as superior to the Lotus Sutra), Saichō held to the &quot;identity of the purport of Perfect and Esoteric teachings&quot; (&quot;enmitsu itchi&quot; 円密一致) which means there is a unity and agreement among the teachings of the Lotus Sutra and Esoteric Buddhism.&quot;
Saichō, in a letter to Kukai, wrote:But the Vairocana school (&quot;shanashu&quot; 遮那宗) and Tendai interfuse with one another. They also share the same commentary... There should be no such thing as preferring one to the other. The Lotus and the Golden Light are those texts to which the previous emperor Kanmu] devoted himself, and there exists no difference between the One Unifying Vehicle [of Tendai] and Shingon.Paul Groner states,
 Tendai and Esoteric practices, he felt, provided a direct path (&quot;jikidō&quot;) to enlightenment, whereas the teachings of the Nara schools required aeons to bring the practitioner to enlightenment.

However,

Moreover, Saichō began to realize that his own idea of &quot;enmitsu itchi&quot; was not exactly shared by the esoteric Shingon school, and especially its founder Kūkai (Kōbō Daishi).

Ryuichi Abe writes,

Saichō&#x27;s late life criticisms were ignored by his own leading disciples, and the Tendai would continue to teach Mikkyō and Shikangō (&quot;śamatha-vipaśyanā&quot;). Saichō&#x27;s public condemnation of Kūkai would later form the seeds for some of the criticisms leveled by Nichiren (1222–1282), the founder of Nichiren Buddhism, who would cite that work in his own debates in the Kamakura period.

Saichō was also an author. He wrote a number of texts, the main ones include:

* (818–819)
* (818)
* (820)

<doc id="459891" wikidata="Q270966" url="?curid=459891" title="Reggie Miller">
<text>Reginald Wayne Miller (born August 24, 1965) is an American former professional basketball player who played his entire 18-year career in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the Indiana Pacers. Widely recognized as one of the greatest shooters in NBA history, he was known for his precision three-point shooting, especially in pressure situations and most notably against the New York Knicks, for which he earned the nickname &quot;Knick Killer&quot;. A five-time All-Star selection, Miller was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2012 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.

Miller played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, earning third-team All-American honors as a junior in 1986. He was selected by Indiana in the first round of the 1987 NBA draft with the 11th overall pick. When he retired from playing, Miller held the NBA record for most career 3-point field goals made. He is currently sixth on the list behind Stephen Curry, James Harden, Ray Allen, Damian Lillard and Klay Thompson. Miller led the league in free throw percentage five times and won a gold medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics. His 31 was retired by the Pacers in 2006. Miller is widely regarded as the Pacers&#x27; greatest player of all time. After his playing career, he became an NBA commentator for TNT and college basketball analyst for CBS Sports.

==Early life==
Miller was born in Riverside, California, and attended Riverside Polytechnic High School. He was born with hip deformities, which prevented him from walking correctly. After a few years of continuously wearing braces on both legs, his leg strength grew enough to compensate.

One of five siblings, he comes from an athletic family. His brother Darrell is a former Major League Baseball player; his sister Tammy played volleyball at Cal State Fullerton; and his older sister Cheryl is also a Hall of Fame basketball player. Cheryl was a member of the 1984 U.S. gold medal-winning Olympic basketball team and is an analyst for Turner Sports. One of the family anecdotes Reggie likes to recall was when Cheryl used to beat him in games of 1-on-1 prior to his professional career. According to Reggie, they quit playing when he could finally block Cheryl&#x27;s shots.

Miller says his unorthodox shooting style was developed to arc his shot over his sister&#x27;s constant shot blocking. His brother, Saul Jr., became a musician and followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps in military service.

==College==

Miller attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he received a degree in history. In the 1984–85 NCAA season he helped the UCLA Bruins to an NIT championship. In Miller&#x27;s senior season, 1986–87, he was an All-Pac-10 selection for the second straight year, and led the Bruins to a Pacific-10 regular-season championship and the first Pac-10 tournament championship.

The three-point field goal was added for the 1986–87 season; 69 of Miller&#x27;s 247 field goals that year were three-pointers. One of his most memorable performances was in the January 24, 1987, game against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, where he hit a shot to put the Bruins ahead 62–59 with 10 seconds left. Another notable game was a win against defending national champion Louisville and Pervis Ellison on February 28, 1987, where Miller scored 33 points in the second half, which is still the school record.

Miller&#x27;s final game was a loss in the second round of the 1987 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament to Wyoming. He finished second in all-time scoring at UCLA behind only Lew Alcindor (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar).

As of 2009, Miller still holds the UCLA single-season records for most league points, highest league scoring average, and most free throws. He also holds several individual game records. UCLA retired his No. 31 jersey in 2013, and he was inducted into the Pac-12 Conference Hall of Honor in 2010.

==NBA career==
===Early career (1987–1993)===
Miller was selected by the Pacers with the 11th pick in the first round of the 1987 NBA draft. Fans were initially upset that the Pacers chose Miller over New Castle, Indiana, native Steve Alford; fans watching the 1987 NBA draft booed Pacers President Donnie Walsh for the selection. Miller wore jersey number 31 while playing for the Pacers, backing up shooting guard John Long before he became a starter. Miller gained a respectable reputation early in his career as he led the Indiana Pacers to become a perennial playoff team.

After Chuck Person was traded from the Pacers during the 1992 offseason, Miller established himself as the Pacers&#x27; primary scoring threat. On November 28, 1992, he scored a career-high 57 points against the Charlotte Hornets in a 134–122 win at Charlotte Coliseum. In this game, Miller hit 16 of 29 field goals, 4 of 11 3-pointers, and 21 of 23 free throws. The 57 points he scored was the second-highest total in the NBA during the 1992–93 season (only Michael Jordan&#x27;s 64 against Orlando on January 16 was higher), and still stands today as the Pacers&#x27; NBA franchise team record, although George McGinnis holds the Pacers all-time franchise record with 58 points in an ABA game.

===Mid-career (1993–2000)===
Miller became a household name during the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals against the Knicks, due to a phenomenal shooting performance in Game 5 on June 1, 1994, in which he scored 39 points (25 in the fourth quarter alone) in the Pacers&#x27; 93–86 victory at Madison Square Garden. Miller made several long 3-pointers during the quarter and engaged in an animated discussion of his ongoing performance with noted Knicks fan Spike Lee, who was, as always, seated courtside. The win gave the Pacers a 3–2 series lead over the heavily favored Knicks, but they lost the next two games and the series.
====&quot;Eight points in nine seconds&quot;====
On May 7, 1995, Miller scored eight unanswered points in 8.9 seconds in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Knicks, leading the Pacers to a 107–105 victory. With 18.7 seconds remaining and the Pacers trailing 105–99, Miller took the inbound pass from Mark Jackson, made a 3-pointer, stole the inbound pass from Anthony Mason, dribbled back behind the arc and tied the game with another 3, stunning the crowd at Madison Square Garden. On the ensuing possession, Knicks guard John Starks was fouled by Sam Mitchell. Starks missed both free throws, and although Patrick Ewing managed to get the offensive rebound, his shot was just a bit long and hit the back rim. Miller got the rebound and was fouled with 7.5 seconds left. He made both free throws. Trailing by 2, New York had one last chance to win the game but failed to get a shot off, giving the Pacers a shocking 1–0 lead in the best-of-seven series.

The Pacers outlasted the Knicks in seven games before losing to the Orlando Magic in the Conference Finals in seven games, just like the previous year. 

Near the end of the 1996 season, Miller fell to the floor and suffered an eye injury, leaving him unable to play in the playoffs until Game 5 of the first round against the Atlanta Hawks, where he wore goggles until the Pacers were eliminated. Around this time, Miller hosted a talk show on WTHR called &quot;The Reggie Miller Show&quot;. 

After missing the playoffs in the 1997 season, the Pacers returned to the postseason in 1998. They defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers and Knicks en route to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they faced Michael Jordan and the defending champion Bulls. On May 25, 1998, the Pacers trailed Chicago 2–1 in the series and were behind 94–93 in Game 4 at home in Market Square Arena with 2.9 seconds left. Miller got free from Jordan, caught the inbound pass from Derrick McKey, turned and made a game-winning 3-pointer with 0.7 seconds to go. The Pacers eventually pushed the series to Game 7 in Chicago, where the Pacers led in the fourth quarter before fading in the final two minutes. The Bulls won 88–83 and went on to win their sixth and final championship of the Michael Jordan/Scottie Pippen era.

With Jordan retired, Miller and the Pacers were considered a favorite in the East heading into the lockout-shortened 1999 season. After earning the No. 2 seed in the East, the Pacers once again met the Knicks in the Eastern Conference Finals, where the eighth-seeded Knicks upset the Pacers in six games. In the decisive sixth game, Miller had one of the worst performances of his career, scoring just eight points on 3-of-18 shooting from the field. He missed all but one of his eight 3-point attempts.

====NBA Finals appearance====

In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Philadelphia 76ers on May 6, 2000, Miller and teammate Jalen Rose each scored 40 points, becoming the highest-scoring pair of teammates in playoff history, in the Pacers&#x27; 108–91 victory. The Pacers won that series 4–2 and returned to the Eastern Conference Finals for the fifth time in seven years. This time they finally broke through, defeating the rival Knicks 4–2. Game 6 at Madison Square Garden on June 2, 2000, was sealed by Miller&#x27;s 34 points, with 17 coming in the fourth quarter to help Indiana clinch the series with a 93–80 victory over the Knicks.

The Pacers advanced to the NBA Finals for the first and only time in franchise history, facing the Los Angeles Lakers led by Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Kobe Bryant. The Pacers lost the series 4–2 as Miller averaged 24.3 points per game for the series.

===Later career and retirement (2000–2005)===
The Pacers struggled the next year, falling to the 8th seed in the East. In Game 1 of the First Round of the playoffs against the 76ers, Miller hit the game-winning three with 2.9 seconds left to secure a 79–78 victory. The eventual Eastern Conference champion 76ers took the next three games to give the Pacers a quick exit.
In 2002, Miller almost single-handedly eliminated the top seed and eventual Eastern Conference Champion New Jersey Nets in the fifth and final game of the first round of the playoffs. After New Jersey&#x27;s Richard Jefferson missed two free throws, Miller sent the game into overtime by banking in a three-pointer at the buzzer. With the Pacers down by two points in the final seconds of the first overtime, Miller drove into the lane and dunked over three Nets defenders to send the game into a second overtime. The Pacers lost to the Nets 120–109, but Miller burnished his record as a clutch performer.

In the twilight of his career, Miller deferred team leadership to All-Star teammate Jermaine O&#x27;Neal, who urged his teammates to &quot;win one [a championship] for &#x27;Uncle Reg&#x27;&quot;. While Miller was no longer the team&#x27;s leading scorer, he remained a go-to player in crunch time. O&#x27;Neal demonstrated his respect for Miller on January 4, 2005, when he scored 55 points against the Milwaukee Bucks and then left the game with 1:43 remaining to preserve Miller&#x27;s 57-point record.

In 2005, following the lengthy suspensions of star teammates O&#x27;Neal, Stephen Jackson, and Ron Artest for a brawl with fans in Detroit, Miller averaged nearly 20 points per game for stretches of the season. He scored 39 points against the Los Angeles Lakers on March 18 at the age of 39. In January, Miller angrily shot down rumors that he would retire at the end of the season, saying that if he did decide to retire, he would announce it through his sister Cheryl. On February 10, Cheryl, now a sideline reporter for TNT, reported that her brother had told her the previous day that he would indeed retire.
On April 11, in a game against the Toronto Raptors, Miller passed Jerry West to move into 12th on the NBA&#x27;s all-time scoring list.

Miller&#x27;s last game was on May 19, 2005, at Conseco Fieldhouse, when the Pacers lost 88–79 to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, ending the series 4–2. In the game, Miller led the Pacers with 27 points, making 11 out of 16 field goals including four of eight three-pointers. When he was taken out with 15.7 seconds to play, the Indianapolis crowd gave him a final standing ovation. Then-Pistons coach (and former Pacers coach) Larry Brown called an additional timeout during which the Pistons players joined in the ovation, a moment which provided closure to Miller&#x27;s career and to a season that had been overshadowed by the brawl between the two teams. This won the 2005 Best Moment ESPY Award.

Over his 18-year NBA career, Miller made over $105 million in salary, playing in 1,389 games for the Pacers. He is one of seven NBA players who spent an entire career of 18 or more seasons with a single franchise. He is widely recognized as one of the greatest shooters in NBA history. Miller is one of only nine players to join the 50–40–90 club and has made 2,560 3-pointers in his career, which was an NBA record at the time of his retirement. His record was later broken by Ray Allen, who was later surpassed by Stephen Curry. To commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Miller as the 47th greatest player in NBA history.

==National team career==
Miller was a member of two gold medal-winning teams, the US national team for the 1994 FIBA World Championship and the Olympic men&#x27;s basketball team in 1996. He averaged 17.1 points, 52.6% shooting, and was 19 for 20 from free throws and was second-leading scorer behind Shaquille O&#x27;Neal in the 1994 tournament. In 1996, he averaged 11.4 points and had the second-highest total points (91). He started 5 out of the 8 games and shared the shooting guard rotation with Mitch Richmond. He did not return to the USA Team until the 2002 FIBA World Championship. The 2002 team did not win that year&#x27;s championship, losing to FR Yugoslavia in the quarterfinals. The tournament marked the first time that NBA players competed against international competition and lost. Miller was injured during the 2002 World Championships and played limited minutes.

==Off the court==
Miller served as the 2005 Indianapolis 500 Festival Parade Grand Marshal. Archbishop Daniel M. Buechlein, OSB of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis opened the day with the prayer &quot;Keep these drivers safe and God bless Reggie!&quot; before Miller waved the green flag to start the race.

In August 2005, Miller announced his plans to join TNT as an NBA analyst; his sister, Cheryl is an NBA sideline reporter for the network. Miller once served as guest host of the network television talk show &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, filling in for host Regis Philbin. Miller is currently a host on TNT&#x27;s NBA coverage and also answers &quot;Reggie&#x27;s Mailbag&quot;.

Miller&#x27;s number 31 was retired at halftime in a ceremony on March 30, 2006, at Conseco Fieldhouse.

In June 2005, Miller also became a weekly contributor to &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot; on ESPN Radio, providing the show with commentary.
Beginning in 2011, Miller has worked as a TV analyst for the NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship tournament.

Miller currently splits his time between residences in Malibu, California, and Fishers, Indiana. Miller previously put his Fishers mansion, located on Geist Reservoir, up for sale for $7.5 million. The listing has since been removed without Miller selling the residence.

On August 8, 2007, Boston Celtics general manager Danny Ainge and head coach Doc Rivers discussed with him about joining their revamped roster including Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, and longtime Celtic Paul Pierce in a reserve role. On August 12, his former coach Rick Carlisle was quoted as saying &quot;we (Miller and I) talked about it and agreed that it was something that deserved careful consideration.&quot; On August 24, 2007, his 42nd birthday, Miller decided against any comeback, stating: &quot;Physically, I know I could have done it. But mentally, when you do something like this, you&#x27;ve either got to be all in or all out. And I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;m all out.&quot;
A documentary titled &quot;Winning Time: Reggie Miller vs. the New York Knicks&quot; premiered to the public on March 14, 2010, on ESPN. Miller announced in December 2009 that there would be a Special Premiere Movie event on Friday, Feb 26, at Conseco Fieldhouse. The documentary was directed by Peabody Award-winner Dan Klores.

During his career, he performed a voice role in the Disney-animated TV series &quot;Hercules&quot;; after retirement, he appeared in a comedy role in &quot;Uncle Drew&quot; in 2018 and appeared in the seventeenth season of the American reality competition television series &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; as one of the guest celebrity athletes assigned to contestants to serve as culinary students.

In December 2020 he was voted onto the USA Cycling Board of Directors.

In 2025, Miller will join NBC as a game analyst for its NBA coverage beginning in the 2025–26 season. He joins NBC after having been at TNT, which had lost live NBA game rights, since 2005.

<text>Earl Talbot is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of Great Britain. This branch of the Talbot family descends from the Hon. Sir Gilbert Talbot (died 1518), third son of John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury. His great-great-great-grandson, the Right Reverend William Talbot, was Bishop of Oxford, of Salisbury and of Durham. His eldest son Charles Talbot was a prominent lawyer and politician. In 1733, he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Lord Talbot, Baron of Hensol, in the County of Glamorgan, and then served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1733 to 1737.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He served as Lord Steward of the Household from 1761 to 1782. In 1761, he was created Earl Talbot and in 1780, Baron Dynevor, of Dynevor in the County of Carmarthen, in the Peerage of Great Britain. The earldom was created with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body, while the barony was created with remainder to his daughter Cecil, wife of George Rice, and her issue male.

==Subsequent history==
On William Talbot&#x27;s death in 1782, the earldom became extinct, while he was succeeded in the barony of Dynevor according to the special remainder by his daughter Cecil (see the Baron Dynevor article for later history of this branch of the family). The barony of Talbot was passed on to his nephew John, the third Baron. He was the son of the Hon. John Talbot (d. 1756), younger son of the first Baron, and his wife the Hon. Catherine Chetwynde, daughter of John Chetwynde, 2nd Viscount Chetwynde. He represented Castle Rising in the House of Commons. In 1784, the earldom was revived when he was made Viscount of Ingestre, in the County of Stafford, and Earl Talbot, of Hensol in the County of Glamorgan. Both titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Talbot assumed by Royal licence the surname and arms of Chetwynd in 1786.

On his death, the titles passed to his son, the second Earl. He served under the Earl of Liverpool as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1817 to 1821. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the third Earl. In 1856, on the death of his distant relative Bertram Arthur Talbot, 17th Earl of Shrewsbury and 17th Earl of Waterford, he succeeded as eighteenth Earl of Shrewsbury and eighteenth Earl of Waterford. For more information on him and for further history of the peerages, see the Earl of Shrewsbury.

Several members of junior branches of the family have also gained distinction:
*The Hon. John Chetwynd-Talbot, fourth son of the second Earl Talbot, was the father of:
:1. John Gilbert Talbot, Member of Parliament from 1868 to 1910, who was admitted to the Privy Council in 1897 and who was the father of:

::Dame Meriel Lucy Talbot, a women&#x27;s welfare worker, and
:2. The Right Reverend Edward Stuart Talbot, Bishop of Winchester from 1911 to 1923, who was the father of
::the Right Reverend Neville Stuart Talbot, Bishop of Pretoria from 1920 to 1932.

<doc id="459896" wikidata="Q1495634" url="?curid=459896" title="Mikoyan-Gurevich I-270">
<text>The Mikoyan-Gurevich I-270 (Design Ж (&quot;Zh&quot;) under Mikoyan-Gurevich&#x27;s in-house designation sequence, USAF/DoD designation: Type 11) was a response to a Soviet Air Forces requirement in 1945 for a rocket-powered interceptor aircraft for the point-defence role. In concept and basic configuration, it was related to the early Korolyov RP-318 rocket-powered aircraft which was developed in 1936 and first flew February 20, 1940, and the more recent Bereznyak-Isayev BI-1 Soviet design. Only two prototypes were built, both of which were destroyed in crashes, leading to the cancellation of the project.
==Flights==

In the early stages of World War II (1942), a complete prototype BI-1 (also known as The Devil&#x27;s Broomstick), made its first several flights. The I-270 shared the BI-1&#x27;s simple, tapered fuselage, bubble canopy, wing design, and dual-chambered bipropellant rocket motor. On the other hand, it was considerably larger than the BI-1 and featured short, reinforced wings (from the RP-218) and a raised T-tail which aircraft such as the Tupolev ANT-8 proved, offered better landing control than the BI-1&#x27;s more traditional fighter layout. While there seems little doubt that the BI-1 influenced the design of the I-270, the latter appears far from a direct descendant of the former, and much closer to being a Soviet version of the Me 263, sharing very similar fuselage, canopy and landing gear layouts, while adding a conventional stabilizer surface atop the vertical tail, absent on the German design.

The Soviet tradition of rocketry, starting from the early work of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and carried through by men like Sergei Korolev, made rocket fighters a reality. The RD-2M engine, designed by Leonid Dushkin was the dual-combustion chamber version of the engine used for the 1941 BI-1 rocket plane. That in turn had followed from a tradition dating back to Sergey Korolev&#x27;s work on project &quot;06&quot; in the early 1930s and the RP-318 rocket plane designed in 1936.

The first gliding trials commenced in December 1946, with the first prototype towed into the air behind a Tupolev Tu-2, ballast-loaded in place of an engine. The second prototype began powered tests early in 1947, but was damaged beyond repair making a hard landing. Shortly afterwards, the first prototype was also destroyed in a landing accident. By this stage, turbojet technology was at a far more advanced stage than it had been at the outset of the project, and surface-to-air missiles had replaced the need for point-defence interceptors. Under these circumstances, the Air Force decided to cancel the project.

<doc id="459900" wikidata="Q2901824" url="?curid=459900" title="Betel nut chewing">
<text>Betel nut chewing, also called betel quid chewing or areca nut chewing, is a practice in which areca nuts (also called &quot;betel nuts&quot;) are chewed together with slaked lime and betel leaves for their stimulant and narcotic effects, the primary psychoactive compound being arecoline. The practice is widespread in Southeast Asia, Micronesia, Island Melanesia, and South Asia. It is also found among both Han Chinese immigrants and indigenous peoples of Taiwan, Madagascar, and parts of southern China. It was introduced to the Caribbean in colonial times.

The preparation combining the areca nut, slaked lime, and betel (Piper betle) leaves is known as a betel quid (also called paan or &quot;pan&quot; in South Asia), but the exact composition of the mixture varies geographically. It can sometimes include other substances for flavoring and to freshen the breath, like coconut, dates, sugar, menthol, saffron, cloves, aniseed, cardamom, and many others. The areca nut can be replaced with tobacco or the two chewed together, and the betel leaves can be excluded. In West Papua, the leaf may be replaced with stem and inflorescence of the &quot;Piper betle&quot; plant. The preparation is not swallowed but is spat out after chewing. Chewing results in permanent red stains on the teeth after prolonged use. The spit from chewing betel nuts, which also results in red stains, is often regarded as unhygienic and an eyesore in public facilities in certain countries.

Betel nut chewing is addictive and causes adverse health effects, mainly oral and esophageal cancers, and cardiovascular disease. When chewed with additional tobacco in its preparation (like in gutka), there is an even higher risk, especially for oral and oropharyngeal cancers. With tobacco it also raises the risk of fatal coronary artery disease, fatal stroke, and adverse reproductive effects including stillbirth, premature birth and low birth weight.

The practice of betel nut chewing originates from Southeast Asia where the plant ingredients are native. The oldest evidence of betel nut chewing is found in a burial pit in the Duyong Cave site of the Philippines, an area where areca palms were native, dated to around 4,630±250 BP. Its diffusion is closely tied to the Neolithic expansion of the Austronesian peoples. It was spread to the Indo-Pacific during prehistoric times, reaching Micronesia at 3,500 to 3,000 BP, Near Oceania at 3,400 to 3,000 BP; South India and Sri Lanka by 3,500 BP; Mainland Southeast Asia by 3,000 to 2,500 BP; Northern India by 1500 BP; and Madagascar by 600 BP. From India it spread westwards to Persia and the Mediterranean. It was present in the Lapita culture, based on archaeological remains dated from 3,600 to 2,500 BP, but it was not carried into Polynesia.

==Culture==

One of the earliest firsthand accounts of betel nut chewing by western authors was from Ibn Battuta. He describes this practice as follows:

An early European description of betel chewing is from the Magellan Expedition to the Philippines in 1521. Antonio Pigafetta describes the practice of betel nut chewing among the natives of the Rajahnate of Butuan.

Betel quid chewing constitutes an important and popular cultural activity in many Asian and Oceanic countries, including India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Cambodia, the Solomon Islands, Thailand, the Philippines, Laos, and Vietnam. Chewing betel was once common in Malaysia, but the practice has long since died out. Betel nut kits (&quot;tepak sirih&quot;) made of silver and other precious metals, once featured in royal regalia and presented as wedding gifts, have become collectors&#x27; items, and a &quot;tepak sirih&quot; set is featured on the 1989–2012 series Malaysian 20-sen coin.

In urban areas, chewing betel quid is generally considered a nuisance because some chewers spit the betel quid juice out in public areas – compare chewing gum ban in Singapore and smoking ban. The red stain generated by the combination of ingredients when chewed are known to make a colourful stain on the ground. This is becoming an unwanted eyesore in Indian cities such as Mumbai, although many see it as an integral part of Indian culture. This is also common in some of the Persian Gulf countries, such as the UAE and Qatar, where many Indians live. Recently, the Dubai government has banned the import and sale of betel quid and the like.

According to traditional Ayurvedic medicine, chewing betel leaf is a remedy against bad breath (halitosis).

===Cambodia, Laos and Thailand===
The chewing of the product is part of the culture of Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand. Cultivation of areca nut palm and betel leaves is common in rural areas of these countries, being a traditional cash crop, and the utensils used for preparation are often treasured. Now, many young people have given up the habit, especially in urban areas, but many, especially older people, still keep to the tradition.
===Bangladesh===
In Bangladesh, &quot;paan&quot; is chewed throughout the country by all classes and is an important element of Bangladeshi culture. It is the Bengali &#x27;chewing gum&#x27;, and usually for chewing, a few slices of the betel nut are wrapped in a betel leaf, almost always with sliced areca nuts and often with calcium hydroxide (slaked lime), and may include cinnamon, clove, cardamom, catechu (khoyer), grated coconut and other spices for extra flavouring. As it is chewed, the peppery taste is savoured, along with the warm feeling and alertness it gives, similar to drinking a fresh cup of coffee.
Paan-shupari (shupari being Bengali for areca nut) is a veritable Bangladeshi archetypal imagery, employed in wide-ranging contexts. Prior to British rule, it was chewed without tobacco, and it is still rarely chewed with tobacco. Betel leaves are arranged aesthetically on a decorated plate called paandani. During the zamindari age, paan preparation and the style of garnishing it on a plate (paandani) was indeed a recognised folk art.

In Bangladesh paan is traditionally chewed not only as a habit but also as an item of rituals, etiquette and manners. On formal occasions offering paan symbolized the time for departure. In festivals and dinners, in pujas and punyas paan is an indispensable item. Hindus make use of paans as offerings in worship.

Dhakai Khilipan, a ready pack of betel leaf processed in Dhaka is famous in the sub-continent. Old Dhakaites have a rich heritage of creating the best khili paan with many complexes, colourful, aromatic and flavorful ingredients. Although &#x27;paan&#x27; has been a staple Bengali custom for ages, a number of high-end stores with premium quality paan has become available in recent times. Paan Supari is perhaps the first such brand, which offers a wide range of khili paan. They also offer a khili paan for diabetic patients called the &quot;paan afsana&quot;.

The sweet paan of the Khasi tribe is famous for its special quality. Paan is also used in Hindu puja and wedding festivals and to visit relatives. It has become a ritual, tradition and culture of Bangladeshi society. Adult women gather with paandani along with friends and relatives in leisure time.

Total cultivated area under the crop in Bangladesh is about 14,175 ha and the total annual production is about 72,500 tons. The average yield per acre is 2.27 tons. There are usually three crops during the twelve months, and they are locally called by the name of the respective months in which they are harvested. Paan leaf is usually plucked in Kartik, Phalgun and Ashad. The Kartik paan is considered by consumers to be the best and Ashad paan the worst. When plucking, it is a rule to leave at least sixteen leaves on the vine.

Different varieties of betel leaf are grown, and the quality differs in shape, bleaching quality, softness, pungency and aroma of leaf. Tamakh paan, a betel leaf blended with tobacco and spices. Supari paan, another variety of white leaf, Mitha paan, a sweet variety, and Sanchi paan are common varieties of betel leaves. Almost every paan-producing district has its own special variety of betel leaf of which consumers are well acquainted. In the past, the best quality of elegant camphor-scented betel leaf named Kafuri paan was produced in the Sonargaon area of Narayangonj district. It was exported to Calcutta and Middle Eastern countries.

The next best is the Sanchi paan grown in Chittagong hill tracts. This variety is not very popular among Bangali people. It is exported to Pakistan for the consumers of Karachi. The commoner varieties are called Desi, Bangla, Bhatial, Dhaldoga, Ghas paan. Bangla paan, is also known as Mitha paan, Jhal paan or paan of Rajshahi. At present, this variety is becoming extinct, due to emergence of more profitable and lucrative fast-growing varieties of paan crops. Normally, betel leaves are consumed with chun, seed cinnamon, cardamoms and other flavored elements.

===China===
===India===
In a 16th-century cookbook, &quot;Nimatnama-i Nasiruddin-Shahi&quot;, describes Ghiyas-ud-din Khalji, the Sultan of Mandu (r. 1469–1500), watches as tender betel leaves of the finest quality are spread out and rosewater is sprinkled on them, while saffron is also added. An elaborate betel chew or paan would contain fragrant spices and rose preserves with chopped areca nuts.

It is a tradition in South India and nearby regions to give two Betel leaves, areca nut (pieces or whole) and Coconut to the guests (both male and female) at any auspicious occasion. Even on a regular day, it is the tradition to give a married woman, who visits the house, two Betel leaves, areca nut and coconut or some fruits along with a string of threaded flowers. This is referred to as &quot;thamboolam&quot;. Paan is symbol of Prosperity in indian tradition and part of most of rituals followed.

Betel leaf used to make paan is produced in different parts of India. Some states that produce betel leaf for paan include West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh. In West Bengal, two types of betel leaves are produced. These are &quot;Bangla Patta (Country Leaf)&quot; and Mitha Patta (Sweet Leaf)&quot;. In West Bengal, &quot;Bangla patta&quot; is produced mainly in district of Dinajpur, Malda, Jalpaiguri, and Nadia. &quot;Mitha patta&quot; is produced in places such as Midnapur and South 24 Parganas.

The skilled paan maker is known as a &quot;paanwala&quot; in North India. In other parts, &quot;paanwalas&quot; are also known as &quot;panwaris&quot; or &quot;panwadis&quot;. At North India, there is a tradition to chew paan after Deepawali puja for blessings.

In the Indian state of Maharashtra, the paan culture is widely criticised due to the cleanliness problems created by people who spit in public places. In Mumbai, there have been attempts to paint pictures of Hindu gods in places where people commonly tend to spit, in the hope that this would discourage spitting, but success has been limited and there is need a solution at root to avoid peek. One of the great Marathi artists P L Deshpande wrote a comic story on the subject of &quot;paanwala&quot; (paan vendor) and performed a televised reading session on Doordarshan during the 1980s in his unique style.

Paan is losing its appeal to farmers because of falling demand. Consumers prefer chewing tobacco formulations such as gutka over paan. Higher costs, water scarcity and unpredictable weather have made betel gardens less lucrative.

According to StraitsResearch, The India pan masala market is expected to reach US$10,365 million by 2026 at the CAGR of 10.4% during the forecast period 2019–2026. The India pan masala market is driven by significant switching of consumers from tobacco products to pan masala, aggressive advertising and convenient packaging, and Maharashtra State&#x27;s revocation of the ban over pan masala products.

====Assam====
In Assam, India, betel nut is traditionally offered as a mark of respect and auspicious beginnings. &quot;Paan-tamul&quot; (betel leaves and raw areca nut) may be offered to guests after tea or meals, served in a brass plate with stands called bota. The areca nut also appears as a fertility symbol in religious and marriage ceremonies. When showing respect to elders or asking for forgiveness, people, especially newlyweds place a pair of &quot;paan-tamul&quot; on a xorai, place it in front of the &quot;elder&quot; and bow to show respect.

Guests may be invited to a wedding reception by offering a few areca nuts with betel leaves. During Bihu, the husori players are offered areca nuts and betel leaves by each household while their blessings are solicited.

&quot;Paan-tamul&quot; is also offered to guests after the end of every feast, usually the &quot;paan-tamul-soon&quot;, or slaked lime with cardamom pods in it to freshen the breath.

==== Banarasi Pan ====

&quot;Banarasi&quot; &quot;Pan&quot; of Banaras (Varanasi) is widely famous among Indians and tourists visiting India.

===Indonesia and Malaysia===

&quot;Bersirih&quot;, &quot;nyirih&quot;, or &quot;menginang&quot; is a historical Malayonesian tradition of chewing materials such as nut, betel, gambier, tobacco, clove, and limestone.

In the Malay Archipelago, the &quot;menginang&quot; or betel nut chewing has become a revered activity in local tradition; being a ceremoniously conducted gesture to honour guests. A complete and elaborate set of &quot;sirih pinang&quot; equipment is called &quot;tepak&quot;, &quot;puan&quot;, &quot;pekinangan&quot;, or &quot;cerana&quot;. The set is usually made of wooden lacquerware, brass or silverwares; and it consists of the &quot;combol&quot; (containers), &quot;bekas sirih&quot; (leaf container), &quot;kacip&quot; (press-knife to cut areca nut), &quot;gobek&quot; (small pestle and mortar), and &quot;ketur&quot; (spit container).

The &quot;Sirih Pinang&quot; has become a symbol of Malay culture, with the Malay oral tradition having phrases such as &quot;The betel opens the door to the home&quot; or &quot;the betel opens the door to the heart&quot;.

===Micronesia===
Betel nut chewing is common among the native ethnic groups of Micronesia. They can be grouped into two different traditions. The betel nut chewing tradition of the Chamorro people of the Mariana Islands prefer ripe (red) areca nuts. The betel nut chewing tradition of the Chuukese, Palauan, and Yapese people, on the other hand, prefer unripe (green) areca nuts. Betel leaf and lime are included in the quid, and commonly tobacco. Flavoring ingredients like ginger, cardamom, and vodka are also sometimes added.

Areca palms have been grown traditionally in Guam, Palau, and Yap since ancient times. It spread to Chuuk in modern times. Betel nut stains have been found in ancient remains of the Chamorro people, indicating that the practice was carried into Micronesia by their Austronesian ancestors in Island Southeast Asia.

===Myanmar===

&quot;Kwun-ya&quot; ( [kóːn.jà]) is the word for betel quid in Myanmar, formerly Burma, where the most common configuration for chewing is a betel vine leaf (&quot;Piper betel&quot;), areca nut (from &quot;Areca catechu&quot;), slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) and some spices, although many betel chewers also use tobacco.

Betel chewing has very long tradition in Burma, having been practised since before the beginning of recorded history. Until the 1960s, both men and women loved it and every household used to have a special lacquerware box for betel quid, called &quot;kun-it&quot; (), which would be offered to any visitor together with cheroots to smoke and green tea to drink. The leaves are kept inside the bottom of the box, which looks like a small hat box, but with a top tray for small tins, silver in well-to-do homes, of various other ingredients such as the betel nuts, slaked lime, cutch, anise seed and a nut cutter.

The sweet form (&quot;acho&quot;) is popular with the young, but grownups tend to prefer it with cardamom, cloves and tobacco. Spittoons, therefore, are still ubiquitous, and signs saying &quot;No betel quid-spitting&quot; are commonplace, as it makes a messy red splodge on floors and walls; many people display betel-stained teeth from the habit. Betel quid stalls and kiosks used to be run mainly by people of Indian origin in towns and cities. Smokers who want to quit would also use betel nut to wean themselves off tobacco.

Taungoo in Lower Burma is where the best areca palms are grown indicated by the popular expression &quot;like a betel lover taken to Taungoo&quot;. Other parts of the country contribute to the best betel quid according to another saying &quot;Tada-U for the leaves, Ngamyagyi for the tobacco, Taungoo for the nuts, Sagaing for the slaked lime, Pyay for the cutch&quot;. &quot;Kun, hsay, lahpet&quot; (betel quid, tobacco and pickled tea) are deemed essential items to offer monks and elders particularly in the old days. Young maidens traditionally carry ornamental betel boxes on a stand called &quot;kundaung&quot; and gilded flowers (&quot;pandaung&quot;) in a &quot;shinbyu&quot; (novitiation) procession. Burmese history also mentions an ancient custom of a condemned enemy asking for &quot;a betel quid and a drink of water&quot; before being executed.

An anecdotal government survey indicated that 40% of men and 20% of women in Myanmar chew betel. An aggregate study of cancer registries (2002 to 2007) at the Yangon and Mandalay General Hospitals, the largest hospitals in the country, found that oral cancer was the 6th most common cancer among males, and 10th among females. Of these oral carcinoma patients, 36% were regular betel quid chewers. University of Dental Medicine, Yangon records from 1985 to 1988 showed that 58.6% of oral carcinoma patients were regular betel chewers.

Since the 1990s, betel chewing has been actively discouraged by successive governments, from the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) onward, on the grounds of health and tidiness. In April 1995, the Yangon City Development Committee banned betel in Yangon (Rangoon), in anticipation of Visit Myanmar Year 1996, a massive effort to promote the country as a tourist destination. Effective 29 July 2007, betel chewing, along with smoking, has been banned from the Shwedagon Pagoda, the country&#x27;s most important religious site. In 2010, the Ministry of Education&#x27;s Department of Basic Education and Burma&#x27;s Anti-Narcotics Task Force collaborated to prohibit betel shops from operating within of any school.

===Nepal===
Paan is chewed mainly by Terai people, although migrants in Terai have also taken up chewing paan in recent times. Throughout Terai, paan is as common as anywhere in northern India. There is some local production, generally not commercial, but most leaves are imported from India. Although not as ubiquitous as in the Terai, most residents of Kathmandu occasionally enjoy paan. A sweet version of paan called &quot;meetha paan&quot; is popular amongst many who do not like the strong taste of plain (&quot;sada&quot;) paan. Some parents allow their children to consume meetha on special occasions because it is tobacco-free. 

===Pakistan===
The consumption of &quot;paan&quot; has long been a very popular cultural tradition in Pakistan, especially in the port city of Karachi, although the tradition is dying among the younger generation. In general, though, &quot;paan&quot; is an occasional delicacy thoroughly enjoyed by many, and almost exclusively bought from street vendors instead of any preparations at home. Pakistan grows a large variety of betel leaf, specifically in the coastal areas of Sindh, although &quot;paan&quot; is also imported in large quantities from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

The culture of chewing &quot;paan&quot; has also spread in Punjab, where a &quot;paan&quot; shop can be found in almost every street and market. In the famous &quot;Anarkali Bazar&quot; in Lahore a street called &quot;paan gali&quot; is dedicated for &quot;paan&quot; and other Pakistani products.

The rate of oral cancer has grown substantially in Pakistan due to chewing of &quot;paan&quot;.

===Philippines===
Betel nut chewing was formerly widespread in the indigenous ethnic groups of the Philippines. The country is where the areca palm (&quot;Areca catechu&quot;) is originally native to and where the tradition started before being spread via the Austronesian expansion (see history section). The Philippines also has the highest genetic diversity in &quot;Areca catechu&quot; populations and is home to several closely related &quot;Areca&quot; palm species, including a couple of endemic species that are used as (inferior) substitutes for &quot;Areca catechu&quot;, these are &quot;Areca caliso&quot; (known as &quot;kaliso&quot; or &quot;sakolon&quot;) and &quot;Areca ipot&quot; (known as &quot;ipot&quot; or &quot;saksik&quot;). Several varieties of &quot;Areca catechu&quot; nuts were also known in the Philippines, distinguished chiefly by the shape of the fruits.

Betel nut chewing was described as being a &quot;universal&quot; practice among older people in the early 1900s. The most common configuration of the quid combines areca nut with slaked lime (usually made from heating crushed sea-shells) and betel leaves (&quot;tambul&quot; or &quot;siri&quot;). Tobacco may or may not be added. In modern times, it has grown out of favor and has been replaced by cigarettes and chewing gum. The practice only survives among more remote ethnic groups like the Cordillerans of Luzon, and the Lumad and Moro people of Mindanao.

In the native languages of the Philippines, betel nut chewing is known variously as &quot;buyo&quot;, &quot;bunga&quot;, &quot;hitso&quot;, or &quot;ngangà&quot; in Tagalog, Bikol, and the Visayan languages; &quot;dapiau&quot; in Ivatan; and &quot;bua&quot;, &quot;mama&quot; or &quot;maman&quot; in Ilocano; &quot;luyos&quot; in Kapampangan; &quot;pasa&quot; in Basilan; and &quot;lugos&quot; in Zamboanga; among other names.

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan betel quid is sold from roadside kiosks, often by the so-called betelnut beauties although these are becoming fewer and fewer () – scantily clad girls selling a quid preparation of betel leaf, betel nuts, tobacco and lime. It is a controversial business, with critics questioning entrapment, exploitation, health, class and culture.

===Vietnam===
In Vietnam, the areca nut and the betel leaf are such important symbols of love and marriage that in Vietnamese the phrase &quot;matters of betel and areca&quot; (&quot;chuyện trầu cau&quot;) were historically synonymous with marriage. Areca nut chewing starts the talk between the groom&#x27;s parents and the bride&#x27;s parents about the young couple&#x27;s marriage. Therefore, the leaves and juices are used ceremonially in Vietnamese weddings.

==Health effects==
Chewing betel quids and areca nut causes multiple forms of cancer and cardiovascular disease, with or without tobacco.

Betel nut chewing causes an increased risk of head and neck cancers and esophageal cancer. Betel quid affects almost all parts of the human body, including the brain, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and reproductive organs. It can cause myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, liver damage, asthma, type II diabetes, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, hypothyroidism, prostate hyperplasia and infertility.

When chewed with additional tobacco in its preparation (like in gutka), there is an even higher risk for cancer, especially for oral and oropharyngeal cancers. With tobacco it also raises the risk of fatal coronary artery disease, fatal stroke and non-fatal ischaemic heart disease

Women who chew areca nut formulations, such as &quot;paan&quot;, during pregnancy significantly increase adverse outcomes for the baby. Betel quid chewing can cause stillbirth, premature birth, low birth weight.

It is estimated that around 600 million people worldwide regularly use this drug preparation. Attempts by the World Health Organization to control betel nut chewing remain problematic, as the custom is deeply rooted in many cultures, including possessing religious connotations in some parts of Southeast Asia and India. Despite being associated with adverse health outcomes, this practice is not included in the list of risk factors examined by the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD).

A recent study introduced the &quot;betel year,&quot; a novel metric designed to quantify lifetime exposure to betel quid chewing and enhance oral cancer risk prediction through personalized assessment. This tool helps identify high-risk individuals and supports targeted public health initiatives, including awareness campaigns and early detection programs. It may also inform policy development and ongoing epidemiological research. As an initial pilot effort, the betel year is a starting point, with further studies needed to explore the carcinogenic potential of other additives globally and refine the metric for wider use.

==History==
Based on archaeological, linguistic, and botanical evidence, betel chewing is most strongly associated with the Austronesian peoples. Chewing betel requires the combination of areca nut (&quot;Areca catechu&quot;) and betel leaf (&quot;Piper betle&quot;). Both plants are native from the region between Island Southeast Asia to Australasia. &quot;A. catechu&quot; is believed to be originally native to the Philippines, where it has the greatest morphological diversity as well as the most closely related endemic species. The origin of the domestication of &quot;Piper betle&quot;, however, is unknown, although it is also native to the Philippines, the Lesser Sunda Islands, and Indochina. It is also unknown when or why the two plant products were combined, as areca nut alone can be chewed as a stimulant. In eastern Indonesia, leaves from other &quot;Piper&quot; species are sometimes used in place of betel leaves.

The oldest unequivocal evidence of betel chewing is from the Philippines. Specifically that of several individuals found in a burial pit in the Duyong Cave site of Palawan island dated to around 4,630±250 BP. The dentition of the skeletons is stained, typical of betel chewers. The grave also includes &quot;Anadara&quot; shells used as containers of lime, one of which still contained lime. Burial sites in Bohol dated to the first millennium CE also show the distinctive reddish stains characteristic of betel chewing. Based on linguistic evidence of how the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian term &quot;*buaq&quot; originally meaning &quot;fruit&quot; came to refer to &quot;areca nut&quot; in Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, it is believed that betel chewing originally developed somewhere within the Philippines shortly after the beginning of the Austronesian expansion (~5,000 BP). From the Philippines, it spread back to Taiwan, as well as onwards to the rest of Austronesia.

There are very old claims of betel chewing dating to at least 13,000 BP at the Kuk Swamp site in New Guinea, based on probable &quot;Areca&quot; sp. recovered. However, it is now known that these might have been due to modern contamination of sample materials. Similar claims have also been made at other older sites with &quot;Areca&quot; sp. remains, but none can be conclusively identified as &quot;A. catechu&quot; and their association with betel peppers is tenuous or nonexistent.
It reached Micronesia at around 3,500 to 3,000 BP with the Austronesian voyagers, based on both linguistic and archaeological evidence. It was also previously present in the Lapita culture, based on archaeological remains from Mussau dated to around 3,600 to 2,500 BP. But it did not reach Polynesia further east. It is believed that it stopped in the Solomon Islands due to the replacement of betel chewing with the tradition of kava drinking prepared from the related &quot;Piper methysticum&quot;. It was also diffused into East Africa via the Austronesian settlement of Madagascar and the Comoros by around the 7th century.

The practice also diffused to the cultures the Austronesians had historical contact with. It reached the Dong Son culture via the Austronesian Sa Huỳnh culture of Vietnam at around 3,000 to 2,500 BP through trade contacts with Borneo. It is from this period that skeletons with characteristic red-stained teeth start to appear in Mainland Southeast Asia. It is assumed that it reached South China and Hainan at around the same time, though no archaeological evidence for this can be found as of yet. In Cambodia, the earliest evidence of betel nut chewing is from around 2,400 to 2,200 BP. It also spread to Thailand at 1,500 BP, based on archaeobotanical evidence.

In the Indian subcontinent, betel chewing was introduced through early contact of Austronesian traders from Sumatra, Java, and the Malay Peninsula with the Dravidian-speakers of Sri Lanka and southern India at around 3,500 BP. This also coincides with the introduction of Southeast Asian plants like &quot;Santalum album&quot; and &quot;Cocos nucifera&quot;, as well as the adoption of the Austronesian outrigger ship and crab-claw sail technologies by Dravidian-speakers. Unequivocal literary references to betel only start appearing after the Vedic period, in works like &quot;Dipavaṃsa&quot; (c. 3rd century CE) and &quot;Mahāvaṃsa&quot; (c. 5th century). Betel chewing only reached northern India and Kashmir after 500 CE through trade with Mon-Khmer-speaking peoples in the Bay of Bengal. From there it followed the Silk Road to Persia and into the Mediterranean.

Chinese records, specifically &quot;Linyi Ji&quot; by Dongfang Shuo associate the growing of areca palms with the first settlers of the Austronesian Champa polities in southern Vietnam at around 2,100 to 1,900 BP. This association is echoed in &quot;Nanfang Cao Mu Zhuang&quot; by Ji Han (c. 304 CE) who also describes its importance in Champa culture, specifically in the way Cham hosts traditionally offer it to guests. Betel chewing entered China through trade with Champa, borrowing the Proto-Malayo-Chamic name &quot;*pinaŋ&quot; resulting in Chinese &quot;bin lang&quot; for &quot;areca nut&quot;, with the meaning of &quot;honored guest&quot;, reflecting Chamic traditions. The same for the alternate term &quot;bin men yao jian&quot;, literally meaning &quot;guest [at the door] medicinal sweetmeat&quot;.

<text>was a town located in Shimoge District, Ōita Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 5,215 and the density of 28.39 persons per km2. The total area was 183.70 km2.

On March 1, 2005, Yabakei, along with the towns of Hon&#x27;yabakei and Yamakuni, and the village of Sankō (all from Shimoge District), was merged into the expanded city of Nakatsu.

An area of lush forests and mountains, Yabakei was known for its beautiful autumn leaves. It also was home to the Aonodōmon, a legendary tunnel said to have been dug through solid rock by a single man over 30 years, and Rakanji, a famous mountain temple.

<text>was a town located in Shimoge District, Ōita Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 3,317 and the density of 27.68 persons per km2. The total area was 119.85 km2.

On March 1, 2005 Yamakuni, along with the towns of Hon&#x27;yabakei and Yabakei, and the village of Sankō (all from Shimoge District), was merged into the expanded city of Nakatsu.

Yamakuni is best known for Core Yamakuni (（コアやまくに), a large municipal building featuring an ice-skating rink in the winter. It has a junior high school, Yamakuni Chugakko (山国中学校), and an elementary school, Misato Shogakko (三郷小学校). As part of its fusion with Nakatsu City, two elementary schools, Tsukinoki (槻木) and Mizobe (溝部), were closed and their students transferred to Misato in 2005.

Despite the former town&#x27;s political ties to Nakatsu City, it is geographically closer to Hita City to its west. It also tends to look to bordering Fukuoka Prefecture more than to the distant prefectural capital of Oita City.

Yamakuni is notable for its contribution to Japanese mythology in the form of the Yamaguni Yetii myth. This tale, widely regarded as fictional, recounts the story of a local hunter who allegedly stalked, captured and skinned the famous Yetii, and mounted its hide above his hearth. The tale is recalled in many local folk songs, poems and word-of-mouth folklore.

<text>Viscount Torrington is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. 

==History==
The Peerage was created in 1721 for the statesman Sir George Byng, 1st Baronet, along with the subsidiary title Baron Byng, of Southill in the County of Bedford, also in the Peerage of Great Britain. He had already been created a baronet, of Wrotham in the County of Kent, in the Baronetage of Great Britain in 1715. His eldest son, the second Viscount, represented Plymouth and Bedfordshire in the House of Commons and later served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1746 to 1747. His younger brother, the third Viscount, was a major-general in the Army. His grandson, the sixth Viscount, was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy. His son, the seventh Viscount, served as Governor of Ceylon between 1847 and 1850.

On his death the titles passed to his nephew, the eighth Viscount, the son of Honourable Robert Barlow Palmer Byng, third son of the sixth Viscount. He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Viscount. However, this line of the family failed on his death in 1944 and the titles passed to the late Viscount&#x27;s first cousin, the tenth Viscount. As of 2013 the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the eleventh Viscount, who succeeded on his grandfather&#x27;s death in 1961.

Several other members of the Byng family have also gained distinction. The Hon. Robert Byng, third son of the first Viscount, was Member of Parliament for Plymouth. He was the father of George Byng, radical Member of Parliament for Middlesex. He was the father of George Byng, Father of the House of Commons, and John Byng, 1st Earl of Strafford. The soldier Julian Hedworth George Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy, was the youngest son of the second Earl of Strafford.

Admiral the Hon. John Byng, who was controversially court-martialled and shot in 1757, was the fourth son of the first Viscount Torrington. He was the only British admiral ever executed after a court-martial.

The family seat is Great Hunts Place, near Winchester, Hampshire. The traditional burial place of the Viscounts Torrington is the Byng Vault at the Church of All Saints, Southill, Bedfordshire.

Other notable members of the family were Captain Launcelot Alfred Cranmer-Byng (1872-1945), sinologist and translator of ancient Chinese poetry, and his brother, author and playwright Hugh Edward Cranmer-Byng (1873–1949).

<doc id="459908" wikidata="Q748040" url="?curid=459908" title="Mount Hiei">
<text>is a mountain to the northeast of Kyoto, lying on the border between the Kyoto and Shiga Prefectures, Japan.

The temple of Enryaku-ji, the first outpost of the Japanese Tendai (Chin. Tiantai) sect of Buddhism, was founded atop Mount Hiei by Saichō in 788 and rapidly grew into a sprawling complex of temples and buildings that were roughly divided into three areas:
# The area near the summit, and technically in Kyoto Prefecture.
# The area, also near the summit, where Enryaku-ji Temple was first founded, and located just within Shiga Prefecture.
# The area near the northernmost end of Mount Hiei. Due to its remoteness, as a temple complex it experienced periods of revival and decline, starting with Ennin, later revived by Ryōgen and made famous by the scholar-monk Genshin.

Due to its position north-east of the ancient capital of Kyoto, it was thought in ancient geomancy practices to be a protective bulwark against negative influences on the capital, which along with the rise of the Tendai sect in Heian period Japan (8th - 12th centuries) meant that the mountain and the temple complex were politically powerful and influential. Later schools of Buddhism in Japan were almost entirely founded by ex-monks of the Tendai sect, such as Hōnen, Nichiren, Dōgen and Shinran, who all studied at the temple before leaving Mount Hiei to start their own practices. 

The temple complex was razed by Oda Nobunaga in 1571 to quell the rising power of Tendai&#x27;s warrior monks (sōhei), but it was rebuilt and remains the Tendai headquarters to this day.

The 19th-century Japanese ironclad &quot;Hiei&quot; was named after this mountain, as was the more famous World War II-era battleship , the latter having initially been built as a battlecruiser.

==Mount Hiei in folklore==

Mount Hiei has been featured in many folk tales over the ages. Originally it was thought to be the home of gods and demons of Shinto lore, although it is predominantly known for the Buddhist monks that come from the temple of Enryaku-ji.

==Marathon monks==
John Stevens wrote the book &quot;The Marathon Monks of Mount Hiei,&quot; chronicling the practice of walking long distances – up to a day for 100 straight days, in an effort to attain enlightenment. The practice of walking is known as the &quot;kaihōgyō&quot;.

A 2010 US National Public Radio report described the &quot;sennichi kaihōgyō&quot; (thousand-day &quot;kaihōgyō&quot;) as 
==Attractions==

Beyond the mountain itself, its forests, and the views it affords – of Kyoto, of Ohara, of lake Biwa and Shiga – the main attraction is the temple complex of Enryaku-ji. The temple complex spreads out over the mountain, but is concentrated in three areas, connected by foot trails. There are also more minor temples and shrines.

Unusually, there are also a number of French-themed attractions – the peak itself features the Garden Museum Hiei, which is themed on French impressionism, featuring gardens and French paintings, while there is also a French-themed hotel, &quot;L&#x27;hotel de Hiei&quot; (The Hiei Hotel). The mountain is busiest during the daytime, but has some visitors in the evenings, for light-up displays and to see the night view of the surrounding towns.

==Access==
The mountain is a popular area for hikers and a toll road provides access by automobile to the top of the mountain; there are also buses that connect the mountaintop to town a few times a day. There are also two routes of funiculars: the Eizan Cable from the Kyoto side to the connecting point with an aerial tramway (&quot;ropeway&quot;) to the top, and the Sakamoto Cable from the Shiga side to the foot of Enryaku-ji.

The attractions on the mountain are quite spread out, so there are regular buses during the daytime connecting the attractions. The center for these is the bus center, in front of the entrance to the main temple complex at .

<doc id="459910" wikidata="Q1264766" url="?curid=459910" title="Misha Mengelberg">
<text>Misha Mengelberg (5 June 1935 – 3 March 2017) was a Dutch jazz pianist and composer. A prominent figure in post-WWII European Jazz, Mengelberg is known for his forays into free improvisation, for bringing humor into his music, and as a leading interpreter of songs by fellow pianists Thelonious Monk and Herbie Nichols.

==Biography==
Mengelberg was born in Kiev, Ukrainian SSR, the son of the Dutch conductor (1902-1984) and grand-nephew of conductor Willem Mengelberg. Karel Mengelberg was a Dutch composer and conductor, who worked in Berlin, Barcelona, Kiev and Amsterdam. A notable work of his was &#x27;Catalunya Renaixent&#x27;, written for the Banda Municipal of Barcelona in 1934.

Misha&#x27;s family moved back to the Netherlands in the late 1930s and he began learning the piano at age five. He was considered a chess marvel at age nine. He would continue to compete in chess championships in the 1970s despite his musical career. Mengelberg briefly studied architecture before entering the Royal Conservatory in The Hague, where he studied music from 1958 to 1964. While there he won the first prize at a jazz festival in Loosdrecht and became associated with Fluxus. His early influences included Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington and John Cage, whom he heard lecture at Darmstadt.

Mengelberg won the Gaudeamus International Composers Award in 1961. Among his first recordings was one of Eric Dolphy&#x27;s last, &quot;Last Date&quot; (1964). Also on that record was the drummer Han Bennink, and the two of them, together with saxophonist Piet Noordijk, formed a quartet which had a number of different bassists, and which played at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1966. In 1967 he co-founded the Instant Composers Pool, an organisation which promoted avant garde Dutch jazz performances and recordings, with Bennink and Willem Breuker. He was co-founder of STEIM in Amsterdam in 1969.

Mengelberg played with a large variety of musicians. He often performed in a duo with fellow Dutchman Bennink, with other collaborators including Derek Bailey, Peter Brötzmann, Evan Parker, Anthony Braxton, and (on the flip side of a live recording with Dolphy) his pet parrot. He was also one of the earliest exponents of the work of the once-neglected pianist Herbie Nichols.

He also wrote music for others to perform (generally leaving some room for improvisation) and oversaw a number of music theatre productions, which usually included a large element of absurdist humour. A 2006 DVD release, &quot;Afijn&quot; (ICP/Data), is a primer on Mengelberg&#x27;s life and work, containing an 80-minute documentary and additional concert footage.

Mengelberg died in Amsterdam on 3 March 2017, aged 81, from undisclosed causes.
