<text>Bamford is a village in the Peak District, Derbyshire, England, close to the River Derwent. To the north-east is Bamford Edge, and to the north-west the Ladybower, Derwent and Howden Reservoirs. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 1,241.

==History==
Its name is recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Banford&quot;, and likely came from Anglo-Saxon &quot;Bēamford&quot; = &quot;tree-trunk ford&quot;.

The parish church of St John the Baptist was built c. 1860. There is also the Bamford Methodist Church and Catholic churches in the village, most notable of which is Our Lady of Sorrows Church.

The village graveyard also contains some re-interred graves from the nearby villages of Derwent and Ashopton which were submerged following the creation of Ladybower Reservoir.

Bamford watermill has been turned into flats but some of the original machinery still remains.

==Recreation==
The village has a sculpture trail and, in mid-July, there is a well dressing festival. Bamford has four public houses, the Derwent Hotel (now a self-catering venue), the Anglers Rest, the Ladybower Inn and the Yorkshire Bridge Inn, the latter once home to former &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter Peter Purves. The village also had a weekly Youth Club held in the Memorial Hall until September 2010.

In October 2013 The Anglers Rest was jointly purchased from the pub chain owners Admiral Taverns by over 300 people from the local area as Derbyshire&#x27;s first community-owned pub. The Bamford Community Society raised the money needed to buy the Angler&#x27;s, which will be run as a community hub, listed as an Asset of Community Value under the Government&#x27;s Localism Act, which also offers a daytime café and houses the local post office.

Nearby Hope Valley College offers Yoga classes at Bamford Village Institute as part of its adult education programme.

===Carnival===

Until recently, Bamford hosted a village carnival, normally on the third week of July. The carnival took place throughout the week, with the Committee arranging various events for each day, including the whole family. The carnival was centred on the well dressing.
The blessing of the well took place on the Sunday and was followed by the crowning of the Queen, Princess and Rosebud in the church. The following Wednesday hosts the Senior fell race which many runners attend, including running groups from Yorkshire. Other events included the junior fell race, teen group challenge, car treasure hunt, pet show, village history fair and pub quiz.
The Saturday hosted the actual carnival day. The procession travelled from &quot;the old road&quot; and paraded through the village, ending at the recreation ground, where games and entertainment for the whole family were arranged. 
The carnival parade encouraged children to dress up and floats to be made, fitting with the theme of the year. Two bands took part in the procession: Castleton Brass Band was invited every year, along with a visiting band randomly selected each year. There is also a tradition of making a scarecrow and dressing it up and leaving it in your front garden to be admired during the carnival.

==Transport==
The village is served by Bamford railway station on the Hope Valley line and by regular bus service 257 to Sheffield and Bakewell.

Bamford is known as the Gateway to the Hope Valley from Manchester and the north-west as it provides the only road through to the Hope Valley from the A57 Glossop–Sheffield road over the Snake Pass.

==Media==
Regional TV news comes from Leeds-based BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Shatton Edge relay transmitter. The village is served by both BBC Radio Derby and BBC Radio Sheffield. Another radio station that broadcasts to Bamford is Greatest Hits Radio Derbyshire (High Peak) (formerly High Peak Radio). Bamford&#x27;s local newspaper is the &quot;Derbyshire Times&quot;.

==Bamford Mill==

As for so many Peak District villages, it developed around its mill, which existed here before the Industrial Revolution. From 1782, a water powered corn mill was built here by a local farmer and miller, Christopher Kirk. This only lasted a few years until destroyed by fire in 1791. It was rebuilt as a cotton mill, still powered by water. In the early 19th century it converted to steam power, with a beam engine. A more modern horizontal cross-compound mill engine with a rope drive, &quot;Edna&quot;, by Musgrave was installed in 1907, and remains on site today. Water power was still used for generating electricity for this isolated mill, with two reaction turbines of and . Until 1951 the mill also maintained its own gasworks. More electricity generating capacity was provided by a DC generator driven by a De Laval impulse turbine and reduction gearbox, built by Greenwood &amp; Batley.

In 1857, the mill was owned by S. M. Moore and Son and employed 230 mill hands. It was sold in 1885 to Hamilton Cash of Mansfield, then in 1902 to the Fine Cotton Spinners and Doublers Association. The work at this mill was the doubling of cotton yarn which had already been carded and spun in Lancashire mills. This employed 130 hands. In 1963 FS&amp;D became part of Courtaulds, who closed the mill in 1965. Afterwards the mill building was bought by Carbolite, who manufactured electric kilns and laboratory furnaces.
The mill closed permanently in the 1990s and the building was later converted to flats. The chimney was demolished and the boiler plant and turbines removed. The mill engine was preserved on site and remains there today, but is not operational. Every year locals gather to celebrate the mill and how it brought life to the village.

==Surroundings==
Further up the valley are the Ladybower, Derwent and Howden dams.

Nearby are the villages of Shatton, Bradwell (well known for its ice cream), Hope, Hathersage (well known for its open air swimming pool), Eyam and Castleton, famous for its Blue John stone. A place of notable significance near Bamford would be Buxton.

The nearest urban centre is Sheffield and is a very popular place to visit for the youth of Bamford and well as Chesterfield which is where many students go for higher education.

Film of Bamford in 1945 is held by the Cinema Museum in London. Ref HM0365

<doc id="461990" wikidata="Q4114990" url="?curid=461990" title="Education in Malaysia">
<text>Education in Malaysia is overseen by the Ministry of Education (). Although education is the responsibility of the Federal Government, each state and federal territory has an Education Department to co-ordinate educational matters in its territory. The main legislation governing education is the Education Act 1996.

Education spending usually makes up about 14 per cent of the annual national budget, the biggest allocation among all. The education system in Malaysia is divided into five stages: preschool education, primary education, secondary education, post-secondary education and tertiary education. It is further divided into national and private education. Education may be obtained from the multilingual national school system, which provides free education for all Malaysians, or private schools, or through homeschooling. International and private institutions charge school fees. By law, primary education is compulsory. Secondary education is expected to be compulsory. Standardised tests are a common feature as in many Asia-Pacific countries such as the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Japan. Currently, there are 20 public universities, 54 private universities, 39 private university colleges, 10 foreign university branch campuses, 331 private colleges, 36 polytechnics and 105 community college in Malaysia.

==History==


===Origins===
 (literally, &quot;hut school&quot;), madrasah and other Islamic schools were the earliest forms of schooling available in Malaysia. Early works of Malay literature such as &quot;Hikayat Abdullah&quot; mention these schools indicating they pre-date the current secular model of education. Some madrasah came under the control of state religious council, which continue to this day.

===British colonial period===
Many of the earliest schools in Malaysia were founded in the Straits Settlements of Penang, Malacca, and Singapore. The oldest English-language school in Malaya is the Penang Free School, founded in 1816, followed by Malacca High School, St. Xavier&#x27;s Institution, King Edward VII School (Taiping) and Anglo Chinese School, Klang. Many traditionally English-language schools are considered quite prestigious.

British historian Richard O. Winstedt worked to improve the education of the Malays and was instrumental in establishing Sultan Idris Training College with the purpose of producing Malay teachers. Richard James Wilkinson helped established the Malay College Kuala Kangsar in 1905 which aimed to educate the Malay elite.

Initially, the British colonial government did not provide for any Malay-language secondary schools, forcing those who had studied in Malay during primary school to adjust to an English-language education should they have the opportunity to commence secondary education. Colonial reports affirmed that the limits of Malay to only primary level education are intended merely &quot;to make the son of the fisherman or peasant a more intelligent fisherman or peasant than his father had been&quot;. Many Malays failed to pursue additional education due to this issue; even Sultan Idris Shah I of Perak criticised the intended effect of this policy&#x27;s design as such during the 1903 Conference of Rulers. Despite these high-profile criticisms, the British Director of Education stated:

Malay representatives in the Federal Council as well as the Legislative Council of Singapore responded vehemently, with one calling the British policy &quot;a policy that trains the Malay boy how not to get employment&quot; by excluding the Malays from learning in the &quot;bread-earning language of Malaya&quot;. He remarked:

To remedy this problem, the British established the Malay College Kuala Kangsar. However, it was mainly intended as a way to educate low-level civil servants and not as a means to opening the doors of commerce to the Malays – the school was never intended to prepare students for entrance to higher institutions of education.

===Decolonisation and independence===
In the 1950s, there had been four initial proposals for developing the national education system: the Barnes Report (favoured by the Malays), Ordinance Report (modification of the Barnes Report), the Fenn-Wu Report (favoured by the Chinese and Indians), and the Razak Report (a compromise between the two reports). The Barnes proposal was implemented through the 1952 Education Ordinance amidst Chinese protests. In 1956, the Razak Report was adopted by the Malayan government as the education framework for independent Malaya. The Razak Report called for a national school system consisting of Malay, English, Chinese and Tamil-medium schools at the primary level, and Malay and English-medium schools at the secondary schools, with a uniform national curriculum regardless of the medium of instruction. Malay-medium schools would be known as &quot;national&quot;, while other languages schools would be known as &quot;national-type&quot;.

In the early years following the 1957 Malaysian Independence Act, existing Chinese, Tamil and mission schools accepted government funding and were allowed to retain their medium of instructions on the condition that they adopt the national curriculum. Chinese secondary schools were given the options of accepting government funding and change into English national-type schools or remain Chinese and private without government funding. Most of the schools accepted the change, although a few rejected the offer and came to be known as Chinese independent high schools. Shortly after the change, some of the national-type schools reestablished their Chinese independent high school branches. All remaining nationalised schools underwent a gradual implementation of Malay as the main medium of education in the 1970s, though English remained a compulsory subject in their syllabus.

In 1996, the Education Act of 1996 was passed to amend the Education Ordinance of 1956 and the Education Act of 1961. In 2004, the Ministry of Education was split into two: the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education. The latter handles matters regarding tertiary education. After a brief merging of the two departments in 2013, they again split in 2015. After the 2018 general election, the ministry became a higher education division under the MOE. In the Muhyiddin cabinet, the higher education division was separated again from the Ministry of Education to form as a new ministry since 10 March 2020. It is split as of 2023.

In late December 2021, the Kuala Lumpur High Court ruled that Chinese and Tamil vernacular schools were consistent with Articles 152 (1) (a) and (b) of the Malaysian Constitution, rejecting a lawsuit by three NGOs – Gabungan Pelajar Melayu Semenanjung (GPMS), the Islam Education Development Council (Mappim) and the Confederation of Malaysian Writers Association (Gapena) – seeking to ban vernacular schools on the grounds they were inconsistent with the Malaysian Constitution. The High Court&#x27;s ruling was welcomed by Malaysian Chinese Association secretary-general Datuk Chong Sin Woon, Deputy Education Minister and Malaysian Indian Congress member Datuk P. Kamalanathan, and Democratic Action Party assemblyman Ronnie Liu. However, the NGOs now want the Federal Court to decide on vernacular schools’ constitutionality after the lower courts judgement.

===Private missionary schools===

During the British colonial period, missionaries of Christian denominations, such as the Roman Catholic religious orders – particularly the Lasallian Brothers and the Sisters of the Holy Infant Jesus – Seventh-day Adventists, Anglicans, and Methodists, established a series of &quot;private missionary schools&quot; which provided primary and secondary education in the English language. Almost all of these were single-sex schools. These schools were fee-paying and some had boarding schools attached to them. They were seen as &quot;providing the best education&quot; as they used &quot;English as their medium of instruction&quot;. Although nowadays these missionary schools have fully assimilated into the Malay-medium national school system and most admit students regardless of gender and background, many of the schools remain single-sex and still bear their original names, such as the ones with the names of saints or words such as &quot;Catholic&quot;, &quot;Convent&quot;, &quot;Advent&quot; and &quot;Methodist&quot;.

By the 1960s, the government no longer charged fees at primary schools with a Malay-language medium; fees for Malay-medium primary schools were abolished by the Education Act of 1961 and &quot;abolished with affect&quot; by 1966. The missionary schools providing a curriculum in the English-language medium continued to charge fees which were &quot;regulated by the government&quot;. By the 1980s, missionary schools were offering a curriculum – primary and secondary – in the Malay-language medium and thus no longer required to charge fees. However, donations from these school&#x27;s alumni and their families are still paid today.

During the 1970s, in accordance to the national language policy, the government began to change these English-medium primary and secondary national-type schools – missionary schools – into Malay-medium national schools. The language change was made gradually starting from the first year in primary school, then the second year in the following year and so on. The change was completed by the end of 1982.

At this period, the &quot;mission school authorities baulked&quot; at the government&#x27;s request that they &quot;surrender&quot; their schools – land and buildings – to the government to be converted into fully aided national schools. Today, the various religious denominations still retain ownership of the &quot;land and school buildings&quot; of their missionary schools with the schools themselves operating as &quot;only grant-in-aid national schools&quot;. They are not &quot;fully aided&quot; government schools. The church groups receive a &quot;token monthly rent&quot; from the government. The closure of a missionary school results in the &quot;plots of land&quot; being returned by the Education Ministry to their &quot;owners&quot; – the religious groups.

In 2017, a number of &quot;mission school educationists&quot; had reportedly re-established their schools as &quot;private with a local curriculum&quot; stating that the schools had &quot;long histories as private mission schools&quot;. The report stated that &quot;St John’s International School is now a private-funded education centre in collaboration with the La Salle Brothers Malaysia. It has links with the Lasallian organisation which has had a footing in Malaysia since 1904, with premier St. John&#x27;s Institution as a mission school, and also in more than 70 countries&quot;. The Sisters of the Holy Infant Jesus are also considering such re-structuring for their schools saying that they have &quot;no intention to sell their land and buildings for redevelopment&quot;.

==School grades==

===Public and private schools following the National Curriculum===

The school year is divided into two semesters. The first semester begins in early January and ends in late May; the second semester begins in early June and ends in November.

===Chinese Independent High Schools===

After completing their primary education in a Chinese national-type primary school, some students may choose to attend a Chinese Independent High School for their secondary education. Education in Chinese Independent High Schools usually last for six years, divided into two stages: three years in junior middle and three years in senior middle, similar to the secondary school systems in mainland China and Taiwan. Students are streamed into tracks like Science or Art/Commerce in the senior middle stage. At the end of each stage, students sit for the Unified Examination Certificate (UEC). A few schools offer an additional year in senior middle, catering to students taking the government&#x27;s Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia (STPM, equivalent to A-level). Chinese independent high schools use the same academic year as government schools. An academic year consists of two semesters: Semester 1 from January to May and Semester 2 from June to November, with examinations at the end of each semester. The overall academic performance of a student in an academic year determines his/her promotion to the next study year in the next academic year. Failing requires repeating the study year. Usually, failing to be promoted for two years in a row results in a dismissal. In contrast, students in government schools are automatically promoted regardless of academic performance.
===International schools following international curriculums===

There are many students who attend international schools in Malaysia. Typically, students either are enrolled in international schools from either Year 7 onwards, as the public education system for secondary school students is entirely in Bahasa Malaysia, whereas most universities and colleges conduct their lectures in the English language. Many of these parents also wish for their children to pursue an international education in the future, and entering an English-medium environment enables students to be prepared for that. International schools in Malaysia follow various curriculums, such as the Cambridge International Curriculum (UK), Australian curriculum (Western Australia), Canadian curriculum (Ontario) and the IB Curriculum (Switzerland). Many students from international schools enter university at the age of 17 due to the age arrangements. 
== Dual Language Program (DLP) ==
The Dual Language Program (DLP) is an educational initiative implemented by the Ministry of Education under the broader Policy of Enhancing the Malaysian Language and Strengthening the English Language (MBMMBI). Launched on a pilot basis in 2016 and initially involving 300 schools, the DLP offers eligible educational institutions the option to conduct teaching and learning sessions in English for specific subjects, notably Science and Mathematics, at the primary and secondary school levels.

The primary objectives of the DLP are threefold: first, to provide opportunities for students to enhance their English proficiency through the instruction of Science and Mathematics subjects; second, to expand students&#x27; access to explore various fields of knowledge, fostering competitiveness at the global level; and third, to increase the marketability of students in the workforce. The program is strategically designed to strengthen bilingualism among students, ultimately preparing them for the challenges of an increasingly interconnected and competitive world.

At the primary school level, the DLP encompasses Science and Mathematics, while at the lower secondary and upper secondary levels, it extends to additional subjects such as Additional Science, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Additional Mathematics, and Mathematics. By offering English language instruction in key STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines, the DLP aims to equip students with the language skills necessary for success in both academic and professional domains.

=== Issues and Developments ===
Despite its strategic goals, the Dual Language Program (DLP) in Malaysia has encountered several challenges and witnessed significant developments since its inception in 2016. One notable concern has been the proficiency of students in Bahasa Melayu (BM), the national language, and their mother tongues. Field visits by the Ministry of Education revealed instances where students in DLP schools lacked a basic level of proficiency in these languages, prompting the ministry to emphasise the need for schools to ensure that all criteria, including BM mastery, are met.

Controversies have also arisen over the stringent criteria for DLP implementation. Stakeholders, including parents and school officials, have voiced concerns about the impact of these criteria, such as the recent requirement for a minimum of one full non-DLP class in schools implementing the full DLP. This has led to challenges in resource allocation and sparked debates about the practicality of such conditions, especially for schools with limited resources. Few of the schools in Malacca opposed on the forced implementation of non-DLP class, which these schools taught mathematics and science subjects fully in English language.

At the end of 2023, there were 2,420 DLP schools in Malaysia, comprising 1,613 primary schools and 807 secondary schools. In an effort to address concerns and ensure a case-by-case approach, the Ministry of Education has allowed schools to open more than one DLP class for Year One and Form One students based on readiness and assessment by relevant education offices.

== Preschool education ==
There is no fixed rules on when a child needs to start preschool education but majority would start when the child turns 3 years old. Schooling can begin earlier, from 3–6, in kindergarten. Preschool education usually lasts for 2 years, before they proceed to primary school at age 7. There is no formal preschool curriculum except a formal mandatory training and certification for principals and teachers before they may operate a preschool. The training covers lessons on child psychology, teaching methodologies, and other related curricula on childcare and development. Preschool education is not compulsory.

Preschool education is mainly provided by private for-profit preschools, though some are run by the government or religious groups. Some primary schools have attached preschool sections. Attendance in a preschool programme is not universal; while people living in urban areas are generally able to send their children to private kindergartens, few do in rural areas. Registered preschools are subjected to zoning regulations and must comply to other regulations such as health screening, fire hazard assessment and educational guidelines. Many preschools are located in high density residential areas, where normal residential units compliant to regulations are converted into the schools.

==Primary education==
Primary education in Malaysia begins at age seven and lasts for six years, referred to as Year (&quot;Tahun&quot;) 1 to 6 (also known as Standard (&quot;Darjah&quot;) 1 to 6). Year 1 to Year 3 are classified as Level One (&quot;Tahap Satu&quot;) while Year 4 to Year 6 are considered as Level Two (&quot;Tahap Dua&quot;). Students are promoted to the next year regardless of their academic performance.

From 1996 until 2000, the &quot;Penilaian Tahap Satu&quot; (PTS) or the Level One Evaluation was administered to Year 3 students. Excellence in this test allowed students to skip Year 4 and attend Year 5 instead. However, the test was removed from 2001 onwards due to concerns that parents and teachers were unduly pressuring students to pass the exam.

Before progressing to secondary education, Year 6 pupils used to sit for the Primary School Achievement Test (&quot;Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah&quot;, UPSR). The subjects tested were Malay comprehension, Malay writing, English comprehension, English writing, Science and Mathematics. In addition to the six subjects, Chinese comprehension(华文理解) and written Chinese(华文作文) were compulsory in Chinese schools(SJKC), while Tamil comprehension (தமிழ் கருத்துணர்தல்) and written Tamil (தமிழ் கட்டுரை) were compulsory in Tamil schools (SJKT). In 2021, the Ministry of Education cancelled the Primary School Achievement Test (Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah) for all Year 6 students. Then in 2022, the Ministry of Education decided that Year 4 to 6 students participate in the new UASA (Ujian Akhir Sesi Akademik) test. The subjects tested are : Malay, English, Science, Maths. Chinese (华文) is compulsory in Chinese schools (SJKC), while Tamil (தமிழ்) is compulsory in Tamil schools (SJKT).

Schools in Malaysia can select other subjects to be tested, but it had to be prepared by the school. For example: Reka Bentuk dan Teknologi (Robotics and Technology), Pendidikan Moral (Moral Education), Pendidikan Islam (Islamic Education), Pendidikan Seni Visual (Arts) (Year 5,6), Pendidikan Muzik (Music) (Year 5,6), Pendidikan Kesenian (Arts and Music) (Year 4) and Pendidikan Jasmani dan Pendidikan Kesihatan (P.E. and Health Education).

===School types and medium of instruction===
Public primary schools are divided into two categories based on the medium of instruction:
* Malay-medium National Schools (&quot;Sekolah Kebangsaan&quot;, SK)
* non-Malay-medium National-type Schools (&quot;Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan&quot;, SJK), also known as &quot;vernacular schools&quot;, further divided into
**National-type School (Chinese) (&quot;Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (Cina)&quot;, SJK(C)), Mandarin-medium and simplified Chinese writing
**National-type School (Tamil) (&quot;Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (Tamil)&quot;, SJK (T)), Tamil-medium

All schools admit students regardless of racial and language background.

Malay and English are compulsory subjects in all schools. All schools use the same syllabus for non-language subjects regardless of the medium of instruction. The teaching of the Chinese language is compulsory in SJK(C), and Tamil language is compulsory in SJK(T). Additionally, a National School must provide the teaching of Chinese or Tamil language, as well as indigenous languages wherever practical, if the parents of at least 15 pupils in the school request that the particular language be taught.

In January 2003, a mixed medium of instruction was introduced so that students would learn Science and Mathematics in English. Due to pressure from the Chinese community, SJK(C) teach Science and Mathematics in both English and Chinese. Later, the government reversed the policy of teaching Science and Mathematics in English in July 2009, and previous languages of instruction will be reintroduced in stages from 2012. However, the Ministry has since launched the Dual Language Program (DLP) to cater the language issue.

By degree of government funding, National Schools are government-owned and operated, while National-type Schools are mostly government-aided, though some are government-owned. In government-aided National-type Schools, the government is responsible for funding the school operations, teachers&#x27; training and salary, and setting the school curriculum, while the school buildings and assets belong to the local ethnic communities, which elect a board of directors for each school to safeguard the school properties. Between 1995 and 2000, the Seventh Malaysia Plan allocation for primary education development allocated 96.5% to National Schools which had 75% of total enrolment. Chinese National-type Schools (21% enrolment) received 2.4% of the allocation while Tamil National-type Schools (3.6% enrolment) received 1% of the allocation. 

Previously, there were also other types of National-type Schools. The English National-type Schools were assimilated to become National Schools as a result of decolonisation. Others, such as those for Telugu and Punjabi were closed due to the dwindling number of students and assimilation to Tamil dominance. The role of promoting these two languages and culture are currently fulfilled by some Gurdwaras (Sikh temples) and Telugu based organisations.

The division of public education at the primary level into National and National-type Schools has been criticised for allegedly creating racial polarisation at an early age. To address the problem, attempts have been made to establish &quot;Sekolah Wawasan&quot; (&quot;vision schools&quot;). Under the concept, three schools (typically one SK, one SJK(C) and one SJK(T)) would share the same school compound and facilities while maintaining different school administrations, ostensibly to encourage closer interaction. However, this was met with objections from most of the Chinese and Indian communities as they believe this will restrict the use of their mother tongue in schools.

==Secondary education==

Public secondary education in Malaysia is provided by National Secondary Schools (&quot;Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan&quot;, &quot;SMK&quot;). National Secondary Schools use Malay as the main medium of instruction because Malay language is the National language of Malaysia while English is a compulsory subject in all schools. Since 2003, Science and Mathematics had been taught in English, however in 2009 the government decided to revert to use Malay starting in year 2012. However, the Ministry has since launched the Dual Language Program (DLP) to cater the language issue.

As in primary schools, a National Secondary School must provide teaching of Chinese and Tamil languages, as well as indigenous languages wherever practical, on request of parents of at least 15 pupils in the school. In addition, foreign languages such as Arabic or Japanese may be taught at certain schools.

Secondary education lasts for five years, referred to as Form (&quot;Tingkatan&quot;) 1 to 5. Form 1 to Form 3 are known as Lower Form (&quot;Menengah Rendah&quot;), while Form 4 and 5 are known as Upper Form (&quot;Menengah Atas&quot;). Most students who had completed primary education are admitted to Form 1. Students from national-type primary schools have the additional requirement to obtain a minimum D grade for the Malay subjects at the end of Primary school, failing which they will have to attend a year-long transition class, commonly called &quot;Remove&quot; (&quot;Kelas/Tingkatan Peralihan&quot;), before proceeding to Form 1. As in primary schools, students are promoted to the next year regardless of their academic performance.

Co-curricular activities are compulsory at the secondary level, where all students must participate in at least 2 activities for most states, and 3 activities for the Sarawak region. There are many co-curricular activities offered at the secondary level, varying at each school and each student is judged based in these areas. Competitions and performances are regularly organised. Co-curricular activities are often categorised under the following: Uniformed Groups, Performing Arts, Clubs &amp; Societies, Sports &amp; Games. Student may also participate in more than 2 co-curricular activities.

Before progressing to Upper Form, Form 3 students are required to sit for their final exam — Ujian Akhir Sesi Akademik Tingkatan 3 (UASA). Their result, performance and interest will determine the streams they will get during Upper Form. Other than that, student performance is also determined by Pentaksiran Berasaskan Sekolah (PBS), the school-based assessment. Previously, the &quot;Pentaksiran Tingkatan 3&quot; (PT3) or Form Three Assessment was taken by students until the government abolished the exam in 2022.

At the end of Form 5, students are required to take the &quot;Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia&quot; (SPM) or Malaysian Certificate of Education examination, before graduating from secondary school. The SPM was based on the old British School Certificate examination before it became General Certificate of Education O Levels examination, which became the GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education). As of 2006, students are given a GCE &#x27;O&#x27; Level grade for their English paper in addition to the normal English SPM paper. (Previously, this was reported on result slips as a separate result labelled 1119, which meant students received two grades for their English papers.) This separate grade is given based on the marks of the essay-writing component of the English paper. The essay section of the English paper is remarked under the supervision of officials from the British O Levels examination. Although not part of their final certificates, the O Level grade is included on their results slip.

Shortly after the release of the 2005 SPM results in March 2006, the Education Ministry announced it was considering reforming the SPM system due to what was perceived as over-emphasis on As. Local educators appeared responsive to the suggestion, with one professor at the University of Malaya deploring university students who could not write letters, debate, or understand footnoting. He complained that &quot;They don&#x27;t understand what I am saying. I cannot communicate with them.&quot; He claimed that &quot;Before 1957 (the year of independence), school heroes were not those with 8As or 9As, they were the great debaters, those good in drama, in sport, and those leading the Scouts and Girl Guides.&quot; A former Education Director-General, Murad Mohd Noor, agreed, saying that &quot;The rat race now begins at Standard 6 with the UPSR, with the competition resulting in parents forcing their children to attend private tuition.&quot; He also expressed dismay at the prevalence of students taking 15 or 16 subjects for the SPM, calling it &quot;unnecessary&quot;.

A subset of the public secondary schools are known as National-type Secondary Schools (&quot;Sekolah Menengah Jenis Kebangsaan&quot;, SMJK, 国民型华文中学, 华中). At Malayan Independence (1957), it was decided that secondary education would be provided in Malay-medium National Secondary Schools and English-medium National-type Secondary Schools. Fee paying, English-medium schools owned and administered by missionaries/religious bodies were offered government aid provided that they adopted the national curriculum. Secondary schools using other languages as medium of instruction, most of them Chinese schools, were offered government aid on the condition that they convert into English-medium schools. In the 1970s, as the government began to abolish English-medium education in public schools, all National-type Secondary School were gradually converted into Malay-medium schools. The term &quot;National-type Secondary School&quot; is not present in the Education Act of 1996, which blurred the distinction between SMK and SMJK.

However, Chinese educational groups are unwelcoming of the new development and continue to push for the distinction to be made between the 78 formerly Chinese-medium schools and other secondary schools. The schools continue to have &quot;SMJK&quot; on the school signboards and boards of directors continue to manage the school properties, as opposed to schools that are directly managed by the government. Most former Chinese-medium SMJK continue to have a majority Chinese student and teacher population, usually only accept students from Chinese-medium primary schools, have Chinese language(Bahasa Cina 华文) as a compulsory subject and have bilingual (Malay and Chinese) school announcements.

Other types of government or government-aided secondary schools include Religious Secondary School (&quot;Sekolah Menengah Agama&quot;), Technical Schools (Sekolah Menengah Teknik), Fully Residential Schools and MARA Junior Science College (Maktab Rendah Sains MARA).
Within the national public school system are a few magnet type/charter public high schools. Admissions are very selective, reserved for students who demonstrate outstanding academic achievement and potential at the elementary level, Year/Standard 1 through 6. These schools are either full-time day or boarding schools (&#x27;asrama penuh&#x27;). Examples of these schools are Sekolah Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Royal Military College (Malaysia) and Penang Free School.

Residential schools or Sekolah Berasrama Penuh are also known as Science Schools. These schools used to cater mainly for Malay elites but have since expanded as schools for nurturing Malays who are outstanding academically or those displaying talents in sports and leadership. The schools are modelled after British Boarding School.

==Post-secondary education (pre-university)==
After the SPM, students from public secondary school would have a choice of either studying Form 6 or the matriculation (pre-university). If they are accepted to continue studying in Form 6, they will also take the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (which is usually abbreviated as STPM) or Malaysian Higher School Certificate examination (its British equivalent is the General Certificate of Education A Level examination or internationally, the Higher School Certificate). STPM is regulated by the Malaysian Examinations Council. Although it is generally taken by those desiring to attend public universities in Malaysia, it is internationally recognised and may also be used, though rarely required, to enter private local universities for undergraduate courses.

Additionally all students may apply for admission to matriculation. This matriculation is a one or two-year programme run by the Ministry of Education. Previously, it was a one-year programme, but beginning 2006, 30% of all matriculation students were offered two-year programmes.

Not all applicants for matriculation are admitted and the selection criteria are not publicly declared, which has led to speculation that any criteria existing may not be adhered to. A race-based quota is applied on the admission process, with 90% of the places being reserved for the Bumiputeras, and the other 10% for the non-Bumiputeras.

Having been introduced after the abolishment of a racial-quota-based admission into universities, the matriculation programme continues the role of its predecessor, albeit in modified form. The matriculation programme adopts a semester basis examination (two semesters in a year). Similarly, STPM involves three-term examinations (one final examination every term), two resit examinations at the end of the final term (if desired by students), as well as coursework depending on each subject (except for General Studies where coursework is mandatory) covering all one and a half years&#x27; syllabus.

The Centre for Foundation Studies in Science, University of Malaya, offers two programmes only for Bumiputera students: i) The Science Program, a one-year course under the Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Higher Education. After completing the program, the students are placed into various science-based courses in local universities through the meritocracy system. ii) The Special Preparatory Program to Enter the Japanese Universities, a two-year intensive programme under the Look East Policy Division of the Public Service Department of Malaysia in co-operation with the Japanese Government.

Some students undertake their pre-university studies in private colleges. They may opt for programmes such as the British A Level programme, the Canadian matriculation programme or the equivalent of other national systems – namely the Australian NSW Board of Studies Higher School Certificate and the American High School Diploma with AP subjects. More recently, the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme is becoming more popular as a pre-university option.

The Government has claimed that admission to universities are purely meritocracy based and do not have plans to change the system.

==Tertiary education==

Tertiary education is heavily subsidised by the government. The first university created in Malaysia is University Malaya, established on 1905.

Before the introduction of the matriculation system, students aiming to enter public universities had to complete an additional 18 months of secondary schooling in Form 6 and sit the Malaysian Higher School Certificate (&quot;Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia&quot;, STPM); equivalent to the British Advanced or A Level.

Since the introduction of the matriculation programme as an alternative to STPM in 1999, students who completed the 12-month programme in matriculation colleges (kolej matrikulasi in Malay) can enrol in local universities. However, in the matriculation system, only 10% of the places are open to non-Bumiputra students. Excellence in these examinations does not guarantee a place in a public university. The selection criteria are largely opaque as no strictly enforced defined guidelines exist.

The classification of tertiary education in Malaysia is organised upon the Malaysian Qualifications Framework (MQF) which seeks to set up a unified system of post secondary qualifications offered on a national basis in the vocational and higher education sectors.

From 2004 to 2013, the government formed the Ministry of Higher Education to oversee tertiary education in Malaysia.

The government announced a reduction of reliance of racial quotas in 2002, instead leaning more towards meritocracy. Before 2004, all lecturers in public tertiary institutions were required to have some post-graduate award as a qualification. In October 2004, this requirement was removed and the Higher Education Ministry announced that industry professionals who added value to a course could apply for lecturing positions directly to universities even if they did not have postgraduate qualifications. To head off possible allegations that the universities faced a shortage of lecturers, Deputy Higher Education Minister Datuk Fu Ah Kiow said &quot;This is not because we are facing a shortage of lecturers, but because this move will add value to our courses and enhance the name of our universities. Let&#x27;s say Bill Gates and Steven Spielberg, both [undergraduates but] well known and outstanding in their fields, want to be teaching professors. Of course, we would be more than happy to take them in.&quot; He went on to offer as an example the field of architecture whereby well-known architects recognised for their talents do not have master&#x27;s degrees.

There are 20 public universities established in Malaysia with each have differences specialization. The universities is separated into several types, such as Research based (University Malaya, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Universiti Sains Malaysia, University Putra Malaysia and University of Technology Malaysia). There is also TVET based such as Malaysian Technical University Network, focused university (such as Sultan Idris Education University) and comprehensive university (such as Universiti Malaysia Sabah). Islamic university such as International Islamic University Malaysia is established under OIC funding. Universiti Teknologi MARA is established to assist rural Malays.

Students have the option of enrolling in private tertiary institutions after secondary studies. Private universities are gaining a reputation for international quality education and students from all over the world attend them. Many of these institutions offer courses in co-operation with a foreign institute or university – especially in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia – allowing students to spend a portion of their course abroad as well as getting overseas qualifications. One such example is Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman which partnered with National Taiwan University, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Regensburg University of Applied Sciences and Tunghai University.

Many private colleges offer programmes whereby the student does part of his degree course here and part of it in the other institution; this is called &quot;twinning&quot;. The nature of these programs is diverse and ranges from the full &quot;twinning&quot; program where all credits and transcripts are transferable and admission is automatic to programs where the local institution offers an &quot;associate degree&quot; which is accepted at the discretion of the partnering university. In the latter case, acceptance of transcripts and credits is at the discretion of the partner. Some of them are branch campuses of these foreign institutions. In addition, four reputable international universities have set up their branch campuses in Malaysia since 1998. A branch can be seen as an &#x27;offshore campus&#x27; of the foreign university, which offers the same courses and awards as the main campus. Local and international students can acquire these identical foreign qualifications in Malaysia at a lower fee.

Some of the foreign university branch campuses in Malaysia are:
* University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus
* Monash University Malaysia Campus
* Curtin University, Malaysia
* Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus
* Newcastle University Medicine Malaysia (NUMed)
* University of Southampton Malaysia Campus
* Heriot-Watt University Malaysia
* University of Reading Malaysia
* Xiamen University Malaysia
* Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and University College Dublin Malaysia Campus
* University of Tsukuba Malaysia Campus

Others are
* SAE Institute, Australia
* Raffles Design Institute, Singapore

The net outflow of academics from Malaysia led to a &quot;brain gain&quot; scheme by then (1995) Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad. The scheme set a target of attracting 5,000 talents annually. In 2004, Science, Technology and Innovation Minister, Datuk Dr Jamaluddin Jarjis in a parliamentary reply stated that the scheme attracted 94 scientists (24 Malaysians) in pharmacology, medicine, semi-conductor technology and engineering from abroad between 1995 and 2000. At the time of his reply, only one was remaining in Malaysia.

===Postgraduate programmes===
Postgraduate degrees such as the Master of Business Administration (MBA) and the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) are becoming popular and are offered by public and private universities.

All public and most private universities in Malaysia offer Master of Science degrees either through coursework or research and Doctor of Philosophy degrees through research.

===Polytechnics===
Polytechnics in Malaysia provide courses for bachelor&#x27;s degree, Advanced Diploma, Diploma and Special Skills Certificate.

The following is a list of the polytechnics in Malaysia in order of establishment:

==Other types of schools==
Apart from national schools, there are other types of schools in Malaysia.

===Islamic religious schools===
A system of Islamic religious schools exists in Malaysia. Primary schools are called &quot;Sekolah Rendah Agama&quot; (SRA), while secondary schools are called &quot;Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Agama&quot; (SMKA). Another group of religious schools are Sekolah Agama Bantuan Kerajaan (SABK). SABK includes secondary schools and may also include a type of primary schools called community religious schools or &quot;sekolah agama rakyat&quot; (SAR).

The SAR schools teach Muslim students subjects related to Islam such as early Islamic history, Arabic language and Fiqh. It is not compulsory though some states such as Johor make it mandatory for all Muslim children aged six to twelve to attend the schools as a complement to the mandatory primary education. In the final year, students will sit an examination for graduation. Most SAR are funded by respective states and managed by states&#x27; religious authority. Previously, former Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohammad suggested to the government that the SARs should be closed down and integrated into the national schools. However, his proposal was met with resistance and later, the matter was left to die quietly. Such schools still exist in Malaysia, but are generally no longer the only part of a child&#x27;s education in urban areas. Students in rural parts of the country do still attend these schools. Some of the academic results published by these schools are accepted by mainline universities by taking Malaysia High Certificate of Religious Study (Sijil Tinggi Agama Malaysia, abbreviated as STAM), and many of these students continue their education in locations such as Pakistan or Egypt. Some of their alumni include Nik Adli (son of PAS spiritual leader Nik Aziz). SAR may become part of SABK formed in 2005.

Some parents also opt to send their children for religious classes after secular classes. Sunday schools and after school classes at the mosque are various options available. In many normal schools, there are also religious classes called Kelas Aliran Agama.

===Chinese independent high schools===

After receiving primary education in national-type primary schools, some students from SJK(C) may choose to study in a Chinese independent high school (Chinese: ). Chinese independent high schools are funded by the Malaysian Chinese public, with UCSCAM (United Chinese School Committees&#x27; Association of Malaysia, also known as &quot;Dong Zong&quot; after its Chinese acronym) as the overall co-ordination body. Students in Chinese independent high schools study in three junior middle levels and three senior middle levels; each level takes one year. Like the students in public secondary schools, students in Chinese independent high schools are put into several streams like Science or Art/Commerce in the senior middle levels. However, some schools recently provided unique streams like Electrical Engineering, Food and Beverage Studies or Arts Design. The medium of instruction in Chinese independent high schools is Mandarin and uses simplified Chinese characters in writing.

Students in Chinese independent high schools take standardised tests known as the Unified Examination Certificate (UEC) at the end of Junior Middle 3 and Senior Middle 3. UEC has been run by UCSCAM since 1975 and has won ISO9001 certification from Malaysia, China, UK, Japan and so on. The UEC is available in three levels: Vocational Unified Exam (UEC-V), UEC Junior Middle Level (UEC-JML/JUEC) and Senior Middle Level (UEC-SML/SUEC). The syllabus and examinations for the UEC-V and UEC-JML are only available in the Chinese language. The UEC-SML has questions for mathematics, sciences (biology, chemistry and physics), bookkeeping, accounting and commerce in both Chinese and English.

The government of Malaysia does not recognise the UEC-SML currently, hence the UEC holders are not accepted into public universities in Malaysia. UEC-SML is however, accepted by most private universities and colleges in Malaysia. In addition, UEC-SML is recognised as an entrance qualification in many tertiary educational institutions internationally, including those in The United States, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, Japan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and some European countries.

After the General Election 2018 in Malaysia, the incoming Pakatan Harapan government had promised for UEC to be recognised for entrance into public universities and civil service in Malaysia. It is a matter that is still under consideration and has not been implemented.

====Dong Jiao Zong&#x27;s policy====

=====A &quot;rooted&quot; Chinese=====

According to the UCSCAM, it was the British colonial policy (1786–1957) to allow vernacular language schools to exist and develop, along with Sekolah Pondok (Malays) and Sekolah Tamil (Indians). This was part of the British strategy of &quot;dividing and rule&quot;. For those who are willing to attend English schools, they will gain better opportunities in employment than any other schools, sometimes at the expense of their own racial/ethnic and religious root(s). Nevertheless, the development of Chinese language education thrived due to the conformity to the divide and rule policy. Before Malaysia gained independence, the Chinese had 1300 primary schools, nearly 100 high schools, and even a tertiary institution, Nanyang University, built without the financial support of the government. The report of Dong Zong claimed that the main reason for many Chinese parents sending their children to Chinese schools was that they generally hoped their children would retain their Chinese identity, with love and awareness of the nation of Malaysia, love of their own culture and traditions, ethnic pride, and most importantly being aware of their ethnic roots.

Lim Lian Geok (), known as the &quot;Soul of the Malaysian Chinese&quot; (Chinese: 族魂), the former president of UCSCAM regarded cultural right as of utmost importance since culture is the soul of every ethnicity, deserving the most respect among all of the rights. He said: &quot;One’s culture is the soul of one’s nation, and its value as important to us as our lives.&quot;, &quot;We, Chinese become Malayan nationals on the condition that we do our duty and loyalty to this country, not on the condition that we abandon our mother tongue and destroy our culture.&quot;, &quot;Malayan was a virgin land, it gain the prosperous of today under the efforts of all nations.&quot; and &quot;In ethnically diverse nations, harmony, friendship, peace and cooperation are important principles, but all must be based on equality.&quot;

====&quot;Final goal&quot;====

The UCSCAM believed that the government of Malaysia had a &quot;final goal&quot; (referring to the Razak Report) to eradicate the Chinese schools and Tamil schools. The report claimed that the government of Malaysia&#x27;s culture and language education policy, over the past 50 years was, to not give up implementation of the &quot;final goal&quot;: a final &quot;national school&quot; with the Malay language (National language) as the main medium of instruction. The language of other ethnic groups, namely Chinese and Tamil, thus could only serve as a foreign language. The reason given by the government was that the Chinese and Tamil primary schools were the root cause of disunity of this country. To achieve &quot;national unity&quot;, all other non-national schools should be restricted, and finally merged with the national school.

====&quot;Do not give up and do not compromise&quot;====

The standpoint of UCSCAM is that only the implementation of a multilingual school policy befits Malaysia&#x27;s multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, multi-linguistic and multi-religious society. Dong Jiao Zong&#x27;s distinctive position for this protest has remained unchanged over the last 50 years.

===International Schools===
International schools use curricula of foreign countries or international curricula such as International Baccalaureate, Edexcel or Cambridge International Examinations. See for a listing.

==School uniforms==
Present-day Malaysia introduced Western-style school uniforms () in the late 19th century during the British colonial era. Today, school uniforms are almost universal in the public and private school systems.

A common version of the Malaysian school uniform is of public schools. The dress code for males is the most standardised while female uniforms are more varied based on the religion of students and the type of schools. Male students are required to wear a collared shirt with a pair of shorts or long pants. Female students may wear a knee-length pinafore and a collared shirt, a knee-length skirt and a collared shirt, or a &quot;baju kurung&quot; consisting of a top and a long skirt with an optional hijab (tudung) for Muslim students. White socks and shoes of black or white are almost universally required for students, while ties are included in certain dress codes. Prefects, Form Six students (varies in some schools) and students with other additional school duties may wear uniforms of different colours; colours may differ between primary and secondary schools.

Starting March 2024, students are no longer be required to wear school uniforms throughout the week. Instead, it is two days of school uniform, two days of sportswear, and one day of co-curriculum attire. This decision by the Ministry of Education came after a deliberate study on issues like weather, floods, and convenience of parents, teachers, and students.

==Education policy==
Education in Malaysia is monitored by the federal government Ministry of Education. In July 2006, Higher Education Deputy Minister Datuk Ong Tee Keat stated that a review of the controversial Universities and University Colleges Act 1971 will be held among Malaysian MPs. The ruling political alliance is composed of ethnically based parties and one of the concessions allowed by the controlling Malay party is to allow the Chinese and Indian parties to start colleges.

===National Education Blueprint 2006–2010===
In 2006, the National Education Blueprint 2006–10 was released. The Blueprint set a number of goals, such as establishing a National Pre-School Curriculum, setting up 100 new classes for students with special needs, increasing the percentage of single-session schools to 90% for primary schools and 70% for secondary schools, and decreasing class sizes from 31 to 30 students in primary schools and from 32 to 30 in secondary schools by the year 2010. The Blueprint also provided a number of statistics concerning weaknesses in education. According to the Blueprint, 10% of primary schools and 1.4% of secondary schools do not have a 24-hour electricity supply, 20% and 3.4% respectively do not have a public water supply, and 78% and 42% are over 30 years old and require refurbishing. It was also stated that 4.4% of primary students and 0.8% of secondary students had not mastered the &quot;3Ms&quot; (reading, writing and arithmetic). The drop-out rate for secondary schools was given as 9.3% in urban areas and 16.7% in rural areas.

The Blueprint also aimed to address the problem of racial polarisation in schools. Under the Blueprint, schools will hold seminars on the Constitution of Malaysia, motivational camps to increase cultural awareness, food festivals to highlight different ethnic cooking styles, and essay competitions on different cultural traditions. Mandarin and Tamil language classes will be held in national schools, beginning with a pilot project in 220 schools in 2007.

The Blueprint has been subject to some criticism. Academic Khoo Kay Kim has criticised the plan, saying:

===National Education Blueprint 2013–2025===
In 2013, the National Education Blueprint was released. It covers the education of Malaysian starting from Preschool until Post-Secondary.The approach of the blueprint was ground-breaking as it uses multiple perspectives to evaluate and assess the performance of Malaysia&#x27;s education system. This included the World Bank, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and six local universities. The Ministries also worked with other governmental agencies to ensure alignment with other policies related to education. Furthermore, the Ministry engaged also with the people in a new scale; Over 55000 Ministry officials, teachers, school leaders, parents, students, and members of public across Malaysia via interviews, focus groups, surveys, National Dialogue town halls, Open Days and round table discussions. More than 200 memorandums and 3000 articles and blog post were submitted by the Ministry.

The blueprint highlights aspirations to ensure universal access and full enrolment of all children from preschool through to upper secondary school level by 2020; aspirations for Malaysia to be in the top third of countries in terms of performance in international assessments, as measured by outcomes in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) within 15 years, aspires to halve the current urban-rural, socio-economic and gender achievement gaps by 2020; aspirations to create a system whereby students have opportunities to build shared experiences and aspirations that form the foundation for unity, aspires to further maximise student outcomes within current budget levels.

It also has identified 11 shifts that will need to occur to deliver the step change in outcomes envisioned by Malaysians. Each shift is to address at least one of the five system outcomes of access, quality, equity, unity and efficiency. Among the many steps to be taken, it is part of the plan to increase compulsory schooling from six to 11 years, starting at the age of six years supported by targeted retention programmes, launch the Secondary School Standard Curriculum or Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Menengah (KSSM) and revised Primary School Standard Curriculum or Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Rendah (KSSR) in 2017 to embed a balanced set of knowledge and skills such as creative thinking, innovation, problem-solving and leadership, lay out clear learning standards so that students and parents understand the progress expected within each year of schooling, revamp the national examination and school-based assessments in stages, whereby by 2016 at least 40 per cent of questions in Ujian Penilaian Sekolah Rendah (UPSR) and 50 per cent in Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) are higher-order thinking questions and by the end of 2013, is to build academic and career counselling services into the secondary school timetable to help students make better informed choices about the various education pathways on offer.

By 2025, it is to ensure that Orang Asli students, other minority groups and students with physical or learning disabilities go to schools with the facilities and equipment needed to create a conductive and supportive learning environment, from 2016, is to ensure that English is made a compulsory subject to pass for SPM, by 2025, is to ensure that every student is encouraged to learn an additional language in the move to equip them well for entering the workforce in a globalising world, will focus on building up its cadre of Chinese, Tamil and Arabic language teachers to ensure that the supply of teachers matches student demand, besides expanding the provision of other important languages such as Spanish, French and Japanese, from 2013, is to ensure that the entry bar for teachers is raised to be amongst the top 30 per cent of graduates, from 2013, is to ensure that teachers enjoy a reduced administrative burden so that they can focus the majority of their time on their core function of teaching, with some administrative functions moved to a centralised service centre or to a dedicated administrative teacher at the school level, by 2015, is to ensure that all schools meet basic infrastructure requirements, starting with Sabah and Sarawak, is to ensure that the Trust School model is expanded to 500 schools by 2025, including by alumni groups and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as potential sponsors, will publish an annual report on the progress made against each initiative outlined in the blueprint, will undertake a stock-take at key milestones in the blueprint journey in 2015, 2020 and 2025.

==Issues in Malaysian education==

The history of issues in Malaysian education started since the British government period: the Barnes Report in 1951 to unite all races with the colonial language. The later Razak Report was made to replace the unsuccessful Barnes Report, and the system remains until today.

===Language===
The issue of language and schools is a key issue for many political groups in Malaysia. However, under the Razak Report, primary schools using the Chinese and Tamil language as medium of instruction are retained. Up until 1981 in Peninsular Malaysia (and some years later in Sabah and Sarawak), there were English-medium schools, set up by the former colonial government and Christian missionaries. Following the implementation of the 1967 National Language Act which stipulated the conversion of all English-medium schools to Malay-medium schools; as well with severe race riots in Kuala Lumpur that occurred later in May 1969, English-medium schools were phased out from January 1970; by 1982 these became Malay-medium schools (&quot;national schools&quot;).

The existence of national-type schools is used by non-Malays components of the ruling Barisan Nasional to indicate that their culture and identity have not been infringed upon by the Malay people. Dong Jiao Zhong (the association of Chinese school boards and teachers) and other Chinese education organisations took on the role of safeguarding Chinese education in the country and are opposed to Malay replacing Chinese as medium of instruction in Chinese schools. They shape much of the views of the Chinese educated community, which is a key electoral constituency.

In 2002, the government announced that from 2003 onwards, the teaching of Science and Mathematics would transition to English as the main medium, which was planned under a belief that Malaysia would not be left behind in a world that was rapidly globalising presumably using the language. This paved the way for the establishment of mixed-medium education. However, the policy was heavily criticised by Malay linguists and activists, fearing that the policy might erode the usage of Malay language in science and mathematics, which led to a massive rally in Kuala Lumpur on 7 March 2009. Chinese education groups opposed the policy as well, fearing that it might erode the usage of Chinese as the medium of instruction in Chinese schools. Abdullah Badawi&#x27;s government announced in 2009 that this policy will be reversed in 2012: the teaching of both subjects would revert to Malay. However, the Ministry has since launched the Dual Language Program (DLP) to cater the language issue.

Due to the lack of Chinese and Indian students attending national schools, coupled with the increasing number of Malay students attending Chinese and Indian national-type schools, the government announced in April 2005 that all national schools will begin teaching Chinese and Tamil to attract more students, not as mother tongue courses but as elective courses.

===Gender===
In 2004 the UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) representative Dr. Richard Leete stated that Malaysia&#x27;s ranking in the UNDP gender index was not &quot;as high as it should be&quot;. Former Higher Education Minister Datuk Dr Shafie Salleh replied that it was not unique to Malaysia. His quoted statistics revealed that there was a 2:1 ratio of boys to girls in polytechnics and at public higher learning institutions. In virtually all developed countries females and males enter university in approximately equal ratios. Thus, the 2:1 ratio in Malaysia is seen as rather peculiar when placed in a global context.

Malaysian polytechnics and community colleges are not degree-producing institutions and none have post-graduate programmes. Most are vocational or technical institutions. This imbalance is corrected once the respective genders leave the education system.

===Racial quotas in public universities===
In 1973, the Malaysian government implemented an affirmative action program, setting a quota of 55% of university places for Bumiputeras and the remaining 45% for Chinese and Indian students. The university quota system created considerable unhappiness among the Chinese and Indians.

In 2000, the quota for Bumiputera is raised to 90% and limited the intake of non-Bumiputera such as Indian and Chinese to 10%.

By 2008, the quota for university entrance had been abolished. Quotas in the matriculation program remained.

In 2010, the Indian community was shocked at the low 2% to 3% intake of Indian students into public universities. Indians are faring badly under the quota system used for university intake. Under the meritocratic system, about 5% to 10% of the students were Indians.

In 2019, the Minister of Education Maszlee Malik mentioned that the cabinet discussed the issue and decided to maintain the 90% quota. He also mentioned the decision to raise the amount of seats available, and that there would be some priority for the bottom 40% (B40) income group.

In 2020, it was announced that the 10% of vacancies for non-bumiputera in matriculation program would be divided into 5.43% for the Chinese, 3.72% for the Indian and 0.85% for others.

<doc id="461997" wikidata="Q997762" url="?curid=461997" title="Lake Pleshcheyevo">
<text>Lake Pleshcheyevo () is a glacial lake in Yaroslavl Oblast, Russia. The historic town of Pereslavl-Zalessky is on the southeastern side of the lake.

The lake, which is part of Pleshcheyevo Ozero National Park, covers an area of over 51 km2, its length being and its shoreline . Although it is deep in the middle, the waters near the shore are quite shallow. The lake is well known for camping, swimming, fishing, and hot air ballooning.

==History==
The Primary Chronicle refers to the Lake of Kleshchin, which was a Meryan town on its shore. The major relic of Kleshchin is a legendary twelve-ton boulder, the &quot;Blue stone&quot;, which was worshipped by pagans in centuries past, and is still a venue for celebrating Russian Orthodox holidays.

In 1688–1693, Peter the Great built his famous &quot;funny flotilla&quot; (i. e. training flotilla) on Lake Pleshcheyevo for his own amusement, including the so-called Peter&#x27;s little boat, which would be considered one of the forefathers of the Russian fleet. The Botik (small boat) museum in Pereslavl-Zalessky chronicles the history of the first Russian fleet and keeps one of the original ship models.

In 1925, author Mikhail Prishvin spent a year at a research station near the lake and wrote up his observations of the landscape in his work &quot;The Springs of Berendey&quot;.

== Fishing ==
The lake is noted for its associations with vendace, or &quot;freshwater herring&quot; (&quot;ryapushka&quot; in Russian). Pereslavl&#x27;s coat of arms has two golden ryapushka on a black ground. This town was known in the Middle Ages for exporting smoked ryapushka, which was the favorite fish at the Tsars&#x27; table.

<doc id="462000" wikidata="Q7437684" url="?curid=462000" title="Scottish Covenant">
<text>The Scottish Covenant was a petition to the United Kingdom government to create a home rule Scottish parliament. First proposed in 1930, and promoted by the &quot;Scots Independent&quot; in 1939, the National Covenant movement reached its peak during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Initiated by John MacCormick, the Covenant was written in October 1949 at the Church of Scotland Assembly Halls in Edinburgh, during the Third National Assembly of the Scottish Convention, a pressure group which evolved into the Scottish Covenant Association.

The petition was &quot;eventually signed by two million people&quot;. In the census of 1951, the population of Scotland was 5.1 million.

The Scottish Covenant, however, had little political impact, and it was not until 1977 that proposals for a Scottish Assembly became a serious political prospect. The current Scottish Parliament was convened in 1999.

The name of the Covenant is a reference to the Solemn League and Covenant which established the rights of the Church of Scotland in the 17th century. An Ulster Covenant was also made in 1912, opposing the idea of home rule in Ireland.

==Text of the Covenant==
&quot;We, the people of Scotland who subscribe to this Engagement, declare our belief that reform in the constitution of our country is necessary to secure good government in accordance with our Scottish traditions and to promote the spiritual and economic welfare of our nation.&quot;

&quot;We affirm that the desire for such reform is both deep and widespread through the whole community, transcending all political differences and sectional interests, and we undertake to continue united in purpose for its achievement.&quot;

&quot;With that end in view we solemnly enter into this Covenant whereby we pledge ourselves, in all loyalty to the Crown and within the framework of the United Kingdom, to do everything in our power to secure for Scotland a Parliament with adequate legislative authority in Scottish affairs.&quot;

==Response==
On 3 November 1949, a few days after the Edinburgh launch, the Unionist Party, then the country&#x27;s dominant political party, forced an adjournment debate in the House of Commons calling for a royal commission into Scottish affairs, with the aim of increasing administrative devolution to Scotland, including a larger ministerial team at the Scottish Office and the establishment of Scottish nationalised industries.

The Labour government of the time dismissed the Scottish Covenant. In answer to a question in the House of Lords in May 1950 put to His Majesty&#x27;s Government, Labour Peer Lord Morrison both objected in principle to home rule and stated that the matters involved were &#x27;much too complicated&#x27; to be put to referendum.

In 1955, Colin Thornton-Kemsley MP for North Angus and Mearns pointed out that despite the Covenant only one of the 71 MPs representing Scottish seats could be said to support devolution, that one member being Jo Grimond, Liberal MP for Orkney and Shetland.

The Scottish philosopher Herbert James Paton cites the 1949 Covenant in his disquisition &quot;The Claim of Scotland&quot; (1968) and partly frames his defence, robustly yet peacably set out, with reference to the governmental omission in the 1950s to heed the Covenant and its signatories.

<doc id="462001" wikidata="Q472649" url="?curid=462001" title="Ricky Ponting">
<text>Ricky Thomas Ponting (born 19 December 1974) is an Australian cricket coach, commentator and former player. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time and is the most successful captain in international cricket history, with 220 victories in 324 matches with a winning rate of 67.91%.

He has made the third highest number of centuries in international cricket, behind Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli. He holds the record for winning most ICC tournaments as a captain in Men&#x27;s Cricket, including the 2003 and 2007 Cricket World Cups, and 2006 and 2009 Champions Trophies. He was also a member of the 1999 Cricket World Cup winning Australian team.

Domestically, Ponting played for his home state of Tasmania as well as Tasmania&#x27;s Hobart Hurricanes in Australia&#x27;s domestic Twenty20 competition, the Big Bash League. He played as a specialist right-handed batsman, an excellent slip fielder, as well as a very occasional bowler. He led Australia to their second 5–0 Ashes win as well as victory at the 2003 and 2007 Cricket World Cups and was also a member of the 1999 World Cup winning team under Steve Waugh. He led Australia to consecutive ICC Champions Trophy victory in 2006 and 2009. Combative and at times a controversial captain, statistically he is one of the most successful Test captains of all time, with 48 victories in 77 Tests. As a player, Ponting is the only cricketer in history to be involved in 100 Test victories and was involved in the most ODI victories as a player, with 262 wins, having played in over 160 Tests and 370 ODIs.

A prolific batsman, Ponting is Australia&#x27;s leading run-scorer in Test and ODI cricket. He was named &quot;Cricketer of the Decade 2000&quot; was named in the country&#x27;s best Ashes XI in a Cricket Australia poll in 2017 and in July 2018 he was inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame. He is the current assistant coach of the Australian national men&#x27;s cricket team, having been appointed to the role in February 2019.

Ponting announced his retirement from Test cricket in November 2012, the day before playing in his final Test against South Africa; this was his 168th and last Test appearance, equalling the Australian record held by Steve Waugh. He retired with a Test batting average of 51.85, although he continued to play cricket around the world until 2013.

==1974–1995: Early life==
===Birth and personal life===

Born in Launceston, Tasmania, on 19 December 1974, Ricky Ponting is the eldest of Graeme and Lorraine Ponting&#x27;s 3 children. Graeme was &quot;a good club cricketer&quot; and played Australian rules football, while Lorraine was a state vigoro champion. His uncle Greg Campbell played Test cricket for Australia in 1989 and 1990. Ponting&#x27;s parents first lived in Prospect south of city centre; however, they moved into the working-class area of Newnham, north of central Launceston.

After marrying his long-time girlfriend, law student Rianna Cantor, in June 2002, Ponting credited her as the reason for his increased maturity. The couple have three children.

===Junior ranks===
Introduced to cricket by father Graeme and uncle Greg Campbell, Ponting played for the Mowbray Under-13s team at the age of 11 in 1985–86. In January 1986, he took part in the five-day annual Northern Tasmania junior cricket competition. After scoring four centuries in a week, bat manufacturer Kookaburra gave Ponting a sponsorship contract while in just eighth grade mainly on the back of these four centuries. Ponting took this form into the Under-16s week-long competition less than a month later, scoring an even century on the final day. Ted Richardson, the former head of the Northern Tasmanian Schools Cricket Association said: &quot;Ricky is certainly the equal of David Boon at this level.

Australian Rules football was also a big part of Ponting&#x27;s sporting life, and is a keen follower of the North Melbourne Kangaroos. In 2024, Ponting’s Wine brand (Ponting Wines) announced a partnership with North Melbourne During the winter he played junior football for North Launceston and up until he was 14, it could have become a possible sporting option. This was before he broke the humerus in his right arm playing for North Launceston Under-17s as a 13-year-old. Ponting&#x27;s arm was so badly damaged, it had to be pinned. Told to endure a 14-week lay-off, he never played competitive football again.

During Tasmanian Sheffield Shield matches at the NTCA Ground (Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association Ground), Ponting helped out with the scoreboard, thereby surrounding himself with international cricketers. After leaving school at the end of year 10 in 1990, he began work as a groundsman at Scotch Oakburn College, a private school in Launceston. In 1991 the Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association sponsored Ponting to attend a fortnight&#x27;s training at the Australian Cricket Academy in Adelaide. The two weeks turned into a full two-year sponsorship as he was said to be the best 17-year-old batsman Academy coach Rod Marsh had ever seen.

Playing five games for Tasmania for the 1992 Under-19 carnival in Perth, Ponting scored 350 runs, earning him selection in the 13-man national Under-19 development squad for the upcoming tour of South Africa—the first Australian cricket team to make an official tour to the country since Bill Lawry&#x27;s team in 1970.

===Early Australian domestic career===
Ponting made his first-class debut for Tasmania in November 1992, when just 17 years and 337 days old, becoming the youngest Tasmanian to play in a Sheffield Shield match. However, he had to wait until 1995 before making his ODI debut, during a quadrangular tournament in New Zealand in a match against South Africa. His Test debut followed shortly after, when selected for the first Test of the 1995 home series against Sri Lanka in Perth, in which he scored 96. He lost his place in the national team several times in the period before early-1999, due to lack of form and discipline, before becoming One Day International captain in early-2002 and Test captain in early 2004.
After scoring 114 not out in club match against Riverside, Ponting became the youngest player to appear for Tasmania in a Sheffield Shield match, breaking Boon&#x27;s record by 14 days. In November 1992, with Ponting just 17 years and 337 days, he went to the crease at number four against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. Despite scoring 56 in a 127-run partnership with Boon, he could not prevent a defeat, scoring just four in Tasmania&#x27;s second innings. In his first match in Tasmania, this time against New South Wales, Ponting contributed 32 and 18 in a draw. He followed this up with 25 against Western Australia in a narrow loss. His first match in Sydney also marked the debut of future Australian opening bowler Glenn McGrath. His subsequent century also meant that Ponting became the youngest Tasmanian to score a first-class century at 18 years and 40 days, eclipsing Boon&#x27;s record of 19 years and 356 days. After scoring another half century, Ponting scored back to back centuries against Western Australia on Australia&#x27;s fastest wicket in Perth. He became the youngest batsmen in Shield history to score twin centuries in a match. After setting a goal of scoring 500 runs in the season, he ended up scoring 781 at 48.81. After season&#x27;s end, Ponting played seven four-day games for the Australian Academy, scoring 484 runs at 96.70, even though he was still only 18.

Speculation ignited that Ponting was an outsider to join the Australian squad on their 1993 tour to England. Despite Ponting&#x27;s reluctance to weigh into the debate, Tasmanian coach Greg Shipperd thought he could handle the experience. The selectors ended up choosing Western Australian batsman Damien Martyn for the tour, with Ponting selected in the academy squad captained by Justin Langer, which toured India and Sri Lanka for seven games in August–September 1993. Australian success was limited, with only several wins. No batsman scored a century, despite Ponting reaching 99 not out in a one-day game in Colombo. He finished the tour second highest in the aggregates, behind Langer.
Before the start of the 1993–94 Sheffield Shield season, Ponting stated that he wanted to score 1000 runs for the season. In Tasmania&#x27;s final match of the season, they needed to defeat South Australia outright to qualify for the final. Set 366 in 102 overs, Ponting scored 161 in a 290-run partnership that ended with Tasmania needing just 41 runs for victory. Despite Tasmania losing four quick wickets, they won with four wickets in hand. Disappointingly for Ponting, he could not repeat the performance in the final against New South Wales, scoring just one and 28, as Tasmania were defeated by an innings and 61 runs. The season saw Ponting score 965 runs at 48.25, close to his 1000 run goal.

A month after the final, he was again selected for the academy squad for three limited overs matches against a touring Indian team. Queenslander Stuart Law captained the Australian side that included former Australian keeper Rod Marsh. In Australia&#x27;s victory in Canberra he top scored with 71 and before scoring 52 in victory in Sydney. The last match was also successful for the home team, with Ponting not required to bat.

Ponting started his 1994–95 campaign with a century against eventual Shield champions Queensland in Brisbane, impressing Queensland captain Allan Border, &quot;He&#x27;s just an outstanding prospect&quot;, Border said.
Speculation again arose that Ponting could become a candidate for the upcoming tour to the West Indies. When Tasmania played Western Australia at Bellerive Oval on 4 November 1994, Ponting scored 211. The century was his fifth successive against Western Australia; Sir Donald Bradman is the only other batsman to score five consecutive centuries against another state in Shield history. Ten days after the double century, Ponting was named in the Australian XI to take on England at Bellerive Oval—in a match that was used as practice before the upcoming series in the West Indies. Future Australian representatives Matthew Hayden, Langer, Greg Blewett and Martyn were also selected. In a drawn match Ponting compiled a half-century.

A fourth team was introduced to the World Series Cup in 1994–95—Australia A—for the only time. Australian captain Mark Taylor was not a fan of this change as many fans supported Australia A rather than the national team. Despite the negative feedback it gave Ponting a chance on the international stage. Playing for Australia A, he scored 161 runs at 26.83 with one half-century.

==1995–1999: Early International career==

===Australian debut===
Ponting&#x27;s domestic performances were rewarded when he was selected for the Australian ODI team to play in all the matches in the 1995 New Zealand Centenary quadrangular tournament in New Zealand, that also included South Africa and India. Ponting made his debut against South Africa at number six in the batting order. He scored one from six balls, as Australia successfully chased South Africa&#x27;s target on a difficult batting track. Australia secured another victory in their next match, this time against New Zealand in Auckland, where Ponting scored 10 not out, after coming to wicket late in the innings. His highest series score came in the third International where Australia lost to India in Dunedin. Ponting was promoted to number three in the batting order and responded by scoring 62 from 92 balls. The innings was scored without a boundary and was based on &quot;deft placement and judicious running.&quot; The loss failed to stop Australia from appearing in the final against New Zealand in Auckland. Ponting returned to number six and was seven not out when the winning runs were scored. He finished the series with 80 runs at 40 and strike rate of 71.42 runs per hundred balls.

Greg Shipperd publicly suggested that Ponting could be selected as a reserve wicket-keeper for the upcoming West Indies tour, despite not keeping-wicket for Tasmania. However, he had kept wicket in pre-season matches and during centre wicket practice. In any case Ponting was selected as a specialist batsman. &quot;... It was like all my birthdays had come at once. I had some reservations about making my Test debut against arguably the best fast bowling attack in the world&quot;, Ponting later said. The West Indies had been cricket&#x27;s powerhouse for close to two decades and teams included many feared fast bowlers. Before the tour, Australian captain Mark Taylor thought the last Test batting vacancy was possibly between Ponting and Justin Langer. &quot;Ricky Ponting is more the stroke player while Justin is the tough man. It depends on what we need at the time but you can probably say Ricky has his neck in front because he&#x27;s been on this tour [of New Zealand]&quot;, Taylor said. Rod Marsh believed Ponting&#x27;s attitude and fearless approach could tear the West Indies apart. Nevertheless, Ponting did not expect to be selected. Steve Waugh noted that Ponting would &quot;not be intimidated by the West Indians&#x27; inevitable waist-to-chin length.&quot; During the series, Ponting said the current crop of bowlers were not &quot;of the same high class&quot; that opposition teams had come to expect from the West Indies.

Ponting was selected for the third ODI on 12 March 1995 at Queen&#x27;s Park Oval, when Mark Waugh missed out through injury. Ponting—batting at three—was involved in a 59-run partnership with Steve Waugh; however, he was dismissed for 43 when he lifted an attempted pull shot. Mark Waugh returned for the next match and Ponting was subsequently dropped until he replaced an out-of-form David Boon in the fifth and final match, where Ponting got a second-ball duck. In a three-day warm-up match ahead of the Tests, Ponting scored 19, with Greg Blewett scoring a century and Langer compiling a half-century. The performance was not enough for Ponting to force his way into the Test side; though, Australia did regain the Frank Worrell Trophy for the first time in 20 years, winning the series 2–1. When Ponting returned to Launceston in June 1995, Tasmania&#x27;s TAB announced him as their part-time ambassador. He then undertook a tour to England with the Young Australians; a team that included fellow Tasmanian Shaun Young. It also included five future Test batsmen: Matthew Hayden, Matthew Elliott, Martin Love, Justin Langer and Stuart Law. Despite not batting as well as he &quot;would have liked&quot;, Ponting returned to Australia with the fourth highest batting average—48.73.

Tasmania toured Zimbabwe for five games ahead of the 1995–96 Sheffield Shield. Ponting struggled, aggregating 99 runs at a modest 24.75. By the end of October, he had signed a contract with the Australian Cricket Board, along with 22 other Australian cricketers. He opened the batting with Boon in Tasmania&#x27;s first match of the Sheffield Shield season, scoring 20 and 43. Ahead of the following match against Queensland in Hobart, Ponting set himself a goal of scoring a century in each innings; a feat he achieved in a high-scoring draw. His form continued against the touring Sri Lankans in a one-day game in Devonport, scoring 99. He scored another century against the same opposition in Launceston. During the match, the public address system at the NTCA Ground announced that Ponting was making his Test debut against Sri Lanka in Perth on 8 December. The following morning saw local newspaper &quot;The Examiner&quot; headline: &quot;He&#x27;s Ricky Ponting, he&#x27;s ours ... and he&#x27;s made it! Tassie&#x27;s batting star will play in his first Test.&quot; Marsh continued his praise of Ponting, who replaced a dropped Blewett. &quot;I have no doubt Ricky will be trying to get 100 in his first Test game. And I hope he does. You&#x27;d back him to. If Ricky carries with him the same attitude that he has seen him succeed at First-class cricket to the next level there is no reason why he will not continue to score.&quot;

Sri Lanka batted first and scored 251, before Ponting—batting at number five due to Steve Waugh&#x27;s absence through injury—arrived at the crease with Australia at a comfortable 3/422. He started nervously, edging his first ball past first slip for a boundary from off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. When Ponting reached 96, Chaminda Vaas hit Ponting high on his thigh and was given out leg before wicket. Many members of the crowd and media argued it was an incorrect decision due to excessive height. He combined with Stuart Law, also playing on debut, for a partnership of 121. This was only the ninth ever century partnership by debutants in Test cricket. &quot;I&#x27;ve got mixed emotions about my knock at the moment. 96 is a good score but it would have been nice to get a 100&quot;, Ponting said after the innings. &quot;Once I struck a few in the middle of the bat, and I spent some time in the middle I tried to relax and enjoy it, just savour the moment.&quot; Australia won the match by an innings. In the second Test in Melbourne on Boxing Day, he scored a &quot;compact&quot; 71 in his only innings, combining for a century stand with Steve Waugh. He also took the wicket of Asanka Gurusinha in Sri Lanka&#x27;s first innings amidst four economical overs.

However, Ponting&#x27;s performance was overshadowed by Australian umpire Darrell Hair no-balling Muralitharan for throwing on seven occasions, increasing tensions between the two teams. Ponting&#x27;s fellow Tasmanian Boon retired after the Third Test, and Ponting&#x27;s performances were not as strong at number six in the batting order, managing six and 20. Australia won yet again, sweeping the series 3–0, and Ponting was in full praise of Boon. &quot;I would have hated to be the first person to come through from Launceston and make it but he has proved it can be done&quot;, Ponting said a year before his Test debut. Ponting ended his debut Test series with 193 runs at 48.25.

Though Ponting&#x27;s appearances for Tasmania continued to be limited, he was still able to top the 1995–96 season averages with 59.50. He played in all ten games of the World Series ODI Cup played between Australia, Sri Lanka and the West Indies after the Test series. Ponting started the series at number four but moved up a position midway through the season, after opener Michael Slater was dropped. He broke through for his maiden ODI century in his 12th match, scoring 123 from 138 balls against Sri Lanka at the MCG. However, the effort was not enough to prevent Sri Lanka from victory. Ponting ended his first home ODI tournament with 341 runs at 34.10, including one century and three fifties, as Australia ended as series champions.

===1996 World Cup===
A Tamil Tiger bombing in Colombo coupled with death threats to some members of the team forced Australia to forfeit their scheduled 1996 Cricket World Cup match against Sri Lanka in Colombo. Ponting batted in the number three position for the entire tournament, and scored six in Australia&#x27;s opening match victory over Kenya. He continued to be inconsistent with scores of 12 and 33 against India and Zimbabwe, before becoming the youngest batsman to score a World Cup century, when he scored 102 runs from 112 balls against the West Indies in Jaipur. Ponting wore a cap instead of a helmet to show the West Indians that he did not fear them. The effort was not enough, as Australia lost by four wickets. Australia finished second in their group and faced New Zealand in the quarter-finals. He scored 41 followed by a 15-ball duck in a semi-final victory against the West Indies, as Australia staggered to 8/207. Australia appeared to be heading out of the tournament when the Caribbean team reached 2/165, but a sudden collapse saw Australia win by six runs in the last over. Ponting scored 45 from 73 balls in the final at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, which Australia lost to Sri Lanka. Ponting ended his first World Cup campaign with 229 runs at 32.71.

In August, Australia played in the Singer Cup in Sri Lanka, after a five-month break since the World Cup. Despite the political environment being more assured than during the World Cup, Australia still struggled to defeat the Sri Lankans, now full of confidence. Australia overpowered Zimbabwe, before going down the home side. They regrouped and defeated India; however, Sri Lanka defeated Australia, this time in the final. Ponting scored: 53, 46 not out, 0 and 17 for the series. With Boon&#x27;s retirement, Ponting was elevated to the No. 3 position in the Test team, and his first assignment in his new role came in a one-off Test against India at the Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi. Foreshadowing his future Test struggles in India, Ponting made 13 and 14 in a seven-wicket defeat. His failed to regain his form in the following Titan Cup involving India, South Africa and Australia. After a &quot;scratchy&quot; game against South Africa, Ponting was rested for the next match against India. Nevertheless, he was recalled for the return match against South Africa, making 17. The series ending poorly for Ponting, being bowled for a duck, as India won the finals. The pair of ODI tournaments on the subcontinent yielded Ponting only 168 runs at 28.00 from seven matches.

Ponting continued in the role for the series against the West Indies in 1996–97 in Australia. After two Test matches and three scores under 10, he was replaced by Justin Langer, despite scoring 88 in the First Test. He was out of the team for six months, and missed the remaining three Tests against the West Indies, the three Tests on the tour to South Africa, both series victories to Australia. Many &quot;experts&quot; thought the decision was unjustifiable. Former Australian coach, Bob Simpson, said: &quot;I really feel that Ricky could have been persevered with. He&#x27;s a fine young cricketer and he&#x27;ll now have to prove that he&#x27;s got the tenacity and temperament to go with it.&quot; Ponting&#x27;s axing meant he had time to regain his form in the Sheffield Shield. Despite struggling at first, he scored twin centuries against South Australia in Hobart, and proceeded to score another ton against Queensland.

Ponting was selected for the 1997 Ashes tour of England, but did not play in any of the three preceding ODIs. He was not selected for the first three Tests; England won the first, Australia the third, and the second was drawn. Ponting was given three one-dayers and First-class match against Glamorgan to try to push his case for a Test inclusion. He scored a century in the latter, but managed just five against Middlesex in the last match before the Fourth Test. Michael Bevan was eventually dropped for Ponting, due to poor form and troubles against the short ball. In his first Ashes Test, Ponting scored his first Test century (127, batting at No. 6). He played the last three Tests and ended the series with 241 runs at 48.20. At the time Australia had a policy of the selecting the same team for ODIs, so Ponting only played in three ODIs in early stages of the 1996–97 season in Australia, scoring 68 runs at 22.66 in December 1996 before being dropped.

Ponting scored 119 runs at 39.66 in the three-Test home series against New Zealand in 1997–98, including a breezy 73 not out from 85 balls in the second innings of the First Test in Brisbane to help Australia set a winning target. He then made his first Test century on Australian soil, scoring 105 in the First Test against South Africa at the MCG. He added a fifty in the next match and ended the series with 248 runs at 49.60. Ponting has his most successful ODI season to date, scoring 462 runs at 57.75 in the annual tri-series, including a 100 against New Zealand and three fifties. The 100 was Ponting&#x27;s third ODI century, but Australia had lost all three matches. He scored 76 in the third and deciding final against South Africa, which Australia won. In a brief four-match ODI tour of New Zealand at the end of the season, Ponting scored 76 runs at 25.33.

===1998 tours of the subcontinent and Ashes===
Just 10 days after their tour of New Zealand, Australia played in a first-class warm-up match in India, ahead of their three match Test series. Sachin Tendulkar struck a double century in the opening warm-up match as the Australian bowlers struggled to cope with the conditions. Ponting came into the Test series with first-class scores of 53, 37 and 155 behind him. Batting at five and seven in the batting order respectively, he scored 18 in the first innings and two in the second on a &quot;dusty turning track&quot; in the opening Test in Chennai. Despite conceding a 71 first innings lead, Tendulkar struck 155 in India&#x27;s second innings, as India won by 169 runs. Australia suffered further humiliation in the second Test at Eden Gardens. India—whom amassed 5/633 in reply to Australia&#x27;s 233—went onto win by an innings and 16 runs, as Ponting scored 60 and nine.

Several days after the match, Ponting was thrown out of Equinox night club in Kolkata. The Indian media reported that Ponting was misbehaving with several women in the nightclub. Ponting was fined $1000 by Australian team management for the incident, and later apologised to staff. Ponting later wrote:

In the following Test in Bangalore, Australia won their first Test in India for 29 years, despite 177 not out from Tendulkar, which gave India a slender first innings lead. Ponting scored 16 his only innings as Australia won by eight wickets. He finished the series with 105 runs at 21.00 as the hosts took the Tests 2–1.

Despite a poor Test series, Ponting&#x27;s form in ODIs remained strong. In consecutive tournaments in India and Sharjah following the Tests, Ponting scored 467 runs at 51.88. In addition to three fifties, Ponting scored 145 from 158 balls in the Pepsi Cup against Zimbabwe in Delhi, equalling Dean Jones&#x27; Australian record.
Ponting also had his first confrontation with Harbhajan Singh, an Indian off spinner who went on to have much success against him. In the Coca-Cola Cup series ODI against India in April, he and Mark Waugh put on more than 80 runs in 12 overs before Harbhajan was introduced into the attack. In the spinners second over, Ponting took him for four then lofted him over mid-wicket for six next ball. The following delivery saw Ponting use his feet in an attempt to get to the pitch of the ball but missed the shot and was consequently stumped. After the dismissal the pair clashed verbally. Ponting wrote, &quot;The Sharjah incident was the result of me being over-competitive but it had the potential to get quite nasty. I was really disappointed with the shot I played [to get dismissed] and when I looked up Harbahjan was right in my face giving me the finger [gesturing for Ponting to leave the ground with his index finger] and really mouthing off. Had he been a few more metres away from me I would have not reacted like I did or at the most I would have given him a bit of lip as I walked past. I just over-reacted to the provocation.&quot; Both players were consequently fined ($500) and reprimanded by the match referee, with Harbhajan also suspended for a single ODI as he was adjudged to have breached the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct.

On the subsequent tour of Pakistan less than six months later, Ponting was dropped in favour of Darren Lehmann. The left-hander was perceived to be a better player of spin and a better prospect on the dry pitches of the Indian subcontinent than Ponting. In the first Test starting in October, Lehmann scored 98 in Rawalpindi, as Australia won their first Test in Pakistan in 39 years. Ponting&#x27;s only Test outing was in a high-scoring second Test draw in Peshawar, when he scored 76 not out and 43 as Lehmann was injured. The match saw Mark Taylor equal Don Bradman&#x27;s Australian record score of 334, when he declared Australia&#x27;s innings overnight on 4/599, despite being not out. Ponting was replaced by Lehmann for the final Test.

In between the Tests and the ODIs, Australia were knocked out of the 1998 Wills International Cup, starting in late October, when they were defeated by India in their opening match. In a knockout based tournament, Tendulkar scored 141 in India&#x27;s total of 307; meanwhile, Ponting managed a 53 ball 41, in a 44 run defeat. In a tournament hosted in Bangladesh, South Africa were eventual victors, defeating the West Indies in the final. He played in all the following ODIs against Pakistan, which Australia won 3–0. In the final match, Ponting scored 124 not out from 129 balls, as Australia chased down 316 with six wickets to spare. He finished the series with 215 runs at 107.50.

When the Australians returned for the home series against England, Ponting was &quot;in the worst run-scoring groove in his first-class career.&quot; Nevertheless, he was recalled in place of Lehmann, despite the latter&#x27;s form in Pakistan. This was explained on the basis of &quot;horses for courses&quot;; it was reasoned that Ponting would be more effective against England&#x27;s pace-oriented bowling attack. However, Ponting struggled in the first three Tests, scoring 47 runs at 11.75, and Lehmann regained his spot for the last two matches. He had played 22 Tests by the end of 1998, with 1,209 runs at an average of 36.63. Ponting was a permanent fixture in the ODI team throughout this period, and scored 322 runs at 46.00 during the Carlton &amp; United (CUB series) series of 1998–99.

During the CUB series, Ponting was involved in a fight outside a pub in Kings Cross, New South Wales, and earned a three match suspension from the national team. He sustained a black eye in the fight. Forced to front a media conference with the black eye, Ponting admitted that he had a &quot;problem with alcohol,&quot; and sought external help to attend to this problem. He also thought that his career was on &quot;thin ice&quot; and he had &quot;overstepped&quot; the mark, along with admitting that the episode may have ended his International captaincy aspirations.

==1999–2002: The road back to the Australian side==
Mark Taylor retired from international cricket on 2 February 1999, and was replaced by ODI captain Steve Waugh. Lehmann failed to make much impact in the final two Ashes Tests and was dropped for the 1998–99 tour of the West Indies, while Ponting was recalled. Ponting&#x27;s ability against pace-bowling helped his push for inclusion, as the West Indies typically relied entirely on pacemen. However, he was unable to force his way into the side in the first two tests, with number three, Justin Langer, and number six, Greg Blewett, cementing their places in the side. Before the third Test, Blewett suffered a hand injury and Ponting was recalled into the side. On a pitch that became increasingly flat throughout the day, Ponting—who came to the crease with the score at 4–144—joined Steve Waugh in a 281 partnership. After Waugh survived one of Ambrose&#x27;s &quot;more threatening spells&quot;, he scored 199 and Ponting 104. He &quot;batted with maturity and even temperament associated with the champions of the game&quot;, according to Waugh. Australia collapsed in their second innings to be bowled out for 146, with Ponting scoring 22. Left with a record run-chase in Barbados, the West Indies won by a single wicket, thanks to an unbeaten Brian Lara century. Australia had to win the Fourth and final Test in Antigua to retain the series, after going down 2–1. Ponting scored 21 and 21 not out in the match, as Australia won by 176 runs. The following seven-match ODI series was not a success for Ponting, scoring just 74 runs at 14.80 in five matches. The series was drawn at 3-all and included a tie.

===First World Cup success (1999)===
Australia started their 1999 World Cup campaign in England with success against minnows Scotland, before defeats by Pakistan and New Zealand. Ponting scored, 33, 47 and 49 respectively. After the twin defeats, pundits doubted whether Australia could make the semi-finals let alone win the tournament. Australia then defeated Bangladesh with 30 overs to spare, as Ponting batted out of his usual number three spot for the only time in the tournament. In an attempt to increase the run-rate with pinch hitter Brendon Julian, Ponting scored an unbeaten 18 from 10 balls at number four. Ponting scored 20, 23 and 36 in the following matches against the West Indies, India and Zimbabwe. In the last match of the Super Six stage of the tournament, Australia were to play South Africa in a match they needed to win to make the semi-finals. South Africa batted first and scored 271, before Australia slumped to 3/48. Steve Waugh joined Ponting in the middle and scored 22 runs in ten overs. Both then agreed increase the scoring in a mid-pitch conversation. South African all-rounder Jacques Kallis could not bowl because of strained abdominal muscles and the batting pair attacked the replacement bowlers, scoring 82 from 10 overs. They were involved in a 126-run stand until Ponting fell for 69 scored in 110 balls, including five fours and two sixes. Waugh went on to make 120 off 110 deliveries helping Australia win with two balls to spare. The sides met again in their next match, this time in the semi-final at Edgbaston on 17 June 1999. Australia only managed 213, with Ponting contributing a solid 37 from 48 balls. In reply, South Africa started strongly, talking 45 from the first nine overs without the loss of a wicket. However, Shane Warne dismissed Herschelle Gibbs and Gary Kirsten before long and eventually took 4/29 from 10 overs. The last over started with the Africans needing nine runs with one wicket in hand. Lower-order hitter, Lance Klusener, proceeded to score eight runs in the next two balls. Drama followed, as Donald was run-out two balls later, resulting in a tie. Australia qualified for the final because they finished higher than their opposition on the Super Six table. They comfortably accounted for Pakistan in the final, winning by eight wickets, after they were set a target of 132. Ponting scored 24 in Australia&#x27;s first World Cup win since 1987. He ended the tournament with 354 runs at 39.33.

Australia soon travelled to Sri Lanka for a three-Test series, which they lost 1–0. Ponting was one of Australia&#x27;s few effective players during the tour and was Man-of-the-Series, ending with 253 runs at 84.33. In the First Test defeat at Kandy, Ponting scored 96 and 51, almost half of Australia&#x27;s match total of 328 runs. They lost the match by six wickets, partly due to being unable to handle the spin of Muralitharan who took eight wickets. The Second Test was severely interrupted by rain and Ponting scored just one in his only innings. He scored 105 not out in the Third Test in Colombo, his only Test century in Sri Lanka. Despite having a perceived weakness against spin, Ponting played Muralitharan the best out of all the Australian batsmen. He scored 31 as Australia won their inaugural Test against Zimbabwe by nine wickets. In the following ODI series between the respective countries, Ponting scored 288 runs at 57.60 with two fifties.

Ponting started the 1999–2000 season poorly, with ducks in his first three Test innings in the series against Pakistan, including a pair on his home ground Bellerive Oval. He ended the run in style, scoring 197 in the Third Test at the WACA. Australia won the series 3–0 and Ponting proceeded to score 125 in the First Test against India at the Adelaide Oval. He finished with an unbeaten 141 in the Third Test at the SCG, the culmination of another Australian whitewash. Ponting was the leading scorer for the series, compiling 375 runs at 125.00. He brought this form into the initial stages of the following 1999–2000 Carlton United ODI series, hitting 32 and 115, before three consecutive ducks. Ponting, however, ended the rut towards the back end of the series, stringing together 53, 43, 33, 50 and 78, as Australia won the tournament. Along with his impressive average of 40.4, Ponting&#x27;s strike rate (87.06) was the highest of all recognised Australian batsmen. Perhaps more importantly, Ponting was selected as temporary vice-captain when Shane Warne was unavailable through injury, strengthening his claim for future higher honours. &quot;It&#x27;s now apparent to me that I&#x27;m one being viewed as a future Australia captain&quot;, Ponting acknowledged in his newspaper column. &quot;I think it&#x27;s fair to say unless I was being considered for a future leadership position in the team then someone with significantly more experience, like Mark [Waugh] would have been given the nod to be the team&#x27;s vice-captain. Despite all his good fortune, Ponting slid into the boundary fence and seriously damaged his ankle during the second final against Pakistan, forcing him to miss the upcoming ODI series&#x27; in New Zealand and South Africa. The damaged ligaments required a two-hour operation, with doctors telling him how he would not be able to return to cricket until the next summer. He recovered quicker than expected and by May he returned to the golf course and was given approval to start cricket training. He returned to the international scene in August for a three-match ODI series against South Africa in Melbourne&#x27;s indoor Docklands Stadium. He made only 60 runs, as the series was tied 1–1, with a tie.

Ahead of the first Test of the 2000–01 season in November, Ponting found form while playing for Tasmania. He scored 233 against a strong Queensland bowling team that included Andy Bichel, Adam Dale and Ashley Noffke. The innings included 37 boundaries and four sixes, and was so dominant, the next highest score for the innings was 61. In the second and final first-class match Ponting played for Tasmania in the season, he scored a more sedate 187 against New South Wales in Hobart, assuring him a place in the Test side, despite Damien Martyn (who replaced Ponting in the side when injured) scoring two centuries for Western Australia. Ponting was overlooked the ODI vice-captaincy, with Gilchrist given the role; however, Ponting captained a Northern Territory XI against the West Indies in the lead-up to the upcoming series. Though not known for extravagant claims, Steve Waugh told a journalist that Ponting could easily be the best batsman in the world, and put him alongside Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara. When Jamie Cox was selected for Australia A, Ponting was selected as captain of Tasmania for a domestic one-dayer against Victoria in December. His men won by nine wickets, with Ponting scoring an unbeaten 64 from 69 balls. Australia white-washed the West Indies 5–0 in the Test series; Ponting scored a modest 242 runs at 40.33, with a high score of 92.

===Defeat in India and 2001 Ashes===

Injury aside (he missed a three-Test tour of New Zealand in early 2000 after hurting his ankle in a fielding mishap in an ODI Final at Sydney), his position was now secured. Australia toured India in between February and April for three Tests and five ODIs. Australia had not won a Test series in India since 1969. Australian captain Steve Waugh began calling this the &quot;Final Frontier&quot;. Australia lost the series 2–1 after winning the first Test, and Ponting finished with just 17 runs at an average of 3.4. He was dismissed all five times by Harbhajan Singh. Ponting had a habit of instinctively rocking onto the front foot and thrusting his wrists at Harbhajan&#x27;s deliveries and was frequently caught in the bat pad positions because of this.

Despite this recent run of poor scores, Ponting was promoted to the key No. 3 position in the Australian batting order at the expense of the dropped Justin Langer, while Damien Martyn took Ponting&#x27;s former spot at No. 6, for the very next Test series, the 2001 Ashes tour of England. Ponting began the series poorly, scoring 11, 14, 4, 14 and 17—the first four dismissals all to Darren Gough. In the first innings of the fourth Test, Ponting stood his ground while on 0 after edging to slips and refused to go off the field without a TV replay. Replays revealed that the ball had been grassed and Ponting subsequently went on to score 144 and 72 in the second innings. He scored his 216 runs in only 226 balls. In doing so, he repeated his feat in 1997 of returning to form at Headingley. He ended the series with 338 runs at 42.25. Starting with that 2001 Ashes series he has batted No. 3 in all but four of his Test innings.

The touring New Zealanders were not expected to provide much of a challenge to the in-form Australians during the three-match Test series starting in November. The opening Test in Brisbane, saw the tourists came within 11 runs of victory, before the Test was drawn; partly to do with inclement weather. Ponting scored five and a run-a-ball 32 not out in Australia&#x27;s second innings, as they pushed for a declaration. After scoring 4, 0 and 0 in his previous Test outings at Bellerive Oval, Ponting broke through with a man-of-the-match performance of 157 not out in the Second Test, before further rain resulted in another draw. The result of the Third Test in Perth was no different, with Ponting scoring 31 and 26. Set a record 440 to win, Australia finished on 7/381 at stumps on the final day, despite half-centuries from Gilchrist and the Waugh twins. He ended the Test season 366 runs at 52.28.

==2002–2004: Appointment as One Day International captain==

===Appointment as One Day International captain===

Although the Test team had continued to perform well, sweeping South Africa 3–0 in the home series in 2001–02, the One-Day International (ODI) team suffered a slump, failing to qualify for the finals of the triangular tournament, leading to the dropping of Steve Waugh from the one-day team in February 2002. Ponting was elevated to the captaincy, ahead of then vice-captain Adam Gilchrist. The fortunes of the ODI team revived immediately, and Ponting&#x27;s men won their first series during the tour of South Africa, defeating the team that had won the tournament which ended Waugh&#x27;s reign.

Following his elevation to the ODI captaincy, Ponting played a prominent role in the Test tour of South Africa. He scored 100 not out to steer Australia to a four-wicket win in the Second Test in Cape Town, bringing up the winning runs with a six from the bowling of Paul Adams. He struck 89 in the Third Test and ended the series with 308 runs at 77.25 with a strike rate of 76.48. Australia entered the seven-match ODI series without both of the Waugh twins.

Ponting was prominent in the 3–0 whitewash of Pakistan on neutral territory in late 2002. He struck 141 in the First Test in Colombo and 150 in the Third Test in Sharjah to end with 342 runs at 85.50.

===2002–03 Ashes victory and first World Cup success as captain===

England toured for the 2002–03 Australian season, and Ponting struck 123 in the First Test in Brisbane. His form continued with 154 in the Second Test in Adelaide, meaning that he had scored four centuries in five Tests. Australia won the latter match by an innings and Ponting scored 68 in the Third Test in Perth as Australia took an unassailable 3–0 lead. He was unable to pass fifty in the final two Tests and ended the series with 417 runs at 52.12. Australia won the VB series held between and after the Tests. After the conclusion of the Third Test, Australia&#x27;s 30-man squad for upcoming 2003 World Cup was announced. Steve Waugh was a somewhat surprising omission, despite being unable to force his way back into the ODI team since being dropped after team disappointment in the 2001–02 VB Series. Ponting scored a slow 18 from 30 deliveries in Australia&#x27;s victory in the opening match of the 2002–03 VB series against England in Sydney. He proceeded to score 119 from 123 balls (nine fours and three sixes) in Australia&#x27;s second match of the series—again against England, this time at the MCG—sharing an all wicket record Australian ODI partnership of 225 with Adam Gilchrist in the process. Despite a comfortable Australian victory, Warne dislocated his right shoulder while diving to stop a ball. The success continued through the 2002–03 ODI series in Australia. Winning the finals series against England 2–0.

Australia hit trouble on the personnel front in the lead up to the World Cup. Lehmann was handed a seven-match ban for racial abuse, the world&#x27;s number 1 ranked ODI batsman Michael Bevan was injured, as was all rounder Shane Watson, who had to withdraw from the World Cup. At the time, another all-rounder, Andrew Symonds, had been performing poorly and had been heavily maligned by cricket analysts, but Ponting strongly advocated his inclusion. The selectors granted Ponting his wish, although the decision was considered highly controversial, especially with Waugh campaigning for his recall as an all-rounder.

A few days before the tournament started, Australia were in further turmoil, when leading bowler Shane Warne was sent home after failing a drugs test, and a replacement could not be flown in until after the first match. With Bevan and Lehmann still sidelined, Australia went into their opening match with little choice over their line-up, and Symonds having to play. However, Symonds repaid Ponting&#x27;s faith with an unbeaten 140 after Australia lost three quick wickets to be in early trouble. Australia beat Pakistan, and gained further momentum by defeating India by nine wickets in less than half their allotted overs in the next match. Symonds continued to put in a series of match-winning performances and continued to be strongly backed by Ponting from then on. Ponting himself performed solidly with 53 against Pakistan and 24 not out, hitting the winning runs to guide Australia home.

He failed to perform in the rest of the group matches including just 2 against Namibia and 18 against England in a poor performance which Australia managed to win just. He began the Super Six stage with a massive 114 against Sri Lanka. This innings included 4 sixes and he was very aggressive. He failed in the rest of the Super Six stage and the semi-final against the same opposition (Sri Lanka). In the Final, they met India, who they had crushed in the group stage. Indian captain Sourav Ganguly controversially sent the Australians in to bat, citing cloud cover, but Ponting&#x27;s batsmen attacked immediately and put the Indian bowlers under pressure. They went on to score 359–2, a record for a world cup final by over 100 runs. Ponting top-scored with a brilliant 140 not out from 121 balls. India&#x27;s batsmen could not cope with the target, and were defeated by a record (for World Cup Final matches) 125 runs. &quot;I have had some amazing times and some proud moments in my career, but the events at the Wanderers have topped the lot. Lifting the World Cup alongside 20 other proud Australians ... [It is] without doubt the best moment of my cricketing life.&quot; Ponting led his team to a dominant, undefeated, performance in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, winning all 11 of their matches.

Ponting was announced as long-term vice-captain in place of Adam Gilchrist for Australia&#x27;s away series in the Caribbean starting in April 2003. The first Test was not the first time Ponting had been vice-captain of the Australian Test team however, as he was thrust into the role against the West Indies in 2000 and England in 2001—because of injuries to Steve Waugh. Although Gilchrist had not done anything untoward, Ponting was elevated because Australian selectors wanted him to captain if Waugh was to be injured. This was Ponting&#x27;s third tour to the Caribbean, and he was rested from the only warm-up match ahead of the Tests. Nevertheless, he continued his World Cup form in the First Test, scoring 117 and 42 not out on a slow and low pitch, as Australia won by nine wickets. Ponting scored his first double century (206) in the Second Test, as he and Darren Lehmann shared an Australian third-wicket partnership record of 315 against a weak bowling attack. Australia defeated the West Indies by 118 runs on the final day—retaining the Frank Worrell Trophy. The Tasmanian&#x27;s rich vein of form continued in the Third Test, after being rested for a tour match against Barbados. He scored 113 before running himself out, as Australia batted first on a pitch at the Kensington Oval described as the slowest Waugh had played on. Waugh&#x27;s men proceeded to take a 3–0 series, with a comfortable nine-wicket victory. Ponting missed the final Test, as Australia conceded the Test record run chase of 418; nevertheless, Ponting was still awarded the man-of-the-series award, after ending the series with 523 runs at 130.75.

===5,000 Test runs===
Ponting then scored 10 and 59 as Australia recorded comfortable innings victories in their inaugural series against Bangladesh, played in Darwin and Cairns in the tropical north of Australia in the winter of 2003. In the third and final match of the ODI series following the Tests, Ponting scored a composed century, as he and Michael Bevan put on a run-a-ball 127-run stand.

Australia&#x27;s cricket summer started in October; a month earlier than usual because of their ODI series in India following their home series against Zimbabwe. Due to the season&#x27;s early start, many of the Australian players were not match fit. McGrath missed the series with an ankle injury, while there were concerns about whether Australia should be playing Zimbabwe because of Robert Mugabe&#x27;s regime. The first Test started on 9 October in Perth, as Australia started strongly batted first against a Zimbabwean bowling attack that lacked penetration on a flat WACA wicket. However, Ponting was dismissed leg before wicket for 37, while Hayden went on to break Brian Lara&#x27;s world record Test score of 375. Australia won the Test by an innings and 175 runs on the final day. In the next Test at the SCG Australia fielded an inexperienced team due to injuries and won by nine wickets; sweeping the series 2–0. Ponting struck 169 and 53 not out, and passed 5,000 Test runs during his first innings century. The Australian number three ended the two-match series with 259 runs at 129.50. In the midst of the lack of public attention and poor crowds, Ponting wrote how he was unsure whether Bangladesh and Zimbabwe should be playing Test cricket.

Australia flew to India two-day after the conclusion of the Zimbabwean series to play in the TVS Cup against India and New Zealand. They opened their campaign on 26 October against India in Gwalior, but were defeated by 37 runs, as Ponting was dismissed for two. Australia played New Zealand in match three of series in Faridabad. An early 9 am start saw New Zealand bowled out for 97, despite Australia bowling 17 wides. Australia comfortably reached the target, losing only two wickets in the process; one of which was Ponting for 12, who felt that he was &quot;in terrible form.&quot;. Before Australia&#x27;s next game, Ponting was named the Wisden International Cricketer of the Year in an award ceremony in Mumbai. Two days later, the city saw Australia defeat India by 77 runs, helped by Ponting&#x27;s 31. He continued his run without a large score, managing just 16 in the fifth match of the series against New Zealand; however, Australia won a hard-fought contest. He regained his form in a victory over New Zealand in match—scoring 52 in Guwahati. Ponting improved further against India in match eight in Bangalore. After Gilchrist scored his first ODI century against India, Ponting scored an unbeaten 108 from 103 balls, to help Australia win by 61 runs. Ponting hit seven sixes and one four, becoming the first batsman to end up with only one four in an ODI century. Ponting struggled to come to terms with the pitch early, reaching his 50 in 69 balls, before scoring his next 50 in 31 deliveries. After defeating New Zealand, India qualified for the final against Australia. Batting first in Kolkata, Australia managed 5/235, as Ponting scored 36. India were bowled out for 198, leaving Australia victors by 37 runs. He finished the series with 296 runs—the third highest run-scorer—at an average of 42.83.

===Most runs by an Australian in a calendar year (2003)===
After making 54 and 50 in the rain-drawn First Test in Brisbane, Ponting scored double-centuries in back-to-back Tests against India, in the Second Test at Adelaide (242) and at Melbourne (257, his career high). He hit 31 not out in the second innings in Melbourne as Australia levelled the series 1–1 and scored 25 and 47 in the drawn Fourth Test in Sydney to end as the leading run-scorer for the series, with 706 runs at 100.85. Harbhajan had been sent home after the First Test with an injury to his spinning finger.

Having also scored 206 at Port-of-Spain earlier in the year, he became only the second player (Sir Donald Bradman the other) to hit three double-centuries in a calendar year. Ponting&#x27;s 242 against India at Adelaide is also the highest ever Test score by a batsman whose team was subsequently defeated in the match.
After Steve Waugh&#x27;s retirement at the beginning of 2004 following the drawn home series against India, Ponting assumed the Test captaincy. Since 1997 the Australian team has not always had the same captain for Tests and for ODIs, with Mark Taylor and Steve Waugh being dropped from the ODI team whilst still the Test captain.

==2004–2008: Appointment as Test captain==

Ponting started with a 3–0 clean sweep of the Test series in Sri Lanka. Ponting brought Symonds into the Test team on the back of strong ODI form, rather than first-class cricket, replacing Simon Katich, who had scored a century and unbeaten fifty in the last Test. However, this backfired and Symonds was dropped after two Tests. Nevertheless, it was a far cry from Australia&#x27;s last two Test campaigns in Sri Lanka, which had resulted in a 1–0 and 0–1 results respectively. Individually though, Ponting struggled, especially in comparison to his efforts in 1999. He scored 198 runs at 33.00, his only effort beyond 30 being 92 in the first innings of the Third Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground in Colombo.

Australia hosted Sri Lanka for two Tests during the winter, in the tropical north. Ponting missed the victory in the First Test in Darwin due to a family bereavement, and scored 22 and 45 as the Second Test in Cairns was drawn.

Despite their success at World Cups, Australia continued their failure to win the ICC Champions Trophy. They were knocked out by hosts England in the semifinals in 2004.

After missing most of the tour of India due to injury, Ponting returned for the Fourth Test. By this time, Australia had taken an unassailable 2–0 series lead, his deputy Gilchrist leading the tourists to their first Test series win in India since 1969–70. Leading spinner Shane Warne injured himself on the eve of the match, which was played on a very dry pitch at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Off spinner Nathan Hauritz and leg spinner Cameron White, who were not regular wicket-takers in domestic cricket, were surprise selections ahead of Stuart MacGill for the tour. The reasoning given by the selectors was that as they intended to play only one spinner—Warne—MacGill was unlikely to play so they would not lose anything by taking some young spinners instead, in order to gain experience. However, it was too late for MacGill to be flown in, and Hauritz played and took 5/103. Ponting made 11 and 12 and Australia lost a low-scoring match in less than two days&#x27; equivalent playing time. Ponting was very vocal in criticising the playing surface after the match.
Ponting oversaw a successful campaign in the 2004–05 Australian season. They won all five Tests, defeating New Zealand 2–0 and Pakistan 3–0. Ponting scored 145 runs at 72.50 against New Zealand in a winning start to his Test captaincy on home soil. For his performances in 2004, he was named as captain of both the World Test XI and ODI XI by ICC.

Up to this point, Ponting&#x27;s prolific form with the bat in 2003 had tapered away following his ascension to the captaincy and he had not made a century in eight Tests, a long period by his standards. In the First Test against Pakistan in Perth, Ponting made 98 in the second innings. Australia went on to crush the visitors by over 400 runs. Ponting struck 62 not out in the second innings as Australia won by nine wickets in the Second Test in Melbourne, and then brought up his maiden century as captain, scoring 207 in the New Year&#x27;s Test in Sydney, which ended in another convincing nine-wicket triumph. He ended the series with 403 runs at 100.75.

Australia then won a three-Test tour against New Zealand away 2–0. Ponting ended the series in style, scoring 105 and 86 not out in the Third Test win in New Zealand. In his first Test series in the country, he scored 293 runs at 97.66.

===Australia lose an Ashes series for the first time since 1987===

Australia lost to England 2–1 after starting the series as favourites. Ponting thus became the first Australian captain since Allan Border in 1986–87 to lose an Ashes series. The 2005 series was hailed as one of the great Test series, but Ponting faced significant criticism afterwards and his tenure as captain was questioned. In his defence, Ponting said that Australia had simply been outplayed and had not stepped up at crucial moments in the matches. He rejected suggestions that Shane Warne should be captain in his stead.

After the first two matches the score was 1–1, having lost Glenn McGrath during the warm-up at Edgbaston and falling short of victory by just 3 run. England had the upper hand throughout the third Test at Old Trafford, where Australia needed to bat through the last day to force a draw. Ponting scored 156, the first Australian century of the series, and was dismissed only four overs from the end of the day. This left Australia nine wickets down but their final pair survived the remaining overs. In the fourth Test at Trent Bridge, Australia again batted poorly and was forced to follow-on. In the second innings, Ponting was well set on a score of 48, and England was in some difficulty due to an injury to key paceman Simon Jones, when the Australian captain was run out by a direct hit from the substitute fielder (Gary Pratt). Ponting reacted angrily, directing an abusive tirade at the English support team in the pavilion concerning the liberal use of substitutes as he walked into the Australian rooms. England had routinely used substitutes so that their bowlers could receive massages between their spells, but in this case, Pratt was on the field due to an injury to Jones, who had been taken to hospital and would go on to miss the fifth and final Test match of the series. Ponting was later fined 75% of his match fee by the match referee.

Australia went on to lose the match, despite a spirited fightback with the ball on the last day. Also in this match Ponting bowled six overs, and took his first wicket since March 1999; Michael Vaughan caught behind by Adam Gilchrist. The Fifth Test at The Oval was curtailed by rain and although Australia had the English batsmen in danger on the final day, a rearguard counterattacking partnership by Kevin Pietersen and Ashley Giles on the final afternoon secured a draw for the hosts. Thus, the Ashes were lost for the first time in 16 years.

The setback to Australia, and to Ponting as Australian captain, of the 2005 Ashes defeat, was to prove a strong motivation for the Australian camp to improve their standards and overcome any complacency that may have arisen from Australia&#x27;s being the world&#x27;s premier cricketing nation for a decade. Prior to the Ashes defeat, Australia&#x27;s dominance had prompted the ICC to organise a series against a World XI, immediately after the Ashes. Following the Ashes defeat, Australia were expected to struggle against the World XI, but bounced back to whitewash them 3–0 in the ODIs; they also won the only Test easily, Ponting scoring 46 and 54. However, the series was also criticised due to the apparent lack of collective desire of the World XI, who were regarded more as a collection of individuals.

===Twin centuries in 100th Test===

Australia were untroubled during the 2005–06 home season—whitewashing the West Indies 3–0 before defeating South Africa 2–0 in three Tests. They then toured South Africa and recorded a 3–0 whitewash in the Tests. In the series against the West Indies, Ponting scored a century in each innings of the First Test in Brisbane, 149 and 104 not out. In his first Test as captain in front of the Tasmanian public, Ponting managed 17 and 0 not out, and he ended the series with 329 runs at 82.25.

Ponting was in a rich vein of form against the South Africans. After scoring 71 and 53 in the drawn First Test in Perth, Ponting scored 117 on Boxing Day in the Second Test at the MCG. Australia won the match and Ponting scored 120 and 143 not out to end the series and start the New Year with a dramatic win in the Third Test at the SCG. South African captain Graeme Smith declared on the final morning of a rain-curtailed match and tried to open up the game in a bid to equal the series. He left Australia a target of 287 runs in 76 overs, and Ponting made 143 not out in only 159 balls to secure an eight-wicket win. It was the first time anyone had scored two centuries in their 100th Test and Ponting was named man of the match and man of the series. He had scored 515 runs at 103.00.

For his performances in 2005, he was named once again as captain of the World Test XI by ICC.

===Australia&#x27;s first Champions Trophy victory===
In 2005 Ponting began using cricket bats with a graphite covering over the wooden blade of the bat, as did other players contracted to Kookaburra Sport. This was ruled by the MCC to have contravened Law 6.1, which states that bats have to be made of wood, although they may be &quot;covered with material for protection, strengthening or repair not likely to cause unacceptable damage to the ball&quot;. Ponting and Kookaburra agreed to comply, before the series against South Africa.

Australia continued their run in South Africa even in the absence of McGrath for family reasons. Ponting scored 103 and 116 in the Second Test in Durban, making it three Test centuries in consecutive innings at the ground. He ended the series with 348 runs at 58.00. Remarkably his performance at Durban meant that Ponting had scored twin centuries in three separate Tests between November 2005 and March 2006, as part of 1192 runs at 79.5 in nine matches over the same period.

On 12 March 2006 Ponting scored 164 in only 105 balls in the 5th ODI against South Africa in Johannesburg, as Australia made a record total of 434 for 4, only to be beaten by South Africa&#x27;s 438 for 9. At the end of the match Ponting was jointly awarded Man of the Match with Herschelle Gibbs. Ponting was not happy with the performance and once in the dressing rooms delivered &quot;the biggest spray&quot; he hoped to do while captain of Australia.

The Australians moved on to their maiden Test tour of Bangladesh thereafter, and narrowly avoided an ignominious loss in the First Test at Fatullah. After the home side took an unexpected first innings lead, Ponting scored an unbeaten 118 in the second innings to guide his team to a three-wicket win. He scored 52 in the Second Test as Australia won by an innings and took the series 2–0.

Australia won the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy in India, finally winning the ODI tournament that had eluded them despite their World Cup success. After the final in Mumbai, Ponting drew some criticism for appearing to ask BCCI president and Indian cabinet minister Sharad Pawar to &quot;leave the podium&quot; and pointing towards the exit with his finger, while his teammate Damien Martyn pushed him gently in the back so that his team could commence celebrations. The issue, while minor, was solved when Ponting issued a formal apology to Pawar.

For his performances in 2006, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC. For his performances in 2006, he was named as captain of the World Test XI by ESPNcricinfo.

===Ashes regained and 10,000 ODI runs at 2007 World Cup===

In November 2006, the England cricket team again took on Australia in the first Test of a five Test series that was widely expected to be a tremendous contest between Australia, the top team on the world cricket rankings, and the England team, whose aggregated results over the last few years had it standing second in the rankings. Despite Australia this time having the advantage of playing on its own soil, the England team that had wrested the Ashes from the Australians was expected to be highly competitive.

In the First Test in Brisbane, Ponting top-scored in Australia&#x27;s first innings with 196 runs, and he followed this up with 60 not out in the second as Australia took the initiative with a commanding win. In the Second Test in Adelaide, Ponting top-scored with 142, helping Australia to a total of 513 in response to England&#x27;s 6/551. Australia went on to win the match by six wickets after a last day English collapse, Ponting making 49 in the chase. At the conclusion of the match, Ponting&#x27;s batting average peaked at 59.99. The Third Test played at the WACA Ground saw another win to Australia by 206 runs to reclaim the Ashes; Ponting made 2 and 75. The 15 months they had been in English hands was the shortest period either nation had held the urn. Further wins in Melbourne and Sydney, made Ponting&#x27;s team the second team (after Warwick Armstrong&#x27;s Australian team in 1920–21) to win an Ashes series 5–0, and that against what had been thought to be a formidable team, the second strongest cricketing team in the world. Ponting was awarded Man of the Series for the 2006–07 Ashes series after scoring 576 runs at an average of 82.29 including 2 centuries and 2 half centuries. For his performances in 2006, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC.

Australia then started the ODI series well, qualifying in first place for the final. However, they stumbled and lost 2–0 to England in the finals. Ponting was then rested for the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy ahead of the World Cup, and in his absence, the Australians were whitewashed 3–0, leading to suggestions that his team had slumped just ahead of the most important ODI tournament in world cricket.

Australia left for St Vincent, Australia&#x27;s venue for its two warm-up matches against Zimbabwe and England on 28 February without Brett Lee because of ankle damage. In the first warmup game against Zimbabwe, Ponting scored just 2 in Australia&#x27;s 106 run victory. In Australia&#x27;s second and last warm up game, this time against England, Ponting again failed to make an impact, scoring just 7 before he was bowled by off-spinner Jamie Dalrymple.

Australia started its World Cup campaign with three group matches played at Warner Park, St Kitts. Ponting himself began successfully with an innings of 113 from 93 deliveries that included five sixes, as Australia were dominant in 203-run victory against Scotland. Despite scoring just 23 in the next match against the Netherlands, Australia still amassed 358 and proceeded to win by 229 runs. In their next match against South Africa, Australia amassed 377/6—their highest score in World Cups. Ponting also scored 91 from 91 balls, and became the seventh player to score 10,000 ODI runs. Despite South Africa being 160 without loss in the 21st over, they crumbled, losing 9 wickets for just 74 runs.
Australia comfortably qualified for the Super Eights with their first match played at the new Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua. Ponting stated that he was not very impressed with the outfield labelling it &quot;ridiculously sandy&quot;.
The Australian captain was run out when on 35, with his team amassing 322 mainly thanks to 158 from Hayden. In a match spread out over two days, Australia comfortably defeated the home side by 103 runs. In their next match, Australia come up against lowly Bangladesh in another rain interrupted affair. This time the match was shortened to 22 overs a side. In the end Australia won by 10 wickets with Ponting not getting a chance to bat. In their next match against England, again in Antigua, Ponting scored a half-century, guiding Australia to a seven-wicket victory.
After not getting a bat in Australia&#x27;s rout of Ireland in Barbados, Ponting steered Australia to victory in their next match against Sri Lanka in Grenada, with 66 not out. Grenada was again the venue for Australia&#x27;s final super eights match, this time against New Zealand. Again amongst the runs, Ponting produced a fluent 66 that included seven boundaries, with his team wrapping up their biggest victory of the tournament. With his men now firm favourites for the tournament, they again came up against South Africa in the semi-final. South Africa, who were reeling at 27/5, ended up setting Australia 150 to win. Although Ponting scored 22, Australia easily dispatched South Africa by 7 wickets. He was named as captain of the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; by ESPNcricinfo.

For his performances in 2007, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC and ESPNcricinfo.

===Sydney Test controversy===
The 2007–08 started a new era for Australia, as McGrath and Warne had both retired at the end of the previous Ashes series. The pair had taken more than 1250 Test wickets between them, and the only three Test defeats that Australia had suffered under Ponting, once against India in Mumbai in 2004 and the two against England in 2005, had all occurred when one of the two were injured. Now that both had gone, critics wondered whether Australia and Ponting could maintain their success with their two main strike weapons absent. Australia had not played a Test since the Ashes, while being involved in 32 ODIs and eight Twenty20 Internationals. The period started well for Australia; winning the first Test against Sri Lanka in Brisbane by an innings and 40 runs. Ponting struck 56 from 84 balls (seven fours) in Australia&#x27;s total of 551. The Second Test in Hobart, saw Ponting score 31 (66 balls) and 53 not out (2 fours and a six) in front of his home crowd, as Australia wrapped up the series 2–0. Ponting scored 140 runs at 70 and took three catches. For his performances in 2007, he was named as captain once again in the World Test XI by ICC.
However, the series against India was much harder-fought. Australia won the First Test easily, by 337 runs, but the matches thereafter were more difficult. The Second Test was closely fought and ended in Australian victory minutes before the end of play. This saw Australia equal the world record of 16 consecutive Test wins; Ponting, was part of Steve Waugh side that set the previous record in 1999–2001. However, the cricket was overshadowed by player conduct issues.

After the match ended the stadium erupted in cheering as the Indians walked off the field, and the Australians celebrated their record-equalling win. The Australian team did not shake hands with Indian players on the field, especially Kumble who was waiting there after the fall of the final wicket. Though the Australian and Indian teams shook hands before heading into the dressing rooms later, but Kumble, who was batting at the end of the match, showed his displeasure by not shaking hands with the umpires. India expressed their resentment by boycotting the post-match presentation ceremony.
In the post-match press conference, Anil Kumble summed up his view of the game by stating, &quot;Only one team is playing in the spirit of the game&quot; – a statement that alluded to Australian captain Bill Woodfull&#x27;s leaked private admonishment of English manager Sir Pelham Warner during the 1932–33 Bodyline series. Chetan Chauhan, India&#x27;s team manager said his players were &quot;agitated and upset by... the incompetent umpires here... [and hoped] that they will not officiate again in the series&quot;. Ponting was questioned over the wrong decision, the racism row, and especially the wicket of Ganguly during which he held his finger up to indicate to Mark Benson that Ganguly has been caught. Ponting was aggressive towards the Indian journalists, lashing out at them for &quot;questioning my [Ponting&#x27;s] integrity&quot;. The Australian players faced much questioning as a result of the fallout of the incident. The Australian team maintained that they play hard but fair. In regards to the racism issue, Ponting denied he did anything wrong by singularly reporting Harbhajan Singh for being abusive. Ponting stated that he was obligated to refer any incidents of racism to officials as it is widely agreed that racism is unacceptable anywhere in the world. After criticism of the Australian team in multiple media continued, a shocked Ponting promised to ensure that his side&#x27;s conduct is not seen to be arrogant in future matches. Peter Roebuck, a columnist in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, branded Ponting as &quot;arrogant&quot; and insisted that be stripped of the captaincy.

In the early part of the Test series against India, Ponting continued to struggle against Harbhajan, falling to him three consecutive times in the first two Tests. On the third occasion, Ponting was again caught at bat pad, from the first ball that Harbhajan bowled to him, prompting the bowler to celebrate raucously. Harbhajan missed the Third Test and upon his return in the fourth Test, Ponting broke through for his first Test century against India in matches involving Harbhajan, scoring 140. However, the second half of the series was less successful for Australia as a team; India won the Third Test, ending the Australian streak, and the Fourth Test was a high-scoring draw. The Adelaide Test aside, Ponting had an otherwise unproductive season, scoring 268 runs at 38.28.

In the Commonwealth Bank series, Ponting struggled until Australia&#x27;s last round robin match against India where he and another poor performing Australian batsmen, Andrew Symonds put on a 100 run partnership with Ponting making a hundred and Symonds making 50. Australia won two of their three-round robin matches against the Indians, but the tables were turned in the finals, which the tourists won 2–0.

===Third Australian to score 10,000 Test runs===
The tour of the West Indies was the first overseas Test series for Australia in 25 months, and the first for Ponting&#x27;s new look bowling attack. In five previous Test series in 1999 and 2003, he averaged 98.71, with four hundreds. He also averaged 42.80 in 25 ODIs from four tours—1995, 1999, 2003 and the 2007 World Cup. After eight months of consecutive cricket from the World Twenty20, Ponting was surprised about how good he was feeling, despite believing that he would be weary from the amount of cricket he had played.
In the only warm up match before the series—against a Jamaican XI, the Australians drew controversy from various sections of the media as they chose to wear a sponsors cap over the traditional Baggy Green cap. This was because wicket–keeper Brad Haddin did not want to receive a Baggy Green as he was yet to play in a Test. The rest of the team decided they wanted to look uniform although they wore their Baggy Greens in Jamaica&#x27;s second innings. Ponting scored 17 in the first innings and 20 not out in the second, as a storm prevented an Australian victory.

After winning the toss and electing to bat in the First Test in Kingston, Jamaica, Ponting recorded his 35th Test century and was eventually dismissed for 158 from 224 balls. Despite forcing their way back into contention, the West Indies were defeated by 95 runs. In the Second Test, Ponting became the seventh player and third Australian to score 10,000 Test runs. It took Ponting 118 Tests and 196 innings to achieve the feat, one slower than Tendulkar and Lara. He was dismissed in the following over for 65. Ponting scored 38 in Australia&#x27;s second innings, as the match ended in a draw. Australia won the third Test, and the Australian captain ended the series with 323 runs at 53.83. Although Australia won the three–Test series handsomely, with a 2–0 margin, they were to face stronger opposition overseas, in the next year. Difficulties were also beginning to appear in the spin department. MacGill, who had taken over 200 wickets in his career despite playing only sporadically due to the presence of Warne, suffered a loss of form and decided to retire during the series. Brad Hogg, the regular ODI spinner had also retired prior to the series, and Beau Casson made his debut in the final Test.

After not batting in Australia&#x27;s Twenty20 loss in Bridgetown, Ponting was rested for the List A 50-over game against the University of West Indies Vice Chancellor&#x27;s XI. He returned for the first three ODIs and scored just 87 runs at 29.00, notching up his 300th ODI during the 2nd match. Ponting scored 69 in the third match, before returning home because of a wrist injury. Under the captaincy of Michael Clarke in the final two games, Australia swept the series 5–0.

==2008–2011: Decline in form==

===Mixed team performances===

In 2008, Ponting led the Australians back to India and was under pressure following the confrontations during the Indian tour of Australia earlier in the year. He acknowledged that he was keen to rectify his poor Test batting record in India. In the First Test on a turning pitch in Bangalore, Ponting brought up his first Test century in India, 123 on the first day, although he eventually fell leg before wicket to Harbhajan. Australia had the hosts seven wickets down in their first innings, still more than 320 runs in arrears, but India recovered to salvage a draw after a rearguard effort.

In the Second Test in Mohali. Australia were defeated by 320 runs and Ponting was criticised for using part-timer bowlers against the free-scoring Indian batsmen in the second innings, because of a slow over-rate, which is can be penalised by a fine, or in severe instances, a ban to the captain. This meant that he was not able to use pace spearhead Brett Lee significantly.

The Third Test in Delhi saw a flat pitch, where India scored 7/613 in its first innings in which Ponting resorted to bowling himself for two overs. Ponting amassed 87 in Australia&#x27;s first innings score of 577. The match ended in a draw and Australia needed to win in the Fourth Test in Nagpur to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. On the fourth afternoon of the Fourth Test, the Indian batting collapsed, and Australia had an opportunity to bowl them out and chase a target of around 250–300 after the tea break. However, the Australians were a long way behind on their over rate, so in order to avoid a one match suspension, Ponting chose to bowl their part-time spinners and medium pacers such as Michael Clarke, Cameron White and Mike Hussey (who were all unsuccessful in capturing a wicket), as they took less time. In the meantime, captain MS Dhoni and Harbhajan both added half centuries. This drew strong criticism from many commentators, who suggested that their faster bowlers, who had been responsible for the collapse, could have bowled from a shorter run-up. When the fast bowlers were reintroduced, the last four wickets fell quickly. This left Australia chasing 382 runs for victory and they lost by 172 runs to cede the series 2–0. In the first innings, Ponting became Harbhajan&#x27;s 300th Test wicket and the Australian captain ended the series with 264 runs at 37.71. While below his career standards, it was substantially better than his previous Test efforts in India.

Fined in India for a slow over rate, Ponting failed to redress the matter during the subsequent home series against New Zealand, when match referee Chris Broad dealt a second successive fine for being three overs behind in the First Test: Ponting was stripped of thirty per cent of his A$12,750 match fee, twice the punishment of his teammates in accordance with International Cricket Council rules for captains. Australia were largely untroubled by New Zealand, sweeping both Tests. Ponting scored only 100 runs at 33.33.
In the first Test against South Africa in Perth, starting in December, Ponting again had to reduce his reliance on his preferred pace bowlers, and rely more on spinners due to a slow over rate. His persistent problems with the over rate prompted some commentators to criticise him for spending too much time during the match conferring with bowlers. In the first innings he scored a duck, and managed 32 in Australia&#x27;s second innings. Ponting&#x27;s inexperienced attack had trouble dismissing the opposition batsmen, and South Africa made 4/414, the second highest successful runchase in history to win by six wickets on the final day.

Ponting experienced a form slump for much of 2008, albeit in comparison to his usually high standards. However, he again exceeded 1,000 runs in the calendar year. Ponting scored his 37th century in the first innings of the Second Test against South Africa on Boxing Day, and followed that with 99 in the second innings, seemingly a lone stand against the South African bowling attack. The tourists won the match by nine wickets to win the series. Australia thus lost their first home Test series since 1992–93. Australia lost the series 2–1, the first time South Africa had won a Test series against Australian since 1970, and the first on Australian soil. Ponting totalled 285 runs at 47.50 for the series.

With the retirement of experienced opening batsman Matthew Hayden—who was replaced by the uncapped 20-year-old Phillip Hughes—the Australian team that toured South Africa in February, March and April 2009 was its most inexperienced since the defections to World Series Cricket. This was further compounded by the loss of Andrew Symonds to injury, who was replaced by the uncapped Marcus North. The bowling attack also required major changes, due to the injuries to Brett Lee and Stuart Clark. Subsequently, paceman Mitchell Johnson was the only bowler with more than four Tests heading into the series. Of the First Test team, Hughes, North, Ben Hilfenhaus, Peter Siddle and Andrew McDonald had only five Tests between them, with the former three making their debut. Ponting&#x27;s team took the series 2–1, so Australia maintained their No. 1 Test ranking. Ponting was praised for cobbling together an unexpected win, as South Africa were thought to be stronger on home soil. He scored eighties in the first two Tests, ending with 210 runs at 35.00.

For his performances in 2008, he was named as captain once again of the World ODI XI by the ICC.

===Second Ashes series loss as captain===
After losing their opening match of the 2007 World Twenty20 to Zimbabwe, Ponting&#x27;s men were looking for a more positive start to the 2009 edition in England. They opened their campaign in early June against a West Indian outfit that had recently been whitewashed 2–0 in the Test series against England. However, Ponting made a second ball duck in Australia&#x27;s seven wicket defeat. They played Sri Lanka in their next match, this time at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. Ponting hit five boundaries on his 25 before he was bowled trying the run-rate, before Sri Lanka won by six wickets. The defeat consequently eliminated Australia from the tournament.

In Australia&#x27;s two drawn warm-up matches ahead of the 2009 Ashes, Ponting struggled to adjust to the English conditions, somewhat, with a highest score of 71. Nevertheless, he started the Ashes series strongly, scoring 150 in the First Test in Cardiff. In his 38th hundred and eighth in an Ashes series, the Australian number three batsman became just the fourth man to score 11,000 runs in Test cricket. The match ended in a draw and Ponting drew criticism for failing to bowl fast-bowler Ben Hilfenhaus while England&#x27;s last-wicket pair of Monty Panesar and Jimmy Anderson were batting to save the match. Ponting could only manage two and 38, as Australia were defeated in the second Test at Lord&#x27;s—their first Test defeat at the venue since 1934. On 31 July, during the Third Test at Edgbaston, Ponting became the highest Australian run-scorer in the history of Test cricket, overtaking former Australian captain Allan Border&#x27;s total of 11,174 in his first-innings score of 38. The match was eventually drawn, partly due to poor weather.
Australia went on to lose the series 2–1 and Ponting became only the third Australian captain to lose the Ashes twice. Despite not being a selector, Ponting was heavily criticised for Australia not playing Hauritz and his apparent reluctance to put faith in his spinners. He was questioned, particularly on Australia&#x27;s recent habit of often not playing a specialist/regular spinner. Instances of these were the first three Tests in India, the omission of Krejza for the First Test against New Zealand immediately after taking 12 wickets on debut, and opting for no spinner in the first two Tests in South Africa.

On 7 September 2009, Ponting announced his retirement from Twenty20 international cricket in order to prolong his career. He was succeeded as Australian Twenty20 captain by team vice-captain Michael Clarke.

Australia came into the Champions Trophy ranked second in ODIs; along with being the events reigning champions. They opened their campaign against an undermanned West Indian outfit who were without prominent players because of an industrial dispute. On a &quot;lively pitch&quot;, Ponting top-scored with 79, after reaching his half-century in 63 balls. He hit opening bowler and future nemesis, Kemar Roach, for four boundaries in the seventh over of the match, and scored a six and two fours against the fast-bowler when he was reintroduced into the attack in the 21st over. The innings set up Australia&#x27;s comfortable 50-run victory. Australia next match against India was abandoned due to rain. Before the weather intervend Ponting had scored 65 from 85 deliveries, before being run out. The result meant Australia needed to defeat Pakistan in their third and final group match for a place in the semi-finals. Though Australia collapsed when Ponting was dismissed for a patient 32 in pursuit of low total they won by two wickets.

Australia defeated England by nine wickets in their semi-final, with Ponting scoring an unbeaten 111 from 115 deliveries (12 fours and one six); his 28th ODI century. During the innings, Ponting became the third batsman to score 12,000 ODI runs and was also involved in a record 252-run partnership with Watson—Ponting&#x27;s seventh double-century stand for Australia in the format; the only player to achieve this feat. Despite Ponting&#x27;s score of only one in the final in Centurion against New Zealand, Australia won by six wickets—their second consecutive Champions Trophy victory. Ponting was presented with the golden bat award for most runs in the tournament—288 at an average of 72 in four games—and also received the man-of-the-series award, before praising his young side for the title defence.

Australia proceeded to tour India for seven ODIs starting in mid-October and ending in early November. In the opening match, Ponting top-scored for Australia with 74 from 85 balls, as his team narrowly escaped defeat. Ponting made just 12 in India&#x27;s comprehensive victory in the second match, while he scored a slow 59 from 93 balls (four boundaries) in another Indian victory in the third match. The Australian captain stuck a more fluent innings of 52, scored in 59 deliveries in the following fixture. Australia amassed their biggest total of the series in the fifth match, with Ponting contributing a run-a-ball 45. A slow, low, turning wicket was presented to the teams for the sixth ODI in Guwahati. Ponting fought his way to 25 from 57 balls, before falling to Harbhajan, as Australia comfortably chased down India&#x27;s total of 170 with six wickets remaining. The final match in Mumbai was washed out after a cyclone formed over the Arabian Sea; securing a 4–2 series victory to the injury depleted Australians. &quot;It&#x27;s probably one of the best one-day series I have ever been involved in, with all the injuries and setbacks at the start of this tour&quot;, Ponting said. He ending the series with 267 runs at 44.50.

===Troubles against the short ball===

Leading West Indian batsmen Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul returned for the opening Test of the 2009–10 Australian cricket season starting on 26 November in Brisbane, after the industrial dispute was resolved. Ponting scored 55 in an Australian innings victory, before many sections of the media attacked the West Indies lack-lustre performance. Ponting produced scores of 35 and 20 in the following Test in Adelaide, as the touring side responded to their critics by securing a draw. For the first time since 2002, Ponting slid out of the top ten Test batting rankings—dropping to 12th—as Australia faced the prospect of falling to third in the team rankings if they were not able to achieve victory in the final Test of the series. Matters got worse for Ponting, as former Australian fast-bowler Rodney Hogg voiced that he should be sacked as captain and replaced with New South Wales leader Simon Katich. He said the team had become a &quot;boys club&quot; and was not preparing adequately for the future. However, former Australian Test opening batsman Justin Langer labelled Hogg&#x27;s comments as &quot;rubbish&quot;, something that was backed by Katich.

In the first innings of the Third and final Test, Ponting was immediately greeted with short pitched bowling. After mis-timing a pull-shot from Roach on his first ball, Ponting was struck on the elbow in the following delivery. After battling through obvious discomfort, Ponting eventually retired hurt on 23 from 25 balls—the only time he had taken such action in his international career. Nevertheless, he did manage to hit two fours and a six from short deliveries in Roach&#x27;s 12th over. Michael Clarke replaced Ponting at his number three batting position, as the Australia captain did not want to risk further damage to his elbow tendon injury ahead of the Boxing Day Test against Pakistan in Melbourne. Nevertheless, Australia collapsed and he eventually came to the wicket at number nine, with Australia at 7/125. The West Indian bowlers again bowled short deliverers to Ponting until he turned one such delivery to short-leg and was dismissed for two.

After spending time in a hyperbaric chamber to increase the speed of his recovery from the elbow injury, Ponting recovered sufficiently to play in the Boxing Day Test, the opening match of a three-Test series against Pakistan. Despite still being inconvenienced by the injury, he scored 57 at close to a run-a-ball, before being dismissed by another short pitched delivery for 12 in Australia&#x27;s second innings. The home side went on to win the match comfortably, and Ponting overtook Shane Warne&#x27;s record of 91 Test victories and surpassing Steve Waugh as crickets most successful Test captain. Ponting scored 853 runs at 38.77 in 13 Tests in 2009, and scored only one century and seven half-centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records / 2009 / Test matches / Most runs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, his ODI form was more convincing, topping the run-scoring list with MS Dhoni. His 1,198 runs were scored at an average of 42.78, including two centuries and nine half-centuries in 29 matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records / 2009 / One-Day Internationals / Most runs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ponting was criticised for choosing to bat on a green pitch for the Second Test. Australia were dismissed for 127, and Ponting was re-dismissed from a short ball, this time for a first-ball duck, and many sections of the media called for him to stop playing the hook and pull shots. He fell for only 11 in the second innings, and when Australia lost their eighth wicket, they were only just over 50 ahead. However, a 123-run ninth-wicket partnership between Michael Hussey and Peter Siddle rescued the home-side, helping them win by 36 runs. After being dropped on zero, Ponting scored his fifth double-century in the Third and final Test in Hobart. His innings helped Australia complete a 3–0 series victory.

In the following five ODIs, Ponting could not continue his Hobart form, scoring 125 runs at 25 in the series, boosted by a half-century in the final match; his performances improved in the five ODIs starting soon after against the West Indies. He was named man-of-the-series thanks to his 295 runs at 73.75, including two-half centuries and his 29th ODI century and first in Brisbane during the fourth match.

===2010–11 Ashes defeat===
Australia entered the 2010–11 Ashes series hoping to regain The Ashes from England on home soil as they had four years previously. The First Test in Brisbane was drawn after both sides posted large batting totals. Ponting was caught behind for 10 in the first innings and 51 not out in the second. A barren run followed in the subsequent three Tests, scoring 52 runs in total as Australia lost the series. Ponting became the first Australian captain to lose an Ashes series in Australia since Allan Border in 1987. During the Fourth Test Ponting was involved in an on-field argument with umpires, and was fined 40% of his match fee, which accounted to around $5,400. Ponting missed the Fifth Test due to a finger injury, and Michael Clarke stood in as Australia&#x27;s captain. Australia&#x27;s heavy defeat in the series and Ponting&#x27;s poor run of form caused his position in the team to be questioned. Former Australian captain Steve Waugh suggested dropping him down the batting order; others, such as former Australian batsman and South African captain Kepler Wessels, called for him to relinquish the captaincy to focus on his batting.

Yet, for his performances in 2010, he was named as captain of the World ODI XI by the ICC.

===2011 World Cup and resignation as captain===
Ponting retained the captaincy of Australia for the 2011 World Cup in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Australia had won the previous three World Cups and entered the tournament as the world&#x27;s top-ranked ODI team. Australia qualified for the quarter-finals, although Ponting failed to find form, scoring 102 runs in five innings during the group stage of the tournament. Australia met India in the quarter-finals and were defeated by five wickets. Ponting scored 104, his first century in international cricket in over a year. After being knocked out of the tournament, Ponting resigned his position as captain at both Test and ODI levels, endorsed Michael Clarke as his successor, and indicated his intention to continue playing.

==2011–2012: Post-captaincy==
In 2011, Ponting was inducted into Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) &#x27;Best of the Best&#x27;. He was selected in Michael Clarke&#x27;s teams for the tours of Sri Lanka and South Africa in 2011, scoring an important half-century (62) in the fourth innings of the second Test against South Africa in Johannesburg, helping Australia chase down a target of 310 to draw the series 1–1.

In the 2011–12 Australian summer, a disappointing series draw with New Zealand gave rise to calls for Ponting to be removed from the team following perceived underperformances. The selectors resisted the calls, selecting Ponting for the Boxing Day Test—the first of a four-Test series against India. Ponting scored two half-centuries in Australia&#x27;s first Test win, followed by a century (134) in Australia&#x27;s first innings of the second Test in Sydney. The century was his first in Test cricket in almost two years. His fourth-wicket partnership of 288 runs with Clarke, who went on to make 329 not out, set a new record for the biggest partnership by an Australian pair of batsmen against India. Australia sealed the series win by defeating India in Perth, and in the fourth Test in Adelaide, Ponting and Clarke beat their own record, putting on 386 runs. The partnership was the fourth highest to that point in Australian Test cricket. Ponting&#x27;s own score was 221. During the innings, he became only the third player and the first Australian (after Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, who were playing in the same match) to pass 13,000 career Test runs.

==2012: Test retirement==
On Australia Day 2012 he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia for services to cricket and, through the Ponting Foundation, the community. Ponting was promoted to captain in the 2011–12 Commonwealth Bank Series in Australia in Michael Clarke&#x27;s absence due to injury. However, after only two games as captain he was dropped, having scored only 18 runs in 5 games of the 2011–12 Commonwealth Bank Series. At a press conference thereafter, Ponting conceded, &quot;I don&#x27;t expect to play one-day international cricket for Australia any more and I&#x27;m pretty sure the selectors don&#x27;t expect to pick me either ... I will continue playing Test cricket and I&#x27;ll continue playing for Tasmania as well&quot;.

On 29 November 2012 Ponting announced that he would retire from Test cricket after the WACA test against South Africa.

==2013: Tasmania and Surrey==

After retiring from test cricket, Ponting played out the Sheffield Shield season with eventual champions Tasmania. He was the competition&#x27;s leading run scorer with 911 runs at an average of 75.91. As a result of his prolific form with the bat, he was named the Sheffield Shield player of the year.

He signed on to play for the English County side Surrey during June–July 2013. His score of 192 on debut against Derbyshire was the highest score by a Surrey batsman on their first class debut for the county. Ponting scored an unbeaten 169 against Nottinghamshire in his final first class innings, ensuring his team held on for a draw.

During the Ashes 2013, Ponting wrote a regular column for the Daily Mail.

At the formal opening of the Bellerive Oval redevelopment in January 2015, it was announced that the new Western Stand would be named the &quot;Ricky Ponting Stand&quot; in his honour. On 9 December 2015 Ponting also unveiled a bronze statue placed at the ground in his honour.

==Playing style==

===Approach to cricket===

Ponting was known as an aggressive competitor, as manifested in his on-field conduct. According to former Australian captain Allan Border, what you see with Ponting is what you get, and &quot;he wears his heart on his sleeve&quot;. Border also noted that Ponting has an abundance of determination, courage and skill.

However, his competitive attitudes could be overly aggressive, pushing the boundaries of cricket etiquette. In early 2006, in the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy, Ponting had an on-field argument with umpire Billy Bowden over signalling a no-ball because not enough players were within the inner circle. In mid-2006, during a tour of Bangladesh, Ponting was accused of &quot;badgering the umpires until he got what he wanted&quot;.

The South African captain, Graeme Smith, described Ponting as the toughest competitor he had ever played against.

===Batting===

Ponting was known as an aggressive right-handed batsman who played a wide repertoire of shots with confidence, most notably the pull and hook. However, he had some technical weaknesses, such as shuffling across his stumps and being trapped leg before wicket, and thrusting his bat away from his body—especially early in his innings, because he wants to move forward and across to drive rather than backwards and across to cut the ball. Despite being widely renowned as the best player of the hook and pull shots in the world, Ponting was equally adept on both the front and back foot. However, during the latter stages of his career, the hook and pull shots have often been the cause of his dismissal. He adopts a more traditional V-grip lower down the handle as he is a short batsman who doesn&#x27;t have natural power on the shot.

He was considered by some observers to have trouble against quality spin, especially against Indian off spinner Harbhajan Singh, who dismissed Ponting on 13 occasions in international cricket. Ponting had a tendency to rock onto the front foot and thrust his wrists at spinning deliveries, resulting in many catches close to the wicket. Ponting rarely employed the sweep shot against spin, something considered unusual for a top-order batsman. Instead, he looked to use his feet to come down the wicket to spinners, or play off the back foot through the off-side.
Former West Indian captain, Viv Richards, who was rated as the third best Test cricketer in a 2002 poll by Wisden, said Ponting was his favourite current-day player to watch, slightly ahead of Sachin Tendulkar.

===Bowling and fielding===
A right-arm medium bowler who tends to bowl off cutters or faster offspin, Ponting rarely bowled, although he has notably dismissed West Indian batsman Brian Lara in an ODI match and former England captain Michael Vaughan in an Ashes Test in 2005. He was also ceremoniously asked to bowl in his final test match against South Africa in 2012. He was, however, rated one of the best fielders in the world. He usually fielded in the slips, cover and silly point. His good eye and accurate throws often saw him run batsmen out with direct hits.

===Captaincy===

Ponting has often been criticised for his lack of imagination in his captaincy, though many players who played under him say he is a good leader. According to former Australian opening batsman Justin Langer, &quot;He is quite inspirational as a leader and I just never get all the detractors he has. Whether it&#x27;s in the fielding practice, the nets, the way he holds himself off the field—every time he speaks, these young guys just listen, they hang on every word he says.&quot;

&quot;Ponting captained 2 consecutive World Cup victories in 2003 and 2007 (out of Australia&#x27;s hat-trick of World Cups – 1999, 2003, 2007)&quot;

<text>Melody Maker was a British weekly music magazine, one of the world&#x27;s earliest music weeklies; according to its publisher, IPC Media, the earliest. In January 2001, it was merged into &quot;long-standing rival&quot; (and IPC Media sister publication) &quot;New Musical Express&quot;.

==1920s–1940s==
It was founded in 1926 by Leicester-born composer, publisher Lawrence Wright as the house magazine for his music publishing business, often promoting his own songs. Two months later it had become a full scale magazine, more generally aimed at dance band musicians, under the title &quot;The Melody Maker and British Metronome&quot;. It was published monthly from the basement of 19 Denmark Street (soon relocating to 93 Long Acre), and the first editor was the drummer and dance-band leader Edgar Jackson (1895-1967). 

Jackson instigated a jazz column, which gained in credibility once it was taken over by Spike Hughes in 1930. This was later developed into &quot;Jazz Corner&quot;, edited by Sinclair Traill and then Max Jones, one of the leading British proselytizers for jazz. There were regular reports on jazz happenings in the United States, and the magazine secured the first British interview with Louis Armstrong in July 1932 while he was over for a visit.

Odhams Press took over the magazine in 1928, and the format was changed to a 16 page weekly newspaper in 1933. Ray Sonin joined the staff in 1939, progressing to news editor and then 10 years as managing editor until 1951. Sonin subsequently joined the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;.

==1950s–1960s==

&quot;The Melody Maker&quot; (&quot;MM&quot;) was slow to cover rock and roll and lost ground to the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (&quot;NME&quot;), which had begun in 1952. &quot;MM&quot; launched its own weekly singles chart (a top 20) on 7 April 1956, and an LPs charts in November 1958, two years after the &quot;Record Mirror&quot; had published the first UK Albums Chart. From 1964, the paper led its rival publications in terms of approaching music and musicians as a subject for serious study rather than merely entertainment. Staff reporters such as Chris Welch and Ray Coleman applied a perspective previously reserved for jazz artists to the rise of American-influenced local rock and pop groups, anticipating the advent of music criticism.

On 6 March 1965, &quot;MM&quot; called for the Beatles to be honoured by the British state. This duly happened on 12 June that year, when all four members of the group (Harrison, Lennon, McCartney, and Starr) were appointed as members of the Order of the British Empire. By the late 1960s, &quot;MM&quot; had recovered, targeting an older market than the teen-oriented &quot;NME&quot;. &quot;MM&quot; had larger and more specialised advertising; soon-to-be well-known groups would advertise for musicians. It ran pages devoted to &quot;minority&quot; interests like folk and jazz, as well as detailed reviews of musical instruments.

A 1968 &quot;Melody Maker&quot; poll named John Peel best radio DJ, attention which John Walters said may have helped Peel keep his job despite concerns at BBC Radio 1 about his style and record selection.

Starting from the mid-1960s, critics such as Welch, Richard Williams, Michael Watts and Steve Lake were among the first British journalists to write seriously about popular music, shedding an intellectual light on such artists as Steely Dan, Cat Stevens, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and Henry Cow.

==1970s==
By the early 1970s, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was considered &quot;the musos&#x27; journal&quot; and associated with progressive rock. However, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; also reported on teenybopper pop stars such as the Osmonds, the Jackson 5, and David Cassidy. The music weekly also gave early and sympathetic coverage to glam rock. Richard Williams wrote the first pieces about Roxy Music, while Roy Hollingworth wrote the first article celebrating New York Dolls in proto-punk terms while serving as the &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s New York correspondent.

Andrew Means started writing for &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in 1970. During his time, he was prolific and had the responsibility of covering folk music. He was with the paper until 1973. He later wrote for &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;. He was also a freelancer and wrote for &quot;Sing Out!&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Jazziz&quot;, &quot;Rhythm&quot; and &quot;Songlines&quot; etc. In later years he was a fiction writer.

In January 1972, Michael &quot;Mick&quot; Watts, a prominent writer for the paper, wrote a profile of David Bowie that almost singlehandedly ignited the singer&#x27;s dormant career. During the interview Bowie said, &quot;I&#x27;m gay, and always have been, even when I was David Jones.&quot; &quot;OH YOU PRETTY THING&quot; ran the headline, and swiftly became part of pop mythology. Bowie later attributed his success to this interview, stating that, &quot;Yeah, it was &quot;Melody Maker&quot; that made me. It was that piece by Mick Watts.&quot; During his tenure at the paper, Watts also toured with and interviewed artists including Syd Barrett, Waylon Jennings, Pink Floyd, Bob Dylan, and Bruce Springsteen.

Caroline Coon was headhunted by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; editor Ray Coleman in the mid-1970s and promptly made it her mission to get women musicians taken seriously. Between 1974 and 1976, she interviewed Maggie Bell, Joan Armatrading, Lynsey de Paul, and Twiggy. She then went on to make it her mission to promote punk rock.

In 1978, Richard Williams returned – after a stint working at Island Records – to the paper as the new editor and attempted to take &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in a new direction, influenced by what Paul Morley and Ian Penman were doing at &quot;NME&quot;. He recruited Jon Savage (formerly of &quot;Sounds&quot;), Chris Bohn and Mary Harron to provide intellectual coverage of post-punk bands like Gang of Four, Pere Ubu, and Joy Division and of new wave in general. Vivien Goldman, previously at &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot;, gave the paper improved coverage of reggae and soul music, restoring the superior coverage of those genres that the paper had in the early 1970s.

Internal tension developed, principally between Williams and Coleman, by this time editor-in-chief, who wanted the paper to stick to the more &quot;conservative rock&quot; music it had continued to support during the punk era. Coleman had been insistent that the paper should &quot;look like &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&quot; (renowned for its old-fashioned design), but Williams wanted the paper to look more contemporary. He commissioned an updated design, but this was rejected by Coleman.

==1980s==
In 1980, after a strike which had taken the paper (along with &quot;NME&quot;) out of publication for a period, Williams left &quot;MM&quot;. Coleman promoted Michael Oldfield from the design staff to day-to-day editor, and, for a while, took it back where it had been, with news of a line-up change in Jethro Tull replacing features about Andy Warhol, Gang of Four and Factory Records on the cover. Several journalists, such as Chris Bohn and Vivien Goldman, moved to &quot;NME&quot;, while Jon Savage joined the new magazine &quot;The Face&quot;. Coleman left in 1981, the paper&#x27;s design was updated, but sales and prestige were at a low ebb through the early 1980s, with &quot;NME&quot; dominant.

By 1983, the magazine had become more populist and pop-orientated, exemplified by its modish &quot;MM&quot; masthead, regular covers for the likes of Duran Duran and its choice of Eurythmics&#x27; &quot;Touch&quot; as the best album of the year. Things were to change, however. In February 1984, Allan Jones, a staff writer on the paper since 1974, was appointed editor: defying instructions to put Kajagoogoo on the cover, he led the magazine with an article on up-and-coming band The Smiths.

In 1986, &quot;MM&quot; was invigorated by the arrival of a group of journalists, including Simon Reynolds and David Stubbs, who had run a music fanzine called &quot;Monitor&quot; from the University of Oxford, and Chris Roberts, from &quot;Sounds&quot;, who established &quot;MM&quot; as more individualistic and intellectual. This was especially true after the hip-hop wars at &quot;NME&quot;, a schism between enthusiasts of progressive black music such as Public Enemy and Mantronix and fans of traditional white rock ended in a victory for the latter and the departure of writers such as Mark Sinker and Biba Kopf (as Chris Bohn was now calling himself), and the rise of Andrew Collins and Stuart Maconie, who pushed &quot;NME&quot; in a more populist direction.

==1990s==

While &quot;MM&quot; continued to devote most space to rock and indie music (notably Everett True&#x27;s coverage of the emerging grunge scene in Seattle), it covered house, hip hop, post-rock, rave and trip hop. Two of the paper&#x27;s writers, Push and Ben Turner, went on to launch IPC Media&#x27;s monthly dance music magazine &quot;Muzik&quot;. Even in the mid-1990s, when Britpop brought a new generation of readers to the music press, it remained less populist than its rivals, with younger writers such as Simon Price and Taylor Parkes continuing the 1980s tradition of iconoclasm and opinionated criticism. The paper printed harsh criticism of Ocean Colour Scene and Kula Shaker, and allowed dissenting views on Oasis and Blur at a time when they were praised by the rest of the press.

In 1993, they gave a French rock band called Darlin&#x27; a negative review calling their music &quot;a daft punky thrash&quot;. Darlin&#x27; eventually became the electronic music duo Daft Punk.

Australian journalist Andrew Mueller joined &quot;MM&quot; in 1990 and became Reviews Editor between 1991 and 1993, eventually declining to become Features Editor and leaving the magazine in 1993. He then went on to join &quot;NME&quot; under his former boss Steve Sutherland, who had left &quot;MM&quot; in 1992.

The magazine retained its large classified ads section, and remained the first call for musicians wanting to form a band. Suede formed through ads placed in the paper. &quot;MM&quot; also continued to publish reviews of musical equipment and readers&#x27; demo tapes, though these often had little in common stylistically with the rest of the paper, ensuring sales to jobbing musicians who would otherwise have little interest in the music press.

In early 1997, Allan Jones left to edit &quot;Uncut&quot;. He was replaced by Mark Sutherland, formerly of &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, who thus &quot;fulfilled [his] boyhood dream&quot; and stayed on to edit the magazine for three years. Many long-standing writers left, often moving to &quot;Uncut&quot;, with Simon Price departing allegedly because he objected to an edict that coverage of Oasis should be positive. Its sales, which had already been substantially lower than those of the NME, entered a serious decline.

In 1999, &quot;MM&quot; relaunched as a glossy magazine, but the magazine closed the following year, merging into IPC Media&#x27;s other music magazine, &quot;NME&quot;, which took on some of its journalists and music reviewers.

<doc id="462005" wikidata="Q2000912" url="?curid=462005" title="Standard basis">
<text>In mathematics, the standard basis (also called natural basis or [[canonical basis]]) of a coordinate vector space (such as formula_1 or formula_2) is the set of vectors, each of whose components are all zero, except one that equals 1. For example, in the case of the Euclidean plane formula_3 formed by the pairs of real numbers, the standard basis is formed by the vectors
formula_4
Similarly, the standard basis for the three-dimensional space formula_5 is formed by vectors
formula_6

Here the vector e&quot;x&quot; points in the &quot;x&quot; direction, the vector e&quot;y&quot; points in the &quot;y&quot; direction, and the vector e&quot;z&quot; points in the &quot;z&quot; direction. There are several common notations for standard-basis vectors, including {e&quot;x&quot;, e&quot;y&quot;, e&quot;z&quot;}, {e1, e2, e3}, {i, j, k}, and {x, y, z}. These vectors are sometimes written with a hat to emphasize their status as unit vectors (standard unit vectors).

These vectors are a basis in the sense that any other vector can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of these. For example, every vector v in three-dimensional space can be written uniquely as
formula_7
the scalars formula_8, formula_9, formula_10 being the scalar components of the vector v.

In the -dimensional Euclidean space formula_11, the standard basis consists of &quot;n&quot; distinct vectors
formula_12
where e&quot;i&quot; denotes the vector with a 1 in the th coordinate and 0&#x27;s elsewhere.

Standard bases can be defined for other vector spaces, whose definition involves coefficients, such as polynomials and matrices. In both cases, the standard basis consists of the elements of the space such that all coefficients but one are 0 and the non-zero one is 1. For polynomials, the standard basis thus consists of the monomials and is commonly called monomial basis. For matrices formula_13, the standard basis consists of the &quot;m&quot;×&quot;n&quot;-matrices with exactly one non-zero entry, which is 1. For example, the standard basis for 2×2 matrices is formed by the 4 matrices
formula_14

== Properties ==
By definition, the standard basis is a sequence of orthogonal unit vectors. In other words, it is an ordered and orthonormal basis. 

However, an ordered orthonormal basis is not necessarily a standard basis. For instance the two vectors representing a 30° rotation of the 2D standard basis described above, i.e. ,
formula_15
formula_16
are also orthogonal unit vectors, but they are not aligned with the axes of the Cartesian coordinate system, so the basis with these vectors does not meet the definition of standard basis.

==Generalizations==
There is a &quot;standard&quot; basis also for the ring of polynomials in &quot;n&quot; indeterminates over a field, namely the monomials.

All of the preceding are special cases of the indexed family
formula_17 
where formula_18 is any set and formula_19 is the Kronecker delta, equal to zero whenever and equal to 1 if .
This family is the &quot;canonical&quot; basis of the &quot;R&quot;-module (free module)
formula_20
of all families
formula_21 
from &quot;I&quot; into a ring &quot;R&quot;, which are zero except for a finite number of indices, if we interpret 1 as 1&quot;R&quot;, the unit in &quot;R&quot;.

==Other usages==
The existence of other &#x27;standard&#x27; bases has become a topic of interest in algebraic geometry, beginning with work of Hodge from 1943 on Grassmannians. It is now a part of representation theory called &quot;standard monomial theory&quot;. The idea of standard basis in the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra is established by the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem.

Gröbner bases are also sometimes called standard bases.

In physics, the standard basis vectors for a given Euclidean space are sometimes referred to as the versors of the axes of the corresponding Cartesian coordinate system.

<doc id="462006" wikidata="Q2978118" url="?curid=462006" title="Claude Ryan">
<text>Claude Ryan (January 26, 1925 – February 9, 2004) was a Canadian journalist and politician. He was the director of the newspaper &quot;Le Devoir&quot; from 1964 to 1978, leader of the Quebec Liberal Party from 1978 to 1982, National Assembly of Quebec member for Argenteuil from 1979 to 1994 and Minister of Education from 1985 to 1989.

==Early life==
Ryan was born in Montreal, Quebec, the son of Blandine Dorion and Henri-Albert Ryan. Ryan&#x27;s brother, Yves Ryan, was also politically active and served as mayor of Montreal North from 1963 to 2001.

==Journalism==
From 1962 to 1978, Ryan was editorialist at &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, a French-language daily newspaper in Montreal, and he was the director of the newspaper from 1964 to 1978. During his tenure at the head of the editorial staff he became known for his probity and his mastery of contemporary political issues. His advice was sought by the provincial governments of Quebec and by opposition parties.

During the 1970 October Crisis Ryan was accused of participating in a plot to overthrow Robert Bourassa&#x27;s recently elected government. Though the rumour was proven to be baseless, it served as a source of tension between Ryan and Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Elliott Trudeau, whom Ryan suspected of having spread the rumour in an attempt to damage him politically.

==Politics==
Bourassa lost the 1976 election and his own MNA seat to the Parti Québécois under René Lévesque, in part due to the editorial position of &quot;Le Devoir&quot; under Ryan&#x27;s stewardship. Subsequently, Ryan won the 1978 Quebec Liberal Party leadership election and served as party leader from 1978 to 1982, where he opposed Lévesque in two prominent campaigns (a referendum and an election).

Ryan led the victorious &quot;No&quot; side in the 1980 Quebec referendum on sovereignty which captured 60% of the vote. One particular turning point in the campaign was when Quebec PQ cabinet minister Lise Payette criticized Ryan&#x27;s wife, Madeleine, as an &quot;Yvette,&quot; a stay-at-home character in a popular Quebec storybook, then further suggesting that all females who were against sovereignty were acting as &quot;Yvettes&quot;. This attack outraged many women voters in Quebec, especially since Madeleine Ryan was very active in political and social circles. Madeleine herself responded by organizing a &quot;brunch des Yvettes&quot; at the Château Frontenac on March 30. A week later, 14,000 women gathered at the Montreal Forum to denounce Payette&#x27;s remarks. By nearly all accounts, many women voted &quot;No&quot; in the referendum out of anger at this insult.

Nonetheless, Pierre Trudeau was particularly critical of Ryan. Trudeau first criticized the performance of the Quebec Liberal Party, saying it was &quot;drowning in a swamp of its own verbiage&quot; during a televised National Assembly debate on sovereignty, in contrast to the Parti Québécois which had masterfully coordinated its speakers. Trudeau also said that Ryan&#x27;s initial campaign efforts of talking to small groups of people was insufficient, which resulted in the federal cabinet minister Jean Chrétien being sent in to help the federalist side. That helped to perpetuate the strained relationship between Ryan and Trudeau.

Ryan then led the party into the 1981 provincial election. His Liberals finished just 3% behind the PQ in the popular vote, but the latter won twice as many seats; Quebec elections have typically seen large discrepancies between raw votes and seat counts. The loss was widely blamed on Ryan&#x27;s campaign style, which was criticized for being old-fashioned and ill-suited for the television age. Notably, he refused to tailor sound bites for the evening news. Ryan was succeeded as MNA opposition leader and party chief by Bourassa, who was making a political comeback.

Ryan was the last non-interim Liberal leader who did not become premier until Dominique Anglade.

After the Liberals regained power under Bourassa in the 1985 election, Ryan became one of the most important members of the government and served as Minister of Education. He was also Minister of municipal affairs, public safety and minister responsible for the Charter of the French language. He also served in the cabinet led by Daniel Johnson.

Many in English Canada might remember Ryan for his work against the establishment of an independent Quebec. Those who followed his career, as a publisher and later as a politician, noted that he also opposed the existing federal status quo, which he considered as too centralized, despite statements to the contrary by Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau.

==Retirement==
Ryan retired from politics in September 1994. In 1995, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. In 2002, he was awarded the Canadian version of the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal.

Ryan died in Montreal, on February 9, 2004, at 4:20 a.m, of stomach cancer. In 2006, he was posthumously made a Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec.

==Works==
Besides his abundant editorial production in &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, Ryan also published:
*Les classes moyennes au Canada français, 1950
*L&#x27;éducation des adultes, réalité moderne, 1957
*Le contact dans l&#x27;apostolat, 1959
*Esprits durs, coeurs doux; la vie intellectuelle des militants chrétiens, 1959
*Les comités : esprit et méthodes, 1962
*Un type nouveau de laïc, 1966
*Le Devoir et la crise d&#x27;octobre 70, 1971
*Le Québec qui se fait, 1971
*Une société stable, 1978
*Regards sur le fédéralisme, 1995
*Mon testament spirituel, 2004

<text>Dorothy-Grace Elder is a Scottish journalist and former Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow region 1999–2003. She sat as an Independent MSP 2002–2003, having first sat as a Scottish National Party member from 1999 until she left the party in 2002. Among achievements for campaigning, she was awarded the 1996 Britain&#x27;s Reporter of the Year for investigative journalism at the British Press Awards. In 2019, she was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Scottish Press Awards.

==Journalism==
Elder was the first woman to run an investigative team, &quot;The Insiders&quot;, on the Glasgow Herald, where she worked on reporters, news features and leaders. She was later recruited by TV, beginning with BBC Scotland&#x27;s news programme &quot;Reporting Scotland&quot;. She wrote, filmed and produced numerous documentaries on social injustices for STV and the network. Other programmes for Scottish Television include &quot;Paramedics&quot;. and the first Scottish documentary on AIDS in 1988. For BBC Scotland and BBC Two, she filmed &quot;I Preferred Madness&quot;- the life story of Scots television pioneer John Logie Baird – filming between the UK, Canada and New York.

She worked as features editor and columnist on Scotland&#x27;s first cooperatively run newspaper, the ill-fated &quot;Scottish Daily News&quot;.

Elder has written columns and investigations for papers, including The Herald, Sunday Mail, Scotland on Sunday &quot;Rattling the Cages&quot; the Scottish Daily Express &quot;Off the Leash&quot;, The Daily Express (UK) &quot;Dear Dorothy&quot;.

She campaigned against conditions in Russian prisons for the destitute, including street children.

In 2007, she was appointed to an honorary professorship from Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen. She lectures in investigative journalism to honours year students of the university.

==Political career==
In June 1998, she was announced as an SNP candidate for the newly formed Scottish Parliament in the elections that would take place the following year.

In the 1999 election she stood in the Glasgow Baillieston constituency and gained a 17% swing to the SNP in a former Labour heartland. Although she did not win the seat outright, she was elected on the list to Parliament as a Scottish National Party (SNP) representative for Glasgow region. She was a member of the Health and Community Care Committee and a member of the Public Petitions Committee. A left-winger, she supported Alex Neil in the SNP leadership election of 2000.

As an MSP, Elder continued campaigning. She researched pollution and ill health in the East End of Glasgow, becoming the first MSP to take a pollution case to Brussels against dumping in the East End and an incinerator for dead cattle being allowed near housing and a hospital. She won the case in Europe. While in the Scottish Parliament, Elder launched a cross party group to look at shortage of help for chronic pain patients. In February 2002, she led a member&#x27;s debate on the issue. Scotland had no residential service for severe chronic pain cases, with some sent hundreds of miles to Bath. Elder fought for 12 years for a residential service in Scotland, which was achieved in 2015. She continues to be strongly involved with the cross-party group, long after her term as MSP finished.

She became dissatisfied with the way in which the SNP was being run and in May 2002 she resigned from the SNP. From that point, she sat in the Parliament as an independent MSP. She did not stand for re-election at the 2003 election, returning to journalism instead.

She is also a former Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association candidate for the post of rector of the University of Glasgow, losing to the actor Richard Wilson in 1996. She was known for her campaigning abilities.

Reflecting on her political career in 2021, Elder wrote that despite sharing an office for three years with future First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Sturgeon had refused to speak to her. She also claimed that: &quot;I was reported to the chief whip after a woman MSP and one of Nicola [Sturgeon]’s chums discovered I had privately asked a women’s group for advice on male bullying in politics... I was set to be disciplined. It made me sick and I walked out.&quot; The SNP responded: &quot;Ms Elder has not been a member for almost two decades.&quot;

==Awards and honours==
1994 Oliver Brown Award for services to Scotland

1996 Britain&#x27;s Reporter of the Year at the British Press Awards for investigative journalism

1998 Citation from the City of Pushkin for Humanitarian Aid to hospitals and prisons

2014 Medical Journalists&#x27; Assoc UK Health Campaign Award

In 2019, she was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Scottish Press Awards.

<text>The yellow rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis) is a small secretive marsh bird of the family Rallidae that is found in North America.

==Taxonomy==
The yellow rail was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the coots in the genus &quot;Fulica&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Fulica noveboracensis&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;yellow breasted gallinule&quot; that had been briefly described in 1785 by the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant in his book &quot;Arctic Zoology&quot;. The yellow rail is now placed in the genus &quot;Coturnicops&quot; that was erected in 1855 by the English zoologist George Robert Gray. The genus name combines &quot;coturnix&quot;, the Latin word for a &quot;quail&quot;, with &quot;ōps&quot;, an Ancient Greek word meaning &quot;appearance&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;noveboracensis&quot; is Latin for New York (&quot;novus&quot; means &quot;new&quot; and &quot;Eboracum&quot; is York, England).

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. n. noveboracensis&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – Canada and north USA
* † &quot;C. n. goldmani&quot; (Nelson, 1904) – central Mexico (extinct)

==Description==
Adults have brown upperparts streaked with black, a yellowish-brown breast, a light belly and barred flanks. The short thick dark bill turns yellow in males during the breeding season. The feathers on the back are edged with white. There is a yellow-brown band over the eye and the legs are greenish-yellow. The birds measure in overall length; males have an average weight of , females an average weight of .

==Distribution and habitat==
The nominate subspecies&#x27; breeding habitat is wet meadows, fens and shallow marshes across Canada east of the Rockies; also the northeastern United States and the entire northern Canada–US border Great Plains to the Great Lakes. These northern populations of yellow rail migrate to the southeastern coastal United States. Little is known about the yellow rail&#x27;s winter habits beyond sites along coastal Texas, southeast Oklahoma, and coastal South Carolina. However, researchers have concluded through observational studies that the relative abundance of yellow rails increased in relation to the size of the area surveyed and was higher at sites burned within 3 years. Across sites, each additional hour of survey effort increased the number of birds detected by 0.66 rails/h. Findings indicate yellow rails overwinter in wet pine savanna habitats along the northern Gulf Coast region.

The subspecies &quot;Coturnicops noveboracensis goldmani&quot; is known only from marshes on the upper Río Lerma (Lerma River) around 2,500 m in elevation in State of Mexico, Mexico, where it was last recorded in 1964.

==Behaviour==
The yellow rail are very elusive and seldom seen. They generally call at night resembling the sound of two stones being clicked together &quot;tik-tik tik-tik-tik&quot; in repetition. When approached, they are more likely to rely on camouflage and escaping on foot through dense vegetation, rather than flushing.

===Breeding===
The nest is a shallow cup built with marsh vegetation on damp ground under a canopy of dead plants. It is made out of woven grasses and leaves.

This rail lays a clutch of five to 10 oval or elongate eggs that usually measure around . These eggs are creamy, and spotted with both reddish spots that form a ring at one end, and small black spots that are scattered over the egg. They are incubated by the female for a period of 16 to 18 days. If the first set of eggs are destroyed, the female will generally lay another clutch. After the chicks hatch, the female will either crush the eggshells and hide them from view at the bottom of the nest, or remove the eggshells from the nest, dropping them along the paths leading away from the nest.

===Food and feeding===
The yellow rail feeds primarily on small invertebrates and complements its diet with plant seeds. Beetles (Coleoptera) account for the highest proportion of the birds&#x27; diet, followed by spiders (Araneae) and snails (Gastropods), whereas plant matter is dominated by sedges (Cyperaceae) and rushes (Juncaceae).

==Status==
Their numbers have declined in recent years due to loss of habitat. However, in 2021 a survey using autonomous sound recorders in the Edéhzhíe Protected Area in Canada&#x27;s Northwest Territories, outside the species&#x27; known range, reported an estimated population of 906 breeding pairs, which may suggest that the species is more widespread than previously thought.

<text>Socialist Action is a Trotskyist political party in the United States. SAct formed in 1983, when its members were expelled from the Socialist Workers Party.

SAct describes itself as a revolutionary socialist party fighting for true democracy, because capitalist states &quot;cannot be used as tools of the working class, but have to be smashed&quot;.

Notable members include Jeff Mackler.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In 1983, the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) expelled two groups: First, the Fourth Internationalist Tendency (FIT). Second, the group that would coalesce around the &quot;Socialist Action&quot; (SAct) newspaper. SAct argued that they were expelled for defending Trotskyist ideas of Permanent Revolution, class independence, and continued support for the Fourth International. The first issue of its newspaper contained no listing of an editorial board.

=== Subsequent history ===
In 1985, SAct split in two. Those who split created Socialist Unity (SU). In 1986, SU merged with Workers Power and the International Socialists to form Solidarity.

After the split, SAct reorganized as a Trotskyist party. SAct planned a Central America solidarity conference.

In 2004, SAct won the right to refuse to disclose its campaign donors, because of demonstrable government harassment of socialist candidates, as did Communist Party USA, Freedom Socialist Party, and Socialist Workers Party.

In 1992, during the Gulf War, SAct was active in the San Francisco Bay Area antiwar movement through the National Campaign Against the War in the Middle East, which competed with the Workers World Party-led Coalition Against a Vietnam War in the Middle East.

In 2019, a minority faction was expelled or resigned membership from Socialist Action and re-established as Socialist Resurgence.

== Ideology ==

Socialist Action is a Trotskyist and Revolutionary socialist party. 

The party has claimed that the Euromaidan revolution in Ukraine was a &quot;US-backed fascist coup&quot;, alongside claiming that Ukraine banned the Russian language.

== Election results ==
Socialist Action (SA) has fielded electoral candidates in the United States for local, state, and federal offices.

One SA member, Adam Ritscher, won an uncontested election. No SA member has won a contested election.

=== Presidential elections ===
In 2020, SAct again nominated Mackler. SAct again gained no ballot access or write-in status in any state, and thus received zero votes.

In 2016, SAct nominated their first presidential ticket, selecting national secretary Jeff Mackler for president and Karen Schraufnagel for vice-president.

=== Congressional elections ===
In 2018, SA member and Iraq War veteran Fred Linck hoped to run as Socialist Action candidate for United States Senate in Connecticut. The party submitted over 11,000 signatures to the Connecticut Secretary of State, but too many were disqualified for Linck to be placed on the November ballot. Linck asserted that local officials incorrectly invalidated signatures. Despite being left off the ballot, Linck continued to run for office as an official write-in candidate, and ultimately received 70 votes, or 0.01%.

=== Local elections ===
In 1988, SA member Sylvia Weinstein ran for San Francisco Board of Education, in which she won 21,000 votes. Weinstein also ran in 1985 and 1986.

<text>An alidade () (archaic forms include alhidade, alhidad, alidad) or a turning board is a device that allows one to sight a distant object and use the line of sight to perform a task. This task can be, for example, to triangulate a scale map on site using a plane table drawing of intersecting lines in the direction of the object from two or more points or to measure the angle and horizontal distance to the object from some reference point&#x27;s polar measurement. Angles measured can be horizontal, vertical or in any chosen plane.

The alidade sighting ruler was originally a part of many types of scientific and astronomical instrument. At one time, some alidades, particularly using circular graduations as on astrolabes, were also called &quot;diopters&quot;. With modern technology, the name is applied to complete instruments such as the &#x27;plane table alidade&#x27;.

== Origins ==
The word in Arabic (, , ), signifies the same device. In Greek and Latin, it is respectively called , &quot;dioptra&quot;, and , &quot;fiducial line&quot;.

The earliest alidades consisted of a bar, rod or similar component with a vane on each end. Each vane (also called a pinnule or pinule) has a hole, slot or other indicator through which one can view a distant object. There may also be a pointer or pointers on the alidade to indicate a position on a scale. Alidades have been made of wood, ivory, brass and other materials.

== Examples of old alidade types ==
The figure on the left displays drawings that attempt to show the general forms of various alidades that can be found on many antique instruments. Real alidades of these types could be much more decorative, revealing the maker&#x27;s artistic talents as well as his technical skills. In the terminology of the time, the edge of an alidade at which one reads a scale or draws a line is called a &quot;fiducial edge&quot;.

Alidade B in the diagram shows a straight, flat bar with a vane at either end. No pointers are used. The vanes are not centred on the bar but offset so that the sight line coincides with the edge of the bar.

The vanes have a rectangular hole in each with a fine wire held vertically in the opening. To use the alidade, the user sights an object and lines it up with the wires in each vane. This type of alidade could be found on a plane table, graphometer or similar instrument.

Alidades A and C are similar to B but have a slit or circular hole without a wire. In the diagram, the openings are exaggerated in size to show the shape; they would be smaller in a real alidade, perhaps 2 mm or so in width. One can look through the openings and line the openings up with the object of interest in the distance. With a small opening, the error in sighting the object is small. However, if a dim object such as a star is observed through a small hole, the image is difficult to see.

This form is shown in the diagram as having pointers. These can be used to read off an angle on a scale that is engraved around the outer edge (or ) of the instrument. Alidades of this form are found on astrolabes, mariner&#x27;s astrolabes and similar instruments.

Alidade D has vanes without any openings. In this case, the object is viewed and the alidade is rotated until the two opposite vanes simultaneously eclipse the object. With skill, this sort of alidade can yield very precise measures. In this example, pointers are shown.

Alidade E is a representation of a very interesting design by Johannes Hevelius. Hevelius was following in Tycho Brahe&#x27;s footsteps and cataloging star positions with high accuracy. He did have access to the telescopic sights that were being used by astronomers in other countries, however, he chose to use naked-eye observations for his positional instruments. Due to the design of his instruments and the alidades, as well as his diligent practices, he was able to yield very precise measures.

Hevelius&#x27; design featured a pivot point with a vertical cylinder and a vane at the observer&#x27;s end. The vane had two narrow slits that were spaced precisely the same distance apart as the diameter of the cylinder (in the diagram, the portion of the vane between the slits is removed for clarity; the left and right edges of the opening represent the slits). If the observer could sight a star on only one side of the cylinder, as seen in F, the alignment was off. By carefully moving the vane so that the star could just barely be seen on either side of the cylinder (G), the alidade was aligned with the position of the star. This could not be used with a closely located object. A star, being so far away as to exhibit no parallax to the naked-eye, would be observable as a point source simultaneously on both sides.

== Modern alidade types ==

The alidade is the part of a theodolite that rotates around the vertical axis, and that bears the horizontal axis around which the telescope (or visor, in early telescope-less instruments) turns up or down.

In a sextant or octant the alidade is the turnable arm carrying a mirror and an index to a graduated circle in a vertical plane. Today it is more commonly called an &#x27;index arm&#x27;.

Alidade tables have also long been used in fire towers for sighting the bearing to a forest fire. A topographic map of the local area, with a suitable scale, is oriented, centered and permanently mounted on a leveled circular table surrounded by an arc calibrated to true north of the map and graduated in degrees (and fractions) of arc. Two vertical sight apertures are arranged opposite each other and can be rotated along the graduated arc of the horizontal table. To determine a bearing to a suspected fire, the user looks through the two sights and adjusts them until they are aligned with the source of the smoke (or an observed lightning strike to be monitored for smoke). &quot;See&quot; Osborne Fire Finder.

<text>John Edward Michael Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh, (26 November 1937 – 20 May 2019) was a British Conservative Party politician who was Member of Parliament for Croydon Central from February 1974 until 1992. During the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher he enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of government, which culminated in his serving as a Secretary of State in the Cabinet from 1987 to 1989. For a time, he was considered a rising star of his party and a potential leadership contender.

Moore was particularly noted for his &quot;filmstar good looks&quot; and an American background: Moore&#x27;s wife was American and he had lived for several years in the US. He brought aspects of American corporate culture to government and was reported to speak with a slight American accent. His first political experience was as a Democratic Party organiser in Illinois during the early 1960s.

Moore&#x27;s fortunes in government waned after 1987 when he was made responsible for the highly sensitive portfolios of health and social security. His earlier success had been as a facilitator of the Thatcher government&#x27;s privatisation programme. In this capacity he became known as &quot;Mr Privatisation&quot;. When Moore attempted to extend this concept into the management of the National Health Service and the wider provision of social services, he encountered opposition from all sides. After losing credibility he was effectively demoted in 1988 (through loss of the health portfolio) and then sacked from his cabinet post in 1989.

Moore left the House of Commons in 1992, subsequently holding a number of corporate directorships and chairmanships.

==Early life==
Moore was born in Kentish Town, London, in 1937. His father was a factory worker who later became a publican. He attended the Licensed Victuallers&#x27; School in Slough, an independent school supported by his father&#x27;s trade body. After leaving school, Moore undertook two years of National Service from 1955 to 1957. He served with the Royal Sussex Regiment in Korea and won a temporary commission.

He enrolled at the London School of Economics in 1958, and followed a three-year degree course. He was active in student politics, and held the position of President of the LSE Students&#x27; Union. During this time he met fellow student Sheila Tillotson. Moore accompanied Tillotson back to her native Chicago after the two had both completed their studies. Here the couple married in 1962 and Moore found work initially as a financial analyst with a Chicago investment bank. He became a stockbroker, and achieved a senior position at the Chicago office of the Dean Witter brokerage. Dean Witter catered to a mainly middle-class clientele, with the typical client holding only a modest portfolio of stock.

While in Chicago, Moore became a Democratic Party activist, motivated by his opposition to segregation, and served as a &quot;precinct captain&quot;. In this capacity he gained experience of American political campaigning which he later applied in the UK. He was reportedly much impressed by President John F. Kennedy, and adopted him as a role model.

Moore returned to the UK in 1968, and took up an appointment in London as Chairman of Dean Witter (International). The Moores set up residence in the suburb of Wimbledon where their three children (one daughter and two sons) were born. Moore became active in local Conservative politics and was elected to serve as a Councillor in the London Borough of Merton in 1971. He initially gave the impression of being a liberal conservative. For example, he opposed the withdrawal of free school milk from the Borough&#x27;s children which was happening as the result of the government budget cuts policy.

In October 1973, he was adopted as the prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Croydon Central constituency. At this time he was described as being &quot;an investment banker and stockbroker&quot;.

==Early political career==
Croydon Central was a new constituency, and was initially very marginally Conservative. Moore won the seat in the February 1974 general election by a majority of 1,300 votes over Labour. His majority was reduced to 164 in the October 1974 election. However, he was able to strengthen his position in the constituency; the last time he contested the seat (in the 1987 election) he achieved a majority of over 10,000. His wife, Sheila, acted as his constituency secretary, speech writer and political adviser. She combined her duties in this regard with studying for a law degree and acting as a local magistrate. Observers commented that Sheila was very much the driving force behind his rise in politics.

Moore projected the image of a young, vigorous politician. He would usually rise at 05:30 and be at his desk by 07:00. He was a member of the House of Commons football team and the House skiing team. It is reported that his wife &quot;... kept him on a strict regime of camomile tea, decaffeinated coffee and health food...&quot; He was frequently seen jogging in the early morning in the Westminster area, and was reported to spend 30 minutes each day on an exercise bicycle. In 1987, Conservative MP Julian Critchley described him as &quot;Handsome, with the sort of looks that would have appealed to J. Arthur Rank, personable and polite&quot; and looking &quot;ten years younger than his 49 years&quot;.

Margaret Thatcher appointed Moore as one of five Conservative Party vice-chairmen in March 1975, shortly after she became Conservative leader. Moore&#x27;s remit was &quot;youth&quot;. He held this position until the Conservatives were returned to office in 1979, at which time he was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy. In this capacity, one of his main duties was responsibility for the nationalised British coal industry.

After the 1983 general election, Moore was appointed Economic Secretary to the Treasury under Chancellor Nigel Lawson. At the Treasury, Moore was charged with fronting government policy on privatisation. Most notably, he oversaw the privatisation of British Telecom in 1984 and that of several other major utilities supplying gas, electricity and water. The privatisation of state-owned industries was a major feature of the Thatcher governments. These privatisations were popularised by small parcels of shares in the privatised entities being made available to members of the public at deeply discounted prices. This promoted a form of popular capitalism along the lines of the Dean Witter business model. Moore gained an extremely high profile and became known as &quot;Mr Privatisation&quot;.

==Cabinet career==
Moore joined Thatcher&#x27;s Cabinet in 1986 as Secretary of State for Transport. His tenure of office at Transport was brief but coincided with the completion of major developments such as the M25 London orbital motorway and the privatisation of British Airways. The capsizing of the Herald of Free Enterprise car ferry outside Zeebrugge harbour on 6 March 1987 gave Moore considerable media exposure. These events served to raise Moore&#x27;s profile even further and he played a prominent campaign role in the 1987 general election.

... what probably clinched his promotion to the DHSS yesterday was his TV performance in the party political broadcast that attacked the loony left. It was Thatcher herself who suggested that Moore be used on it. The broadcast was, according to one observer, considered &quot;sharp, nasty – and effective&quot;.

By now, Moore was being widely spoken of as a future Prime Minister, with journalist Brian Walden saying in 1987 that &quot;he has future Tory leader written all over him&quot;. After the 1987 election he was appointed as Secretary of State for Social Services. In this capacity he was responsible for the National Health Service&#x27;s £66 billion annual spend, and the payment of over £50 billion annually in the form of social security benefits. These were highly sensitive portfolios that were intended to be very much at the centre of policy initiatives in the 1987 government.

However, there were some early misgivings about the appointment. Describing Moore&#x27;s earlier career in government, Julian Critchley said, &quot;The script had been written for him, and he had only to learn his lines&quot;. Other commentators noted that his previous experience had been in implementing policy rather than in creating policy. In 2012 David Waddington, Mrs Thatcher&#x27;s former Chief Whip and Home Secretary published a memoir of his time in government (&#x27;Dispatches&#x27;) in which he reported that Thatcher had a weakness for &quot;a good-looking fellow&quot; when it came to making government appointments. &quot;Once or twice she ... wished to have some good-looking fellow promoted who was known to be useless. ... He was a fine-looking chap but nobody else thought he was anything like up to the job.&quot; Waddington declined to name the people he referred to but many commentators stated that Moore was one clear beneficiary of this personal foible.

Once established in his new job, Moore delivered a series of speeches on policy in the social services. These speeches appeared to indicate a move to a healthcare system based on private insurance, similar to the American model. Specific proposals included making private healthcare insurance contributions tax-deductible, and allowing nurses&#x27; wage rates to be established by local bargaining rather than by central negotiation. Moore quickly encountered opposition from various interest groups, including the Royal College of Physicians. Many Conservative backbench MPs had misgivings about what was being proposed. Furthermore, some of the speeches suggested that Moore was positioning himself to be leader of the Conservative Party. During a visit to the US in October 1987, he delivered a speech to the Mont Pelerin Society in which he appeared to suggest that he had been the prime mover behind privatisation in the UK. This displeased his fellow Ministers and other senior Party figures.

Moore did not seem to engage comfortably in the public estimate procedures by which departmental spending budgets were set. The then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, John Major, was reported to have found Moore to be &quot;a soft touch&quot;. The then Health Minister, Edwina Currie, is reported to have described Moore as being &quot;useless&quot;. An entry in her diary dated January 1988 reads: &quot;It became apparent during the first ten days ... that Moore just didn&#x27;t know what to do&quot;. Moore found difficulties in his relationships with senior civil servants. Not all the latter were comfortable with a working day that started at 07:00. Moore&#x27;s wife (and political adviser), Sheila, had clashes with civil servants, and Moore was privately warned that she did not understand the British way of doing things. It is believed that Sheila may have drafted some of Moore&#x27;s more controversial speeches.

A 1987 Cabinet Office memo written by Moore stated that the Government had adopted a Policy of not accepting any direct responsibility for the Contaminated Blood Scandal. It was unearthed and made public in 2017 with many of those affected by the scandal alleging a cover-up.

In November 1987, Moore was struck down with bacterial pneumonia. He initially ignored the illness and tried to attend a cabinet meeting, during which he lost consciousness, and was subsequently admitted to Parkside Hospital in Wimbledon. The fact that this was a private clinic owned by a German healthcare company (reportedly charging patients up to £2,000 per day) attracted bad publicity. Union leader Rodney Bickerstaffe stated &quot;How can a social services secretary claim to care about the National Health Service when he does not even trust his own health care to an NHS hospital?&quot;.

==End of political career==
After two months&#x27; absence due to illness, Moore returned to work but by now his political prospects were much diminished. The Department of Health and Social Security was split into two separate ministries, with Kenneth Clarke becoming Secretary of State for Health on 25 July 1988. Moore remained in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Social Security for a further year. However, his credibility was further damaged by speeches in which he appeared to suggest that poverty had been abolished in modern Britain. His attempt to target state assistance towards poorer families while freezing child benefits provoked a major rebellion by Conservative backbench MPs.

Moore was sacked from the cabinet in July 1989. Most commentators at the time considered him to have been a weak politician who had been promoted beyond his ability. One colleague compared him to &#x27;a frightened rabbit mesmerised by oncoming headlights&#x27;.

Between his sacking from the Cabinet in 1989 and stepping down from the House of Commons in 1992 his only contributions were in two transport debates. He gave up his parliamentary seat at the time of the 1992 general election. After leaving government Moore held a number of directorships with large concerns, including Credit Suisse Asset Management and Rolls-Royce. In 2010 he retired as Chairman of the Monitor Group.

After leaving the Commons, Moore became a life peer as Baron Moore of Lower Marsh, of Lower Marsh in the London Borough of Lambeth. His attendance was very sparse; a BBC feature in August 2011 reported that after 20 years in the House of Lords, Moore had still to make his maiden speech.

==Personal life==
Moore and his wife, the former Sheila Tillotson, had three children and were married until her death in 2008. Moore had a longstanding interest in exercise and fitness. During his time as an MP, he played football and took up skiing; later in life, he competed in a triathlon when he was 64, which he completed despite a fall off his bike at one point, and also became an avid practitioner of tai chi. He died from complications of pneumonia and a stroke at St George&#x27;s Hospital in London on 20 May 2019, aged 81.

<text>The Nova Scotia New Democratic Party (Nova Scotia NDP) is a social democratic political party in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is the provincial section for the province of the federal New Democratic Party. 

It was founded as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1932, and became the New Democratic Party in 1961. It became the governing party of Nova Scotia following the 2009 Nova Scotia election, winning 31 seats in the Legislature, under the leadership of Premier Darrell Dexter. It is the only New Democratic Party in Atlantic Canada to form a government, and the second to form a government in a province east of Manitoba. The party lost government at the 2013 election, losing 24 seats, including Dexter&#x27;s seat. Gary Burrill, the party’s leader from 2016 to 2022, is credited with bringing the party back to its left-wing roots. The party currently holds six seats in the Legislature and has been led by Claudia Chender since June 2022.

==Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (1933–1961)==
Since shortly after confederation, Nova Scotia has had a two-party system in which power alternated between the Nova Scotia Liberal Party and Progressive Conservatives. In the 1920 provincial election the left had a breakthrough when the United Farmers won six seats and the Independent Labour Party won five. The two forces joined to form an 11-member official opposition under Daniel G. Mackenzie, but the group was undermined by the Liberals (who tarnished the image of the opposition MLAs by offering them payments) and the United Farmers/Labour grouping was wiped out in 1925.

Though the CCF/NDP has a long history in Nova Scotia, it was unable to break the two-party system and win more than a handful of seats (if any) in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly until the 1990s.

The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation was formed in 1932 and ran its first candidates in the 1933 general election but failed to win any electoral representation. The party did not contest the 1937 general election.

In the 1939 Cape Breton Centre, by-election Douglas MacDonald won the CCF&#x27;s first seat in the legislature.

In 1941, the future Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) president Donald MacDonald was elected from the Cape Breton South constituency. He was joined by Douglas Neil Brodie, who was elected in Cape Breton East constituency, bringing the CCF up to a total of three MLAs. Donald MacDonald was the party&#x27;s leader in the Assembly until 1945. He lost a close campaign in the 1945 election, but the party still retained two seats on Cape Breton Island. MacDonald then transitioned into working full-time with the Canadian Congress of Labour, a predecessor of the CLC. 
A lot of the early organization of the CCF in Nova Scotia was done by Maritime Organizer Fred Young. Young would go on to continue his work in Ontario and eventually sit as a member of the Ontario Legislature, however, his early work laid the groundwork for any future advancements the party would make during this period. This was evident in 1945 when two CCF members elected from Cape Breton.

Russell Cunningham was the only CCF leader to serve as Leader of the Opposition after the 1945 provincial election in which Premier Angus L. Macdonald&#x27;s Liberal Party swept 28 of the 30 seats and the Tories were wiped out. CCFers Cunningham and fellow Cape Bretoner Michael James MacDonald were the only opposition MLAs elected. Cunningham and MacDonald were re-elected in 1949 but were reduced to third party status behind Robert Stanfield&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives.

MacDonald led the CCF from 1953 to 1963 and was the party&#x27;s sole MLA in that period, even though he won 8.9% of the popular vote for the CCF in the 1960 election.

==Nova Scotia NDP (1961–present)==

Following the creation of the federal and provincial New Democratic Party (NDP), MacDonald stepped down as leader and the locus of authority in the party moved to Halifax under the leadership of Professor James H. Aitchison. MacDonald lost his seat in the 1963 provincial election. The NDP would not win another until Jeremy Akerman became party leader and won the riding of Cape Breton East in the 1970 election. NDP representation in the House of Assembly grew slowly in throughout the 1970s, but never rose above four seats. The CCF had only been able to win seats on Cape Breton Island and the NDP did not win seats outside of Cape Breton until 1981. With the election of the 26-year-old Akerman as party leader in 1968, and his subsequent election to the legislature two years later, the party regained and developed its strong base in industrial Cape Breton, and won four seats in the election of 1978. However, the party failed to win any seats on the mainland, and this exacerbated tensions between the Akerman-dominated Cape Breton wing of the party and the university-based party establishment in Halifax. Following increasingly bloody internal battles Akerman resigned and the NDP lost all four Cape Breton seats in the following election.

===Alexa McDonough===

In 1980, Haligonian Alexa McDonough became leader of the Nova Scotia NDP, the first female leader of a major recognized party in Canada. She was the only NDP candidate elected in 1981. During her 14-year leadership, the NDP never had more than three Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). Nonetheless, she raised the party&#x27;s profile and become a well known advocate for the poor and disadvantaged. In a reversal of earlier times, while the NDP under McDonough won seats on the mainland for the first time, it lost all of its Cape Breton seats in the 1981 election and never regained them during McDonough&#x27;s leadership. She resigned as Nova Scotia NDP leader in 1994 and went on to be elected leader of the federal NDP in 1995.

===Chisholm years: Breakthrough===

Under Robert Chisholm&#x27;s leadership, in 1998 the party vaulted from third place to ahead of the Progressive Conservatives (PCs), and won 19 seats in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, the same number of seats as won by the Liberals. The Liberals formed a minority government with the support of 14 Progressive Conservatives (Tories), the latter who had also improved their standings. An NDP government seemed imminent.

However, the party was unable to improve on its standings in the 1999 election. But with 11 seats in the legislature with 29.9% of the vote, it edged out the Liberals and were able to retain &quot;Official Opposition&quot; status when the PCs formed a majority government under John Hamm. Chisholm&#x27;s unexpected resignation immediately following the election led to a period of internal party strife, with new leader Helen MacDonald, a former Cape Breton MLA, resigning after barely a year.

===First government under Darrell Dexter===

The 2003 election resulted in a PC minority government while the NDP maintained Official Opposition status under new leader Darrell Dexter. In the election, the NDP won 15 seats and 31% of the vote, coming slightly behind the Liberals in the popular vote but winning three more seats than the Liberals&#x27; 12. In the 2006 election, the NDP managed to capitalize on its position as the Official Opposition to squeeze the Liberal vote, and the party increased its number of seats from 15 to 20, an all-time high, and won 34.63% of the vote. Unlike in 2003, in 2006 the NDP came in a clear second in the popular vote, far ahead of the Liberals.

On June 9, 2009, Dexter led the NDP to victory, winning a majority government, and was sworn in as Premier of Nova Scotia on June 19, 2009. His party&#x27;s victory marked the first time that the NDP had won government in a province east of Ontario, and only the second time the party had won government east of Manitoba. When the party won in 2009, a major reason for their winning is the way the party used political marketing. The political marketing strategy was used in Manitoba years before the Nova Scotia NDP used the strategy. The Dexter government lasted a single term and was defeated in the October 8, 2013 provincial election. Although it finished second in terms of popular vote with 26.84%, the party collapsed to only seven seats, making it the third party in the legislature. This was mainly because the NDP&#x27;s support in Halifax, its power base for two decades, practically melted. The NDP had gone into the election holding 14 of the capital&#x27;s 20 seats, but lost all but two. Among them was Dexter, who narrowly lost his own seat. On November 16, 2013, Dexter announced his resignation as NDP leader, effective November 23, 2013.

Maureen MacDonald served as interim leader from Dexter&#x27;s resignation in 2013, until Gary Burrill&#x27;s election as leader, in 2016.

Two members of the party&#x27;s caucus, Gordie Gosse and Frank Corbett resigned for personal reasons in April 2015, triggering two of three provincial by-elections which were held on July 14. The party lost both of those seats, but Marian Mancini won the third by-election in a seat that had been held by the Liberals.

===Gary Burrill===

Under Gary Burrill&#x27;s leadership in the 2017 election, the NDP took seven seats, the same number the party received on election night in 2013 but two more than it held going into the election. Since that election, three NDP MLAs resigned: Dave Wilson, Lenore Zann, and Tammy Martin.

In the 2021 provincial election, the NDP won six seats and Burrill was personally re-elected. On November 9, 2021, Burrill announced that he will resign as leader once a new leader is chosen. He was succeeded by Claudia Chender on June 25, 2022 at a leadership convention held in Dartmouth to confirm her as leader. Chender was the sole candidate to register to replace Burrill.

===Claudia Chender===
On February 14, 2022, Claudia Chender declared her candidacy to replace Gary Burrill as leader. On May 21, 2022, registration closed for the leadership race, with Chender being the sole candidate. She was confirmed as leader after a general membership vote on June 25, 2022. She is the third female leader of the NSNDP, with the previous female leaders being Alexa McDonough and Helen MacDonald; fourth leader, if interim leader Maureen MacDonald is included.

==Current Nova Scotia New Democrat MLAs==
==Youth wing==

The youth wing of the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party is the Nova Scotia Young New Democrats (NSYND). Founded in the early 1960s, it was not incorporated with a full constitution - aligned with that of the party proper - until 1969.

The youth wing was partially responsible for the election of Jeremy Akerman, as leader, at the 1968 Leadership Convention.

In 1994, the NSYND was renamed &quot;The Nova Scotia NDP Youth Wing&quot;. At this time the youth wing was quite moderate, encouraging the main party to focus on government and embrace mainstream values such as fiscal responsibility, &quot;one member one vote&quot; and banning corporate and union donations. They also successfully lobbied the party to include more youth members in the party structure. Members and alumni of the youth wing were instrumental in forming NDProgress in 2000.

In a controversial move, the youth wing was renamed the “New Party Youth Movement” (NPYM) in 2001. The name change was made to advocate a renewal of the NDP similar the one in 1961 when the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) became the NDP. The “New Party” name was taken from the “New Party” groups formed before the creation of the NDP. The NPYM made a positive impact at the 2001 NSNDP convention pushing the party to adopt a “one member one vote” style of electing its leader, successfully distributed home-made buttons to satire an organized attempt to shame members of the NDP caucus who did not support former leader Helen MacDonald and gaining over 2/3 support from convention delegates for their name change.

The youth wing was reconstituted in 2004 under its current name, the Nova Scotia Young New Democrats (NSYND); the wing has remained ideologically in step with that of the party proper.

<text>The year 1713 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events.

==Astronomy==
* John Rowley of London produces an orrery to a commission by Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery.

==Mathematics==
* September 9 – Nicolas Bernoulli first describes the St. Petersburg paradox in a letter to Pierre Raymond de Montmort.
* November 13 – James Waldegrave provides the first known minimax mixed strategy solution to a two-person game, in a letter to de Montmort.
* Jacob Bernoulli&#x27;s best known work, &quot;Ars Conjectandi&quot; (&quot;The Art of Conjecture&quot;), is published posthumously by his nephew. It contains a mathematical proof of the law of large numbers, the Bernoulli numbers, and other important research in probability theory and enumeration.

==Medicine==
* William Cheselden publishes &quot;Anatomy of the Human Body&quot; and it becomes a popular work on anatomy, at least in part due to it being written in English rather than Latin.
* Italian Bernardino Ramazzini provides one of the first descriptions of task-specific dystonia in his book of occupational diseases, &quot;Morbis Artificum&quot;, noting in chapter II of its Supplementum that &quot;Scribes and Notaries&quot; may develop &quot;incessant movement of the hand, always in the same direction … the continuous and almost tonic strain on the muscles... that results in failure of power in the right hand&quot;.

==Physics==
* The second edition of Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; is published with an introduction by Roger Cotes and an essay by Newton titled &quot;General Scholium&quot; where he famously states &quot;Hypotheses non fingo&quot; (&quot;I feign no hypotheses&quot;).

==Technology==
* (c. 1713) Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit switches from using alcohol to mercury as the thermometric fluid in his thermometers, creating the first mercury-in-glass thermometer.
* Andrew Robinson builds the first ship called a schooner in Gloucester, Massachusetts.

==Births==
* March 15 – Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, French astronomer (baptized December 28; died 1762)
* May 3 – Alexis Claude Clairaut, French mathematician (died 1765)
* May 25 – John Stuart, Lord Mount Stuart, Scottish politician and botanist (died 1792)
* September 10 – John Needham, English biologist (died 1781)
* Anthony Addington, English physician (died 1790)
* Jean Paul de Gua de Malves, French mathematician (died 1785)

==Deaths==
* April 29 (&quot;bur.&quot;) – Francis Hauksbee, English scientific instrument maker and experimentalist (born 1660)
* April (end) – Edmund Dummer, English naval engineer (born 1651)
* July 7 – Henry Compton, English bishop and botanist (born 1632)
* August 26 (&quot;bur.&quot;) – Denis Papin, French-born physicist, mathematician and inventor (born 1647)
* October 20 – Archibald Pitcairne, Scottish physician (born 1652)

<text>The Minister for Foreign Affairs () is the foreign minister of Sweden and the head of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

The current Minister for Foreign Affairs is Maria Malmer Stenergard of the Moderate Party.

==History==
The office was instituted in 1809 as a result of the constitutional Instrument of Government promulgated in the same year. Until 1876 the office was called Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs (, commonly known as &quot;utrikesstatsminister&quot;), similar to the office of Prime Minister for Justice (). The Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs initially served as head of the Cabinet of Foreign Mail Exchange at the Royal Office. Following the ministry reform in 1840, the Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs became head of the newly instituted Ministry for Foreign Affairs. In 1876 the office proper of Prime Minister of Sweden was created and at the same time the Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs was nominally demoted to a mere Minister. The holder of the office did however continue to be styled as &quot;Your excellency&quot;, until 1974 when the new Instrument of Government came into force. Before the parliamentary breakthrough in the early 20th century, that title had been granted exclusively to members of the most prominent noble families.

<doc id="462053" wikidata="Q3272438" url="?curid=462053" title="M. J. Coldwell">
<text>Major James William Coldwell (December 2, 1888 – August 25, 1974) was a Canadian democratic socialist politician, and leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) party from 1942 to 1960.

Born in England, he immigrated to Canada in 1910. Prior to his political career, he was an educator and union activist. In 1935, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the Rosetown—Biggar electoral district in Saskatchewan. He was re-elected five times before he was defeated in the 1958 Diefenbaker sweep. He became the CCF&#x27;s first national secretary in 1934 and became its national leader upon the death of J. S. Woodsworth in 1942. He remained leader until 1960, when there was a parliamentary caucus revolt against him. When the CCF disbanded in 1961, he joined its successor, the New Democratic Party.

Coldwell is remembered mainly for helping to introduce &quot;welfare state&quot; policies to Canada, by persuading the Canadian government to introduce an Old Age Security programme and child benefits during the mid-1940s. He turned down several offers to join the governing Liberal Party of Canada, including one offer that would have made him Prime Minister. After his defeat in 1958, he was offered an appointment to the Senate, but he declined this as well. In 1964 he was sworn into the Privy Council, and in 1967 he was one of the initial inductees into the Order of Canada.

==Early life==
Coldwell was born in Seaton, England on December 2, 1888. He attended Exeter University (then called Royal Albert Memorial College), where he met Norah Gertrude Dunsford in 1907, and in December 1909, they became engaged. Norah was born in 1888 and was the daughter of a wealthy newspaper proprietor, John Thomas Dunsford. Coldwell left in February 1910 to teach in Canada&#x27;s Prairie provinces. He became a school teacher in New Norway, Alberta, and returned to the United Kingdom during summer break in 1912. He and Norah were married at the Wembdon Church in Bridgwater, Somerset, England, on July 22. They honeymooned in England for two weeks and then sailed to Canada, where he continued teaching in Sedley, Saskatchewan. He was known nationally as a leader of teachers&#x27; associations from 1924 to 1934.

==Early political career==
He first ran for the Canadian House of Commons as a Progressive candidate in Regina in the 1925 federal election but was defeated. He was elected as a city councillor for Regina City Council and developed links with labour and farmers&#x27; organizations.

In 1926, Coldwell organized the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in Saskatchewan. In 1929, The Farmers&#x27; Political Association and the ILP nominated three candidates for the provincial election, under the joint banner of the Saskatchewan Farmer–Labour party, with Coldwell leading it. The party fought the 1934 provincial election under Coldwell&#x27;s leadership, and it won five seats in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, making it the official opposition to the Liberal government. Coldwell himself was defeated in his bid for office. After the election, the party affiliated itself with the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and became the Saskatchewan CCF.

==Elected MP==
In 1934, Coldwell became the CCF&#x27;s first national secretary. In the 1935 federal election, he was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Rosetown-Biggar. He also served as the CCF&#x27;s national chairman from 1938 to 1942. He split with CCF leader J. S. Woodsworth when World War II broke out in 1939. Woodsworth, a pacifist, opposed the war effort, while Coldwell and the rest of the CCF caucus supported it, as per the party&#x27;s official position.

==CCF leader==
Following Woodsworth&#x27;s stroke in 1940, Coldwell was appointed parliamentary leader of the CCF while Woodsworth remained the party&#x27;s honorary president. In July 1942, three months after Woodsworth&#x27;s death, Coldwell was unanimously elected the CCF&#x27;s new leader at the party&#x27;s convention. He led the party through five general elections. After an upsurge of support for the party in the mid-1940s, the party embarked on a long decline during the Cold War. The Liberals appropriated many of the CCF&#x27;s policies and made them government policy. Liberal governments implemented unemployment insurance, family allowances, and universal old age pensions, stealing much of the CCF&#x27;s thunder and causing the party&#x27;s electoral fortunes to turn downward during the prosperous 1950s. Coldwell cared much more that his party&#x27;s policies were becoming law than that he and the CCF received little credit for them.

In 1945, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King offered Coldwell a Cabinet post in his government. When Coldwell refused, King made another offer, which would have made him the next Liberal leader and, by extension, Prime Minister. Coldwell again refused, mainly out of loyalty to his party and its principles, and he stated that, &quot;if the country needed me in the Prime Minister&#x27;s chair, then it would be at the head of a Co-operative Commonwealth Federation government and not as a member of a party with views and politics contradictory to those in which I believed.&quot; Rumours that King made Coldwell an offer became public during the 1946 by-election campaign in Parkdale. On October 11, at a rally for the CCF&#x27;s by-election candidate, Ford Brand, at Parkdale Collegiate Institute, a member of the audience asked Coldwell about the rumour that he had been offered the leadership of the Liberal Party. Coldwell responded by stating that there had been no official offer and that &quot;the Liberals thought they could buy Coldwell. Coldwell is not for sale.&quot;

===1945 elections: disappointment and defeat===

Coldwell and the rest of the CCF were looking forward to the federal and Ontario elections of 1945, which would possibly be the most crucial to Canada in the 20th century. They took place at the beginning of the welfare state and set the course of political thought to the end of the century and beyond. The year was a disaster for the CCF, both nationally and in Ontario, which Coldwell and the CCF&#x27;s main players realized at the time. The CCF never fully recovered and, in 1961, it would disband and be replaced by the New Democratic Party. As NDP strategist and historian Gerald Caplan put it: &quot;June 4 [Ontario], and June 11 [Canada], 1945, proved to be black days in CCF annals: socialism was effectively removed from the Canadian political agenda.&quot;

The antisocialist crusade by the Ontario Conservative Party, mostly credited to the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) special investigative branch&#x27;s agent D-208 (Captain William J. Osborne-Dempster) and the Conservative propagandists Gladstone Murray and Montague A. Sanderson, diminished the CCF&#x27;s initially favourable position both provincially and nationally: the September 1943 Gallup poll showed the CCF leading nationally with 29 per cent support, with the Liberals and the Conservatives tied for second place at 28 per cent. By April 1945, the CCF was down to 20 per cent nationally, and on election day it received only 16 per cent.

Another factor in the CCF&#x27;s defeat was the unofficial coalition between the Liberal Party of Canada and the communist Labor-Progressive Party which guaranteed a split in the left-of-centre vote.

===Leadership succession crisis===
Coldwell had a moderating influence on party policy, and at the party&#x27;s biannual convention in Winnipeg in 1956, the party passed the Winnipeg Declaration as a statement of party principles to replace the more radical Regina Manifesto. He pushed the party to accept the private sector in a mixed economy in the hope that the new principles would make the CCF more electable.

In the 1958 election, Coldwell lost his seat in the House of Commons, and the party was reduced to a rump of eight MPs. The new Progressive Conservative Prime Minister, John Diefenbaker, offered him an appointment to the Senate, which he declined. After the election, Coldwell often considered resigning the CCF leadership, but the party executive repeatedly dissuaded him from doing so. However, the party needed a leader in the House of Commons, and the CCF parliamentary caucus chose Hazen Argue to fill this role. During the lead-up to the 1960 CCF convention, Argue pressed Coldwell to step down. The leadership challenge jeopardized plans for an orderly transition to the new party that was being planned by the CCF and the Canadian Labour Congress. CCF national president David Lewis, who succeeded Coldwell as president in 1958, when the national chairman and national president positions were merged, and the rest of the new party&#x27;s organizers both opposed Argue&#x27;s manoeuvres and wanted Saskatchewan premier Tommy Douglas to be the new party&#x27;s leader. In an attempt to prevent their plans from derailing, Lewis tried to persuade Argue not to force a vote at the convention on the question of the party&#x27;s leadership. The vote went ahead, and there was a split between the parliamentary caucus and the party executive on the convention floor. Coldwell stepped down as leader, and Argue replaced him, becoming the party&#x27;s final national leader.
As far back as 1941, Coldwell wanted Douglas to succeed him as leader of the national CCF, notwithstanding his willingness to assume the national leadership himself. In 1961, with the formation of the &quot;New Party&quot;, Coldwell put pressure on Douglas to run for the leadership. Coldwell did not trust Argue, and many in the CCF leadership thought that Argue had been holding secret meetings with the Liberals to merge the &quot;New Party&quot; with the Liberal Party. Also, Coldwell and Douglas thought that Lewis could not defeat Argue because he had no parliamentary seat and, probably more importantly, his role as party disciplinarian over the years had made him too many enemies. Douglas, after much consultation, with Coldwell, Lewis, and his caucus, reluctantly decided in June 1961 to contest the leadership of the New Party. He handily defeated Argue on August 3, 1961. Six months later Argue crossed the floor and became a Liberal.

Coldwell was unenthusiastic about the movement to merge the CCF with the Canadian Labour Congress and create the &quot;New Party&quot;, but he joined the New Democratic Party at its founding in 1961, and remained an elder statesman in the NDP until his death in 1974.

==Later life==
In 1964, he became a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada, thereby allowing him to be referred to by the honorific &quot;The Honourable&quot; for the rest of his life. Also in 1964, he was appointed to the House of Commons Advisory Committee on Election Finances chaired by Liberal cabinet minister Judy LaMarsh. In 1966, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson appointed him to the Royal Commission on Security (the Mackenzie Commission), dealing with the RCMP and security issues that arose from the Munsinger Affair. When Douglas retired as the NDP&#x27;s leader in April 1971, the party established the Douglas–Coldwell Foundation in Ottawa as its parting gift to both men. The foundation&#x27;s mandate was to be an intellectual thinktank that formulated ideas and policies for the NDP. On November 5, 1972, Coldwell was honoured by St. Francis Xavier University with a Doctor of Laws degree.

On July 6, 1967, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada. He was invested into the order on November 24, 1967, for &quot;his contribution as a Parliamentarian.&quot; It is noteworthy that his Order of Canada medal was sold at auction in 1981, the first time the Order of Canada is known to have been sold. His will did not specify in what manner to dispose of his various medals, so his son sold them to a private collector, who put them up for auction. That same year, the Douglas-Coldwell Foundation purchased the medals back for about $10,000 so that they could be displayed in the Tommy Douglas House museum in Regina.

His health deteriorated in his final years, and he lived alone in his home in Ottawa, with the assistance of his housekeeper, Beatrice Bramwell. He died at age 85 in the Ottawa Civic Hospital after having suffered two heart attacks on August 25, 1974. He had given orders not to perform &quot;heroic measures&quot; to keep him alive.

He is portrayed in the 2006 CBC Television special &quot;Prairie Giant: The Tommy Douglas Story&quot; by Aidan Devine.

<text>Blue Peacock, renamed from Blue Bunny and originally Brown Bunny, was a British tactical nuclear weapon project in the 1950s.

The project&#x27;s goal was to store a number of ten-kiloton nuclear land mines in Germany. These mines were intended to be placed on the North German Plain and detonated by wire or an eight-day timer in the event of Soviet invasion from the east. 

==Design==
Blue Peacock was designed after the free-falling Blue Danube and weighed 7.2 long tons (7,300 kg). A total of two firing units were built: the casing and the warhead. Due to its large steel casing, it had to be tested outdoors in a flooded gravel pit near Sevenoaks in Kent.
Since the bomb would be unattended, anti-tampering devices were also used. The casing was pressurized, and pressure and tilt switches were added. The warhead could be detonated via three methods: a wire located away, an eight-day timer, or anti-tampering devices. Once armed, Blue Peacock would detonate ten seconds after being moved, if the casing lost pressure, or if it was filled with water.

==Project history==
The project was developed at the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment (RARDE) at Fort Halstead in Kent in 1954.

In July 1957 the British Army ordered ten Blue Peacocks for use in Germany, under the cover story that they were atomic power units for troops in the field. In the end, though, the Ministry of Defence cancelled the project in February 1958. It was judged that the risks posed by the nuclear fallout and the political aspects of preparing for destruction and contamination of allied territory were too high to justify.

==Chicken-powered nuclear bomb==
A technical problem is that during winter, the temperature of buried devices can drop quickly, creating a possibility that the mechanisms of the mine will cease working due to low temperatures in the winter. Various methods were studied to solve this problem, such as wrapping the bombs in insulating blankets.

One proposal suggested that live chickens would be sealed inside the casing, with a supply of food and water. They would remain alive for approximately a week. Their body heat would apparently have been sufficient to keep the mine&#x27;s components at a working temperature. This proposal was sufficiently outlandish that it was taken as an April Fool&#x27;s Day joke when the Blue Peacock file was declassified on 1 April 2004. Tom O&#x27;Leary, head of education and interpretation at the National Archives, replied to the media that, &quot;It does seem like an April Fool but it most certainly is not. The Civil Service does not do jokes.&quot;

<text>The Tünel (, designated as the F2 line on the Istanbul transport map) is a historic, underground, rubber-tyred funicular line in Istanbul, Turkey. It has two stations, connecting Karaköy and Beyoğlu. The tunnel runs uphill from near the confluence of the Golden Horn with the Bosphorus and is about long. It was inaugurated on 17 January 1875.

==History==
In the second half of the 19th century the neighbourhoods of Pera (modern day Beyoğlu) and Galata (modern day Karaköy) had become the financial and commercial heart of Constantinople (modern day Istanbul) and the Ottoman Empire. Many Ottoman and foreign companies, mostly banks and insurance companies, set up their headquarters in these two neighbourhoods. Foreign embassies, hotels and commercial markets in Pera were located at the top of a steep hill while the stock exchange, banks and ports in Galata were at the bottom. Travelling between these two districts was challenging, since grades were as steep as 24%. The main street between these two areas, Yüksek Kaldırım (High Pavement) Avenue, saw an average of 40,000 people walking up and down it daily.

In 1867 a French engineer, Eugène-Henri Gavand, went to Istanbul, (Constantinople) as a tourist. During his visit, he was taken aback to see the number of people struggling up and down Yüksek Kaldırım Avenue. Gavand came up with the idea of building a funicular railway that would ascend and descend the hill and went back to France shortly after to prepare his project. He returned to Constantinople in February 1868 to present his project to the Sublime Porte. The railway would start from near Yüksek Kaldırım Avenue at a point close to the Galata Bridge in Galata.

On 10 June 1869 Sultan Abdülaziz granted Gavand a concession to build the railway. He worked with shareholders in France to start a company to build the railway, but eventually the Prussian invasion of France made the formation of a French-based company impossible.

During the war, Gavand went to the United Kingdom and formed the &quot;Metropolitan Railway of Constantinople&quot; to develop the line. Construction began on 30 July 1871 but was delayed by conflicts between landowners and the company. The tunnel was not completed until December 1874, and finally opened for service on 17 January 1875. Gavand was notably absent at the opening ceremony.

The Metropolitan Railway company gained a fresh 75-year concession in 1904. In 1911, after some alterations, the rights to the Tünel were transferred to the new multinational consortium, &quot;Union Ottoman Société d&#x27;Intrepises Electriques à Constantinople&quot;. which encompassed the Tünel, the trams, and the Ottoman Joint Stock Electric Company. In 1939 it was absorbed into the new IETT (İstanbul Elektrik Tramvay ve Tünel) transport organisation. 

In 1968 the Tünel was closed for renovation. In 1971 it reopened, having been modernised and electrified. In 2007 the Tünel was restored again to strengthen its seismic resistance in a city prone to earthquakes. 

Today, the short line is still a crucial component of the municipal transport network.

==Description==

The Tünel consists of a single brick-lined tunnel measuring long, wide and high. It has one station at either end:
* Karaköy — the lower station, located at the eastern end of Tersane Avenue
* Tünel — the upper station on Tünel Square (&quot;Tünel Meydanı&quot;), located at the southern end of Istiklal Avenue

The upper station stands above the lower one.

The gradient of the tunnel varies along its length from 2 percent to 15 percent. Originally built with two parallel tracks, the modern Tünel has a single track with a passing loop in the middle, a short duplex section, where two trains pass side by side.

==Rolling stock==

The original rolling stock consisted of two wooden two-car trains. One car was reserved for passengers, with its two classes provided divided into separate sections for men and women. The other car was used to transport goods, animals and carts. Motive power was provided by steam engines.

The wooden carriages were replaced in 1971 with two electrified steel cars running on pneumatic tires over concrete tracks, thus similarly to the rubber-tyred metro it could be called a &quot;rubber-tyred funicular&quot;.

In 2007 a new generation of a rolling stock was brought into operation. Today each car can carry 170 passengers and travels at a maximum speed of . A trip from top to bottom takes about 1.5 minutes, with normal waiting time 3.5 minutes. In 2021 the first female driver joined the staff of the Tünel.

<text>Rhona Natasha Mitra (born 9 August 1976) is a British actress.

Mitra is known for her roles as Sonja in &quot;&quot; (2009); as Major Rachel Dalton on the second and third seasons of &quot;Strike Back&quot; (2012–2013); as Rachel Scott in the first two seasons of &quot;The Last Ship&quot; (2014–2015); Holly Marie Begins on the sixth season of &quot;Party of Five&quot; (1999–2000); as Kate Hedges in &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot; (2002); as Tara Wilson on the final season of &quot;The Practice&quot; (2003–2004) and the first and second seasons of &quot;Boston Legal&quot; (2004–2005); as Detective Kit McGraw on the third season of &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; (2005); in the lead role of the science fiction/action film &quot;Doomsday&quot; as Major Eden Sinclair (2008); as an assassin in the Netflix film &quot;Game Over, Man!&quot; (2018); and as Mercy Graves in the CW series &quot;Supergirl&quot; (2018).

==Early life==
Rhona Mitra was born in 1976 in the Paddington area of London, the daughter of Anthony Mitra, a surgeon, and Nora Downey. Her father is of Bengali Indian and English descent, while her mother is Irish.

==Career==
In 1997, Mitra appeared as the live-action model for Lara Croft, the lead character in Eidos Interactive&#x27;s &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; video game series before Angelina Jolie took the role for the two &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; films (2001–2003). She played the romantic interest of Christopher Lambert in &quot;Beowulf&quot; (1999). Her first main role came as Scott Wolf&#x27;s illicit love interest on &quot;Party of Five&quot; (1999–2000). In 2000, Mitra had a small role in the film &quot;Hollow Man&quot; as a neighbour who is raped by Kevin Bacon&#x27;s character. She had a main role in the medical drama &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Crossing&quot; (2001), as Alejandra &quot;Ollie&quot; Klein. Mitra was ranked No. 46 on the &quot;Maxim&quot; Hot 100 Women of 2001. Mitra then had roles in &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot;, &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; (2002), &quot;Stuck on You&quot;, &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; (2003), and leading roles in &quot;Highwaymen&quot; and &quot;Spartacus&quot; (2004). Mitra appeared in the final season of &quot;The Practice&quot; (2003) as Tara Wilson, and continued that role into its spin-off &quot;Boston Legal&quot; (2004–2005) with James Spader, but left not long into the second season. In 2005, Mitra played the role of Kit McGraw during season 3 of &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;. Mitra then went on to appear in &quot;Skinwalkers&quot; (2006), &quot;The Number 23&quot; and &quot;Shooter&quot; (2007).

In 2008, Mitra starred in the lead role of the science fiction/action film &quot;Doomsday&quot; as Major Eden Sinclair (sometimes mistakenly named in some databases as being Caryn Peterson), and in 2009 went on to star in &quot;&quot; as Sonja, the daughter of the powerful vampire elder Viktor (played by Bill Nighy). While filming, she grew fond of her vampire fangs, even declining to remove them when they could not be seen. &quot;I put those fangs on the first day and I felt they should always have been there; it&#x27;s strange.

<doc id="462072" wikidata="Q1740762" url="?curid=462072" title="Kiama, New South Wales">
<text>Kiama () is a coastal town 120 kilometres south of Sydney in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia. One of the main tourist attractions is the Kiama Blowhole. Kiama features several popular surfing beaches and caravan parks, and numerous alfresco cafes and restaurants. Its proximity to the south of Sydney makes it an attractive destination for many day-trippers and weekenders. Kiama also has historically been a farming and agricultural centre. Even to today it maintains a country and agricultural community with a weekly farmers markets held on Wednesday afternoons.

==History==
Kiama was the site of two strong volcanic flows, called the Gerringong Volcanics, which came out of Saddleback Mountain, now a collapsed volcanic vent. The Kiama Blowhole is part of an erosion process on the more recent rock, formed into columnar basalt, or latite. Before the cedar-getters (comprising ex-convicts, convicts and runaways, some with cedar licences and many without) arrived in the area around 1810, the local Indigenous Australians, Wodi Wodi of the language group Dharawal, had been using the land for thousands of years, moving every six weeks or so in family groups. This is supported by a midden of shells at nearby Bass Point used for more than 17,000 years. During this time the whole coastal hills was covered in rainforest and cedar brush. There is evidence of a flourishing culture with intricate possum cloaks, a developed song and story cycle, and a deep understanding of the many plants of the rainforest. Only a few remnants of rainforest survive along the escarpment in places like the Minnamurra Rainforest Centre.

There is strong evidence of recent sea debris showing a mega-tsunami hit this coast around 1487 A.D according to Dr Ted Bryant of Wollongong University. The first European to explore the area was George Bass who stopped there on 6 December 1797 and viewed Kiama&#x27;s blowhole.

During the early settlement of eastern Australia, the Kiama area was settled by wheat farmers, since the soil was volcanic and rain-swept unlike most of Australia. Early Jamberoo was the population centre from about 1830 to the 1860s and when the wheat failed to grow, the farmers switched to dairying. During this period, Kiama became the best example of &#x27;chain migration&#x27; in Australia as many assisted migrants came from Northern Ireland on clearing leases and eventually half the marriages in the Kiama Anglican Church in a hundred years had Northern Irish Protestant ancestry. Kiama was one of the birthplaces of the Australian dairy industry with the first Dairy Factory (The Kiama Pioneer Factory) and first Dairy Co-operative in Australia. There were three original major land grants, Thomas Surfleet Kendall (son of lapsed missionary Reverend Thomas Kendall), Michael Hindmarsh and Matthew Cignarella, all of which married sisters of the Rutter family. The Kendalls were cousins of Henry Kendall, the famous Australian poet. The Kendall name is remembered today in several places such as the spooky Kendall Cemetery in Kiama Heights and Kendalls Beach. The Hindmarshs are remembered in Kiama&#x27;s main park, Hindmarsh Park, and after 10 generations still live on their original land.

Kiama&#x27;s next population boom was powered by its quarries, which multiplied rapidly in the early years of the 20th century. Many Irish Catholics worked in the Kiama quarries. The basalt formed by two volcanic eruptions 240 million years and 66 million years ago was a valuable commodity for a growing colony, with the blue metal used to pave Sydney&#x27;s roads and as ballast for its railways. It was very similar to the basalt found in Northern Ireland, where the Giant&#x27;s Causeway is a famous example. There are still active quarries in the Kiama area, including the N.S.W. Railway Quarry, and the remnants of earlier quarries are easily visible throughout the town and often have facilities built inside them such as the Kiama Leisure Centre. One particular quarry, the Bombo Headland, is of scientific importance as it is the site of the discovery of the longest known geomagnetic polarity interval called the Kiaman Reverse Superchron.

When Kiama Harbour was hollowed out after 17 years&#x27; work, and flooded in 1876, larger steamers such as from the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company could enter and a flourishing sea trade followed. Staithes for loading crushed blue metal stone directly into ships from rail trucks were installed along the eastern end of the harbour, allowing regular shipments to be taken to Sydney for the railways and road construction. The ships that carried the blue metal to Sydney were known colloquially as the &quot;Stone Fleet&quot;. It was a prosperous and happy time well recorded in the local newspaper, the Kiama Independent and the photographs of the Cocks Photographic Studio, two valuable resources which tell most of the Kiama story.

Over time tourism and housing growth turned Kiama into a dormitory suburb (where people travelled away to work) and summer tourist spot. Kiama in 2009 is a tourism haven in summer, during which its population triples. The Kiama Pilot&#x27;s Cottage is now a local history museum. Nearby, on Black Beach, is a memorial to the blue metal freighter SS Bombo, which capsized and sank outside Port Kembla harbour in a huge gale after departing Kiama for Sydney on 24 February 1949. Twelve of the fourteen crew were lost.

A tornado ripped through parts of Kiama in February 2013, damaging about 75 homes.

== Heritage listings ==

Kiama has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 24–40 and 42–44 Collins Street: Collins Street wooden terraces, Kiama
* 46 Collins Street: Kiama Masonic Temple
* Illawarra railway: Kiama railway station
* Irvine Street: Kiama Reservoirs
* 16–20 Manning Street: CBC Bank Building
* Shoalhaven Street: Scots Presbyterian Church
* 24 Terralong Street: Kiama Post Office

== Geography ==
The Kiama area includes many attractions, being situated on the coast south of the Minnamurra River, and to the west lie the foothills of Saddleback Mountain and the smaller less discernible peak of Mount Brandon. Also to the west is the town of Jamberoo with pasture-land in between, which contains many historic buildings and dry stone walls. 

Also of note is Seven Mile Beach to the south, a protected reserve. Kiama has several well-known surfing beaches, including Surf Beach, &#x27;Mystics&#x27; and Boyds&#x27; Beach, as well as other more protected swimming beaches situated in coves between headlands such as Black Beach, Easts Beach and Kendalls Beach. Kiama Harbour forms one of several coves between headlands. 

The southern extreme of the subtropical rainforest is generally said to finish in the Kiama area, though several rainforest species reach their southern boundary at Mount Dromedary, around south of Kiama. 

===Climate===
Kiama is the northern edge of the oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), bordering on a humid subtropical climate. with warm summers and mild winters. Rainfall is spread relatively evenly throughout the year with the wettest months being in autumn and the driest in spring.

== Population ==

At the , Kiama had a population of 7,904. 
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 2.2% of the population. 
* 78.0% of people were born in Australia; the next most common countries of birth were England 6.3%, New Zealand 1.4%, the United States of America 0.9%, Scotland 0.8% and Germany 0.7%. 
* 89.0% of people only spoke English at home; the next most common languages spoken at home included Mandarin 0.5%, Spanish 0.5%, Greek 0.4%, German 0.4% and Cantonese 0.4%. 
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 40.0%, Catholic 22.0%, Anglican 17.6% and Uniting Church 3.1%, a further 6.4% of respondents elected not to disclose their religion.

==Transport==
The town is served by Kiama railway station, the last station to be electrified on the Illawarra railway line; the journey to Sydney takes about 2 hours 15 minutes. By road, Kiama is about 55 minutes from the southern edge of Sydney, and 100 minutes from Sydney CBD, via the Princes Highway.

Kiama was served by two tramways built to connect the Pike&#x27;s Hill quarries west of the town with the harbour traversing Terralong Street. The first was built in 1885 but never opened after financial problems were encountered with the tracks lifted in 1889. A second gauge line operated from 1914 until 1941.

== Attractions ==
The beaches around Kiama offer a large range of surfing conditions. Many surfing competitions are held here every year. These include Boyds Beach – Kiama Downs, Bombo Beach – Bombo, Surf Beach – Kiama, Easts Beach and Caravan Park – Kiama Heights, Kendalls Beach – Kiama and Mystics Beach – Minnamurra River.

The name &quot;Kiama&quot; is derived from the Aboriginal word &quot;kiarama&quot;, which means &quot;Place where the sea makes a noise&quot;. Kiama is also known as the place where the mountains touch the sea. This is in reference to the Kiama Blowhole which attracts many visitors annually. The &quot;Little Blowhole&quot; is a lesser known blowhole as it does not share the same central location or the scale associated with the larger Kiama Blowhole. The Little Blowhole is on a headland south of the central part of Kiama between Easts and Kendalls Beaches.

Both have areas for viewing, though the Kiama Blowhole attracts more tourists. A coastal walking track currently allows people to walk from Minnamurra to Easts Beach, past both blowholes. A 7 kilometre southern extension to this path has been opened to allow people to walk along the cliffs to Gerringong.

A few kilometres north at Bombo is Cathedral Rocks, a formation well known and visited, with a walk/cycleway going along the Kiama coast. There are other rock formations on these cliff headlands of moderate renown.

The Kiama Post Office, one of many historic buildings, is known for its history and pink colour, although it was repainted in 2012. It is situated near Black Beach.

Kiama has a country-style strip mall of cafés, restaurants, art galleries and shops on Terralong Street. Also on this street is a war memorial, an historic fire station used for exhibits, and a small shopping centre. There is a strong arts following and interest in cultural events in Kiama, and in 2013 an arts trail was introduced to showcase the work of individual artists, together with regular arts events in the area. Food and wine trails are also becoming more popular in the area.Kiama Lighthouse, on Blowhole Point, was built in 1887 and is situated close to the Kiama Blowhole. The point also contains a heritage pilot&#x27;s cottage and a tourist information centre. North West of the Blowhole is Kiama Harbour, home to fishing boats and seafood market where you can buy local fish. The point also contains seaside cabins and a rock pool.

A locally famous phenomenon is the local group of Australian Pelicans. The pelicans have been honoured with a metal statue at the harbour.

Seven kilometres southwest of the town is Saddleback Lookout atop the 600-metre high Saddleback Mountain with views over the Illawarra Plains and escarpment and south to Nowra, Pigeon House Mountain and Coolangatta Mountain. Saddleback and Noorinan mountains provide an impressive backdrop to the city.

The Jamberoo Action Park, a mainly ride-orientated water-themed park, is situated 10 minutes inland of Kiama in the small town of Jamberoo.

West of Kiama in the green hills lies Jerrara Dam, built in the 1800s to supply water to the area. It is now a reserve.

North of the Minnamurra River is Killalea Recreation Area, a nature reserve on Bass Point. It is south of Shellharbour.

Kiama Council spent eleven years preparing the construction of the Kiama Coast Walk, a six-kilometre track extending from Loves Bay, north of Kiama, to Werri Lagoon, near Gerringong, south of Kiama. Some coastal land was declared public reserve to allow the public to walk through what was previously private property. The track was scheduled to open in October 2009 and was expected to be a popular drawcard for the public.

== Education ==
Kiama is home to several schools, including Kiama High School, Kiama Public School and Ss Peter and Paul Catholic School. Two vocational education and training (VET) providers also have their headquarters in Kiama, the Kiama Community College and National Training Masters. The local TAFE NSW College is located at Shellharbour.

<text>The Soap Box Derby is a youth-oriented soap box car racing program, founded in 1934 in the United States by Dayton, OH native Myron Scott, a photojournalist employed by the Dayton Daily News, and preceded by events such as &quot;Kid Auto Races at Venice&quot; in 1914. Proclaimed &quot;the greatest amateur racing event in the world&quot;, the program culminates each July at the FirstEnergy All-American Soap Box Derby World Championship held at Derby Downs in Akron, Ohio, with winners from their local communities travelling from across the US, Canada, Germany and Japan to compete. 2024 marked the 86th running of the All-American since its inception in 1934 in Dayton, Ohio, having missed four years (1942–1945) during World War II and one (2020) during the COVID pandemic. Cars competing in the program race downhill, propelled by gravity alone.

The Soap Box Derby expanded quickly across the US from the very beginning, bolstered largely by a generous financial campaign by its national sponsor, Chevrolet Motor Company. At the same time there was enthusiastic support from coast to coast of numerous local newspapers that published aggressively during the summer months when races were held, with stories boasting of their own community races and of their Champion travelling to Akron with dreams of capturing a National title and hometown glory. In 1936 the All-American had its own purpose-built track constructed at what is now Derby Downs, with some communities across America following suit with tracks of their own.

Its greatest years occurred during the fifties and sixties when viewer turnout at the All-American reached 100,000 spectators, and racer participation was at an all-time high. From the very beginning, technical and car-design innovation happened rapidly, so Derby officials drafted ways of governing the sport so that it did not become too hazardous as speed records were being challenged. At Derby Downs the track length was shortened twice to slow the cars down.

The seventies brought significant changes, beginning with the introduction of girls to the sport in 1971. The following year Chevrolet dropped its sponsorship, sending Derby Downs into a tailspin that threatened its very future. Racer enrollment plummeted the following year. In 1973 a scandal hit Derby Downs with the discovery that their World Champion had cheated, and was thus disqualified, further exacerbating an uncertain future. In 1975 Karren Stead won the World Championship, the first of many girls that would go on to claim the title. Finally there was Derby&#x27;s decision to divide the competition with the introduction of the Junior Division kit cars in 1976.

As fiscal challenges continued, the Derby instituted new guidelines by redrafting the Official race divisions into three: Stock, Super Stock and Masters. With them came the prefabricated fiber glass kit racers which kids could now purchase, this to appeal to a new generation of racers uncomfortable with constructing their own cars from scratch, as well as to help Derby effectively meet its financial obligations. Leading into the 21st century the Soap Box Derby has continued to expand with the inclusion of the Rally Program racers at the All-American in 1993, the creation of the Ultimate Speed Challenge in 2004 and the Legacy Division in 2019.
== Introduction ==

The Soap Box Derby, promoted as &quot;the greatest amateur racing event in the world,&quot; is a largely volunteer-driven, family-oriented sporting activity for youth conducted across the US and around the world. Local or regional races are held yearly, with winners from each sent to compete at the All-American Soap Box Derby World Championship, officially the FirstEnergy All-American Soap Box Derby World Championship, which occurs every July at Derby Downs in Akron, Ohio. Oversight is by the International Soap Box Derby organization, or ISBD, run by a paid administrative staff headquartered at Derby Downs, a term also used metonymically to describe said organization.

The name Soap Box Derby is a registered trademark, and used to identify the sport overall, with those actively involved referring to it simply as &quot;Derby.&quot; The official name FirstEnergy All-American Soap Box Derby is used solely to identify the annual World Championship race itself, and referred to similarly as &quot;the All-American.&quot;

Eligibility to race in the Soap Box Derby is open to anyone aged 7 through 20, with participants divided by age into three Official Divisions, with a specific car design assigned for each: Stock, the entry level division for ages 7–13, Super Stock, for mid-level kids ages 9–18, and Masters, the senior level for ages 10–20 and a design where the occupant rides in the fully reclined position. Cars come un-assembled in kits purchased from the ISBD, the only visibly common component of all three designs being the Official wheels sets which are available for purchase as well.

While working with a mentor is permitted, kids are expected to assemble the cars themselves to develop the skills necessary for the car to pass inspection before they are qualified to race.

== Beginnings ==

Kids playing on home-made scooters and go karts in the 1930s was not an unfamiliar sight in the streets of America, and racing in organized events was an inevitable outcome of it. As early as 1904 Germany conducted its first soapbox race for kids, and in 1914 there was the Junior Vanderbilt Cup in Venice, California that held a kids race as well.

The Soap Box Derby story began on June 10, 1933 when six boys were racing homemade push carts in Dayton, Ohio, among them William Condit whose father suggested they have a race and that he would contact the local newspaper to have them cover it. The other participants were Dean Gattwood, Tracey Geiger Jr., Robert Gravett, James P. Hobstetter and William Pickrel Jr.. Of the six, Condit won that race, with Gravett taking second.

Myron Scott, a 25-year-old photojournalist for the Dayton Daily News looking for ideas for its Sunday Picture Page, was one of two photographers that got the call, and accepting the assignment ventured out to investigate. Seeing the appeal of a kids story like this he asked the boys to return in two weeks with more of their friends so he could host a race of his own. When they did nineteen showed up, bringing with them racers made of packing crates and soap boxes, sheets of tin and whatever else they could find. The race was held on Big Hill Road in Oakwood, a south-side neighborhood of Dayton, with a crowd of onlookers coming to watch. Seizing on a publicity opportunity, Scott decided to plan an even bigger city-wide event with the support of his employer, the Dayton Daily News, which recognized the hope-inspiring and goodwill nature of the story—especially during the Depression. It posted advertisements of it almost daily to stir interest, and included an application which stipulated &quot;for anything on four wheels that will coast&quot; for the kids to fill out. A date was set for August 19, 1933, to host a parade, the race to occur a day after, and the location chosen as Burkhardt Hill, a straight, westbound slope on Burdhardt Ave east of Downtown Dayton.

On the appointed weekend a turnout of 460 kids along with 40,000 onlookers caught everyone by surprise, and Scott knew he was onto something big. From the original 460 cars, 362 were deemed safe enough to participate, including Robert Gravett, the only boy from the original Oakwood six that made an appearance. At day&#x27;s end sixteen year old Randy Custer (pictured), who also hailed from Oakwood, took the championship in his &quot;slashing yellow comet&quot; on three wheels, with eleven year old Alice Johnson—who shocked many when they saw she was a girl after removing her helmet—taking runner-up.

Scott immediately set about making the race an All-American event the following year, and sought a national sponsor, selling the idea successfully to the Chevrolet Motor Company to co-sponsor with the Dayton Daily News. He was also able to induce many newspapers from coast to coast to sponsor local races on the merits that the story would increase circulation. From the photographs taken at the very first race of the six boys, he selected runner-up Robert Gravett&#x27;s entry as the archetypal soap box car, and designed it into the national logo along with the now official name, Soap Box Derby, which became a registered trademark.

=== First All-American ===

The very first All-American Soap Box Derby race was held on August 19, 1934, at the same location as the Dayton city-wide race in 1933, on a track that measured out at 1,980 feet. Watched by a crowd estimated at 45,000, boys from 34 cities competed in the all day affair, with Robert Turner of Muncie, Indiana, piloting a car riding on bare metal wheels with no bearings, becoming the first All-American Champion. Charles Baer of Akron won the All-Ohio Championship, and in a separate race category called Blue Flame for boys aged 16 to 18, Eugene Franke of Dayton, piloting a scaled-down version of a professional motorized racer, took the crown.

In 1935 civic leaders from Akron, Ohio, convinced program organizers to move the event to Akron due to its central location and hilly terrain. A long, eastbound grade on Tallmadge Avenue located at the east end of the city, and the site of 1934 Akron local race, was used for that year&#x27;s national event, and a date was set for August 11, 1935. Scott decided to discontinue the Blue Flame race category as turnout last year was low. Fifty-two champs from across the nation made the trip to Akron, greeted by a throng of 50,000 on race day, with Maurice Bale of Anderson, Indiana, in a sleek, metal-clad racer taking the top prize. One mishap was an accident that captured the public&#x27;s interest, even boosting the event&#x27;s profile worldwide, when a car piloted by Paul Brown of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, went off the track and struck NBC&#x27;s Graham McNamee and Tom Manning while they were broadcasting, an incident that continued being described live on the air as it happened.

=== Marketing the Derby ===

The Soap Box Derby swept across America quickly during the Depression with dreams of winning the All-American becoming quite popular with boys. Within a year of its inauguration tens of thousands of them were constructing racers. The added inducement of winning a college scholarship was also a chance at a more promising future, particularly when life was a challenge for many. Print media made celebrities of Derby champs, their faces appearing on the front page of every newspaper that covered an event.

Chevrolet&#x27;s campaign in promoting the Derby promulgated these ideas. However Chevrolet&#x27;s sponsoring of the All-American was ostensibly a money-making enterprise, and with the Depression well underway by 1934 and programs like the WPA being implemented to bolster the economy, the idea of a kids&#x27; recreational program like the Derby—boys in cars—seemed an excellent marketing opportunity to sell its main product—cars—to their parents. During the Depression kids had little access to organized activities like team sports or television, so getting them get behind a national event like Derby was an easy sell. Chevrolet dealerships acted as agents for the Derby, where kids would go to sign up and purchase wheels and axles to get started on their cars, and since a child was usually accompanied by a parent, what better way to get mom or dad—who waited patiently while their child filled out an application—to check out the latest models in the showroom.

==== Awards ====

Awards at the All-American started with the first-place silver trophy and a four-year college or university scholarship of their choice. Second and third place were awarded a brand new Chevrolet and a smaller silver trophy similar in design to the first place award. Technical awards went to the best constructed (C.F. Kettering Trophy) and best upholstered entries, as well as the car with the best brake. At the local level, boys that won and qualified to attend the All-American were awarded the M. E. Coyle (silver) Trophy, named after Chevrolet General Manager (1933–1946) M. E. Coyle (1888–1961), and a cash prize. Beginning in 1950, they received the T. H. Keating Award plaque, named after Chevrolet Sales Manager T. H. Keating. Technical honors for cars with best construction, best upholstery and best brake were awarded as well.

==== Awards ceremony ====

The climax of each year&#x27;s All-American was the Champions&#x27; victory banquet hosted by Chevrolet, a grand spectacle that culminated in an awards ceremony for the winning boys. Created as a media event, the dinner was inaugurated in 1935 at the Mayflower Hotel in downtown Akron when the city first became host to the All-American. It was eventually held at the larger Goodyear Hall gymnasium, and was attended by up to three-thousand guests. Attendees included the racers themselves, who were treated like royalty, seated on a large multi-tiered stage before an audience of family members and volunteers. Seated with them where the Derby officials and attending dignitaries who, from the podium on the highest part of the stage, handed out the awards.

=== Derby Downs ===
Because of the growing popularity of the event, a larger and more permanent home was needed, and a dedicated track was constructed in 1936. Chief among those that spearheaded the project were Bain &quot;Shorty&quot; Fulton, manager of Akron&#x27;s Fulton Airport, and Jim Schlemmer, sports editor of the &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot;. A site was chosen by the airport, a tract of land occupied at the time by a ski slope, which the City of Akron agreed to lease to the Soap Box Derby organization for $1 per year. Following its announcement on July 29, 1936, construction began on a paved track with landscaping, installation of the rented grandstands and bleachers, and the erection of a wooden, two-deck bridge over the finish line, all by WPA workers. Of the 1,600 feet, of it was the race course, with the top staging area and bottom run-out comprising the remainder. Extensive infrastructural provisions were made for the expected media as well.

Exactly three weeks later, on August 16, 1936, the first All-American at Derby Downs (officially the 3rd All-American) was run. A pre-race parade with 11 bands entertained a throng of nearly 100,000 who were welcomed officially by Governor Martin L. Davey and Mayor Lee D. Schroy. Competing in the race were 116 boys from across America and one from South Africa, making this the first World Championship. Witnessed by a cadre of 500 media personal from around the globe was 3rd All-American Champion Herbert Muench Jr. 14, of St. Louis, Missouri taking home the top prize of a $2,000 four-year college scholarship.

==== Enrollment on the rise ====

Now that Derby had a home it was able to cater to the increasing participation of still more communities organizing additional local races and sending champs of their own. At the Inaugural All-American the number of boys that entered was 34, but by 1936 that number had exploded to 116. In 1939 there were 176 cities that wanted to participate, but due to Derby Downs&#x27; limit to just 120 cars at the time, some communities had to double up or hold regional races to send just one boy representing multiple communities instead of two or more. Even by 1935 there were an estimated 50,000 boys across America that were already building cars to participate.

In 1940 the popularity of the sport meant that the All-American would accommodate 130 cars from around the world, increasing to 148 by the end of the decade. In 1959 that number was raised to 170, and by 1969 a total of 257 cars came to Akron. Today the All-American comprises three Official Divisions across numerous race programs, and in 2023 reached 320 participants.

== Classic Derby ==
Following WWII and a return home of its service personnel, America embraced a new optimism and chance for greater prosperity, thanks partly to the G.I. Bill introduced in 1944. In 1946 the Soap Box Derby returned as well, and Chevrolet wasted no time in marketing the Derby with the same amount of pomp and pageantry it lavished upon the boys half a decade earlier. By now the Derby was an obsession for boys who entered, with thoughts of nothing better than to construct a car in the hopes of making it to Akron. Considered to be Soap Box Derby&#x27;s heyday or &quot;golden age,&quot; attendance at the All-American routinely reached 70,000 each year. The fanfare surrounding the event was a &quot;big deal&quot; back in the day &quot;when Chevrolet handled the race,&quot; said Derby historian and author Ron Reed, who went to his first All-American in 1949 as a boy. &quot;The crowd was always on their feet when the hometown kid went down the hill,&quot; so one &quot;had to stand or they couldn&#x27;t see anything.&quot; The cheering was so loud that the announcer calling out the driver&#x27;s names over the loudspeakers could not be heard. It was &quot;exciting,&quot; said Reed.

With each year, Derby regulations were amended and standardized to ensure the safety of drivers. After the war the use of windscreens on cars were still allowed, but by 1948 they were banned outright. Wheels were also standardized with the introduction of the Official Soap Box Derby Tire and axle set that a boy could purchase at his neighborhood Chevy dealership. Weight and dimension restrictions of the car remained generally the same during this time, but as more subtle rules changes were being introduced by the late sixties, car designs became more creative or ingenious in response.

=== Parade of celebrities ===

Part of the attraction of the All-American was the parade of Hollywood and well-known celebrities that made appearances annually. Names like Abbot and Costello, the cast from TV&#x27;s Bewitched, Lorne Greene and the cast from Bonanza, Rock Hudson, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Roy Rogers, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Stewart, and Adam West were promoted by Chevrolet leading up to the race. Jimmy Stewart made the most appearances in Akron, six in all—1947–1950, 1952 and 1957. On the occasion of his first visit he called it &quot;The most magnificent spectacle I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Into the 1970s, other celebrities included Peter Fonda, George Takei and Tom Hanks.

==== Oil Can Trophy Race ====

Added to the pre-race pageantry at the 1950 All-American was the Oil Can Trophy Race, an exhibition event that pitted three of the guest celebrities against one another in a downhill heat. Each got to pilot a unique and often outlandishly-designed racer made from an oil drum, for a novelty prize called the Oil Can Trophy. Jack Dempsey, Wilbur Shaw and Jimmy Stewart were contestants in the inaugural race, with Dempsey taking the prize. The race was popular with the crowd and kept in the program. When Stewart returned in 1957 for his sixth All-American appearance, he made his third try for the Oil Can Trophy, this time against George Montgomery and Roy Rogers, with Montgomery taking the prize. Having never won after his final attempt, Stewart joked &quot;Always a bridesmaid.&quot; In 1962 it was Lorne Greene that beat fellow cast mates Michael Landon and Dan Blocker in a Bonanza-themed showdown, and in 1980 Christopher George won out over wife Linda Day George and actor Bill Daily. Ostensibly lighthearted in tone, the celebs usually played to the crowd for laughs. The spectacle continued into the 2000s.

=== In the face of adversity ===

A boy&#x27;s climb from relative obscurity to national fame after winning the All-American usually made the front page of newspapers from coast to coast, some reaching legendary status depending on just how interesting the climb was, or how much adversity they had to overcome to get there.

==== The Graphite Kid ====

One such boy is Gilbert Klecan, age 14, the first World Champion following the Second World War, racing a laminate-constructed racer fitted with a streamlined windscreen and equipped with vertical steering of a unique design. A family friend named Chuck Boswell, an aerospace engineer at Convair, told Gil about the San Diego Derby and suggested he build a car that he offered to design. Accepting his offer, Gil entered the 1946 race but in an unpainted car, having just completed it the night before. Winning in San Diego, Gil became eligible to race in Akron, where his car was quickly sent while still being unpainted. When he arrived he hastily painted it before it was lettered, but felt it did little to make it smoother, so Boswell handed him a can of graphite paste, a dry lubricant, to rub all over it in the hopes that it would make the car slicker. While doing so he managed to get some on his clothes and face, giving him the look of a chimney sweep. When Gil emerged the winner at the All-American, the press eagerly snapped photos of the cheerful champ with the blackened face, dubbing him the &quot;Graphite Kid.&quot; His photo appeared in Life Magazine.

The next day a film crew wanted to capture Gil racing down the hill, having him trail behind a pickup truck where the camera was mounted. When the director yelled &quot;stop!,&quot; meaning &quot;cut!,&quot; the driver of the truck heeded, while Gil, unaware, continued headlong into rear bumper, injuring his back and landing him in the hospital for a week. Gil eventually recovered.

Graphite use continued the following year with boys like class B entrant John Englert of Iowa City, Iowa, even dusting his car with talcum powder over the graphite, and fellow racer Craig Penney who followed Gil&#x27;s example by blackening his face. New regulations in 1948 banned its use anywhere on the car or driver. Even having graphite on one&#x27;s person was grounds for disqualification. Gil wrote an article that appeared in Mechanix Illustrated in May 1947 which featured construction blueprints of his racer, with details of his steering and suspension designs. His car was exhibited in 2017 at the San Diego Automotive Museum in Balboa Park.

==== Ramblin&#x27; Wreck from Georgia ====

A heartwarming story is Joe Lunn, who took the World Championship in 1952. Joe was a small and shy farm boy from a poor family that hailed from Thomasville, Georgia. Visiting uncles from Columbus, Georgia, located northwest of Thomasville, suggested that he enter a goat cart he had built at their local Soap Box Derby race, something Joe knew nothing about. With their help Joe acquired the needed wheels and axles, making changes to the cart to qualify, and signed up as a class B entry at the age of eleven. Arriving on race day, Joe&#x27;s black racer had no sponsor and certainly looked no match against the more experienced racers that did. It was a surprise to many therefore when he took the championship. A month later he was going to Akron. To accompany him his mother Jewell borrowed the $33.87 from her brothers, Joe&#x27;s uncles, for a round-trip bus ticket to Akron, having never been north of Columbus before that time.

When Joe arrived in Akron he admitted that he was most impressed by how big the track at Derby Downs was, being 200 feet longer than Columbus&#x27;, but reasoned that other boys probably felt as scared as he, so he pressed on. In his first heat, his steering cable snapped and he lost control of his car beyond the finish line, striking a guard rail and severely damaging its front end. Joe received a cut across the chest that left a scar and a bump to the head. At this point he was certain that he was out of the race. While being patched up at the first aid station he learned however that he had won, and that his car was being repaired so he could go again, something he was not too keen about.

With race volunteers cobbling together whatever they could find—bailing wire, duct tape, even sheet metal from a flattened lunch box—Joe&#x27;s car was hastily made race-worthy again. Three of the damaged wheels had to be swapped with replacements from an older set from 1947, considered by Derby fans to be some of the fastest wheels ever used on a Derby car. In the four heats that followed Joe would come out on top, each time winning by a larger margin. He remembers seeing pieces of his car fall off as he raced down the track each time, quickly becoming the crowd favorite as they cheered on what was affectionately dubbed &quot;The Ramblin&#x27; Wreck from Georgia Tech.&quot; In his final heat he set the track record that day, taking the Derby crown, and becoming the first Southerner to do so.

Joe never did go to Georgia Tech, joining the US Navy instead and staying on until 1979. His patched-together car, considered the worst-looking winner at the All-American, is on exhibit at the ISBD Hall of Fame Museum in Akron.

==== Doug Hoback ====

A story of courage that made international news was of a boy determined to win one more Soap Box Derby race while battling terminal cancer. Doug Hoback hailed from Valparaiso, Indiana, entering his car as a class B contestant in both the Valparaiso and Gary, Indiana, local races in 1955, winning in Valparaiso and being awarded a brand new bike. In December doctors discovered that Doug had a terminal malignancy, a cancer called lymphosarcoma. His physician, Dr. Leonard Green, stated that all he could do medically was postpone death. Undaunted, Doug expressed his wish that he win next year&#x27;s Soap Box Derby and earn a trip to Akron. &quot;He never gave up,&quot; Green said. On July 4, Doug, now age 13, repeated his win in Valparaiso, this time as a class A entry, and then headed to Gary to compete for the regional title and a chance at Akron. On the day of that race Doug was down 40 pounds from his usual 110-pound weight, and at the time trial run he had to be helped in and out of car due to his weakened condition. When an axle broke halfway down the track, his car veered into the guard rail, ending his chance to compete. Uninjured, he continued to watch the race from the sidelines, seated in his wheelchair. The following day his parents returned from church to find their son&#x27;s condition had worsened. After being rushed to the hospital in Valparaiso he passed away two hours later. &quot;He just gave up,&quot; said his father, once he lost his shot at Akron.

Doug&#x27;s story appeared in newspapers across the US and in Canada telling of his courageous battle. Tom Brown, 13, who raced in Valparaiso the year prior, winning the class A title, and was a pallbearer at Doug&#x27;s funeral, spoke well of his best friend. When Doug was awarded another bike in this year&#x27;s race he gave it to Tom, who had his stolen the week prior. To honor Hoback the Gary Soap Box Derby created the Doug Hoback Memorial Award, inaugurated in 1957 with recipient Tommy Osburn and continuing into the seventies, awarded to competitors demonstrating courage and outstanding sportsmanship. His extant brown racer was exhibited at the 3rd Annual Vintage Derby Car Show in July 2024 in Akron, Ohio, courtesy a private collector.

==== Stephen Damon ====

Derby was an attractive activity for all kinds of kids, including Stephen Damon of Norfolk, Virginia, who raced in the Tidewater, Virginia Soap Box Derby local race in 1964 and 1965. His brother Wally, 14, raced also. Unlike most that participated, Stephen was almost completely blind, with 2 percent vision in one eye. Yet as expected with all participants he had to construct his own racer, understandably with the help of his father, Wallis Damon Sr., who would show him where to drill or cut. According to Derby rules he was also expected to drive his own car, although he could name a substitute driver to go in his place. Choosing to drive the car himself he worked out a modern solution by following instructions sent by radio to a receiver in his helmet. The words &quot;radio dispatched&quot; were painted on his class B racer. He was sponsored by the Naval Aviation Safety Center, who loaned the radio equipment. Not quite getting the hang of its use he crashed into a fence at the bottom during his first try. The following year when Stephen was 13-years-old, Navy Commander Richard E. McMahon (1924–2013), an administrator at the Norfolk Naval Air Station, stood watch as Stephen&#x27;s eyes, talking him calmly down the hill, with Stephen successfully winning his first heat. He was bested in the next heat by Gary Osman, who became overall champ that day. Stephen was enrolled at the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind.

=== Derby social life ===

==== Derby camp ====

An added inducement for kids competing in the All-American was attending Derby Camp during the week leading up to the race on the Sunday. Here kids got a chance to meet one another and make new friends, blow off some steam and relax while being engaged in games and camp activities. Located south of Akron, the YMCA facility, called Camp Y-Noah, housed the kids 8–10 per cabin, each with a trained counselor, set in groups of five or six in the hills overlooking Lake Y-Noah. Activities included horseback riding and hiking on the nature trails, swimming on the beach and dock, and baseball, basketball, tennis and volleyball at the sports facility. The recreation center offered table tennis, a hobby shop and a place to gather and socialize.

==== The Derby family ====

This period witnessed the growth of the Derby family (pictured), with fathers who were once racers themselves now putting their own sons into cars to compete. Often with mom&#x27;s help or support, even sister, an uncle or cousin throwing in, Derby became a family enterprise where two or more brothers would possibly compete against one another in their local race, or a boy would build a car for each year he competed, passing it down to a younger sibling as he outgrew it. Soap Box Derby&#x27;s &quot;boy built&quot; rule was understood—albeit frivolously—to mean that dad could help to some degree with his son&#x27;s construction of the car, which was most often the case, but the outcome meant that father and son worked together, forging a healthy and long lasting relationship that became the backbone of the Soap Box Derby. As with any sport involving family participation, there were parents wanting to win at all cost, particularly since the stakes were so high, with a kid acting simply as jockey, piloting a car that was built by an adult or hired professional. This became a growing concern and constant complaint heard around various races, with officials eventually taking measures to guard against such occurrences.

==== Winning Derby families ====

Working in a Derby family had advantages, as each member benefited from the other to improve their chances at winning races. Below are examples of members from the same family winning multiple All-American World Championships.

* The Townsend family from Anderson, Indiana, was the first to have multiple members win the All-American World Championship; Terry in 1957 and brother Barney in 1959.
* The Yarborough family from Elk Grove, California, was the first to have siblings win consecutive All-American World Championships; Curt in 1973 and brother Bret in 1974.
* The Ferdinand family from Canton, Ohio, was the first to have a sister and brother win the All-American World Championship, and the first to win across two divisions; Joan (Senior Division) in 1976 and Mark (Junior Division) in 1977.
* The Thornton family was the first to have cousins win the All-American World Championship; Bonnie (Masters Division) in 1992 and Sally (Super Stock Division) in 2006
* The Endres family took two All-American World Championships; Joel (Kit Car Division) in 1994 and Alan (Masters Division) in 1999.
* The Clemens family from Blue Springs, Missouri, was the first to win multiple All-American World Championships in the Rally program; Jamee (Rally Kit Car Division) in 1994 and Amy (Rally Masters Division) in 2002.
* The VanFossen family took two All-American World Championships in the Rally program; Ashley in 2001 and Dennis in 2007, both in the Rally Super Stock Division.

==== Ken Cline ====

A Derby family success story is that of Ken Cline, 1967 World Champion and AASBD Hall of Fame inductee in 2017. Ken came from a large family of nine kids, each having raced in the Soap Box Derby. Their father was regional manager for Northern Natural Gas and relocated often. While the family was living in Midland, Texas, brothers Richard and Michael won that local&#x27;s races in 1964 and 1965, respectively, with both going to Akron. Ken raced in Midland in 1966 and was favored to win, but a rain-soaked track hampered his car. The following year he won in Lincoln, Nebraska, when they lived there and went on the take the All-American crown a month later. Sister Rita went to Akron in 1972 having won in Amarillo, Texas.

Ken&#x27;s win in Akron happened during Derby&#x27;s peak, in a car of unprecedented design. Called &quot;the Grasshopper,&quot; a name he disliked at first since his name for it was &quot;Experimental III,&quot; it was a low profile, needle-nosed racer with a short wheelbase, the minimum allowed. It was also the first World Championship car having the front axle placed rearward, a trend that continued well into the seventies. From among the numerous awards in the technical achievement categories he received the Best Designed trophy at the All-American on top of his competitive win.

Continuing the family tradition, Ken&#x27;s daughter Alethia won the local championship as a Senior Division entry in Chicago, Illinois, in 1987, becoming the first child of a World Champion to race in Akron and advancing to the second round after beating the Akron Champ in the first. His son Houston raced also in the Junior Division. Cline became director of the Lincoln, Nebraska local race, and helped organize the Greater Chicago Soap Box Derby when he moved there in 1986. After becoming its director he served as regional director for Midwest states in 1990. Cline was part of the team that developed and designed the pre-fabricated, fiber glass shell Stock Division car introduced in 1992. It is still being used today. He is founder and director of the Annual Vintage Derby Car Show taking place each July in Akron, Ohio during Race Week. His extant car is on exhibit at the ISBD Hall of Fame Museum at Derby Downs.

== 1970s ==

In the late sixties enrollment at the Soap Box Derby was at an all-time-high, with craftsmanship and car design exploring innovative new concepts that favored drivers in a full lay-down position instead of the standard sit-up configuration. At the onset of the 1970s Derby Downs was confronted with social pressure brought on by the Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement demanding that institutions like the Soap Box Derby embrace more modern trends. In 1971 it was announced therefore that girls would be allowed to race for the first time.

=== Girls join Derby ===

In 1933 Alice Johnson (1921–1985) was one of two girls to race at the very first city-wide soap box race in Dayton, having constructed her car with the help of her father, Dayton aviator Edward &quot;Al&quot; Johnson. Taking second, she was awarded a bouquet of flowers from winner Randall Custer, and a boy&#x27;s bike. The following year she raced again in the Dayton local race, taking third.

No Derby Rule Book ever stated that girls were unable to compete officially, but it was suggested in the language of promotional material and newspaper advertisements, with Chevrolet dealerships even refusing to accept girl applicants or sell them wheels and axles. There was also resistance from many, including its founder Myron Scott, who stated that he devised the sport to be exclusively &#x27;boys only&#x27; from the start. Counter to this, popular opinion was positing a more liberal stance, with Chevrolet receiving legal pressure from local Derby organizations wishing to enter girls. This coupled with the fact that former racers that were now dads wanted to participate in Derby once more by putting their child into a car, but only had daughters. Mason Bell, general manager of the Soap Box Derby from 1964 to 1972, knew that it was only a matter of time before girls be let in.

Unlike most organized sports, the Soap Box Derby chose not to split competition along gender lines by creating a separate category for each, meaning all contestants would compete on an equal footing. At the 34th All-American, Rebecca Carol Phillips (1959–2023) of Temple, Texas, was the very first girl to take a run down the track at Derby Downs, racing the first heat in lane 1, and winning it. The following year two girls cracked the top ten in a field of 236 entries: Priscilla Freeman of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, who took 5th, and Karen Johnson of Suburban Detroit, Michigan, who came 7th. In no time the girls equaled the boys, and in 1975 the first female World Champion honor fell to Karren Stead, 11, (her car pictured) of Lower Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who not only won but did so in an arm cast she acquired a few days earlier after an injury at Derby Camp.

=== Chevrolet bows out ===

By the sixties there were concerns among Derby officials about Chevrolet&#x27;s continued sponsorship of the Soap Box Derby, filling Derby Downs with a sense of uncertainty leading up to the seventies. Till now Chevrolet was the Derby&#x27;s sole national sponsor, but questions within the General Motors management was whether it was still benefiting from its investment. Derby general manager Mason Bell was aware of these concerns and worked tirelessly to keep Chevrolet on board as long as possible. GM general manager John DeLorean stated on record that he felt the Derby was outdated and too expensive to hold, so the hard decision fell to him, and on September 28, 1972, it was announced that Chevrolet would end its sponsorship. The Akron Chamber of Commerce stepped up to ensure that the World Championship race the following year would take place, but the budget could not come close to match Chevrolet&#x27;s nearly $1 million annual budget, though Chevrolet did pledge a final $30,000 for the 1973 race. They also transferred all rights and chattels over to the new sponsor for a single settlement of $1, including the Soap Box Derby name and logo, and capital used in staging the All-American like structures, finish-line bridge, bleachers and equipment. The All-American was held successfully in 1973, but enrollment had dropped by almost half.

=== Cheating scandal ===


Following Chevrolet&#x27;s stepping down as national sponsor, Derby Downs was beset by a cheating scandal that threatened to damage its credibility as a trusted American institution. In 1973, World Champion Jimmy Gronen, 14, of Boulder, Colorado, was stripped of his title just two days after being crowned the winner after he was caught cheating. Unusual discrepancies surrounding Gronen&#x27;s margins of victory and heat times tipped off Derby officials, and an investigation of his car (pictured left) was conducted using X-ray examination, which revealed an electromagnet in the nose of the car, along with electrical wires connected it to a battery. By Gronen leaning his helmet against a switch hidden in the helmet fairing (pictured right) of the car&#x27;s body, the electromagnet became charged, effectively making the nose of the car grab the steel plate of the starting gate. When the gate swung forward, freeing the cars so they could start their run, Gronen&#x27;s car was pulled forward as well, giving it a boost. Videotape of the race showed a suspiciously sudden lead for Gronen just a few feet after each heat began. Other suspicions were Gronen&#x27;s heat times progressively slowing down as the race wore on—heat times usually get faster each time a racer completes a heat—as the battery drained power each time the circuit was closed, reducing the effectiveness of the magnet. The margin of victory for a race heat is normally no more than . Gronen&#x27;s early heat victories were in the range.

Midway through the race, Derby officials also replaced Gronen&#x27;s wheels after chemicals were found to be applied to the wheels&#x27; rubber. The chemicals caused the tire rubber to swell, which reduced the rolling resistance of the tire. In the final heat, Gronen finished narrowly ahead of Brent Yarborough, who was declared the 1973 champion two days later.

Gronen&#x27;s uncle and legal guardian at the time, wealthy engineer Robert Lange, was indicted for contributing to the delinquency of a minor and paid a $2,000 settlement.

=== Derby rebuilds ===

By the end of the year the Akron Chamber of Commerce severed ties with the Derby Downs, which now needed a new sponsor. The next month the Akron Jaycees Junior Chamber of Commerce instituted the &quot;Save the All-American Committee&quot;, which became the All-American Soap Box Derby, Inc. led by Ron D. Baker, general manager at Derby Downs from 1974 till 1977. In preparation for the 1974 season, new rules were instituted to govern against the possibility of a repeat of previous year&#x27;s cheating scandal. The gates at the starting line were rendered magnet-proof.

==== Back to basics Derby (BBD) ====

Part of Derby Downs&#x27; campaign in 1974 to address the cheating scandal was to consider introducing a back-to-basics-Derby program, or BBD, which favored simplification over &quot;runaway sophistication.&quot; Written and submitted to Derby officials by art-director and film-maker Robert Cihi and introduced in February of that year, the program was basically a pared-down version of the Official Rules Book, from twenty pages to four. An avid Derby fan and participant, with two boys having already participated in local races and one making to the All-American in 1971, Cihi criticized the rules for being much too complicated for the average competitor to understand. &quot;It&#x27;s pretty sick, deluding and insane to think an 11-year-old boy or girl could take home the official rule book and read it. No child can work as long as it takes to build a car according to the official rule book,&quot; said Cihi. He felt it catered to those privileged professional families that could invest the time and money to build a car of such sophistication. Ronald D. Baker stated &quot;Without a doubt, it&#x27;s the trend of the future, the Derby&#x27;s way of moving back to basics&quot; when speaking about Akron&#x27;s decision to introduce the Junior kits two years later.

Because of the scandal, the clandestine practice of cars being made in professional factories rather than by the kids themselves was beginning to be challenged openly. The emphasis shifted to simpler, kid-built wood construction, the cars themselves being assembled in a manner that allowed judges to uncover any device like the one found in the magnet car. Pre-race inspectors also began to randomly question a larger number of kids of their knowledge of their car&#x27;s construction to verify whether they did in fact do the work. This led to three contestants being disqualified in 1974, receiving protest from the kids&#x27; parents yet praise from others wanting to protect the integrity of the Derby. Local organizers sending a champion to the Akron also had to sign an affidavit attesting to the legal compliance of the car being shipped.

The 1974 All-American race came off as a success, though again the attendance had dropped. Curt Yarborough, 11, of Elk Grove, California, was crowned World Champion in a field of 99 entries, and claiming the first back-to-back win of siblings at the All-American, following his younger brother Brent Yarborough, who won the year prior. 

=== Novar sponsorship ===

As the 1975 season was winding down, the Soap Box Derby still had no sponsor. In late November, Barberton, Ohio, firm Novar Electronics pledged $165,000 for the All-American the following year, almost double what was spent on the previous two years combined. Novar president James H. Ott felt that losing a popular institution like the Soap Box Derby in Akron would be a tragedy, especially during America&#x27;s bi-centennial, admitting that most of the management personal, including himself, were born in Akron. The agreement with Derby Downs was to continue with the annual contribution, stipulating that it would give a three-year lead time if Novar intended to end its sponsorship, avoiding the shock of Chevrolet&#x27;s stepping down a few years prior. Novar&#x27;s annual contributions continued until 1988 when a fiscal downturn forced them to withdraw.

=== Junior Division ===

Following the girl&#x27;s entry into the sport that culminated in Karren Stead&#x27;s World Championship win in 1975, Derby Downs introduced the Junior Division the following year. Open to kids ages ten through twelve, it became an entry-level tier with an entirely new, &quot;patterned&quot; car design sold as a kit, with easy-to-follow instructions, and included everything except the wood and tools to build a complete racer. Kids ages twelve through fifteen, now identified as the Senior Division, would continue to construct cars from scratch. This now meant that the All-American would crown two champions, a Junior and Senior, making Karren Stead the last sole Champion at the All-American.

Champions for 1976 were Joan Ferdinand of Canton, Ohio, in the Senior Division and Phil Raber of New Philadelphia, Ohio, in the Junior. 1976 also had the distinction of allowing the return of windscreens, permitted on Junior cars only—Raber&#x27;s champ car had one—but this was discontinued the following year and has remained so ever since. The Junior Division races at the 40th All-American were sponsored by Keds Shoes.

== Expansion ==

The years leading into the 21st century were occupied by administrative efforts of the Soap Box Derby to maintain fiscal solvency, with Derby Downs continuing to secure a national sponsor. The most visible change at Derby Downs was further expansion of the divisions into three: Stock, Super Stock and Masters; along with the introduction of the fiber glass and plastic shell kits that are still being used today. Rally-format racing also became part of the All-American curriculum in 1993.

=== Jeff Iula ===

In 1988 assistant general manager Jeff Iula became GM, helming Derby Downs through its most fiscally challenging years before stepping down in 2009, the longest serving GM in Derby history. A self-described Derby encyclopedia, Jeff is widely regarded as the one individual that can cite Soap Box Derby history from memory. In Akron and within the Derby community he is called &quot;Mr. Derby,&quot; his car&#x27;s vanity plates being so inscribed.

During his tenure Iula oversaw sweeping changes to the Derby, beginning with sponsorship from a variety of benefactors. In 1988 Novar&#x27;s twelve-year financial campaign supporting the Derby ended, but First National Bank of Ohio quickly stepped up with support of $175,000 per year for two years, plus $25,000 for promotions. This was followed by candy maker Leaf, Inc. from 1993 to 1994. In 1998 Goodyear made contributions as a national sponsor, with NASCAR signing on in 2002 in a multi-year agreement through their Youth Program Initiative, and Home Depot in 2003. In 2005 Levi Strauss Signature began pledging the $5,000 scholarship for each All-American division winner through 2007. Iula also oversaw creation of the three Official Divisions and full implementation of the prefabricated kits, beginning with the introduction of the Stock in 1992, the Super Stock in 1994 and the Masters in 1999.

Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, Jeff was first introduced to Derby at age nine when his father Ralph Iula, working in promotions for the Akron Beacon Journal, took him to a race. &quot;He was crazy about it,&quot; said Iula.&quot; He would remember everything about everything and he grew up loving it.&quot; Because he felt that there would be a conflict of interest, the senior Iula would not allow his son to race. Even though he never built a car nor ran in a local event, he was permitted to substitute for the 1966 Okinawa Champion Raymond J. Rapoza, who was unable to attend due to an airline strike, though his car did arrive in Akron, which Jeff got to drive. Having not won his one and only heat, &quot;it did not dampen his enthusiasm,&quot; said his father. By the early-seventies he began volunteering in a variety of roles, like working tirelessly on maintenance of the grandstands to recruiting volunteers to help out. In 1976 he was hired on as administrative assistant after being an employee at the Beacon Journal. In the announcement he was already being referred to as &quot;Derby historian.&quot;

As Derby spokesperson and expert commentator, Iula has been interviewed on A&amp;E, CBS, ESPN, Fox News, HBO, PBS, The Today Show and Wide World of Sports. He has also been quoted in the Akron Beacon Journal, The Boston Globe, Car &amp; Driver, the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News and The New York Times, Sports Illustrated and USA Today. In 2006 Iula was inducted into the Soap Box Derby Hall of Fame. With co-author Bill Ignizio he penned &quot;How I Saw It: My Photographic Memory of the Soap Box Derby&quot; in 2011. Following his stepping down as general manager he became councilman-at-large for the City of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, where he currently resides.

=== Stock and Kit Car Divisions ===

To expand enrollment further, Derby introduced a third category in 1992, called the Stock Division, which now became the entry-level tier with the introduction of the new pre-fabricated, fiber glass kit car. Kids continuing to hand-build the wooden kits raced in a new mid-level tier, called the Kit Car Division. This meant that there would be three champions at the All-American instead of two, each representing their division. The Masters racer remained the only non-kit car that racers had to fabricate from scratch until 1999, when a prefabricated Masters kit, called the &quot;Scottie&quot; was made available for sale.

Since 1976, the top-tier Senior/Master Division cars were fully-reclined lay-down designs, while the Junior/Stock and Kit Car Division entries remained sit-ups. From 1992 to 1998 many Masters cars returned to the sit-up configuration, with James Marsh winning the 1998 Masters Division World Championship in a sit-up design. In 1999 a fully prefabricated kit for the Masters Division, dubbed the &quot;Scottie&quot; after Derby creator Myron Scott, debuted, ending the sit-up era for top-tier racers.

=== Rally racing ===

==== National Derby Rallies ====

Rally racing began in the mid-seventies when doubts about Derby Downs&#x27; redrafting of its rules for 1974, meant to discourage cheating, drew criticism for being too complex for kids to grasp. This resulted in organizations outside its jurisdiction planning competitions of their own. Operating independently from the Soap Box Derby, National Derby Rallies—or NDR, was established in 1977, conducting races nationwide across ten districts, with five being held in each over the course of the year. This appealed to families who wanted to see their kids get more than a single use out of a racer that took time and money to build. Created as a &quot;grand-prix style&quot; program, kids got to travel to other communities outside their own, providing greater opportunity to develop their racing skills in preparation for their local Soap Box Derby. The program was based on a points accrual system, with the top six contestants in each district going to the National Derby Rally Championship race. Befitting the rally format, the location of the Nationals was hosted by a different host city each year. In 1978 it was held in Warren, Ohio, in 1979 and 1980 Chattanooga, Tennessee, and in 1981 Allentown, Pennsylvania.

NDR continues to conduct its own program, running concurrently with the Soap Box Derby race season, with contestants and their families participating actively in both. Operating across five divisions, they are Stock, Super Stock and Masters, which employ the official Derby kits, and NDR Masters and Legacy, which allow non-kit, hand-built construction with no age cap for the driver. NDR is based in Hermitage, Pennsylvania. The Nationals will be hosted in 2024 and 2025 by South Charleston Soap Box Derby and the City of South Charleston, West Virginia.

==== Soap Box Derby Rally Race Program ====

In 1986 Derby Downs officially adopted a Rally format of its own by introducing its Rally Division, followed in 1993 by the first All-American Rally World Championship. With the Rally Division added to the All-American, Akron now crowned six Champions each year. Today it functions across 12 regions, plus one for international competitors, accepting entries in all three Official Derby Divisions. Like the NDR the program is based on a points accrual system.

=== FirstEnergy sponsorship ===

In 2012 FirstEnergy signed on as title sponsor, with its name being added to the All-American, now officially the FirstEnergy All-American Soap Box Derby. Without a large sponsor since 2007 and in the red the year prior, Derby president and CEO Joe Mazur estimated that Derby Downs will be in the black this year, but just barely. Though he could not disclose the amount of the contribution at the time, he did state that FirstEnergy had made a three-year commitment. On July 19, 2024, FirstEnergy announced officially that it would extend its title sponsorship three more years through to 2027.

==== Strategic plan ====

During those first three years, Mazur set about writing and implementing a strategic plan, shifting Derby&#x27;s mandate from youth orientation to education programs and greater adult participation, including having them race. The plan also opened up use of the track facility in more creative ways involving community outreach, with events like autism day, senior citizens day, and grandparents day as well as renting the track out to community interest groups and various corporate benefits. With the plan being put into effect along with continued sponsorship from FirstEnergy, Derby Downs was able to make good on its debts, ending 2014 with a healthy surplus.

In 2019 FirstEnergy reaffirmed its commitment to sponsoring the Derby for another five years. They also provided six billboards in the area to promote the All-American, and were also a source of numerous volunteers, said Derby president Mark Gerberich during the announcement. The sponsorship amounted to over $1 million through 2023 and the 85th running of the All-American. In February 2023 it was announced that Akron-based Myers Industries, a manufacturer of the Super Stock kits and shells, became a major sponsor and entered a partnership with the ISBD that allows Derby Downs to discount the price of Super Stock car kits and Super Stock car shells for the next 3-years.

== International Soap Box Derby ==

In 1936 the Soap Box Derby became an international affair when cars from outside the US participated at the All-American National race in Akron, with a competitor from South Africa in 1936 and another from Canada in 1937. Three cars from abroad entered in 1938: Canada, Hawaii (not yet a US State) and Panama, although Hawaii was permitted to participate as an American entry. Other participants since then have included Australia, Germany, Guam, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Panama, the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Venezuela. Switzerland has also conducted their own races since 1970 in Ticino and German-speaking Switzerland. No champion representing that country has raced at the All-American.

=== Canada ===

Canada was one of the earliest entries into organizing its own local races outside the US, chief among them the Kinsmen Coaster Classic, which debuted in Montreal, Quebec, in 1938. Two of Canada&#x27;s most prominent entries were Mission City (now Mission, British Columbia), and St. Catharines, Ontario, both of whom were affiliated with the Soap Box Derby as official franchises and were qualified to send champs to the All-American in Akron. Mission acquired the rights to the Western Canada Soapbox Derby Championships in 1946 and the Mission Regional Chamber of Commerce, previously named the Mission City &amp; District Board of Trade, organized the event annually until 1973. It resumed again in 1999. St. Catharines ran races from 1947 until 1972. In Eastern Canada, communities that held races included Aylmer, Quebec, Beauharnois, Quebec, Laval, Quebec, Nepean, Ontario, Peterborough, Ontario, Sainte-Genevieve, Quebec, Stratford, Ontario, Trois-Rivières, Quebec, and Gatineau, Quebec, which played host to the Canadian National Soap Box Derby Championship each year. None of these qualified to send their champs to compete in Akron.

From among Canada&#x27;s many attempts at capturing an All-American World Championship in Akron, St. Catharines fared the best at Derby Downs, with Terri Martinson taking second place at the 59th All-American in 1996. Andy Vasko of St.Catharines took third place at the 20th All-American in 1957. In the non-competitive category honoring technical achievements, St. Catharines&#x27; Ken Thomas took home the Best Construction Award at the 30th All-American in 1967.

Today Canada remains active in various communities across the nation, with five participating at International Soap Box Derby-sanctioned races. These include Drummond, New Brunswick, Lincoln, Ontario, Saint John, New Brunswick, Smiths Falls, Ontario, and Tyne Valley, Prince Edward Island. The Swift Current Soapbox Racing Association in Swift Current, Saskatchewan has hosted races since 1983, making it the longest continuous Soap Box Derby race in Canada. Each year around fifty junior and senior cars are loaned out to kids that sigh up. 2024 will mark its 41st race.

=== Germany ===

Germany, the most active member of the international Derby community, began races in 1949 in what was then the US-occupation zone of Germany and Berlin. Called the Deutschen Seifenkisten Derby or DSKD, its national sponsor was Adam Opel Automobile Works, which took over from US Armed Forces in 1951, and supplied the official wheels used on the cars. Over the next ten years this led to 214 communities sending local champs to the German Nationals, its overall champion representing Germany at the All-American in Akron.

==== German Derby classes ====

DSKD remains active today, conducted across four classes. The first three follow strict rules; the last is more relaxed.

* Junior (ages 7–12) was introduced in 1984 and is the most uniform racer design, similar to the Junior Division kit racer introduced in 1976 in the US. Total weight allowance is 90 kg.
* Senior (ages 11–21) was created when the Junior was introduced. It has no restriction on body design, but over time has found favor with the lay-down configuration, similar to the Senior and Masters Division cars in the US. Weight allowance is 113 kg.
* Elite XL (age 13 and up) was introduced in 2006 and has similar body design to the Senior but for larger drivers. Weight allowance is 150 kg.
* DSKD-Open (age 7 and up) was introduced in 2014 for anyone wanting to get creative when constructing racer, in the tradition of the Soap Box hand-built racer of Derby&#x27;s early days. Weight allowance is 160 kg.

== Rules ==

One of Derby&#x27;s first rules was that the car had to be &quot;boy-built,&quot; without the assistance of an adult. This was seldom the case as most boys did require some help simply because they lacked the skills to perform such a feat, acquiring them eventually as the car was constructed while working with an adult. In the early days a boy was allowed assistance from a friend or other individual under the age of sixteen. To guarantee that boys strictly obeyed the rule, pre-race inspection of the car would have judges randomly ask that he demonstrate his knowledge of its construction if there was doubt about who actually built it. The rules also stipulated that the car must be driven by the boy that built it, though in the event that he came down with an illness or injury and was therefore unable to race, he was permitted to name a substitute driver to go in his place.

Race contestants at the local level were divided into two classes based on age: 9–12 raced as class B, 13–15 as class A. Each class declared a winner, who then raced each other in the final. That winner would be declared the overall Champion and become eligible to compete at the All-American in Akron as a representative of their home town. The class distinctions was replaced eventually by the three official divisions.

=== Construction ===

Derby regulations regarding the construction of racers played an integral role in their design, since cars had to comply with size and weight restrictions. Excluding wheels, axles and assembly hardware, all cars were to be made of wood only. The maximum weight allowance was for both car and driver (verified during a weigh-in prior to the race), the overall length no more than , a wheelbase no less than , height not to exceed and a wheel tread of between and . The front axle was to be mounted on a single kingpin, and directional control governed by steel cables, a single steering column and wheel. No ropes were allowed. The brake was to be a friction or drag type, usually an armature through the floor that was activated by a foot pedal. Wheels were to be the solid rubber type, not pneumatic, and measure no more than in diameter, a limit that began in 1937. Finally the driver was to be seated upright, though the practice was to crouch forward to minimize wind resistance. Pre-race inspections verified that the car was well constructed according to strict observance of the rules, and safe to drive.

=== Clinics ===

The late thirties saw the emergence of Derby &quot;clinics&quot; being held in communities across the US and Canada, organized through various social institutions like the YMCA or at community centers or school gymnasiums. Attended by kids and their parents, the clinics were set up as informal gatherings meant to educate participants of the particulars of constructing and piloting a racer, sometimes offering practice time for the kids on an actual track. Here questions were asked and information was exchanged so that entrants would understand the regulations well enough to pass inspection on race day. Organizers would often have past Derby champs attend to offer their own words of advice, or indeed have their car, or multiple cars, there as well to demonstrate how a winner was built. It was often at these clinics that friendships between kids and families would begin, since they were by and large casual assemblages meant to introduce Soap Box Derby to, as well as attract, local youth.

Official Clinic Guides were published through the AASBD to help organizers run standardized clinics, which were done routinely over several weeks, usually on a Sunday, in preparation for the big race, and in many communities were held annually for decades. Rochester, New York held its 25th annual clinic in 1962, the same year that Derby celebrated its own 25th Anniversary.

=== Restrictions ===

As governance increased and each year&#x27;s Soap Box Derby Official Rules Book was updated, restrictions were implemented to maintain safety. Windscreens were popular design features used since 1934 that helped improve streamlining and thus overall speed, so to limit that they were banned in 1948. They were permitted again in 1976 when they could be fitted on the new Junior-Division racers, but were dropped a year later. Between 2004 and 2014 they re-emerged at Ultimate Speed Challenge races, but have since been banned outright, no longer being permitted at any sanctioned Soap Box Derby race. In 1953 use of vertical-mounted steering columns was cut from the Official Rules Book, allowing horizontal columns only, though today&#x27;s modern kits all run with standardized, pre-fabricated vertical steering columns. In 1965 lead and steel were permitted in the construction of the car, which was an asset in being able to add weight.

== Race format ==

At Derby&#x27;s inaugural race in 1934 as many as five cars raced at once in a single heat, but this ended for safety reasons with the introduction of lanes. For decades cars raced in two or three lanes in single elimination heats, meaning once a racer lost, they were out of the contest. As early as the late fifties the double elimination format began being used. With Derby Downs&#x27; mandate to further level the competitive playing field following the &#x27;73 scandal, the double-elimination format was instituted at the Beacon Journal local Akron race in 1974. Eventually the &#x27;double-elimination, timer swap&#x27; was introduced. In it two competitors would exchange their wheels with each other, trade lanes and race again. Most Derby participants knew which lane was the better, and in the past a coin toss would often determine which kid got which, which meant that fate and not competitiveness would determine an outcome, a contentious issue for some parents. The upside of such a lengthy format was that every kid got at least two shots at competing, getting more use out of a car that took months to build. An example is 1982 Akron Senior Champion John Esque, who lost his first heat, only to defeat every contender after that and came out on top in the final.

It was also made policy that no one car should have an advantage of better wheels over another, so swaps become mandatory. The downside of the new format was that this added still more heats to the elimination process. John Knox, 1956 Akron, OH Champion and a second-of-third-generation Derby family member stated in 1983 &quot;It may be dull as dishwater for the spectators,&quot; due to the slower pace of determining a winner, but fairer &quot;for the kids.&quot; Lane and wheel swaps are standard practice today.

== Car design ==

Design and construction of a Soap Box Derby car usually reflected the skills of the kid that built it, and as time passed each iteration with each new generation benefited from the previous on how a car would look. Before the introduction of kit cars in 1976, all cars were one-of-a kind creations, some looking particularly unique in their experimentation with form and function. Like any evolutionary process (pictured), if innovations were successful at the track they were passed on.

=== Sit-up cars ===

The majority of Soap Box Derby racers were—and remain—cars piloted by occupants in the sit-up position, and before 1964 was the only method allowed by the rules. Having not yet acquired the skills, boys usually learned as they went, building simple-to-construct, boxy designs—plywood or metal skin, even fabric, over a bulkhead/floorboard framework. As cars became less boxy and more curvaceous, other techniques were used to smooth out the body lines such as papier-mâché and chicken wire, which were among the many options suggested in the Official Rules Book. Construction of this type produced cars that performed well at races including the All-American, with some taking World Champion.

Examples of basic sit-ups that won in Akron are Darwin Cooper of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, who took the All-American in 1951, and Harold &quot;Bo&quot; Conrad from Duluth, Minnesota, who did the same in 1963.

==== Laminate cars ====

Boys learned to build more sophisticated racers that took aerodynamics into consideration, with the result being more streamlined designs. To achieve this the more skillful entries were made from laminate construction, sandwiching multiple layers of lumber laid horizontally or vertically and held together with fasteners or glue. The intent was to create a sturdy hollow shell in the shape a car, the hollow cavity meant to accommodate the driver and various control mechanisms like the brake and steering. Once the glue had cured the outside of the shell had to be hewn into a more precise aerodynamic shape, using a hand plane or saw, then sanded smooth until the final form was achieved. With floorboards as thick as four inches, these cars ended up being considerably heavy, which was a useful advantage when smaller drivers needed the additional weight. Though time-consuming it was a technique used successfully by skilled builders, but &quot;next to impossible,&quot; as stated by Myron Scott in 1950, for most boys. Derby Downs felt that its use placed an unfair advantage over other kids building the more common, boxy designs, so in 1950 banned its use. The following year the rule was rescinded, and laminates continued being built as late as 1970.

Examples of laminate construction are found in cars piloted by Thomas Fisher of Detroit, Michigan, who won the All-American in 1940, Garland Ross Jr. (pictured) of Muncie, Indiana, who raced as a class B entry from 1949 to 1951, Donald Klepsch of Detroit, Michigan who won his local in 1949, and William Smith who took the Mobile, Alabama, championship in 1964.

==== Sight grooves and other sixties innovations ====

Peculiar innovations appearing from the late-fifties to the late-sixties were cars fitted with clefts (pictured) or depressions running axially along the fore-deck, called &quot;sight-grooves&quot;, through which drivers could see ahead while slumped low in the cockpit. Other innovations saw the front axles being placed further aft in an attempt to place as much weight of the car rearward, meaning as high up the hill from the finish line, to gain even a hundredth of a second advantage. 1967 World Champion Ken Cline&#x27;s low-profile racer, called &quot;the Grasshopper&quot;, was the first World Champion with a car configured in this way. Andy Killian, a competitor from Hickory, North Carolina talked about experimenting with buckshot hidden in a cavity of his floorboard, an idea from &quot;backyard engineer&quot; Bill Cockerham, whose son Mark won the Hickory local in 1968. The theory was that as the car ran down the hill, the loose shot would roll forward first, which would end up pushing the car. The results were inconclusive.

Cockpit tonneau covers were also being added to enclose a larger boy&#x27;s back and shoulders, which usually protruded slightly outside the car body, in an attempt to improve aerodynamics. With boys that raced for more than one year and began to outgrow their cars, side blisters would sometimes be fitted to accommodate shoulders or elbows that were becoming restricted.

==== Shotgun steering ====

An unusual innovation came in 1965 with &quot;shotgun steering&quot;, a design solution in response to a regulation stipulating that the steering column be situated above the floor of the car. Many cars by then were being built lower than that, so the column had to be placed above and outside the car body, which ended up looking like a machine gun on a WWI fighter, and thus its name. Examples of cars fitted with this type of steering were 1965 Lynchburg, Virginia Champion John McDaniels III, 1970 World Champion Sam Gupton of Durham, North Carolina, and 1971 World Champion Larry Blair of Oroville, California. Shotgun steering was banned in 1972.

=== Lay-down cars ===

In 1964 the first lay-back or lay-down designs were appearing on the track, this to improve performance by minimizing aerodynamic drag. By the early seventies they had become status-quo for the most competitive cars, with 1969 being the first year that a lay-down design won the World Championship, piloted by Steve Souter of Midland, Texas.

An example of a lay-down car (pictured) is that of Amanda Baker, who won the Akron (Metro), Ohio Masters Championship in 1991.

==== Stick cars ====

With the lay-downs came composite materials being incorporated into their construction, quite similar to wooden strip-built canoes laminated with fiberglass, called &quot;stick car&quot; construction. Though a challenge to undertake because of the complex curvature of the body shell, which usually comprised a rounded bottom and headrest fairing, this technique became quite popular with experienced build-teams wanting to create small aerodynamic body shells that snugly enclosed the driver. Beginning in the seventies it was used almost exclusively to build the Senior and later Masters Division racers, and is still being used today to construct Legacy Division entries at the All-American, praised for its emphasis on individuality, innovation and creativity.

Examples of stick-cars are found in those piloted by Craig Kitchen from Akron, Ohio who was crowned World Champion in 1979, and 1976 Green Bay, Wisconsin Sr. Champion J. C. (John) Rather (pictured), who won the Best Constructed Award at the 39th All-American.

==== Masters sit-ups ====

From 1992 to 1998 many Masters Division competitors were dominating on the track with cars build in the traditional sit-up configuration, which up to this point saw only lay-down cars as Masters entries. Prior to this the last sit-up that won the All-American was Branch Lew in 1968. Bonnie Thornton of Las Vegas, Nevada, was the first Masters World Champion in a sit-up car in 1992, and James Marsh of Cleveland, Ohio, was the last in 1998 and last to ever win in a sit-up as of 2023. Danielle DelFarraro of Akron, Ohio, who took the Masters World Championship in 1994 in a sit-up car, was the first back-to-back winner at the All-American after her 1993 world title in the Kit Division.

== Kit cars ==

=== Wood kits ===

Kits debuted with the introduction of Junior Division in 1976 when Novar Electronics became the new sponsor. Purchased from the AASBD, they came with instructions and hardware only, with the builder supplying their own construction material, which was wood. This gave kids an easier way to construct a car, a &quot;back-to-basics&quot; initiative that held firm to Derby Down&#x27;s &quot;kid-built&quot; rule while benefiting financially from their sale. They retailed for $36.95. Measurement remained roughly the same, with an overall length of . Unlike previous racers, the axles were kept exposed—without aerodynamic airfoils—and came with stabilizer braces or radius rods for the rear axle. The kit instructions offered several body designs from which to choose, but the general configuration was a flat-top car with a teardrop-shaped floor board, to which were affixed squared wooden bulkheads enclosed in a plywood skin. A standardized steering wheel was included in the kit. Windscreens were also permitted in 1976 on the kits only, but were discontinued the following year.

Examples of wood kits are racers piloted by Suzanne Miller (pictured) who won the Flint, Michigan Fall Junior Rally Championship in 1976, and Phil Raber who was the first Junior World Champion in a kit car the same year.

=== Fiberglass and plastic shell kits ===

The introduction of the fiber glass and plastic shell kits served two purposes: making construction of a car less of a hindrance for kids that till now had to construct one from scratch, and provide the All-American with a more sizable cash-flow from their sales. Kits purchased from Derby Downs after 1992 comprised a body shell (one- or two-piece) composed of ABS, a common thermoplastic polymer, for the Stock, and LLDPE, a flexible plastic, for the Super Stock. Included also was a finished floorboard that came pre-cut, painted and drilled, complete hardware including the brake and steering assembly, cables, pulleys and fasteners, and detailed assembly instructions. Wheels and axles were purchased separately.

==== Junior and Stock ====

In 1981 the first fiber glass &quot;shell&quot; kits debuted at the All-American, which were complete pre-fabricated car bodies made from two-halves that would shave 10 to 15 hours off building a wooden car, though many contestants continued to use wood. As enrollment in the Derby continued to dwindle due to the complexity of building a racer, Ken Cline and 1971 Bay City, Michigan Champion Mark Packard, founders of the Greater Chicago Soap Box Derby, got to work with a team on creating an easy-to-build, one-piece shell kit that simplified the building process for kids lacking a workshop. Packard worked on the design while Cline built prototypes that would be presented to the All-American. According to them it could be assembled by a kid in an apartment in as little as four hours with few tools. The design was accepted, and in 1992 debuted as the official Stock Division racer, replacing the Junior, and made mandatory. The move, which &quot;saved the Derby,&quot; according to officials, attracted new kids and contributed to Derby Downs&#x27; coffers. For their contribution, Cline and Packard were inducted into the AASBD Hall of Fame in 2017.

==== Super Stock ====

1994 saw the debut of the Super Stock Division, with a two-piece shell comprising a top and bottom section of a brand new design replacing the previous Kit Car Division. Mounted atop a flat floorboard, the completely curvilinear, teardrop-shaped shell was made wider and had a larger cockpit opening to accommodate the bigger kids. It comprised a rounded nose, tapered tail, and featured a sight groove on the fore deck, the only design of the shell kits to be so equipped. Like the Stock kit, it could be assembled in as little as four hours. Replacing the Kit Car with the Super Stock meant that the only scratch-built entry remaining in 1994 was the Masters.

==== Masters ====

The final kit intended for the Masters Division, the &quot;Scottie Special,&quot; debuted in 1999 as a full lay-down design with flat bottom and headrest fairing, and required eight to twelves hours to assemble. Announced in 1998 by Derby general manager Jeff Iula, it was named in honor of founder Myron Scott, who was among the first group of inductees at the AASBD Hall Of Fame in 1997. Scott passed away the following year.

== Running gear ==

Soap Box Derby cars comprised two main components, the car body itself, usually made entirely from wood and sometimes sheet metal or other flexible material, later fiber glass, and the (wheels, axles and suspension) comprising pre-fabricated metal components from a wide variety of sources. In 1937 rules began establishing what could and could not be used.

=== Suspension ===

By the late 1930s most cars had axles running through the car body rather than underneath, bolted to the topside of the floorboard. Flexibility of the axle bar helped dampen vibrations from the effects of imperfections on the track&#x27;s surface like cracks, and counter undulations of the pavement. Wooden fitted over the axles were also permitted to act as aerodynamic airfoils that streamlined the car as well as spread the car&#x27;s weight evenly over the axle&#x27;s length. A variation on this was the &quot;Akron Four-Point Suspension&quot;, where the axletrees would concentrate the car&#x27;s weight at the end of the axles, alleviating their tendency to bow in the middle while under load. Axles could also be pre-bowed or arced to counter this, with the ends bent downward slightly, making the wheels camber outward at the top (positive camber). When the driver&#x27;s weight was added the arc would flatten, straightening the wheels so they would sit perpendicular to the ground.

More complex suspension designs that were suggested in the Official Rules Book were the &#x27;rubber-ball suspension,&#x27; using a ball mounted atop the front axle as a spring cushion, and the &#x27;springboard suspension,&#x27; where a diving-board-type device fitted in much the same way yielded similar results. 1969 Sheboygan, Wisconsin Champion Michael Benishek, 15, used a coil-type suspension of his own design on both axles, and was awarded Best-Innovation in the technical category along with his competitive win. A unique suspension was found on 1979 Hamilton, OH Senior Champion Stuart Paul&#x27;s car (pictured), winning the Best Design Award when he competed at the 42nd All-American. His suspension comprised torsion bars fitted transversely through the car body, with trailing arms connected to a free-floating real axle that ran underneath. That year the rules stipulated that axles remain exposed on the Senior Division cars like they were on the Juniors. In response, builders installed taught wires between the nose of the car and the front wheels, called &quot;kite steering&quot; (pictured) to improve aerodynamics that were lost when airfoils over the axles were disallowed.

==== Solid, tight or loose ====

To this day the tightness settings of the fasteners between the axles and floorboard continue to be experimented with in various combinations to achieve maximum performance of the car. These include tightening the fasteners so they allow no movement whatsoever (called &#x27;solid&#x27;), a slight amount of play (&#x27;tight&#x27;) or free movement (&#x27;loose&#x27;).

=== Wheels ===

The first years of the Derby saw any sort of wheel that a boy could get his hands on to complete, since rules did not stipulate restrictions before 1937. These included scrap wheels sourced from automobiles, baby carriages, bicycles, roller skates and wagons, arranged in a tricycle or quad-configuration. Randy Custer won the Dayton city-wide race in 1933 on three wheels.

==== Pneumatic steel wheel (1936) ====

In 1936 wheels, bearing and axles were the first components of the car to become standardized with the introduction of the Goodrich Silvertown steel wheel. Purchased as a set of four, the two-part bolted wheels came with ball-type bearings and dustcaps and were fitted with a pneumatic tire measuring x . Though they were not required on the car to compete—as many boys still used scrap wheels, they were used successfully by Herbert Muench of St. Louis, Missouri, who won the 1936 World Championship.

==== Riveted steel wheels (1937–1941) ====

In 1937 the official rule book stipulated a limit on wheel size of no more than —a standard still used to this day—and a requirement that the tire be solid, not pneumatic. In compliance Goodrich Silvertown introduced Derby&#x27;s first official-issue wheel, made available for sale to within the $4–$6.00 budget set by Derby officials. Like the previous year they comprised two steel halves—this time riveted together, soon to be replaced by welds—and came in a kit that included axles measuring . Wheel-sets were often in short supply in the early years, and many suppliers took advantage of this by advertising after-market &quot;Derby-type&quot; wheels for sale in newspapers at a cheaper price, or to fill the gap when official issue were unavailable.

==== Opel wheel (1950–1971) ====

Races in Germany, called the Deutschen Seifenkisten Derby or DSKD, were sponsored by Adam Opel AG, who provided the wheels for German kids, and were only used there. The robust Opel steel wheel (pictured right) measured a slightly larger 30.5 centimetres and was used from 1950 to 1971. This was replaced by the lighter Swiss wheel, which measured 29 centimeters. In 1984 the DSKD metal wheel was introduced by the German Soapbox Derby e.V., manufactured by Mefro Wheels. German champs that raced at the All-American had their wheels replaced with those used in the US.

==== Official Soap Box Derby Tire red steel wheel (1951–1981) ====

In 1946 a new wheel, the Firestone Champion, was introduced that measured the same diameter and was painted yellow with green dust cap. A decal with the official Derby logo appeared on the obverse side of the wheel. The following year it was painted gold, again with the decal affixed, but the dust cap was dropped. In 1948 the popular red wheel was introduced, and by 1950 the rules stated that all cars had to use them, with nothing prior to 1948 being allowed. In 1951 it was re-branded the &quot;Official Soap Box Derby Tire&quot;, this time with no decal, and became the official issue at all Derby events until 1981.

==== Z-glas plastic wheel (1982–2022) ====

In 1981 a new plastic wheel was introduced, the white Z-Glas, developed by the AASBD technical organization and Derby&#x27;s national sponsor Novar Electronic Corporation. Made of high-density linear polyethylene with a polyurethane tire, it was discovered to have structural problems, with reports of failure on the track, and was felt at the time that the issue was with the design and not the plastic. Later research kept the design but tested twenty different types of plastics, settling on DuPont Zytel, made of 43% fiber glass filled nylon and, according to Novar&#x27;s James Ott, the &quot;strongest plastic made.&quot; The tire was also of a higher-traction urethane compound. It required assembly of the two hubs, then addition of the tread.

Replacing the steel wheel was done to offset its high cost, which was priced at $80.00 a set, while the new plastic issue would be $44.00. Because the wheel hubs were cast rather than pressed steel plate they were discovered to be more uniform, making wheel calibration of a set much less time-consuming due to their limited variation. After the wheel was deemed safe it was released for sale for the 1992 race season, and used successfully for forty-one years.

In Germany the Z-Glas was introduced in the 1990s as the DSKD plastic wheel.

==== UniGrip one-piece wheel (2023– ) ====

In 2023 the Z-glas was replaced by the new UniGrip, a black plastic, all-in-one-piece molded wheel and tire measuring the standard . The hubs of the new wheel are made of fiber-reinforced Nylon resin, similar to the wheel it replaced. The tread is made of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). &quot;Molding of the one-piece hub-and-tread wheel eliminates the possibilities of variations by manual assembly during the production process, thereby increasing the consistency and stability of the end product,&quot; said Bret Treier, board chairman of International Soap Box Derby. The wheel debuted at the 83rd All-American in July 2023, and are priced at $225.00 for a set.

=== Wheel performance ===

It was quickly understood that the way to victory relied largely on the wheels, and several clever means, some legal, some not, were used to exploit this. Wheel and axle sets came new out of the box when purchased, so competitors had to implement various methods of breaking in the bearings, either by hand or mechanically, over a long period until optimal spinning performance was achieved. A variety of lubricants was also experimented with, along with a common practice prior to 1954 of drilling small holes in the metal fascia to balance a wheel. According to Jeff Iula, 1953 World Champion Fred Mohler &quot;rolled down the hill on wheels drilled out and looked like Swiss cheese.&quot; Other more interesting ways of attempting to improve performance involved the rubbing of dry ice on the rubber tire to harden it, with the expectation that this would reduce rolling resistance. 1954 World Champion Dick Kemp learned during multiple test runs that as the day warmed up and with it the wheels, times improved. At the 17th All-American when most competitors used dry ice, he was heating his wheels by reflecting sunlight onto them. According to David Fulton, author of &quot;Winning Ingredients for Soap Box Derby Racers&quot;, the recommend practice on race day is to keep the car parked in the sun and over dark pavement so that the radiant heat will warm the wheels and rubber on them, improving times. A warmer car is also more flexible, which also improves performance.

=== Commemorative wheels ===

In 1958 Derby Downs began issuing commemorative Championship wheels (pictured) at the All-American, meaning every car had their original wheels replaced with the brand new set, to &quot;eliminate any type of hedging.&quot; This practice continued until 1972, with each year&#x27;s wheel having a unique color—gold (1958), silver (1959), robin-egg (1960), blue (1961), silver (1962–25th anniversary) and gold (1962–1972)—with matching water-slide decals on the obverse and reverse side, each year bearing a unique commemorative design. When Chevrolet dropped its sponsorship in 1972, the wheel, which now came in a calibrated set, continued to be painted gold but no longer had the decal. In 1982 the decals returned, this time on the obverse side only of the new Z-glas wheel, and again with a design unique to a particular year, but ended in 2002. 1998 was the first time that Derby Downs allowed a sponsor, in this case KeyBank, to feature their corporate logo on the commemorative wheel decals, which was done for five years. Goodyear&#x27;s sponsorship beginning in 1998 had its logo on a signature Z-Glas wheel in black plastic. Further commemorative wheels were issued at the 70th All-American (2007), with title sponsor Levi Strauss Signature on the decal, and the 75th (2012), showing the logo for title sponsor FirstEnergy.

=== Calibrated wheels and wheel banks ===

In 1973, Derby Downs instituted wheel matching or calibrating as part of their new policy. In the early years contestants owned their own set or sets of wheels, which they could work on to maximize performance, sometimes bending the rules to gain an advantage. After the 1973 cheating scandal the idea of eliminating such an advantage become mandated with the introduction of wheel matching and calibrating. This was carried out on a wheel tester designed by Robert Cooper of All-American Derby Control Board and Jack Morran, chairman of the National Derby&#x27;s Inspection Committee. In 1974, 576 wheels were tested over four days, with the data being collected sent to Charlotte, North Carolina where it was tallied on a computer. Results were sent back to Akron, where race officials divided the wheels into 144 sets that were as perfectly matched as possible. Each wheel was identified with markings showing set number and direction of rotation, and kept in a &quot;wheel bank,&quot; from which racers would draw lots to determine which set they would receive on the morning of race day. After the race the wheels were returned to the &quot;bank&quot; to be used the following year. Wheel banks were being set up as early as 1971 as a means of making wheels available to kids who were unsponsored and did not have funds to purchase new wheels. To ensure they were evenly matched, a wheel tester, which simulated real road conditions on a small scale, was created. The general opinion was that having every kid receive wheels that were as evenly matched with every other kids&#x27; would put &quot;the fate of the race in the driver&#x27;s hands,&quot; eliminating the wheel as a deciding factor on race outcome. While wheel banks continue being use today, management of them from among the numerous local organizers can vary, and depending on their upkeep and calibrating methods could still mean a racer might, though luck, receive a bad set.

=== Wheel swaps ===

To further eliminate advantages of any one driver blessed with a good set of wheels over one stuck with a bad one, the practice of wheel swapping was introduced. Wheel swaps involve two competitors each selecting two wheels from their opponents car and having them put on their own, called a two-wheel &quot;swap-off,&quot; then racing again. There was also a four-wheel swap-off or various combinations of two- and four-wheel swaps. Lane swapping was also implemented, again eliminating any advantages through luck. The practice of wheel swapping continues to this day in concert with lane swapping in double-elimination races. and is deemed most fair among racing families, though the initiative has received criticism for making races take too long.

== Modern Derby ==

The establishment of the pre-fabricated kit cars in 2000 as standard issue ushered in the modern era for the Soap Box Derby. Derby Downs also received a face lift in 2000 with the construction of its new $250,000 finish-line bridge (pictured). The original steel bridge, constructed in 1938, was used for 61 years. Since then the kit cars have remained visually the same, with the exception of minor upgrades to hardware that governs the safe control of the vehicle, and the introduction of the new UniGrip one-piece wheel in 2023. Cars participating in Legacy Division races are the only one-of-a-kind entries, each one being scratch-built, with the wheels being the only shared component with kit racers.

=== Race Week ===

Taking place the third week in July, Race Week comprises a full six days of social pre-race and competitive race events that culminate in the All-American World Championship on the Saturday. A traditional Derby practice on the Thursday evening is the Topside Show, an open house where participating cars are put on display for the general public to visit and view, located Topside. Competitive events that comprise Race Week include the following:

* AAA Local Challenge, sponsored by the American Automobile Association
* Akron Local, which declares the champion from Akron to be sent to the All-American
* AUI Rally Challenge, sponsored by Associated Underwriters Insurance
* Rally World Championship, which pits Regional Champions from the US and abroad for the world title
* All-Star Race
* Legacy Division, an unrestricted event for older racers
* National Super Kids Classic, for participating racers with physical challenges, inaugurated in 1975
* All-American World Championship on the Saturday, ending the week.

Participating cities around the world use advanced timing systems that measure the time difference between the competing cars to the thousandth of a second to determine the winner of a heat. Each heat of a race lasts less than 30 seconds. Most races are double elimination races in which a racer that loses a heat can work their way through the Challenger&#x27;s Bracket in an attempt to win the overall race. The annual World Championship race in Akron, however, is a single elimination race which uses overhead photography, triggered by a timing system, to determine the winner of each heat. Approximately 500 racers compete in two or three heats to determine a World Champion in each divisions.

There are three racing divisions in most locals and at the All-American competition. The Stock division is designed to give the first-time builder a learning experience. Boys and girls, ages 7 through 13, compete in simplified cars built from kits purchased from the All-American. These kits assist the Derby novice by providing a step-by-step layout for construction of a basic lean forward style car. The Super Stock Car division, ages 9 through 18, gives the competitor an opportunity to expand their knowledge and build a more advanced model. Both of these beginner levels make use of kits and shells available from the All-American. These entry levels of racing are popular in race communities across the country, as youngsters are exposed to the Derby program for the first time. The Masters division offers boys and girls, ages 10 through 20, an advanced class of racer in which to try their creativity and design skills. Masters entrants may purchase a Scottie Masters Kit with a fiberglass body from the All-American Soap Box Derby.

=== Ultimate Speed Challenge ===

The Ultimate Speed Challenge was a sanctioned racing format that ran from 2004 until 2014 as a way to preserve the tradition of innovation, creativity, and craftsmanship in the design of a gravity powered racing vehicle while generating intrigue, excitement, and engaging the audience at the annual All-American Soap Box Derby competition. The goal of the event was to attract creative entries designed to reach speeds never before attainable at Derby Downs. The competition consisted of three timed runs (one run in each lane), down the track. The car and team that achieved the fastest single run was declared the winner. The timed runs were completed during the All American Soap Box Derby race week.

The open rules of the Ultimate speed Challenge led to a variety of interesting car designs. Winning times improved as wheel technology advanced and the integration between the cars and wheels improved via the use of wheel fairings. Wheels played a key role in a car&#x27;s success. Wheel optimization included a trend towards a smaller diameter (to reduce inertial effects and aerodynamic drag), the use of custom rubber or urethane tires (to reduce rolling resistance), and the use of solvents to swell the tires (also reducing rolling resistance). There was some overlap in technology between this race and other gravity racing events, including the buggy races race at Carnegie Mellon University.

==== Race highlights ====

===== 2004 =====

At the inaugural Ultimate Speed Challenge, the fastest time was achieved by a car designed and built by the Pearson family, driven by Alicia Kimball, and using high performance pneumatic tires. The winning time achieved on the track was 27.190 seconds.

===== 2005 =====

Jerry Pearson returned to defend the title with driver Nicki Henry in the 2005 Ultimate Speed Challenge beating the 2004 record time and breaking the 27.00-second barrier with an elapsed time of 26.953 seconds. Second place went to the DC Derbaticians with a time of 27.085 while third went to Talon Racing of Florida with a time of 27.320.

===== 2006 =====

John Wargo, from California, put together the 2006 Ultimate Speed Challenge winning team with driver Jenny Rodway. Jenny set a new track record of 26.934 seconds. Jenny&#x27;s record stood for 3 years as revisions to the track and ramps after the 2006 race caused winning times to rise in subsequent races. Team Pearson finished 2nd with a time of 26.999 seconds and team Thomas finished 3rd with a time of 27.065.

===== 2007 =====

Team Eliminator, composed of crew chief and designer Jack Barr and driver Lynnel McClellan, achieved victory with a time of 27.160 in the 70th (2007) All-American Soap Box Derby Ultimate Speed Challenge. Jenn Rodway finished 2nd with a time of 27.334 while Hilary Pearson finished 3rd with a time of 27.367.

===== 2008 =====

Jack Barr returned in 2008 with driver Krista Osborne for a repeat team win with a 27.009-second run. Crew chief Tom Schurr and driver Cory Schurr place second with a time of 27.023 while crew chief Mike Albertoni and driver Danielle Hughes were 3rd after posting a time of 27.072.

===== 2009 =====

In the 72nd (2009) AASBD Ultimate Speed Challenge, Derek Fitzgerald&#x27;s Zero-Error Racing team, with driver Jamie Berndt, took advantage of a freshly paved track, and set a new record time of 26.924 seconds. Cory Schurr placed second with a time of 26.987. Laura Overmyer of clean sheet racing finished third with a time of 27.003.

===== 2010 =====

In 2010, Mark Overmyer&#x27;s Clean Sheet/Sigma Nu team (CSSN) and driver Jim Overmyer set the track record at 26.861 seconds in the first heat of the opening round. Several minutes later, driver Sheri Lazowski, also of CSSN, lowered the record to 26.844 seconds, resulting in victory by 0.005 seconds over 2nd-place finisher Jamie Berndt of Zero Error. Competition was tight in 2010, with the top 3 cars finishing within a span of 0.017 seconds.

===== 2011 =====


In 2011, advancements in wheel technology and car design, coupled with ideal track conditions, lead to significantly lower times in the Ultimate Speed Challenge. Driver Kayla Albertoni and crew chief Mike Albertoni broke the record in heat 2 or the opening round with a 26.765, taking 0.079 seconds off the 2010 record. One heat later, driver Jim Overmyer and crew chief Mark Estes of team CSSN racing lowered the record a further 0.133 with a 26.632 run. Jim improved to 26.613 in round 2 to secure 2nd place. In heat 5, of the opening round, driver Kristi Murphy and crew chief Pat Murphy secured 3rd place with a run of 26.677. In the next heat, driver Sheri Lazowski (her car pictured right) and crew chief Mark Overmyer (of CSSN racing) took the victory with a blistering run of 26.585 seconds. Sheri&#x27;s record time was 0.259 seconds under her 2010 record and 0.339 seconds below the 2009 record. Her improvement in 2011 is the largest year-to-year change in the record in the history of the AAUSC race. By winning in both 2010 and 2011, Sheri became the first repeat USC winner.

===== 2012 =====

In 2012, revised starting ramps and a re-sealed track with a softer road surface, led to significant increases in finishing times. The 2012 winner, Laura Overmyer of CSSN racing, with crew chief Mark Estes, posted a winning time of 26.655 seconds, 0.070 seconds slower than the track record set by her team the prior year. Kristi Murphy, of Zero Error racing, finished in 2nd with a time of 26.769, 0.114 seconds back. Jamie Berndt, also of Zero Error racing, finished in 3rd place with a time of 26.827. Competition was not as close as in recent years, with the top 3 cars covering a span of 0.172 seconds. This is roughly double the span in 2009 and 2011 and 10 times the span in 2010. The 2012 results mark the 3rd consecutive win by CSSN racing and the 4th consecutive win by wheel expert Duane Delaney.

===== 2013 =====

The 2013 race was run under wet conditions which necessitated a format change. Each car was given a single run from lane 2 to determine the winner. The running order was randomly determined. CSSN Racing&#x27;s Anne Taylor with crew chief Jerry Pearson won with a time of 26.978. Jillian Brinberg and crew chief Mark Estes, also of CSSN Racing, finished 2nd with a time of 26.992. Catherine Carney with crew chief Lee Carney finished 3rd with a time of 27.162.

===== 2014 =====

In 2014, CSSN&#x27;s Anne Taylor with crew chief Jerry Pearson won with a time of 26.613. Anne&#x27;s time improves on the prior best time for the new gate configuration but falls short of the 2011 record. This marks Anne&#x27;s 2nd consecutive win and the 5th consecutive win for CSSN racing in this event. CSSN&#x27;s Tucker McClaran with crew chief Mark Estes finished second with a time of 26.667. Catherine Carney with crew chief Lee Carney finished 3rd with a time of 26.750.

=== Legacy Division ===

Legacy was introduced in 2019 as a division for older kids and young adults, ages 12 to 20, piloting cars made from scratch instead of the official kits. The intention of Legacy is to appeal to an older demography of participants wishing to carry on the time-honored practice of hand-built racers like the stick cars from the seventies, eighties and nineties. 2024 will mark the fifth running of the Legacy Division Championship. Below are past World Champions.

== Soap Box Derby heritage ==

=== Soap Box Derby Hall of Fame ===

To honor individuals that have made a lasting and profound effect on the Soap Box Derby through significant contributions or dedication to the program, the Soap Box Derby Hall of Fame was instituted in 1997. Derby general manager Jeff Iula pushed for it about ten years before seeing it come to fruition. Inaugural inductees included Derby founder Myron E. Scott—who at the invitation of Iula attended the ceremony, Bain E. &quot;Shorty&quot; Fulton, Jim Schlemmer, Jimmy Stewart and Wilbur Shaw. Since then the Hall of Fame has inducted eighty more, including Ronald Reagan in 1951 when he was a Hollywood leading man, and Ken Cline, the only Soap Box Derby World Champion (1967) to be so honored.

The Soap Box Derby website states &quot;Hall of Fame nominations are accepted each spring. To be considered for the Hall of Fame, candidates must have a minimum of 20 years&#x27; volunteer service at the local or national level or have made a significant financial or sponsorship contribution to the program. Former racers of at least 10 years ago or Derby staff members with a minimum of 10 years&#x27; service also can be nominated.&quot;

==== The Museum ====

The physical component of the Hall of Fame is the Museum itself, dedicated to showcasing Championship racers that won in Akron since the program began. Each year every All-American Champion must pass ownership of their car to the AASBD, which exhibits it in the Museum. During the summer months when racing is in full swing, the Museum is open to the public.

As early as 1979 the idea of an official museum to house these cars was discussed by then general manager Wayne Alley. In a 1985 interview, Jeff Iula stated &quot;The old cars were lying in the barn at Derby Downs, and they were banged up.&quot; With that, Derby track manager Ray Sandy undertook their restoration. In 1981 Derby Downs created the Soap Box Derby Hall of Fame at the Akron Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau in Cascade Plaza, which featured 31 of the 48 extant champ cars as well as historical documents. In 1997 plans were drawn to seek funding for upgrades and an overhaul of the track, with part of it earmarked for construction of a building located behind the grand stand intended to house a museum. This was never built. In 2012 the current museum was created by the FirstEnergy Soap Box Derby, housed in the large outbuilding at the top of the hill (called Topside) at Derby Downs. It houses about half of the 140+ vehicles that have crossed the All-American finishing line as winners over the years, displayed on the floor, or hung vertically or upside down from a steel-framed upper deck at the far end from the main entrance. They include 1947 Soap Box Derby World Champion Kenneth Holmboe (pictured below), and replicas of Robert Gravett&#x27;s 1933 racer and Jim Gronen&#x27;s magnet car from 1973. Along with the cars are plaques and memorabilia. Each summer during Race Week the building serves as the staging facility for all cars entered in ancillary races leading up to and including the All-American. Closed from October to April it doubles as a winter storage facility serving the general public.

==== Gallery of Hall of Fame Museum cars on exhibit ====

These illustrations or photographs depict some of the Derby cars listed above.

=== Retired Derby cars ===

Besides the Hall of Fame Museum cars, there are numerous extant Derby racers now retired to the attics, basements and garages of uncounted American households. 1946 Roanoke, Virginia Champion David Poage was interviewed on WFXR Fox News in August 2023 showing he still had his car after 77 years.

Some Derby survivors become repurposed as decor in public venues like bars and restaurants as prized examples of Americana. Good examples are the End of the Commons General Store in Mesopotamia, Ohio, which has among its many examples of Americana on display two cars placed high above the retail floor: one driven by 1960 Warren, Ohio Champion Allen Frantz, who donated his racer in 2015, and a second (pictured) from 1961 Warren, Ohio class A racer James Chadwick. Other locations include Stables Cafe, a restaurant located in Guthrie, Oklahoma, which has as part its extensive antiques collection an unidentified lay-down racer from the 1970s suspended above the dining area, and Logan&#x27;s Bar and Grill in Freeport, Illinois, which has a racer piloted by Cathy Martin, a class A entry, suspended from the ceiling.

Equally visible and even more numerous than the racers themselves is the plethora of programs, buttons, flags, jerseys, banners, posters and a countless Derby keepsakes and take-away items found frequently on eBay and various websites catering to collectors.

=== Preserved Derby cars ===

=== Ron Reed ===

==== Miniature Derby Models ====

One of the most active participants in preserving Derby heritage is All-American historian, author and model maker Ron Reed, creator of the Ron Reed Miniature Derby Models. The collection showcases detailed scale models of every All-American winning car and top eight runner&#x27;s up since the beginning of the sport in 1934 through to 2007. In 1981 when Ron had already completed 143 cars, his collection was exhibited at the Soap Box Derby Hall of Fame at the Akron Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau in Cascade Plaza. In 2009 it found a home at the AASBD head office building at Derby Downs, enshrined in a glass display case.

Each hand-carved model, which also includes the driver in a crouched position, measures long, so they are not exactly in scale with each other, as the actual cars they are meant to duplicate vary in length. Ron uses bass wood as his carving material. He also does commission work for Derby racers wishing to have their car replicated, and has completed over 500 examples since he began. A resident of Mogadore, Ohio, just east of Akron, Ron attended his first All-American in 1949, and although he never actually raced as a boy—he admitted that he was not adept with tools nor had a place to build a car—he attended almost every All-American since then, missing only three. In that time he snapped over 60,000 photographs of almost every racer that made it to Akron. He does not work from measurements when he replicates a car, using the photographs as a reference point and carving each one by eye. Hand-painted to an exact color match of the original car, Reed admits that duplicating it along with the lettering can be difficult. If he did not have a photo of the car, he would access the Akron Beacon Journal&#x27;s archives, or even fly to another city to find an image in their local newspaper&#x27;s archives or public library.

==== Books penned by Reed ====
In 1983 Jeff Iula, Ron Reed and literary guide Tom Klinger stated that they had a book—&quot;THE&quot; Derby book covering the detailed history of the Soap Box Derby—ready for print, and were seeking a publisher. When nothing came of it, Reed went ahead and self-published four books of his own that covered the history of the sport from 1935 to 1959, beginning with &quot;Tallmadge Hill: The Story of the 1935 All-American Soap Box Derby&quot; in 2013. In 2015 on the 80th anniversary of the 1935 All-American, a commemorative exhibition race was held at the same location as the 1935 race, with one-hundred participants racing down Tallmadge Hill in makeshift Derby cars. Reed, who spoke the opening remarks at the event, helped organize the race with Tallmadge Mayor David Kline.

Books penned by Reed are: &quot;Tallmadge Hill: The Story of the 1935 All-American Soap Box Derby&quot; (2013), &quot;Derby Downs: The 1936 and 1937 All-American Soap Box Derbies&quot; (2014), &quot;The All-American Soap Box Derby: A Review of the Formative Years 1938 thru 1941&quot; (2016), and &quot;A Look Back at the All-American Soap Box Derby 1946–1959&quot; (2018). They open each chapter with an historical summary leading up to the race, the rule changes for that year, celebrities that appeared in the Oil Can Race, details of the most important heats and their participants—including photos, and additional trivia relating to the event.

In 2008 Reed was inducted into the Soap Box Derby Hall of Fame.

=== Vintage Derby Car Show ===

In 2022 the Inaugural Vintage Derby Car Show was held in Akron, Ohio, the first of its kind to showcase extant vintage racers. This was an open invitation to any and all Derby alumni that wished to attend with their old car or cars and keepsakes like trophies, pins and jerseys. Headed by 1967 All-American World Champion and 2017 AASBD Hall of Fame inductee Ken Cline, the one day event comprised twenty seven cars during Soap Box Derby Race Week, one day prior to the All-American World Championship. The oldest car in the exhibit (pictured below) was piloted by 1935 Indianapolis, Indiana Champion Earl Sullivan. The following year the 2nd Annual Vintage Derby Car Show displayed thirty one cars in a larger venue, with ten trophies hand crafted by Cline awarded to the best presentations that day. The 3rd Vintage Derby Car Show took place on July 19, 2024, at the United Steelworkers Local 2L Banquet Hall in Akron, Ohio northwest of Derby Downs, and was open to Derby cars prior to 1999.

<text>William Jessop (23 January 1745 – 18 November 1814) was an English civil engineer, best known for his work on canals, harbours and early railways in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

==Early life==
Jessop was born in Devonport, Devon, the son of Josias Jessop, a foreman shipwright in the Naval Dockyard. Josias Jessop was responsible for the repair and maintenance of Rudyerd&#x27;s Tower, a wooden lighthouse on the Eddystone Rock. He carried out this task for twenty years until 1755, when the lighthouse burnt down. John Smeaton, a leading civil engineer, drew up plans for a new stone lighthouse and Josias became responsible for the overseeing the building work. The two men became close friends, and when Josias died in 1761, two years after the completion of the lighthouse, William Jessop was taken on as a pupil by Smeaton (who also acted as Jessop&#x27;s guardian), working on various canal schemes in Yorkshire.

Jessop worked as Smeaton&#x27;s assistant for a number of years before beginning to work as an engineer in his own right. He assisted Smeaton with the Calder and Hebble and the Aire and Calder navigations in Yorkshire.

==Grand Canal of Ireland==

The first major work that Jessop is known to have carried out was the Grand Canal of Ireland. This had begun as a Government project in 1753, and it had taken seventeen years to build fourteen miles (21 km) of canal from the Dublin end. In 1772 a private company was formed to complete the canal, and consulted John Smeaton. Smeaton sent Jessop to take control of the project as principal engineer. Jessop re-surveyed the proposed line of the canal and carried the canal over the River Liffey, via the Leinster Aqueduct. He also drove the canal across the great Bog of Allen, a feat comparable with George Stephenson&#x27;s crossing of the Chat Moss bog with the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The canal was carried over the bog on a high embankment. Jessop also identified sources of water and built reservoirs, so that the canal was in no danger of running dry. Having seen to all of the important details Jessop returned to England, leaving a deputy in charge to complete the canal. This was finally done in 1805. It seems that Jessop was closely involved with the canal in Ireland until about 1787, after which time, other work flowed in.

==Relationship with other engineers==
Jessop was a very modest man, who did not seek self-aggrandizement. Unlike other engineers, he was not jealous of rising young engineers, but rather encouraged them. He would also recommend another engineer if he was too busy to be able to undertake a commission himself. He recommended John Rennie for the post of engineer to the Lancaster Canal Company, an appointment that helped to establish Rennie&#x27;s reputation. When Jessop was consulting engineer to the Ellesmere Canal Company, in 1793, the company appointed the relatively unknown Thomas Telford as resident engineer. Telford had no previous experience as a designer of canals, but with Jessop&#x27;s advice and guidance, Telford made a success of the project. He supported Telford, even when the Company thought that the latter&#x27;s designs for aqueducts were too ambitious.

==Cromford Canal==

In 1789 Jessop was appointed chief engineer to the Cromford Canal Company. The proposed canal was intended to carry limestone, coal and iron ore from the Derwent and upper Erewash valleys and join the nearby Erewash Canal. The important features of this canal are the Derwent Viaduct, which was a single span viaduct carrying the canal over the River Derwent, and the Butterley Tunnel (formerly the Ripley Tunnel). In 1793, the Derwent Viaduct partially collapsed, and Jessop shouldered the blame, saying that he had not made the front walls strong enough. He had the viaduct repaired and strengthened at his own expense. The Butterley Tunnel was 2,966 yards (2712m) long, wide and high and required thirty-three shafts to be sunk from the surface to build it. Jessop built the Butterley Reservoir above the tunnel, extending for .

==Butterley Company==

In 1790 Jessop founded, jointly with partners Benjamin Outram, Francis Beresford and John Wright, the Butterley Iron Works in Derbyshire to manufacture (amongst other things) cast-iron edge rails – a design Jessop had used successfully on a horse-drawn railway scheme for coal wagons between Nanpantan and Loughborough, Leicestershire (1789). Outram was concerned with the production of ironwork and equipment for Jessop&#x27;s engineering projects.

==Grand Junction Canal==

The Oxford Canal had been built by James Brindley and carried coal to large parts of southern England. However it did not provide a sufficiently direct route between the Midlands and London. As a result, a new canal was proposed to run from the Oxford Canal at Braunston, near Rugby, and to end at the Thames at Brentford, a length of ninety miles. Jessop was appointed Chief Engineer to the Canal Company in 1793. The canal was especially difficult to plan because, whereas other canals tended to follow river valleys and only crossed a watershed when unavoidable, the new canal had to cross the rivers Ouse, Nene and others. An aqueduct was built at Wolverton to carry the canal across the Ouse valley. Whilst the three-arch stone aqueduct was being built, a set of nine temporary locks were used to carry the canal down one side of the valley and up the other. The aqueduct failed in 1808, and was replaced by an iron one in 1811, the iron trough design sharing a similar structure to Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct and the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct built by Thomas Telford. It is known as the Cosgrove aqueduct and was designed and built by Benjamin Bevan.

Two tunnels also had to be built, at Braunston and Blisworth. The Blisworth Tunnel caused great problems, and was unfinished when the rest of the canal was ready. In fact Jessop considered abandoning it and using locks to carry the canal over the ridge. Jessop&#x27;s temporary solution was a railway line laid over the ridge to carry traffic until the tunnel was completed. The Grand Junction Canal was enormously important in encouraging trade between London and the Midlands.

==West India Docks==

The West India Docks, built on the Isle of Dogs, was the first large wet docks built in the Port of London. Between 1800 and 1802 a wet dock area of was created with a depth of , and accommodating 600 ships. Jessop was the Chief Engineer for the docks, with Ralph Walker as his assistant.

==Surrey Iron Railway==
In 1799 separate proposals were put forward for a canal from London to Portsmouth and for a tramway carrying horse-drawn carriages over the same route. The first part of the proposed Surrey Iron Railway was to be from Wandsworth to Croydon, and Jessop was asked for his opinion on the two opposing schemes. He declared that the tramway was a better scheme, as a canal would require too much water and would unduly reduce the supply in the River Wandle. It was agreed to build a tramway from Wandsworth to Croydon, as well a building a basin at Wandsworth. Jessop was appointed Chief Engineer of the project in 1801. In 1802 the Wandsworth Basin and the line were completed. There seems to be doubt as to the gauge of the line with some estimates stating and others stating 4 ft 8½ in.

In 1803, the next phase was authorized for a line from Croydon via Merstham to Godstone in Surrey. Jessop was again appointed Chief Engineer, with his son Josias as his assistant. The line reached Merstham but was never continued to Godstone. The total distance of the tramway from Wandsworth was . The tramway was eventually overtaken by the advent of steam locomotives.

==Later life==

From 1784 to 1805 Jessop lived in Newark in Nottinghamshire, where he twice served as town mayor.

In his later life, Jessop became increasingly inflicted by a form of paralysis, and 1805 marked the end of his active career. He died at his home, Butterley Hall, on 18 November 1814. His son Josias became a successful engineer in his own right.

==Legacy==
Jessop was in the unusual position of bridging the gap between the canal engineers and the railway engineers who came later. His name did not gain the lasting fame that it deserved because of his modesty. Indeed some of his works have been wrongly attributed to engineers who acted as his assistants. Unlike some engineers, such as George Stephenson, Jessop did not stoop to undignified wrangles with fellow professionals. He was highly regarded by almost all those who had worked with him or for him.

<text>The Kiama Blowhole is a blowhole in the town of Kiama, New South Wales, Australia. The name ‘Kiama’ has long been translated as “where the sea makes a noise”. It is one of the town&#x27;s major tourist attractions. Under certain sea conditions, the blowhole can spray 50 litres of water up to 25 metres (82 ft) in the air, in quantities that thoroughly drench any bystanders. There is a second, less famous blowhole in Kiama, commonly referred to as the &quot;Little Blowhole&quot; by locals. It is much smaller than the other (called the &quot;Big Blowhole&quot;), but due to its narrow shape, it is more reliable than the Big Blowhole, and in the right conditions can be equally spectacular.

The blowhole attracts 900,000 tourists a year. Kiama Blowhole is just a few metres beyond the coastline. The &quot;little blowhole&quot; is located at the Little Blowhole Reserve, Tingira Crescent, Kiama, 2 km south of the main blowhole.

The blowhole was formed from basalt lava flows approximately 260 million years ago and was first discovered by local Aboriginals who named it &#x27;Khanterinte&#x27;. The blowhole was first written about by George Bass on 6 December 1797. Bass had captained a crew of six and set out on an open whaleboat to explore the south coast of Australia. He noticed the blowhole after anchoring his boat in a sheltered bay.

In 1992 seven people were drowned when a freak wave washed two Afghan families off the rocks, a tragedy compounded five years later when two more members of one of the families died at the picturesque site.

Despite the local council erecting fences and signs to the danger, tourists can still regularly be seen standing perilously close to the edge as the water explodes through the opening.

== Cause ==
According to the placard at the blow hole, water shoots out of the blowhole because of pressure that forms in an underground chamber. As water fills the chamber at the end of the tunnel, pressure builds. When waves subside, the pressure inside the chamber pushes water up through the blow hole.

<text>Alliston is a settlement in Simcoe County in the Canadian province of Ontario. It has been part of the Town of New Tecumseth since the 1991 amalgamation of Alliston and nearby villages of Beeton, Tottenham, and the Township of Tecumseth. The primary downtown area is located along Highway 89, known as Victoria Street.

The town grew as a commercial centre for the area farmers and was best known as a potato-growing area. It is still a major industry in the town and is celebrated by the annual Alliston Potato Festival. Honda of Canada Manufacturing operates a large auto manufacturing facility southeast of Alliston, currently consisting of three major factories. In the 2016 census, the town of Alliston grew by 25% since 2011 to 19,243 residents making it one of the top 10 fastest growing communities in Canada. This is over 5 times greater than the average growth recorded in Ontario during the same period.

==History==
Alliston traces its history to three brothers, William, John and Dickson Fletcher. Dissatisfied with life in England, the three left for Toronto, working farms in Toronto Gore northwest of the city. In 1821 William purchased Lot 15, Concession 3, Tecumseth Township. He married in 1828, and in 1847 went scouting locations for the construction of a mill with his son John. They chose a location at Lot 1, Concession 1, Essa Township, at the corner where four of the original townships of southern Simcoe County (Adjala, Tosorontio, Essa, and Tecumseth) meet. In early November they built a cabin on the property, and the rest of the family joined them in April the next year. A larger house, known as Fletcher House, was built in 1849, and still stands at 18 Fletcher Crescent.

In 1853 the Fletchers built a grist mill on the Boyne River, a tributary of the Nottawasaga River which runs to the east. The first child born in the new town was Margaret Grant, who was later mother to Frederick Banting. An Orange Lodge was built in 1856, and the next year the members decided to name the village as Alliston. The precise origin of the name remains in some doubt, but the most common story is that it was named for William Fletcher&#x27;s birthplace, likely Allerston in North Yorkshire. A post office was set up the next year, with another Fletcher son, George, the first postmaster. Starting in 1862, George published &quot;&quot;The Alliston Star&quot; newspaper, which changed its name to &quot;Alliston Herald&quot;&quot; in 1871 and continues to be published today. The village was formally incorporated in 1874, with George Fletcher as the reeve.
In 1875, the town was approached by the North Simcoe Railway to run a line from Penetanguishene through Alliston to join the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway. This venture came to nothing, but the organization set up to investigate it later turned to the Hamilton and North-Western Railway to build a new arm from Clarkstown (now Beeton) through Alliston to Collingwood. The town raised $8000 for its portion of the railway from Clarkstown to Glencairn, about halfway to Collingwood.

Alliston was upgraded from &quot;village&quot; to &quot;town&quot; in 1891. On May 8 the same year a fire started in the stables of the Queen&#x27;s Hotel, and was quickly spread by high winds. Collingwood was telegraphed for assistance and sent their fire engine by train, but the downtown area was gutted long before it could arrive. When it did arrive at about 3 in the afternoon, it was sent to the southern side of town where the fire was still burning. In all, of the town were destroyed by the fire, which received the attention of John A. Macdonald. This led to the creation of a waterworks the next year, which included twenty fire hydrants, and the addition of a hook and ladder truck in 1894.

A census in August 1902 stated that 1,475 people were living in the town. A new line of the Canadian Pacific Railway (C.P.R.) reached the town in 1905 or early 1906, with trains arriving later in 1906. The local electric power company, Alliston Electric, was merged into Ontario Hydro on May 24, 1918.

==Geography==
The town has two parks: Riverdale Park to the north along the Boyne River and PPG Park to the south, by the local fire department. Major residential areas are located to the north (as Previn Court Homes) and to the south, with additional residential and commercial developments made since then in the northwest (as &quot;Alliston West&quot;), north and southwest since the mid-1990s, with future developments expected in the future that could raise the population from 17,000 to 20,000. The urban area stretches from west to east, is nearly 5 km, and from north to south ranges from 300 m, 600 m to 3 km. Another residential area, adjacent to the Nottawasaga Inn are located 5 km east of Alliston- the first phase built is known as Green Briar; the second phase, to the west of the Inn is known as Briar Hill. The Nottawasaga River is situated east of the town; the Boyne River, which runs through Alliston, joins the Nottawasaga, just downstream from Nicolston Dam. The CPR (Toronto - Parry Sound - Sudbury) runs right up through the middle of town with a siding for Honda vehicles. Many other business thrive today in Alliston. Honda of Canada Manufacturing has two facilities. The CNR tracks through town were lifted about the mid-1990s and the right-of-way removed.

Earl Rowe Provincial Park is located three kilometers west of Alliston, in the amalgamated Township of Adjala-Tosorontio. It is one of the largest provincial parks in Southern Ontario.

<doc id="462091" wikidata="Q239847" url="?curid=462091" title="Vairocana">
<text>Vairocana (from Sanskrit: Vi+rocana, &quot;from the sun&quot; or &quot;belonging to the sun&quot;, &quot;Solar&quot;, or &quot;Shining&quot;), also known as Mahāvairocana (Great Vairocana), is a major Buddha from Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism. Vairocana is often interpreted, in texts like the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;, as the Dharmakāya of the historical Gautama Buddha. 

In East Asian Buddhism (Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese Buddhism), Vairocana is also seen as the dharmakāya (the supreme buddha-body, the body of ultimate reality), and the embodiment of the Buddhist concept of wisdom and purity. Mahāvairocana is often translated into East Asian languages as &quot;Great Sun Buddha&quot; (Chinese: 大日如來, Japanese: Dainichi Nyorai). In the conception of the Five Jinas of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, Vairocana is at the centre and is often considered a Primordial Buddha. In East Asian esoteric Buddhism, Mahāvairocana is considered to be a cosmic Buddha whose body is the entire universe, the Dharmadhātu.

Vairocana is not to be confused with Vairocana Mahabali, son of the asura Virochana, a character in the &quot;Yoga Vasistha&quot;. Vairocana Buddha is also not to be confused with another Buddha that appears in some Mahayana sources called &quot;Rocana&quot;.

==Literary and historical development==
Vairocana Buddha is first introduced in the &quot;Brahmajala Sutra&quot;:

Vairocana is also mentioned in the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;; however, the doctrine of Vairocana is based largely on the teachings of the &quot;Mahavairocana Tantra&quot; (also known as the ) and to a lesser degree the &quot;Vajrasekhara Sutra&quot; (also known as the Tantra).

In the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;, Vairocana is described as having attained enlightenment immeasurable ages ago and residing in a world purified by him while he was a bodhisattva. He also presides over an assembly of countless other bodhisattvas. He may be considered the celestial existence (saṃbhogakāya) of Gautama Buddha, who came to be as Vairochana&#x27;s earthly rebirth from his previous existence in Tushita heaven. Similarly, the &quot;Brahmajala Sutra&quot; also states that Shakyamuni was originally named Vairochana, regarding the former as a physical incarnation (&quot;nirmāṇakāya&quot;) of the latter.

Vairocana is also mentioned as an epithet of Gautama Buddha in the &quot;Samantabhadra Meditation Sutra&quot;, who dwells in a place called &quot;Always Tranquil Light&quot;. In the Śūraṅgama mantra () taught in the Śūraṅgama sutra (), an especially influential dharani in the Chinese Chan tradition, Vairocana is mentioned to be the host of the Buddha Division in the centre, one of the five major divisions which dispels the vast demon armies of the five directions.

Vairocana is the Primordial Buddha in the Chinese schools of Tiantai, Huayan and Tangmi, also appearing in later schools including the Japanese Kegon, Shingon and esoteric lineages of Tendai. In the case of Huayan and Shingon, Vairocana is the central figure.

In Chinese and Japanese Buddhism, Vairocana was gradually superseded as an object of reverence by Amitābha, due in large part to the increasing popularity of Pure Land Buddhism, but veneration of Vairocana still remains popular among adherents.

During the initial stages of his mission in Japan, the Catholic missionary Francis Xavier was welcomed by the Shingon monks since he used &quot;Dainichi&quot;, the Japanese name for Vairocana, to designate the Christian God. As Xavier learned more about the religious nuances of the word, he substituted the term &quot;Deusu&quot;, which he derived from the Latin and Portuguese &quot;Deus&quot;.

The Shingon monk Dohan regarded the two great Buddhas, Amitābha and Vairocana, as one and the same Dharmakāya Buddha and as the true nature at the core of all beings and phenomena. There are several realizations that can accrue to the Shingon practitioner of which Dohan speaks in this connection, as James Sanford points out:
Helen Hardacre, writing on the &quot;Mahavairocana Tantra&quot;, comments that Mahavairocana&#x27;s virtues are deemed to be immanently universal within all beings: &quot;The principle doctrine of the &quot;Dainichikyo&quot; is that all the virtues of Dainichi (Mahāvairocana) are inherent in us and in all sentient beings.&quot;

According to the &quot;Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra,&quot; the whole universe is a vast pure buddha-field which has been purified by Vairocana Buddha. This is the view of Pure Land which is found in the Chinese Huayan tradition. According to this view, our world is just one small part of this universal Pure Land which is named: &quot;Ocean of worlds, whose surface and inside are decorated with an arrangement of flowers&quot; (Sanskrit: ). It is also called the &quot;Lotus Treasury World&quot; (Chinese: , Skt. ), since it is an array of billions of worlds in a lotus shape.

In the cosmology of the &quot;Avatamsaka sutra,&quot; our world is just one of the immeasurable number of worlds in a multiverse called &quot;Ocean of worlds, whose surface and inside are decorated with an arrangement of flowers&quot; (Kusumatalagarbha-vyuhalamkara-lokadhatu-samudra). The &quot;Avatamsaka&quot; states that this entire cosmos has been purified by the Buddha Vairocana through his bodhisattva practices for countless aeons, after having met countless Buddhas. The sutra also states that our world is in Vairocana&#x27;s buddhafield. Vairocana is closely associated with Shakyamuni Buddha, in some cases he is even identified with him in the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;. Huayan generally sees Shakyamuni as an emanation body (nirmanakaya) from the ultimate Buddha Vairocana (&quot;The Illuminator&quot;). 
Furthermore, Huayan thought sees the entire universe as being the very body of Vairocana, who is seen as a supreme cosmic Buddha. Vairocana is infinite, his influence and light is limitless, pervading the entire universe. Furthermore, Vairocana is really the ultimate principle (li), the Dharmakaya, Suchness and &quot;the substance underlying phenomenal reality&quot;. However, while Vairocana as ultimate principle is eternal, it also transforms and changes according to the needs and conditions of sentient beings. Furthermore, Vairocana is empty, interdependent and interfused with all phenomena in the universe. Thus, Vairocana is both immanent (due to its dependent and interfused character) and transcendent (as the immutable basis of all things).

According to Fazang, while the nirmanakaya Shakyamuni taught the other Mahayana sutras, Vairocana teaches the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot; through his ten bodies which are: the All-Beings Body, the Lands Body, the Karma Body, the Śrāvakas Body, the Pratyekabuddha Body, the Bodhisattvas Body, the Tathāgatas Body, the Wisdom Body, the Dharma Body, and the Space Body. Fazang sees these ten bodies as encompassing all phenomena (animate and inanimate) in the &quot;three realms&quot;, i.e. the entire universe.

== Mantras and Dharanis ==
Numerous mantras, seed syllables and dharanis are associated with Vairocana Buddha.

A common basic mantra is the following:Oṃ Vairocana VaṃAnother popular Vairocana related mantra is the Mantra of Light, which is popular in Japanese Buddhism, including Shingon. This is:
Oṃ Amogha Vairocana Mahāmudrā Maṇipadma Jvala Pravartāya HūṃAnother mantra associated with Vairocana is the following Shingon school mantra:Namo Mahāguru Vairocana Vajra (Jp: namu daishi henjō kongō 南 無 大 師 遍 照 金 剛)This mantra is also the mantra of Kukai, the founder of the Shingon school. Its inner meaning is an invocation to Dharmakāya Mahāvairocana Buddha as the great universal teacher. 

=== Five element mantras ===
Five syllable mantras (Japanese: &quot;goji shingon&quot;) symbolize how all things in the universe (here: the five elements) are modes and emanations of Vairocana. One such mantra which is used in the Shingon school is: aḥ vi ra hūṃ khaṃEach syllable is correlated with earth, water, fire, air, space respectively, while Vairocana is the sixth element - consciousness (vijñana). In the &quot;Mahavairocana sutra&quot; the mantra appears as: Namaḥ samanta-buddhānām a vi ra hūṃ khaṃ. According to East Asian mantrayana writers like Kakuban, this mantra can lead to enlightenment. According to translator Dale A. Todaro, the mantra&#x27;s syllables have numerous symbolic correlations aside from the five elements, including: &quot;the Five Buddhas (Mahavairocana, Aksobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, and Amoghasiddhi respectively); the five colors yellow, white, red, black, and blue; five organs (liver, lungs, heart, kidneys, spleen); five Chinese elements (wood, metal, fire, water, earth); and so on.&quot; 

A slightly longer variation of this mantra, also found in Shingon is:Oṃ a vi ra hūṃ khaṃ vajra dhātu vaṃThis version includes another mantra associated with the Vajradhātu mandala. 

There is another five element mantra of Vairocana, which is: A vaṃ raṃ haṃ khaṃ An alternate version sometimes appears with a Buddha vandana (homage) as follows:Namaḥ samanta-buddhānām A vaṃ raṃ haṃ khaṃ&quot;A&quot; is the seed syllable mantra (bījamantra) of Vairocana in the Garbhadhatu mandala, while &quot;Vaṃ&quot; is the seed syllable of Vairocana in the Vajradhātu mandala. Thus, this five element mantra contains both main seed syllables of Vairocana in the East Asian Esoteric tradition. Furthermore, these two seed syllables are sometimes combined into one mantra: &quot;A-Vaṃ&quot;. 

=== Dharani ===
A longer dharani associated with Vairocana is the &quot;Sarvadurgatiparishodana dharani&quot; (&quot;Complete removal of all unfortunate rebirths&quot;), also known as Kunrig mantra in Tibetan Buddhism. This dharani is found in the &quot;Sarvadurgatiparishodana tantra&quot; which depicts Vairocana at the center of a mandala surrounded by the other four tathagatas&quot;.&quot; The dharani is as follows:
OṂ namo bhagavate sarva durgati pariśodhana rājāya tathāgatāyārhate samyaksambudhāya tadyathā OṂ śodhane śodhane sarva pāpam viśodhani śuddhe viśuddhe sarvakarmāvarana viśodhani svāhā! 

==Statues==
With regard to śūnyatā, the massive size and brilliance of Vairocana statues serve as a reminder that all conditioned existence is empty and without a permanent identity, whereas the Dharmakāya is beyond concepts.

The Spring Temple Buddha of Lushan County, Henan, China, with a height of 126 meters, is the second tallest statue in the world (&quot;see list of tallest statues&quot;).

The Daibutsu in the Tōdai-ji in Nara, Japan, is the largest bronze image of Vairocana in the world.

The larger of the Buddhas of Bamiyan in Afghanistan that were destroyed by the Taliban was also a depiction of Vairocana.

In Java, Indonesia, the ninth-century Mendut temple near Borobudur in Magelang was dedicated to the Dhyani Buddha Vairocana. Built by the Shailendra dynasty, the temple featured a three-meter tall stone statue of Vairocana, seated and performing the dharmachakra mudrā. The statue is flanked with statues of the bodhisattvas Avalokiteśvara and Vajrapani.

<doc id="462099" wikidata="Q1467927" url="?curid=462099" title="Sebadoh">
<text>Sebadoh () is an American indie rock band formed in 1986 in Northampton, Massachusetts, by Eric Gaffney and Lou Barlow, with multi-instrumentalist Jason Loewenstein completing the line-up in 1989. Barlow co-created Sebadoh as an outlet for his songwriting when J. Mascis gradually took over creative control of Dinosaur Jr., in which Barlow plays bass guitar.

Along with such bands as Pavement, Beat Happening and Guided by Voices, Sebadoh helped pioneer a lo-fi style of indie rock characterized by low-fidelity recording techniques that employed four-track cassette tape machines. The band&#x27;s early output, such as &quot;The Freed Man&quot; and &quot;Weed Forestin&#x27;&quot; (both released 1990), as well as &quot;Sebadoh III&quot; (1991), was typical of this style. Following the release of &quot;Bubble &amp; Scrape&quot; in 1993, Gaffney left the band. His replacement and erstwhile stand-in, Bob Fay, appeared on &quot;Bakesale&quot; (1994) and &quot;Harmacy&quot; (1996), but was fired before the sessions for the band&#x27;s major label release &quot;The Sebadoh &quot; (1999), featuring drummer Russ Pollard.

The band then went on a 14-year recording hiatus, during which time members pursued other projects while occasionally touring as Sebadoh. The group, fronted by Barlow and now featuring drummer Bob D&#x27;Amico, returned in 2012 with the &quot;Secret EP&quot; and, in 2013, a full-length album titled &quot;Defend Yourself&quot;, which were both self-recorded. The album &quot;Act Surprised&quot; followed in 2019.

==History==
Lou Barlow was the bass player for alternative rock band Dinosaur Jr. (originally Dinosaur) in the 1980s. While both Barlow and leader J Mascis wrote songs, Mascis&#x27; material dominated the group&#x27;s output because Barlow was intimidated by the guitarist&#x27;s songwriting efforts. Barlow spent progressively more time recording his own songs at home. Barlow and Eric Gaffney released the &quot;Weed Forestin&#x27;&quot; cassette in 1987 on Homestead Records under the name Sebadoh, which was a nonsense word Barlow often muttered in his recordings. Both Barlow and Gaffney contributed songs to &quot;The Freed Man&quot; (1988) cassette. Homestead Records head Gerard Cosloy heard the cassette release of &quot;The Freed Man&quot; and released it as a full-length album on Homestead in 1989. Soon after the cassette&#x27;s release Barlow was kicked out of Dinosaur Jr. Over time Sebadoh&#x27;s releases became a way for Barlow to address the issues of control that manifested as the tension in and his ejection from Dinosaur Jr; Barlow said &quot;I got a lot of hatred out just by writing those songs.&quot; Jason Loewenstein joined in summer 1989, the first release that he played on being the &quot;Gimme Indie Rock&quot; single in 1991. Only ten &#x27;band&#x27; shows were performed throughout Western Massachusetts, Boston, and New York over the period 1989–1990 before the third album, &quot;Sebadoh III&quot;, was released.

After touring with Firehose in 1991, they signed to Sub Pop (Domino in the UK and City Slang in Germany) in 1992, and released the two EPs &quot;Rocking the Forest&quot; and &quot;Sebadoh vs. Helmet&quot; just two months apart. These EPs had their track listings truncated and shuffled around and made into the American full-length release &quot;Smash Your Head on the Punk Rock&quot;. Their fourth album &quot;Bubble &amp; Scrape&quot; was released in April 1993. The same year, the band&#x27;s &quot;Soul and Fire&quot; EP humorously described the band&#x27;s musical goal as &quot;driving dozens of college-age lemmings off the cliff of limited imagination.&quot;

Following &quot;Bubble &amp; Scrape&quot; (1993) Gaffney left the band. Gaffney has stated that he left Sebadoh &quot;because I felt like it&quot; and went on to explain that: &quot;I wanted to start a band where I was the songwriter/guitar player and so I did. I also had the garage practice space and booked all our early shows. This was summer 1989, when The Freed Man LP was released on Homestead was when I called those guys on the phone to ask if they wanted to start a band, met with dead silence. Me on the other end saying, “Are you still there?” I only started playing drums when the other guys wanted to play their songs because I didn’t want to learn bass lines, and drums are my first instrument. Four years later I let the whole thing walk away from me. It was like The Blob—you want to just run out of the theater! (lest you be consumed by “The Blob.”).&quot;

Barlow has stated that the mood in the band upon Gaffney&#x27;s departure was &quot;euphoric,&quot; explaining that: &quot;Eric was a difficult guy. He was really struggling with the band becoming more popular; he was really struggling with sharing the spotlight with me. He’s an absolute leader, and deserves a spotlight of his own, but I had kind of forced him into this band where he and I were going to be trading off, thinking that was a really great idea. Eric Gaffney did not want to be doing that. Eric Gaffney wanted to be front and center—which is great, I mean, I believed in him. I’m an Eric Gaffney fan, that’s why I was playing in a band with him, but Eric Gaffney was not a Lou Barlow fan. So him leaving the band was awesome. All of this resistance just disappeared for a while, and it was really nice.&quot;

Gaffney&#x27;s replacement, Bob Fay, appeared on &quot;Bakesale&quot; (1994) and the follow-up &quot;Harmacy&quot; in 1996. Fay was fired before the sessions for &quot;The Sebadoh&quot; (1999) and replaced by Russ Pollard, a friend of Loewenstein&#x27;s from Louisville. The band went on a tour to promote this album, including a stop in Toronto in March. The band then went on hiatus, with Barlow concentrating on his other project, the Folk Implosion, and Loewenstein working on material for his debut solo album &quot;At Sixes and Sevens&quot;, released in 2002. The two reunited to play concerts in late 2003 and early 2004.

In March 2007, the &quot;Sebadoh Classic&quot; lineup of Barlow, Gaffney and Loewenstein went on tour together for the first time in fourteen years. This coincided with a new series of reissues which repackaged some of the early albums with extra discs of unreleased tracks. First came a reissue of &quot;Sebadoh III&quot;, then &quot;The Freed Man&quot;, and &quot;Bubble &amp; Scrape&quot;.

The reunion tour continued into 2008, and in May included a live performance of &quot;Bubble &amp; Scrape&quot; (1993) in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties curated Don&#x27;t Look Back series at London&#x27;s Koko venue.

In 2011, Sebadoh toured in support of reissues for their &quot;Bakesale&quot; and &quot;Harmacy&quot; albums. Though &quot;Bakesale&quot; was reissued on time, as of June 2015, &quot;Harmacy&quot; has still not been reissued. Taking the place of Gaffney on drums was Bob D&#x27;Amico, who plays with Loewenstein in both Circle of Buzzards and the Fiery Furnaces.

In March 2012, Lou Barlow reissued the early recordings of &quot;Weed Forrestin&quot;&#x27; on the Sebadoh bandcamp, available in a digital download, double cd, vinyl, and deluxe edition with the &quot;Child of the Apocalypse&quot; sessions as a cassette tape. Fifty copies of &quot;Weed Forrestin&quot; came as a surprise bonus with purchases of the limited edition re-release of Dinosaur Jr.&#x27;s first three albums in a cassette boxed set released by Joyful Noise in 2012.

They were chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival that he curated in March 2012 in Minehead, England.

In July 2012, Sebadoh released &quot;Secret EP&quot; on the Sebadoh bandcamp, available in a digital download. CD copies were only available at the shows of their 2012 tour. In June 2013, Joyful Noise released it on vinyl.

Their eighth studio album, &quot;Defend Yourself&quot;, came out on Joyful Noise Recordings on September 17, 2013. It debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;New Alternative Artists&quot; Billboard chart, since the band had been together for roughly 27 years at that point in time.

On March 1, 2019, the band announced that their ninth studio album &quot;Act Surprised&quot; will be released on May 24, 2019, via Dangerbird Records. 
The same day the first single off the album, &quot;Celebrate the Void&quot; was released.

<doc id="462105" wikidata="Q2628983" url="?curid=462105" title="Operation Jedburgh">
<text>Operation Jedburgh was a clandestine operation during World War II in which three-man teams of operatives of the British Special Operations Executive (SOE), the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the Free French Bureau central de renseignements et d&#x27;action (&quot;Central Bureau of Intelligence and Operations&quot;) and the Dutch and Belgian armies in exile were dropped by parachute into occupied France, the Netherlands and Belgium. The objective of the Jedburgh teams was to assist allied forces who invaded France on 6 June 1944 with sabotage and guerrilla warfare, and leading local resistance forces in actions against the Germans.

The name of the operation was chosen at random from a Ministry of Defence code book, although several of those who took part in the operation later reflected that the name was apt as the town of Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders was notorious in the late Middle Ages for the activities of the raiders known as the Border Reivers.

Operation Jedburgh represented the first real cooperation in Europe between SOE and the Special Operations Branch of OSS. By this period in the war, SOE had insufficient resources to mount the huge operation on its own; for example, it had access to only 23 Handley Page Halifax aircraft for dropping agents and stores, barely sufficient to maintain SOE&#x27;s existing networks. OSS was able to augment this force with Consolidated B-24 Liberator aircraft operating from RAF Harrington (see Operation Carpetbagger).

The OSS sought to be involved since, in a single swoop, this would result in the OSS inserting more agents into northwestern Europe than it had during the entire previous period of US involvement in the war. Nevertheless, General Eisenhower, the American Supreme Commander, ensured that the French would lead the operation and on 9 June 1944 gave command of the Jedburgh teams to France.

==Origins==
The British Special Operations Executive (SOE) and its American counterpart, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), came up with the concept of the Jedburghs in May 1943. The idea was that small groups of military personnel would be inserted by parachute inside territory occupied by Nazi Germany to assist local resistance forces and to carry out military operations. Unlike SOE agents who worked in occupied Europe, the Jedburgh teams would be armed and uniformed military personnel. Fluency in the language of the European country where they would operate was required, although the language requirement was reduced for radio operators. The &quot;Jeds,&quot; as the men on Operation Jedburgh teams were called, were all volunteers. Jedburgh operations were also carried out in some Asian countries.

==Jedburgh teams==

The Jedburgh teams were known by codenames which usually were first names (such as &quot;Hugh&quot;), with some names of medicines (such as &quot;Novocaine&quot;) and a few random names thrown in to confuse German intelligence. The teams normally consisted of three men: a commander, an executive officer, and a non-commissioned radio operator. One of the officers would be British or American while the other would originate from the country to which the team deployed. The radio operator could be of any nationality.

About 300 Jeds were selected. After about two weeks of paramilitary training at commando training bases in the Scottish Highlands, they moved to Milton Hall near Peterborough, which was much closer to the airfields from which they were to be launched, and to London and Special Force Headquarters. At Milton Hall they received an intensive course in unarmed combat and sabotage techniques.

In addition to their personal weapons (which included an M1 carbine and a Colt automatic pistol for each member) and sabotage equipment, the teams dropped with the Type B Mark II radio, more commonly referred to as the B2 or &quot;Jed Set&quot;, which was critical for communicating with Special Force Headquarters in London. They were also issued pieces of silk with five hundred phrases that they were likely to use in radio traffic replaced with four-letter codes to save time in transmission, and one-time pads to encipher their messages. Each officer wore a money belt containing 100,000 francs (about 500 British pounds or 2,500 U.S. dollars) and 50 U.S. dollars. Radio operators carried only 50,000 francs. The money was to distribute to resistance fighters, called maquis in France, many of whom had families to support. Equipment and supplies were airdropped with the Jeds.

==Operations in France==
France was by far the most important country of Jedburgh operations. Ninety-three teams were inserted into France. The nationalities of 278 Jeds on the teams were: 89 French officers and 17 radio operators, 47 British officers and 38 radio operators, and 40 American officers and 37 radio operators. Thirteen of the Jeds undertook a second mission. The officers were lieutenants, captains, and a few majors. Radio operators were usually sergeants. The teams were parachuted into France from June to September 1944. Several of the teams inserted in August and September landed to find themselves in territory already liberated by the rapid advance of the allied armies.

The first team in, codenamed &quot;Hugh&quot;, parachuted into central France near Châteauroux on 5/6 June 1944, the night before the Allied landings in Normandy, codenamed Operation Overlord. The Jedburgh teams normally parachuted in by night to meet a reception committee from a local Resistance or &quot;maquis&quot; group. Their main function was to provide a link between the guerrillas and the Allied command. They could provide liaison, advice, expertise and leadership, but their most powerful asset was their ability to arrange airdrops of arms and ammunition.

Like all Allied forces who operated behind Nazi lines, the Jedburghs were subject to torture and execution in the event of capture, under Hitler&#x27;s notorious Commando Order. Because the teams normally operated in uniform, to apply this order to them was a war crime. However, of the Jedburgh teams dropped into France, only British Captain Victor A. Gough met that fate, being shot while a prisoner on 25 November 1944.

==Jedburgh operations in The Netherlands==
From September 1944 to April 1945, eight Jedburgh teams were active in the Netherlands. The first team, code named &quot;Dudley,&quot; was parachuted into the east of the Netherlands one week before Operation Market Garden. The next four teams were attached to the Airborne forces that carried out Market Garden. After the mixed results of Market Garden, one Jedburgh team trained (former) resistance men in the liberated South of the Netherlands.

In April 1945 the last two Dutch Jedburgh teams became operational. One team code named &quot;Gambling&quot;, was a combined Jedburgh/Special Air Service (SAS) group that was dropped into the centre of the Netherlands to assist the Allied advance. The last team was parachuted into the Northern Netherlands as part of SAS operation &quot;Amherst&quot;. Despite the fact that operating clandestinely in the flat and densely populated Netherlands was very difficult for the Jedburghs, the teams were quite successful.

==Jedburgh operations in South East Asia==

Jedburgh teams, or parties organised on a similar basis, also operated under the command of Lord Mountbatten in the South East Asia Command (SEAC) areas in 1945, including Japanese-occupied French Indo-China, where sixty French Jedburghs joined the newly created Corps Léger d&#x27;Intervention (C.L.I.) fighting the Japanese occupation.

In Burma, Jedburgh teams were used in operations &quot;Billet&quot; and &quot;Character&quot;. &quot;Billet&quot; was a plan to raise resistance to the Japanese among the majority Burman population, primarily through the largely communist Anti-Fascist Organisation (AFO). &quot;Character&quot; was a scheme to raise the minority Karen people in the Karen Hills between the Sittang and Salween Rivers. The first Jeds to go on Character operations were flown into Burma in February 1945 with Lieutenant Colonel Peacock&#x27;s Special Groups.

==Aftermath==

Many of the surviving American &quot;Jeds&quot; later held various positions of great responsibility in the US Army or the CIA. Examples include William Colby, who became director of the CIA, Lucien Conein, who was a key CIA officer in Vietnam, General John Singlaub and Colonel Aaron Bank (first commander of United States Army Special Forces).

Among French Jedburghs were Paul Aussaresses, later founder of the SDECE&#x27;s 11e RPC, and served in French Algeria; Jean Sassi, another who later served in the 11e RPC, who pioneered conventional guerrilla commandos GCMA with Roger Trinquier during the First Indochina War; Guy Le Borgne, commander of the 8e Choc Parachute Battalion in Indochina, the 3rd Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment in Algeria and 11th Parachute Division. Brig. General Joe Haraki SOE, Special Operations Mediterranean SO(M), special forces in Lebanon, ISF Commander Internal Security Forces.

==In popular culture==
===&quot;You&#x27;re Stepping on My Cloak and Dagger&quot;===

In &quot;You&#x27;re Stepping on My Cloak and Dagger&quot;, a memoir of his offbeat adventures as an agent in the OSS, Roger Wolcott Hall describes his work with the Jedburghs.

Hall&#x27;s first assignment with the OSS was as a Special Operations instructor at the Congressional Country Club in Maryland, which had been converted into a training center. Hall trained several classes of OSS recruits from which American members of the Jedburghs were later chosen. Hall instructed the recruits in Special Operations tactics and demolition, often leading them on simulated night raids on the country club&#x27;s golf course.

Hall himself was supposed to be the leader of a Jedburgh team that would parachute into Denmark and conduct Special Operations behind enemy lines. However, the operation was cancelled when &quot;someone in the OSS discovered that Denmark is as flat as a pancake. There&#x27;s very little natural ground cover. A Special Operations team [in occupied German territory] would be lucky to last 72 hours there.&quot;

In 1944, while stationed in England, Hall was assigned to join a Jedburgh team in occupied France and coordinate resistance operations following the D-Day invasion. However, the operation did not go as planned. Hall parachuted into France and linked up with the Jedburgh team, only to discover that a sudden offensive by General George S. Patton&#x27;s tank divisions had pushed through the area a few hours before, and he had landed in friendly territory. Hall was back in London two days later.

===&quot;War and Remembrance&quot;===
In the historical fiction novel &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; by Herman Wouk and its television miniseries, the fictional character Leslie Slote joined the Jedburghs, leading a team to organize French resistance.

===&quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;===
In the 1985 BBC thriller series &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; a key American character is named Jedburgh, a reference to the OSS&#x27;s involvement in Operation Jedburgh.

=== &quot;Classified France &#x27;44&quot; ===
In 2024 game developer Absolute Games and Publisher Team17 released Classified France &#x27;44. A turn-based tactical game, the player leads a Jedburgh team in the run up to D-Day conducting a series of operations across northern France.

=== &quot;A Call to Spy&quot; ===
Tells the story Virginia Hall and Noor Inayat Khan and what they did with OSS and SOE in France as part of Operation Jedburgh.

<doc id="462109" wikidata="Q854997" url="?curid=462109" title="Bhikkhu">
<text>A bhikkhu (, ) is an ordained male in Buddhist monasticism. Male, and female monastics (&quot;bhikkhunī&quot;), are members of the Sangha (Buddhist community).

The lives of all Buddhist monastics are governed by a set of rules called the prātimokṣa or pātimokkha. Their lifestyles are shaped to support their spiritual practice: to live a simple and meditative life and attain nirvana.

A person under the age of 20 cannot be ordained as a bhikkhu or bhikkhuni but can be ordained as a śrāmaṇera or śrāmaṇērī.

==Definition==
&quot;Bhikkhu&quot; literally means &quot;beggar&quot; or &quot;one who lives by alms&quot;. The historical Buddha, Prince Siddhartha, having abandoned a life of pleasure and status, lived as an alms mendicant as part of his śramaṇa lifestyle. Those of his more serious students who renounced their lives as householders and came to study full-time under his supervision also adopted this lifestyle. These full-time student members of the sangha became the community of ordained monastics who wandered from town to city throughout the year, living off alms and stopping in one place only for the Vassa, the rainy months of the monsoon season.

In the &quot;Dhammapada&quot; commentary of Buddhaghoṣa, a bhikkhu is defined as &quot;the person who sees danger (in samsara or cycle of rebirth)&quot; (Pāli: &quot;ikkhatīti: bhikkhu&quot;). Therefore, he seeks ordination to obtain release from the cycle of rebirth. The &quot;Dhammapada&quot; states:

Buddha accepted female bhikkhunis after his step-mother Mahapajapati Gotami organized a women&#x27;s march to Vesāli and Buddha requested her to accept the Eight Garudhammas. So, Gotami agreed to accept the Eight Garudhammas and was accorded the status of the first bhikkhuni. Subsequent women had to undergo full ordination to become nuns.

==Ordination==
The &quot;bhikkhu&quot; order, in its earliest form, upheld continuous movement for eight months a year, and ate one meal a day, received from begging.

===Theravada===
Theravada monasticism is organized around the guidelines found within a division of the Pāli Canon called the &quot;Vinaya Pitaka&quot;. Laypeople undergo ordination as a novitiate (śrāmaṇera or sāmanera) in a rite known as the &quot;going forth&quot; (Pali: &quot;pabbajja&quot;). Sāmaneras are subject to the Ten Precepts. From there full ordination (Pali: &quot;upasampada&quot;) may take place. Bhikkhus are subject to a much longer set of rules known as the Pātimokkha (Theravada) or Prātimokṣa (Mahayana and Vajrayana).

===Mahayana===
In the Mahayana monasticism is part of the system of &quot;vows of individual liberation&quot;. These vows are taken by monks and nuns from the ordinary sangha, in order to develop personal ethical discipline. In Mahayana and Vajrayana, the term &quot;sangha&quot; is, in principle, often understood to refer particularly to the &quot;aryasangha&quot; (), the &quot;community of the noble ones who have reached the first bhūmi&quot;. These, however, need not be monks and nuns.

The vows of individual liberation are taken in four steps. A lay person may take the five upāsaka and upāsikā vows (, &quot;approaching virtue&quot;). The next step is to enter the pabbajja or monastic way of life (Skt: &quot;pravrajyā&quot;, ), which includes wearing monk&#x27;s or nun&#x27;s robes. After that, one can become a samanera or samaneri &quot;novice&quot; (Skt. &quot;śrāmaṇera&quot;, &quot;śrāmaṇeri&quot;, ). The final step is to take all the vows of a bhikkhu or bhikkhuni &quot;fully ordained monastic&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;bhikṣu, bhikṣuṇī&quot;, ).

Monastics take their vows for life but can renounce them and return to non-monastic life and even take the vows again later. A person can take them up to three times or seven times in one life, depending on the particular practices of each school of discipline; after that, the sangha should not accept them again. In this way, Buddhism keeps the vows &quot;clean&quot;. It is possible to keep them or to leave this lifestyle, but it is considered extremely negative to break these vows.

In 9th century Japan, the monk Saichō believed the 250 precepts were for the Śrāvakayāna and that ordination should use the Mahayana precepts of the &quot;Brahmajala Sutra&quot;. He stipulated that monastics remain on Mount Hiei for twelve years of isolated training and follow the major themes of the 250 precepts: celibacy, non-harming, no intoxicants, vegetarian eating and reducing labor for gain. After twelve years, monastics would then use the Vinaya precepts as a provisional or supplemental, guideline to conduct themselves by when serving in non-monastic communities. Tendai monastics followed this practice.

During Japan&#x27;s Meiji Restoration during the 1870s, the government abolished celibacy and vegetarianism for Buddhist monastics in an effort to secularise them and promote the newly created State Shinto. Japanese Buddhists won the right to proselytize inside cities, ending a five-hundred year ban on clergy members entering cities. Currently, priests (lay religious leaders) in Japan choose to observe vows as appropriate to their family situation. Celibacy and other forms of abstaining are generally &quot;at will&quot; for varying periods of time.

After the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910, when Japan annexed Korea, Korean Buddhism underwent many changes. and Nichiren schools began sending missionaries to Korea under Japanese rule and new sects formed there such as Won Buddhism. The Temple Ordinance of 1911 () changed the traditional system whereby temples were run as a collective enterprise by the Sangha, replacing this system with Japanese-style management practices in which temple abbots appointed by the Governor-General of Korea were given private ownership of temple property and given the rights of inheritance to such property. More importantly, monks from pro-Japanese factions began to adopt Japanese practices, by marrying and having children.

In Korea, the practice of celibacy varies. The two sects of Korean Seon divided in 1970 over this issue; the Jogye Order is fully celibate while the Taego Order has both celibate monastics and non-celibate Japanese-style priests.

==== Vajrayana ====
In Tibet, the upāsaka, pravrajyā and bhikṣu ordinations are usually taken at ages six, fourteen and twenty-one or older, respectively.

Tibetan Vajrayana often calls ordained monks lama.

==== Additional vows in the Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions ====
In Mahayana traditions, a Bhikṣu may take additional vows not related to ordination, including the Bodhisattva vows, samaya vows and others, which are also open to laypersons in most instances.

===Robes===


The special dress of ordained people, referred to in English as robes, comes from the idea of wearing a simple durable form of protection for the body from weather and climate. In each tradition, there is uniformity in the color and style of dress. Color is often chosen due to the wider availability of certain pigments in a given geographical region. In Tibet and the Himalayan regions (Kashmir, Nepal and Bhutan), red is the preferred pigment used in the dyeing of robes. In Myanmar, reddish brown; In India, Sri Lanka and South-East Asia, various shades of yellow, ochre and orange prevail. In China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam, gray or black is common. Monks often make their own robes from cloth that is donated to them.

The robes of Tibetan novices and monks differ in various aspects, especially in the application of &quot;holes&quot; in the dress of monks. Some monks tear their robes into pieces and then mend these pieces together again. Upāsakas cannot wear the &quot;chö-göö&quot;, a yellow tissue worn during teachings by both novices and full monks.

In observance of the Kathina Puja, a special Kathina robe is made in 24 hours from donations by lay supporters of a temple. The robe is donated to the temple or monastery and the resident monks then select from their own number a single monk to receive this special robe.

==Historical terms in Western literature==
In English literature before the mid-20th century, Buddhist monks, particularly from East Asia and French Indochina, were often referred to by the term &quot;bonze&quot;. This term is derived from Portuguese and French . It is rare in modern literature.

Buddhist monks were once called &quot;talapoy&quot; or &quot;talapoin&quot; , itself , ultimately .

The talapoin is a monkey named after Buddhist monks, much like the capuchin monkey is named after the Catholic Capuchin friars.

<text>The occupation of the Baltic states was a period of annexation of
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania by the Soviet Union from 1940 until its dissolution in 1991. For a period of several years during World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the Baltic states after it invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.

The initial Soviet invasion and occupation of the Baltic states began in June 1940 under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, made between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany in August 1939 before the outbreak of World War II. The three independent Baltic countries were annexed as constituent Republics of the Soviet Union in August 1940. Most Western countries did not recognise this annexation, and considered it illegal. In July 1941, the occupation of the Baltic states by Nazi Germany took place, just weeks after its invasion of the Soviet Union. The Third Reich incorporated them into its &quot;Reichskommissariat Ostland&quot;. In 1944, the Soviet Union recaptured most of the Baltic states as a result of the Red Army&#x27;s Baltic Offensive, trapping the remaining German forces in the Courland Pocket until their formal surrender in May 1945.
During the 1944–1991 Soviet occupation many people from Russia and other parts of the former USSR were settled in the three Baltic countries, while the local languages, religion and customs were suppressed in an &quot;extremely violent and traumatic&quot; occupation. Colonization of the three Baltic countries included mass executions, deportations and repression of the native population. 

While there has been a broad international consensus that the Baltic states were illegally occupied and annexed, the Soviet Union never acknowledged that they were forcefully taken over. The post-Soviet government of Russia maintains the claim that the incorporations of Baltic states was in accordance with international law, and school textbooks state that the Baltic states voluntarily joined the Soviet Union after home-grown popular socialist revolutions. As most Western governments maintained that Baltic sovereignty had not been legitimately overridden, they thus continued to recognise the Baltic states as sovereign political entities represented by the Baltic Legations, which functioned in Washington and elsewhere as governments in exile. 

The Baltic states regained &quot;de facto&quot; independence in 1991 during the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Russia started to withdraw its troops from the Baltics starting with Lithuania in August 1993. However, it was a violent process and Soviet forces killed several Latvians and Lithuanians. The full withdrawal of troops deployed by Moscow ended in August 1994. Russia officially ended its military presence in the Baltics in August 1998 by decommissioning the Skrunda-1 radar station in Latvia. The dismantled installations were repatriated to Russia and the site returned to Latvian control, with the last Russian soldier leaving Baltic soil in October 1999.

==Background==
Early in the morning of 24 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany signed a ten-year non-aggression pact, called the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact. The pact contained a secret protocol by which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet &quot;spheres of influence&quot;. In the north, Finland, Estonia and Latvia were assigned to the Soviet sphere. Poland was to be partitioned in the event of its &quot;political rearrangement&quot;—the areas east of the Narev, Vistula and San Rivers going to the Soviet Union while Germany would occupy the west. Lithuania, adjacent to East Prussia, would be in the German sphere of influence, although a second secret protocol agreed in September 1939 assigned the majority of Lithuanian territory to the Soviet Union. Under the secret protocol, Lithuania would regain its historical capital Vilnius, previously subjugated during the inter-war period by Poland.

Following the end of the Soviet invasion of Poland on 6 October, the Soviets pressured Finland and the Baltic states to conclude mutual assistance treaties. The Soviets questioned the neutrality of Estonia after the escape of an interned Polish submarine on 18 September. On 24 September, the Estonian foreign minister was given an ultimatum: The Soviets demanded a treaty of mutual assistance to establish military bases in Estonia. The Estonians were coerced to accept naval, air and army bases on two Estonian islands and at the port of Paldiski. The corresponding agreement was signed on 28 September 1939. Latvia followed on 5 October 1939 and Lithuania shortly thereafter, on 10 October 1939. The agreements permitted the Soviet Union to establish military bases on the Baltic states&#x27; territory for the duration of the European war and to station 25,000 Soviet soldiers in Estonia, 30,000 in Latvia and 20,000 in Lithuania starting October 1939.

==Soviet occupation and annexation (1940–1941)==
In May 1940, the Soviets turned to the idea of direct military intervention, but still intended to rule through puppet regimes. Their model was the Finnish Democratic Republic, a puppet regime set up by the Soviets on the first day of the Winter War. The Soviets organised a press campaign against the allegedly pro-Allied sympathies of the Baltic governments. In May 1940, the Germans invaded France, which was overrun and occupied a month later. In late May and early June 1940, the Baltic states were accused of military collaboration against the Soviet Union by holding meetings the previous winter. On 15 June 1940, the Lithuanian government was extorted to agree to the Soviet ultimatum and permit the entry of an unspecified number of Soviet troops. President Antanas Smetona proposed armed resistance to the Soviets but the government refused, proposing their own candidate to lead the regime. However, the Soviets refused this proposal and sent Vladimir Dekanozov to take charge while the Red Army occupied the state.

On 16 June 1940, Latvia and Estonia also received ultimata. The Red Army occupied the two remaining Baltic states shortly thereafter. The Soviets dispatched Andrey Vyshinsky to oversee the takeover of Latvia and Andrey Zhdanov to Estonia. On 18 and 21 June 1940, new &quot;popular front&quot; governments were formed in each Baltic country, made up of Communists and fellow travelers. Under Soviet surveillance, the new governments arranged rigged elections for new &quot;people&#x27;s assemblies.&quot; Voters were presented with a single list, and no opposition movements were allowed to file candidates. To get the required turnout to 99.6%, votes were forged. A month later when the new assemblies met their sole item of business for each of them was a resolution to join the Soviet Union. In each case, the resolution passed by acclamation. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union duly accepted the requests in August, thus sanctioning them under Soviet law. Lithuania was incorporated into the Soviet Union on 3 August, Latvia on 5 August, and Estonia on 6 August 1940. The deposed presidents of Estonia and Latvia, Konstantin Päts and Kārlis Ulmanis, were deported to the USSR and imprisoned. They died later in the Tver region and Central Asia respectively. In June 1941, the new Soviet governments carried out mass deportations of &quot;enemies of the people&quot;. Estonia alone lost an estimated 60,000 citizens. Consequently, many Balts initially greeted the Germans as liberators when they invaded a week later.
The Soviet Union immediately started to erect border fortifications along its newly acquired western border — the so-called Molotov Line.

==German occupation (1941–1945)==
===Ostland province and the Holocaust===

On 22 June 1941 the Germans invaded the Soviet Union. The Baltic states, recently Sovietized by threats, force, and fraud, generally welcomed the German armed forces. In Lithuania, a revolt broke out and an independent provisional government was established. As the German armies approached Riga and Tallinn, attempts to reestablish national governments were made. Baltic citizens hoped that the Germans would reestablish Baltic independence. Such hopes soon evaporated and Baltic cooperation became less forthright or ceased altogether. The Germans aimed to annex the Baltic territories into the Third Reich where &quot;suitable elements&quot; would be assimilated and &quot;unsuitable elements&quot; exterminated. In practice, the implementation of occupation policy was more complex; for administrative convenience the Baltic states were included with Belorussia in the Reichskommissariat Ostland. The area was governed by Hinrich Lohse who was obsessed with bureaucratic regulations. The Baltic area was the only eastern region intended to become a full province of the Third Reich. Nazi racial attitudes to the peoples of the three Baltic countries differed between Nazi authorities. In practice, racial policies were directed not against the majority of Balts but rather against the Jews. Large numbers of Jews were living in the major cities, notably in Vilnius, Kaunas and Riga. The German mobile killing units slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Jews; Einsatzgruppe A, assigned to the Baltic area, was the most effective of four units. German policy forced the Jews into ghettos. In 1943 Heinrich Himmler ordered his forces to liquidate the ghettos and to transfer the survivors to concentration camps. Some Latvians and Lithuanian conscripts collaborated actively in the killing of Jews, and the Nazis managed to provoke pogroms locally, especially in Lithuania. Only about 75 percent of Estonian and 10 percent of Latvian and Lithuanian Jews survived the war. However, for the majority of Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians, the German rule was less harsh than Soviet rule had been, and it was less brutal than German occupations elsewhere in eastern Europe. Local puppet regimes performed administrative tasks and schools were permitted to function. However, most people were denied the right to own land or businesses.

===Baltic nationals within the Soviet forces===

The Soviet administration had forcibly incorporated the Baltic national armies at the wake of the occupation in 1940. Most of the senior officers were arrested and many of them murdered. During the German invasion, the Soviets conducted a forced general mobilisation that took place in violation of the international law. Under the Geneva Conventions, this act of violence is seen as a grave breach and war crime, because the mobilised men were treated as arrestants from the very beginning. In comparison with the general mobilisation proclaimed in the Soviet Union, the age range was extended by 9 years in the Baltics; all reserve officers were also taken. The aim was to deport all men capable to fight to Russia, where they were sent to convict camps. Almost half of them perished because of the transportation conditions, slave labour, hunger, diseases, and the repressive measures of the NKVD. In addition, destruction battalions were formed under the command of the NKVD. Hence, Baltic nationals fought in both German and Soviet army ranks. There was the 201st Latvian Rifle Division. The 308th Latvian Rifle Division was awarded the Red Banner Order after the expulsion of the Germans from Riga in the autumn of 1944.

An estimated 60,000 Lithuanians were drafted into the Red Army. During 1940, on the basis of disbanded Lithuanian Army, Soviet authorities organized 29th Territorial Rifle Corps. Decrease in quality of life and service conditions, forceful indoctrination of Communist ideology, caused discontent of recently Sovietized military units. Soviet authorities responded with repressions against Lithuanian officers of the 29th Corps, arresting over 100 officers and soldiers and subsequently executing around 20 in Autumn 1940. By that time allegedly near 3,200 officers and soldiers of 29th Corps were considered &quot;politically unreliable&quot;. Due to high tensions and soldiers&#x27; discontent the 26th Cavalry Regiment was disbanded. During the 1941 June deportations over 320 officers and soldiers of 29th Corps were arrested and deported to concentration camps or executed. The 29th Corps collapsed with the German invasion into Soviet Union: on June 25–26 a rebellion broke in its 184th Rifle Division. The other division of the 29th Corps, the 179th Rifle Division lost most of its soldiers during the retreat from Germans mostly to deserting of its soldiers. A total of less than 1,500 soldiers from initial strength of around 12,000 reached the area of Pskov by August 1941. By the second part of 1942, most of Lithuanians remaining in the Soviet ranks as well as male war refugees from Lithuania were organized into 16th Rifle Division during its second formation. 16th Rifle Division, despite officially called &quot;Lithuanian&quot; and mostly commanded by officers of Lithuanian origin, including Adolfas Urbšas, was ethnically very mixed, with up to 1/4 of its personnel made of Jews and thus being the largest Jew formation of Soviet Army. Popular joke of those years said that 16th Division is called Lithuanian, because there are 16 Lithuanians among its ranks.

The 7000-strong 22nd Estonian Territorial Rifle Corps got heavily beaten in the battles around Porkhov during the German invasion in summer 1941, as 2000 were killed or wounded in action, and 4500 surrendered. The 25,000—30,000 strong 8th Estonian Rifle Corps lost 3/4 of its troops in the Battle of Velikiye Luki in winter 1942/43. It participated in the capture of Tallinn in September 1944. About 20,000 Lithuanians, 25,000 Estonians, and 5000 Latvians died in the ranks of the Red Army and labor battalions.

===Baltic nationals in the German forces===

The Nazi administration also conscripted Baltic nationals into the German armies. The Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force, composed of volunteers, was formed in 1944. The LTDF reached a size of roughly 10,000 men. Its goal was to fight the approaching Red Army, provide security and conduct anti-partisan operations within the territory claimed by Lithuanians. After brief engagements against Soviet and Polish partisans, the force self-disbanded. Its leaders were arrested and sent to Nazi concentration camps, and many of members were executed by the Nazis. Latvian Legion, created in 1943, consisted of two conscripted divisions of the Waffen-SS. On 1 July 1944 the Latvian Legion had 87,550 men. Another 23,000 Latvians were serving as Wehrmacht &quot;auxiliaries&quot;. Among other battles, they participated in the Siege of Leningrad, in the Courland Pocket fighting, the defence of the Pomeranian Wall, at the Velikaya River for Hill &quot;93,4&quot; and in the defence of Berlin. The 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian) was formed in January 1944 through conscription. Consisting of 38,000 men, it took part in the Battle of Narva, the Battle of Tannenberg Line, the Battle of Tartu, and Operation Aster.

===Attempts to restore independence and the Soviet offensive of 1944===
There were several attempts to restore independence during the occupation. On 22 June 1941 the Lithuanians overthrew Soviet rule two days before the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; arrived in Kaunas, where the Germans then allowed a Provisional Government to function for over a month. The Latvian Central Council was set up as an underground organisation in 1943, but it was destroyed by the &quot;Gestapo&quot; in 1945. In Estonia in 1941, Jüri Uluots proposed restoration of independence; later, by 1944, he had become a key figure in the secret National Committee. In September 1944, Uluots briefly became acting president of independent Estonia. Unlike the French and the Poles, the Baltic states had no governments in exile located in the West. Consequently, Great Britain and the United States lacked any interest in the Baltic cause while the war against Germany remained undecided. The discovery of the Katyn massacre in 1943 and callous conduct towards the Warsaw uprising in 1944 had cast shadows on relations; nevertheless, all three victors still displayed solidarity at the Yalta conference in 1945.

By 1 March 1944 the siege of Leningrad was over and Soviet troops were on the border with Estonia. The Soviets launched the Baltic Offensive, a twofold military-political operation to rout German forces, on 14 September. On 16 September the High Command of the German Army issued a plan in which Estonian forces would cover the German withdrawal. The Soviets soon reached the Estonian capital Tallinn, where the NKVD&#x27;s first mission was to stop anyone escaping from the state; however, many refugees did manage to escape to the West. The NKVD also targeted the members of the National Committee of the Republic of Estonia. German and Latvian forces remained trapped in the Courland Pocket until the end of the war, capitulating on 10 May 1945.

==Second Soviet occupation (1944–1991)==
===Resistance and deportations===
After reoccupying the Baltic states, the Soviets implemented a program of sovietization, which was achieved through large-scale industrialisation rather than by overt attacks on culture, religion or freedom of expression. The Soviets carried out massive deportations to eliminate any resistance to collectivisation or support of partisans. Baltic partisans, such as the Forest Brothers, continued to resist Soviet rule through armed struggle for a number of years.

The Soviets had previously carried out mass deportations in 1940–41, but the deportations between 1944 and 1952 were even greater. In March 1949 alone, the top Soviet authorities organised a mass deportation of 90,000 Baltic nationals.

The total number deported in 1944–55 has been estimated at over half a million: 124,000 in Estonia, 136,000 in Latvia and 245,000 in Lithuania.

The estimated death toll among Lithuanian deportees between 1945 and 1958 was 20,000, including 5,000 children.

The deportees were allowed to return after Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s secret speech in 1956 denouncing the excesses of Stalinism, however many did not survive their years of exile in Siberia. After the war, the Soviets outlined new borders for the Baltic republics. Lithuania gained the regions of Vilnius and Klaipėda while the Russian SFSR annexed territory from the eastern parts of Estonia (5% of prewar territory) and Latvia (2%).

===Industrialization and immigration===
The Soviets made investments to integrate the Baltic economies into the larger Soviet economic sphere to extract energy resources and the manufacture of industrial and agricultural products. In all three republics, manufacturing industry was developed resulting in some of the best industrial complexes in the sphere of electronics and textile production. The rural economy suffered from the lack of investments and the collectivization. Baltic urban areas had been damaged during wartime and it took ten years to recuperate housing losses. New constructions were often of poor quality and ethnic Russian immigrants were favored in housing. Estonia and Latvia received large-scale immigration of industrial workers from other parts of the Soviet Union that changed the demographics dramatically. Lithuania also received immigration but on a smaller scale.

Ethnic Estonians constituted 88 percent of the population before the war, but in 1970 the figure dropped to 60 percent. Ethnic Latvians constituted 75 percent, but the figure dropped 57 percent in 1970 and further down to 50.7 percent in 1989. In contrast, the drop in Lithuania was only 4 percent. Baltic communists had supported and participated the 1917 October Revolution in Russia. However, many of them were killed during the Great Purge in the 1930s. The new regimes of 1944 were established mostly by native communists who had fought in the Red Army. However, the Soviets also imported ethnic Russians to fill political, administrative and managerial posts.

The Baltic States were net contributors rather than beneficiaries during the illegal occupation. Detailed archival records of budget revenues and expenditures demonstrate that significantly more money was extracted from these territories than was ever invested back, even including large Soviet expenditures on its military and other repressive structures created to oppress the native population. The myth of generous Soviet “aid” in industrializing and developing the Baltics is false propaganda that conceals the substantial revenues and profits were siphoned off by the occupying Soviets.

In Latvia’s case specifically, archival evidence proves that from 1946 to 1990, the USSR drew far more resources from Latvian territory than it spent on it, with over 18% of revenues net-transferred out of the republic. The same pattern holds true for Estonia and Lithuania. This economic exploitation and heavy militarization explain why the Baltic nations, which had been relatively advanced before the war, became economically stunted compared to Western Europe, underlining the extractive nature of the Soviet occupation.

===Restorations of independence===

The period of stagnation brought the crisis of the Soviet system. The new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985 and responded with glasnost and perestroika. They were attempts to reform the Soviet system from above to avoid revolution from below. The reforms occasioned the reawakening of nationalism in the Baltic republics. The first major demonstrations against the environment were Riga in November 1986 and the following spring in Tallinn. Small successful protests encouraged key individuals and by the end of 1988 the reform wing had gained the decisive positions in the Baltic republics. At the same time, coalitions of reformists and populist forces assembled under the Popular Fronts. The Supreme Soviet of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic made the Estonian language the state language again in January 1989, and similar legislation was passed in Latvia and Lithuania soon after. The Baltic republics declared their aim for sovereignty: Estonia in November 1988, Lithuania in May 1989 and Latvia in July 1989. The Baltic Way, that took place on 23 August 1989, became the biggest manifestation of opposition to the Soviet rule. In December 1989, the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of the Soviet Union condemned the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and its secret protocol as &quot;legally untenable and invalid.&quot;
On 11 March 1990 the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet declared Lithuania&#x27;s independence. Pro-independence candidates had received an overwhelming majority in the Supreme Soviet elections held earlier that year. On 30 March 1990, seeing full restoration of independence not yet feasible due to large Soviet presence, the Estonian Supreme Soviet declared the Soviet Union an occupying power and announced the start of a transitional period to independence. On 4 May 1990, the Latvian Supreme Soviet made a similar declaration. The Soviet Union immediately condemned all three declarations as illegal, saying that they had to go through the process of secession outlined in the Soviet Constitution of 1977. However, the Baltic states argued that the entire occupation process violated both international law and their own law. Therefore, they argued, they were merely reasserting an independence that still existed under international law.

By mid-June, after unsuccessful economic blockade of Lithuania, the Soviets started negotiations with Lithuania and the other two Baltic republics. The Soviets had a bigger challenge elsewhere, as the Russian Federal Republic proclaimed sovereignty in June. Simultaneously the Baltic republics also started to negotiate directly with the Russian Federal Republic. After the failed negotiations the Soviets made a dramatic but failed attempt to break the deadlock and sent in military troops killing twenty and injuring hundreds of civilians in what became known as the &quot;Vilnius massacre&quot; in Lithuania and &quot;The Barricades&quot; in Latvia during January 1991. In August 1991, the hard-line members attempted to take control of the Soviet Union. A day after the coup on 21 August, the Estonians proclaimed full independence, after an independence referendum was held in Estonia on 3 March 1991, alongside a similar referendum in Latvia the same month. It was approved by 78.4% of voters with an 82.9% turnout. Independence was restored by the Estonian Supreme Council on the night of 20 August. The Latvian parliament made similar a declaration on the same day. The coup failed but the collapse of the Soviet Union became unavoidable. After the coup collapsed, the Soviet government recognised the independence of all three Baltic states on 6 September 1991.

===Withdrawal of Russian troops and decommissioning the radars===
The Russian Federation assumed the burden and the subsequent withdrawal of the occupation force, consisting of about 150,000 former Soviet, now Russian, troops stationed in the Baltic states. In 1992 there were still 120,000 Russian troops there, as well as a large number of military pensioners, particularly in Estonia and Latvia.

During the period of negotiations, Russia hoped to retain facilities such as the Liepāja naval base, the Skrunda anti-ballistic missile radar station, the Ventspils space-monitoring station in Latvia and the Paldiski submarine base in Estonia, as well as transit rights to Kaliningrad through Lithuania.

Contention arose when Russia threatened to keep its troops where they were. Moscow tied its concessions to specific legislation guaranteeing the civil rights of ethnic Russians, which was seen as an implied threat in the West, in the U.N. General Assembly and by Baltic leaders, who viewed it as Russian imperialism.

Lithuania was the first to see complete the withdrawal of Russian troops—on 31 August 1993—owing in part to the Kaliningrad issue.

Subsequent agreements to withdraw troops from Latvia were signed on 30 April 1994, and from Estonia on 26 July 1994. Continued linkage on the part of Russia resulted in a threat by the U.S. Senate in mid-July to halt all aid to Russia in case the forces were not withdrawn by the end of August. Final withdrawal was completed on 31 August 1994. Some Russian troops remained stationed in Estonia in Paldiski until the Russian military base was dismantled and the nuclear reactors suspended operations on 26 September 1995. Russia operated the Skrunda-1 radar station until it was decommissioned on 31 August 1998. The Russian Government then had to dismantle and remove the radar equipment; this work was completed by October 1999 when the site was returned to Latvia. The last Russian soldier left the region that month, marking a symbolic end to the Russian military presence on Baltic soil.

==Civilian toll==

During the 1940–1941 and 1944–1991 occupations 605,000 inhabitants of the three countries in total were either killed or deported (135,000 Estonians, 170,000 Latvians and 320,000 Lithuanians). Their properties and personal belonging were confiscated and given to newly arrived colonists – economic migrants, Soviet military, NKVD personnel, as well as functionaries of the Communist Party.

The estimated human costs of the occupations are presented in the table below.

== Consequences ==

The Baltic States maintain that the occupations during the war and the Soviet occupation after it had significant demographic, social and economic consequences, causing huge damage in all spheres, including the damage to the environment. All three countries suffered depopulation and repression. It is estimated that during the 1939–1945 wartime occupations alone, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania lost 25%, 30%, and 15% of their populations respectively.

The Baltic states suffered huge economic losses because of the Soviet occupation, but estimates vary due to different methodologies. In 1995, Lithuania estimated that the occupation caused more than 23 billion euros (at the prices of that time) in damage, including loss of population, destruction of property, economic collapse, and other losses. However, this methodology does not assess the losses in economic growth. Economically, Lithuania was a net donor to the USSR budget. The country suffered the most before 1958, when more than half of the annual national budgets were sent to the USSR budget; later this figure decreased, but remained high until 1973, when it was about 25% of the annual national budgets; in total, Lithuania sent about a third of all its annual national budgets to the USSR budget during the entire period of occupation. The special Latvian commission in 2016 calculated the economic damage of the occupation using a different methodology and estimated it at 185 billion euros (at the prices of that year). According to the Estonian estimates in 2005, the economic losses from the last period of the Soviet occupation alone exceed 100 billion dollars.

During the occupation period, the Baltic states suffered significant economic underdevelopment and lag compared to the other European countries. For example, in the late interwar period, Latvia&#x27;s GDP per capita in international dollars (PPP) did not differ significantly from Finland&#x27;s, but by 1965 it had already fallen to 64% of Finland&#x27;s level (Finland – $2,221, Latvia – $1,418). In 1975, this figure was 45%; in 1986, it was 50%, and in 1990, it was 45%, so by the end of the Soviet occupation, Latvia&#x27;s GDP per capita (PPP) was less than half that of Finland. Pre-war Estonia was also at a similar economic level to Finland, but experienced similar economic lag and underdevelopment during the occupation.

The Soviet Union and its successor Russia have never paid reparations to the Baltic countries.

Due to colonization and russification, the Soviet occupation also significantly changed the demographic and linguistic situation, especially in Latvia and Estonia. In 1944, Estonians made up 88–90% of the population, but according to the 1989 census, this number had decreased to 61.5%. In Latvia, between 1945 and 1955 alone, the number of immigrants reached 535,000, most of whom came from Russia. In 1940, Latvians made up about 79% of Latvia&#x27;s population, but by 1989 this number had dropped to 52%.

According to Israeli author of the Minerva Center for Human Rights at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, illegal regimes typically take measures to change the demographic structure of the territory held by the regime, usually via two methods: the forced removal of the local population and transfer their own populations into the territory. He cites the case of the Baltic states as an example of where this phenomenon has occurred, with the deportations of 1949 combined with large waves of immigration in 1945–50 and 1961–70. When the illegal regime transitioned to a lawful regime in 1991, the status of these settlers became an issue.

==Legal and historical perspectives==

The Baltic states&#x27; governments themselves, the United States and its courts of law, the European Parliament, the European Court of Human Rights and the United Nations Human Rights Council have all stated that these three countries were invaded, occupied and illegally incorporated into the Soviet Union under provisions of the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. There followed occupation by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1944 and then again occupation by the Soviet Union from 1944 to 1991. This policy of non-recognition has given rise to the principle of legal continuity of the Baltic states, which holds that &quot;de jure&quot;, or as a matter of law, the Baltic states remained independent states under illegal occupation throughout the period from 1940 to 1991. The Baltic states have repeatedly sought financial compensation from Russia for damages inflicted during the illegal occupation, both individually and collectively.

However, the Soviet Union never formally acknowledged that its presence in the Baltics was an occupation or that it had annexed these states and considered the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic and Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republics three of its constituent republics. On the other hand, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic recognized in 1991 that the events of 1940 were an &quot;annexation&quot;.

Historically revisionist Russian historiography and school textbooks continue to maintain that the Baltic states voluntarily joined the Soviet Union after their each of their peoples carried out socialist revolutions independent of Soviet influence. The post-Soviet government of Russia and its state officials insist that incorporation of the Baltic states was in accordance with international law and gained &quot;de jure&quot; recognition by the agreements made in the February 1945 Yalta and the July–August 1945 Potsdam conferences and by the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which declared the inviolability of existing frontiers. However, this claim has been described by British army think tank CHACR as both &quot;nefarious&quot; and a &quot;horrifying insult&quot; — part of an intentional propaganda campaign to spread a myth of Baltic &quot;incorporation&quot;.
Russia also agreed to Europe&#x27;s demand to &quot;assist persons deported from the occupied Baltic states&quot; upon joining the Council of Europe in 1996. Also, when the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic signed a separate treaty with Lithuania in 1991, it acknowledged the 1940 annexation as a violation of Lithuanian sovereignty and recognised the &quot;de jure&quot; continuity of the Lithuanian state.

==State continuity of the Baltic states==
The Baltic claim of continuity with the pre-war republics has been accepted by most Western powers. As a consequence of the policy of non-recognition of the Soviet seizure of these countries, combined with the resistance by the Baltic people to the Soviet regime, the uninterrupted functioning of rudimentary state organs in exile in combination with the fundamental legal principle of &quot;ex injuria jus non oritur&quot;, that no legal benefit can be derived from an illegal act, the seizure of the Baltic states was judged to be illegal thus sovereign title never passed to the Soviet Union and the Baltic states continued to exist as subjects of international law.

The official position of Russia, which chose in 1991 to be the legal and direct successor of the USSR, is that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined the Soviet Union freely and of their own accord in 1940, and, with the dissolution of the USSR, these countries became newly created entities in 1991. Russia&#x27;s stance is based upon the desire to avoid financial liability, since acknowledging the Soviet occupation would set the stage for future compensation claims from the Baltic states.

== Reparations for the illegal occupation ==
The principle of the legal continuity of the Baltic states recognized by the international community, holds that &quot;de jure&quot;, or as a matter of law, the Baltic states remained independent states under illegal occupation throughout the period from 1940 to 1991. However, during the illegal occupation, the Baltic states suffered damages valued at hundreds of billions of dollars. A report by an independent commission formed by the Latvian government in 2016 concluded that the criminal actions of the Soviet occupation had inflicted on Latvia alone constituted over €185 billion in economic damages. In 2011, a report concluded that the damage continued to incur costs to the Latvian government of €100 million a year.

The Baltic states have repeatedly sought financial reparations from Russia for damages inflicted during the illegal occupation, both individually and collectively.

In 2000, the Seimas (Lithuania&#x27;s parliament) passed a law seeking compensation from Russia for the criminal damages inflicted upon Lithuania during the illegal Soviet occupation of the Baltics. The move was endorsed by then-Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar and then-Latvian Prime Minister Andris Berzins who both supported cooperation in the Baltic Assembly on the issue.

In 2008, the Lithuanian government again stated that seeking financial compensation from Russia for the illegal Soviet occupation of Lithuania was a priority. In 2011, Lithuania continued to seek reparations with foreign minister Audronius Azubalis labeled it &quot;ridiculous to talk with Russia without resolving issues related to the occupation.&quot; On 23 May 2012, Lithuanian Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius formed a commission to move the issue forward and called for the issue of financial compensation from Russia to be included as a condition of EU-Russia relations.

==Soviet and Russian historiography==

Soviet historians saw the 1940 annexation as a voluntary entry into the USSR by the Balts. Soviet historiography promoted the interests of Russia and the USSR in the Baltic area, and it reflected the belief of most Russians that they had moral and historical rights to control and to Russianize the entire former Russian empire. To Soviet historians, the 1940 annexation was not only a voluntary entry but was also the natural thing to do. This concept taught that the military security of mother Russia was solidified and that nothing could argue against it.

===Soviet point of view===
Prior to perestroika, the Soviet Union denied the existence of the secret protocols and viewed the events of 1939–40 as follows:
*the government of the Soviet Union suggested that the governments of the Baltic countries conclude mutual assistance treaties between the countries. 
*Pressure from working people forced the governments of the Baltic countries to accept this suggestion. The pacts were then signed
*These pacts allowed the USSR to station a limited number of Red Army units in the Baltic countries.
*Economic difficulties and dissatisfaction of the populace with Baltic government policies had impeded fulfilment of the pacts, and the populace revolted against the Baltic governments&#x27; political orientation towards Germany in a revolution in June 1940. 
*To guarantee fulfilment of the pact additional military units entered the Baltic countries, welcomed by workers, who demanded the resignations of the governments. 
*In June workers demonstrated under the leadership of the Communist parties of the Baltic countries. 
*The fascist governments were overthrown, and workers&#x27; governments formed. 
*In July 1940, elections for Baltic parliaments were held. 
*The &quot;Working People&#x27;s Unions&quot;, created by the Communist parties, received the majority of the votes. 
*The parliaments adopted declarations restoring Soviet powers in Baltic countries and proclaimed the Soviet Socialist Republics. Declarations of Estonia&#x27;s, Latvia&#x27;s and Lithuania&#x27;s wishes to join the USSR were adopted and the Supreme Soviet of the USSR was petitioned accordingly.
*The requests were approved by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

The Stalin-edited &quot;Falsifiers of History&quot;, published in 1948, says the June 1940 invasions were needed because &quot;[p]acts had been concluded with the Baltic States, but there were as yet no Soviet troops there capable of holding the defences&quot;. It also states regarding those invasions that &quot;[o]nly enemies of democracy or people who had lost their senses could describe those actions of the Soviet Government as aggression&quot;.

In the reassessment of Soviet history during perestroika, the USSR condemned the 1939 secret protocol between itself and Germany that led to the invasion and occupations in the Baltic countries.

===Russian historiography in the post-Soviet era===

During the Soviet era, there was relatively little interest in the history of the Baltic states, which historians generally treated as a single entity due to the uniformity of Soviet policy in these territories.

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, two general camps have evolved in Russian historiography. One, the liberal-democratic (либерально-демократическое), condemns Stalin&#x27;s actions and the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact and does not consider the Baltic states as having joined the USSR voluntarily. The other, the national-patriotic (национально-патриотическое), contends that the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact was necessary to the security of the Soviet Union, that the Baltics&#x27; joining the USSR was the will of the proletariat—both in line with the politics of the Soviet period, &quot;the &#x27;need to ensure the security of the USSR&#x27;, &#x27;people&#x27;s revolution&#x27; and &#x27;joining voluntarily&#x27;&quot;—and that supporters of Baltic independence were the operatives of western intelligence agencies seeking to topple the USSR.

Soviet-Russian historian argues that Stalin&#x27;s ultimatums of 1940 were defensive measures taken against of the German threat and had no connection with the &#x27;socialist revolutions&#x27; in the Baltic states. The arguments that the USSR had to annex the Baltic states in order to defend the security of those countries and to avoid German invasion into the three republics can also be found in the college textbook &quot;The Modern History of Fatherland&quot;.

Sergey Chernichenko, a jurist and vice-president of the Russian Association of International Law, argues there was no declared state of war between the Baltic states and the Soviet Union in 1940, and that Soviet troops occupied the Baltic states with their agreement, and also that USSR violation of prior treaty provisions did not constitute occupation. Subsequent annexation was neither an act of aggression nor forcible and was completely legal according to international law as of 1940. Accusations of &quot;deportation&quot; of Baltic nationals by the Soviet Union are therefore baseless, he says, as individuals cannot be deported within their own country. He claims the Waffen-SS was being convicted at Nuremberg as a criminal organization and their commemoration in the &quot;openly encouraged pro-Nazi&quot; (откровенно поощряются пронацистские) Baltics as heroes seeking to liberate the Baltics from the Soviets) is an act of &quot;nationalistic blindness&quot; (националистическое ослепление). With regard to the current situation in the Baltics, Chernichenko contends the &quot;theory of occupation&quot; is the official thesis used to justify the &quot;discrimination of Russian-speaking inhabitants&quot; in Estonia and Latvia and prophesies the three Baltic governments will fail in their &quot;attempt to rewrite history&quot;.

According to the revisionist historian Oleg Platonov &quot;from the point of view of the national interests of Russia, unification was historically just, as it returned to the composition of the state ancient Russian lands, albeit partially inhabited by other peoples&quot;. The Molotov–Ribbentrop pact and protocols, including the dismemberment of Poland, merely redressed the tearing away from Russia of its historical territories by &quot;anti-Russian revolution&quot; and &quot;foreign intervention&quot;.

On the other hand, Professor and Dean of the School of International Relations and Vice-Rector of Saint Petersburg State University, Konstantin K. Khudoley views the 1940 annexation of the Baltic states as involuntary. He considers the elections were not free and fair and the decisions of the newly elected parliaments to join the Soviet Union cannot be considered legitimate as these decisions were not approved by the upper chambers of the parliaments of the respective Baltic states. He also contends that the annexation of the Baltic states had no military value in defence of possible German aggression, as it bolstered anti-Soviet public opinion in future allies Britain and the US and turned the native populations against the Soviet Union: the subsequent guerrilla movement in the Baltic states after the Second World War caused domestic problems for the Soviet Union.

===Position of the Russian Federation===
With the advent of Perestroika and its reassessment of Soviet history, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in 1989 condemned the 1939 secret protocol between Germany and the Soviet Union that had led to the division of Eastern Europe and the invasion and occupation of the three Baltic countries.

While this action did not state the Soviet presence in the Baltics was an occupation, the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic and Republic of Lithuania affirmed so in a subsequent agreement in the midst of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russia, in the preamble of its 29 July 1991, &quot;Treaty Between the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic and the Republic of Lithuania on the Basis for Relations between States&quot;, declared that once the USSR had eliminated the consequences of the 1940 annexation which violated Lithuania&#x27;s sovereignty, Lithuania–Russia relations would further improve.

However, Russia&#x27;s current official position directly contradicts its earlier rapprochement with Lithuania as well as its signature of membership to the Council of Europe, where it agreed to the obligations and commitments including &quot;iv. as regards the compensation for those persons deported from the &quot;occupied Baltic states&quot; and the descendants of deportees, as stated in Opinion No. 193 (1996), paragraph 7.xii, to settle these issues as quickly as possible...&quot;. The Russian government and state officials maintain now that the Soviet annexation of the Baltic states was legitimate and that the Soviet Union liberated the countries from the Nazis. They assert that the Soviet troops initially entered the Baltic countries in 1940 following agreements and the consent of the Baltic governments. Their position is that the USSR was not in a state of war or engaged in combat activities on the territories of the three Baltic states, therefore, the word &quot;occupation&quot; cannot be used. &quot;The assertions about [the] &#x27;occupation&#x27; by the Soviet Union and the related claims ignore all legal, historical and political realities, and are therefore utterly groundless&quot;.—&quot;Russian Foreign Ministry&quot;.

This particular Russian viewpoint is called the &quot;Myth of 1939–40&quot; by international affairs professor David Mendeloff, who states that the assertion that Soviet Union neither &quot;occupied&quot; the Baltic states in 1939 nor &quot;annexed&quot; them the following year is widely held and deeply embedded in Russian historical consciousness.

==Treaties affecting USSR–Baltic relations==
The Baltic states proclaimed independence after the signing of the Armistice, and Bolshevik Russia invaded at the end of 1918. &quot;Izvestia&quot; wrote in its 25 December 1918, issue: &quot;Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are directly on the road from Russia to Western Europe and therefore a hindrance to our revolutions... This separating wall has to be destroyed&quot;. Bolshevik Russia, however, did not gain control of the Baltic States and in 1920 concluded peace treaties with all three of them. Subsequently, at the initiative of the Soviet Union, additional non-aggression treaties were concluded with all three Baltic States:
* Peace treaties
* Non-aggression treaties
* Kellogg-Briand Pact and Litvinov&#x27;s Pact
* The Convention for the Definition of Aggression
* The Pacts of Mutual Assistance
* Treaties the USSR signed between 1940 and 1945

<doc id="462118" wikidata="Q6974810" url="?curid=462118" title="National Party of Canada">
<text>The National Party of Canada was a short-lived Canadian political party that contested the 1993 federal election. The party is not related to the earlier National Party that was founded in 1979.

==Formation==

Founded and led by Edmonton, Alberta, publisher Mel Hurtig (best known as publisher of &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;), the National Party was created in 1992 to oppose the Canada–U.S. Free Trade Agreement, an increase in continentalism, and the privatization policies of the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney. of economic nationalism, lowering the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the American to encourage exports, and social responsibility.

The National Party promoted the idea that electoral campaigns should be funded by individual Canadians each contributing a small amount each year, thus taking away what the National Party considered was the undue influence of large, multinational corporations funding political campaigns.

==1993 elections==
While the election was successful for two other new parties, the Bloc Québécois and the Reform Party, the National Party failed to win a seat.

The party nominated 171 candidates who won a total of 189,778 votes (1.40% of the popular votes, or 2.34% of the votes in those 171 ridings). None were elected, although Hurtig won 12.8% of the votes in his riding, Edmonton Northwest.

Thirteen other candidates exceeded 4%, and another 18 exceeded 3%.

During the election, the party unsuccessfully sued the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to try to force it to allow Hurtig to participate in the leaders&#x27; debates.

==Internal dissent==

After the 1993 election, Hurtig and the party&#x27;s chief financial backer, Winnipeg entrepreneur Bill Loewen, disagreed about the direction the party was taking. Hurtig and Loewen developed rival factions within the party, and battled for control.

Meanwhile, plans for internal elections continued and were carried out at the June 1994 Convention. Loewen ran a slate of candidates that he supported in an effort to regain control of the party, including Kurt Loeb as party leader and Daniel Whetung as President. Loeb, National Party candidate in 1993 in the Toronto-area riding of York Centre, reportedly sought the leadership on an interim basis, to hold a new leadership convention within about 18 months. Whetung was a relative unknown at the time. Party members were reportedly dissatisfied with the incumbent President, Andy Boyle, who was defeated by Whetung. Hurtig defeated Loeb. Loewen called for the vote to be made unanimous to demonstrate party unity.

==Dissolution==
Even with Hurtig&#x27;s decisive win in the June 1994 convention, internal divisions continued. Shortly after the convention Whetung unilaterally attempted to change the official and legal records of the Party at Elections Canada, naming himself as Party Leader and replacing recognized National Council members with self-appointed supporters. His attempt to affect a change in the membership of the National Council was rejected by Elections Canada. Hurtig resigned the leadership hoping to avoid the scandal and cost of the litigation that followed.

Loewen, a Fellow of the Certified General Accountants Association, (Loewen, removed from Party&#x27;s Board of Directors by the Ontario Court of Justice, in early 1994, was never a member of the Party&#x27;s National Council) publicly claimed to have launched several legal challenges to recover a purported $610,000 in unaccounted Party funds and assist Whetung with wresting control of the Party from its duly elected National Council. Though Loewen&#x27;s name is repeatedly found throughout the hundreds of court filings, none of the related legal proceedings included Loewen as a plaintiff (Court Records). Headed by Daniel Whetung, the seven legal actions variously included Jacques Rubacha, Shirley Demaine, Diane Ullrich, Wayne Hill, Steve Ranta, and Garry Hollingsworth. None of the seven legal actions were successful for the Plaintiffs. However the cost of defending the Party from the seven legal actions, which did not appear to originate with Loewen, bankrupted the party.

In the words of Justice Dorgan, of the British Columbia Supreme Court (Victoria Registry, File 94 4041), regarding the unaccounted funds, there was &quot;no merit in Mr. Whetung&#x27;s claims&quot;.

The claim of missing funds, highly publicized in the media, was the cornerstone of Loewen&#x27;s complaints. Those claims were pursued by Whetung. Documents, purported to be the Party&#x27;s financial statements, and provided to Daniel Whetung were filed as evidence of missing funds in the British Columbia Supreme Court. The evidence contained a large (6 digits) duplicate entry, that was not supported by any accompanying financial documentation, and misrepresented the Party&#x27;s financial position. Whetung&#x27;s legal Counsel resigned after the duplicate entry was revealed to the satisfaction of the court.

With new counsel the Whetung group called for, and offered to pay for, a forensic audit of party finances. However, the Party had already placed what financial records it had with a forensic auditor earlier that year. The auditors were unable to complete an audit, as there were too many missing records. Whetung, while stating in the Federal Court proceeding that he was unaware of any of the Party&#x27;s financial records, admitted in the BC Supreme Court to having the financial records that were needed to complete the audit. The BC Supreme Court ordered him to deliver what records he controlled to the auditors, and to pay for the audit. According to the Party&#x27;s auditors not enough of the missing records were delivered to provide an opinion. Payment for their work was never received from the Plaintiffs.

After much work by volunteers, financial records meeting the requirements set by Elections Canada were provided to the Chief Electoral Officer, prior to the de-registration of the Party.

The Whetung faction was represented by top law firms at both the provincial and federal levels. The National Council, short of funds, was represented by the Party&#x27;s President and Chief Agent, William Stephenson. Treasurer, Michael Kim Stebner, and Leader, Paul Reid. All challenges to the National Council by Whetung&#x27;s group failed from lack of merit. Costs awarded to the National Council have not been paid. The final court challenge at the Federal Court of Appeal failed on September 10, 1998 (Court file number A-1056-96). In an unprecedented move, the three member Federal Appeal Court delivered their decision from the bench in favour of the National Council, rejecting, outright, all claims by Whetung and the other plaintiffs.

Although party membership continued to grow after the 1993 election, the seven meritless court challenges having damaged the brand and the Party&#x27;s finances, the National Party of Canada was prevented from promoting the Party&#x27;s agenda or to contest any further elections. In June 1997, Canada&#x27;s Chief Electoral Officer officially de-registered the party.

Some members of the Whetung group, and one of the group&#x27;s legal counsel ran as candidates for other parties during the litigation to wrest control of the Party from the Party&#x27;s National Council and members.

<text>The Scottish Covenant Association was a non-partisan political organisation in Scotland in the 1940s and 1950s seeking to establish a devolved Scottish Assembly. It was formed by John MacCormick who had left the Scottish National Party in 1942 when they decided to support all-out independence for Scotland rather than devolution as had been their position.

MacCormick took many supporters with him, and set up the &quot;Scottish Union&quot;, which later became the &quot;Scottish Convention&quot; before eventually evolving into the Scottish Covenant Association. The name &quot;Covenant&quot; was a direct reference to the Solemn League and Covenant signed by the Scottish Covenanters of the 16th and 17th centuries. In 1950 the organisation had offices in Glasgow.

The Covenant Association played an enormous part in mobilising Scottish public opinion in favour of devolution. The Scottish Covenant &quot;was eventually signed by two million people&quot;. Ultimately though the Association&#x27;s disengagement from the conventional political process meant that this enthusiasm waned and had no outlet, with it being some 50 years before devolution was secured for Scotland.

Perhaps the greatest coup of the Covenant Association was the removal of the Stone of Destiny from Westminster Abbey by four of their members (Ian Hamilton, Kay Matheson, Gavin Vernon and Alan Stuart) over Christmas in 1950. This famous act attracted huge publicity for the cause of Scottish home rule.

<text>The Scots National League (SNL) was a political organisation which campaigned for Scottish independence in the 1920s. It amalgamated with other Scottish nationalist bodies in 1928 to form the National Party of Scotland.

The Scots National League was formed in London in 1921, out of the Highland Land League and the National Committee, by Ruaraidh Erskine of Marr and William Gillies. Eschewing the existing system of government of Scotland from Westminster, the SNL adopted an uncompromising programme for independence in preference to Home Rule. Its inspiration was the tradition of Gaelic independence and self-determination. The revolutionary socialist John Maclean chaired one of the SNL&#x27;s early meetings in Arbroath.

By 1925, and partly influenced by the abstentionist tactics of Sinn Féin, the Scots National League had decided to contest elections, hoping to induce a majority of Scottish MPs to withdraw from the Westminster Parliament to convene an independent Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. The SNL also established the &quot;Scots Independent&quot; newspaper in 1926 to further their aims.

From 1927 onwards, the SNL began to campaign for a Scottish national party. Together with its participation in the electoral process, this change made easier its liaison with the Scottish Home Rule Association, and its subsequent merger into the National Party of Scotland (NPS).

By the time of the formation of the NPS, the Scots National League had outgrown its London roots and become stronger in Scotland, largely due to the influence of Tom Gibson. Gibson had realised that nationalist politics needed to be connected to everyday issues in order to become popular. This strain of thought was prominent within the NPS and many former Scots National League members drifted from it due to their belief that the NPS was too moderate. This included Ruairidh Erskine himself, who drifted entirely from politics.

The SNL had a number of branches but its membership never exceeded 1000.

<doc id="462138" wikidata="Q178825" url="?curid=462138" title="Particle in a one-dimensional lattice">
<text>In quantum mechanics, the particle in a one-dimensional lattice is a problem that occurs in the model of a periodic crystal lattice. The potential is caused by ions in the periodic structure of the crystal creating an electromagnetic field so electrons are subject to a regular potential inside the lattice. It is a generalization of the free electron model, which assumes zero potential inside the lattice.

==Problem definition==
When talking about solid materials, the discussion is mainly around crystals – periodic lattices. Here we will discuss a 1D lattice of positive ions. Assuming the spacing between two ions is , the potential in the lattice will look something like this:

The mathematical representation of the potential is a periodic function with a period . According to Bloch&#x27;s theorem, the wavefunction solution of the Schrödinger equation when the potential is periodic, can be written as:

formula_1

where is a periodic function which satisfies . It is the Bloch factor with Floquet exponent formula_2 which gives rise to the band structure of the energy spectrum of the Schrödinger equation with a periodic potential like the Kronig–Penney potential or a cosine function as it was shown in 1928 by Strutt. The solutions can be given with the help of the Mathieu functions.

When nearing the edges of the lattice, there are problems with the boundary condition. Therefore, we can represent the ion lattice as a ring following the Born–von Karman boundary conditions. If is the length of the lattice so that , then the number of ions in the lattice is so big, that when considering one ion, its surrounding is almost linear, and the wavefunction of the electron is unchanged. So now, instead of two boundary conditions we get one circular boundary condition:
formula_3

If is the number of ions in the lattice, then we have the relation: . Replacing in the boundary condition and applying Bloch&#x27;s theorem will result in a quantization for :
formula_4
formula_5
formula_6

==Kronig–Penney model==
The Kronig–Penney model (named after Ralph Kronig and William Penney) is a simple, idealized quantum-mechanical system that consists of an infinite periodic array of rectangular potential barriers.

The potential function is approximated by a rectangular potential:
Using Bloch&#x27;s theorem, we only need to find a solution for a single period, make sure it is continuous and smooth, and to make sure the function is also continuous and smooth.

Considering a single period of the potential:&lt;br&gt;
We have two regions here. We will solve for each independently:
Let &quot;E&quot; be an energy value above the well (E&gt;0)
* For formula_7: formula_8
*For formula_9: formula_10

To find &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) in each region, we need to manipulate the electron&#x27;s wavefunction:
formula_11

And in the same manner:
formula_12

To complete the solution we need to make sure the probability function is continuous and smooth, i.e.:
formula_13

And that and are periodic:
formula_14

These conditions yield the following matrix:
formula_15

For us to have a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the matrix must be 0. This leads us to the following expression:
formula_16

To further simplify the expression, we perform the following approximations:
formula_17
formula_18
formula_19

The expression will now be:
formula_20

For energy values inside the well (&quot;E&quot; &lt; 0), we get:
formula_21
with formula_22 and formula_23.

Following the same approximations as above (formula_24), we arrive at
formula_25
with the same formula for &quot;P&quot; as in the previous case formula_26.

==Band gaps in the Kronig–Penney model==

In the previous paragraph, the only variables not determined by the parameters of the physical system are the energy &quot;E&quot; and the crystal momentum &quot;k&quot;. By picking a value for &quot;E&quot;, one can compute the right hand side, and then compute &quot;k&quot; by taking the formula_27 of both sides. Thus, the expression gives rise to the dispersion relation.

The right hand side of the last expression above can sometimes be greater than 1 or less than –1, in which case there is no value of &quot;k&quot; that can make the equation true. Since formula_28, that means there are certain values of &quot;E&quot; for which there are no eigenfunctions of the Schrödinger equation. These values constitute the band gap.

Thus, the Kronig–Penney model is one of the simplest periodic potentials to exhibit a band gap.

==Kronig–Penney model: alternative solution==
An alternative treatment to a similar problem is given. Here we have a &quot;delta&quot; periodic potential:
formula_29

 is some constant, and is the lattice constant (the spacing between each site). Since this potential is periodic, we could expand it as a Fourier series:
formula_30
where
formula_31

The wave-function, using Bloch&#x27;s theorem, is equal to formula_32 where formula_33 is a function that is periodic in the lattice, which means that we can expand it as a Fourier series as well:
formula_34

Thus the wave function is:
formula_35

Putting this into the Schrödinger equation, we get:
formula_36
or rather:
formula_37

Now we recognize that:
formula_38

Plug this into the Schrödinger equation:
formula_39

Solving this for formula_40 we get:
formula_41

We sum this last equation over all values of to arrive at:
formula_42

Or:
formula_43

Conveniently, formula_44 cancels out and we get:
formula_45

Or:
formula_46

To save ourselves some unnecessary notational effort we define a new variable:
formula_47
and finally our expression is:
formula_48

Now, is a reciprocal lattice vector, which means that a sum over is actually a sum over integer multiples of formula_49:
formula_50

We can juggle this expression a little bit to make it more suggestive (use partial fraction decomposition):
formula_51

If we use a nice identity of a sum of the cotangent function (Equation 18) which says:
formula_52
and plug it into our expression we get to:
formula_53

We use the sum of and then, the product of (which is part of the formula for the sum of ) to arrive at:
formula_54

This equation shows the relation between the energy (through ) and the wave-vector, , and as you can see, since the left hand side of the equation can only range from to then there are some limits on the values that (and thus, the energy) can take, that is, at some ranges of values of the energy, there is no solution according to these equation, and thus, the system will not have those energies: energy gaps. These are the so-called band-gaps, which can be shown to exist in &quot;any&quot; shape of periodic potential (not just delta or square barriers).

For a different and detailed calculation of the gap formula (i.e. for the gap between bands) and the level splitting of eigenvalues of the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation see Müller-Kirsten. Corresponding results for the cosine potential (Mathieu equation) are also given in detail in this reference.

==Finite lattice==

In some cases, the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically on a one-dimensional lattice of finite length using the theory of periodic differential equations. The length of the lattice is assumed to be formula_55, where formula_56 is the potential period and the number of periods formula_57 is a positive integer. The two ends of the lattice are at formula_58 and formula_59, where formula_58 determines the point of termination. The wavefunction vanishes outside the interval formula_61.

The eigenstates of the finite system can be found in terms of the Bloch states of an infinite system with the same periodic potential. If there is a band gap between two consecutive energy bands of the infinite system, there is a sharp distinction between two types of states in the finite lattice. For each energy band of the infinite system, there are formula_62 bulk states whose energies depend on the length formula_57 but not on the termination formula_58. These states are standing waves constructed as a superposition of two Bloch states with momenta formula_65 and formula_66, where formula_65 is chosen so that the wavefunction vanishes at the boundaries. The energies of these states match the energy bands of the infinite system.

For each band gap, there is one additional state. The energies of these states depend on the point of termination formula_68 but not on the length formula_57. The energy of such a state can lie either at the band edge or within the band gap. If the energy is within the band gap, the state is a surface state localized at one end of the lattice, but if the energy is at the band edge, the state is delocalized across the lattice.

<text>The Scots Independent is a monthly Scottish political newspaper that is in favour of Scottish independence. It was formed in 1926 with William Gillies as editor, by the Scots National League (SNL) and switched its allegiance to the National Party of Scotland (NPS) when the SNL joined with them in 1928.

When the NPS merged with the Scottish Party in 1934 to form the Scottish National Party (SNP) they switched to supporting them. The paper is still today largely pro-SNP.

Editors of the paper have included Arthur Donaldson, Robert McIntyre, Tom H. Gibson, John L. Kinloch, Alastair Macdonald, Michael Grieve, Albert D. Mackie, David Murison, Douglas Stewart, Alwyn James, Colin Bell, W. Kenneth Fee and James and Jennifer Taggart.

<doc id="462141" wikidata="Q388974" url="?curid=462141" title="Michel Théato">
<text>Michel Johann Théato (22 March 1878 – 2 April 1923) was a Luxembourgish born French long-distance runner, and the winner of the marathon at the 1900 Olympics in Paris running for France. He was born in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg and died in Paris, France.

==Early life==
Little is known about Théato&#x27;s early life. For many years it was believed he was a baker&#x27;s delivery boy in Paris. He also worked for some time as a cabinetmaker. In the 20th century, Alain Bouillé discovered that Théato was born in Luxembourg and had moved to Belgium before settling down in the Paris suburbs. There is no evidence that Théato ever applied for French citizenship. Théato was a member of the athletics club in Saint-Mandé in Paris.

==1900 Olympics==
The marathon started at 2:30pm in blazing heat. There were only 13 starters of the race, of whom 6 finished. Théato won the race with a time of 2:59:45 with 4 min 32 s ahead of Émile Champion and 37 min 39 s over Sweden&#x27;s Ernst Fast under the eyes of more than 5,000 spectators.

Théato&#x27;s victory was initially disputed, as several of his opponents, including American runner Arthur Newton, who finished fifth, alleged that Théato had cheated by taking multiple shortcuts, helped by his local knowledge of the Parisian streets through his job as a delivery boy. These allegations have since been disproved.

The first three finishers only receive as rewards after the race porcelain pottery, of no real value, provided by an ungenerous industrialist; these were commented on at the time as being “objects of horror” or even “hardware”.

Olympic gold, silver and bronze medals were not introduced until the following Olympiad in Saint-Louis in 1904, and the winners of the 1900 marathon did not receive their medals retroactively until 1912, without ceremony.

== Sports nationality ==
The athletics statistician Alain Bouillé revealed at the end of the 20th century that Théato was not yet French at the time of the Games. Born in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, he arrived in France at the age of 12. He should have done his military service at the time of the Games if he had obtained his naturalization before 1900. Luxembourg never claimed this title and the IOC confirmed the “French” victory after Bouillé&#x27;s work. The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg lodged an official complaint with the International Olympic Committee and petitioned to change the Olympic record of Théato&#x27;s nationality; the complaint was officially rejected in 2004. In 2021, the IOC site mistakenly displayed the Luxembourg flag on Michel Théato&#x27;s page, which led some to believe that Luxembourg had officially recovered this Olympic title. It was actually a technical error in the IOC database, error since corrected, between nationality and NOC represented by the athlete.

==Later life==
Théato later became a professional runner, although with relatively little success. He set a personal best in the marathon of 2:42 in 1901.

<text>Daniel Craig McCallum (January 21, 1815 – December 27, 1878) was a Scottish-born American railroad engineer, general manager of the New York and Erie Railroad and Union Brevet Major General of the United States Military Railroads during the American Civil War, known as one of the early pioneers of management. He set down a group of general principles of management, and is credited for having developed the first modern organizational chart.

== Early life and education ==
McCallum was born in Johnstone in the council area of Renfrewshire in the west-central Lowlands of Scotland in 1815. In 1822, while he was still a boy, his family emigrated to Rochester, New York. He did attend elementary school but did not want to follow his father&#x27;s footsteps and become a tailor. Instead, McCallum left school to become a carpenter and worked his way up.

== New York engineer ==
In the early 1840s, McCallum worked as a civil engineer in Rochester, designing buildings including Saint Joseph&#x27;s Church. Soon he started building and maintaining railway bridges as subcontractor for the New York and Erie Railroad. By the late 1840s, the New York and Erie Railroad placed McCallum in charge of its bridges, and he started experimenting with new construction methods. He developed and in 1851 patented a new type of bridge, named the &quot;McCallum Inflexible Arched Truss Bridge&quot;, which could withstand heavier loads and required less maintenance than previous designs. One such at Lanesboro, Pennsylvania over the Susquehanna River, drew national attention for its durable construction.

In the early 1850s, the New York and Erie Railroad promoted McCallum to the superintendent of the Susquehanna Division, one of the railroad&#x27;s five operating divisions. About two years later (1854/54) he received another promotion, becoming the railroad&#x27;s General Superintendent and succeeding Charles Minot during Homer Ramsdell&#x27;s presidency. In this position, McCallum supervised the entire railroad, as well as restructured it to make it more efficient and safe. New management and communication methods used the telegraph. McCallum also described these new management principles and introduced the first modern organizational chart. On February 25, 1857, 

In 1858, McCallum resigned from the Erie Railroad and founded the McCallum Bridge Company.

== U.S. military railroads ==

On February 11, 1862, weeks after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Railways and Telegraph Act of January 31, 1862 (which authorized the president to seize and operate any railroad or telegraph company&#x27;s equipment for use during the American Civil War), the new secretary of war Edwin M. Stanton appointed McCallum as military director and superintendent of the United States Military Railroad with the staff rank of colonel. The USMRR&#x27;s primary mission was to repair and operate captured Southern lines to support the Union army. 

The previous secretary of war, Simon Cameron, had called on the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Vice President Thomas A. Scott to coordinate railroads and Scott had been promoted to Assistant Secretary of War. However, President Lincoln replaced Cameron in January after newspapers reported he unduly favored the North Central Railroad in which he was a stockholder, at the expense of rival railroads including the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, including allowing removed B&amp;O track and telegraph wire to be shipped to repair damaged Virginia lines. On April 22, 1862, Stanton summoned West Point graduate Herman Haupt, who had become a leading railway engineer after resigning his U.S. Army commission and who had applied for Scott&#x27;s job, to evaluate the engineering required to rebuild the Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac line in Virginia. On May 28 Haupt was also appointed a colonel, but he twice refused military rank (including a promotion to brigadier general on September 5, 1862), instead of becoming the civilian Chief of Construction and Transportation in the Department of the Rappahannock. Although Haupt would have difficulties dealing with some military men, he worked well with McCallum.

McCallum remained in Washington during the war to oversee the &quot;big picture&quot; of USMRR operations, and especially coordinate deliveries of locomotives and other equipment with manufacturers. He received a brevet promotion to brigadier-general of volunteers for faithful and meritorious services on September 24, 1864, and his authority was extended to the Western Theater and to support Sherman&#x27;s Atlanta Campaign. He received another promotion to major general in 1865. In July 1866 McCallum was mustered out of the service and published a report on the military railroads during the war.

MacCallum also wrote a set of poems. The most famous was called &#x27;Lights on the Bridge&#x27;, which he wrote shortly before his death, memorializing his friend, Sam Campbell, a railroad engineer killed in 1842. McCallum himself died in Brooklyn, New York, on December 27, 1878.

== Work ==

=== Architecture, 1830s-40s ===

McCallum was an architect in Rochester from 1840, and for a few subsequent years. He was an accomplished architect and held a high position in his profession. Among the prominent buildings erected by him are the House of Refuge, St. Josephs Church, St. Marys Hospital, and the Odd-Fellows&#x27; Hall building. He did much to improve the general architecture of the city. His drawings and studies were carefully made, and his plans well-adapted to location.

The St. Josephs Church was originally built 1843–1846 in the simple monumental tradition of the Greek Revival, with a gray stone facade of series of arched bays on the exterior facade. The simple church was enlarged 1849 into a cruciform plan that sat a thousand. The interior was remodeled in 1895. The first steeple was added in 1859 and replaced with a tower in 1909, designed by Joseph Oberlies. Nowadays only the preserved facade of St. Joseph&#x27;s Church has remained.

=== McCallum&#x27;s inflexible arched truss bridge, 1840s–60s ===
Late 1840s McCallum developed a specific truss bridge construction for the railroad bridges, called McCallum inflexible arched truss. It was constructed principally of pine timber, with less than the ordinary portion of iron rods, blots and casings. An editorial notice from Appletons&#x27; &quot;Mechanics&#x27; Magazine&quot;, edited by Julius W. Adams commented on McCallum&#x27;s patent timber bridge, built-in 1851 over the Susquehanna River, near Lanesboro&#x27;, Pennsylvania, for the New York and Erie railroad:

These inflexible arched trusses were used in wooden railroad bridges across the US and Canada in the 19th century. After his work at the New York and Erie Railroad, in 1858 McCallum founded the McCallum Bridge Company in Cincinnati. The company specialized in railroad bridges, which they build in the Western and Southern States. Some of the Howe truss men were so impressed by McCallum&#x27;s business success (if not by his arguments) that they began arching their top chords, and a notable example of this practice was the Rock Island Bridge over the Mississippi River. The advent of steel bridges in the 1860s effectively made obsolete his unique design.

=== Large-scale management problems at New York &amp; Erie Railroad, 1850s ===

McCallum had started at the New York &amp; Erie Railroad as a subcontractor to build and maintain bridges, was appointed superintendent of one region, and eventually made its general superintendent in 1855, controlling over 5000 employees. In this position McCallum came in contact with the large-scale management problems, which other great railroad companies such as the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad also faced. One of the main problems of these largest railroad companies was the rising of costs of moving freight in comparison to smaller companies. McCallum postulated that this was caused by the inefficient internal organization. In his 1856 report to the stockholders of the New York &amp; Erie Railroad he explained:

New methods had to be invented for mobilizing, controlling, and apportioning capital, for operating a widely dispersed system, and for supervising thousands of specialized workmen spread over hundreds of miles. The railroads solved all these problems and became the model for all large businesses. The main innovators were three engineers, Benjamin H. Latrobe of the Baltimore and Ohio, McCallum of the Erie, and John Edgar Thomson of the Pennsylvania (railroad). They devised the functional departments and first defined the lines of authority, responsibility, and communication with the concomitant separation of line and staff duties which have remained the principles of the modern American corporation.

=== Illustrative organization chart, 1855 ===

As general superintendent McCallum in 1855 designed an illustrative organization chart of the New York and Erie Railway, which is considered to be the first modern organization chart, which was compiled and drawn by the civil engineer George Holt Henshaw. On the chart is written, that the diagram represents a plan of organization, and exhibits the division of administrative duties and shows the number and class of employees engaged in each department, and is dated September 1855.

The chart explains that the diagram is compiled from the latest monthly report and indicates the average number of employees of each class engaged in the Operating Department of the railroad company. It shows the powers and duties of each individual and to whom they are subject to report. It further describes:

:&quot;By inspection it will be seen that the Board of Directors as the fountain of power, concentrates their authority in the President as the Executive Officer, who in that capacity directly controls those officers who are shown on the Diagram at the termini of the lines diverging from him, and these in their turn, through all the various ramifications down to the lowest employee control those who terminate the lines from them.&lt;br&gt;All orders from the Superior officers are communicated in the above order, from superior to subordinate to the point of desired; thereby securing despatch in their execution and maintaining proper discipline without weakening the authority of the immediate superior of the subordinate controlled by the order thus transmitted. Each individual, therefore, holds himself responsible only to his immediate superior...&quot;&quot;&quot;

Furthermore, a table is added showing the number of offices and employees classed. First were listed the employees in the five divisions of the New York &amp; Erie Railroad divided into workers at the station, on trains, on repairs of trucks, and on repairs of bridges and buildings.

The chart was thought lost for years and only located at the Library of Congress after many years of research after Alfred Chandler had suggested its existence. It was found by Charles D. Wrege (1924–2014) and Guidon Sorbo Jr. (1927–2008) in 2005. They suggested that the visualization of the organizational tree probably was inspired by the shape of a local flower Salix caprea (goat willow, also known as the pussy willow, or great sallow).

=== Principles of management, 1856 ===
As General Superintendent of the New York and Erie Railroad, McCallum developed new ideas about a modern system of management. In his 1856 report he formulated the following requirements: 
:&quot;A system of operations to be efficient and successful should be such as to give to the principal and responsible head of the running department a complete daily history of details in all their minutiae. Without such supervision, the procurement of a satisfactory annual statement must be regarded as extremely problematic. The fact that dividends are made without such control does not disprove the position, as in many cases the extraordinarily remunerative nature of an enterprise may ensure satisfactory returns under the most loose and inefficient management...&quot;
McCallum presented the following general principles for the formation of such an efficient system of operations, reprinted in Vose (1857) 
:*First. A proper division of responsibilities.
:*Second. Sufficient power conferred to enable the same to be fully carried out, that such responsibilities may be real in their character.
:*Third. The means of knowing whether such responsibilities are faithfully executed.
:*Fourth. Great promptness in the report of all derelictions of duty, that evils may at once be corrected.
:*Fifth. Such information to be obtained through a system of daily reports and checks that will not embarrass principal officers nor lessen their influence with their subordinates.
:*Sixth. The adoption of a system, as a whole, which will not only enable the general superintendent to detect errors immediately, but will also point out the delinquent.

About the core principle of management, he summarized: 

Vose (1857, p. 416) added, that all subordinates should be accountable to, and directed by, their immediate superiors only. Each officer must have authority, with the approval of the general superintendent, to appoint all persons for whose acts he is held responsible, and to dismiss any subordinate when in his judgment the interests of the company demand it.

=== American Civil War, 1862–65 ===

On 11 February 1862, McCallum was appointed military director and superintendent of the Union railroads, with the staff rank of colonel, by Edwin M. Stanton, the Secretary of War. McCallum had the authority to &quot;enter upon, take possession of, hold and use all railroads, engines, cars, locomotives, and equipment that may be required for the transport of troops, arms, ammunition, and military supplies of the United States, and to do and perform all acts... that may be necessary and proper... for the safe and speedy transport aforesaid,&quot; he wrote in his 1866 report. McCallum&#x27;s view was that his organization &quot;was a great construction and transportation machine, for carrying out the objects of the commanding generals.&quot; As superintendent of the New York and Erie Railroad McCallum had developed a reputation as an autocratic leader, running his railroad with &quot;strict precision and stern discipline.&quot; But to his credit, he combined his engineering and administrative talents with his pleasant personality to make a success of his tenure.
As McCallum&#x27;s assistant was appointed Herman Haupt, who also was called to service in early 1862. The two worked practically independent from each other. While McCallum was the administrative head of the U.S. Military Railroads, Herman Haupt was in charge of the operations of the railroad in the field. At the time that McCallum assumed his duties, the seven-mile road from Washington to Alexandria, Virginia, was the only railroad in federal government control. By May 1862 the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, which ran from Alexandria southwest toward Orange, Virginia, was an important supply line, as was the Manassas Gap Railroad, which covered the territory between Manassas Junction and Front Royal and Strasburg. By the end of the war, the U.S. Military Railroads had, at different times during the war, used parts of 17 railroads as military lines in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania and 23 in Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, Arkansas, and North Carolina. In addition, the small Construction Corps grew from about 300 men in 1863 to nearly 10,000 men by the end of the war.

During his stint as superintendent of the U.S. Military Railroads, McCallum fulfilled the function of liaison officer between the government and the many railroads on the one hand, and manufacturers of railroad equipment on the other. His greatest success was supporting the western operations from Nashville and Chattanooga under Gen. William T. Sherman in the summer of 1864, by successfully supplying General Sherman&#x27;s army of 100,000 men and 60,000 animals.&quot; &quot;The successful supply of Sherman&#x27;s army in its campaign from Chattanooga to Atlanta was the most outstanding achievement of the military railroads,&quot; later reported Thomas Weber in &quot;The Northern Railroads in the Civil War, 1861–1865&quot;.

In 1865 McCallum participated in the organization of the Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln. Following his death by assassination, the body of Abraham Lincoln was brought from Washington, D.C. to its final resting place in Lincoln&#x27;s hometown of Springfield, Illinois, by funeral train, accompanied by dignitaries. The Department of War designated the route and declared railroads over which the remains passed as military roads under the control of McCallum as director and superintendent of United States Military Railroads. No person was allowed to be transported on the cars except those authorized by the War Department, and the train never moved at speeds of more than an hour to avoid any accidents.

To McCallum was due much of the efficiency of the railroad service during the civil war. He was brevetted brigadier-general of volunteers &quot;for faithful and meritorious services,&quot; September 24, 1864, and Major General, March 13, 1865. On July 31, 1866, he was mustered out of the service. In the same year, he published a report on the military railroads during the war, written with James Barnet Fry.

== Reception ==

=== American timber bridges ===
The 1863 article entitled &quot;American Timber Bridges&quot; by the Institution of Civil Engineers described that:
The National Cyclopedia of American Biography (1897) confirmed, that the inflexible arched truss introduced by McCallum has probably been in more general use in the United States than any other system of timber bridges. A 2012 Historic American Engineering Record confirms that:

This success didn&#x27;t last much longer. McCallum continued to construct bridges during the Civil War, but the type of bridge fell out of favor. It was obsolete by 1870, because it was difficult to frame and metal constructions had taken over.

Nowadays the only remaining example in the world of the McCallum truss is the Percy Covered Bridge (1861), ironically an automobile and footbridge. It crosses the Châteauguay River at Powerscourt, Québec, between the municipalities of Elgin and Hinchinbrooke.

=== Management principles ===
Chandler (1977) stipulated that:
McCallum&#x27;s work drew national and international attention. Chandler (1977) recalled that 
McCallum&#x27;s ideas were further developed by others, such as Chandler (1956) explained: &quot;expert railroad engineers as George Vose and John B. Jervis wrote much on the principles of systematic management which McCallum had first articulated and Poor had expanded upon.&quot;

==Plot==
Togenkyo (Shangri-La) is a peaceful world, a land where after terrible battles between humans and Yokai (demons), peace and harmony reigned for 500 years. But now, someone is trying to bring the demon king Gyumao back to life generating waves of evil energy which flow throughout the territory, driving the Yokai crazy and awakening within them dark instincts that drive them to massacre humans. The Buddhist Trinity then urgently dispatches one of the five Sanzo, the sacred guardians of the five creative sutras of the world. Genjo Sanzo, the complete opposite of the image expected of such a high-ranking bronze, is entrusted with the mission of going to the west of Togenkyo in order to stop the resurrection of evil god named Gyumao. For this he will be accompanied by his faithful companion Son Goku, a 15-year-old child who looks like a little monkey and spends his time eating, Sha Gojyo, a great flirt and drinker before the eternal, and Cho Hakkai, always smiling and friendly but hiding a heavy past, the only ones who have not been affected a priori by this curse which affects the yokais. Along the way they will encounter many adversaries and face just as many journeys. Meanwhile, the black waves continue to spread. Sanzo, Goku, Gojyo and Hakkai during a short stopover in a village meet the beautiful Shunrei whose lover was a yokai. This forbidden romance came to a tragic end when the young yokai transformed into a monster. We also discover that Gojyo is looking for his half-brother, Jien, who disappeared after committing a crime to save him. Shortly after, while Sanzo and his gang are taking a well-deserved rest in a restaurant-bar, they are attacked by Yaone, the herbalist from Kogaiji, the son of the terrible bull demon Gyumao, who intervenes to save her. Four heroes are impressed by his power and charisma.

A little further down the road, they discover a mountain of yokai corpses. It seems that the person responsible for this carnage is a monk nicknamed “the savior”. But in truth, the monk Rikudo, with his mutilated face and body covered with incantatory seals, is none other than Shuei, a specialist in incantations that Sanzo knew during his childhood... Sanzo&#x27;s former friend turns out to be possessed by an evil incantatory seal. While he confronts Sanzo&#x27;s gang with the intention of killing the gang&#x27;s youkais, that is to say Goku, Hakkai and Gojyo, he pierces Sanzo with his Buddhist stick while the latter had interposed himself between Rikudo and Goku to save the boy. The minutes pass, interminable, and only the sound of falling rain resonates. When he sees his dying friend, Goku goes berserk and his yokai power controller breaks. His former power then released, Goku becomes violent and begins to destroy everything in his path. Meanwhile, at Hojo Castle, Lady Gyokumen, Gyumao&#x27;s mistress who is trying by all means to resurrect him, is getting impatient: she wants the death of Sanzo and his gang. Ririn, Kogaiji&#x27;s half-sister, decides to take on the challenge alone, but that&#x27;s without counting on a new and mysterious enemy who seems to have a score to settle with Hakkai. As Genjyo Sanzo, Sha Gojyo, Cho Hakkai and Son Goku continue their pilgrimage west, they encounter a mysterious fortune teller, Chin Yi-So. This one is in fact a youkai who has the ability to summon Shikigami (creature summoned by such and such to serve him) and will not deprive himself of it to attack our friends. However, the youkai has a fierce hatred towards Cho Hakkai, whom he calls by his old first name, Cho Gono. To defeat him, he will have to face his most terrifying ghosts. Flashback to the meeting of the four outlaws on a mission to save the world!
On a full moon night, Sha Gojyo finds a half-dead man in the middle of the path... And while the Buddhist Trinity sends Genjo Sanzo on the trail of a human who has become a youkai, Sanzo, accompanied by Goku, sets out on the trace of Cho Gono... The tortuous thread of destiny inexorably guides the four friends... Cho Gono committed a terrible crime in the name of revenge. Tortured by remorse, he seeks the answer to his questions. During their journey, Sanzo and his gang infiltrate the lair of a desert youkai believed to have stolen one of the sutras of the opening of Heaven and Earth. But during their fight, Sanzo collapses, struck down by the yokai&#x27;s deadly fish.

Sanzo, poisoned by the venom of a yokai, oscillates between life and death. The sandcastle in which our four heroes were imprisoned begins to collapse in a shattering tumult. Fortunately, the Sanzo gang is saved at the last minute by Kogaiji. But he challenges Goku to a duel in order to recover the sacred sutra. Goku hesitates but his emotions, his desire not to lose a loved one, push him to make a terrible decision: he takes off his golden crown himself! But after Goku defeats Kogaiji, while Gojyo and Hakkai are really struggling to stop Goku&#x27;s murderous madness, a gunshot rings out, Shortly after this terrible ordeal, the gang rested in a neighboring town. While out doing some shopping, Gojyo saves a little boy who is being mistreated by a group of thugs. Without knowing that his act will cause a new drama... Impossible but yet terribly real: Goku and Hakkai have fallen, defeated! Prisoners of the dimension contained in the jar of the young demon Kinkaku, they will have to demonstrate tenacity against the dark entities who hunt there, and in particular Kinkaku&#x27;s own twin, Ginkaku. For their part, Sanzo and Gojyo will both have to learn to team up to help their friends, even if it means supporting each other for an indefinite period... Faced with the sad fate reserved for the twins Kinkaku and Ginkaku, Gojyo loses his cool and sets out alone in the footsteps of the one who calls himself &quot;God&quot;. Whoever he may be, he is undoubtedly the most formidable adversary the gang has encountered so far, and our heroes already find themselves trapped in his hands, in a deadly game where the rules mean nothing. and where the disproportionate power of the enemy leaves no chance... The unthinkable has happened: defeated, injured and humiliated, the members of Sanzo&#x27;s gang leave the domain of &quot;God&quot;. The defeat rekindles tensions within the fine team, and it seems that this time their tenacity is undermined... The Sanzo Party are determined to take back the sutra stolen by God and take revenge for the humiliation he inflicted on them.
