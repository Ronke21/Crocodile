<text>The University of Florence (Italian: &quot;Università degli Studi di Firenze&quot;) (in acronym UNIFI) is an Italian public research university located in Florence, Italy. It comprises 12 schools and has around 50,000 students enrolled.

==History==
The first university in Florence was the which was established by the Florentine Republic in 1321. The Studium was recognized by Pope Clement VI in 1349, and authorized to grant regular degrees. The Pope also established that the first Italian faculty of theology would be in Florence. The Studium became an imperial university in 1364, but was moved to Pisa in 1473 when Lorenzo the Magnificent gained control of Florence. Charles VIII moved it back from 1497 to 1515, but it was moved to Pisa again when the Medici family returned to power.

The modern university dates from 1859, when a group of disparate higher-studies institutions grouped together in the Istituto di Studi Pratici e di Perfezionamento, which a year later was recognized as a full-fledged university by the government of newly unified Italy. In 1923, the Istituto was officially denominated as University by the Italian Parliament.

==Organization==
The university is subdivided into 12 schools, which are: Agriculture; Architecture; Arts; Economics; Education; Engineering; Law; Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences; Medicine and Surgery; Pharmacology; Political Science; and Psychology.

Faculties are located in traditionally strategic areas based on their subject matter. The Faculty of Economics, Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Political Sciences are in the Polo delle Scienze Sociali (campus of social sciences), in the Novoli district, near the new courthouse. The Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, the Faculty of Pharmacology, and certain scientific and engineering departments are in the Careggi district, close to the hospital. The Faculty of Engineering is located at the S. Marta Institute, whereas the Faculty of Agriculture is in front of the Parco delle Cascine. The Faculty of Mathematical, Physical and Natural Sciences is located in Sesto Fiorentino. The Faculty of Architecture is in the center of the city, as the Accademia di Belle Arti, home of Michelangelo&#x27;s David. The Faculties of Literature, History, Philosophy, and Pedagogy are in the centre of Florence.

== School of Law ==
The University hosts one of the leading Italian law schools, repeatedly recognised as a national &quot;Department of Excellence&quot; by the Italian Ministry of Education, University, and Research. Alumni and faculty members of the University of Florence School of Law have held leading positions in government. They include Presidents of the Italian Constitutional Court Silvana Sciarra, Paolo Grossi, Ugo de Siervo, and Enzo Cheli, President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Jugoslavia and Special Tribunal for Lebanon Antonio Cassese, Judge of the International Court of Justice Giorgio Gaja, Judge of the Court of Justice of the European Union Roberto Mastroianni, former Prime Ministers of the Italian Republic Matteo Renzi and Giuseppe Conte, and members of the Constituent Assembly Piero Calamandrei and Giorgio La Pira.

<doc id="453755" wikidata="Q1148215" url="?curid=453755" title="Mitchell's embedding theorem">
<text>Mitchell&#x27;s embedding theorem, also known as the Freyd–Mitchell theorem or the full embedding theorem, is a result about abelian categories; it essentially states that these categories, while rather abstractly defined, are in fact concrete categories of modules. This allows one to use element-wise diagram chasing proofs in these categories. The theorem is named after Barry Mitchell and Peter Freyd.

==Details==
The precise statement is as follows: if A is a small abelian category, then there exists a ring &quot;R&quot; (with 1, not necessarily commutative) and a full, faithful and exact functor &quot;F&quot;: A → &quot;R&quot;-Mod (where the latter denotes the category of all left &quot;R&quot;-modules).

The functor &quot;F&quot; yields an equivalence between A and a full subcategory of &quot;R&quot;-Mod in such a way that kernels and cokernels computed in A correspond to the ordinary kernels and cokernels computed in &quot;R&quot;-Mod. Such an equivalence is necessarily additive.
The theorem thus essentially says that the objects of A can be thought of as &quot;R&quot;-modules, and the morphisms as &quot;R&quot;-linear maps, with kernels, cokernels, exact sequences and sums of morphisms being determined as in the case of modules. However, projective and injective objects in A do not necessarily correspond to projective and injective &quot;R&quot;-modules.

== Sketch of the proof ==
Let formula_1 be the category of left exact functors from the abelian category formula_2 to the category of abelian groups formula_3. First we construct a contravariant embedding formula_4 by formula_5 for all formula_6, where formula_7 is the covariant hom-functor, formula_8. The Yoneda Lemma states that formula_9 is fully faithful and we also get the left exactness of formula_9 very easily because formula_7 is already left exact. The proof of the right exactness of formula_9 is harder and can be read in Swan, &quot;Lecture Notes in Mathematics 76&quot;.

After that we prove that formula_13 is an abelian category by using localization theory (also Swan). This is the hard part of the proof.

It is easy to check that the abelian category formula_13 is an AB5 category with a generator 
formula_15.
In other words it is a Grothendieck category and therefore has an injective cogenerator formula_16.

The endomorphism ring formula_17 is the ring we need for the category of &quot;R&quot;-modules.

By formula_18 we get another contravariant, exact and fully faithful embedding formula_19 The composition formula_20 is the desired covariant exact and fully faithful embedding.

Note that the proof of the Gabriel–Quillen embedding theorem for exact categories is almost identical.

<text>The University of Trieste (, or UniTS, Formerly Regia Università degli Studi or The Royal University of Studies) is a public research university in Trieste in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region in northeast Italy. The university consists of 10 departments, has a wide and almost complete range of university courses and has about 15,000 students and 1,000 professors. It was founded in 1924.

The historical international vocation of the University of Trieste is witnessed by its intense and high-level research activity: Trieste is the centre of many research facilities, with which the university is connected by cooperation agreements. Among them, there are the International School for Advanced Studies, the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, the National Institute of Oceanography, the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, the Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste Facility, the Trieste sections of the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) and Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), and many others, building up the so-called &quot;sistema Trieste&quot; (Trieste System).

Moreover, the number of international inter-university co-operation agreements rapidly increased these last years. These agreements involve staff and student mobility, both within EU Programmes like the Socrates programme and agreements exclusively concerned with research activities.

==History==

Before World War I, when Trieste was still a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Italian-speaking population strongly supported the idea of building a university in the town, but Austrian authorities repeatedly rejected the proposal. After the annexation of Trieste to Italy, the already existing &quot;Superior School in Commerce&quot; was granted the same rights of similar schools in Italy, and in 1924 it was turned into a university, by king&#x27;s decree (8 August 1924, n. 1338). In 1938, with the institution of the Law faculty, the second after the Economy and Commerce faculty, the university became a &quot;Studium Generale&quot; (General Studies) one, and thus was given the title of &quot;Regia Università degli Studi&quot; (The Royal University of Studies). In the same year, the construction of a new building to house the faculties began on the Scoglietto hill, in a position dominating the Old City. The building, which still hosts the directive board and some faculties, was designed by architects Raffaello Fagnoni and Umberto Nordio. The first stone was posed in a ceremony on 19 September 1938 in the presence of the Italian Prime Minister and other authorities.

World War II slowed down the planned enlargement of the university. Indeed, the faculty of Engineering, although established in 1942, was restricted to naval engineering until the end of the war, while the opening of the faculty of Literature and philosophy, planned in 1943, was postponed till 1945. After the world war, Trieste was put under the joint control of the United Kingdom and the United States of America, in preparation for the establishment of a fully independent State, the Free Territory of Trieste, which nevertheless never came to exist. The Allied Government allowed the foundation of the new Literature and Philosophy faculty, instituted the faculty of Mathematical, Physical and Natural Sciences, and completed the construction of the main building on the Scoglietto hill, inviting an emissary of the Italian government to the inauguration ceremony.

In 1954 Trieste was given back to Italy thanks to an agreement between the American and the Italian governments. To celebrate, the university awarded the President of the Italian Republic Luigi Einaudi a &quot;honoris causa&quot; degree in Economy and Commerce. In a short time new faculties were added (Pharmacy, Teaching Sciences, Medicine and Surgery, Political Sciences), while also new buildings were inaugurated on the Scoglietto hill and in other parts of the town. In 1978 the &quot;School of Modern Languages for Interpreters and Translators&quot; was given the status of faculty; in 1997 the faculty of Psychology and in 1998 the faculty of Architecture completed the range of faculties currently present at the university.

==Organization==

These are the 10 departments into which the university is divided on the basis of the major reorganisation of the university&#x27;s academic structure which took place in 2010:

* Clinical Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences
* Department of Physics
* Department of Engineering and Architecture
* Department of Mathematics and Geosciences
* Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences
* Department of Life Sciences
* Department of Economic, Business, Mathematical and Statistical Sciences
* Department of Legal, Language, Interpreting and Translation Studies
* Department of Political and Social Sciences
* Department of Humanities

A Language Centre was established as an independent service on 1 January 2003. The centre provides fundamental support in the following areas: organisation and running of taught language courses in all the Faculties of Trieste University; organisation of Italian courses (beginner, intermediate and advanced level) for Erasmus students both going abroad and coming to Trieste.

==Structures==

The main campus is centered on the building in Piazzale Europa, on the Scoglietto hill, housing the Rector&#x27;s office, the Administration offices, the Main Library and the faculties of Law and Political Sciences. Other buildings in the campus host the faculties of Economics, Pharmacy, Mathematical, Physical and Natural Sciences, Engineering, the Medical Institutes of Microbiology and Physiology, the towing tank, the Data Processing Centre, the Department of Chemical Sciences and the Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Macromolecular Chemistry. Within the premises are also sited the university canteen and three university dorms, run by the ARDISS - Agenzia Regionale per il Diritto agli Studi Superiori (Regional Agency for the Right to Higher Education).
Other departments are located in different parts of the town. The Department of Geological Sciences and the Department of Earth Sciences are accommodated in the buildings of the former psychiatric hospital, not far away from the main campus, inside San Giovanni Park.

In the heart of the city near the seafront, the old buildings of Via dell&#x27;Università and Via del Lazzaretto vecchio house the Department of Humanities, while the Narodni Dom* houses the Section of Studies in Modern Languages for Interpreting and Translation, the first advanced school of for interpreters and translators in Italy. *Restitution to the Slovenian community of Trieste in 2020.

The Faculty of Medicine and Surgery is located in several university compounds, particularly in structures annexed to the three town hospitals: Cattinara, Trieste General Hospital (&quot;Ospedale Maggiore&quot;), and Burlo Garofolo.
Far from the city centre, near the ICTP (International Centre for Theoretical Physics) there is the Department of Theoretical Physics, in the village of Miramare-Grignano, while the Department of Astronomy is housed near Trieste&#x27;s two Astronomical Observatories: on San Vito hill and on the karst plateau, in Basovizza.

A few faculties are not in Trieste, but in other cities of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region and in the neighboring Veneto region. Particularly, in the Pordenone campus, there are undergraduate and graduate programs in Engineering and Education, while the Gorizia campus offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in International and Diplomatic Studies (part of the Faculty of Political Sciences) and three first-level degree: Business communication and human resource management, Economics and tourism management, Territorial policy. Finally, the Portogruaro campus in the Veneto region hosts the Teaching Sciences Department.
== Trieste System ==
In 2020, Trieste was declared as the &quot;European City of Science&quot; and hosted the EuroScience Open Forum, the most important European event dedicated to science, technology, society and policy. Trieste International Foundation (TIF) is the promoter of Trieste System which is worldwide known as the &#x27;United Nations System of Sciences&#x27;. Following international institutes located or headquartered in Trieste maintains collaborations, research and academic affiliations with the University of Trieste and offers programmes at different level from undergraduate to doctorate.

<text>Sir John McLeod Scarlett (born 18 August 1948) is a British senior intelligence officer. He was Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) from 2004 to 2009. Prior to this appointment, he had chaired the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC).

==Biography==
Scarlett was born in Southwark. Fluent in French and Russian, Scarlett was educated at Epsom College and Magdalen College, Oxford, where in 1970 he received a first class degree in history.

In 1968, Scarlett was at Grosvenor Square during a protest against the Vietnam War in front of the United States Embassy and wrote to &quot;The Times&quot; at the time, criticising the police action.

Shortly afterward, in 1971, he was recruited by MI6 and served in Moscow, Nairobi (1973–1976), and Paris. In 1994, after a tit-for-tat row between the British and Russian authorities, Scarlett was expelled from Moscow where he had been MI6&#x27;s station chief. He later became Director of Security and Public Affairs.

==Joint Intelligence Committee==

Scarlett took on the role of head of the JIC one week before the September 11 attacks.

The normally secretive intelligence services were thrust into the public gaze in the Summer of 2003 after the death of the eminent government weapons expert, Dr David Kelly. Kelly had been found dead in the Oxfordshire countryside near his home, after being exposed as the source of allegations that the government had &quot;sexed-up&quot; intelligence regarding existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The &quot;classic case&quot; was the claim that Iraq could launch Weapons of Mass Destruction &quot;within 45 minutes of an order to do so&quot;—Dr Kelly had privately dismissed this as &quot;risible&quot;.

Scarlett gave evidence at the Hutton Inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Kelly&#x27;s death. It became clear that Scarlett had worked closely with Alastair Campbell, then British Prime Minister Tony Blair&#x27;s Director of Communications and Strategy, on the controversial September Dossier, with Campbell making drafting suggestions which the inquiry found may have &quot;subconsciously influenced&quot; Scarlett and the JIC. This influence may have had deleterious effects on the quality of the assessments presented in the dossier. For instance, the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament made several criticisms in their report &quot;Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction: Intelligence and Assessments&quot;:

:&quot;As the 45 minutes claim was new to its readers, the context of the intelligence and any assessment needed to be explained. The fact that it was assessed to refer to battlefield chemical and biological munitions and their movement on the battlefield, not to any other form of chemical or biological attack, should have been highlighted in the dossier. The omission of the context and assessment allowed speculation as to its exact meaning. This was unhelpful to an understanding of this issue.&quot;

Scarlett became the head of SIS on 6 May 2004, before publication of the findings of the Butler Review. Although the review highlighted many failings in the intelligence behind the Iraq war and the workings of the Joint Intelligence Committee, it specifically stated that Scarlett should not resign as head of the Committee and SIS.

On 8 December 2009, Scarlett gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry. He denied he was under any pressure to &quot;firm up&quot; the September Dossier, and claimed there was &quot;no conscious intention&quot; to mislead about Iraq&#x27;s weapons but it would have been &quot;better&quot; to have clarified battlefield munitions not missiles were meant.

On 26 June 2011, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported on a memo from Scarlett to Blair&#x27;s foreign affairs adviser, released under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, which referred to &quot;the benefit of obscuring the fact that in terms of WMD Iraq is not that exceptional&quot;. The memo has been described as one of the most significant documents on the September dossier yet published as it is considered a proposal to mislead the public.

==Post retirement==
On 28 January 2011, Scarlett was appointed to the board of Times Newspapers Ltd, part of News International, which publishes &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. He has previously been a governor of Epsom College, and is the former chairman of the Bletchley Park Trust.

==Honours and controversy==
Scarlett was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1987 Birthday Honours and a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 2001 New Year Honours.

He was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 2007 New Year Honours. Scarlett, while Chairman of the JIC, was the principal author of the assessments on which the September Dossier was based, a document partly by which Tony Blair justified to Parliament the invasion of Iraq and which was later found to be &quot;flawed&quot; by the Butler Review.

==In popular culture==
In the 2022 ITVX miniseries &quot;Litvinenko&quot;, Scarlett was portrayed by Simon Paisley Day.

<text>Thoralf Albert Skolem (; 23 May 1887 – 23 March 1963) was a Norwegian mathematician who worked in mathematical logic and set theory.

== Life ==
Although Skolem&#x27;s father was a primary school teacher, most of his extended family were farmers. Skolem attended secondary school in Kristiania (later renamed Oslo), passing the university entrance examinations in 1905. He then entered Det Kongelige Frederiks Universitet to study mathematics, also taking courses in physics, chemistry, zoology and botany.

In 1909, he began working as an assistant to the physicist Kristian Birkeland, known for bombarding magnetized spheres with electrons and obtaining aurora-like effects; thus Skolem&#x27;s first publications were physics papers written jointly with Birkeland. In 1913, Skolem passed the state examinations with distinction, and completed a dissertation titled &quot;Investigations on the Algebra of Logic&quot;. He also traveled with Birkeland to the Sudan to observe the zodiacal light. He spent the winter semester of 1915 at the University of Göttingen, at the time the leading research center in mathematical logic, metamathematics, and abstract algebra, fields in which Skolem eventually excelled. In 1916 he was appointed a research fellow at Det Kongelige Frederiks Universitet. In 1918, he became a Docent in Mathematics and was elected to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

Skolem did not at first formally enroll as a Ph.D. candidate, believing that the Ph.D. was unnecessary in Norway. He later changed his mind and submitted a thesis in 1926, titled &quot;Some theorems about integral solutions to certain algebraic equations and inequalities&quot;. His notional thesis advisor was Axel Thue, even though Thue had died in 1922.

In 1927, he married Edith Wilhelmine Hasvold.

Skolem continued to teach at Det kongelige Frederiks Universitet (renamed the University of Oslo in 1939) until 1930 when he became a Research Associate in Chr. Michelsen Institute in Bergen. This senior post allowed Skolem to conduct research free of administrative and teaching duties. However, the position also required that he reside in Bergen, a city which then lacked a university and hence had no research library, so that he was unable to keep abreast of the mathematical literature. In 1938, he returned to Oslo to assume the Professorship of Mathematics at the university. There he taught the graduate courses in algebra and number theory, and only occasionally on mathematical logic. Skolem&#x27;s Ph.D. student Øystein Ore went on to a career in the USA.

Skolem served as president of the Norwegian Mathematical Society, and edited the &quot;Norsk Matematisk Tidsskrift&quot; (&quot;The Norwegian Mathematical Journal&quot;) for many years. He was also the founding editor of &quot;Mathematica Scandinavica&quot;.

After his 1957 retirement, he made several trips to the United States, speaking and teaching at universities there. He remained intellectually active until his sudden and unexpected death.

For more on Skolem&#x27;s academic life, see Fenstad (1970).

== Mathematics ==
Skolem published around 180 papers on Diophantine equations, group theory, lattice theory, and most of all, set theory and mathematical logic. He mostly published in Norwegian journals with limited international circulation, so that his results were occasionally rediscovered by others. An example is the Skolem–Noether theorem, characterizing the automorphisms of simple algebras. Skolem published a proof in 1927, but Emmy Noether independently rediscovered it a few years later.

Skolem was among the first to write on lattices. In 1912, he was the first to describe a free distributive lattice generated by &quot;n&quot; elements. In 1919, he showed that every implicative lattice (now also called a Skolem lattice) is distributive and, as a partial converse, that every finite distributive lattice is implicative. After these results were rediscovered by others, Skolem published a 1936 paper in German, &quot;Über gewisse &#x27;Verbände&#x27; oder &#x27;Lattices&#x27;&quot;, surveying his earlier work in lattice theory.

Skolem was a pioneer model theorist. In 1920, he greatly simplified the proof of a theorem Leopold Löwenheim first proved in 1915, resulting in the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, which states that if a countable first-order theory has an infinite model, then it has a countable model. His 1920 proof employed the axiom of choice, but he later (1922 and 1928) gave proofs using Kőnig&#x27;s lemma in place of that axiom. It is notable that Skolem, like Löwenheim, wrote on mathematical logic and set theory employing the notation of his fellow pioneering model theorists Charles Sanders Peirce and Ernst Schröder, including Π, Σ as variable-binding quantifiers, in contrast to the notations of Peano, Principia Mathematica, and &quot;Principles of Mathematical Logic&quot;. Skolem (1934) pioneered the construction of non-standard models of arithmetic and set theory.

Skolem (1922) refined Zermelo&#x27;s axioms for set theory by replacing Zermelo&#x27;s vague notion of a &quot;definite&quot; property with any property that can be coded in first-order logic. The resulting axiom is now part of the standard axioms of set theory. Skolem also pointed out that a consequence of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem is what is now known as Skolem&#x27;s paradox: If Zermelo&#x27;s axioms are consistent, then they must be satisfiable within a countable domain, even though they prove the existence of uncountable sets.

== Completeness ==
The completeness of first-order logic is a corollary of results Skolem proved in the early 1920s and discussed in Skolem (1928), but he failed to note this fact, perhaps because mathematicians and logicians did not become fully aware of completeness as a fundamental metamathematical problem until the 1928 first edition of Hilbert and Ackermann&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Mathematical Logic&quot; clearly articulated it. In any event, Kurt Gödel first proved this completeness in 1930.

Skolem distrusted the completed infinite and was one of the founders of finitism in mathematics. Skolem (1923) sets out his primitive recursive arithmetic, a very early contribution to the theory of computable functions, as a means of avoiding the so-called paradoxes of the infinite. Here he developed the arithmetic of the natural numbers by first defining objects by primitive recursion, then devising another system to prove properties of the objects defined by the first system. These two systems enabled him to define prime numbers and to set out a considerable amount of number theory. If the first of these systems can be considered as a programming language for defining objects, and the second as a programming logic for proving properties about the objects, Skolem can be seen as an unwitting pioneer of theoretical computer science.

In 1929, Presburger proved that Peano arithmetic without multiplication was consistent, complete, and decidable. The following year, Skolem proved that the same was true of Peano arithmetic without addition, a system named Skolem arithmetic in his honor. Gödel&#x27;s famous 1931 result is that Peano arithmetic itself (with both addition and multiplication) is incompletable and hence &quot;a posteriori&quot; undecidable.

Hao Wang praised Skolem&#x27;s work as follows:
Skolem tends to treat general problems by concrete examples. He often seemed to present proofs in the same order as he came to discover them. This results in a fresh informality as well as a certain inconclusiveness. Many of his papers strike one as progress reports. Yet his ideas are often pregnant and potentially capable of wide application. He was very much a &#x27;free spirit&#x27;: he did not belong to any school, he did not found a school of his own, he did not usually make heavy use of known results... he was very much an innovator and most of his papers can be read and understood by those without much specialized knowledge. It seems quite likely that if he were young today, logic... would not have appealed to him. (Skolem 1970: 17-18)

<text>The AFL–NFL merger was the merger of the two major professional American football leagues in the United States at the time: the National Football League (NFL) and the American Football League (AFL). It paved the way for the combined league, which retained the &quot;National Football League&quot; name and logo, to become the most popular sports league in the United States. The merger was announced on the evening of June 8, 1966. Under the merger agreement, the leagues maintained separate regular-season schedules for the next four seasons—from 1966 through 1969 with a final championship game which would become known as the Super Bowl—and then officially merged before the 1970 season to form one league with two conferences.

==Background==
===Early rivals===

Following its inception in 1920, the NFL fended off several rival leagues. Before 1960, its most important rival was the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), which began play in 1946. The AAFC differed from the NFL in several ways. Despite relatively strong backing at the league&#x27;s inception, it ultimately proved an unsustainable venture. The AAFC&#x27;s most serious weakness resulted from its refusal to implement an initial draft; this caused a massive lack of competitive balance, and resulted in the league&#x27;s strongest team (the Cleveland Browns) dominating the league and becoming perennial champions.

Due to the AAFC&#x27;s poor financial situation, the league disbanded after the 1949 season. Three AAFC teams—the Cleveland Browns, the San Francisco 49ers, and the original version of the Baltimore Colts—were absorbed into the NFL in 1950. The league was briefly known as the &quot;National-American Football League&quot; during the offseason, but reverted to the traditional name of &quot;National Football League&quot; by the time the 1950 season began. The Browns went on to shock NFL loyalists by dominating the older league and winning the championship in their first NFL season, thus proving themselves to be among the best professional football teams of that time.

===Emergence of the AFL===
After the NFL absorbed the AAFC in 1950, it had no other rival US leagues throughout the 1950s. The only other professional gridiron football leagues then in operation were the Canadian leagues that would merge to form the present day Canadian Football League in 1958.

In 1959, Lamar Hunt, son of Texas oil magnate H. L. Hunt, attempted to either gain ownership of the Chicago Cardinals with Bud Adams and move them to Dallas, or own an NFL expansion franchise in Dallas. The league, however, was not interested in expansion at the time. Rebuffed in his attempts to gain at least part-ownership in an NFL team, Hunt conceived the idea of a rival professional football league, the &quot;American Football League&quot;. In September 1959, Hunt was approached by the NFL about an expansion team in Dallas, but by then Hunt was interested only in the AFL.

The new league had six franchises by August 1959 and eight by the time of its first opening day in 1960: Boston Patriots, Buffalo Bills, Titans of New York, Houston Oilers, Denver Broncos, Dallas Texans, Oakland Raiders, and Los Angeles Chargers. While the Los Angeles, New York, Oakland, and Dallas teams shared media markets with NFL teams (the Rams, Giants, 49ers, and the expansion Dallas Cowboys, respectively), the other four teams (Boston, Buffalo, Denver, and Houston) widened the nation&#x27;s exposure to professional football by serving markets that had no NFL team. In the following years, this additional exposure was widened via the relocation of two of the original eight franchises (the Chargers to San Diego in 1961 and the Texans to Kansas City in 1963), and the addition of two expansion franchises (the Miami Dolphins and Cincinnati Bengals).

From small colleges and predominantly black colleges (a source mainly ignored by the NFL), the AFL signed stars such as Elbert Dubenion (Bluffton), Lionel Taylor (New Mexico Highlands), Tom Sestak (McNeese State), Charlie Tolar and Charlie Hennigan (Northwestern State of Louisiana), Abner Haynes (North Texas State), and a host of others. From major colleges, it signed talented players like LSU&#x27;s Heisman Trophy winner Billy Cannon, Arkansas&#x27;s Lance Alworth, Notre Dame&#x27;s Daryle Lamonica, Kansas&#x27; John Hadl, Alabama&#x27;s Joe Namath, and many more. The AFL also signed players the NFL had given up on: so-called &quot;NFL rejects&quot; who turned out to be superstars that the NFL had mis-evaluated. These included Jack Kemp, Babe Parilli, George Blanda, Ron McDole, Art Powell, John Tracey, Don Maynard, and Len Dawson.

The AFL introduced many policies and rules to professional football which the NFL later adopted, including:

* A 14-game regular season schedule, which the NFL adopted in 1961 (increased from 12 games), exactly one year after the AFL&#x27;s inaugural season.
* Players&#x27; last names on the jersey back.
* A slightly narrower and longer ball, the Spalding J5V, which was easier to throw than the NFL ball, &quot;The Duke&quot; from Wilson.
* The introduction of the two-point conversion to pro football, conforming to the college rule adopted in the 1958 college football season.
* Official time on the scoreboard clock, as opposed to it being kept by on-field officials.
* One network television broadcast package for league games, first with ABC from 1960 through 1964, then with NBC.
* The sharing of gate and television revenues by home and visiting teams.

===Competition between the two leagues===
At first, the NFL ignored the AFL and its eight teams, assuming the AFL would consist of players who could not earn a contract in the NFL. The NFL also had the media advantage: for example, in the 1960s, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s lead football writer was Tex Maule, who previously worked with NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle when Rozelle was the general manager of the L.A. Rams and Maule was the team&#x27;s public relations director; Maule &quot;was certainly an NFL loyalist&quot;, and several sports reporters took his deprecatory columns about the AFL as fact. Another example was Dallas Cowboys general manager Tex Schramm, a close friend of Rozelle (Schramm hired Rozelle as Rams&#x27; GM), who was influential in NFL coverage by its national TV partner, CBS, including the network&#x27;s employment of former NFL players as game announcers and the absence of AFL scores and reports on the network.

The AFL enjoyed one critical advantage over its established rival, which was that its owners on average were wealthier than their NFL counterparts. With a few exceptions, Hunt had successfully recruited owners who not only had deep pockets, but more importantly, the patience and willingness to absorb the inevitable financial losses of the fledgling league&#x27;s early years. Therefore, in spite of the bad press, and unlike the NFL&#x27;s previous rivals, the AFL was able to survive and grow, and began to prosper in the mid-1960s after the relocation of the Chargers and Texans to non-NFL markets, the sale and rebranding of the Titans of New York (to the Jets), and the Jets&#x27; signing of University of Alabama quarterback Joe Namath to an unprecedented $427,000 contract. The league&#x27;s financial survival was further buoyed by NBC&#x27;s $36 million, five-year contract to televise AFL games beginning in 1965.

As the commercial rivalry between the leagues intensified, both leagues entered into a bidding war over the top college prospects, paying unprecedented amounts of money for the best players coming out of college. The bidding wars escalated in the mid-1960s, with the respective drafts held on the same day in the late fall.

By contrast, many NFL owners had comparatively little wealth outside the value of their respective franchises. The NFL consistently outdrew the AFL at the gate, especially in the AFL&#x27;s first few seasons, thus ensuring that the older league&#x27;s franchises remained considerably more lucrative enterprises compared to their AFL rivals. Nevertheless, NFL owners knew they did not have unlimited resources to wage a protracted bidding war with the AFL.

Moreover, owners in both leagues feared that the reserve clause written into the standard players&#x27; contracts of both leagues would not survive a legal challenge. These fears ultimately proved well-founded in retrospect, as after the merger in football was finalized, the World Hockey Association would successfully challenge the National Hockey League&#x27;s similar reserve clause in court.

National Football League teams had long adhered to the practice of drafting for and retaining the NFL rights to players who signed with other leagues. This policy ensured, for example, that if a Canadian Football League player developed into a star, only one particular NFL team would have the right to sign him. This ensured that NFL teams did not become embroiled in costly bidding wars for top free agents. Once the American Football League commenced operations, NFL teams extended this policy to cover AFL players as well, and the AFL promptly reciprocated the arrangement. This arrangement soon evolved into a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement between the two U.S. leagues that extended even beyond the arrangement the NFL observed with respect to the CFL — specifically, once a player signed with a U.S. professional team, be it from the AFL or NFL, teams in both U.S. leagues were expected to honor each other&#x27;s player contracts in their entirety (including the respective reserve clauses) and not sign players who were &quot;under contract&quot; with teams in the rival league.

This unwritten agreement was broken in May 1966, when the NFL&#x27;s New York Giants signed placekicker Pete Gogolak, who had played out his option in 1965 with the AFL&#x27;s Buffalo Bills. The NFL&#x27;s contravention of the gentlemen&#x27;s agreement resulted in retaliation by the AFL: Oakland Raiders co-owner Al Davis took over as AFL Commissioner in April 1966, and he stepped up the bidding war after the Gogolak transfer, signing notable NFL players, including John Brodie, Mike Ditka, and Roman Gabriel to contracts with AFL teams. Both leagues spent a combined $7 million signing their 1966 draft picks.

==The merger agreement==

The NFL initiated discussions for a merger between the two leagues through a backchannel: Tex Schramm, the general manager of the NFL&#x27;s Dallas Cowboys since 1960, secretly contacted AFL owners, led by Lamar Hunt of Kansas City, and asked if they were interested in a merger. The talks were conducted without the knowledge of Davis, the new AFL commissioner. On the evening of June 8, 1966, the collaborators announced a merger agreement in New York. Under the agreement:
* The two leagues would combine to form an expanded league with 24 teams, to be increased to 26 teams by 1969, and to 28 by 1970, or soon thereafter. In any case, the Atlanta Falcons and the Miami Dolphins were already established and set to start play for the 1966 season, before the merger was announced in June. The leagues would add the New Orleans Saints in 1967 and the Cincinnati Bengals in 1968 prior to the merger.
* All existing franchises would be retained, and none would be moved outside of their metropolitan areas. The agreement also stipulated that no new franchises were to be placed by either league within the media markets of the other. 
* The Oakland Raiders and New York Jets would pay indemnities to the San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants, respectively. 
* Both leagues would hold a &quot;common draft&quot; of college players, effectively ending the bidding war between the two leagues over the top college prospects, with the first such draft occurring in mid-March 1967.
* The leagues would maintain separate regular season schedules through 1969. However, interleague preseason play would commence in 1967.
* The leagues agreed to play an annual AFL–NFL World Championship Game, matching the champions of each league, beginning in January 1967; the game that would eventually become known as the Super Bowl. Unlike the championship games of the leagues, which were always hosted by one of the participating teams, the interleague championship game would be held at a predetermined location.
* The two leagues would officially merge in to form one league with two conferences. The merged league would be known as the National Football League. The leagues agreed to adopt unified rules by 1970 at the latest. The leagues also agreed to not unilaterally adopt new rules that deviated from the established rules of professional American football in the interim, although the AFL was permitted to retain pre-existing rule variations such as the two point conversion for the remainder of its existence.
* The history and records of the AFL would be incorporated into the older league. In essence, for all relevant purposes the AFL franchises were to be regarded by the NFL as if they had joined the older league in whatever season they commenced play in the AFL.
* The AFL would abolish the office of AFL Commissioner immediately and recognize the NFL Commissioner as the overall chief executive of professional football. This arrangement, which was in keeping with a provision of the NFL&#x27;s Constitution dating from 1941 (when the title of &quot;Commissioner&quot; was introduced in football) that sought to invest the NFL&#x27;s chief executive with a similar level of authority to that exercised by the Commissioner of Baseball, formally ended the AFL&#x27;s six-year run as an independent league.
* NFL Films would start recording game footage for the AFL starting in 1968 under a newly established &quot;AFL Films&quot; division. The two season wait was agreed at the insistence of NFL Films founder Ed Sabol, who contended that he needed adequate time to hire and train additional personnel. Thus, in practice the &quot;AFL Films&quot; crews were simply regular NFL Films crews, although they were issued distinct jackets for AFL contests.

Following the agreement, American Football League owners created the office of AFL &quot;President&quot; with a mandate to administer the league&#x27;s day-to-day business in a semi-autonomous manner, much like the way the constituent leagues of Major League Baseball operated at the time. The owners had hoped Davis would continue to serve in that role, but Davis flatly refused to consider serving as a subordinate to Pete Rozelle. After Davis resigned as AFL Commissioner on July 25, 1966, Milt Woodard (who was assistant commissioner under the original commissioner Joe Foss and Davis) was appointed to serve as President of the AFL.

Although Pete Rozelle had not initiated the merger negotiations, he quickly endorsed the agreement. In addition to remaining in his post as NFL Commissioner, Rozelle was duly appointed &quot;chief executive&quot; of the AFL the day after Davis&#x27; resignation, and would hold the post through to the completion of the merger. In practice, the media often simply referred to Rozelle as the &quot;football commissioner&quot; or &quot;commissioner of football&quot; during the four years following the merger agreement. The pre-existing office of &quot;NFL President&quot; continued effectively unchanged following the agreement. Then occupied by Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell, the NFL presidency was (both before and after the merger agreement) essentially an honorary title. In practice, Rozelle generally respected Woodard&#x27;s mandate. The most notorious example of Rozelle directly intervening in AFL affairs came prior to the 1969 season when he forced Super Bowl III-winning quarterback Joe Namath to divest his stake in a New York nightclub with alleged ties to gambling and organized crime.

Many of the conditions of the merger were designed to ensure passage of a law by the 89th U.S. Congress, exempting the merged league from antitrust sanctions. When NFL Commissioner Rozelle and other professional football executives appeared before the Congress&#x27; Subcommittee on Antitrust, chaired by New York Representative Emanuel Celler, three points were repeatedly made:
* Rozelle promised that if the merger was allowed, no existing professional football franchise of either league would be moved from any city as a result.
* The combined league would eventually expand to 28 teams as stipulated in the merger agreement.
* Stadiums seating less than 50,000 were declared to be inadequate for professional football&#x27;s needs, thus compelling teams in stadiums with capacities under that number to expand their current stadiums or move to newer, larger homes.

In October, Congress passed the new law to permit the merger to proceed.

As 1970 approached, three NFL teams (the Baltimore Colts, Cleveland Browns, and Pittsburgh Steelers), agreed to join the ten AFL teams to form the American Football Conference (AFC). The other thirteen NFL teams (Atlanta Falcons, Chicago Bears, Dallas Cowboys, Detroit Lions, Green Bay Packers, Los Angeles Rams, Minnesota Vikings, New Orleans Saints, New York Giants, Philadelphia Eagles, St. Louis Cardinals, San Francisco 49ers and Washington Redskins) became part of the National Football Conference (NFC).

Since 1970, the Super Bowl has featured the champions of the AFC and NFC. Both are determined each season by the league&#x27;s playoff tournament. With the creation of the new conferences of equal size, it was deemed necessary that they each be aligned into three divisions of four or five teams each. The 1970 playoff format combined elements of both leagues&#x27; playoff formats. Four teams would qualify for the postseason from each conference (same as in 1969), thus only the &quot;&quot;Best&quot; Second Place Team&quot; (as it was originally called) would reach the postseason. Fans and media quickly dubbed this team the &quot;wild card&quot; and the NFL soon made that name official.

Although the AFC teams quickly decided on a divisional alignment along mostly geographic lines, the 13 NFC owners had trouble deciding which teams would play in which divisions. The 49ers and Rams, both in California, were guaranteed to be in the same division as the only NFC teams west of the Rocky Mountains. One early proposal would have put the two California teams together with the three Northeast teams—the New York Giants, Philadelphia Eagles and Washington Redskins—reminiscent of the Western Conference&#x27;s Coastal Division which had put L.A. and S.F. together with Baltimore and Atlanta from 1967 to 1969. The final five proposals were as follows:

PLAN 1: East: NYG, PHI, WAS, ATL, MIN; Central: CHI, GB, DET, NO; West: LA, SF, DAL, STL.

PLAN 2: East: NYG, PHI, WAS, MIN; Central: ATL, DAL, NO, STL; West: LA, SF, CHI, GB, DET.

PLAN 3: East: NYG, PHI, WAS, DAL, STL: Central: CHI, GB, DET, MIN; West: LA, SF, ATL, NO.

PLAN 4: East: NYG, PHI, WAS, STL, MIN; Central: CHI, GB, DET, ATL; West: LA, SF, DAL, NO.

PLAN 5: East: NYG, PHI, WAS, DET, MIN; Central: CHI, GB, DAL, STL; West: LA, SF, ATL, NO.

These five combinations were written up on slips of paper, sealed into envelopes and put into a fish bowl (other sources say a flower vase), and the official NFC alignment—Plan 3—was pulled out by Rozelle&#x27;s secretary, Thelma Elkjer. Of the five plans considered, the one that was put into effect was the only one which had Minnesota remaining in the Central Division and Dallas playing in the Eastern Division.

Meanwhile, all three of the major television networks signed contracts to televise games, ensuring the combined league&#x27;s stability. CBS agreed to broadcast all games where an NFC team was on the road, NBC agreed to broadcast all games where an AFC team was on the road, and ABC agreed to broadcast &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, making the NFL the first league to have a regular series of national telecasts in prime time.

==Aftermath==
Many observers believe that the NFL got the better end of the bargain, as Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis and New York Jets owner Sonny Werblin resisted the indemnity payments.

Long-time sports writer Jerry Magee of the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; wrote: &quot;Al Davis taking over as commissioner was the strongest thing the AFL ever did. He thought the AFL–NFL merger was a detriment to the AFL.&quot; However, other observers consider those scenarios far-fetched: the NFL had a richer television contract at the time of the merger, in large part because of market exclusivity in such leading population centers as Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore, Atlanta and the Dallas–Fort Worth area, which were rapidly increasing in population and would emerge as media strongholds in the 1970s.

Despite AFL triumphs in Super Bowls III and IV, the old-guard NFL was still widely expected to dominate the merged league over the course of an entire season. In 1970, these predictions were proven to be more or less correct: out of 60 regular season games pitting old-line NFL teams versus former AFL teams, former AFL teams went 19–39 (two games, Buffalo at Baltimore in week 9 and St. Louis at Kansas City in week 10, ended in ties). Only Oakland managed to post a winning record against old-line NFL opposition, going 3–2 (defeating Washington, Pittsburgh and Cleveland; losing to Detroit and San Francisco) before losing to the Colts in the AFC championship. Nevertheless, out of the three NFL teams to join the AFC, only the Colts managed to secure a playoff berth.

Each of the first 29 games on the new Monday Night Football featured at least one team from the old-guard NFL, with the first nationally televised prime time game between two former AFL teams being Oakland at Houston on October 9, 1972.

The merger paved the way for a new era of prosperity for the NFL. While a number of rival professional football leagues have commenced play since 1970 including the XFL, WFL, USFL, UFL, and AAF alongside revivals of the XFL and USFL that later merged together into a new UFL, and while the CFL once experimented with U.S.-based teams, none of these ventures came close to being a serious challenge to the NFL.

Pursuant to the agreement, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the AFC in 1976, and the Seattle Seahawks joined the NFC. The 1976 expansion teams switched conference before their second season in the league, becoming the first NFL teams to change conferences after the merger.

In spite of Rozelle&#x27;s promise that there would be no re-locations involving teams in existence at the time of the merger, by the end of his tenure as commissioner in 1989 three franchises had moved to a different market from where they were based in 1970.

<text>The Sunda Islands (; Tetun: &quot;Illa Sunda&quot;) are a group of islands in the Nusantara (Indonesian Archipelago). They consist of the Greater Sunda Islands and the Lesser Sunda Islands.

==Etymology==
&quot;Sunda&quot; denotes the continental shelves or landmasses: the Sunda Shelf in the west and the Sahul/Arafuru Shelf in the east. Other terms associated with &quot;Sunda&quot; include the Sunda Island Arc or the arc of Sunda Islands, Sunda Fold or tectonic folding in the Natuna Sea, the Sunda Trench, and Sundaland.
The term &quot;Sunda&quot; has been traced back to ancient times. The name &quot;Sunda&quot; originates from the Sanskrit word &quot;Cuddha,&quot; meaning white. During the Pleistocene era, there was a large volcano named Mount Sunda located north of Bandung in West Java. Its eruption covered the surrounding area with white volcanic ash, giving rise to the name &quot;Sunda.&quot;
The use of the term &quot;Sunda&quot; to refer to the Indonesian region dates back to the claims of Claudius Ptolemaeus in 150 AD. 

In the 16th century, the Portuguese established diplomatic relations with the Sunda Kingdom and mapped the territory of the Sunda Kingdom and its surroundings. They categorized the region into Greater Sunda (Sunda Besar) for the larger western islands and Lesser Sunda (Sunda Kecil) for the smaller eastern islands.
Since then, the term &quot;Sunda&quot; has been widely adopted in earth sciences (geology-geography) as a reference for the Indonesian region, surpassing the usage of &quot;Indonesia&quot; in this field. The terms Greater Sunda and Lesser Sunda are commonly used in geological-geographical literature.

== Administration ==
The Sunda Islands are divided among five countries: Brunei, East Timor, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. The majority of these islands fall under the jurisdiction of Indonesia. Borneo is split among Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Timor is split between East Timor and Indonesia. Sebatik is split between Indonesia and Malaysia.

<text>James Pineo Grant (May 12, 1922 – January 28, 1995) was an American diplomat and children&#x27;s advocate. Grant served for 15 years (from January 1980 to January 1995) as the third executive director of the United Nations Children&#x27;s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), with the rank of Under Secretary-General.

Grant was born at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing. He lived in China until the age of 15, where his father, John Black Grant, was the first professor of Public Health at the Rockefeller Foundation-funded Peking Union Medical College. Grant attended the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1943 in economics, and in 1951 graduated from Harvard Law School.

Grant began his international civil service in the late 1940s working in China with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

In 1962, was named Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near East and South Asian Affairs and deputy director of the International Cooperation Administration, the precursor to the United States Agency for International Development. From 1964 until 1967 Grant served as the USAID Mission Director in Turkey. In 1967 he was appointed the Assistant Administrator of USAID for Southeast Asia, a position he held until 1969. After he left USAID in 1969 he formed the Overseas Development Council, becoming its president and CEO. Grant left the ODC after being appointed UNICEF executive director. He served in that position from January 1980 to January 1995. As Marcos Cueto mentioned in article, &quot;Under Grant&#x27;s dynamic leadership, UNICEF began to back away from a holistic approach to primary health care. Grant believed that international agencies had to do their best with finite resources and short-lived local political opportunities. This meant translating general goals into time-bound specific actions. A few years later, Grant organized a UNICEF book that proposed a &quot;children&#x27;s revolution&quot; and explained the 4 inexpensive interventions contained in GOBI.&quot; On August 8, 1994, he was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President William Clinton.

Grant was diagnosed with cancer in May 1993, but continued to lead UNICEF until he resigned on January 23, 1995, and died a few days later, at age 72.

Nicholas D. Kristof wrote in 2008 that Grant, &quot;a little-known American aid worker,&quot; had &quot;probably saved more lives than were destroyed by Hitler, Mao, and Stalin combined&quot; through his promotion of vaccinations and diarrhea treatments. Grant had been universally known within UN as a man who could not accept the undoable: he would be often found scribbling on a pad, laughing to himself, &quot;It can be done! It can be done&quot;

==Social Entrepreneurship==
James P. Grant, during his years as deputy director of USAID had been an early backer of The Green Revolution, recognizing the role that a package of technical breakthroughs (improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, pesticides, mechanization) could collectively create; with The Green Revolution in reducing world hunger. In 1973, in his annual lecture at Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s School of Public Health (personally special for him as his father had been in its first graduating class) Grant grasped the scientific breakthroughs that had come out of Carl Taylor&#x27;s Narangwal research (childhood pneumonia, oral rehydration therapy, neonatal tetanus, family planning) and saw an immediate parallel to The Green Revolution, saying &quot;we can now start to talk about a Child Survival Revolution!&quot; 

Grant continued in the years that followed to recognize this as a problem that he was very passionate to reduce when he read Jon Rohde&#x27;s lecture, &quot;Why the Other Half Dies.&quot; Rohde&#x27;s lecture helped Grant realize that each year, &quot;14 million children under the age of five died. And the great majority died at home from diarrhea, pneumonia, malnutrition, and immunizable diseases.&quot; What caught James P. Grant&#x27;s attention was the fact that most child deaths could be completely prevented in cheap and simple ways.

Grant&#x27;s vision was that, &quot;Morality must march with capacity.&quot; He was disgusted that very little had been done to help prevent countless children from dying from very preventable causes, so he took it upon himself and the organization which he was head of, UNICEF, to, &quot;[conceive] and [lead] a worldwide campaign to make simple, low-cost health solutions available to children everywhere.&quot;

In 1982, Grant and UNICEF launched the child survival revolution and unveiled a simple but effective strategy for reducing child fatality. His strategy was known as GOBI-FFF:

G for growth monitoring to detect undernutrition in small children, O for oral rehydration therapy to treat childhood diarrhea, B to encourage breastfeeding (which had declined precipitously due to working mothers and the marketing of infant formula), and I for immunization against the six basic childhood diseases: tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, and measles. (They added two Fs: food supplements and family planning; and, later, a third: female education.)

It is estimated that the child vaccination increased from 20 to 80 percent worldwide in 1990 because of Grant&#x27;s child survival revolution.

It is also estimated that simple procedures prevented deaths from immunizable diseases and severe dehydration for about 4 million children in 1992.

Countless people were saved from a life of disabilities such as polio (An estimated 3 million people saved), blindness from lack of Vitamin A (An estimated million people saved), and brain damaged caused from iodine deficiencies (An estimated 10 million people saved).

It was because of James Grant and his vision, passion and resourcefulness, along with the strength of his conviction and his will to make a difference that these changes were able to take place.

<text>Fair Park is a recreational and educational complex in Dallas, Texas, United States, located immediately east of downtown. The area is registered as a Dallas Landmark and National Historic Landmark; many of the buildings were constructed for the Texas Centennial Exposition in 1936.

Fair Park has been designated a Great Place in America by the American Planning Association.

==History==
The site was established as an fairground on the outskirts of East Dallas for the Dallas State Fair in 1886. After a fire and financial loss by the fair association in 1904, voters approved the &quot;Reardon Plan&quot;. It became Dallas&#x27; second public park, known as &quot;Fair Park&quot;.

An important figure in Fair Park&#x27;s development was landscape architect and city planner George Kessler. In 1906, he was responsible for the first formal plan for the park influenced by the City Beautiful Movement. The City Beautiful Movement advocated well planned public spaces, tree-lined boulevards, monuments, public art, and fountains which would &#x27;beautify&#x27; the city.

A milestone in Fair Park&#x27;s history was 1936, when the Texas Centennial Exposition was held there. In preparation for the six-month event, the appearance of the park was dramatically altered by architect George Dahl and consulting architect Paul Cret. The park was transformed from an early 20th-century fairground into an Art Deco showcase. While many of the exposition&#x27;s buildings were meant to be temporary, several have survived and have been restored to some extent. Over the years, the park was expanded to its current .

Fair Park was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986 as one of the nation&#x27;s largest surviving assemblages of buildings related to an exposition. Administration of the park was transferred to the Dallas Parks Department in 1988. Today, the cultural facilities and annual events attract an unsubstantiated estimate of 5 million visitors annually, the bulk of which attend during the 24-day State Fair of Texas.

===Restoration and future===
Many of the existing Art Deco buildings have been restored visually to their 1936 appearance and upgraded to modern building standards. In anticipation of the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) light rail service expansion to the area, the historic Parry Avenue entrance gates were restored in 2009. The four cameo reliefs on Centennial Building underwent a professional conservation treatment in 2000 and the Esplanade fountain pylons and six monumental sculptures in 2004. Several sculptures were reconstructed and feature a dramatic light and water show.

In 2003, the Fair Park Comprehensive Development plan was produced by Hargreaves Associates. This comprehensive plan included recommendations for the physical site, park programs, activities, funding options, and management alternatives. The park received a $72 million city bond allocation in 2006 for repairs and improvements.

In September 2014, a blue ribbon task force appointed by Mayor Mike Rawlings submitted a report on the rejuvenation of Fair Park. The Mayor&#x27;s Task Force plan envisioned a public-private partnership led by a non profit organization to be charged with over arching powers to control the revitalization of Fair Park, including the State Fair of Texas. Architect/City planner Antonio Di Mambro, with international experience in infrastructure planning and neighborhood revitalization, encouraged the Mayor to use the Task Force report as a building block for constructive dialogue with residents, stakeholders and the neighborhoods around Fair Park. Following the presentation of the Task Force Plan, Mayor Mike Rawlings said, &quot;I felt passion by all the council and park board members that they want Fair Park to be all it can be and they&#x27;re interested in taking this big challenge on&quot;.

In March 2015, the State Fair pushed back on any notion of tightening up the footprint of its current operation. &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; reporter Robert Wilonsky called the State Fair&#x27;s response &quot;rather dramatic&quot; The article also quoted Stephen Page of the closed Texas Museum of Automotive History from 2012 as saying, &quot;The City&#x27;s requirement that tenants vacate the majority of the buildings in Fair Park during the State Fair is the principal reason for Fair Park&#x27;s ongoing decline.&quot; Wilonsky also quoted a &#x27;prominent member of the Mayor&#x27;s Task Force&#x27; as suggesting privately &quot;that the State Fair&#x27;s presence at Fair Park also needs to be greatly reduced.&quot;

On November 18, 2015, Dallas City Council considered Mayor Mike Rawlings&#x27; proposal to turn over management of Fair Park to a non-profit corporation headed up by the &quot;Father of DART&quot; Walt Humann. Under the Mayor&#x27;s plan, the city would still own the 277-acre site, but a non-profit foundation would manage the grounds and assets. In 2016 Mayor Mike Rawlings&#x27; proposal to turn the park over to a non-profit corporation headed by Humann was defeated by the Dallas City Attorney and a lack of support by Dallas City Council.

In October 2018, the Dallas City Council voted unanimously to approve a management contract with Fair Park First. According to the plan, Fair Park First would receive $35 million over 10 years and would implement plans to rejuvenate the park and surrounding community. At the time, some within the city parks board expressed concern that a contract between the non-profit Fair Park First and its for-profit subcontractor, Oak View Group, excluded the city from oversight of park operations. Following a whistleblower report in early 2024 about spending irregularities, a review by the city found that more than $5 million in donor-restricted funds had been improperly used for park operations.

==Cultural district==
Many Dallas cultural institutions call Fair Park home.


;Hall of State

The Hall of State is managed by the Dallas Historical Society, which hosts exhibits inside about Dallas history and culture.

;Old Mill Inn
The Old Mill Inn was one of the few Texas Centennial Exposition buildings not to incorporate Art Deco styling. Clad in fieldstone with heavy-timber construction, this was the exhibit building for the flour milling industry. It now sporadically serves Fair Park as a restaurant.

;Magnolia Lounge and (former) Hall of Religion
This little-known project by New York architect William Lescaze introduced European Modernism to Texas in 1936. The design of this hospitality lounge for the Magnolia Petroleum Company included elements commonly found in Art Deco architecture. However, the building&#x27;s overall image was radically different from that of any other structure at the Texas Centennial Exposition.

Site of Theatre &#x27;47, the first professional, regional theater company in the United States, the small performing space, the Margo Jones Theatre pays tribute to the visionary founder of America&#x27;s regional theater movement Margo Jones. Immediately adjacent to the Magnolia Lounge is the former Hall of Religion.

;African American Museum

The current museum building occupies virtually the same site as the Texas Centennial Exposition&#x27;s Hall of Negro Life. It boasts a permanent collection that consists of the works of such highly regarded African American artists as Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence, Larry D. Alexander, John T. Biggers, Clementine Hunter, Benny Andrews, Edward Mitchell Bannister and Arthello Beck

;The Leonhardt Lagoon
South of the Midway, George Dahl arranged Dallas&#x27;s future cultural institutions informally around a tranquil lagoon, offering Texas Centennial exposition visitors a peaceful, naturalistic counterpoint to the activity of the exposition.

In 1981, Patricia Johanson was commissioned to redesign and restore the badly degraded lagoon. Since reopening in 1986, the redesigned lagoon has become recognized as a major earth sculpture and one of the earliest examples of art as bioremediation.

;Museum of Nature and Science

The Museum of Nature &amp; Science occupied two buildings around the lagoon (one named &quot;The Science Place&quot;), and a planetarium next to the WRR building, before moving most of its operations to the new Perot campus at Victory Park in December 2012. The former History Building remains open on weekends as a secondary campus of the Perot Museum. The IMAX theatre and planetarium at the Fair Park campus are shuttered.

The History Building, once the Museum of Natural History, was designed for the Texas Centennial Exposition as a monolithic, rectangular box. The entrance features three vertical window bays with decorative aluminum mullions. Flanking it are paired pilasters with shell-motif capitals. The rest of the building is clad in limestone. In 1988, the northeast corner of the building was excavated, creating a series of landscaped terraces.

;Fair Park Band Shell
The concentric plaster arches of the Band Shell comprise an essentially Art Deco composition. Elements of the Streamline Moderne style are present in the reinforced concrete backstage building. Lighting pylons surround the sloping 5,000-seat amphitheater.

;Texas Discovery Gardens
This was the original Horticulture Building for the Texas Centennial Exposition. It has since been altered by exterior renovations and additions, including the minimalist glass Blachly Conservatory. In the gardens behind the main structure is a model home that the Portland Cement Company originally built for the Exposition.

;Cotton Bowl

The Cotton Bowl stadium was built in below-grade in 1930, and was originally known as &quot;Fair Park Stadium.&quot; Subsequent expansions resulted in a present capacity of 92,200. The Cotton Bowl Classic college football bowl game was played there from 1937 to 2009. Annually during the State Fair of Texas, it hosts the OU–TX game between the University of Oklahoma and the University of Texas, along with the Southwest Airlines State Fair Classic game between Grambling State University (Louisiana) and Prairie View A&amp;M University. It was also the first home of the Dallas Cowboys, from 1960 until their move to Texas Stadium in Irving in 1971.

;Music Hall at Fair Park

Music Hall, built in Spanish colonial revival style, was the General Motors Building during the Centennial Exposition. It underwent extensive remodeling in 1972. It was home of the Dallas Opera until 2009 and is the current home for Dallas Summer Musicals.

;Women&#x27;s Building

The Women&#x27;s building was originally built in 1910 as a park coliseum. It was remodeled as an Art Deco structure for the Centennial Exposition during which it was known as the Hall of Administration. The building was operated as The Women&#x27;s Museum from 2000 to 2011, but now is only used for special events and exhibits.

==Midway and other structures==

*The Texas Star, opened in 1985, is the fourth-largest Ferris wheel in North America.

*The Texas Skyway, opened in 2007, is an art deco-styled gondola ride that transports visitors above the ground for a ride that is one-third of a mile.
*The Top o&#x27; Texas Tower, opened in 2013, is a observation tower ride. The tower&#x27;s base may eventually house a museum devoted to the State Fair and Texas Centennial Exposition collection. At a cost of more than $12,000,000, the Tower was to be the featured ride of the failed Summer Adventures program. Summer Adventures, while planned as an annual event, was open for one year and shuttered, despite a $30,000,000 investment.

<doc id="453775" wikidata="Q3161118" url="?curid=453775" title="James Grant (navigator)">
<text>James Grant (1772 – 11 November 1833) was a Scottish born British Royal Navy officer and navigator in the early nineteenth century. He served in Australia in 1800–1801 and was the first to map the Bass Strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania.

==Early life==
Grant was baptized on 6 September 1772 at Forres, Morayshire, Scotland. He was educated at King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen, under Dr. William Chalmers. He entered the Royal Navy as a captain&#x27;s servant in August 1793 and was appointed a midshipman in May 1794. He passed his board for promotion to lieutenant and was promoted in 1800.

==Voyages of exploration==
Thanks to his friendship with Captain John Schank, as a lieutenant he took command of , a new vessel of 60 tons fitted with a centre-board (or &quot;Schank&quot;) keel, towards the end of 1799 he sailed from the River Thames for Port Jackson on 18 March 1800. A brig of 60 tons, she carried a crew comprising the commanding officer, two mates and twelve seamen. His instructions were to proceed to Australia to prosecute &quot;the discovery and survey of the unknown parts of the coast of New Holland&quot;, although it was always intended that he should hand the ship to Matthew Flinders and take command of HMS &quot;Supply&quot;. He sailed into Table Cape, South Africa on 8 July 1800. Here Grant received dispatches from the Duke of Portland advising him of the discovery of a strait between New South Wales and Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. He was to sail through it on his way to Port Jackson, instead of sailing around Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. Thus his was the first ship to sail through Bass Strait from west to east, charting the then unknown coastline. &quot;Lady Nelson&quot; entered the heads at Port Jackson at six in the evening of 16 December 1800 after a passage of seventy-one days from Cape Town.

When he arrived, it transpired that Flinders had returned to England and that &quot;Supply&quot; had been laid up as a hulk at Sydney, and Governor King reappointed him to the &quot;Lady Nelson&quot;. He was ordered to return to the deep bay which he had sailed across in Bass Strait and make a general survey of the south coast. He left on 6 March 1801, got as far as Western Port where he conducted a survey. He was back at Sydney on 14 May 1801. On 10 June 1801 Grant sailed to the Hunter River conveying Lieutenant Colonel Paterson, to consider the question of a settlement there and the probable extent of the coal deposits.

After a particularly unpleasant period of disagreement with the officers of the New South Wales Corps in Sydney, Grant asked permission on 31 August 1801 to return to Europe, which was granted. King spoke very favourably of Grant&#x27;s abilities as an officer and seaman, but it is evident that he was not satisfied with Grant&#x27;s survey work on his voyage to Bass Strait, and Grant was himself conscious of his want of knowledge of nautical surveying. After his return Grant published in 1803 his &quot;Narrative of a Voyage of Discovery&quot; which was shortly afterwards translated into Dutch and German.

==Later work==
He reached the rank of commander in January 1805, and was given a pension in 1806 for wounds received in action while in command of hired armed cutter &quot;Hawke&quot; off the Dutch coast. Despite his wounds, he later commanded the sloops and .

==Death==
He died at Saint-Servan, France, on 11 November 1833.

==Legacy==

He was the first European to land on Phillip Island and Churchill Island. The south-west point of Phillip Island is named after him. He established a garden on Churchill Island.

==Grant in fiction==
Grant&#x27;s early career is the base for a character also named James Grant in Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s novel &quot;Desolation Island&quot;, part of the Aubrey–Maturin series. In real life and in the fiction, Grant accomplished much at a young age sailing a sloop to New South Wales (a lieutenant could be captain of a sloop in the Royal Navy of that era) and writing a book about the voyage. In real life he was promoted to commander; in fiction he is still a lieutenant in 1811, but wanting to be the captain.

<text>Klaus Rainer Röhl (1 December 1928 – 30 November 2021) was a German journalist and author, best known as founder, owner, publisher and editor-in-chief of , the most influential magazine on the German political left from the 1960s to the early 1970s. He later became critical of communism and leftist tendencies.

==Journalism==
Known as &quot;K2R&quot;, Röhl founded the left-wing monthly magazine &quot;Studentenkurier&quot; in 1955. Röhl had been a secret Communist since 1951, and the magazine survived due to funding from the Communist East German regime. In 1957, the magazine was renamed and rose to prominence in the 1960s as the primary magazine of the Außerparlamentarische Opposition and the German student movement. He had previously founded a weekly newspaper about and for the Hamburg sex trade, &quot;St Pauli Nachrichten&quot;. After the Communist Party of Germany was banned as unconstitutional in West Germany in 1956, he became a clandestine member of the then illegal party as an act of support.

He was married to Ulrike Meinhof from 1961 until the spring of 1968, before her descent into left-wing terrorism. Their marriage produced two daughters, Regine and Bettina Röhl, who became an author critical of communism and far-left extremism. Ulrike later co-founded the Red Army Faction, also known as the RAF or the Baader-Meinhof Gang, together with Gudrun Ensslin, Andreas Baader, and Jan-Carl Raspe.

==Harassment accusations==
Articles in openly advocated sex with minors. Röhl&#x27;s marriage with Ulrike was his second marriage. From his first marriage he also has a daughter Αnja Röhl, who in May 2010 accused him of sexual harassment against her.

==Change of course==
As a consequence of the radicalization in the late 1960s, and subsequent leftist terrorism, Röhl turned away from Marxism and gave his magazine a more moderate tone. This led to a power struggle between Röhl and those who supported the use of violence against the government (particularly his former wife), and his home in Hamburg was attacked in 1969 by Ulrike Meinhof and some staff members. In June 1970, after Ulrike&#x27;s command, Monica Berberich and Marianne X took Röhl and Ulrike&#x27;s daughters from a house where Ulrike&#x27;s sister, Wienke had hidden the children, in order to transfer them to Gibellina, a commune in Sicily where other left-wing families and communists lived. According to Jutta Ditfurth, Ulrike&#x27;s biographer, Ulrike believed she would win the custody case over the children from Röhl which meant that Wienke would take custody of the kids. Finally, journalist Stefan Aust, a long-time friend of Röhl abducted the children after Peter Homan misinformed him that Ulrike was about to send the children to a Jordanian boarding house where other children of refugees used to live. By that time, Röhl was on holiday in Italy. Aust delivered the girls to him in an apartment near Plaza Navona. Röhl and his daughters lived under constant police protection for some time, fearing a supposed attack or abduction by RAF members. Röhl was also supporting BKA&#x27;s investigation providing information about Meinhof&#x27;s past, places where she could be hiding, etc.

The magazine was dissolved in 1973. The year before, Röhl had joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany. For some years, he then published the moderate leftist magazine &quot;das da&quot;. From 1981 to 1984, he published the left-wing magazine &quot;Spontan&quot;. However, from the mid-1980s, his political views gradually changed towards liberal conservatism. Röhl was a member of the German liberal party, the Free Democratic Party of Germany after 1995, and was then active in Liberale Offensive, the right-wing faction of the party that tried to revive the national liberal tradition represented by Gustav Stresemann, Thomas Dehler, and Erich Mende, among others. He was also a regular columnist for the newspaper &quot;Junge Freiheit&quot;, and earned a doctorate in history at the Free University of Berlin under the supervision of Ernst Nolte in 1993, with a dissertation on cooperation between Communists and National Socialists against the Social Democratic Party (&quot;Nähe zum Gegner&quot;, published as a book in 1994). He wrote several books critical of communism and the far-left.

<text>Atahualpa (), also Atawallpa or Ataw Wallpa (Quechua) ( 150226 July 1533), was the last effective Inca emperor, reigning from April 1532 until his capture and execution in July of the following year, as part of the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire.

== Biography ==
Atahualpa was the son of the emperor Huayna Cápac, who died around 1525 along with his successor, Ninan Cuyochi, in a smallpox epidemic. Atahualpa initially accepted his half-brother Huáscar as the new emperor, who in turn appointed him as governor of Quito in the north of the empire. The uneasy peace between them deteriorated over the next few years. From 1529 to 1532, they contested the succession in the Inca Civil War, in which Atahualpa&#x27;s forces defeated and captured Huáscar.

Around the same time as Atahualpa&#x27;s victory, a group of Spanish conquistadors, led by Francisco Pizarro, arrived in the region. In November 1532, they captured Atahualpa during an ambush at Cajamarca. In captivity, Atahualpa gave a ransom in exchange for a promise of release and arranged for the execution of Huáscar. After receiving the ransom, the Spanish accused Atahualpa of treason, conspiracy against the Spanish Crown, and the murder of Huáscar. They put him on trial and sentenced him to death by burning at the stake. However, after his baptism in July 1533, he was garroted instead.

A line of successors continued to claim the title of emperor, either as Spanish vassals or as rebel leaders, but none were able to hold comparable power.

== Origin ==
=== Name ===

Although this monarch&#x27;s name is written with some major discrepancies in early sources, most spellings seem to reflect (which in contemporary orthography would be written ⟨Ataw Wallpa⟩). As such, ⟨Atabalipa⟩, ⟨Tavalipa⟩ and others are spellings that represent the first impressionistic orthographies of his name.

Since the earliest Quechua dictionaries, &quot;atawallpa&quot; and &quot;wallpa&quot; were offered as the Quechua word for &quot;chicken&quot;. For centuries several historians believed that this Sapa Inca&#x27;s name came from the bird name. Some even translated the name as &quot;happy rooster&quot; or &quot;bird of fortune&quot;. Considering such species was new in the Andes, contemporary scholars believe the etymological direction was the inverse: the bird species may have been named after the monarch, as already said by Blas Valera in the 16th century.

It has been proposed that this person name may have been a compound of two Puquina roots, *&quot;ata-w&quot; &quot;appointed, chosen&quot; and *&quot;wallpa&quot; &quot;diligent or courageous&quot;. However, this analysis is not consensual.

=== Birth ===
There are uncertainties about Atahualpa&#x27;s date and place of birth. He was likely born around the turn of the 16th century, 1502. There is disagreement on his place of birth. Below are the versions of some chroniclers and historians:

The chronicler and soldier Pedro Cieza de León, from his investigations among the members of the Inca nobility of Cusco, affirmed that Atahualpa had been born in Cusco and that his mother was Tuto Palla or Túpac Palla (Quechua names), an &#x27;India Quilaco&#x27; or &#x27;native of Quilaco&#x27;. This demonym could allude to an ethnic group from the province of Quito and would imply that she was a second-class wife belonging to the regional elite. Cieza de León denied that Atahualpa was born in Quito or Caranqui and that his mother was the lady of Quito, as some at the time claimed, since Quito was a province of Tahuantinsuyo when Atahualpa was born. Therefore their kings and lords were the Incas.

According to Juan de Betanzos, Atahualpa was born in Cusco and his mother was a ñusta (Inca princess) from Cusco of the lineage of Inca Yupanqui (Pachacuti).

In the 18th century the priest Juan de Velasco, using as a source a work by Marcos de Niza, whose existence has not been confirmed, compiled information about the Kingdom of Quito (whose existence has not been confirmed either). According to de Velasco, the Kingdom of Quito was made up of the Shyris or Scyris ethnic group and disappeared when it was conquered by the Incas. This work includes a list of the kings of Quito, the last of whom, Cacha Duchicela, would have been the Kuraka (Inca cacique) defeated and killed by the Inca Huayna Cápac. Paccha, the daughter of Cacha Duchicela, would have married Huayna Cápac, and from that union Atahualpa would have been born as a legitimate son. Several historians, such as the Peruvian Raúl Porras Barrenechea and the Ecuadorian Jacinto Jijón y Caamaño, have rejected this version for lack of historical and archaeological foundation.

Most Peruvian historians maintain that, according to the most reliable chronicles (Cieza, Sarmiento and Betanzos, who took their reports firsthand), Atahualpa was born in Cusco and his mother was a princess of Inca lineage. These historians consider that Huáscar&#x27;s side invented the version of Atahualpa&#x27;s Quito origin to show him to the Spanish as a usurper and bastard. They also believe that many chroniclers interpreted the division of the empire between the two sons of Huayna Cápac (Huáscar, the eldest son and legitimate heir; and Atahualpa, the bastard and usurper) according to their European or Western conception of political mores. According to Rostworowski this is wrong because the right to the Inca throne did not depend exclusively on primogeniture or paternal line (because the son of the Inca&#x27;s sister could also be heir) but also practical considerations such as the ability to command.

Ecuadorian historians have conflicting opinions:

* According to Hugo Burgos Guevara, the fact that Topa Yupanqui was born in Vilcashuamán and his son Huayna Capac in Tomebamba seems to indicate that Atahualpa was born in Quito as part of an expansionist policy of the empire and as a way to reinforce a political-religious conquest.
* Other Ecuadorian historians, such as Enrique Ayala Mora, consider it more likely that Atahualpa was born in Caranqui, in the current province of Imbabura, in the Ibarra canton (Ecuador). They base this idea on the chronicles of Fernando de Montesinos and Pedro Cieza de León (although the latter mentions said version to refute it, in favor of the one from Cusco).
* Tamara Estupiñan Viteri, a historian who has published numerous works regarding Atahualpa and his close circle at that time, maintains that he was born in Cusco.

== Childhood and youth ==
Atahualpa spent his childhood with his father in Cusco. At the beginning of his adolescence he went through the Warachikuy, a rite of passage that marked the passage to adulthood.

When Atahualpa was thirteen years old, there was a rebellion in the north of the empire by two peoples from that region, the Caranquis and the Cayambis. Together with his father and his brother, Ninan Cuyuchi marched at the head of the Inca army towards the northern provinces (Quito region). Four governors remained in Cusco, including Huáscar. Atahualpa stayed in Quito with his father for more than ten years, helping him put down rebellions and conquer new lands. For this he had the support of skilled Inca generals, such as Chalcuchímac and Quizquiz. During this period he learned government tasks and gained prestige for the courage he displayed in war actions.

The chroniclers described Atahualpa as someone of &quot;lively reasoning and with great authority&quot;.

== Pre-conquest ==
Throughout the Inca Empire&#x27;s history, each Sapa Inca worked to expand the territory of the empire. When Pachacuti, the 9th Sapa Inca ruled, he expanded the Empire to northern Peru. At this point, Pachacuti sent his son Tupac Inca Yupanqui to invade and conquer the territory of present-day Ecuador. News of the expansion of the Inca reached the different tribes and nations of Ecuador. As a defense against the Inca, the Andean chiefdoms formed alliances with each other.

Around 1460, Tupac Inca Yupanqui, with an army of 200,000 warriors that were sent by his father, easily gained control of the Palta nation in southern Ecuador and northern Peru in a matter of months. However, the Inca army met fierce resistance from the defending Cañari, which left the Incas so impressed that after they were defeated the Cañari were recruited into the Inca army. In northern Ecuador the Inca army met fiercer resistance from an alliance between the Quitus and the Cañari. After defeating them in the battle of Atuntaqui, Tupac Yupanqui sent settlers to what is now the city of Quito and left as governor Chalco Mayta, belonging to the Inca nobility.

Around 1520, the tribes of Quitu, Caras and Puruhá rebelled against the Inca Huayna Cápac. He personally led his army and defeated the rebels in the battle of Laguna de Yahuarcocha where there was such a massacre that the lake turned to blood. According to Juan de Velasco, the alliance of the northern tribes collapsed and finally ended when Huayna Cápac married Paccha Duchicela, queen of the Shyris, making them recognize him as monarch, this marriage was the basis of the alliance that guaranteed the Inca power in the area.

After Huayna Capac died in 1527, Atahualpa was appointed governor of Quito by his brother Huáscar.

== Inca Civil War ==

Huáscar saw Atahualpa as the greatest threat to his power, but did not dethrone him to respect the wishes of his late father. A tense five-year peace ensued, Huáscar took advantage of that time to get the support of the Cañari, a powerful ethnic group that dominated extensive territories of the north of the empire and maintained grudges against Atahualpa, who had fought them during his father&#x27;s campaigns. By 1529 the relationship between both brothers had quite deteriorated. According to the chronicler Pedro Pizarro, Huáscar sent an army to the North, which ambushed Atahualpa in Tumebamba and defeated him. Atahualpa was captured and imprisoned in a &quot;tambo&quot; (roadside shelters built for the Chasqui) but succeeded in escaping. During his time in captivity he was cut and lost an ear. From then on he wore a headpiece that fastened under his chin to hide the injury. But the chronicler Miguel Cabello de Balboa said that this story of capture was improbable because if Atahualpa had been captured by Huáscar&#x27;s forces they would have executed him immediately.

Atahualpa returned to Quito and amassed a great army. He attacked the Cañari of Tumebamba, defeating its defenses and levelling the city and the surrounding lands. He arrived in Tumbes, from which he planned an assault by rafts on the island Puná. During the naval operation, Atahualpa sustained a leg injury and returned to land. Taking advantage of his retreat, the &quot;punaneños&quot; (inhabitants of Puña) attacked Tumbes. They destroyed the city, leaving it in the ruined state recorded by the Spaniards in early 1532.

From Cuzco the Huascarites, led by the armies of general Atoc, defeated Atahualpa in the battle of Chillopampa. The Atahualapite generals responded quickly; they gathered together their scattered troops, counter-attacked and forcefully defeated Atoc in Mulliambato. They captured Atoc and later tortured and killed him.

The Atahualapite forces continued to be victorious, as a result of the strategic abilities of Quizquiz and Chalcuchímac. Atahualpa began a slow advance on Cuzco. While based in Marcahuamachuco, he sent an emissary to consult the oracle of the Huaca (god) Catequil, who prophesied that Atahualpa&#x27;s advance would end poorly. Furious at the prophecy, Atahualpa went to the sanctuary, killed the priest and ordered the temple to be destroyed. During this period, he first learned that Pizarro and his expedition had arrived in the empire.

Atahualpa&#x27;s leading generals were Quizquiz, Chalcuchímac and Rumiñawi. In April 1532, Quizquiz and his companions led the armies of Atahualpa to victory in the battles of Mullihambato, Chimborazo and Quipaipán. The Battle of Quipaipán was the final one between the warring brothers. Quizquiz and Chalcuchimac defeated Huáscar&#x27;s army, captured him, killed his family and seized the capital, Cuzco. Atahualpa had remained behind in the Andean city of Cajamarca, where he encountered the Spanish, led by Pizarro.

== Spanish conquest ==

In January 1531, a Spanish expedition led by Francisco Pizarro, on a mission to conquer the Inca Empire, landed on Puná Island. Pizarro brought with him 180 men and 37 horses. The Spaniards headed south and occupied Tumbes, where they heard about the civil war that Huáscar and Atahualpa were waging against each other. About a year and a half later, in September 1532, after reinforcements had arrived from Spain, Pizarro founded the city of San Miguel de Piura and then marched towards the heart of the Inca Empire with a force of 106 foot-soldiers and 62 horsemen. Atahualpa, in Cajamarca with his army of 80,000 troops, heard that this party of strangers was advancing into the empire and sent an Inca noble to investigate. The noble stayed for two days in the Spanish camp, making an assessment of the Spaniards&#x27; weapons and horses. Atahualpa decided that the 168 Spaniards were not a threat to him and his 80,000 troops, so he sent word inviting them to visit Cajamarca and meet him, expecting to capture them. Pizarro and his men thus advanced unopposed through some very difficult terrain. They arrived at Cajamarca on 15 November 1532.

Atahualpa and his army had camped on a hill just outside Cajamarca. He was staying in a building close to the Konoj hot springs, while his soldiers were in tents set up around him. When Pizarro arrived in Cajamarca, the town was mostly empty except for a few hundred &quot;acllas&quot;. The Spaniards were billeted in certain long buildings on the main square and Pizarro sent an embassy to the Inca, led by Hernando de Soto. The group consisted of 15 horsemen and an interpreter; shortly thereafter de Soto sent 20 more horsemen as reinforcements in case of an Inca attack. These were led by Francisco Pizarro&#x27;s brother, Hernando Pizarro.

The Spaniards invited Atahualpa to visit Cajamarca to meet Pizarro, which he resolved to do the following day. Meanwhile, Pizarro was preparing an ambush to trap the Inca: while the Spanish cavalry and infantry were occupying three long buildings around the square, some musketeers and four pieces of artillery were located in a stone structure in the middle of the square. The plan was to persuade Atahualpa to submit to the authority of the Spaniards and, if this failed, there were two options: a surprise attack, if success seemed possible or to keep up a friendly stance if the Inca forces appeared too powerful.

The following day, Atahualpa left his camp at midday, preceded by a large number of men in ceremonial attire; as the procession advanced slowly, Pizarro sent his brother Hernando to invite the Inca to enter Cajamarca before nightfall. Atahualpa entered the town late in the afternoon in a litter carried by eighty lords; with him were four other lords in litters and hammocks and 5,000–6,000 men carrying small battle axes, slings and pouches of stones underneath their clothes. &quot;He was very drunk from what he had imbibed in the (thermal) baths before leaving as well as what he had taken during the many stops on the road. In each of them he had drunk well. And even there on his litter he requested drink.&quot; The Inca found no Spaniards in the plaza, as they were all inside the buildings. The only man to emerge was the Dominican friar Vincente de Valverde with an interpreter.

Although there are different accounts as to what Valverde said, most agree that he invited the Inca to come inside to talk and dine with Pizarro. Atahualpa instead demanded the return of every thing the Spaniards had taken since they landed. According to eyewitness accounts, Valverde spoke about the Catholic religion but did not deliver the &quot;requerimiento&quot;, a speech requiring the listener to submit to the authority of the Spanish Crown and accept the Christian faith. At Atahualpa&#x27;s request, Valverde gave him his breviary but, after a brief examination, the Inca threw it to the ground; Valverde hurried back toward Pizarro, calling on the Spaniards to attack. At that moment, Pizarro gave the signal; the Spanish infantry and cavalry came out of their hiding places and charged the unsuspecting Inca retinue, killing a great number while the rest fled in panic. Pizarro led the charge on Atahualpa, but captured him only after killing all those carrying him and turning over his litter. Not a single Spanish soldier was killed.
== Captivity and execution ==
On 17 November the Spaniards sacked the Inca army camp, in which they found great treasures of gold, silver and emeralds. Noticing their lust for precious metals, Atahualpa offered to fill a large room about long and wide up to a height of once with gold and twice with silver within two months. It is commonly believed that Atahualpa offered this ransom to regain his freedom, but Hemming says that he did so to save his life. None of the early chroniclers mention any commitment by the Spaniards to free Atahualpa once the metals were delivered.


After several months in fear of an imminent attack from general Rumiñawi, the outnumbered Spanish considered Atahualpa to be too much of a liability and decided to execute him. Pizarro staged a mock trial and found Atahualpa guilty of revolting against the Spanish, practicing idolatry and murdering Huáscar, his brother. Atahualpa was sentenced to death by burning at the stake. Atahualpa questioned Pizarro and asked to be sent for ransom to the Spanish throne because his people were under attack and he positioned himself in abdicating his throne at the Inca. He offered gold for his life, and at the stake he died with his own honor.

On the morning of his death, Atahualpa was interrogated by his Spanish captors about his birthplace. Atahualpa declared that his birthplace was in what the Incas called the Kingdom of Quito, in a place called Caranqui (today located 2 km southeast of Ibarra, Ecuador). Most chroniclers agree, though other stories suggest various other birthplaces.

In accordance with his request, he was executed by strangling with a garrote on 26 July 1533. His clothes and some of his skin were burned and his remains were given a Christian burial. Atahualpa was succeeded by his brother Túpac Huallpa and, later, by another brother, Manco Inca.

== Legacy ==
After the death of Pizarro, Inés Yupanqui, Atahualpa&#x27;s favorite sister, who had been given to Pizarro in marriage by her brother, married a Spanish knight named Ampuero and left for Spain. They took her daughter by Pizarro with them and she was later legitimized by imperial decree. Francisca Pizarro Yupanqui married her uncle Hernando Pizarro in Spain, on 10 October 1537—they had a son, Francisco Pizarro y Pizarro. The Pizarro line survived Hernando&#x27;s death, although it is extinct in the male line. Among Inés&#x27;s direct descendants, having Inca royal ancestry, at least three governed Latin American nations during the 19th and early 20th centuries: Dominican President José Desiderio Valverde and Bolivian Presidents Pedro José Domingo de Guerra and Jose Gutierrez Guerra. Pizarro&#x27;s third son, by a relative of Atahualpa renamed Angelina, who was never legitimized, died shortly after reaching Spain. Another relative, Catalina Capa-Yupanqui, who died in 1580, married a Portuguese nobleman named António Ramos, son of António Colaço. Their daughter was Francisca de Lima who married Álvaro de Abreu de Lima, who was also a Portuguese nobleman.

In Quito, the most important football stadium is named Estadio Atahualpa after Atahualpa.

On the façade of the Royal Palace of Madrid there is a statue of the Inca emperor Atahualpa, along with another of the Aztec emperor Moctezuma II, among the statues of the kings of the ancient kingdoms that formed Spain.

=== Inkarri ===

A myth concerning Atahualpa&#x27;s death and future resurrection became widespread among indigenous groups, with versions of the tale being documented as far as among the Huilliche people of southern Chile. A rare version recorded by Tom Dillehay among the Mapuche of Araucanía tells of Atahualpa killing Pedro de Valdivia.

== Remains ==
The burial site of Atahualpa is unknown but historian Tamara Estupiñán argues it lies somewhere in modern-day Ecuador. She argues he was buried in Ecuador for safekeeping. The location is named Malqui-Machay, Quechua for ‘mummy’, and stone walls and trapezoidal underground water canals have been found in this location. More serious archaeological excavation needs to be done to confirm Estupiñán&#x27;s beliefs.

== In popular culture ==
A treasure hunt for Atahualpa&#x27;s gold forms the basis for the second Biggles book, &quot;The Cruise of the Condor&quot;. Atahualpa Inca&#x27;s conflict with Pizarro was dramatized by Peter Shaffer in his play &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot;, first staged by the National Theatre in 1964 at the Chichester Festival, then in London at the Old Vic. The role of Atahualpa was played by Robert Stephens and by David Carradine, who received a Theatre World Award in the 1965 Broadway production. Christopher Plummer portrayed Atahualpa in the 1969 movie version of the play. The closing track of Tyrannosaurus Rex&#x27;s debut album, &quot;My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... But Now They&#x27;re Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows&quot;, was entitled ‘Frowning Atahuallpa (My Inca Love)’.

Atahaulpa plays a key role in Laurent Binet&#x27;s 2019 alternate history novel &quot;Civilizations&quot;, journeying across the Atlantic and going on to conquer much of Europe.

<text>Lörrach () is a city in southwest Germany, in the valley of the Wiese, close to the French and the Swiss borders. It is the district seat of the district of Lörrach in Baden-Württemberg. It is the home of a number of large employers, including the Milka chocolate factory owned by Mondelez International. The city population has grown over the last century; with only 10,794 in 1905, it has now increased its population to over 50,000.

Nearby is the castle of Rötteln on the Wiesental, whose lords became the counts of Hachberg and a residence of the Margraves of Baden; this was destroyed by the troops of Louis XIV in 1678, but was rebuilt in 1867. Lörrach received market rights in 1403, but it did not obtain the privileges of a city until 1682.

After the Napoleonic epoch, the town was included in the Grand Duchy of Baden. On 21 September 1848, Gustav Struve attempted to start a revolutionary uprising in Lörrach as part of the Revolutions of 1848–49. It failed, and Struve was caught and imprisoned. Still, Lörrach was officially the capital of Germany for a day.

==Geography==
Lörrach is located in the southernmost part of the Rhine Rift valley. The depression is created by tectonic movements, and the area has a high earthquake risk.
Several times a year, Lörrach is afflicted by slight and medial earthquakes.

The city is located in a valley of the Quaternary period. Lörrach is surrounded by slopes on two sides. The slopes create the southern part of the Wiesental, that is the valley where the Wiese river flows.

Geographical locations of the subdistrict Lörrach:
* Elevation of the lowest place: 272 m (in the valley &quot;Wiesental&quot; at the border with Switzerland)
* Elevation of the highest place: 570 m (in the forest of &quot;Rötteln&quot;)

The extent of the urban area from south to north is 6.0 km and from east to west 4.6 km. Lörrach is also the capital city of Markgräflerland and a part of the tri-national agglomeration area of Basel (Switzerland). Stuttgart is 220 km away from Lörrach, and it takes one hour to drive to Bern or Zürich. The city has several forested hills along the valley Wiesental: Schädelberg, Homburg, Röttler Wald, and Tüllinger Berg.

Lörrach is bounded by many municipalities and the city of Riehen (Switzerland). In addition, it is located in the foothills of the Black Forest and on the border of Switzerland.
===Climate===
Lörrach&#x27;s climate is mild, and in the summer, it is often hot. The region of Markgräflerland is the warmest in Germany because of the Mediterranean air current from the valley of the Rhône. Because of its numerous sunny days, the region is dubbed the German Tuscany (German: &quot;Die Toskana Deutschlands&quot;).

===Boroughs and districts===

Lörrach is subdivided into three boroughs and three districts. In sum, the three boroughs have an area of 18.6 km2.

The three districts have their own administrations with a chief magistrate (&quot;Ortsvorsteher&quot;). Every five years, the citizens of Lörrach elect the council of the districts. The satellite city Salzert was developed in 1963. Inzlingen, close to Lörrach, is an independent municipality, but Lörrach oversees its administration.

==History==
===Population development===


===Coat of arms===

Lörrach received its city rights in 1682 when it became the capital of the Oberamt Rötteln-Sausenberg. At the same time, its arms were granted. The arms show a canting lark (&quot;Lerche&quot;). In 1756, both the city rights and the arms were regranted by Margrave Charles Frederick of Baden. The colours are also the colours of Baden. Even though the arms have not changed since, the shape and size of the lark have changed considerably. The present arms have been used since the early 1960s and show a very modern variation of the lark. After municipal reforms, the coat of arms was reconfirmed on 11 November 1975.

===Religion===

Christianity

Lörrach initially belonged to the diocese of Konstanz and was under the archdiocese of Breisgau. In 1529, after the Reformation had been introduced there, the parsonage of Lörrach was occupied from Basel. The reformation in the city was introduced in 1556. After that, Lörrach was for many centuries a predominantly Protestant city. In Rötteln, an archdiocese had existed since the beginning of the 15th century, which at the end of the 17th century, shifted to Lörrach. The Protestant pastor of Lörrach was from 1682 an intendant, too. The &quot;Stadtkirche&quot; is the main church of Lörrach (first mentioned in the 12th century). In addition, Lörrach has a few parishes: &quot;Johannespfarrei&quot; (founded in the 20th century), &quot;Pauluspfarrei&quot; for the northern city (founded in 1906), &quot;Matthäuspfarrei&quot; for the eastern city, Inzlingen (founded in 1949), &quot;Markuspfarrei&quot; (founded in 1956), Salzertgemeinde (founded in 1969), and &quot;Friedensgemeinde&quot; for the district of Homburg (founded in 1974).

The borough of Stetten was controlled by Austria until 1803. Therefore, Stetten has a Catholic tradition, although the Reformation had been introduced years before. Because of a contract with Austria, Stetten again became Catholic. At first, the parish of Stetten also served the resident Catholics of Lörrach. They held their church services in the new church, the &quot;Fridolinskirche&quot; (1822). The original church of Stettens was founded in the 13th century. Between 1864 and 1867 in Lörrach, its own parish church (St. Bonifatius) was built, at which a curacy was created that was raised to the status of a parsonage in 1882. A second Catholic church (St. Peter) was built in 1964. In Brombach, they had already built in 1900 a church (St. Josephskirche), which has been a parsonage since 1911. All Catholic parishes of Lörrach today form together with the neighbouring parishes of St. Peter and Paul in Inzlingen a group pastoral ministry within the deanery of Wiesental belonging to the archbishopric Freiburg.

Today, the Lutheran denomination has a slight predominance in the city. In the borough of Stetten exists a relative Catholic majority.

Beside the two large churches, some parishes belong to free churches; for example, the &quot;Freie evangelische Gemeinde&quot; or &quot;FeG Lörrach&quot; (English: Free Evangelical community).

<doc id="453785" wikidata="Q6811116" url="?curid=453785" title="William Saunders (botanist)">
<text>William Saunders (December 7, 1822 – September 11, 1900) was a horticulturist, landscape designer, and nurseryman. He was one of the first landscape architects employed by the federal government, spending thirty-eight years with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He was also a founder of the National Grange or Patrons of Husbandry. During his career, Saunders designed the Soldiers&#x27; National Cemetery at Gettysburg, planned and developed the Washington, D.C., park system, introduced numerous new plant species to the United States, and authored many articles on horticulture. 

==Early life==
William Saunders was born on December 7, 1822, in St. Andrews, Scotland. In 1834, he enrolled at Madras College in St. Andrews, where he developed an interest in horticulture and landscape gardening. He studied horticulture at the University of Edinburgh and later received practical training at Kew Gardens. He also worked as an apprentice gardener on several large estates in London. Saunders married Martha Mildwaters in 1848 and emigrated to the United States, becoming an American citizen in 1857.

Saunders initially worked as a gardener on the estate of William Bostwick in New Haven, Connecticut. In the 1850s, he moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where he was employed on the estate of Johns Hopkins. In addition to managing the estate farm, Saunders designed landscape features, including large lakes and various flower gardens. 

During this time, Saunders began writing articles on horticultural topics, which were published in journals such as &quot;The Horticulturalist&quot;, &quot;Hovey&#x27;s Magazine of Horticulture&quot;, &quot;The Farmer and Gardener&quot;, and &quot;The Philadelphia Florist&quot;. Many of his contributions provided practical advice on propagating fruit trees and grapevines.

In 1854, Saunders partnered with horticulturalist Thomas Meehan, whom he had met while working together at Kew Gardens. Together, they established a nursery and collaborated on several public park projects, cemeteries, and residential site plans. Saunders&#x27; cemetery designs included Rose Hill Cemetery in Chicago and Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, Illinois. He also developed plans for cemeteries in Perth Amboy, Rahway, New Jersey, and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

==Department of Agriculture==
In 1862, Saunders was hired as the superintendent of the experimental gardens at the newly created Department of Agriculture, where he worked for the rest of his life. At the time, the organization was called the Bureau of Agriculture and did not achieve cabinet status until 1889. During his thirty-eight-year career, Saunders made significant contributions to landscape design and horticulture. 

===Landscape design===
In 1863, Saunders was selected by a committee of Union governors to design the Soldiers&#x27; National Cemetery in Gettysburg. Saunders laid out the cemetery on a radial plan centered around a central monument, grouping the Union dead by state. The graves were marked with simple, rectangular slabs of gray granite inscribed with the name, rank, and company of each soldier. He explained that this repetition of &quot;objects in themselves simple and commonplace&quot; was intended to evoke a sense of &quot;solemnity.&quot; Around the cemetery, Saunders framed the site with extensive plantings, using uncommon varieties of trees and shrubs, many of which he had recently introduced to America. This combination of simplicity and extensive green landscaping was a novel approach to cemetery design, unprecedented in Europe or the United States. 

Before Lincoln left for Gettysburg to deliver his famous address, he met with Saunders to review the cemetery design. Saunders later wrote, &quot;He [Lincoln] was much pleased with the method of the graves, saying it differed from the ordinary cemetery, and after I had explained the reasons, said it was an admirable and befitting arrangement.&quot;

In 1865, after Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, Saunders was asked to design the landscape for a Lincoln monument at Oak Ridge Cemetery, the same cemetery he had originally planned in 1861. His design featured large open areas of lawn and irregular groupings of non-native trees, including magnolias, arborvitae, and mock orange.

Saunders also designed the landscaping for the west facade of the Capitol and other significant locations in the federal capital. As president of the Washington Parking Commission, he developed city parks and implemented an ambitious program of planting street trees. He oversaw the planting of 80,000 trees, earning the city its reputation as the &quot;City of Trees.&quot;

===Horticulture===
Saunders was appointed head of the newly created United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Experimental Gardens in 1862 and remained in the position until his death in 1900. He defined the mission of the organization and established its operating guidelines in his &quot;Catalogue of the Plants, Bulbs, Tubers, Etc., for Distribution from the U.S. Propagating Garden with a Report on the Objectives and Aims of the Garden&quot; (1862). This was the USDA&#x27;s first publication.

His guidelines called for the USDA to procure new and better plants for the country and &quot;ascertain, by experiment, the influences of varied culture&quot; and &quot;investigate more thoroughly the various maladies and diseases of plants and the insects that destroy them.&quot;

For example, between 1865 and 1867, the USDA Experimental Garden evaluated more than 120 wheats, 167 ryes, 230 melon varieties, 70 peas, 50 grass species for hay production, and over 500 strawberries, grapes, apples, and pears. The results of this work were published and made available to farmers.

Using this experimental approach, Saunders introduced hundreds of economically important plants, including the Japanese persimmon, the &quot;Eucalyptus globulus&quot; tree, the Japanese cedar (&quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot;), the camphor tree, one of the first magnolia trees in Washington, D.C., and many others. About 300 varieties of winter-hardy apples from Russia were evaluated and introduced into the U.S., significantly improving apple production in the Northeast. In 1866, Tappahannock wheat was identified in the evaluation program as a superior variety, noted for its high yields, early maturity, disease resistance, and flour quality. The &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote on April 26, 1873, that for the &quot;wheat crop in 1862... the average yield per acre was 12.1 bushels. With Tappahannock wheat distributed by the department, the average yield per acre was twenty-five bushels.&quot;

The navel orange was Saunders&#x27; most acclaimed plant introduction. In 1871, he received a dozen young orange trees from Bahia, Brazil. The fruit was described as large, sweet, and seedless. Saunders presented two of the trees to an old friend, Eliza Tibbets, who moved to Riverside, California. The trees thrived in the California climate, and orchards of this new citrus variety became widespread in Southern California. According to the 1937 &quot;USDA Yearbook of Agriculture,&quot; the introduction of what became known as the Washington navel orange was considered &quot;one of the outstanding events in the economic and social development of California.&quot;

===Grange===
Saunders supported the interests and economic welfare of American farmers. In 1867, he and six colleagues founded the National Grange, an organization dedicated to promoting the economic and political well-being of agriculture and rural communities. Saunders authored the Grange&#x27;s constitution and was elected its first Master, a position he held for six years. During his tenure, Saunders was a strong advocate for women&#x27;s participation and representation in the organization.

==Works==
During his lifetime, Saunders published hundreds of articles on horticulture, agriculture, and landscape design. Some of his notable works include:

*Journal, 1898. United States Department of Agriculture Library, Washington, D.C. This unpublished handwritten journal by Saunders is the most detailed primary source dealing with Saunders&#x27; career with the Department of Agriculture, the background of the Soldiers&#x27; National Cemetery, and his design ideas for Washington, D.C.
*&quot;Landscape Gardening.&quot; The Report of the Commission of Agriculture for the Year 1869. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office. An important source concerning Saunders&#x27; understanding of the history and nature of landscape gardening.
*&quot;Landscape Decorative and Economic Gardening.&quot; In &quot;City Homes, Country Houses and Church Architecture or the American Builders&#x27; Journal&quot;, by Samuel Sloan. Philadelphia, PA: Claxton, Remsen, and Haffelfinger; 1871. In this series, Saunders reaffirms many of the ideas expressed in &quot;Landscape Gardening&quot; and develops some of them further.
*&quot;Remarks on the Design for the Soldiers&#x27; National Cemetery, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.&quot; Revised Report Made to the Legislature of Pennsylvania Relative to the Soldiers&#x27; National Cemetery at Gettysburg. Harrisburg, PA: Singerly and Myers, State Printers. This is the definitive statement of Saunders&#x27; design concept for his most important cemetery commission.

<doc id="453787" wikidata="Q7766287" url="?curid=453787" title="The Star Trek Encyclopedia">
<text>The Star Trek Encyclopedia: A Reference Guide to the Future is a 1994 encyclopedia of in-universe information from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series and films. It was written by Michael Okuda and Denise Okuda, who were production staff on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; and Debbie Mirek. It was illustrated by Doug Drexler.

==Overview==
The &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; features highly detailed information about characters, planets, technologies and ships of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise as well as brief episode and film synopses. It is organised alphabetically and is replete with illustrations, many of which are in color in later editions.

The &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; mostly covers material from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series and the &quot;Star Trek&quot; motion pictures. It is an officially licensed publication and includes some completely original information not included in any &quot;Star Trek&quot; movie or television episode. According to Gene Roddenberry, television series and the films are the extent of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; canon.

Some entries in the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; contain behind-the-scenes information, presented in italicized text.

Unlike the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual&quot;, the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; makes no detailed speculations about &quot;Star Trek&quot; technology.

==Publication history==
The &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; was inspired by a previous book by the same writing team, &quot;The Star Trek Chronology&quot;, which had been directly commissioned by Gene Roddenberry as a way of ensuring continuity on &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Michael Okuda developed a &quot;worksheet&quot; on which to record episode titles, episode production numbers, stardates, and any new ships, characters or technology.

Four print editions have been published to date, in both hardcover and paperback: the first edition () was published in 1994; the second (ISBN ) in 1997. The third edition (ISBN ), published in 1999, includes material through the end of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, the fifth season of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, and the movie &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot;—but as a non-collated addendum. The fourth edition () was published in 2016.

The print version was complemented by a similar electronic version, the &quot;Star Trek Omnipedia&quot; released in 1995. The CD-ROM medium allowed the Simon &amp; Schuster publishers to include video clips.
It was released for both Windows and Macintosh (ISBN ), which was published by Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive. This was the only version of the encyclopedia not to be published by Pocket Books. Paramount Pictures is the owner of the copyright.

==Fourth edition==
In the years since its 1999 publication, the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; gradually became extremely out of date, containing no information from subsequent &quot;Star Trek&quot; films (&quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;), the last two seasons of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; or &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. There had long been no plans to release an updated version of the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;, as it had been superseded by online resources such as the wiki-based encyclopedia Memory Alpha.

During the August 2015 annual &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention in Las Vegas, an updated version of the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; was announced for publication in 2016, the 50th Anniversary of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The total pages for this updated version is 1,056 pages. It was announced that the updated version would have &quot;300 new pages&quot; and cover &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; Seasons 4–7, &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; Seasons 1–4, &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; and would contain information regarding J.J. Abrams&#x27; &quot;Star Trek&quot; movie reboot. The version came out as a &quot;two-volume hardcover edition&quot;. The 2016 revised edition was published by Harper Design on October 18, 2016, for $150.

Denise Okuda stated that there is &quot;two, maybe three times as much text in the 2016 edition as in the original, and way more than three times as many photos and illustrations.&quot;

<text>Big Tex is a tall figure and marketing icon of the annual State Fair of Texas held at Fair Park in Dallas, Texas, United States. The figure has become a cultural icon of Dallas and Texas. Since 1952, Big Tex has served as a cultural ambassador to visitors, and the figure&#x27;s prime location in the fairgrounds serves as a traditional meeting point.

On October 19, 2012, the last weekend of the 2012 State Fair of Texas, Big Tex was destroyed by an electrical fire that started in the right boot and worked its way up the structure, first becoming visible from the neck area. After the fire, a new Big Tex was created by SRO Associates and Texas Scenic Co. This rendition made its first public appearance on September 26, 2013.

Big Tex donned a mask in September 2020 while the fair was on hiatus because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==History==
===Origins===
Kerens, Texas is known as the &quot;Birthplace of Big Tex,” although his original incarnation was as a 49-foot (15 m) tall Santa Claus constructed from iron drill casing, papier mache, and unraveled rope in 1949. The statue was an idea of Howell Brister, manager of the Chamber of Commerce, to encourage holiday sales in the town, and the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Santa Claus&quot; (a claim later disputed) stood over Colket Avenue for two holiday seasons — drawing press attention from as far away as Iran and Australia. Modeled after Kerens residents Ottis Franklin Spurlock and Hardy Mayo, the figure was built by members of the community who welded the frame, fabricated the body and sewed the clothing.

After two seasons, the excitement over the statue faded, and Kerens offered it up for sale. In 1951, State Fair president R. L. Thornton purchased Santa&#x27;s components for $750 and had artist Jack Bridges transform them into a cowboy, giving birth to &quot;Big Tex.”

===1952 to 2012===
Big Tex made his debut at the 1952 fair, a 52-foot cowboy dressed in denim jeans and a plaid shirt donated by the H. D. Lee Company, then based in Shawnee Mission, Kansas. Artist Jack Bridges used a photograph of his own face, a photograph of rancher Doc Simmons and a photograph of Will Rogers to create the new look. After the fair, his appearance was slightly altered to straighten his nose and correct an odd wink. It was in 1953 that Big Tex also began speaking. Using a custom-built recipromotor and a 75-watt speaker system housed in the figure&#x27;s head, Jack Bridges devised a way to create the illusion of natural speech with a swinging jaw. Tex also attended a convention in Minneapolis that year with the Dallas Jaycees.

In 1955, Big Tex received his first new change of clothes, again fabricated by the H. D. Lee Company. After that year&#x27;s fair, he traveled to West Texas to participate in Abilene Christian College&#x27;s 50th annual homecoming celebration. A 12-foot-tall, 19-foot long plastic model of a Hereford steer (called &quot;The Champ&quot;) accompanied Big Tex for the 1956 fair, but Big Tex was primarily displayed alone. During the 1950s Big Tex underwent further re-design, replacing the papier mache &quot;skin&quot; with fiberglass. The original head was put into storage and later sold at auction in 1993 to a Dallas collector.

The State Fair of Texas announced the construction of a permanent, year-round statue of Big Tex in 1961, but the figure remained a seasonal feature appearing only during the fair. Instead, the Big Tex Circle display area was redesigned in 1966 with a larger mound.

Big Tex traveled to his hometown of Kerens, Texas in 1981 to help celebrate the 100th anniversary of the city. The figure continued to travel to various promotional events until the mid-1980s.

In 1997, Big Tex was given a skeletal makeover consisting of 4,200 feet of steel rods weighing 6,000 pounds. The new skeleton adjusted the posture and allowed for a new hand that waved to passersby, but kept the original head. Three years later his neck was animated, allowing it to turn; his mechanical mouth was also upgraded with a new system.

Big Tex celebrated his 50th birthday in 2002, receiving a giant birthday cake and an AARP card. Shades of gray were added to the hair and wrinkles were added to the figure&#x27;s hands and face as Big Tex continued to &quot;age.” In 2012, the State Fair of Texas celebrated Big Tex&#x27;s 60th birthday.

==Destruction and recreation==

On the morning of October 19, 2012, (the final weekend of the 2012 State Fair of Texas, and on Big Tex&#x27;s 60th birthday) a fire started inside the framework of Big Tex. The figure&#x27;s clothing, face and hat were completely destroyed in minutes as onlookers watched. An official investigation determined that the fire started in an electrical panel under the attraction&#x27;s right boot. This panel was believed to have powered the air compressor that kept the clothing of the statue inflated.

News of the fire received national attention, and fair officials committed to rebuilding Big Tex &quot;bigger and better&quot; in time for the 2013 fair.

Working under secrecy, a new Big Tex was created during 2013 by SRO Associates and Texas Scenic Co. at a cost of $500,000. The recreated statue weighs more than the previous version, bringing him to . This allows Big Tex to withstand winds without needing support wires as in previous versions. The height was increased by to tall. Big Tex Circle, the location during the State Fair of Texas, was also enlarged and reinforced for the larger statue.

== Clothing ==
Big Tex generally receives a new shirt and jeans triennially, currently designed and fabricated by the Williamson-Dickie Manufacturing Company. His clothes were last replaced in 2022. 

Prior to 2013, Big Tex wore size 70 boots, a 75-gallon hat, a size 100 180/181 shirt made from nylon awning fabric and 284W/185L 5X pair of Dickies jeans. The pants alone required of denim and weigh in at . Over the years the outfit was accessorized with other articles associated with that year&#x27;s State Fair of Texas theme. Big Tex has suffered a few garment mishaps over the years. In 1961, Hurricane Carla&#x27;s winds tore his clothes. In 1970, his huge shirt was stolen from a pickup truck and received much publicity.

The recreated structure for Big Tex that appeared in 2013 required new clothing and larger sizes. The new Dickie shirt features a 14-foot collar, 23-foot sleeves and weighs . The shirt is made from of awning material. The new Dickie jeans features a 27-foot waist, 22-foot inseam and weighs . The jeans are made from of denim material.

==Voices of Big Tex==
Big Tex welcomes fairgoers with his friendly drawl of &quot;HOOOOOOWDEEEEE, FOOOOOOLKS!!!&quot; and makes regular announcements throughout the duration of the State Fair of Texas. His booming voice has been played by only a few men over six decades, who perform every day of the fair from a booth known as the &quot;doghouse.”

Al Jones, a disc jockey for WRR FM 101.1, was the first voice of Big Tex, and would fill the role until the fair ended in 1955. Radio announcer Jim Lowe, the most well-known voice of Big Tex, began performing his voice in 1956. He continued to provide his voice up until 1982 when he departed from the role for unknown reasons, in which Bob Sonnemaker stepped into the role for the next four years. Lowe would then resume voicing him again in 1987, he continued to provide his voice for eleven more years until his retirement after the 1998 State Fair, due to health issues.

After Lowe&#x27;s retirement, Dan Alexander would step up for the next two years as Big Tex&#x27;s voice, from 1999 to 2000. In 2001 a statewide competition and contest, held live at the Cotton Bowl, announced Sonny Ray Stolz as the next voice of Big Tex. But after only one season, Sonny decided not to continue due to what he considered unprofessional treatment by Fair officials and the Fair brought in runner-up Bill Bragg in 2002.

After the 2012 State Fair, Bragg was fired from the role after breaking the State Fair rules for revealing himself as the voice of Big Tex during a charity event, the Fair officially chose not to renew his contract. In 2013, Bob Boykin began voicing Big Tex, he would continue to voice him for a total of six years up until the 2019 State Fair. As of 2021, Big Tex has received a new voice performer, but the performer&#x27;s name remains anonymously unknown at this time.

The voice of the 1955 Big Tex (Al Jones) can be heard on the recording of NBC&#x27;s live &quot;Wide Wide World&quot; which includes multiple segments at the State Fair.

<text>Ralph Nelson (August 12, 1916 – December 21, 1987) was an American film and television director, producer, writer, and actor. He was best known for directing &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot; (1963), &quot;Father Goose&quot; (1964), and &quot;Charly&quot; (1968), films which won Academy Awards.

==Life and career==
Nelson was born in Long Island City, New York. He served in the U.S. Army Air Corps as a fighter pilot and flight instructor during World War II.

Before the war ended, he had a play on Broadway: &quot;The Wind Is Ninety&quot; ran from June to September 1945. Kirk Douglas was in the cast.

Nelson directed the acclaimed episode &quot;A World of His Own&quot; of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (he should not be confused with &quot;The Twilight Zone&#x27;s&quot; production manager, Ralph W. Nelson). He also directed both the television and film versions of Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight.&quot;

He directed &quot;Charly,&quot; the 1968 film version of &quot;Flowers for Algernon,&quot; for which Cliff Robertson won an Academy Award, as well as several racially provocative films in the 1960s and early 1970s, including the Academy Award-winning &quot;Lilies of the Field,&quot; &quot;...tick...tick...tick...&quot;, &quot;Christmas Lilies of the Field,&quot; &quot;The Wilby Conspiracy,&quot; and &quot;Soldier Blue.&quot; The starring role in &quot;Lilies&quot; led to Sidney Poitier winning the Academy Award for Best Actor.

Nelson also directed the Cary Grant comedy &quot;Father Goose,&quot; the offbeat &quot;Soldier in the Rain&quot; with Jackie Gleason and Steve McQueen, the crime story &quot;Once a Thief,&quot; and Rita Hayworth&#x27;s last film, &quot;The Wrath of God.&quot; He both directed, and briefly appeared in, &quot;Duel at Diablo,&quot; starring James Garner and Sidney Poitier.

Nelson&#x27;s other credits include several episodes of TV&#x27;s &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch,&quot; the &#x27;70s camp horror classic &quot;Embryo,&quot; and &quot;A Hero Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; but a Sandwich.&quot;

A television drama about mounting the live show of &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot; called &quot;The Man in the Funny Suit&quot; was made in 1960, with Nelson both writing and directing. Nelson, Serling, Red Skelton, Keenan Wynn and Ed Wynn appeared in it as themselves.

He returned to TV in the late 1970s with a string of TV movies, including a sequel to &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot; called Christmas Lilies of the Field which starred Billy Dee Williams, Maria Schell, and Fay Hauser.

==Death==
He died in 1987 in Santa Monica, California at the age of 71.

<text>Thomas Struth (born 11 October 1954) is a German photographer who is best known for his &quot;Museum Photographs&quot; series, black and white photographs of the streets of Düsseldorf and New York taken in the 1970s, and his family photographs series. Struth lives and works between Berlin and New York.

==Early life and education==
Born to ceramic potter Gisela Struth and bank director Heinrich Struth in Geldern, Germany, Struth trained at the Düsseldorf Academy from 1973 until 1980 where he initially studied painting under Peter Kleemann and, from 1974, Gerhard Richter. Increasingly drawn to photography and with Richter&#x27;s support, Struth, along with Candida Höfer, Axel Hütte, and Tata Ronkholz, joined the first year of the new photography class run by Bernd and Hilla Becher, in 1976. 

==Work==
In 1976, as part of a student exhibition at the Academy, Struth first showed a grid composed of 49 photographs taken from a centralized perspective on Düsseldorf&#x27;s deserted streets, each of them obeying a strict logic of central symmetry. The compositions are simple and the photographs are neither staged nor digitally manipulated in post-production. Strong contrasts of light and shade are also avoided, Struth preferring the greyish, uninflected light of early morning. This serves to enhance the neutral treatment of the scenes.

In 1977, Struth and Hütte travelled to England for two months, and teamed up to photograph different aspects of housing in the urban context of East London. In 1978 Struth was the first artist in residence at P.S. 1 Studios, Long Island City. In 1979 Struth travelled to Paris to visit Thomas Schütte, a fellow student at the Kunstakademie, and continued his photographs of cityscapes. He went on to produce similar series in Rome (1984), Edinburgh (1985), Tokyo (1986), and elsewhere. These early works largely consisted of black-and-white shots of streets. Skyscrapers were another feature of his work, with many of his photographs attempting to show the relationship people have with their modern-day environment.

In the mid-1980s, Struth added a new dimension to his work when he started to produce family portraits, some of which are in colour and others in black and white. This was after a meeting with psychoanalyst Ingo Hartmann. As a result, these works attempt to show the underlying social dynamics within a seemingly still photograph.

In 1989, Struth began work on his best-known cycle, &quot;Museum Photographs&quot;, devoted to the visitors to some of the world&#x27;s great museums and buildings, including The Art Institute of Chicago, the Musée du Louvre in Paris, the Accademia in Venice, and the Pantheon in Rome. Expanding the practice after living in Naples and Rome at the end of the 1980s, he also photographed visitors of churches. From 1998 on, Struth expanded the series with images shot on sites of powerful secular significance (including Times Square and the Yosemite National Park). His pictures of the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, taken between 1996 and 2001, comprise the first series of Museum Photographs dedicated entirely to a single museum with architectural and sculptural works from classical antiquity, including the famous Pergamon Altar and the market gate of Milet. After several unsuccessful attempts to make works based on candid shots of visitors at the Pergamon Museum, in 2001 he decided to orchestrate the positioning of participants in a series of photos. Struth&#x27;s &quot;Museo del Prado&quot; series from 2005, composed of five photographs taken over the course of one week, all shot from slightly different angles, of visitors flocking around Velázquez&#x27;s &quot;Las Meninas.&quot; Also in 2005, he began producing a second series consisting of close-ups of spectators of a single work at the Hermitage in St. Petersburg. Here the spectators are the central object of the photograph, while the artwork itself remains outside the frame. By including in his photographs people who are looking at art, &quot;Struth makes viewers ... aware of their own active participation in the completion of the work&#x27;s meaning, not as passive consumers but as re-interpreters of the past.&quot;

Basing himself in Düsseldorf, Struth&#x27;s profile continued to expand in the 1990s. Between 1998 and 2006, Struth began scouring the earth for jungle settings in Japan, Australia, China, America and Europe; his first eight large-format &quot;Pictures from Paradise&quot; were created in 1998 in the Daintree Rainforest in Australia. Between 1995 and 2003, he produced a series of photographs featuring groups of people gathered at emblematic locations, whether as tourists or as pilgrims. 

Again created throughout Asia, Europe and the Americas, mural-sized colour photographs of 2010 that are up to 4 metres long record the structural intricacy of remote techno-industrial and scientific research spaces, such as physics institutes, pharmaceutical plants, space stations, dockyards, nuclear facilities and other edifices of technological production. In 2014, Struth presented a series of pictures in which he again penetrates key places of human imagination to scrutinize the landscape of enterprise, invention and digital engineering. Taking an archetypal site for the creation of cultural dreams and imagination, one group of pictures depicts panoramic views of Disneyland and Disney California Adventure (devoid of crowds), partly inspired by Katja Eichinger’s 2008 article in the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; about the altered perspective and reading of the theme parks since their beginnings in the 1950s. For his most recent work, &quot;Animals&quot; (2017–2018), Struth worked at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW) in Berlin, following researchers in biology and veterinary medicine in their study of wildlife diversity and conservation.

Meanwhile, Struth continues to add to his collection of family portraits. In 2002, Gerhard Richter asked Struth to make a family portrait for an article on Richter&#x27;s work in the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot;. In 2011, he was commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery to make a double portrait of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh.

From 1993 to 1996, Struth was the first Professor of Photography at the Staatliche Hochschule für Gestaltung in Karlsruhe, Germany. In 2007, he was an artist in residence at the Atlantic Center for the Arts. Between 2010 and 2011, he served as Humanitas Visiting Professor in Contemporary Art at Oxford University.

==Exhibitions==
Struth&#x27;s work has been widely shown in solo and group exhibitions, among them the 44th Venice Biennale (1990) and Documenta IX (1992) at Kassel. His first solo show outside of Germany took place at Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh in 1987. In 1988, Struth exhibited in the group show &quot;Another Objectivity&quot;, organized by the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, which sought to define a current of research born in Germany in the wake of the Bechers’ work. Struth later had his first solo exhibition in the U.S. at The Renaissance Society in Chicago in 1990. Following the anthological exhibitions held in 2002 at the Dallas Museum of Art and the MOCA in Los Angeles, in 2003 his work was presented at the Great Hall of the Metropolitan Museum, with the screening of the video &quot;One Hour Video Portraits&quot; of portraits on which Struth had been working since 1996. The centre of the exhibition was the &quot;Museum&quot; series, which featured seemingly ordinary shots of people entering churches, museums and other public places. In 2007, he became the first contemporary artist ever to be exhibited at the Museo del Prado, Madrid, among the permanent collection of old masters.

In 2010, a European retrospective of his work, &quot;Thomas Struth: Photographs 1978–2010&quot; was held at Kunsthaus Zürich, later traveling to Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen K20, Düsseldorf; Whitechapel Gallery, London; and Museu Serralves, Porto.

==Personal life==
In a 2004 interview with &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, Struth publicly criticized art collector Friedrich Christian Flick for not contributing to the Foundation Remembrance, Responsibility and Future, a government fund for slave laborers and their families; Flick later made a payment of 5 million euros.

In 2007, Struth married author Tara Bray Smith in New York.

<text>Francis Marion McDowell (June 12, 1831 – March 22, 1894) was an American banker and farmer and a co-founder of the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, a fraternal organization in the United States.

==Biography==
Francis Marion McDowell was born in Wayne, New York, in 1831, of British ancestry, his four grandparents being Scotch, English, Irish and Welsh. In addition to the common schools at Wayne, he was educated at the institution which has since become Alfred University, in Alfred, New York, and for a time he taught school in his hometown.

He later became partner in the banking and brokerage firm of Hallett &amp; Company of New York City, and in this connection made frequent trips to Europe, especially to interest European capitalists in the construction of the Kansas Pacific Railway, of which his banking firm was a sponsor. McDowell suffered a severe illness, from which he never made complete recovery, and consequently he returned to his native town of Wayne, and engaged in grape growing on the shores of Lake Keuka. The grape industry was then in its infancy, but he lived to see it attain immense proportions.

At a fruit fair in Hammondsport, New York, that he met William Saunders. The two became friends at once and Saunders was a Sunday guest at McDowell&#x27;s home. There they discussed the new Grange movement and McDowell was greatly interested. The following winter he went to Washington and became associated with the other six founder of the Grange.

Many of McDowell&#x27;s ideas were embodied in the final organization and it was his belief that the organization should have a central division, to protect the work from being broken up and varying with different localities. It was therefore upon his suggestion that the hierarchical ordering of members in a series of seven &quot;Degrees&quot; was built, and he was selected as the first High Priest in the Assembly of Demeter. In 1887, co-founder John R. Thompson, consulting with McDowell, wrote the ritual for the Seventh Degree.

McDowell was treasurer of the National Grange for nearly 21 years, from January 1873 until November 1893, until failing health compelled his resignation in November 1893. McDowell&#x27;s financial experience was invaluable to the Grange, and he never missed attending a National Grange session from the beginning until the time of his death.

He was twice married, his first wife being Miss Josephine Spang of Philadelphia, whom he met and married while in London, and who died a few years later. In December 1874, he married Miss Eva Sherwood of Woodhull, New York, who shortly after joined the Grange, became deeply interested in its work and succeeded her husband as treasurer upon his resignation. They had one daughter.

More than once McDowell&#x27;s eagerness to build into the new order a sound financial system led him to advance his own private funds, and to make many sacrifices for the fulfillment of his financial ideals. McDowell&#x27;s death in March 1894, at Penn Yan, New York, followed shortly the death of co-founder John R. Thompson. Interment was in Lake View Cemetery at Penn Yan.

The other founders of the Grange were Oliver Hudson Kelley, William Saunders, John Trimble, Aaron B. Grosh, John R. Thompson, William M. Ireland and Caroline A. Hall.

<doc id="453828" wikidata="Q499911" url="?curid=453828" title="University of Turin">
<text>The University of Turin (Italian: &quot;Università degli Studi di Torino&quot;, UNITO) is a public research university in the city of Turin, in the Piedmont region of Italy. It is one of the oldest universities in Europe and continues to play an important role in research and training. 

== History ==
=== Overview ===

The University of Turin was founded as a &quot;studium&quot; in 1404, under the initiative of Prince Ludovico di Savoia. From 1427 to 1436 the seat of the university was transferred to Chieri and Savigliano. It was closed in 1536 following the invasion of the Savoy lands by France, and reestablished by Duke Emmanuel Philibert thirty years later. It started to gain its modern shape following the model of the University of Bologna, although significant development did not occur until the reforms made by Victor Amadeus II, who also created the Collegio delle Province for students not natives of Turin.

With the reforms carried out by Victor Amadeus II, the University of Turin became a new reference model for many other universities. During the 19th century, the university faced an enormous growth in faculty and endowment size, becoming a point of reference of the Italian Positivism. Notable scholars of this period include Cesare Lombroso, Carlo Forlanini, and Arturo Graf.

In the 20th century, the University of Turin was one of the centres of the Italian anti-fascism movement. After the post-war period, the increase in the number of students and the improvement of campus structure were imposed, although they lost some of their importance until a new wave of investments was carried out at the end of that century. The new impulse was performed in collaboration with other national and international research centres, as well as with local organizations and the Italian Minister of Public Instruction.

By the end of the 1990s, the local campuses of Alessandria, Novara, and Vercelli became autonomous units under the new University of Eastern Piedmont.

=== Early years (1404–1566) ===

At the beginning of the 15th century, instability in the Lombard region caused by the political and military crisis, coupled with the untimely death of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, induced the teaching staff of the Universities of Pavia and Piacenza to propose to Ludovico di Savoia-Acaia the creation of a new Studium generale.

Choice of the location fell on Turin for a number of reasons: first, it was at the crossroads between the Alps, Liguria and Lombardy; it was also an episcopal seat and in addition, the Savoy Prince was willing to establish a university on his own land, like those in other parts of Italy. In autumn 1404, a bull issued by Benedict XIII, the Avignon Pope, marked the actual birth of a centre of higher learning, formally ratified in 1412 by the Emperor Sigmund&#x27;s certification and subsequently, in 1413, by a bull issued by antipope John XXIII, the Pisan Pope, and probably by another issued in 1419 by Martin V, Pope of Rome, and by a series of papal privileges. The new institution, which initially only held courses in civil and canon law, was authorized to confer both the academic &quot;licentia&quot; and &quot;doctoratus&quot; titles that later became a single &quot;laurea&quot; (degree) title. The Bishop, as Rector of Studies, proclaimed and conferred the title on the new doctors.

The early decades were marked by discontinuity, due to epidemics and crises that plagued the region between the 1420s and the 1430s following the annexation of the Piedmont territories to the Duchy of Savoy and by difficult relations between the university and the local public administration. After a series of interruptions in its activities, the university was moved to Chieri (between 1427 and 1434) and later, in 1434, to Savigliano.

In 1436, when the institution returned to Turin, Ludovico di Savoia, who succeeded Amedeo VIII, introduced a new order of studies whereby the government gained greater control over the university. The ducal licenses of 6 October 1436 set up the three faculties of Theology, Arts and Medicine, and Law, and twenty-five lectureships or chairs. The growth and development of the role of Turin as the subalpine capital led to the consolidation of the university and stability that lasted for almost a hundred years.

From 1443 the university was housed in a modest building purchased and refurbished by the city for this purpose on the corner of via Doragrossa (now Via Garibaldi) and via dello Studio (today&#x27;s via San Francesco d&#x27;Assisi) directly behind the Town Hall, until the opening of the university premises in via Po, in 1720.
The Study, closed at the beginning of 1536 with the French occupation, reopened in 1558 with lecturers at Mondovì; it was re-established in Turin in 1566.
=== Instability and reform by Victor Amadeus II (1566–1739) ===

With Emmanuel Philibert and Charles Emmanuel I, the university enjoyed a season of great prosperity due to the presence of illustrious teachers and a sizeable and culturally motivated student body. However, a lengthy period of decline set in around the second half of the 17th century because of plagues, famines and continual wars: courses were irregular or temporarily suspended, the number of chairs was reduced, and for those temporarily vacant, it was necessary to resort to private instruction.

The opening of the new premises marked a major turning point in the history of the greatest Piedmontese educational institution. The inauguration building in via Po, close to Piazza Castello, and the seats of power and other educational institutions of the city, coincided with the academic year 1720–1721, the first year of the reform of university studies passed by Victor Amadeus II in the context of a radical renewal at all levels of public administration and education.

Victor Amadeus II was convinced that an efficient university controlled directly by the state was the only way to form a faithful and well-trained ruling class that could support him in the process of modernizing the Nation. While the War of Spanish Succession was still being fought, the Duke had entrusted his officials to gather information concerning the structure of the major Italian and foreign universities, and charged the Sicilian jurist Francesco D&#x27;Aguirre with the task of drawing up a reorganization project.

Among the notable innovations of the reform enacted by Victor Amadeus was the opening of the Collegio delle Province (Halls of Residence for the Provinces), which housed one hundred young people of low social extraction to aid them in completing their studies at the State&#x27;s expenses, and the establishment of the chair of Eloquenza Italiana (Italian rhetoric) alongside that of Latin. This had a noteworthy effect on the cultural-linguistic models of the Duchy. At the time, the Piedmontese Studium became a point of reference for university reforms at Parma and Modena and subsequently, a model for the universities in Cagliari and Sassari.

=== French domination (1739–1817) ===

Charles Emmanuel III continued the policy of innovation and consolidation begun by Victor Amadeus II and created a University Museum in 1739. However, in the last decades of the 18th century, the course of events at the university, closely connected to international developments, led to great urban unrest and the loss of state prestige. The revolt of university students in 1791 joined by artisans who stormed the &quot;Collegio delle Province&quot; in 1792 causing numerous victims, was a clear instance of this conflict.

The university and &quot;Collegio&quot; were closed in the autumn of the same year when war broke out against revolutionary France. In January 1799, the provisional Piedmontese government reopened the university under the control of the &quot;Comité d&#x27;instruction publique&quot; (Committee for Public Instruction). In summer 1800, the second provisional government transformed the university into a national university and replaced the faculties with eight special schools, which were based on the existing pattern: chemistry and rural economy, surgery, drawing and fine arts, legislation, medicine, physical and mathematical sciences, literature and veterinary medicine. Two years later, literature was abolished, medicine and surgery were merged and many chairs were suppressed for financial reasons.

Another milestone in the Turin university system was the introduction of the new Imperial order, since Piedmont had become a French Department; this involved the personal appointment by Napoleon of a rector to head each university. Because of its size, number of chairs, teaching staff and students the Piedmontese University became the second largest in the empire after Paris.

A famous student of this age was Joseph-Louis Lagrange.

=== Age of Victor Emmanuel I (1817–1832) ===

With the fall of Napoleon, Victor Emmanuel I brought back the former legislation of the Savoy regime. Innovations in the following years involved the establishment of the chair of political economy in the Faculty of Law in 1817, the opening of a veterinary school at Venaria in 1818, and a new procedure for the appointment of the rector by the academic staff of each faculty, who proposed to the sovereign a list of names of retired or teaching professors.

The uprisings in 1821 were supported by students in Turin to the extent that the Collegio delle Province had to be closed and the university itself operated only to a limited degree. To prevent student assemblies in the capital, it was ordered that all students who did not come from the provinces of Turin, Pinerolo and Susa would continue their education in their place of residence, where coaches went to supervise the progress of their studies and to conduct so-called &quot;private&quot; examinations. In this period too participation in the appointment of the rector was restricted: the president of the magistrature submitted the names of five candidates to the king, chosen among the teaching staff of surgery, medicine, sciences, Law, Literature and Theology but without the involvement of the professors.

=== The Charles Albert years (1832–1864) ===

Charles Albert&#x27;s opening up to moderate liberalism and his international outlook had positive effects on the university, too: like the development of institutions and the foundation of others, in addition to the appointment of illustrious scholars such as the French Augustin Cauchy to teach sublime physics and the Dalmatian Pier Alessandro Paravia to the chair of Italian rhetoric.

In 1832 the Institute of Forensic Medicine was set up, in 1837 a specialization course in obstetrics was introduced and a new theatre and museum of anatomy was opened at the San Giovanni Battista Hospital to bring together the materials stored at the university and those collected since 1818 at the Museum of Pathological Anatomy. In 1842 the Collegio delle Province was reopened and students gradually resumed attending courses, which were better organized thanks to the increased number of chairs. An Upper School of Methods and the chair of the military history of Italy (1846)—which became the chair of modern history—were set up. The chair of political economy was revived.

The new order of 1850 redesigned the Medicine and Surgery course to give scope for clinical experience and practice in hospitals and laid the foundations for the School of Pharmacology, which later became a faculty.

=== Brief decline and revival in academic research (1864–1905) ===

Cultural life involving intellectuals and exiles, journalists and politicians was very lively inside and outside the university until the capital was moved to Florence: its decline commenced when members of the teaching staff were called to government duties or to State management. Thus the circles that gravitated around the Court thinned and the City itself dropped from 220,000 inhabitants to less than 190,000.

However, the university managed to find new life among the science faculties and their staff: in fact, in early 1864, Filippo de Filippi, professor of zoology in the Science Faculty, held the first lecture in Italy on the theories of Charles Darwin. At his death, in 1867, Michele Lessona succeeded to the chair and became director of the Museum of Zoology, then dean of the Faculty of Sciences and, finally, rector from 1877 to 1880.
Thanks to Giulio Bizzozero, who founded the Laboratory of General Pathology (1873) and contributed largely to the spread of the microscope in addition to discovering blood platelets, medicine in Turin branched out into the field of social medicine to meet the health and sanitary needs of the population, in particular with regard to infectious diseases and infant mortality.

The political activities of Luigi Pagliani, professor of hygiene and founder in 1878 of the Hygiene Society, were at the basis of the strategies of public health in Italy, while discoveries made by Edoardo Bellarmino Perroncito, the first to hold a chair of parasitology in Italy (1879), saved the lives of thousands of miners all over Europe.

In 1876, Cesare Lombroso set up the Institute of Forensic Medicine; in 1884 Carlo Forlanini tried out the first artificial lung in Turin.

In 1887 the Botanical Institute and Gardens started a systematic collection of all plants present in the Piedmont Region; in 1878 the University Consortium was constituted with the Municipality, the Province of Turin and some of the neighbouring Provinces &quot;in order to preserve the prestige of the University of Turin as one of the primary centres of university studies [in Italy and Europe].&quot;
At the turn of the century some of the science institutes moved to the Valentino area and vacated the old buildings in via Cavour and via Po. The teaching and research activities of physics, chemistry, pharmacology, physiology, general pathology, human anatomy, pathological anatomy and forensic medicine were relocated to purpose-built facilities. Significant results were reached in the following years both in scientific research and in the organization of teaching.

In 1893 the foundation of the Laboratory of Political Economy connected to the university and the Industrial Museum marked a further feat beyond the scientific sphere.

In the Humanities, Arturo Graf, a &quot;European Turinese&quot;, deserves special mention.

=== 20th century and beyond ===
The 20th century saw the institution of the first Italian chair of psychology, held by Friedrich Kiesow in 1905, the foundation of the Institute of the History of Mediaeval and Modern Art in 1907 and that of Archaeology in 1908. In 1906 the Regia Scuola Superiore di Studi Applicati al Commercio (the Royal School of Applied Studies in Commerce) commenced its courses. In 1935, this early nucleus became the fully-fledged Faculty of Economics, together with the Faculty of Agriculture.

At the turn of the century, a branch of the university formed the first nucleus of the Polytechnic under the guidance of Galileo Ferraris.
In the same period Giuseppe Peano taught at the Faculty of Sciences.

Last century, the Letters Faculty could claim staff such as Umberto Eco, Luigi Pareyson, Nicola Abbagnano, Massimo Mila, Lionello Venturi and Franco Venturi. Luigi Einaudi and Norberto Bobbio taught in the Law Faculty.
The Gentile Reform of 1923 officially recognized 21 universities in Italy; Turin was included among the 10 State universities directly managed and funded by the State but were independent as regards administration and teaching, as far as the law allowed, and supervised by the National Education Ministry.

In the 1930s, Giuseppe Levi trained Salvador Luria, Renato Dulbecco and Rita Levi-Montalcini, each of whom went on to win the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology (after emigrating to the United States).

Many of the protagonists of Italian political and social life in the 20th century, such as Antonio Gramsci and Piero Gobetti, Palmiro Togliatti and Massimo Bontempelli, graduated from Turin University. With its rich variety of subjects, the University of Turin has always maintained a characteristic cultural imprint made up of rigour and independence in teaching, and a spirit of service and openness to European culture.

In recent years, research workers, both in the humanities and in natural sciences, have turned their attention to nations in the southern hemisphere.
Furthermore, some departments are involved in integrated research and co-operation in line with EU universities and with universities in developing countries.
The school of management and economics is the most prestigious in the country.

==Organization==

===Legal status, academic policies, and rankings ===
The current organization of the university system is based on Law 168/89, which set up the Ministero dell&#x27;Università e della Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica (Ministry for the Universities and Scientific and Technological Research) and ordered a number of provisions aimed at granting greater autonomy in university administration, and in the structure of research, teaching and organization.
The objective of the subsequent 1999 University reform was to make the Italian tertiary education system comply with the model defined by the European agreements of the Sorbonne and of Bologna. The teaching reform was implemented at the University of Turin with the development and expansion of the provisions of law. Above all applied to vocational guidance, seen as a strategic link between high school and university education, where professional training must not be given preference over the education of citizens, and of the cultivated individual as valuable per se.
The University of Turin has chosen research as its top priority: both fundamental and business-oriented research that blends skills pertaining to:
* National and international research
* Technological transfer (spin off, patents)
* Relations with local business and with the territory
* Commissioned research
* Various projects (EU structural funds, etc.)

In 2017, the University of Turin was ranked among the best 500 universities in the world by Times Higher Education. It also placed in the 551–600 bracket in QS world university rankings.

===Cooperation and internationalization projects===
At the international level, the University of Turin is oriented both to relations with major organizations and to collaboration with developing countries. In the former field, relations with United Nations Agencies have been stepped up, above all with those already operating in Turin: the ILO International Training Centre through the Turin School of Development, UNICRI and UNSSC.

Courses have been organized or sponsored by the university together with the Turin School of Development for some time now, e.g. the Master of Law (LL.M.) in International Trade Law, the Master of Law (LL.M.) in Intellectual Property (within the Faculty of Law, the Master in Management of Development, the master in Applied Labour Economics for Development, master in Public Procurement Management for Sustainable Development, the master in World Heritage at work, the master in Occupational Safety and Health in the Workplace, as well as the advanced course in Diplomatic and International Studies.

There are also research and teaching agreements with South American nations, using distance learning aids and short intensive exchange programmes for teaching staff and students.

France partnered with the University of Turin to set up the Italo-French University (UIF) between 1998 and 2000. This Agency is dedicated to establishing all possible forms of collaboration between France and Italy in the area of university teaching, scientific research, and culture in general. UIF is involved in the far-reaching project of the construction of a &quot;Europe of Learning.&quot; Reflecting its raised status, UNITO has been ranked as one of the top universities in Italy, as well as a leading research university in Europe.

===Reorganization and undergoing projects===
The University of Turin is engaged not only in redesigning its teaching structure but also in a ten-year construction project to reorganize its premises; work is already underway on refurbishing and rationalizing existing buildings, and on newly acquired property.

Among the projects already completed is the new site at Grugliasco, which houses the Faculties of Veterinary Medicine and Agriculture. Worth mentioning too are the sites of the ex-Italgas works (now Palazzina Luigi Einaudi, already assigned to the Faculties of Law and Political Science for teaching purposes), and the ex-Manifattura Tabacchi; construction of the new Scuola di Biotecnologie; realization at the Centro Pier della Francesca of new laboratories, classrooms and student common rooms for the Computer Science Department, and finally, construction of a new building for teaching purposes at the Ospedale San Luigi, Orbassano.

Since 2001/2002 the Faculties of Political Science and Law have been running a three-year course and a master&#x27;s programme in Co-operation in Development and Peace-keeping.

<text>Tick, Tick, Tick, stylized as ...tick...tick...tick..., is a 1970 American crime drama film directed by Ralph Nelson. It was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Racially provocative for its time, it stars Jim Brown in the role of an African American man elected as the sheriff of a rural county in the American South. It has become something of a cult classic for its cutting-edge portrayal of racial relations and its tense narrative.

==Plot==
In a small Southern town, a black man, Jim Price is elected sheriff over John Little, the white incumbent. Racial tensions exist in the community, and Price gets little assistance from Little, who is leaving office, or from Mayor Parks, who insists he be consulted on any decision the new sheriff makes.

A white man, John Braddock, is arrested on a manslaughter charge after his drunken driving causes the death of a young girl. Braddock&#x27;s father carries considerable influence and demands his son be freed. Price&#x27;s deputy, Bradford Wilkes, is beaten by Little&#x27;s former deputy, Bengy Springer.

Another arrest is made, this time of a black man, George Harley, accused of rape. The townspeople&#x27;s mood turns uglier by the minute, particularly when Braddock&#x27;s father threatens to spring his son by force if necessary.

Little&#x27;s conscience gets the better of him. He agrees to become Price&#x27;s new deputy. Together, they try in vain to persuade other men in town to side with them against Braddock&#x27;s vigilantes and to convince the mayor to call in the National Guard for help. Alone against the mob, Price and Little form a barricade and prepare for the worst when their fellow townsmen suddenly join them in the street.

==Cast==

* Jim Brown as Jim Price
* George Kennedy as John Little
* Fredric March as Mayor Jeff Parks
* Lynn Carlin as Julia Little
* Don Stroud as Benjamin &quot;Bengy&quot; Springer
* Janet MacLachlan as Mary Price 
* Richard Elkins as Bradford Wilkes
* Clifton James as D.J. Rankin
* Bob Random as John Braddock
* Mills Watson as Joe Warren
* Bernie Casey as George Harley
* Anthony James as H.C. Tolbert
* Dub Taylor as Junior
* Ernest Anderson as Homer
* Karl Swenson as Braddock Sr.
* Alex Hakobian as Colusa County Resident

==Production==
===Writing===
Screenwriter and producer James Lee Barrett also created the television adaptation of &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;.

===Casting===
The film&#x27;s lead was played by Jim Brown, who had recently retired as a professional football player. Brown and George Kennedy had previously appeared together in the war film &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;. Another co-star, Bernie Casey, had played in the National Football League from 1961 to 1968, his career intersecting with that of Brown, who was an NFL star from 1957 to 1965.

It was the penultimate film appearance of screen legend Fredric March.

===Filming===
It was made in and around Colusa, California. The town&#x27;s central courthouse square was remodeled to appear like those found in the American South. The same courthouse was also used for exterior shots in the 1962 classic &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.

==Release==
The film was released theatrically in the United States by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in January 1970, the same year as Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Soldier Blue&quot;. It was shown in an anamorphic 2.40:1 aspect ratio. A radio advertisement for the film summarized the story simply: &quot;tick...tick...tick is the sound of time...running out.&quot;

==Home media==
The film was never given an official VHS release in the United States. It was released on DVD in 2012 via the Warner Archive on-demand service.

<text>Supermercados Gigante was a large supermarket chain in Mexico. The chain expanded north of the border as well, as it also had locations in predominantly working-class Mexican-American communities of the United States.

The supermarket chain was owned by parent company Grupo Gigante, which also operates the restaurant chain Toks, and US retail chains such as RadioShack and Office Depot in Mexico.

Supermercados Gigante competed with several other chains, such as Soriana, Comercial Mexicana, Chedraui, Wal-Mart, H-E-B, Falabella, Cencosud and D&amp;S. It was not uncommon to see Wal-Mart receipts around the store touting the fact that said items are cheaper at Supermercados Gigante.

==Supermercados Gigante in pop culture==
The chain appeared on the &quot;Ahí Viene Verónica&quot; film, and on miscellaneous TV Azteca shows.

==Store closures==
On February 28, 2006 Gigante closed some stores in Mexico (1 in Torreon, 7 in Monterrey, 1 in Matamoros, 2 in San Luis Potosí and 1 in Puebla).
==Sale of Gigante==
As of Dec. 6, 2007 Supermercados Gigante was acquired by Organizacion Soriana for US$1.35 billion. The supermarket and hypermarket retail formats of Supermercados Gigante, including its seven US stores, will disappear and the stores will adopt the Soriana formats. The US stores were acquired by Bodega Latina Corp., the US subsidiary of Grupo Comercial Chedraui, and these stores were converted to Bodega Latina&#x27;s &quot;El Super&quot; store banner (Bodega Latina changed its name in 2022 to Chedraui USA). Grupo Gigante will remain in business as a company separate from Soriana, operating the Mexican Radio Shack and Office Depot locations, as well as the Toks restaurant chain.

<text>Reverend Aaron Burt Grosh (May 22, 1803 – March 27, 1884), a Universalist minister, was one of the eight founders, and the first chaplain, of the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, a fraternal organization in the United States. He had a major part in the design of the Grange ritual and was also responsible for the various songs used during various celebrations of the Grange.

Grosh accepted a position in the U.S. Department of Agriculture soon after its establishment, where he served as the first Department Librarian of the United States National Agricultural Library from 1864 until 1869.

He wrote a volume for members of the Grange to give them a better understanding of the organization and its teachings. He also wrote the &quot;Odd Fellows Improved Manual&quot; for the same purpose.

==Legacy==
The other founders of the Grange were Oliver Hudson Kelley, William Saunders, Francis M. McDowell, John Trimble, John R. Thompson, William M. Ireland and Caroline A. Hall.

The United States National Agricultural Library is located in Beltsville, Maryland.

The Aaron B. Grosh Mentoring Award is named for him.

<text>Lisa Jane Opie MBE (born on 15 August 1963) is a retired British squash player, who was one of the game&#x27;s leading woman players in the 1980s and early 1990s. Her biggest successes were winning the British Open in 1991 and four consecutive World Team Championships from 1985 to 1990. Until the rise of Cassie Campion, Lisa was England&#x27;s number 1 player.

Born and raised in Guernsey in the Channel Islands, she was coached in her early years in the game by Reg Harbour. In international competition, she represented England. She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to squash in the 1995 New Year Honours. In later years she was coached by Gavin Dupre from Jersey. They began working together in Guernsey and Lisa later spent time training with him in Germany where he was based as a professional coach.

==Playing career==
Lisa won her first tournament in 1979 and quickly established herself as one of the game&#x27;s best players. She reached the 1981 World Open semi-final but lost to Rhonda Thorne 9–2, 9–0, 9–4. This was to be the first in a series of near-misses for Lisa, as she reached two World Open finals but lost both times to the New Zealand squash legend Susan Devoy – in 1985 (9–4, 9–5, 10–8) and 1987 (9–3, 10–8, 9–2).

The British Open also provided much heartbreak. In 1982 and 1983 she lost in the final against the Australian Vicki Cardwell, and twice against old foe Devoy, in 1984 (5–9, 9–0, 9–7, 9–1) and 1986 (9–4, 9–2, 9–3). However, she eventually won the British Open in 1991 when she beat compatriot Sue Wright in the final 6–9, 9–3, 9–3, 9–4. This made her the first British woman to win the title in 30 years. That same year she finished second in the British Sports Journalists Award, with the athlete Liz McColgan coming first.

<text>Thelma Alice Todd (July 29, 1906 – December 16, 1935) was an American actress and businesswoman who carried the nicknames &quot;The Ice Cream Blonde&quot; and &quot;Hot Toddy.&quot; Appearing in about 120 feature films and shorts between 1926 and 1935, she is remembered for her comedic roles opposite ZaSu Pitts, and in films such as Marx Brothers&#x27; &quot;Monkey Business&quot; and &quot;Horse Feathers&quot; and a number of Charley Chase&#x27;s short comedies. She co-starred with Buster Keaton and Jimmy Durante in &quot;Speak Easily&quot;. She also had roles in several Wheeler and Woolsey and Laurel and Hardy films, the last of which (&quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot;) featured her in a part that was cut short by her sudden death in 1935 at the age of 29.

==Early life==
Todd was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, to John Shaw Todd, an upholsterer from Ireland, and later, a superintendent of streets, an alderman, and Lawrence&#x27;s commissioner of health and charities in 1912 and Alice Elizabeth Edwards, an immigrant from Canada. She had an older brother, William, who died in an accident in 1910. She was a bright and successful student. Intending to become a schoolteacher, she enrolled at the Lowell Normal School (now University of Massachusetts, Lowell) after graduating from high school in 1923. As a student, she earned money as a model, entered beauty pageants in her late teens, gained the attention of Elks Lodge 65, was crowned 1925 Miss Lawrence, and won the title of 1925 Miss Massachusetts. While representing her home state, she was spotted by a Hollywood talent scout. She was offered a slot at the Paramount Players School in Astoria, Queens, New York City, at a time when Paramount Studios was training would-be-actors in acting, diction, athletics and manners. Of the 16 members of her cohort, only Charles &quot;Buddy&quot; Rogers also made it to Hollywood. Todd later found work, in 1929, at Hal Roach Studios.

==Career==
===Film ===

During the silent film era, Todd appeared in numerous supporting roles that made full use of her beauty but gave her little chance to act. With the advent of the talkies, she was able to expand her roles when producer Hal Roach signed her to appear with comedy stars such as Harry Langdon, Charley Chase, and Laurel and Hardy.

In 1931, Roach cast Todd in her own series of 17-to-27-minute slapstick comedy shorts. In an attempt to create a female version of Laurel and Hardy, Roach teamed Todd with ZaSu Pitts for 17 shorts, from &quot;Let&#x27;s do Things&quot; (June 1931) through &quot;One Track Minds&quot; (May 1933). When Pitts left in 1933, she was replaced by Patsy Kelly, who appeared with Todd in 21 shorts, from &quot;Beauty and the Bus&quot; (September 1933) through &quot;An All American Toothache&quot; (January 1936). These shorts often cast Todd as a levelheaded working girl doing her best to remain poised and charming despite numerous problems and her ditzy sidekick&#x27;s embarrassing antics.

In 1931, Todd starred in &quot;Corsair&quot;, a film directed by Roland West, with whom she became romantically involved.

Todd became highly regarded as a capable film comedian, and Roach loaned her to other studios to play opposite Wheeler &amp; Woolsey, Buster Keaton, Joe E. Brown, and the Marx Brothers. She also successfully appeared in dramas, such as the original 1931 version of &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; starring Ricardo Cortez as Sam Spade, where she played Miles Archer&#x27;s treacherous widow. She appeared in around 120 feature films and shorts in her career.

Todd continued her short-subject series through 1935 and was featured in the full-length Laurel and Hardy comedy &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot;. It was her last role before her untimely death at age 29. Although she had completed all of her scenes, producer Roach had them re-shot, fearing negative publicity. He deleted all of Todd&#x27;s dialogue, and limited her appearance to one musical number.

=== Sidewalk Cafe ===
Originally built in 1928, by architect Mark Daniels, as the Castellammare housing tract business block, in August 1934, Todd opened, in partnership with Roland West and his wife, actress Jewel Carmen, Thelma Todd&#x27;s Sidewalk Cafe, at 17575 Pacific Coast Highway, Castellammare, Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles. The ground floor of the building housed the restaurant. On the second floor, Todd and West lived in adjoining ocean-view apartments—with only a sliding wooden door separating their bedrooms— and held parties in the adjacent, private nightclub named Joya (for West&#x27;s ex-wife Jewel Carmen) that took up the rest of the second floor. The third floor, hexagonally shaped, had a dance floor and bandstand. It attracted a diverse clientele of Hollywood celebrities, and many tourists.

== Personal life ==
Todd was briefly married to Pat DiCicco, who supposedly had ties to the mob. The relationship was volatile and DiCicco was abusive to Todd, resulting in her filing for divorce and changing her will to leave him only $1.

==Death==
On the morning of Monday, December 16, 1935, Todd&#x27;s body was discovered inside her chocolate-colored 1934 Lincoln Phaeton convertible. Her Lincoln was parked inside the garage at the home of Jewel Carmen, wife of Roland West. Todd was wearing a mauve and silver gown, mink wrap and expensive jewelry, Carmen&#x27;s house was approximately a block from the topmost side of Todd&#x27;s restaurant. Her death was determined to have been caused by carbon monoxide poisoning. West is quoted in a contemporaneous newspaper account as having locked her out, which may have caused her to seek refuge and warmth in the car. Todd had a wide circle of friends and associates and a busy social life.

Police investigations revealed that she had spent the previous Saturday night (December 14) at the Trocadero, a popular Hollywood restaurant, at a party hosted by entertainer Stanley Lupino and his actress daughter Ida. She had a brief but unpleasant exchange there with her ex-husband, Pat DiCicco. However, her friends stated that she was in good spirits and were aware of nothing in her life that suggested a reason for her to commit suicide. She was driven home from the party in the early hours of December 15 by her chauffeur, Ernest O. Peters.

LAPD detectives concluded that Todd&#x27;s death was accidental, the result of her either warming up the car to drive it or using the heater to keep herself warm. A coroner&#x27;s inquest into the death was held on December 18, 1935. Autopsy surgeon A. P. Wagner testified that there were &quot;no marks of violence anywhere upon or within the body&quot; with only a &quot;superficial contusion on the lower lip.&quot; There are informal accounts of greater signs of injury. The jury ruled that the death appeared accidental, but recommended &quot;further investigation to be made into the case, by proper authorities.&quot;

A grand jury probe was subsequently held to determine whether Todd was murdered. After four weeks of testimony, the inquiry concluded with no evidence of foul play. The case was closed by the Homicide Bureau, which declared the death &quot;accidental with possible suicide tendencies&quot;. However, investigators found no motive for suicide, and Todd left no suicide note.

Todd&#x27;s memorial service, which drew large crowds to view the open casket, was held at Pierce Brothers Mortuary at 720 West Washington Blvd in Los Angeles. The body was cremated. After her mother&#x27;s death in 1969, Todd&#x27;s remains were placed in her mother&#x27;s casket and buried in Bellevue Cemetery in her hometown of Lawrence, Massachusetts.

==Legacy==
For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Todd has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6262 Hollywood Blvd.

<text>James Nathaniel Brown (February 17, 1936 – May 18, 2023) was an American professional football player, civil rights activist, and actor. He played as a fullback for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL) from 1957 to 1965. Considered one of the greatest running backs of all time, as well as one of the greatest players in NFL history, Brown was selected to a Pro Bowl and All-Pro team every season he was in the league, and was recognized as the AP NFL Most Valuable Player three times. Brown won an NFL championship with the Browns in 1964. He led the league in rushing yards in eight out of his nine seasons, and by the time he retired, he held most major rushing records. In 2002, he was named by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; as the greatest professional football player ever.

Brown earned unanimous All-America honors playing college football at Syracuse University, where he was an all-around player for the Syracuse Orangemen football team. The team later retired his number 44 jersey, and he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1995. He is also widely considered one of the greatest lacrosse players of all time, and the Premier Lacrosse League MVP Award is named in his honor. Brown also excelled in basketball and track and field.

In his professional career, Brown carried the ball 2,359 times for 12,312 rushing yards and 106 touchdowns, which were all records when he retired. He averaged 104.3 rushing yards per game and is the only player in NFL history to average over 100 rushing yards per game for his career. Brown was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971. He was named to the NFL&#x27;s 50th, 75th, and 100th Anniversary All-Time Teams, composed of the best players in NFL history. Brown was honored at the 2020 College Football Playoff National Championship as the greatest college football player of all time. His number 32 jersey is retired by the Browns.

Shortly before the end of his football career, Brown became an actor. He retired at the peak of his football career to pursue an acting career. He obtained 53 acting credits and several leading roles throughout the 1970s. He has been described as Hollywood&#x27;s first black action hero and his role in the 1969 film &quot;100 Rifles&quot; made cinematic history for featuring interracial love scenes.

Brown was one of the few athletes, and among the most prominent African Americans, to speak out on racial issues as the civil rights movement was growing in the 1950s. He participated in the Cleveland Summit after Muhammad Ali faced imprisonment for refusing to enter the draft for the Vietnam War, and he founded the Black Economic Union to help promote economic opportunities for minority-owned businesses. Brown later launched a foundation focused on diverting at-risk youth from violence through teaching them life skills, through which he facilitated the Watts truce between rival street gangs in Los Angeles.

==Early life==
Brown was born on St. Simons Island, Georgia, to Swinton Brown, a professional boxer, and his wife, Theresa, a homemaker. He attended Manhasset Secondary School in Manhasset, New York. Brown earned 13 letters playing football, lacrosse, baseball, basketball, and running track.

Brown averaged a Long Island record 38 points per game for his basketball team. That record was later broken by future Boston Red Sox star and Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski of Bridgehampton.

==College career==

Lawyer and Syracuse University lacrosse star Kenneth Molloy, who was involved with the lacrosse program at Manhasset, was a benefactor of Brown and persuaded his alma mater to admit him, which was difficult because according to Molloy, &quot;[Syracuse] did not want black athletes.&quot; Brown was the only African-American player on the football team as a freshman in 1953, and promises of a full scholarship in the second half of the year were not honored; Molloy personally financed and fundraised for Brown&#x27;s first year at the school. He endured racist taunts while he was at Syracuse. He was treated differently from teammates: he was housed in a non-athlete dormitory, warned against dating Caucasian women, and the coaching staff attempted to put him at other positions, including punter, lineman, and wide receiver.

As a sophomore at Syracuse, Brown was the second-leading rusher on the team. As a junior, he rushed for 676 yards (5.2 per carry). In his senior year in 1956, Brown was a consensus first-team All-American. He finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting and set school records for highest season rush average (6.2) and most rushing touchdowns in a single game (6). He ran for 986 yards—third-most in the country despite Syracuse playing only eight games—and scored 14 touchdowns. In the regular-season finale, a 61–7 rout of Colgate, he rushed for 197 yards, scored six touchdowns, and kicked seven extra points for a school-record 43 points. Then in the Cotton Bowl, he rushed for 132 yards, scored three touchdowns, and kicked three extra points, but a blocked extra point after Syracuse&#x27;s third touchdown was the difference as TCU won 28–27.

In addition to his football accomplishments, he excelled in basketball, track, and especially lacrosse. As a sophomore, he was the second-leading scorer for the basketball team (15 ppg), and earned a letter on the track team. In 1955, he finished in fifth place in the National Championship decathlon. His junior year, he averaged 11.3 points in basketball, and was named a second-team All-American in lacrosse. His senior year, he was named a first-team All-American in lacrosse (43 goals in 10 games to rank second in scoring nationally). Brown was so dominant in the game, that lacrosse rules were changed requiring a lacrosse player to keep their stick in constant motion when carrying the ball (instead of holding it close to his body). There is currently no rule in lacrosse that requires a player to keep their stick in motion. He is in the Lacrosse Hall of Fame. The JMA Wireless Dome has an 800 square-foot tapestry depicting Brown in football and lacrosse uniforms with the words &quot;Greatest Player Ever&quot;.

While in college, Brown participated in the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps. After graduating he was commissioned as a second lieutenant. During his time in the NFL, Brown continued his military commitment as a member of the United States Army Reserve. He served for four years and was discharged with the rank of captain.

==Professional career==

Brown was taken in the first round of the 1957 NFL draft by the Cleveland Browns, the sixth overall selection. In the ninth game of his rookie season, against the Los Angeles Rams he rushed for 237 yards, setting an NFL single-game record that stood unsurpassed for 14 years and a rookie record that remained for 40 years until Corey Dillon of the Cincinnati Bengals rushed for 246 yards in a Week 15 game against the Tennessee Oilers.

Brown broke the single-season rushing record in 1958, gaining 1,527 yards in the 12-game season, shattering the previous NFL mark of 1,146 yards set by Steve Van Buren in 1949, as well as most rushing yards per game in a season, with 127.3. In this MVP season, Brown led all players with a staggering 17 touchdowns scored, beating his nearest rival, Baltimore Colts wide receiver Raymond Berry, by 8.

After nine years in the NFL, he departed as the league&#x27;s record holder for both single-season (1,863 in 1963) and career rushing (12,312 yards), as well as the all-time leader in rushing touchdowns (106), total touchdowns (126), and all-purpose yards (15,549). He was the first player to reach the 100-rushing-touchdowns milestone, and only a few others have done so since, despite the league&#x27;s expansion to a 16-game season in 1978 and 17-game season in 2021 (Brown&#x27;s first four seasons were only 12 games, and his last five were 14 games).

Brown&#x27;s record of scoring 100 touchdowns in only 93 games stood until LaDainian Tomlinson did it in 89 games during the season. Brown holds the record for total seasons leading the NFL in all-purpose yards (five: 1958–1961, 1964), and is the only rusher in NFL history to average over 100 yards per game for a career. In addition to his rushing, Brown was a superb receiver out of the backfield, catching 262 passes for 2,499 yards and 20 touchdowns, while also adding another 628 yards returning kickoffs. In every season he played, Brown was voted into the Pro Bowl, and he left the league in style by scoring three touchdowns in his final Pro Bowl game.


Brown was cognizant of the physical toll exacted by carrying the ball as a lead running back and began foreshadowing an early retirement as early as 1960, when the 24-year old Brown told a journalist, &quot;I&#x27;ve carried the ball 749 times in three years with the Browns. I get the same question everywhere I go — will so much ball-carrying and the tackling that results shorten my career? Will I end up my career groggy or, even worse, punchy as a punch-drunk prizefighter? ... I hope I&#x27;m smart enough to quit the game before somebody has to tell me I&#x27;m finished. I want to leave feeling I can still do the job. That&#x27;s the way the great quarterback Otto Graham finished with the Browns. He most likely had several good seasons left... But Otto quit while he was on top. I hope I have the good sense to follow the example.&quot;

Brown&#x27;s 1,863 rushing yards in the 1963 season remains a Cleveland franchise record. It is currently the oldest franchise record for rushing yards out of all 32 NFL teams. His average of 133 yards per game that season is exceeded only by O. J. Simpson&#x27;s 1973 season. Brown led the league in rushing a record eight times. He was also the first NFL player to rush for over 10,000 yards. He was very difficult to tackle (shown by his all-time record of 5.2 yards per carry), often requiring more than one defender to bring him down. Brown was famous for his stiff arm and combined speed, power and relentless endurance as a rusher.

After winning his third league MVP award in 1965, Brown retired in July 1966 at age 30 while still in top form. He was in England for the shooting of the movie &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;. He had expected to return to the Browns afterwards, but retired when team owner Art Modell threatened him with fines for missing training camp. Brown held the NFL career rushing record of 12,312 yards until it was broken by Walter Payton on October 7, 1984, during Payton&#x27;s 10th NFL season. Brown is still the Browns&#x27; all-time leading rusher. As of 2018, he ranked 11th on the all-time rushing list. Brown&#x27;s NFL touchdown record would stand until 1994 when Jerry Rice surpassed him with his 127th touchdown.

During Brown&#x27;s career, Cleveland won the NFL championship in 1964 and were runners-up in 1957 and 1965, his rookie and final season, respectively. In the 1964 championship game, Brown rushed 27 times for 114 yards and caught 3 passes for 37.

==Acting career==
Brown appeared in many movies and was at times described as a black Superman or a black John Wayne. While not considered a gifted actor, he helped to expand the range of roles available to black actors.

===Early films===
Brown began his acting career before the 1964 season, playing a buffalo soldier in a Western action film called &quot;Rio Conchos&quot;. The film premiered at Cleveland&#x27;s Hippodrome theater on October 23, with Brown and many of his teammates in attendance. The reaction was lukewarm. Brown, one reviewer said, was a serviceable actor, but the movie&#x27;s overcooked plotting and implausibility amounted to &quot;a vigorous melodrama for the unsqueamish.&quot;

In early 1966, Brown was shooting his second film in London. MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; cast Brown as Robert Jefferson, one of 12 convicts sent to France during World War II to assassinate German officers meeting at a castle near Rennes in Brittany before the D-Day invasion. Production delays due to bad weather meant he missed at least the first part of training camp on the campus of Hiram College, which annoyed Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell, who threatened to fine Brown $1,500 () for every week of camp he missed. Brown, who had previously said that 1966 would be his last season, the final year of a three-year contract, announced his retirement, instead.

===Leading man===

MGM cast Brown in his first lead role in &quot;The Split&quot; (1968), based on a Parker novel by Donald E. Westlake. He was paid $125,000 for the role. Brown followed it with &quot;Riot&quot; (1969), a prison film for MGM. Both it and &quot;The Split&quot; were solid hits at the box office. Biographer Mike Freeman credits Brown with becoming &quot;the first black action star&quot;, due to roles such as the Marine captain he portrayed in the hit 1968 film &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;.

Brown went to 20th Century Fox for &quot;100 Rifles&quot; (1969). Brown was billed over co stars Raquel Welch and Burt Reynolds and had a love scene with Welch, one of the first interracial love scenes and the first in a major Hollywood movie. Raquel Welch reflected on the scene in Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Jim Brown: All-American&quot;. For this role, Brown was paid $200,000 and received five percent of the film&#x27;s box office, becoming one of the highest paid black actors.

===Co-starring===
Brown starred with fellow NFL star Fred Williamson and Jim Kelly in &quot;Three the Hard Way&quot; which was released in 1974. He would later star with Williamson, Kelly again with Lee Van Cleef in &quot;Take a Hard Ride&quot;, a western which was released the following year. The Williamson, Brown and Kelly trio would again appear together with Richard Roundtree in &quot;One Down, Two to Go&quot;, a 1982 actioner.

===Later acting career===
His 1980s appearances were mostly on television. Brown appeared in some TV shows including &quot;Knight Rider&quot; in the season-three premiere episode &quot;Knight of the Drones&quot;. Brown appeared alongside fellow former football player Joe Namath on &quot;The A-Team&quot; episode &quot;Quarterback Sneak&quot;. Brown also appeared on &quot;CHiPs&quot;, episodes one and two, in season three, as a pickpocket on roller skates.

He appeared opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Running Man&quot;, an adaptation of a Stephen King novel, as Fireball, and had a cameo in the spoof &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Git You Sucka&quot; (1988).

Brown appeared in &quot;Original Gangstas&quot; (1996) and &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; (1996) and &quot;Sucker Free City&quot; (2004) and played a defensive coach, Montezuma Monroe, in &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; (1999).

== Civil rights work ==
Brown was one of the few athletes to speak out on racial issues in the 1950s as the civil rights movement was growing. He was one of the most prominent African American athletes to engage in civil rights activism, and he called on other African American athletes to become involved in similar initiatives off the field. In 1967, Brown, alongside Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Carl Stokes, were all members of the Cleveland Summit, a meeting with Muhammad Ali held with the intention of convincing the four to rally behind and recruit others to help Ali&#x27;s cause of civil rights in the United States. Because Ali was a &quot;pariah&quot; in American society at the time because of his opposition to the Vietnam War and refusal to enter the draft, his boxing license had been revoked, and he faced up to five years in prison. For Brown and the other participants to stand with Ali in support of him and his position consequently put &quot;their reputations and their careers&quot; at risk. The Cleveland Summit was later called &quot;a significant turning point for the role of the athlete in society&quot; and &quot;one of the most important civil rights acts in sports history&quot;, as well as a predecessor of the 21st century protest movement initiated by Colin Kaepernick.

In 1966, Brown founded the Negro Industrial Economic Union, later known as the Black Economic Union (BEU), to help promote economic opportunities for minority owned businesses. Brown later stated in a 1968 &quot;Ebony&quot; interview, &quot;We&#x27;ve got to stop wasting all our energy and money marching and picketing and going things like camping-down in Washington on a Poor People&#x27;s Campaign...We&#x27;ve got to get off the emotional stuff and do something that will bring about real change. We&#x27;ve got to have industries and commercial enterprises and build our own sustaining economic base. Then we can face white folks man-to-man and we can deal.&quot; The BEU secured loans and grants, including from the Ford Foundation, to support community initiatives related to food, medicines and farm and economic ventures in specific counties, starting with Marshall County, Mississippi. Because of Brown&#x27;s economic advocacy for the African American community, Richard Nixon expressed support for black capitalism in his campaign in the 1968 United States presidential election and received an endorsement from Brown. In 1988, Brown founded the Amer-I-Can Foundation, an organization that sought to divert gang members and prisoners from violence by teaching them life skills. Through the foundation, Brown helped establish the Watts truce between rival street gangs in Los Angeles.

Perceiving Brown and other outspoken African-American athletes as a threat, the Federal Bureau of Investigation monitored Brown and his organizations. Files declassified in 2003 showed that the FBI, the United States Secret Service, and several police departments had monitored Brown and the Black Economic Union, attempting to smear the group as a source of Communist and radical Muslim extremism and collecting information to damage Brown&#x27;s reputation.

==Other post-football activities==
Brown posed in the nude for the September 1974 issue of &quot;Playgirl&quot; magazine, and was one of the rare celebrities to allow full-frontal nude pictures to be used.
Brown also worked as a color analyst on NFL telecasts for CBS in 1978, teaming with Vin Scully and George Allen.

In 1983, 17 years after retiring from professional football, Brown mused about coming out of retirement to play for the Los Angeles Raiders when it appeared that Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris would break Brown&#x27;s all-time rushing record. Brown disliked Harris&#x27; style of running, criticizing the Steelers&#x27; running back&#x27;s tendency to run out of bounds, a marked contrast to Brown&#x27;s approach of fighting for every yard and taking on the approaching tackler. Eventually, Walter Payton of the Chicago Bears broke the record on October 7, 1984, with Brown having ended thoughts of a comeback. Harris, who retired after the 1984 season after playing eight games with the Seattle Seahawks, fell short of Brown&#x27;s mark. Following Harris&#x27;s last season, in that January, a challenge between Brown and Harris in a 40-yard dash was nationally televised. Brown, at 48 years old, was certain he could beat Harris, though Harris was only 34 years old and just ending his elite career. Harris clocked in at 5.16 seconds, and Brown in at 5.72 seconds, pulling up in towards the end of the race clutching his hamstring.

In 1965, Brown was the first black televised boxing announcer when he announced a televised boxing match in the United States, for the Terrell–Chuvalo fight, and is also credited with then first suggesting a career in boxing promotion to Bob Arum.

Brown&#x27;s autobiography, published in 1989 by Zebra Books, was titled &quot;Out of Bounds&quot; and was co-written with Steve Delsohn. He was a subject of the book &quot;Jim: The Author&#x27;s Self-Centered Memoir of the Great Jim Brown&quot;, by James Toback.

In 1993, Brown was hired as a color commentator for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, a role he occupied for the first six pay-per-view events. In 2008, Brown initiated a lawsuit against Sony and EA Sports for using his likeness in the Madden NFL video game series. He claimed that he &quot;never signed away any rights that would allow his likeness to be used&quot;. From 2008 until his death, Brown served as an executive advisor to the Browns. In that capacity he helped to build relationships with the team&#x27;s players and to further enhance the NFL&#x27;s wide range of sponsored programs through the team&#x27;s player programs department. On May 29, 2013, Brown was named a special advisor to the Browns. Brown became a part-owner of the New York Lizards of Major League Lacrosse, joining a group of investors in the purchase of the team in 2012.

On October 11, 2018, Brown along with Kanye West met with President Donald Trump to discuss the state of America, among other topics. Criticized by the black community for the meeting, Brown said that Trump was the sitting president and &quot;we can&#x27;t ignore that seat and just call names of the person that&#x27;s sitting in it&quot;. Brown called him &quot;accessible&quot;, and said that the president was not a racist.

==Assault allegations==
Brown was arrested at least seven times for assault, mainly against women. During the era when the incidents occurred, prominent men were usually not scrutinized for reported offenses against women. He was never found guilty of a major crime; in most of the cases, the women refused to press charges after calling the police. In 1965, Brown was arrested in his hotel room for assault and battery against 18-year-old Brenda Ayres; he was later acquitted of those charges. A year later, he fought paternity allegations that he fathered her child.

In 1968, Brown was charged with assault with intent to commit murder after model Eva Bohn-Chin was found beneath the balcony of Brown&#x27;s second-floor apartment. The charges were later dismissed after Bohn-Chin refused to cooperate with the prosecutor&#x27;s office. Brown was also ordered to pay a $300 fine for striking a deputy sheriff involved in the investigation during the incident. In Brown&#x27;s autobiography, he stated that Bohn-Chin was angry and jealous over an affair he had been having with Gloria Steinem, and this argument is what led to the &quot;misunderstanding with the police&quot;.

In 1970, Brown was found not guilty of assault and battery, the charges stemming from a road-rage incident that had occurred in 1969. In 1975, Brown was convicted of misdemeanor battery for beating and choking his golfing partner, Frank Snow. He was sentenced to one day in jail, two years&#x27; probation, and a fine of $500. In 1985, Brown was charged with raping a 33-year-old woman. The charges were later dismissed. In 1986, he was arrested for assaulting his fiancée Debra Clark. Clark refused to press charges, and he was released.

According to several victims and witnesses, who were interviewed for the 2022 documentary series &quot;Secrets of Playboy&quot;, Brown brutally raped and assaulted numerous women at the Playboy Mansion. These alleged incidents occurred from the late 1970s into the 1990s. According to the documentary, as well as other sources and numerous interviews, other perpetrators of rape and assault at the Playboy Mansion included Roman Polanski and Bill Cosby.

In 1999, Brown was arrested and charged with making terroristic threats toward his wife Monique. According to Brown, &quot;The only time [we] ever have an argument is during [her menstrual period]&quot;. Later that year, he was found guilty of vandalism for smashing her car with a shovel. He was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation, one year of domestic violence counseling, and 400 hours of community service or 40 hours on a work crew along with a $1,800 fine. Brown ignored the terms of his sentence and in 2000 was sentenced to six months in jail, which he began serving in 2002 after refusing the court-ordered counseling and community service. He was released after three months.

&quot;There is no excuse for violence,&quot; said Brown in 2015. &quot;There is never a justification for anyone to impose themselves on someone else. And it will always be incorrect when it comes to a man and a woman, regardless of what might have happened. You need to be man enough to take the blow. That is always the best way. Do not put your hands on a woman.&quot;

==Personal life==

Brown married his first wife Sue Brown (née Jones) in September 1959. She sued for divorce in 1968, charging him with &quot;gross neglect&quot;. Together, they had three children, twins born 1960, and a son born 1962. Their divorce was finalized in 1972. Brown was ordered to pay $2,500 per month in alimony and $100 per week for child support.

In December 1973, Brown proposed to 18-year-old Diane Stanley, a Clark College student he met in Acapulco, Mexico, in April of that year. They broke off their engagement in 1974.

Brown married his second wife, Monique, in 1997; they had two children.

===Death===
Brown died of natural causes at the age of 87 on May 18, 2023, at his home in Los Angeles. He died with his wife by his side.

Tributes from the sports world and beyond soon poured in, with former NFL running back Barry Sanders posting on Twitter that &quot;You can&#x27;t underestimate the impact Jim Brown had on the NFL.&quot; Emmitt Smith, the NFL&#x27;s all-time leader in rushing yards, wrote &quot;He is and was a true legend in sports and in the community using his platform to help others.&quot; NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said &quot;Jim Brown was a gifted athlete — one of the most dominant players to ever step on any athletic field — but also a cultural figure who helped promote change.&quot; LeBron James, an NBA star, wrote in tribute that &quot;We lost a hero today. Rest in Paradise to the legend Jim Brown. I hope every black athlete takes the time to educate themselves about this incredible man and what he did to change all of our lives. We all stand on your shoulders Jim Brown.&quot; Barack Obama, the 44th president and the first black president of the United States, wrote, &quot;I was too young to remember Jim Brown&#x27;s playing days, but I knew his legacy. One of the greatest football players ever, he was also an actor and activist – speaking out on civil rights, and pushing other black athletes to do the same.&quot;

== In other media ==
Darrin Dewitt Henson played Brown in the 2008 sports drama The Express: The Ernie Davis Story. Brown was portrayed by David Ajala in the London cast of the 2013 play &quot;One Night in Miami&quot; and by Aldis Hodge in the subsequent 2021 film adaptation of the same name. According to Hodge, he heard &quot;through the grapevine&quot; that Brown - the only subject of the film alive at the film&#x27;s release - liked the film and approved of Hodge&#x27;s portrayal of him.

==Sporting accolades==
Brown&#x27;s memorable professional career led to his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971. His football accomplishments at Syracuse garnered him a berth in the College Football Hall of Fame in 1995. Brown was inducted in the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1983.
Brown and Earl Campbell are the only players to win the NFL Rookie of the Year and MVP awards in the same year. Brown is the only NFL player to average 100 rushing yards per game for their career. In 118 career games, he averaged 104.3 yards per game and 5.2 yards per carry; only Barry Sanders (99.8 yards per game and 5.0 yards per carry) comes close to these totals. For example, Hall of Famer Walter Payton averaged 88 yards per game during his career with a 4.4 yards-per-carry average. Emmitt Smith averaged 81.2 yards per game with a 4.2 yards-per-carry average. Brown held the yards-per-carry record by a running back (minimum 750 carries) from his retirement in 1965 until Jamaal Charles broke the record in 2012.

ESPN&#x27;s SportsCentury in 1999 ranked Brown fourth among their &quot;50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century&quot;, trailing only Muhammed Ali, Babe Ruth, and Michael Jordan. In 2002, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; selected him as the greatest football player of all time, as did the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; in 2014. On November 4, 2010, Brown was chosen by NFL Network&#x27;s NFL Films production &quot;The Top 100: NFL&#x27;s Greatest Players&quot; as the second-greatest player in NFL history, behind only Jerry Rice. In November 2019, he was selected as one of the twelve running backs on the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.

On January 13, 2020, Brown was named the greatest college football player of all time by ESPN, during a ceremony at the College Football Playoff National Championship Game celebrating the 150th anniversary of college football.

<text>John Richardson Thompson (July 28, 1834 – February 12, 1894) was one of the eight founders of the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, a fraternal organization in the United States.

==Biography==
Thompson was born on July 28, 1834, in Littleton, New Hampshire and grew up on the family farm. He served in the American Civil War with the 15th Vermont Volunteers, rising to the rank of colonel. Following the war, he took a job at the United States Department of the Treasury, where he remained for many years.

Thompson is believed to be the first to whom Oliver Hudson Kelley talked about his dream of setting up a fraternal organization of farmers. Thompson&#x27;s Freemasonry training became a valuable tool in developing the ritualistic work of The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, revolving the ritualistic teachings around the farm and farm family. He died on February 12, 1894.

==Legacy==
The other founders of the Grange were:Oliver Hudson Kelley, William Saunders, Francis M. McDowell, John Trimble, Aaron B. Grosh, William M. Ireland and Caroline A. Hall.

<text>Puente Nacional is a municipality in the Mexican state of Veracruz. Puente Nacional is bordered by Actopan, the port of Veracruz, and La Antigua. It stands on the railway and on Federal Highways 140 and 125. 

==History==
Nearby the town of Puente Nacional, to its south, is the old National Bridge (Puente Nacional) it is named for. Originally named the Puente del Rey, it was constructed over the Antigua River by the Spanish in 1806 on the camino del Rey (highway of the king), later the National Road, between Vera Cruz and Mexico City. 

During the Mexican–American War the bridge was a key point on the National Road, the American line of communications of their army advancing on Mexico City and a site of several engagements in June, July and August 1847, between Mexican guerrillas and U.S. troops guarding trains of supply wagons that crossed this bridge on their to and from the interior of Mexico in 1847–1848. The location was a bottleneck on the route with topography that lent itself to an ambush by guerrilla forces. Following the capture of Mexico City, General Winfield Scott established posts along the National Road to protect the route from guerrillas, one with 750 men, was located at the Puente Nacional. 

==Economy==
In Puente Nacional the major products are coffee, fruits, and sugar.

<doc id="453888" wikidata="Q1643121" url="?curid=453888" title="Six Apart">
<text>Six Apart Ltd., sometimes abbreviated 6A, is a software company known for creating the Movable Type blogware, TypePad blog hosting service, and Vox (the blogging platform). The company also is the former owner of LiveJournal. Six Apart is headquartered in Tokyo. The name is a reference to the six-day age difference between its formerly married co-founders, Ben and Mena Trott.

==History==
The company was founded in September 2001 after Ben, during a period of unemployment, wrote what became Movable Type to allow Mena to easily produce her weblog. When version 1.0 was put on the web, it was downloaded over 100 times in the first hour.

===2003–2006===
In 2003, Six Apart received initial venture capital funding from a group led by Joi Ito and his Neoteny Co., which allowed the company to hire additional employees, acquire a French weblog publishing company, and unveil plans for what was to become its hosted weblog publishing system, TypePad. In 2004, Six Apart completed a second round of funding with August Capital, which allowed it to make acquisitions of other companies. In January 2005, Six Apart purchased Danga Interactive, parent company of LiveJournal, from owner Brad Fitzpatrick, who was named Six Apart&#x27;s chief architect. In March 2006, Six Apart announced the acquisition of the SplashBlog camera phone blogging service. June 2006 saw the release of their new Web 2.0 blogging platform, Vox.

Its CEO was Chris Alden. Prominent weblogger Anil Dash joined the company in 2003, as did former head of Wired Digital Andrew Anker. Six Apart&#x27;s board of directors consisted of Barak Berkowitz, Mena Trott, David Marquardt, David Hornik, Reid Hoffman, and Jun Makihara.

On September 6, 2006, Six Apart bought Rojo.com. President Chris Alden became executive vice president of Six Apart and general manager of Movable Type. CTO Aaron Emigh became executive vice president and general manager of core technologies.
===2007===
On September 15, 2007, chairman and chief executive Barak Berkowitz stepped aside and was replaced by Chris Alden, who had run the company&#x27;s professional software unit.

On December 2, 2007, Six Apart announced it was selling LiveJournal to SUP Fabrik, a Russian media company that had licensed the LiveJournal brand and software for use in Russia.

===2008===
On April 21, 2008, Six Apart said it acquired Apperceptive, a New York social media agency, as part of its new strategy. It declined to disclose financial terms of the deal. It also partnered with advertising agency Adify. Just as in an advertising network, bloggers were able to sign up and participate in advertising campaigns managed by Six Apart.

On December 1, 2008, Six Apart announced the acquisition of micro blogging website Pownce. The Pownce website was shut down on December 15. The key developers of Pownce (Leah Culver and Mike Malone) stayed on at Six Apart through early 2010, with Pownce technology being integrated into TypePad and TypePad Conversations.

===2010===
On September 2, 2010 Six Apart announced that they would be shutting down their blogging/social networking site Vox with a final termination date set for September 30, 2010.

Beginning from September 15, 2010 Vox users would not be able to post new blog posts.

On September 22, Six Apart announced its intention to join forces with VideoEgg to create a modern media company called SAY Media.

===2011===

On January 21, 2011, SAY Media announced that it was selling the Six Apart brand and the worldwide Movable Type business to Infocom, a Japanese information technology company. As a result of this transaction, the headquarters of Six Apart is now Tokyo, Japan.

Nobuhiro Seki, who was general manager of Six Apart, K.K. prior to this announcement, became president and CEO of Six Apart.

<doc id="453892" wikidata="Q1872572" url="?curid=453892" title="Lowell Bergman">
<text>Lowell Bergman (born July 24, 1945) is an American journalist, television producer, and professor of journalism. During a career spanning nearly five decades, Bergman worked as a producer, reporter, and director of investigative reporting at ABC News and as a producer for CBS’s &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, where he left in 1998 as the senior producer of investigations for CBS News. He founded the investigative reporting program at the Graduate School of Journalism at UC Berkeley and taught there as a professor for 28 years. He was also a producer and correspondent for the PBS documentary series &quot;Frontline&quot;. Bergman retired in 2019.

Bergman&#x27;s investigation into the tobacco industry was depicted in Michael Mann’s &quot;The Insider&quot;, which was nominated for seven Academy Awards and featured Al Pacino as Bergman. From 1999 to 2008, Bergman was an investigative correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 1999, he formed a partnership between the &quot;Times&quot; and PBS’s &quot;Frontline&quot;, leading to collaborative investigative projects across broadcast, print, and web platforms. Bergman&#x27;s work has been recognized with honors in both print and broadcasting, including the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, awarded to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2004 for “A Dangerous Business,” an investigation into worker safety violations and environmental law violations in the cast-iron sewer and water pipe industry.

Bergman has received numerous Emmys, six Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Silver and Golden awards Silver and Golden Baton awards, three Peabodys, two Harvard Goldsmith Awards for Investigative Reporting, a George Polk Award, the RFK Grand Prize, a Sidney Hillman Award for Labor Reporting, a Bart Richards Award for Media Criticism, the National Press Club’s Arthur Rowse Award for Press Criticism, a Mirror Award from the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, and the James Madison Freedom of Information Award for Career Achievement from the Society of Professional Journalists.

Through the non-profit production company Investigative Studios, he has continued to work on documentaries and documentary series, serving as co-executive producer with Brian Knappenberger on Netflix’s &quot;The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez&quot; and as executive producer and reporter on &quot;Agents of Chaos&quot;, a co-production with Alex Gibney’s Jigsaw Productions.

== Early life and career ==
Bergman’s grandmother was the first secretary-treasurer of an ILGWU local in New York; his grandfather was also a founder. His father, Alex Bergman, emigrated to the United States from the Hungary via the Cuba in 1938. His mother was born in the United States, had a career in the fashion industry, taught gourmet cooking, and then managed apartment units in Mt. Vernon, New York until her death in 2019 at the age of 101.

Bergman graduated with honors in sociology and history from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and was a graduate fellow in philosophy at the University of California, San Diego, where he studied under Herbert Marcuse. In 1969, he co-founded the &quot;San Diego Free Press&quot; (later &quot;San Diego Street Journal&quot;), an alternative newspaper, with several fellow students. Bergman and others, including Richard “Black Dick” Blackburn, instigated the probe that led to the downfall of the San Diego financial empire of C. Arnholt Smith, president and chief executive officer of U.S. National Bank in San Diego. Bergman went on to contribute to &quot;Ramparts&quot; and &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;. He also made contributions to Ramparts, &quot;The San&quot; Francisco Examiner, Rolling Stone, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. His work for the &quot;Times&quot; included guiding its first documentary partnerships with PBS’s &quot;Frontline&quot;, covering the energy crisis in California and Al Qaeda before and after 9/11.

In 1977, Bergman helped found the Center for Investigative Reporting. He was part of the reporting team that continued the work of &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; reporter Don Bolles, who was assassinated in 1976 while investigating land fraud committed by organized crime.

== Television career ==
From 1978 until 1983, Bergman was a producer and reporter and was then in charge of investigative reporting at ABC News. He was one of the original producers of &quot;20/20&quot;. In 1983, Bergman joined CBS News as a producer for the weekly newsmagazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and worked with its lead correspondent, Mike Wallace. Over 14 years, he produced more than 50 stories, including exposes of organized crime, international arms dealing featuring Sarkis Soghanalian, then the world’s main weapons supplier to Saddam Hussein, international drug trafficking in Venezuela involving the CIA, and the Iran-Iraq and Persian Gulf wars. His five stories on California’s then-expanding prison system, including the supermax facility at Pelican Bay, revealed the conditions of solitary confinement and the staging of “gladiator” matches by correctional officers. He also produced the first U.S. television interviews with Lebanon’s Hezbollah leadership in the early 1990s.

The story of Bergman&#x27;s investigation of the tobacco industry for &quot;60 Minutes&quot; was chronicled in the 1999 feature film &quot;The Insider&quot;, in which Bergman was played by Al Pacino. According to Bergman, the film&#x27;s success and its portrayal of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; correspondent Mike Wallace and producer Don Hewitt led to him being virtually blacklisted from the show.

== Reporting across multiple platforms ==
Bergman established an alliance between &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Frontline&quot; after leaving network news in the late 1990s. This collaboration resulted in a series of stories, including coverage of California’s energy crisis, the country’s war on drugs, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, the roots of 9/11, the credit card and gold industries, the post-9/11 hunt for “sleeper cells” in America, and recent Al Qaeda’s attacks in Europe. The collaboration also produced a number of award-winning projects with print, broadcast, and online components. Extensive websites, prepared in large part by students in Bergman’s seminar, accompanied many of these projects, including “Secret History of the Credit Card”, “Al Qaeda&#x27;s New Front”, “The Enemy Within”, “The Real CSI” and “News War”. “News War” examined the challenges facing the mainstream news media, drawing on more than 80 interviews with key figures and behind-the-scenes access to news organizations.

Collaborating with other &quot;New York Times&quot; reporters, Bergman helped produce a series of articles detailing the financial arrangements between Vice President Dick Cheney and Halliburton, both before and after Cheney&#x27;s retirement as chief executive officer of that firm.

== Awards and honors ==
Bergman has received top honors in both print and broadcasting. &quot;The New York Times&quot; won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, for “the work of David Barstow and Lowell Bergman that relentlessly examined death and injury among American workers and exposed employers who break basic safety rules.” The series, &quot;A Dangerous Business&quot;, detailed a record of worker safety violations and environmental law violations in the iron sewer and water pipe industry.

He is the recipient of numerous Emmys and other honors, including six Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Silver and Golden awards, three Peabodys, a Writers Guild Award, the National Press Club&#x27;s Consumer Journalism Award for Television on the credit card industry, a George Polk Award, a Sidney Hillman award for labor reporting, and the James Madison Freedom of Information Award for Career Achievement from the Society of Professional Journalists.

== Academic highlights ==

Bergman has mentored many journalists and facilitated the publication of student projects in major media outlets. Projects from his investigative reporting seminars at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, have appeared on national television, including PBS&#x27; &quot;Frontline&quot; and &quot;Frontline/World&quot;, ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot;, &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, and &quot;60 Minutes II&quot;; and in print, where students have been primary authors or contributors of stories in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, as well as in magazines, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, and international and local newspapers. Bergman also helps secure financial support from private donors and foundations for student travel and research.

In addition to being the first President of the Center for Investing Reporting in 1997, he was a consultant involved in creating Pro Publica thirty years later and the founder of the Investigative Reporting Program (IRP) at UC Berkeley in 2006. He served as Executive Director and Chairman of the Board of the UC Berkeley-affiliated Investigative Studios, a non-profit production company, until late 2019.

In May 2007, Bergman established three annual Fellowships in Investigative Reporting at UC Berkeley.

<text>The University of Chicago Law School is the law school of the University of Chicago, a private research university in Chicago, Illinois. It employs more than 180 full-time and part-time faculty and hosts more than 600 students in its Juris Doctor program, while also offering the Master of Laws, Master of Studies in Law and Doctor of Juridical Science degrees in law. 

The law school was originally housed in Stuart Hall, a Gothic-style limestone building on the campus&#x27;s main quadrangles. Since 1959, it has been housed in an Eero Saarinen-designed building across the Midway Plaisance from the main campus of the University of Chicago. The building was expanded in 1987 and again in 1998. It was renovated in 2008, preserving most of Saarinen&#x27;s original structure.

Members of the faculty have included Cass Sunstein, Richard Posner, and Richard Epstein, three of the most-cited legal scholars of the 20th and early 21st centuries. Other notable former faculty members include U.S. President Barack Obama and U.S. Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia, John Paul Stevens, and Elena Kagan.

==History==
===Establishment of a new law school in Chicago===

When the University of Chicago was founded in 1892, its president William Rainey Harper expressed a desire to establish a law school for the university that would improve democratic government. At the time, Harper observed that, &quot;[t]hus far democracy seems to have found no way of making sure that the strongest men should be placed in control of the country&#x27;s business.&quot; Harper took advice from a number of his contemporaries. One such adviser, a professor at the University of Cambridge, suggested that the object of the new law school should be to train students to become &quot;leaders of the bar and ornaments of the bench, inspiring teachers, scientific writers and wise reformers&quot; and emphasising public law and comparative law. Another adviser, a member of the Chicago bar, suggested that Harvard Law School, led by Christopher Columbus Langdell and influenced by the casebook method at the time, had &quot;lost touch with great leaders among jurists and lawyers&quot; and that the new law school in Chicago should focus on &quot;social economics&quot; or &quot;principles of statesmanship&quot; for lawyers. Noted legal scholar Ernst Freund suggested that the law school promote an interdisciplinary approach to legal education, offering elective courses in subjects such as history and political science. Ultimately, Harper settled with the view that the study of law should not occur in a vacuum, and that it should take into account &quot;the whole field of man as a social being&quot;.

In 1901, Harper announced that the new law school would be established the following year. He requested assistance from the faculty of Harvard Law School, whose dean at the time, James Barr Ames, granted professor Joseph Henry Beale a two-year leave of absence to serve as the first dean of the law school in Chicago. He did so on the condition that Chicago &quot;have ideals and methods similar to [those of] the Harvard Law School&quot;. However, Ames objected to the proposed curriculum, which contemplated close affiliation with social science departments in the university and subjects that were not found in a traditional first-year law curriculum. He insisted that the faculty comprise &quot;solely of persons who teach law in the strict sense of the word&quot; and using the casebook method. Harper agreed to these terms, and together with Beale assembled the faculty and designed the curriculum. Harper departed from the understanding he had reached with Ames and hired Freund to teach property law, and the law school&#x27;s curriculum was influenced by Freund&#x27;s interdisciplinary approach. The founding faculty members were Blewett Harrison Lee and Julian Mack, who had both taught at the law school of Northwestern University; James Parker Hall, who had taught at Stanford Law School and turned down an offer to teach at Harvard Law School; Clarke Butler Whittier, who had also taught at Stanford; Harry A. Bigelow, a notable scholar at Boston University who recognized limitations in the casebook method; and Freund.

===Founding and early period===

On October 1, 1902, the law school opened for classes in the University Press Building (currently the Bookstore Building). John D. Rockefeller paid the $250,000 construction cost, and President Theodore Roosevelt laid its cornerstone. At the time of its opening, the law school consisted of 78 students (76 men and two women). It offered courses in contract law, torts, criminal law, property law, agency, and pleading, with electives in administrative law, corporations law, federal jurisdiction, Roman law, international law, and legal ethics. The law school invented the J.D. degree, and was just one of five law schools in the U.S. that required a college degree from its applicants as a prerequisite to admission. Its library, which was established in short order, housed some 18,000 volumes of law reports. In 1903, a year after the law school opened, enrollment at the law school grew rapidly as its student body increased to 126. Floyd R. Mechem, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and pioneer in empirical legal studies at the time, joined the faculty and remained at the law school for 25 years until his death in 1928.

The law school prospered in its early years and fostered relationships with scholars in other fields, including economics, political science, psychology, and history. It also developed ties with members of the Chicago bar, who served as part-time faculty members and taught legal procedure and other practical courses. The law school&#x27;s academic standards were recognized as at least equal to those of Harvard. In 1904, the law school moved to Stuart Hall on the main university campus. In the same year, Sophonisba Breckinridge became the first woman to graduate from the law school––a feat that had not yet been achieved at Yale Law School, Columbia Law School or Harvard. In her autobiography, Breckinridge noted that &quot;the fact that the law school, like the rest of the University ... accepted men and women students on equal terms was publicly settled&quot;. The law school also established its first alumni association in this period.

The law school faced considerable change in the years leading up to World War I and shortly thereafter. Beale returned to Harvard after his two-year leave of absence. In 1909, the eminent jurist Roscoe Pound taught at the law school for a year. The law school established a chapter of the Order of the Coif in 1911 and the Edward W. Hinton Moot Court program in 1914. During World War I, enrollment declined: in Spring 1917, 241 students were enrolled; this number dropped to 46 by Fall 1918. In 1920, Earl B. Dickerson became the first African-American to graduate from the law school. The law school&#x27;s Black Law Students Association is named in his honor. Following the war, in 1926, enrollment reached 500 students for the first time. In 1927, the law school began to offer its first seminars. Its longest-serving dean, James Parker Hall, who played a significant role in recruiting numerous distinguished faculty members to the law school, died in office in 1928.
===Growth in interdisciplinary approach and the leadership of Edward Levi===
In the 1930s, new dean Harry A. Bigelow built on the interdisciplinary foundations laid by Freund and introduced classes in accounting, economics, and psychology. The law school&#x27;s curriculum was shaped by the emerging influence of the law and economics movement. Aaron Director and Henry Simons began offering economics courses in 1933. Faculty member Edward Levi also introduced economics in the antitrust course, permitting Director to teach one of every five classroom sessions. The first volume of the &quot;University of Chicago Law Review&quot; was also published in 1933. The law school established a legal writing program in 1938 and the Law and Economics Program in 1939. The LL.M. program was established in 1942, while Harry A. Bigelow Teaching Fellowships were established in 1947. As was the case during World War I, enrollment at the law school, like at many of the other top law schools in the country, declined and its academic calendar was adjusted to meet military needs.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the law school experienced a period of profound growth and expansion under the leadership of Edward Levi, who was appointed Dean in 1950. In 1951, Karl Llewellyn and Soia Mentschikoff joined the law school, the latter being the first woman on the faculty. Other notable scholars, widely regarded as institutional figures and leading thinkers in their respective areas, were Walter J. Blum and Bernard D. Meltzer, who studied and taught at the law school for their entire academic careers. Between 1953 and 1955, Supreme Court justice John Paul Stevens taught antitrust at the law school. In 1958, Director founded the &quot;Journal of Law and Economics&quot;. In 1959, the law school moved to its current building on 60th Street, designed by Eero Saarinen. In 1960, constitutional law scholar Philip Kurland founded the &quot;Supreme Court Review&quot;. Levi later served as the provost (1962–1968) and the president (1968–1975) of the University of Chicago, before becoming the United States Attorney General under president Gerald Ford. During his time at the law school, Levi also supported the Committee on Social Thought graduate program.

===Late 20th century===

By the 1970s and 1980s, the law and economics movement had attracted a series of scholars with strong connections to the social sciences, such as Nobel laureates Ronald Coase and Gary Becker and scholars Richard A. Posner and William M. Landes. In 1972, Posner founded the &quot;Journal of Legal Studies&quot;. The law school also established joint degree programs with the Committee on Public Policy Studies and the Department of Economics, complementing Max Rheinstein&#x27;s Foreign Law Program, which was established in the 1950s with a bequest from the Ford Foundation. The Legal History Program was established in 1981. In 1982, the Federalist Society was established by a group of students at the law school, together with students from Harvard Law School and Yale Law School. In 1989, the D&#x27;Angelo Law Library exceeded 500,000 volumes.

In the same period, many scholars who would later become leaders in their field joined the law school faculty at an early stage in their careers. Richard A. Epstein, identified in a &quot;Legal Affairs&quot; poll as one of the most influential legal thinkers of modern times, joined the faculty in 1973 and continues to serve as emeritus professor and senior lecturer. Geoffrey R. Stone, a leading First Amendment scholar and alumnus and former dean of the law school, joined the faculty in the same year. Douglas G. Baird, a luminary in bankruptcy law, has been on the faculty since 1980 and served as dean between 1994 and 1999. Cass Sunstein, regarded as &quot;the most cited legal scholar in the United States and probably the world&quot;, began his teaching career at the law school in 1981 and served as a faculty member for 27 years. Former U.S. Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia served as a professor between 1977 and 1982. His future colleague on the Supreme Court, Elena Kagan, began her career at the law school too, as did noted legal scholars Lawrence Lessig and Adrian Vermeule. The 44th President of the U.S. Barack Obama taught at the law school between 1992 and 2004 in the areas of constitutional law, racism and the law, and voting rights before he was elected to the U.S. Senate.

==Academics==
The law school currently employs more than 200 full-time and part-time faculty members and enrolls approximately 600 students in its Juris Doctor (J.D.) program. It also offers advanced legal degrees such as the Master of Laws (LL.M.) (or alternatively the M.C.L.), the Master of Legal Studies (M.L.S.) and the Doctor of Jurisprudence (J.S.D.). The J.D. degree may be combined with a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) or Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) with the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, a Master of Arts (A.M.) in international relations, a Master of Public Policy (M.P.P.) with the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, or a Master of Divinity (M.Div.) with the University of Chicago Divinity School.

The law school&#x27;s professors use the Socratic Method to facilitate learning in lectures and seminars. This method includes calling on students without prior notice, presenting hypotheticals, and continuously questioning them to test their knowledge and application of the material and to flesh out underlying assumptions in their responses. It is one of the few law schools in the United States that employs this mode of teaching, which is assisted by its low student-to-professor ratio.

===D&#x27;Angelo Law Library===
The D&#x27;Angelo Law Library is part of the greater University of Chicago library system. Renovated in 2006, it features a second-story reading room. The Law Library is open 90 hours per week and employs 11 full-time librarians and 11 additional managers and staff members. It has study space for approximately 500 people, a wireless network and 26 networked computers. It contains over 700,000 volumes of books, with approximately 6,000 added each year, including materials in over 25 languages, and primary law from foreign countries and international organizations.

==Admissions and cost==
Admission to the J.D. program is highly competitive. In 2021, the law school enrolled 175 students from an applicant pool of 6,514. Overall, the acceptance rate was 11.91% For the entering class of 2024, the 25th and 75th LSAT percentiles were 169 and 175, respectively, with a median of 172. The 25th and 75th undergraduate GPA percentiles were 3.82 and 3.98, respectively, with a median of 3.91.

Admission into the LL.M. program is also competitive. In 2020, the law school reported that it had received approximately 1,000 applications for 80 positions.

The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees and living expenses) at the law school for the 2017–18 academic year was $93,414.

==Grading==
The law school employs a grading system that places students on a scale of 155–186. The scale was 55–86 prior to 2003, but since then the law school has used a prefix of &quot;1&quot; to eliminate confusion with the traditional 100 point grading scale. For classes of more than 10 students, professors are required to set the median grade at 177, with the number of grades above 180 approximately equaling the number of grades below a 173.

In an article published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2010, business writer Catherine Rampell criticized other schools&#x27; problems with grade inflation, but commended Chicago&#x27;s system, saying that Chicago &quot;has managed to maintain the integrity of its grades.&quot;

Students graduate &quot;with honors&quot; by attaining a final average of 179, &quot;with high honors&quot; upon attaining a final average of 180.5, and &quot;with highest honors&quot; upon attaining a final average of 182. The last of these achievements is rare; typically only one student every few years will attain the requisite 182 average. Additionally, the law school awards two honors at graduation that are based on class rank. Of the students who earned at the law school at least 79 of the 105 credits required to graduate, the top 10% are elected to the Order of the Coif. Students finishing their first or second years in the top 5% of their class, or graduating in the top 10%, are honored as &quot;Kirkland and Ellis Scholars.&quot;

==Employment==
===Outcomes and career prospects===
In 2018, the law school was ranked first in the U.S. for overall employment outcomes by the &quot;National Law Journal&quot; and second in the U.S. for best career prospects by &quot;Forbes&quot;. According to the law school&#x27;s official 2020 ABA-required disclosures, 98.5% of the Class of 2019 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment within ten months of graduation. The median salary for its graduates in the Class of 2019 was $190,000, and 75% of graduates earned starting salaries of $190,000 or greater upon graduation.

===Judicial clerkships===
In 2023, University of Chicago Law School alumni comprised the third-highest percentage of recent graduates clerking for federal judges, after Stanford Law School and Yale Law School.

Between 1992 and 2017, it placed 88 alumni in Supreme Court of the United States clerkships. During the 2021-2022 Term alone, nine different Chicago alumni clerked for nine different justices on the Supreme Court of the United States. In the Class of 2019, 27.6% of its graduates secured clerkships (with 87.3% of those graduates in federal clerkships).

==Publications and organizations==

===Journals===
The law school produces seven professional journals. Four of those journals are student-run: the &quot;University of Chicago Law Review&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Journal of International Law&quot;, the &quot;University of Chicago Legal Forum&quot;, and the &quot;University of Chicago Business Law Review&quot;. The &quot;University of Chicago Law Review&quot; is among the top five most cited law reviews in the world. The other three are overseen by faculty: the &quot;Supreme Court Review&quot;, the &quot;Journal of Law and Economics&quot; and the &quot;Journal of Legal Studies&quot;.

===Academic paper series===
The law school produces several series of academic papers, including the Kreisman Working Papers Series in Housing Law and Policy, the Coase-Sandor Working Paper Series in Law and Economics, the Fulton Lectures, and the Public Law and Legal Theory Working Papers, in addition to a series of occasional papers.

===Organizations===
There are approximately 60 student-run organizations at the law school which fall under the umbrella of the Law Students Association. It is home to one of the three founding chapters of the Federalist Society. As a professor, former Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia helped to organize the Chicago chapter of the society. Chicago is also home to a large chapter of the progressive American Constitution Society for Law and Policy.

==Architecture==

The law school was originally housed in Stuart Hall, a Gothic-style limestone building on the campus&#x27;s main quadrangles. Needing more library and student space, the law school moved across the Midway Plaisance to its current, Eero Saarinen-designed building (next to what was then the headquarters of the American Bar Association) in October 1959. The building contains classrooms, the D&#x27;Angelo Law Library, faculty offices, and an auditorium and courtroom, arranged in a quadrangle around a fountain (mimicking the college Gothic architecture of the campus&#x27;s main quadrangles). The year saw a number of celebrations of the law school&#x27;s new home, including a filming of &quot;The Today Show&quot; and appearances by Chief Justice Earl Warren, Governor (and later Vice President) Nelson Rockefeller and Secretary-General of the United Nations Dag Hammarskjöld.

In 1987, and over the objections of the Saarinen family, the building was expanded to add office and library space (and the library renamed in honor of alumnus Dino D&#x27;Angelo). In 1998, a dedicated space for the law school&#x27;s clinics, the Arthur Kane Center for Clinical Legal Education, as well as numerous additional classrooms, were constructed. Renovation of the library, classrooms, offices, and fountain was completed in 2008, notable for the preservation of most of Saarinen&#x27;s structure at a time when many modernist buildings faced demolition.

<text>Super Tuesday is the United States presidential primary election day in February or March when the greatest number of U.S. states hold primary elections and caucuses. Approximately one-third of all delegates to the presidential nominating conventions can be won on Super Tuesday, more than on any other day. The results on Super Tuesday are therefore a strong indicator of the likely eventual presidential nominee of each political party.

The particular states holding primaries on Super Tuesday have varied from year to year because each state selects its election day separate from one another.

Tuesday is the traditional day for elections in the United States. The phrase &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; has been used to refer to presidential primary elections since at least 1976. It is an unofficial term used by journalists and political pundits.

==Background==
United States politics are dominated by two major political parties, the Democratic Party and Republican Party, which choose their presidential candidates in nominating conventions attended by delegates from states. State law determines how each party&#x27;s delegates are chosen in each state by either a primary election or a caucus and on what date those contests are held. State governments or state party organizations choose the date they want for their states&#x27; primary or caucus. 

With the broadened use of the modern presidential primary system, following the chaotic 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, states have tried to increase their influence in the nomination process. One tactic has been to create geographic blocs to encourage candidates to spend time in a region.

One motivation for the creation of Super Tuesday has been criticism and reform proposals of the current primary system, many of which argue for creating a National Primary or a regional primary, such as the Rotating Regional Primary System adopted by the National Association of Secretaries of State in 1999, among other proposals.

==1984: Beginnings of Super Tuesday==
The 1984 primary season had three &quot;Super Tuesdays&quot;. Decided on &quot;Super Tuesday III&quot; were delegates from five states: South Dakota, New Mexico, West Virginia, California and New Jersey. The proportional nature of delegate selection meant that Walter Mondale was likely to obtain enough delegates on that day to win the nomination at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, no matter who actually won the states contested. Gary Hart maintained that unpledged superdelegates that had previously announced support for Mondale would shift to his side if he swept the Super Tuesday III primary. 

Hart committed a &quot;faux pas&quot;, insulting New Jersey shortly before the primary day. Campaigning in California, he remarked that while the &quot;bad news&quot; was that he and his wife Lee had to campaign separately, &quot;[t]he good news for her is that she campaigns in California while I campaign in New Jersey.&quot; When his wife interjected that she &quot;got to hold a koala bear&quot;, Hart replied that &quot;I won&#x27;t tell you what I got to hold: samples from a toxic waste dump.&quot; While Hart won California, he lost New Jersey despite having led in polls by as much as 15 points.

Mondale secured the majority of delegates from the primaries, leading the way for him to take the Democratic presidential nomination. In the 1984 Republican Party primaries, incumbent President Ronald Reagan was the only candidate to secure delegates.

==1988: Southern states primary==
Proposals for holding the presidential primaries of southern states at once started in the 1970s in order to maintain and increase the region&#x27;s influence in presidential elections. It would allow for a conservative favorite son candidate from the south to receive a lead in delegate totals and produce momentum for the other primaries. Other southern presidential candidates had fared poorly in the initial contests in Iowa and New Hampshire which allowed more liberal candidates to gain the nomination.

Alabama, Florida, and Georgia designated the second Tuesday of March as the date for their presidential primaries and the Southern Legislative Conference lobbied other states to join. 864 Democratic and 564 Republican delegates came from the southern states in the 1988 primary. Frank Fahrenkopf, chair of the Republican National Committee, stated that &quot;Southern Democrats intended Super Tuesday to be a way to moderate their party&quot;, but that &quot;the Democrats have handed us a tremendous opportunity to win over the disaffected majority of their party&quot;.

Southern politicians formed the Democratic Leadership Council and hoped to have Governor Chuck Robb or Senator Sam Nunn seek the presidential nomination, but both declined. Michael Dukakis, Dick Gephardt, Al Gore and Jesse Jackson campaigned in the Super Tuesday states. Gephardt and Gore were both southerners, Jackson sought the high percentage of black voters in the region, and Dukakis focused on Texas and Florida where he could receive the support of Hispanic and northerners. Jackson won a plurality of the southern delegates with 286 followed by Gore&#x27;s 259. Seventy percent of Dukakis&#x27; 193 delegates from the south came from Florida and Texas, the only southern states he won.

Four hundred and fifty one delegates were selected in the Democratic primary before Super Tuesday. Dukakis held 14.2% of the delegates, Gephardt held 10.4%, Jackson held 6.2%, Gore held 3.8%, and the remaining candidates or uncommitted were 65.4%. After Super Tuesday Dukakis held 27.8% of the 1,638 delegates selected so far, Jackson held 24.2%, Gore held 21.2%, Gephardt held 8.7%, and the remaining candidates and uncommitted held 18.1%.

One hundred and seventy four delegates were selected in the Republican primary before Super Tuesday. George H. W. Bush held 35.1% of these delegates, Bob Dole 34.5%, Kemp 20.1%, and the other candidates 10.4%. After Super Tuesday Bush held 73.5% of the 959 delegates selected so far with Dole holding 17%, Kemp 4.1%, and the remaining candidates 5.4%. Bush&#x27;s victory in all but one state on Super Tuesday nearly secured him enough delegates to win the Republican presidential nomination. Bush won a majority of the vote in all southern states except for in three states, and received 85.7% of their delegates due to the primaries being winner-take-all. Pat Robertson&#x27;s campaign was weakened following a defeat in South Carolina and Super Tuesday.

Dukakis and Gore spent $3 million on the Super Tuesday states while Gephardt spent $1.5 million. Jackson was critical of the expensive requirements of running a campaign in all of the states. His campaign spent $447,644 in total for Super Tuesday, but Jackson noted how adequate advertising time in a single station in Dallas for a week would cost around $300,000.

The Southern Legislative Conference reported that in the eight months prior to Super Tuesday, the four Democratic candidates spent an average of 75 days in the south, while the three Republican candidates spent an average of 51 days. Gore spent 121 days in the south. Jackson was the only candidate that spent more time in the south than in Iowa and New Hampshire.

From 1996 to 2004, most of the Southern primaries were held the week after Super Tuesday, on a day dubbed &quot;Southern Tuesday&quot; by news commentators.

==1992==
In 1992, after losing earlier primaries, Democrat Bill Clinton won several Southern primaries on Super Tuesday en route to winning the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination and later the presidency. Incumbent George H. W. Bush faced opposition from Pat Buchanan in the Republican primaries that year.

==1996==
In 1996, Super Tuesday was on March 12. Bob Dole swept Super Tuesday en route to his bid for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination. Clinton, the incumbent president, secured all the delegates in the 1996 Democratic primaries.

==2000==
In 2000, Super Tuesday was on March 7. Sixteen states held primaries on Super Tuesday, the largest presidential primary election day in U.S. history up to that point. Approximately 81% of Democratic delegates and 18% of Republican delegates needed to secure nomination were up for grabs. Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush cemented their nomination bids with Super Tuesday victories, and both went on to win their parties&#x27; presidential nominations.

==2004: Mini-Tuesday==

In 2004, several states moved their presidential contests up to February 3, 2004, in order to increase the relative importance of their election results. Five states held primaries and two held caucuses and the day was eventually nicknamed &quot;Mini-Tuesday&quot; or Super Tuesday I by pundits. The traditional March Super Tuesday date, March 2, was christened Super Tuesday II, or just &quot;Super Tuesday.&quot; The results of Mini-Tuesday had far-reaching implications for the Democratic primaries. The Republican primaries were uncontested as incumbent President George W. Bush was the presumptive nominee.

==2008==

To increase importance of their votes, 24 states with over half the delegates to the national conventions moved to change their primary dates to February 5, 2008, creating the largest &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; to date. Newswriters and political pundits noted that it would dwarf the Super Tuesday primaries in previous cycles. Because of its political magnitude, some pundits have variously dubbed it &quot;Giga Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Mega Giga Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Tsunami Tuesday&quot; or even &quot;Super Duper Tuesday&quot;.

With only four states holding elections on the other Super Tuesday March 4, 2008, one pundit said &quot;Super Tuesday isn&#x27;t so super.&quot; 


==2012==
Super Tuesday in 2012 took place on March 6, 2012, totaling 419 delegates (18.3% of the total) in 10 states in the Republican primaries. The Democratic primaries were mostly uncontested as incumbent President Barack Obama was the assured nominee.

The impact of Super Tuesday was lessened by Mitt Romney&#x27;s convincing victories preceding Super Tuesday. Frontrunner Romney was able to increase his lead significantly, with wins in six states and won over half the delegates at stake. Santorum&#x27;s three wins, and a near-win in Ohio, allowed him to carry on as a candidate for another month.


== 2016 ==
=== Super Tuesday I ===


Super Tuesday in the 2016 presidential election was held on March 1, 2016. This date was dubbed the SEC Primary, since many of the participating states were represented in the U.S. Southeastern Conference for college athletics (five southern states).

The participating states included Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota (with caucuses), Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia. Additionally, Republican caucuses were held in Alaska, North Dakota, and Wyoming. The territory of American Samoa held a Democratic caucus.

The Republican candidates could win about half of the 1,237 delegates needed to secure their party&#x27;s presidential nomination. The two remaining Democrats were after 880 delegates, roughly one-third of those needed to win. The number of delegates from Texas is much greater than the other states: 155 for Republicans and 252 for Democrats.

The Democratic primaries and caucuses concluded with Hillary Clinton winning Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, and Bernie Sanders winning Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Vermont. Clinton received 486 delegates, and Sanders received 321.

The Republican primaries and caucuses concluded with Donald Trump winning Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont, and Virginia; Ted Cruz winning Alaska, Oklahoma, and Texas; and Marco Rubio winning Minnesota. John Kasich and Ben Carson were also in the election, but neither won any states. Results from the North Dakota and Wyoming caucuses were yet to be determined, as their delegates were not required to support the winners of those contests and can freely pledge to their preferred candidate during their respective state party conventions.

Additionally, several third-party primaries were held on March 1. The Libertarian Party hosted its caucus in Minnesota, which was won by Gary Johnson. The Green Party of the United States hosted two contests, a primary in Massachusetts and a caucus in Minnesota, both of which were won by Jill Stein.

=== Super Tuesday II ===

March 15, 2016, was dubbed Super Tuesday II, Mega Tuesday, or the Ides of March Primaries. Five states held both Democratic and Republican primaries: Illinois, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Missouri. Republican caucuses were also held in the Northern Marianas Islands. The Republican races were particularly significant as four of these, excepting the North Carolina primary, were the first in the cycle to use winner-takes-all voting systems. Republican contests held prior to March 14 were only permitted to use proportional systems. There were 697 delegates at stake for Democrats and 358 delegates for Republicans.

Some media sources referred to the contests on March 8 as Super Tuesday II, where two states held Democratic contests and four states held Republican contests, and referred to the March 15 contests as Super Tuesday III.


==2020==

Super Tuesday was on March 3, 2020. Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia all held their presidential primaries on that date. American Samoa had its caucus that day. As a territory it did not participate in the general election in November. The Democrats Abroad primary, for Democrats living outside of the United States, started voting on March 3, and concluded on March 10. 1,357, or 34.1%, of the 3,979 pledged delegates to be awarded to the candidates in the Democratic primaries were allotted on Super Tuesday. 1,617 total delegates were available to be awarded to the candidates. This was driven in large part by the two most populous states in the country, California and Texas, allotting 415 and 228 delegates, respectively, on Super Tuesday.

Joe Biden won Alabama, Arkansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Bernie Sanders won California, Colorado, Utah, and his home state of Vermont. Michael Bloomberg won American Samoa. Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard failed to win any contest.

In the Republican primaries, incumbent President Donald Trump defeated challenger Bill Weld in the Super Tuesday Republican primaries. Among the Super Tuesday states, Trump was uncontested in Maine and Minnesota, as both the Maine and Minnesota state Republican parties left Weld off their ballots. The Virginia Republican Party went a step further and decided to cancel its primary altogether and select their delegates directly at its state party convention.

==2024==

Super Tuesday took place on March 5, 2024. Iowa&#x27;s Democratic mail-in caucus finished accepting votes on Super Tuesday as well. 865 of the Republican delegates were chosen in these primaries and caucuses, while Democrats chose 1,420.

<doc id="453904" wikidata="Q2926338" url="?curid=453904" title="Brown &amp; Williamson">
<text>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation was a U.S. tobacco company and a subsidiary of multinational British American Tobacco that produced several popular cigarette brands. It became infamous as the focus of investigations for chemically enhancing the addictiveness of cigarettes. Its former vice-president of research and development, Jeffrey Wigand, was the whistleblower in an investigation conducted by CBS news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, an event that was dramatized in the film &quot;The Insider&quot; (1999). Wigand claimed that B&amp;W had introduced chemicals such as ammonia into cigarettes to increase nicotine delivery and increase addictiveness.

B&amp;W had its headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky, until July 30, 2004, when the U.S. operations of B&amp;W and BATUS, Inc. merged with R. J. Reynolds, creating a new publicly traded parent company, Reynolds American Inc. Some of its brands had been sold earlier in 1996 to the British tobacco company Imperial Tobacco and British American Tobacco.

B&amp;W was also involved in genetically modifying tobacco (notably the controversial Y1 strain).

==History==
===Early years===

B&amp;W was founded in Winston (today&#x27;s Winston-Salem), North Carolina, as a partnership of George T. Brown and his brother-in-law Robert Lynn Williamson, whose father was already operating two chewing tobacco manufacturing facilities. Initially, the new partnership took over one of the elder Williamson&#x27;s factories. In February 1894, the new company, calling itself Brown &amp; Williamson, hired 30 workers and began manufacturing in a leased facility.

In 1927, the Brown and Williamson families sold the business to London-based British American Tobacco. The business was reorganized as the Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation. Manufacturing and distribution were expanded, and work on a new B&amp;W factory in Louisville was begun.

===Acquisition===
On April 26, 1994, British American Tobacco Industries, PLC announced an agreement to buy American Tobacco Company for $1 billion. A holding company, named &quot;BATUS, Inc.&quot; was created for this purpose. On October 31, 1994, the Federal Trade Commission filed suit in federal court in Manhattan to stop the deal. An April 1995 consent order required that to prevent antitrust violations, Brown &amp; Williamson had 12 months to sell its Reidsville, North Carolina, plant and nine of the brands acquired in the American Tobacco purchase. Lorillard Tobacco Company agreed on November 28, 1995, to buy the six discount brands (Montclair, Malibu, Riviera, Crown&#x27;s, Special 10&#x27;s, and Bull Durham), but not the three premium brands (Tareyton, Silva Thins, and Tall). In an out-of-court settlement in December 1995, the FTC also required Brown &amp; Williamson to sell the Reidsville plant, but Lorillard did not want it and the company decided to close it.

The FTC rejected the Lorillard deal on April 10, 1996, and B.A.T. and Brown &amp; Williamson agreed July 25, 1996, to sell the six discount brands to Commonwealth Tobacco, LLC, a subsidiary of Commonwealth Brands, described as &quot;a small cigarette maker based in Bowling Green, Kentucky, specializing in low-priced, unadvertised brands.&quot; The deal would require FTC approval. Commonwealth Brands, which would also buy the Reidsville plant, started as Commonwealth Tobacco Company in 1991 and changed its name in November of that year, and is now part of Imperial Tobacco. B.A.T. and Brown &amp; Williamson claimed that since Commonwealth was not one of the five major U.S. cigarette companies, it would meet requirements that Lorillard did not, particularly since Commonwealth would be more likely to compete as a discount manufacturer. The FTC approved the $36 million deal in October.

==Controversies==

===Jeffrey Wigand&#x27;s employment with the company===
A battle in the war between the tobacco industry and smokers began with Jeffrey Wigand, a biochemist with a career focus on health issues, who became the Vice President of Research &amp; Development at Brown &amp; Williamson in 1989. He was hired to research safer means of delivering nicotine by reducing the harm of other tobacco compounds. At the time, both the addictiveness of nicotine and the health hazards of cigarettes were well known by the company and the industry, but were kept a fiercely guarded secret. Wigand soon found his research and recommendations discouraged, ignored and censored, leading to confrontations with the CEO, Thomas Sandefur. Thwarted and frustrated, Wigand turned his attention to improving tobacco additives, some of which were designed for &quot;impact boosting&quot;, using chemicals like ammonia to enhance absorption of nicotine in the lungs and affect the brain and central nervous system faster. Wigand believed this process was a deliberate attempt to increase addiction to cigarettes.

Wigand&#x27;s disagreements with Sandefur reached a breaking point over a flavor enhancer called coumarin, which he believed to be a lung-specific carcinogen that the company continued to use in pipe tobacco. Wigand demanded its removal, but a successful substitute had not been found and Sandefur refused on the grounds that sales would drop. This argument led Sandefur to fire Wigand in 1993 and to force him to sign an extended confidentiality agreement forbidding him to speak of anything related to his work or the company. The penalty for violating confidentiality was loss of his severance pay, potential lawsuits, and loss of medical coverage. At the time, his daughter suffered from a chronic illness which required continuous medical attention.

Soon after this incident, the seven executives of &quot;Big Tobacco&quot; testified during congressional hearings that they believed &quot;nicotine is not addictive&quot;.

===Marketing to children===
As early as 1972, Brown &amp; Williamson reviewed concepts for flavored &quot;youth cigarettes&quot;, with flavors including cola and apple flavors. In one of their internal memos, Brown &amp; Williamson advisers wrote &quot;It’s a well-known fact that teenagers like sweet products. Honey might be considered.&quot; Brown &amp; Williamson&#x27;s Kool menthol cigarettes were deliberately marketed to teenagers, as revealed by internal documents, which has led to a lawsuit brought by 28 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

===&quot;60 Minutes&quot;===
Despite Jeffrey Wigand&#x27;s commitment to honor the confidentiality agreement and his initial refusal to talk to Lowell Bergman, a producer for &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Wigand stated that he and his family were anonymously stalked, intimidated and threatened with death should he talk. At the time, it was thought that Brown &amp; Williamson were behind these intimidation attempts, but, just before the movie &quot;The Insider&quot; was released, Brown &amp; Williamson renewed its efforts to reduce Wigand&#x27;s credibility, and the FBI published a search warrant that was served on Wigand&#x27;s home, strongly suggesting he fabricated the threats against himself. This claim is countered by an on the record interview by Wigand where he points out the local FBI field office was being used by Brown &amp; Williamson via an ex-FBI agent to do dirty work for the company. Bergman provided him with armed bodyguards and, after legal consultation, urged him to testify for the State of Mississippi in a lawsuit against Big Tobacco brought by Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore, a tactic designed to nullify his confidentiality agreement before revealing the truth in an interview with Mike Wallace for &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. The tobacco interests responded by getting a Kentucky judge to issue a gag order that subjected Wigand to arrest upon returning to the Commonwealth.

Wigand&#x27;s best hope remained in Bergman&#x27;s pledge to air his story on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. Brown &amp; Williamson threatened CBS with a lawsuit for tortious interference, which could spoil an imminent merger plan with Westinghouse. Instead of the original interview, CBS aired an edited version which did not disclose the crucial details. Bergman bitterly opposed the breaking of his word to Wigand, which eventually led to his resignation from &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in 1998.

Brown &amp; Williamson still tried to sue Wigand for theft, fraud, and breach of contract after the sanitized interview was aired, and launched a 500-page smear campaign against him. However, his depositions at the Mississippi and Kentucky state courts were leaked, and were published by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; as part of an investigative rebuttal to the attacks. CBS News, embarrassed, finally aired the full, original Wigand interview on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, leaving much of the nation in shock.

Forty-six states ultimately filed a Medicaid suit against the tobacco industry, which led to a $368 billion settlement in health-related damages by the tobacco companies.

===&quot;Brown &amp; Williamson v. Regents of the University of California&quot;===
Thousands of pages of B&amp;W documents were donated unsolicited to the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Tobacco Control Archives in 1994. These documents consist primarily of scientific studies on the addictive nature of nicotine and other health effects of tobacco smoke. Also included is documentation of $500,000 in payments to Sylvester Stallone for promoting B&amp;W products in five of his films. B&amp;W sought to permanently remove the disputed material from the library with a suit filed in San Francisco Superior Court. The university contended that all of the documents were in the public domain and should be available to scholars and other interested parties. On May 25, 1995, the Superior Court ruled that these documents should be made available for public review. B&amp;W appealed that decision, and on June 23, 1995, the Court of Appeals refused a temporary restraining order preventing release of the documents. On June 29, the California Supreme Court rejected the company&#x27;s appeal, allowing UCSF to release the documents.

<doc id="453907" wikidata="Q859143" url="?curid=453907" title="Big Night">
<text>Big Night is a 1996 American comedy-drama film co-directed by Campbell Scott and Stanley Tucci. Set in the 1950s on the Jersey Shore, the film follows two Italian immigrant brothers, played by Tucci and Tony Shalhoub, as they host an evening of free food at their restaurant in an effort to allow it to gain greater exposure. The film&#x27;s supporting cast includes Minnie Driver, Ian Holm, Isabella Rossellini, and Allison Janney.

Produced by David Kirkpatrick and Jonathan Filley for the Samuel Goldwyn Company, &quot;Big Night&quot; was met with largely positive reviews and grossed $14 million worldwide. It was nominated for the &quot;Grand Jury Prize&quot; at the Sundance Film Festival and the &quot;Grand Special Prize&quot; at the Deauville Film Festival. Scott and Tucci won the New York Film Critics Circle Award and the Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best New Director. Tucci and Joseph Tropiano won the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay.

==Plot==
On the Jersey Shore in the 1950s, two Italian immigrant brothers from Calabria own and operate a restaurant called &quot;Paradise&quot;. One brother, Primo, is a brilliant, perfectionist chef who chafes under their few customers&#x27; expectations of Americanized Italian food. Their uncle&#x27;s offer for them to return to Rome to help with his restaurant is growing in appeal to Primo.

The younger brother, Secondo, is the restaurant manager, a man enamoured of the possibilities presented by their new endeavor and life in America. Despite Secondo&#x27;s efforts and Primo&#x27;s magnificent food, their restaurant is failing to gain success and recognition.

Secondo&#x27;s struggles as a businessman render him unable to commit to his girlfriend Phyllis, and he has recently been sleeping with Gabriella, the wife of a competitor. Her husband&#x27;s eponymous restaurant, &quot;Pascal&#x27;s&quot;, has succeeded despite (or perhaps due to) the mediocre, uninspired food served there.

Desperate to keep Paradise afloat, Secondo asks Pascal for a loan. Pascal demurs, repeating a past offer for the brothers to work for him, which Secondo refuses: he and his brother want their own restaurant. In a seemingly generous gesture, Pascal insists that he will persuade popular Italian-American singer Louis Prima to dine at Paradise when in town, assuming the celebrity jazz singer&#x27;s patronage will revitalize the brothers&#x27; business.

Primo and Secondo dive into the preparations for this &quot;big night&quot;, spending their entire savings on food, drinks and decoration, inviting numerous people (including a newspaper reporter and Primo&#x27;s love interest) to join them for a magnificent feast showcasing a timpano (a complex baked pasta dish). Primo pours his heart into every dish, lavishing care and great expertise on the cooking.

As they wait for Prima and his entourage to arrive, the dinner party indulges in the exquisite food and partakes in a fabulous celebration. Hours go by, however, and it becomes apparent that the famous singer is not coming, although the reporter, impressed by the food, promises to ask his newspaper to send a food critic to give the restaurant a boost. Phyllis catches Secondo and Gabriella kissing and runs off to the beach. At Gabriella&#x27;s insistence, Pascal admits that he never called Louis Prima, thus ending the party.

Secondo follows Phyllis to the beach where they have a final quarrel. Primo and Secondo have a fiery, heart-wrenching argument, chafing at their mutual differences. In the wee hours of the morning, Pascal admits to Secondo that he set the brothers up for failure, not as revenge for Secondo&#x27;s affair with Gabriella, but because the brothers would have no choice but to work for him. Secondo refuses him, saying they will never work for him.

As dawn breaks, Secondo silently cooks an omelette. When done, he divides it in thirds, giving one to Cristiano, one for himself, and leaving the remainder in the pan. Primo hesitantly enters, and Secondo serves him the last portion. Cristiano leaves, as the brothers begin to eat. They lay their arms across one another&#x27;s shoulders, and eat silently.

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 97% based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;The performances in &quot;Big Night&quot; are wonderful, and the food looks delicious.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the movie, &quot;a feast of a film done on a low budget with a menu featuring top-grade acting, writing and direction.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said of the film, &quot;&quot;&#x27;Big Night&quot;&#x27; is one of the great food movies, and yet it is so much more. It is about food not as a subject but as a language--the language by which one can speak to gods, can create, can seduce, can aspire to perfection.&quot;

<doc id="453910" wikidata="Q1686507" url="?curid=453910" title="Jeffrey Wigand">
<text>Jeffrey Stephen Wigand (; born December 17, 1942) is an American biochemist and whistleblower.

He is a former vice president of research and development at Brown &amp; Williamson in Louisville, Kentucky, who worked on the development of reduced-harm cigarettes and in 1996 blew the whistle on tobacco tampering at the company. This was adapted for 1999 film &quot;The Insider&quot;, with Russell Crowe portraying Wigand.

He currently lectures around the world and serves as a consultant for various tobacco issues.

==Early life, military service and education==
Wigand was born in New York City and grew up in the Bronx and later Pleasant Valley, New York. After a brief time in the military (including a short assignment in Vietnam), he earned a Master&#x27;s in Biochemistry and a PhD from the University at Buffalo in Biochemistry.

==Career==
Prior to working for Brown &amp; Williamson, Wigand worked for several health care companies, including Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson. In addition, he was employed as General Manager and Marketing Director at Union Carbide in Japan, and as a senior vice president at Technicon Instruments.

== Tobacco industry whistleblowing ==
Wigand became nationally known as a whistleblower on February 4, 1996, when he appeared on the CBS news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. He stated that Brown &amp; Williamson had intentionally manipulated its tobacco blend with chemicals such as ammonia to increase the effect of nicotine in cigarette smoke. According to Wigand, he was subsequently harassed and received anonymous death threats. 

Wigand had begun to work for Brown &amp; Williamson in January 1989. He was fired on March 24, 1993. He says that he was fired as a whistleblower because he knew that high-ranking corporate executives knowingly approved the addition of additives to their cigarettes that were known to be carcinogenic and/or addictive, such as coumarin.

Brown &amp; Williamson undertook a concerted effort to discredit Wigand, which included hiring Terry Lenzner&#x27;s company Investigative Group International, to produce a 500-page dossier on Wigand, which was distributed to the media. The dossier backfired, as news outlets examined the claims in it, finding many claims of misconduct to be unsubstantiated or trivial.

== Post-whistleblowing career ==
Following this he taught physical science, biology, and Japanese at duPont Manual Magnet High School in Louisville, Kentucky, in which job he was named the 1996 Teacher of the Year for the state of Kentucky .

Wigand no longer teaches high school and instead lectures worldwide to a variety of audiences including children, college, medical and law students, and a diverse group of policy makers. He has consulted with governments throughout the world on tobacco control policies.

==Media depictions==
He was portrayed by Russell Crowe in the 1999 film &quot;The Insider&quot; directed by Michael Mann, which also stars Al Pacino and Christopher Plummer. Crowe earned an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Wigand.

==Personal life==
He met his first wife, Linda, in 1970 while attending a judo class.

Wigand is now married to Hope Elizabeth May, an American philosopher, author, and lawyer who is a professor at Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, where they both now reside.

<doc id="453917" wikidata="Q7568540" url="?curid=453917" title="South Staffordshire Regiment">
<text>The South Staffordshire Regiment was a line infantry regiment of the British Army in existence for only 68 years. The regiment was created in 1881 under the Childers Reforms by the amalgamation of the 38th (1st Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot and the 80th (Staffordshire Volunteers) Regiment of Foot. The regiment saw service in the Second Boer War, World War I and World War II.

Reduced to a single Regular Army battalion after the Second World War, the regiment was amalgamated, in 1959, with the North Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales&#x27;s) to form the Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales&#x27;s) which was later, in 2007, amalgamated with the Cheshire Regiment and the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment to form the Mercian Regiment.

==History==
===Formation and antecedents===
The regiment was formed as part of the Childers Reforms on 1 July 1881 by the amalgamation of the 38th and 80th regiments of foot, which became the regular 1st and 2nd battalions of the South Staffordshire Regiment. Militia and Rifle Volunteers of south Staffordshire were also incorporated in the new regiment. The battalions formed in 1881 were as follows:
* 1st Battalion: the 38th (1st Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot, raised in Lichfield in 1705 as Colonel Luke Lillingstone&#x27;s Regiment, numbered as the 38th in 1751, and received the subsidiary title of &quot;1st Staffordshire&quot; in 1782.
* 2nd Battalion: the 80th (Staffordshire Volunteers) Regiment of Foot, raised in 1793 by Lord William Henry Paget from members of the Staffordshire Militia.
* 3rd (Militia) Battalion: 1st Battalion, King&#x27;s Own (1st Staffordshire) Militia
* 4th (Militia) Battalion: 2nd Battalion, King&#x27;s Own (1st Staffordshire) Militia
* 1st Volunteer Battalion: 1st Staffordshire Rifle Volunteer Corps
* 2nd Volunteer Battalion: 3rd Staffordshire Rifle Volunteer Corps
* 3rd Volunteer Battalion: 4th Staffordshire Rifle Volunteer Corps

The reserve battalions of the regiment were reorganised in 1908 by the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, with the two militia battalions becoming the 3rd (Reserve) and 4th (Extra Reserve) battalions of the Special Reserve. The three Volunteer Battalions transferred to the Territorial Force (TF); the 1st Volunteer Battalion formed the 1st North Midland Field Company, Royal Engineers, a few of the men joining with the 2nd Volunteer Battalion to form the 5th Battalion (TF) at Whittimere Street in Walsall, while the 3rd Volunteer Battalion formed the 6th Battalion (TF) at Stafford Street in Wolverhampton.

===Prior to the First World War===
The 1st Battalion (the former 38th) was sent to Egypt in 1882 as part of the British invasion of the country. On landing in Alexandria, it carried its colours through the city – this was the last occasion on which a British Army unit carried colours on active service. In 1885, the battalion travelled up the River Nile to Sudan in an unsuccessful attempt to lift the Siege of Khartoum. The battalion was subsequently involved in the defeat of Arab forces at Kirbekan.

The 1st Battalion then entered a long period of garrison duty in Gibraltar, Egypt, England and Ireland. They arrived home from Gibraltar in early February 1900. With the outbreak of the Second Boer War the previous year, the regiment was ordered to South Africa, arriving as part of the 8th Division in 1900. The battalion was mostly involved in minor skirmishes with the Boers, but suffered casualties due to disease and poor nutrition.

In 1904, the 1st South Staffords returned to the United Kingdom, being stationed in Ireland and England until 1911, when it moved to Gibraltar. While in Gibraltar, new colours were presented to the battalion by King George V on 31 January 1912. The battalion returned to South Africa in 1913.

The 2nd Battalion (the former 80th) was stationed in British India in 1881, soon moving to Tralee in Ireland, where it was involved in actions against Irish nationalists. It returned to England in 1883. It was then posted to The Curragh from 1889 to 1891, before travelling to Egypt, via Aldershot, in 1893. The battalion subsequently served in southern India and Burma until 1907, when it started a four-year posting in Pretoria, South Africa. The battalion returned to England in 1911.

The 3rd, Militia battalion, was embodied in May 1900, and disembodied in December the same year. They were again embodied in May 1901, and the following month 500 men embarked for service in South Africa during the Second Boer War. The battalion returned in July 1902.

The 4th, Militia battalion, was embodied in December 1899, and 650 men embarked in February 1900 for service in South Africa during the Second Boer War. They returned in August 1901, when they disembodied.

===First World War===
====Regular Army====
The 1st Battalion landed at Zeebrugge as part of the 22nd Brigade in 7th Division in October 1914 for service on the Western Front and then moved to Italy in November 1917. The 2nd Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 6th Brigade in the 2nd Division in August 1914 also for service on the Western Front.

====Special Reserve====
Both the 3rd and 4th Battalions remained in the UK training reinforcement drafts for the regular battalions. However, in October 1917 the 4th (Extra Reserve) Battalion landed at Le Havre to join 7th Brigade in 25th Division for service on the Western Front in the last year of the war.

====Territorial Force====
Both the 1/5th Battalion and 1/6th battalions landed at Le Havre as part of the Staffordshire Brigade in the North Midland Division in March 1915 for service on the Western Front before transferring to Egypt in January 1916 and then returning to France in February 1916. They crossed the St Quentin Canal to break through the strongest sector of the Hindenburg Line during the Battle of St. Quentin Canal in September 1918. Both the 2/5th and 2/6th battalions, part of the 176th (2/1st Staffordshire) Brigade of 59th (2nd North Midland) Division, were involved in hostilities in Dublin during the 1916 Easter Rising. Soldiers from the regiment murdered 16 unarmed men and boys in the infamous North King Street Massacre. They then landed at Le Havre in February 1917 for service on the Western Front.

====New Armies====
The 7th (Service) Battalion landed at Suvla Bay as part of the part of 33rd Brigade in the 11th (Northern) Division in August 1915. The 7th (Service) Battalion moved off to the south to dig a system of flanking trenches while other units forward from B beach, Suvla Bay. It was evacuated from Gallipoli in December 1915 and moved to Egypt before landing in France in July 1916 for service on the Western Front. The 8th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 51st Brigade in 17th (Northern) Division in July 1915 also for service on the Western Front. The 9th (Service) Battalion (Pioneers) landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as pioneer battalion for the 23rd Division in August 1915 also for service on the Western Front before transferring to Italy in November 1917.

===Inter-war period===
The 1st Battalion served in Singapore and Burma before being deployed to India in 1925 and to Sudan in 1927.

The 2nd Battalion moved to Cork in 1919, and was involved in the Irish War of Independence. It returned to England in 1923, where it remained until 1929 when it was posted to Palestine. It then moved to India in 1932.

The 3rd and 4th (Special Reserve) battalions were placed in &quot;suspended animation&quot; in 1921, eventually being disbanded in 1953. The Territorial Force was reconstituted as the Territorial Army in 1920, and the 5th and 6th battalions were reformed. In 1939, the size of the Territorial Army was doubled, with duplicate 2/6th and 7th battalions being formed.

In 1935, the South Staffordshire Regiment was granted the distinction of a badge backing of buff-coloured &quot;Brown Holland&quot; material. This commemorated the 57 years of continuous service by the 38th Foot in the West Indies from 1707 to 1764, and recalled the fact that their uniforms became so threadbare during their service in the tropics that they had to be repaired with pieces of sacking.

===Second World War===
====Regular Army battalions====

The regular battalions found themselves fighting in new roles: During the &quot;Chindits&quot; campaign in Burma, the 1st Battalion was part of the 77th Indian Infantry Brigade and were selected for conversion to the Chindits role and fought in Operation Thursday, the second Chindit expedition. During the expedition George Cairns, a lieutenant in the Somerset Light Infantry attached to the battalion was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. The battalion took part in jungle fighting against the Japanese forces. After serving as Chindits, they were transferred to the Parachute Regiment, becoming parachute infantry, and converted to the 16th Parachute Battalion. The battalion joined 50th Indian Parachute Brigade, part of the 44th Indian Airborne Division.

The 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment was initially serving in the 31st Independent Infantry Brigade until 1941 when it was converted to a Glider infantry role, serving as part of the 1st Airlanding Brigade in the 1st Airborne Division. As such, they landed in Sicily in 1943 where they, along with the rest of the brigade, which was temporarily down to two battalions, suffered heavy casualties during the disastrous Operation Ladbroke. Because of heavy casualties during Ladbroke the brigade did not participate in the invasion of Italy and were withdrawn to England to prepare for the invasion of France. They took part in Operation Market Garden, and played a significant part in the Battle of Arnhem in September 1944.

====Territorial Army battalions====
The 5th, 1/6th, 2/6th and 7th battalions, all Territorials, all served as part of the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division alongside battalions of the North Staffordshire Regiment. The 7th Battalion was part of 176th Brigade and the 5th, 1/6th and 2/6th were in 177th Brigade. The division was sent to France in late June 1944 to fight in the Battle for Caen. The division performed well and was considered by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery as one of the best in the 21st Army Group. However, due to a severe shortage of infantrymen in the British Army at the time, the division was broken up in August 1944 and its units were used as replacements for other British divisions who had suffered heavy casualties and the battalions were broken up and sent to other units.

====Hostilities-only battalions====
The regiment raised six other battalions before and during the war but these were used mainly in home defence roles or training units for the battalions overseas, or converted to other roles such as the 14th Battalion which was raised at Hereford racecourse in July 1940 was sent to guard the beaches at Great Yarmouth and Caister-on-Sea. In late 1942, it transferred to the Royal Artillery and converted into the 103rd Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery and trained in Scotland. However, the regiment was disbanded in August 1943. The 12th Battalion was converted to 91st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery and served with the 4th Infantry Division. Similarly, the 13th Battalion became the 104th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery. The 11th Battalion was raised in 1940 and joined the 209th Infantry Brigade as a training battalion. Following the end of the war, the 11th Battalion was posted to the Middle East where it was disbanded.

====Victoria Crosses====
Major Robert Henry Cain seconded to B Company, 2nd Battalion of the regiment from the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers was awarded the Victoria Cross for his participation during the Battle of Arnhem. From 17 to 25 September 1944, Major Cain&#x27;s company was cut off from the battalion and throughout the whole of this time was closely engaged with enemy tanks, self-propelled guns and infantry. The Major was everywhere danger threatened, moving among his men and encouraging them to hold out. By the end of the Battle, Cain had reportedly been personally responsible for the destruction or disabling of six tanks, four of which were Tigers, as well as a number of self-propelled guns. By his leadership he not only stopped but demoralized the enemy attacks and although he was suffering from a perforated ear-drum and multiple wounds, he refused medical attention. Major Cain&#x27;s conduct throughout was highly respected, both in terms of personal actions and leadership ability, and for this he was awarded the Victoria Cross; the only living man to receive this medal at Arnhem.

Lance-Sergeant John Daniel Baskeyfield of 2nd Battalion was also awarded the Victoria Cross. On 20 September 1944, Lance-Sergeant Baskeyfield was the NCO in charge of a 6-pounder anti-tank gun at Oosterbeek. When their battalion was attacked, Baskeyfield was badly wounded in the leg, and the rest of the crew were either killed or badly wounded. He refused an offer of transport to the Regimental Aid Post, in order to stay at his gun and encourage morale. After a brief respite, Baskeyfield again came under heavy fire; he refused to cower. After crawling under enemy fire to another 6-pounder gun, he was killed by a shell from a supporting enemy tank. Lance-Sergeant Baskeyfield&#x27;s body was never found, but there is a memorial statue of him at Festival Heights in Stoke-on-Trent, which was erected in the early 1990s.

The award of the Victoria Cross to both men made the 2nd Battalion the only British battalion to receive two VCs during one engagement in the Second World War.

===Post-war===
Following the granting of independence of India in 1947, line infantry regiments in the British Army were reduced to a single regular battalion. Accordingly, the 1st and 2nd Battalions amalgamated in Lichfield in 1948. The new 1st Battalion (38th/80th) travelled to Hong Kong in the following year, and thence to Northern Ireland two years later. Later that year, they were stationed with the British Army of the Rhine in West Germany. In 1954, the battalion was posted to the Suez Canal zone, before being speedily dispatched to Cyprus where hostilities had broken out between the two communities on the island. The 1st Battalion moved to its final posting, in Germany, in September 1957.

In July 1957, a defence review was announced. The South Staffords were to amalgamate with the North Staffordshire Regiment, and to become part of the new administrative Mercian Brigade. The amalgamation of the 1st Battalions of the two regiments took place on 31 January 1959 at Minden, Germany, to form the 1st Battalion, The Staffordshire Regiment.

Following the 1959 amalgamation of the North and South Staffords, the 5th Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment (TA) continued as a territorial unit of the new regiment without a change of title but was disbanded on the creation of the Territorial Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967.

<text>Karl Gustaf Patrik de Laval (; 9 May 1845 – 2 February 1913) was a Swedish engineer and inventor who made important contributions to the design of steam turbines and centrifugal separation machinery for dairy.

==Life==

Gustaf de Laval was born at Orsa in Dalarna in the Swedish de Laval Huguenot family (immigrated 1622 - Claude de Laval, soldier - knighted de Laval 1647). He enrolled at the Institute of Technology in Stockholm (later the Royal Institute of Technology, KTH) in 1863, receiving a degree in mechanical engineering in 1866, after which he matriculated at Uppsala University in 1867.

He was then employed by the Swedish mining company, Stora Kopparberg. From there he returned to Uppsala University and completed his doctorate in 1872. He was further employed in Kloster Iron works in Husby parish, Sweden.

de Laval was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences from 1886. He was a successful engineer and businessman. He also held national office, being elected to Swedish parliament, from 1888 to 1890 and later became a member of the senate. De Laval died in Stockholm in 1913 at the age of 67.

== Contributions ==

=== de Laval nozzle===
In 1882 he introduced his concept of an impulse steam turbine and in 1887 built a small steam turbine to demonstrate that such devices could be constructed on that scale. In 1890, Laval developed a nozzle to increase the steam jet to supersonic speed, working from the kinetic energy of the steam, rather than its pressure. The nozzle, now known as a de Laval nozzle, is used in modern rocket engine nozzles. De Laval turbines can run at up to 30,000 rpm. The turbine wheel was mounted on a long flexible shaft, its two bearings spaced far apart on either side. The higher speed of the turbine demanded that he also design new approaches to reduction gearing, which are still in use today. Since the materials available at the time were not strong enough for the immense centrifugal forces, the output from the turbine was limited, and large scale electric steam generators were dominated by designs using the alternative compound steam turbine approach of Charles Parsons. 
Using high pressure steam in a turbine that had oil-fed bearings meant that some of the steam contaminated the lube-oil, and as a result, perfecting commercial steam-turbines required that he also develop an effective oil/water separator. After trying several methods, he concluded that a centrifugal separator was the most affordable and effective method. He developed several types, and their success established the centrifugal separator as a useful device in a variety of applications.

=== De Laval cream separators and Alfa Laval ===
De Laval also made important contributions to the dairy industry, including the first centrifugal milk-cream separator and early milking machine, the first of which he patented in 1894. It was not until after his death, however, that the company he founded marketed the first commercially practical milking machine, in 1918. Together with Oscar Lamm, de Laval founded the company Alfa Laval in 1883, which was known as &quot;AB Separator&quot; until 1963 when the present name was introduced.

=== DeLaval ===
In 1991, Alfa Laval Agri, a company producing dairy and farming machinery was split from Alfa Laval when it was bought by the Tetra Pak Group. When Alfa Laval was sold, Alfa Laval Agri remained a part of the Tetra Pak group and was renamed DeLaval, after the company&#x27;s founder.

<doc id="453929" wikidata="Q311433" url="?curid=453929" title="Huayna Capac">
<text>Huayna Capac (; Cuzco Quechua: &quot;Wayna Qhapaq&quot; /ˈwajna &#x27;qʰapaq/ [ˈwajna &#x27;qʰapaχ]) (before 14931527) was the third Sapa Inca of Tawantinsuyu, the Inca Empire. He was the son of and successor to Túpac Inca Yupanqui., the sixth Sapa Inca of the Hanan dynasty, and eleventh of the Inca civilization. He was born in Tumipampa and tutored to become Sapa Inca from a young age.

Tawantinsuyu reached its greatest extent under Huayna Capac, as he expanded the empire&#x27;s borders south along the Chilean coast, and north through what is now Ecuador and southern Colombia. According to the priest Juan de Velasco he absorbed the Quito Confederation into his empire by marrying Queen Paccha Duchicela, halting a long protracted war. Huayna Capac founded the city Atuntaqui and developed the city Cochabamba as an agriculture and administrative center. The Sapa Inca greatly expanded the Inca road system and had many qullqa (storehouses) built.

Huayna Capac died in 1527, likely from a European disease introduced to the Americas by the Spaniards. The death of him and his eldest son Ninan Cuyochi sparked the Inca Civil War, in which his sons Huáscar and Atahualpa fought over succession as the next Sapa Inca. Tawantinsuyu fell to Spanish conquests shortly after Atahualpa&#x27;s victory.

==Names==
Huayna Capac&#x27;s original name was Tito Cusi Huallpa (Hispanicized spelling) Tʼitu Kuši Wallpa (reconstructed Classical Quechua) before ascending to Sapa Inca. Huayna Capac has many alternative transliterations, among the most popular ⟨Huaina Capac⟩, ⟨Guaina Capac⟩, ⟨Wayna Qhapaq⟩, and many others. The name comes from Quechua &quot;wayna&quot; &quot;young&quot; and &quot;qhapaq&quot; &quot;mighty, powerful&quot;, thusly &quot;the young mighty one&quot;, and not the other way around *&quot;the mighty young one&quot;.

Subjects commonly approached Sapa Incas adding epithets and titles when addressing them, such as Wayna Qhapaq Inka Sapʼalla Tukuy Llaqta Uya &quot;unique sovereign Huayna Capac, listener to all peoples&quot;.

== Background and family ==

The exact place and date of Huayna Capac&#x27;s birth are unknown. Though he was raised in Cuzco, he may have been born in 1468 in Tumebamba (modern Cuenca) and have spent part of his childhood there. He was the son of Túpac Inca Yupanqui (ruled 1471–1493) who had extended Inca rule north into present-day Ecuador, a process continued by Huayna Capac.

Huayna Capac&#x27;s first wife was his full sister, the Quya or Queen Consort Coya Cusirimay. The couple produced no male heirs, but Huayna Capac sired more than 50 legitimate sons, and about 200 illegitimate children with other women. Huayna Capac took another sister, Araua Ocllo, as his royal wife. They had a son they named Thupaq Kusi Wallpa, later known as Huáscar.

Other sons included Ninan Cuyuchi (the Crown Prince), Atahualpa, Túpac Huallpa, Manco Inca, Paullu Inca, Atoc, Konono, Wanka Auqui, Kizu Yupanqui, Tito Atauchi, Waman Wallpa, Kusi Wallpa, Tilka Yupanqu. Some of them later held the title of Sapa Inca, although some later Sapa Inca were installed by the Spaniards.

Among the daughters of Huayna Capac there were Coya Asarpay (the First Princess of the Empire), Quispe Sisa, Cura Ocllo, Marca Chimbo, Pachacuti Yamqui, Miro, Cusi Huarcay, Francisca Coya and others.

In addition to Kusi Rimay and Rawa Uqllu, Huayna Capac had more than 50 wives including Usika, Lari, Anawarqi, Kuntarwachu and Añas Qulqi.:143

==Administration==
As a &quot;boy chief&quot; or &quot;boy sovereign&quot;, Huayna Capac had a tutor, Wallpaya,:218 a nephew of Túpac Inca Yupanqui. This tutor&#x27;s plot to assume the Incaship was discovered by his uncle, the Governor Waman Achachi, who had Wallpaya killed.

In the south, Huayna Capac continued the expansion of Tawantinsuyu into what is now Chile and Argentina, and tried to annex territories towards the north in what is now Ecuador and southern Colombia.

According to the Ecuadorian priest Juan de Velasco Huayna Capac absorbed the kingdom of Quito into the Inca Empire. He supposedly married Paccha Duchicela, the queen of Quito.

Huayna Capac became fond of Ecuador and spent most of his time there, founding cities like Atuntaqui. Huayna Capac rebuilt Quito to make it the &quot;second capital&quot; of the empire, besides Cusco.

As Sapa Inca, he built astronomical observatories in Ecuador such as Ingapirca. Huayna Capac hoped to establish a northern stronghold in the city of Tumebamba, inhabited by the Cañari people. In the Sacred Valley, the sparse remains of one of Huayna Capac&#x27;s estates and his country palace called Kispiwanka can still be found in the present-day town of Urubamba, Peru.

In what is now Bolivia, Huayna Capac was responsible for developing Cochabamba as an important agriculture and administrative center, with more than two thousand silos (qullqas) for corn storage built in the area. Further north in Ecuador, Huayna Capac&#x27;s forces attempted to expand into the lowlands of the Amazon basin, reaching the Chinchipe River, but they were pushed back by the Shuar.

Huayna Capac acquired a special fondness for the central Peruvian Andes and its local highlights; he is recorded as having spent time relaxing in the Chinchaycocha lake on the Bombon plateau. Many Inca rafts were brought to the lake directly from Ecuador for his amusement. On its way to Cusco, after Huayna Capac&#x27;s death in Quito, the procession carrying his body stopped in the vicinity of Shawsha, a city in the central Peruvian Andes, acknowledging the fondness that he had felt for the region, and because the local inhabitants had been some of the most loyal to its causes.

Tawantinsuyu, or the Inca Empire, reached the height of its size and power under his rule, stretching over much of what is now Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, and southwestern Colombia. It included varying terrain from high frozen Andes to the densest swamps. His subjects spanned more than two hundred distinct ethnic groups, each with their own customs and languages. The empire spanned north to south, comprising the desert coast of Pacific Ocean on the west, the high Andes in the southeast and the forests of the Amazon Basin on the east. A dedicated ruler, Huayna Capac did much to improve the lives of his people. In addition to building temples and other works, Huayna Capac greatly expanded the road network. He had qollqa built along it for food so that aid could be quickly rushed to any who were in danger of starvation.

Huayna Capac knew of the Spanish arrival off the coast of his empire as early as 1515.

==Death and legacy==

Huayna Capac died in 1527. When Huayna Capac returned to Quito he had already contracted a fever while campaigning in present-day Colombia (though some historians dispute this), likely resulting from the introduction of European disease like measles or smallpox. The Spaniards had carried a wide variety of deadly diseases to North, Central and South America; and the Indigenous peoples had no acquired immunity against them. Millions of Central- and South Americans died in that epidemic including Huayna&#x27;s brother, Auqui Tupac Inca, and Huayna&#x27;s would-be successor and eldest son, Ninan Cuyochi. According to some sources, his sons Atahualpa and Huáscar were granted two separate realms of Tawantinsuyu: to his favorite Atahualpa the northern portion centered on Quito; and Huáscar the southern portion centered on Cusco. According to other sources, Atuahualpa was acting as provincial governor on behalf of his brother. The two sons reigned peacefully for four to five years before Huáscar (or possibly Atahualpa) decided to grab power.

Huáscar quickly secured power in Cusco and had his brother arrested. However, Atahualpa escaped from his imprisonment with the help of his wife. Atahualpa began securing support from Huayna Capac&#x27;s best generals, Chalcuchíma and Quizquiz, who happened to be near Quito, the nearest major city. Atahualpa rebelled against his brother and won the ensuing civil war, imprisoning Huáscar at the end of the war. Huayna Capac&#x27;s city of Tumebamba was destroyed during the war. The Spanish Francisco Pizarro and his men ascended into the Andes just as Atahualpa was returning to Cusco after the successful conclusion of his northern campaigns. After launching a surprise attack in Cajamarca and massacring upward of 6,000 Inca soldiers, Pizarro took Atahualpa prisoner. Pizarro&#x27;s ransom of Atahualpa and his subsequent execution marked the immediate turning point of the Spanish conquest of Tawantinsuyu.

==Lost mummy==

All the Inca emperors had their bodies mummified after death. Huayna Capac&#x27;s mummy was housed in his palace in Cusco and was seen by the Spanish conquistadors. Later, it was taken from Cusco to his royal estate of Kispiwanka where it was hidden from the Spanish by Huayna Capac&#x27;s relatives and servants. At some point it was taken back to Cusco, where it was discovered in 1559 by the Spanish. Along with mummies of 10 other Inca emperors and their wives, the mummy was taken to Lima where it was displayed in the San Andrés Hospital. The mummies deteriorated in the damp climate of Lima and eventually they were either buried or destroyed by the Spanish.

An attempt to find the mummies of the Inca emperors beneath the San Andrés Hospital in 2001 was unsuccessful. The archaeologists found a crypt, but it was empty. The mummies may have been removed when the building was repaired after an earthquake.

<doc id="453940" wikidata="Q465561" url="?curid=453940" title="Isabel Moctezuma">
<text>Doña Isabel Moctezuma (born Tecuichpoch Ichcaxochitzin; 1509/1510 – 1550/1551) was a daughter of the Aztec ruler Moctezuma II. She was the consort of Atlixcatzin, a &quot;tlacateccatl&quot;, and of the Aztec emperors Cuitlahuac, and Cuauhtemoc and as such the last Aztec empress. After the Spanish conquest, Doña Isabel was recognized as Moctezuma&#x27;s legitimate heir, and became one of the indigenous Mexicans granted an &quot;encomienda.&quot; Among the others were her half-sister Marina (or Leonor) Moctezuma, and Juan Sánchez, an Indian governor in Oaxaca.

Doña Isabel was married to one &quot;tlacateccatl&quot;, two Aztec emperors and three Spaniards, and widowed five times. She had a daughter out of wedlock whom she refused to recognize, Leonor Cortés Moctezuma, with conquistador Hernán Cortés. Her sons founded a line of Spanish nobility. The title of Duke of Moctezuma de Tultengo descends from her brother, and still exists.

==Biography==
===Family and early marriages ===

Doña Isabel&#x27;s mother was Princess Teotlalco and her birth name was Tecuich(po)tzin, translated as &quot;lord&#x27;s daughter&quot; in Nahuatl. Teotlalco was Moctezuma&#x27;s principal wife and, thus, among Moctezuma&#x27;s daughters Tecuichpotzin had primacy. As a small child, Tecuichpotzin was married to Atlixcatzin, who died by 1520. After her father was killed, either by his own people or the Spanish, she was quickly married to her uncle Cuitláhuac who became emperor after Moctezuma&#x27;s death. Cuitláhuac died of smallpox after only 80 days of rule. Cuauhtémoc became emperor and married Tecuichpotzin. She was only about eleven or twelve years old at the time of her third marriage.

=== Doña Isabel and the conquest of Tenochtitlan===

Hernán Cortés and other Spaniards entered Tenochtitlan on November 8, 1519. For several months they lived in Moctezuma&#x27;s palace. At some time during their sojourn there they took the emperor hostage. The Aztecs revolted and expelled Cortés and his army from Tenochtitlan (La Noche Triste, June 30, 1520). However, Tecuichpotzin was left behind in the city by the Spanish. Aztec leaders quickly married her to Cuitláhuac, the new emperor, and, after he died of smallpox, to Cuauhtémoc.

Cortés returned in 1521 with a large group of Spaniards and Indian allies, mostly from Tlaxcala, to attack Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs, their numbers and morale depleted by a smallpox epidemic, were defeated. Cuauhtémoc and his court attempted to flee Tenochtitlan by boat, but they were captured by the Spanish. On surrendering, Cuauhtémoc asked the Spanish to respect the ladies of his court, including his young wife Tecuichpotzin.

In 1525, Cortés executed Cuauhtemoc and Tecuichpotzin was widowed for the third time.

===Conversion to Christianity and Dynastic union to Spain===

Cortés valued Tecuichpotzin as a symbol of what he wished to portray as the continuity of rule between the Aztecs and the Spanish. She was instructed in Christianity, converted to Catholicism, probably in 1526, and baptized as Isabel, the name by which she would thereafter be known. Every indication is that Doña Isabel, the former Aztec princess Tecuichpotzin, was devout in her new religion. She gave generously in alms to the Augustinians, to the point that she was asked to stop. Isabel’s education as a Christian did not include teaching her to read and she remained illiterate.

Cortés arranged the marriage of Doña Isabel to his close colleague Alonso de Grado in June 1526. Part of the marriage arrangement was the granting of a large encomienda to Doña Isabel. The encomienda consisted of the city of Tacuba (about eight kilometres or five miles) west of Tenochtitlan (now called Mexico City) and was the largest encomienda in the Valley of Mexico, an indicator of the importance Cortés gave to Isabel. The encomienda of Doña Isabel endured for centuries. The Spanish and, later, Mexican governments, paid royalties in the form of a pension to the descendants of Doña Isabel until 1933 and a Count of Miravalle, the descendants of Moctezuma, still exists in Spain.

=== Regarding slavery ===

Her opposition to slavery has become a subject of interest lately. Isabel herself was a prominent slave owner, as was traditional in her lineage, but she freed all her slaves by the end of her life.

In July 1526 Cortés gave Alonso de Grado, Isabel&#x27;s husband, the position of &quot;Visitador Real&quot; – a traveling auditor with authority to exert judicial and executive power in the name of the crown – of New Spain. De Grado was given the specific mission of visiting all the cities and villages, to &quot;inquire about the process of Christianization, and make sure that the laws for the good treatment of the Indians – Laws of Burgos – were being respected. He was to prosecute and punish illegal enslaving. He was to focus on the illegal enslaving of natives, and on the disputes between Spanish civil servants and the local – native – authorities, and he was to send to prison any Spaniard that opposed him&quot;.

Alonso died while fulfilling this duty.

Isabel had close contact with the new laws through her husband. She was reported to be initially displeased with the attempts of the Spanish to impose limits in the ownership and treatment of slaves. Despite the growing body of law trying to limit or extinguish native slavery in New Spain that her husband was charged with enforcing, she, as native nobility, had the special privilege of retaining the slaves she owned prior to the conquest and treat them &quot;in her traditional ways”. She even had limited power to adapt the rules in the land of her encomienda. She used this privilege and owned a large number of native slaves throughout her life. However, by the end of her life she freed them all in her testament. In it she also ensured that they were given means to live after freedom.

The causes for this change of heart are uncertain, but set the basis for a recent portrayal of her as an anti-slavery &quot;activist&quot; and a mother of native independence in some ideological spheres. &quot;I want, and I order, and it is my will, that all my slaves, Indian men and women, born from this land, whom Juan Cano, my husband, and I hold as our own, as far as my right over them extends, shall be free of all servitude and captivity, and as free people they shall do as they will, for I don&#x27;t hold them as slaves; so if they are (slaves) I will and command for them to be free&quot;.

===Cortés, a child, and two more marriages===

Doña Isabel was described as “very beautiful” and “a very pretty woman for an Indian.” 
Her fourth husband, Alonso de Grado, soon died and Isabel, about seventeen years old, was widowed for a fourth time. Cortés took her into his household and she soon became pregnant. He quickly married her to another associate, Pedro Gallego de Andrade, and the child, christened Leonor Cortés Moctezuma (Isabel also had a half-sister named Marina or Leonor Moctezuma) was born a few months later. According to Spanish sources, she refused to recognize the child, who was placed in the care of Juan Gutiérrez de Altamirano, another close associate of Cortés. Cortés however accepted the child as his own and ensured that she was brought up well and received an inheritance from his and Doña Isabel’s estate.
Isabel’s marriage to Gallego produced a son, Juan de Andrade Gallego Moctezuma, born in 1530. However, Gallego died shortly thereafter. In 1532 she married her sixth husband, Juan Cano de Saavedra, by whom she had three sons and two daughters: Pedro, Gonzalo, Juan, Isabel, and Catalina Cano de Moctezuma. Isabel and Catalina became nuns at the first convent in the Americas, El Convento de la Concepción de la Madre de Dios. Both daughters were well-educated, as presumably were her sons.

===Death and inheritance===

Doña Isabel died in 1550 or 1551. Her estate was large, consisting not only of the encomienda, but also personal possessions she had acquired during her marriages with the Spaniards. Previous to those marriages, she had been an Aztec princess who owned nothing except her distinguished name. Her will is one of the few existing indicators of her personality. She directed that her Indian slaves be set free, one-fifth of the estate be given to the Catholic Church, and that all her outstanding debts, including wages owed to servants, be paid. She had acquired jewelry and other luxury items and requested that many of these be given to her daughters, and that other property be sold and one-third of the proceeds go to her daughters. As a deathbed wish, 20 percent of her estate was to be given to Leonor, her out-of-wedlock child by Cortés. This was apparently a dowry, as Leonor was married, or soon to be married, to Juan de Tolosa in Zacatecas.

Isabel willed the majority of her encomienda to her eldest son, Juan de Andrade, but his inheritance of her &quot;encomienda&quot; was disputed by her widower, Juan Cano, and Diego Arias de Sotelo, son-in-law of Leonor (Mariana) Moctezuma, who he claimed was Moctezuma&#x27;s true heir. The result after years of litigation was that Arias de Sotelo&#x27;s claim was dismissed, and Tacuba was divided between Cano and Andrade.

===Modern-day descendants===
The Miravalle line of Spanish nobility began with Isabel&#x27;s son, Juan de Andrade. Her sons, Pedro and Gonzalo Cano, became prominent citizens of Mexico City. Her son, Juan Cano Moctezuma, married into a prominent family in Cáceres, Spain, where the Palacio de Toledo-Moctezuma still exists.
Isabel&#x27;s last husband, Juan Cano, died in Seville in 1572.
The mestizo lineage that originates on Isabel and her sister branched out through Spanish nobility. Since converted native nobility were considered Spanish nobility by the Spaniards, the blood of Aztec nobility was highly respected, and the chance of intermixing with their lineage was treasured. Isabel and Leonor&#x27;s descendants quickly intermarried with the most important families of Extremadura, one of the richest areas of Spain at the time. It is estimated that Isabel has 2000 descendants today in Spain alone. The claims to nobility of the count of Miravalle, the count of La Enrejada, the duke of Ahumada, the duke of Abrantes, and the duke of Monctezuma come directly from her and her sister. Isabel is the ancestress of Rosario Nadal, the wife of Kyril, Prince of Preslav, Carlos Fitz-James Stuart, 19th Duke of Alba, Marie-Liesse Claude Anne Rolande de Rohan-Chabot, the wife of Prince Eudes Thibaut Joseph Marie of Orléans and Ignacio de Medina y Fernández de Córdoba, 19th Duke of Segorbe, husband of Princess Maria da Glória, Duchess of Segorbe, the former wife of Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia.

==Importance==
Very little is known about Doña Isabel beyond a few facts of her life. She seems to have made the transition from Aztec princess to Spanish doña successfully. Her descendants were the most prominent example of her day of mestizaje – melding Spanish and indigenous Mexican ancestries – that would characterize the future of Mexico. The Spanish wished to inculcate in the indigenous populations &quot;the economic, religious, and cultural orientation of Spain.&quot; Isabel, whether by desire or necessity, was the first great success of the assimilation of Spanish and native Mexicans.

<text>The L Word is a television drama series that aired on Showtime in the United States from 2004 to 2009. The series follows the lives of a group of lesbian and bisexual women who live in West Hollywood, California. The premise originated with Ilene Chaiken, Michele Abbott and Kathy Greenberg; Chaiken is credited as the primary creator of the series and also served as its executive producer.

&quot;The L Word&quot; featured television&#x27;s first ensemble cast of lesbian and bisexual female characters, and its portrayal of lesbianism was groundbreaking at the time. One of the series&#x27; pioneering hallmarks was its explicit depiction of lesbian sex from the female gaze, at a time when lesbian sex was &quot;virtually invisible elsewhere on television.&quot; It was also the first television series written and directed by predominantly queer women.

&quot;The L Word&quot; franchise led to the spin-off reality show &quot;The Real L Word&quot; (2010–2012) as well as the documentary film &quot;L Word Mississippi: Hate the Sin&quot; (2014), both of which aired on Showtime. A sequel television series, &quot;The L Word: Generation Q&quot;, debuted in December 2019 and was canceled after three seasons in 2023.

==Production==
&quot;The L Word&quot; was co-created by Ilene Chaiken, Michele Abbott, and Kathy Greenberg; Chaiken served as the primary creator and executive director of the series, as well as a writer and director. Steve Golin and Larry Kennar served as additional executive producers, while Guinevere Turner, Susan Miller, Cherien Dabis, and Rose Troche were among the series&#x27; writers.

The series premiered on Showtime on January 18, 2004 and ran for a total of six seasons, airing its finale on March 8, 2009. &quot;The L Word&quot; was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia at Coast Mountain Films Studio, as well as on location in Los Angeles, California.

==Series overview==
===Cast and characters===

===Title===
Contemporary use of the phrase &quot;the L word&quot; as an alias for &quot;lesbian&quot; dates to at least the 1981 play &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot; by Jane Chambers, in which a character stammers out: &quot;You&#x27;re really...? The L-word? Lord God, I never met one before.&quot;

The original code-name for &quot;The L Word&quot; was &quot;Earthlings&quot;, a rarely used slang term for lesbians.

===&quot;The Chart&quot;===

&quot;The Chart&quot;, an undirected labeled graph in which nodes represent individuals and lines represent affairs or hookups, is a recurring plot element throughout the series. Originally, &quot;The L Word&quot; was to be based around a lesbian, Kit Porter, and &quot;The Chart&quot; was tattooed on her back.

The idea for the chart was formed in the L word&#x27;s writers room. The creators of the show were discussing their own mutual friends and who had had romantic entanglements with whom. This led to them creating a beta version of what the chart comes to be on a piece of paper. The writers eventually decide to incorporate this chart into the show.

In season 4, Alice launches The Chart as a social networking service. Concurrently, a real-world parallel project OurChart.com was created. The website, which allowed registered members to create their own profiles and hosted several blogs on the show, operated from the beginning of season four until the end of season six, after which the site was discontinued and redirected to Showtime&#x27;s official website.

==Plot==
===Season 1===

The first season of &quot;The L Word&quot; premiered on January 18, 2004 and ended on April 11, 2004. The season introduces Bette Porter and Tina Kennard, a couple in a seven-year relationship attempting to have a child; Marina Ferrer, owner of the local cafe The Planet; Jenny Schecter, who has recently moved to Los Angeles to live with her boyfriend Tim Haspell; Shane McCutcheon, an androgynous, highly sexual hairstylist; Alice Pieszecki, a bisexual journalist who maintains The Chart; Dana Fairbanks, a closeted professional tennis player; and Kit Porter, Bette&#x27;s straight half-sister.

===Season 2===

The second season of &quot;The L Word&quot; premiered on February 20, 2005 and ended on May 15, 2005. The season introduces Carmen de la Pica Morales, a DJ who becomes part of a love triangle with Shane and Jenny; Helena Peabody, a wealthy art patron who becomes a rival to Bette and love interest to Tina (while she and Bette are separated).

Major story lines in the season include Tina&#x27;s pregnancy following a second insemination, culminating in Tina and Bette&#x27;s reconciliation at the end of the season; the introduction of Mark Wayland, a documentary filmmaker who moves in with Shane and Jenny and Kit&#x27;s acquisition of The Planet following Marina&#x27;s departure from Los Angeles; Shane and Jenny becoming the unknowing subjects of Mark&#x27;s documentary after he places hidden cameras in their home; a developing relationship between Alice and Dana; and insights into Jenny&#x27;s past as an abused child.

===Season 3===

The third season of &quot;The L Word&quot; premiered on January 8, 2006 and ended on March 26, 2006. The season introduces Max Sweeney, a working-class trans man initially introduced presenting as a butch; and Angus Partridge, a male nanny who becomes Kit&#x27;s lover.

The season is set six months after the birth of Tina and Bette&#x27;s daughter Angelica. Major story lines include Bette and Tina&#x27;s relationship deteriorating once again, due to Tina developing feelings for men; Max coming out as a trans man; Dana&#x27;s diagnosis with and ultimate death from breast cancer; and Shane and Carmen&#x27;s engagement and wedding, which ends when Shane abandons Carmen at the altar. Helena is integrated into the primary group of characters as a friend rather than a rival; she acquires a movie studio, where she is entangled in a sexual harassment lawsuit that leads her mother to cut her off financially.

In the lead-up to the third season, the fan fiction website FanLib.com launched a contest where individuals could submit a piece of &quot;L Word&quot; fanfiction, with the winner&#x27;s story incorporated into a scene in third-season episode.

===Season 4===

&quot;The L Word&quot; was renewed for a fourth season on February 2, 2006, and began filming on May 29, 2006. The season aired from January 7, 2007 to March 25, 2007, and introduces Jodi Lerner, a love interest for Bette; Phyllis Kroll, Bette&#x27;s closeted new boss at California Art College; Paige Sobel, a love interest for Shane; Tasha Williams, a former captain in the Army National Guard and love interest for Alice; and Papi, who has slept with the most women on The Chart. Karina Lombard reprises her role for two episodes.

Major story lines in the season include the adaptation of &quot;Lez Girls&quot;, an article written by Jenny for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, into a film; Bette taking a job as a dean at California Art College; and Tasha&#x27;s struggle to reconcile her military service with her sexuality under don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell.

===Season 5===

&quot;The L Word&quot; was renewed for a fifth season on March 9, 2007, and began filming in summer 2007. The season aired from January 6, 2008 to March 23, 2008 and introduces Nikki Stevens, a closeted gay actress who portrays the lead role in &quot;Lez Girls.&quot; Adele Channing is also introduced, potentially by chance meeting Jenny at the Planet, and soon becoming her personal assistant. Papi and Angus were written out of the series.

Major story lines in the season include Bette and Tina reconciling their relationship, Jenny being ousted from the production of &quot;Lez Girls&quot;, and Tasha&#x27;s dishonorable discharge from the military.

===Season 6===

The sixth and final season of &quot;The L Word&quot; aired from January 18, 2009 to March 8, 2009. The season introduces Kelly Wentworth, Bette&#x27;s college roommate, who attempts to open a gallery with her; Jamie Chen, a social worker who becomes involved in a love triangle with Alice and Tasha; and Marybeth Duffy and Sean Holden, detectives with the LAPD.

The season is a whodunit story line focused on the murder of Jenny. The events of the season are depicted as a flashback leading up to the night of the crime, with each episode focused around what could have potentially motivated each character to have killed Jenny. The series concludes without revealing the identity of her murderer.

====Interrogation tapes====
Following the series finale of &quot;The L Word&quot;, Showtime released a series of seven short videos depicting Bette, Alice, Tina, Nikki Shane being questioned by the police over Jenny&#x27;s murder. The episodes were posted weekly on Showtime&#x27;s website. Showtime additionally released an interview with &quot;L Word&quot; series creator Ilene Chaiken, released in two weekly installments. In the interview, Chaiken stated that Alice went to jail for Jenny&#x27;s murder, but was not necessarily guilty of the crime.

=== &quot;Generation Q&quot; ===
On July 11, 2017, it was announced a sequel series was in the works with Showtime. Marja-Lewis Ryan has been selected to serve as executive producer and showrunner. On January 31, 2019, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported Showtime had picked up the sequel series for a premiere later in the year, in which Jennifer Beals, Katherine Moennig, and Leisha Hailey would reprise their roles. Other sources, such as &quot;TVLine&quot;, call the eight-episode order a revival, so the nature of the follow-up is unclear. The new series, titled &quot;The L Word: Generation Q&quot;, premiered in the fall of 2019.

==Related media==
===&quot;The Farm&quot;===
In July 2008, Showtime CEO Matthew Blank announced that the network would shoot a pilot for &quot;The Farm&quot;, an &quot;L Word&quot; spin-off series based on a pitch from &quot;L Word&quot; series creator Ilene Chaiken. Set in a women&#x27;s prison, the series was slated to star Famke Janssen, Melissa Leo, Laurie Metcalf, and Leisha Hailey, the lattermost of whom would reprise her role as Alice Pieszecki. The pilot was shot in December 2008. In April 2009, Showtime declined to pick up &quot;The Farm&quot; for a full series order.

===&quot;The Real L Word&quot;===

&quot;The Real L Word&quot;, a reality television series produced by Chaiken, aired on Showtime from June 20, 2010 to September 6, 2012. The series, initially set in Los Angeles and later in Brooklyn, New York City, followed a group of real-life gay women.

===&quot;L Word Mississippi: Hate the Sin&quot;===
&quot;L Word Mississippi: Hate the Sin&quot;, a documentary directed by Lauren Lazin and produced by Chaiken, premiered on Showtime on August 8, 2014. The documentary, which follows a group of LGBT women in rural Mississippi, won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Documentary in 2015.

==Music==

EZgirl served as &quot;The L Word&quot;&#x27;s music composer, while Natasha Duprey served as music supervisor. A total of five soundtracks were produced.

All three of Leisha Hailey&#x27;s bands were referenced in the series: a song by The Murmurs was used in the first season, Shane wears a shirt for Gush in the second season. Songs by Uh Huh Her were featured in the show&#x27;s fifth and sixth seasons; Tasha is seen wearing an Uh Huh Her t-shirt during the sixth season.

The band Betty wrote and performed the theme song, which is first introduced in season two. Betty makes numerous appearances in the show, and their music is featured throughout the series.

==Reception==
The show&#x27;s first season was &quot;broadcast to critical acclaim and instant popularity&quot;; as an article from &quot;The New York Times&quot; pointed out:
Co-creator and executive producer Ilene Chaiken had some issues with the reaction:
While the show was seen as fulfilling gay characters&#x27; &quot;obvious and modest representational need&quot; or even the &quot;ferocious desire not only to be seen in some literal sense... but to be seen with all the blood and angst and magic that you possess&quot;, the show was criticized for various scenes which served to &quot;reify heteronormativity&quot;. The show was also praised for its nuanced consideration (in the first season) of how and in what ways gay women should stand up to the religious right, with the &quot;Provocations&quot; art show story line being &quot;a fictionalized version of what happened when Cincinnati&#x27;s Contemporary Art Center booked a controversial exhibition of Mapplethorpe photographs in 1990&quot;.

As the series progressed, however, reviews became far more negative. By the time the sixth and final season began, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the show a &quot;Sapphic &quot;Playboy&quot; fantasia&quot; that has &quot;shown little interest in variegating portrayals of gay experience. Instead it has seemed to work almost single-mindedly to counter the notion of &quot;lesbian bed death&quot; and repeatedly remind the viewer of the &quot;limits and tortures of monogamy&quot; while &quot;never align[ing] itself with the traditionalist ambitions [for same-sex marriage] of a large faction of the gay rights movement&quot;. The decision to make the final season into a murder mystery which was ultimately left unresolved was also met with negative response.

The series currently holds a 57% &quot;Rotten&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

==Cultural impact and legacy==
&quot;The L Word&quot; broke new ground as the first television series to feature an ensemble cast made up of lesbian and bisexual female characters. Similarly, it was also the first television series to be written and directed predominantly by queer women. The series has been lauded for revolutionizing the depiction of queer women on television, particularly for its portrayal of a queer community at a time when lesbian representation was often relegated to a single lesbian character amid an otherwise heterosexual cast. One of the pioneering hallmarks of the series was its graphic lesbian sex scenes from the female gaze, at a time when lesbian sex was &quot;virtually invisible elsewhere on television.&quot;

Several shows have referenced &quot;The L Word&quot;, including &quot;South of Nowhere&quot;&#x27;s first season episode &quot;Girls Guide to Dating&quot;; &quot;According to Jim&quot;; the medical drama &quot;House&quot;; the first season finale of &quot;Weeds&quot;, Jon Stewart&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Show&quot; (July 24, 2006); &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show: The &quot;Lost Episodes&quot;&quot;; &quot;The Sopranos&quot; episode &quot;Live Free or Die&quot;; the American version of &quot;The Office&quot;; &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; fourth season episode &quot;Scene in a Mall&quot;; &quot;The Big Gay Sketch Show&quot;; &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;You Kent Always Say What You Want&quot;; and &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Brian Sings and Swings&quot;. Also, movies such as &quot;Puccini for Beginners&quot;, &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;, and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Think Straight&quot; have made mention of &quot;The L Word&quot; as to reference lesbians but considers the term is sometimes used as slander.

===Awards and honors===
In 2004, Laurel Holloman won a Satellite Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama. The show was also for a Satellite Award for Best Television Series – Drama in the same year. In the second season, Ossie Davis received a posthumous Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series in recognition of his portrayal of Bette and Kit Porter&#x27;s father, Melvin. The show received multiple nominations for GLAAD Media Awards, and both Pam Grier and Jennifer Beals were repeatedly nominated for NAACP Image Awards.

In 2006, &quot;The L Word&quot; won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Drama Series. It was consequently honored with a Special Recognition Award in 2009 from the same organization.

In 2008, &quot;The L Word&quot;&#x27;s companion website was honored at the 59th Annual Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Advanced Media Technology for Best Use of Commercial Advertising on Personal Computers.

<doc id="453943" wikidata="Q1054387" url="?curid=453943" title="Centre Democrats (Netherlands)">
<text>The Centre Democrats (, CD) was a political party in the Netherlands. Founded in 1984 by members who split out from the Centre Party (CP), the Centre Democrats was joined one month later by the only CP Member of Parliament—Hans Janmaat. Janmaat went on to become the leader of the party, which subsequently became strongly centered on his person. The newly formed Centre Democrats represented the more moderate faction of the Centre Party, but espoused an anti-immigration and nationalist ideology. Their claims of standing in the centre of the political landscape have thus been disputed by political scientists.

The Centre Democrats did not gain enough votes for parliamentary representation in the 1986 general election, but Janmaat won back his seat after the following election in 1989. In 1994 he was joined by two additional representatives won by the party. The CD was subject to a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; by the other parties in Parliament, although some parties rather sought to confront it following its 1994 success. The CD failed to win any seats in the 1998 election, and it fell into disarray until it was finally dissolved in 2002.

==History==
===Early years (1984–1989)===
The Centre Democrats was founded on 7 November 1984 by a few low-key members who broke away from the Centre Party (CP). On 5 December the same year the only Member of Parliament for the Centre Party, Hans Janmaat, changed party to the Centre Democrats and became its seventh member. Janmaat believed that by steering a more moderate course, the Centre Party would attract more voters at the polls, but was expelled by the party&#x27;s hardliners. In an attempt to appear more mainstream than the Centre Party, the new Centre Democrats&#x27; slogans were more moderate and less explicit. As opposed to the Centre Party&#x27;s &quot;Eigen volk eerst&quot; (&quot;Our People First&quot;), the Centre Democrats&#x27; manifesto used the Dutch proverb &quot;Oost West Thuis Best&quot; (&quot;East, West, Home Best&quot;). After Janmaat joined the Centre Democrats, the party became known as &quot;his&quot; party. Despite widespread media coverage generated by Janmaat&#x27;s reputation, party membership remained small in the first few years.
During its early years, the Centre Democrats received extensive media attention on two occasions. The first occurred when the Centre Democrats and Centre Party met on 29 March 1986 in Kedichem. A group of anti-fascist activists believed that the two parties were planning to merge, and firebombed the hotel where the meeting was held. The venue was severely damaged, Janmaat narrowly escaped death and the party secretary Wil Schuurman had one leg amputated after jumping from a window to escape the conflagration.

Janmaat&#x27;s attempt to be reinstated as a teacher at his old school following his failed re-election to parliament led to the second media frenzy. Although he was legally permitted to go back to his job, the protests of some students and parents due to his reputation as a &quot;racist&quot;, led him to be bought off by the court from pursuing a return to his old job. Unable to go back to his former job, Jaanmaat returned to politics. Taking advantage of Janmaat&#x27;s profile, the Centre Democrats contested the 1986 general election under the name &quot;Lijst Janmaat/Centrumdemocraten&quot;, but gained just 0.1% of the vote and no parliamentary seat. The Centre Democrats failed in its attempt to win votes from the Centre Party, which gained 0.4% of the vote but also did not win a seat.

===In parliament (1989–1998)===

Following the 1986 election, the Centre Democrats worked on improving both its image and its grassroots support. The strategy paid off with Janmaat winning a seat in the House of Representatives in the 1989 general election. By contesting the election in all nineteen constituencies, the party won the right to state-sponsored television and radio time but still had no more than 300 registered members. In the 1990 local elections the Centre Democrats won eleven seats, then, in the 1991 provincial elections, three seats in the provincial parliament.

Electoral success overtook the party and Janmaat began to make controversial statements in the media. Based on his conviction that high office should be restricted to third-generation Dutch nationals, he suggested that several cabinet ministers, including Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch-Ballin who was of Jewish descent, and Agriculture State Secretary Dzsingisz Gabor who was of Hungarian descent, should be removed from the Dutch leadership. This marked the start of prosecutions of Centre Democrats party members on charges of racism, as well as the decision by the other parties in Parliament and government to place a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; around the party.

The &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; turned out to be counterproductive with the Centre Democrats winning 77 seats in the 1994 local elections and gaining representation in almost every city where it fielded a candidate. Large cities were strongholds of the party, winning more than 10% of the vote in Rotterdam. It became the fifth largest Dutch political party. After the elections, however, scandal loomed over the Centre Democrats, largely because of its weak organization and lack of active party members. Many of its previously won local seats became vacant after a while, as elected representatives failed to take them up, joined or founded other parties, left the party or left politics altogether. Before the 1994 general election opinion polls predicted that the party could win more than five seats in the House of Representatives. However, media reports claiming that some newly elected local members had extremist pasts damaged the Centre Democrats&#x27; prospects. A secret recording broadcast on national television one week before the election showed an Amsterdam council member bragging about having set immigrant centers on fire in the early 1980s. In the election that followed, the Centre Democrats won 2.5% of the vote and three seats in the House of Representatives (Janmaat was joined by Wil Schuurman and Cor Zonneveld), well below earlier expectations. Janmaat claimed that the relatively poor result was a result of an anti-CD campaign in the media. Due to its growth, and questions arising amongst the other parties over the development of a multicultural society, political opponents began to confront the Centre Democrats directly rather than maintain a strict &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; around it.

Despite attempts to broaden their appeal, the issue of foreigners remained central to the party&#x27;s rhetoric. Janmaat was convicted of &quot;inciting racial hatred&quot; by the Dutch courts for speaking out against multiculturalism. His conviction later came to be seen as unwarranted by mainstream observers. Janmaat and Schuurman, who were to marry in 1996, dominated the party. With Schuurman&#x27;s son head of the party office, the Centre Democrats became almost a family affair. Janmaat remained skeptical of initiatives outside his own control, and expelled multiple local council members from the party. While much of this was due to local cooperation—unauthorized by the Centre Democrats leadership—with the more radical Centre Party &#x27;86 (CP&#x27;86), Janmaat later agreed to coordinate joint demonstrations with it. The cooperation soon fell apart and Janmaat distanced himself from CP&#x27;86 as the 1998 election approached.

In the 1995 provincial elections, in the face of competition from four new ethnocentric competitors, none of which won a seat, the Centre Democrats did not increase its three-seat presence in the provincial parliament. In the 1998 local elections the Centre Democrats lost all but one of its seats, having contested the election in just around half of the municipalities it contested in 1994. In the 1998 general election two months later, the party lost all its seats in Parliament. This was as a result of the Centre Democrats&#x27;s failure to benefit from increased attention on immigration issues, its years of internal infighting, and new legislation directed mainly against the far-right, which had raised the number of signatures per district required in order to contest elections.

===Demise (1998–2002)===
After the 1998 election, Janmaat became increasingly worried by legal pressure, believing that the Centre Democrats could become the government&#x27;s next target after CP&#x27;86 was officially banned in 1998. He founded the &quot;Conservative Democrats&quot; as a potential successor party in the event that the Centre Democrats was proscribed. The new party contested the 1999 European elections as the , a supposed two-party cooperation, where the two names in reality represented the same party. It won only 0.5% of the vote in the election, a showing widely seen as the last spasm of a dying party. Janmaat&#x27;s increasing physical exhaustion only served to exacerbate the situation. Nonetheless, with a new political climate following the September 11 attacks and the rise of Pim Fortuyn, Janmaat sought political rehabilitation in his final years. The reason was that his earlier criminal convictions arose from stating things that had now become accepted.

On 18 April 2002, only a few months before Janmaat died, the party was formally dissolved. As a result, it did not participate in the 2002 general election, where the recently emerged Pim Fortuyn List attracted votes based on an appeal similar to that of the Centre Democrats.

==Ideology==
After the split from the Centre Party, the ideology of the Centre Democrats was broadly similar to that of its originator, although the Centre Party became increasingly radical in the following years. The Centre Democrats did not publish a party or electoral manifesto before 1989, and until then its policies were known primarily through the small-scale distribution of pamphlets, which were almost exact copies of old Centre Party pamphlets. Like the Centre Party, the Centre Democrats claimed to be at the centre of the political spectrum, representing a &quot;centre-democratic ideology&quot;. Nevertheless, the party focused mainly on the issue of immigration, and mainstream observers considered the party&#x27;s ideology to be a populist form of nationalism.

===Immigration and multiculturalism===
The Centre Democrats was strongly opposed to multiculturalism and immigration. It did not, however, exclude people based on ethnicity. It spoke, initially at least, of a Dutch population rather than a Dutch ethnic community. The party remained distinct from ethnic nationalists, as it gave immigrants the choice between repatriation or assimilation. Its 1989 party program stated that &quot;foreigners and minorities either adjust to the Dutch ways and customs or leave the country.&quot; The Centre Democrats considered Dutch culture to be under threat from foreigners, and that Muslims in particular had come to the Netherlands with the intention of taking over or dominating the country. Also opposed to &quot;multicultural marriages,&quot; and wanting to limit the possibility of adoptions from the Third World, the CP generally sought a return to the old Dutch society with its singular Dutch culture. According to political scientist Cas Mudde, the party&#x27;s ideology is best described as civic nationalism. Nevertheless, by 1994 the party had moved more towards ethnic nationalism by asserting that its program began &quot;from the indissoluble unity and solidarity of the Dutch ethnic community [...] based on the common history and the culture that originated from that history.&quot;

===Foreign policy===
The Centre Democrats opposed any limitation of the sovereignty of the Dutch state and was thus skeptical of the European Union and European integration, seeing the Maastricht Treaty as one of many international defeats inflicted on the Dutch government. While it generally described international organizations such as the United Nations as superfluous and inefficient bureaucracies, it supported NATO as a means of keeping the West safe from Communism. In its 1998 program, the Centre Democrats included a call for the &quot;reunification with Flanders and other Dutch-speaking territories&quot;, thereby promoting the idea of a Greater Netherlands.

===Society===
While the party did not originally place heavy emphasis on ethical issues, it did see the family as the cornerstone of society. By 1994, it had become more conservative, stressing law and order as well as traditional morals and values. Over the years, it also sought to make divorce more difficult, particularly for families with children. The party also lent much space to discussing the AIDS virus, which it put in the context of a moral crisis and moral relativism that it considered to only be solvable by returning to traditional morality.

===Economic===
The party&#x27;s economic policies did not deviate substantially from the generally supported mixed economy of the Netherlands. Its other demands did not have a strong ideological coherency. Supporting a generous welfare state for the Dutch people, it was otherwise sceptical of state interventionism in the economy; notably by high taxes which would hinder private initiative, or overspending on subsidies.

==Organisation==

The original scientific bureau, or think tank, of the Centre Democrats was the Foundation for the Scientific Elaboration of the Centre Democratic Ideology (, SWOCI). In 1992 its name was changed to the Thomas Hobbes Foundation (), after Janmaat&#x27;s favorite political philosopher Thomas Hobbes.

The Young Centre Democrats (), became the youth organization of the Centre Democrats, having originally been founded as the youth wing of the Centre Party in the early 1980s. It was later succeeded by the CD Youth (), which was based almost exclusively in the Haarlem area. The Centre Democrats did not attract many youngsters, nor did it establish a particularly active youth organization. Most of the far-right youth tended to join CP&#x27;86.

Over time the Centre Democrats published a variety of party papers of varying quality. The &quot;Centrumtaal&quot; and the &quot;Middenkoers&quot; were the original newspapers first published in 1986. Although the former was intended for general party news, and the latter aimed at a more intellectual readership, they did not differ much in content. By 1987–1988, &quot;Centrumtaal&quot; was more or less succeeded by &quot;CD-info&quot;, and &quot;Middenkoers&quot; by &quot;CD-actueel&quot;. &quot;CD-actueel&quot; was distributed for the last time in 1993, with &quot;CD-info&quot; succeeded by the &quot;CD-Nieuwsbrief&quot; in 1997, although in later years it had been published less and less frequently.

==International relations==
The CD regarded itself as related to other European &quot;patriotic parties&quot;, but its official contact was limited to the German People&#x27;s Union, the French National Front and the Belgian Vlaams Blok. The party regularly attended annual meetings of the German People&#x27;s Union and the National Front, and Janmaat spoke of his good contacts with the latter party&#x27;s leader Jean-Marie Le Pen. Relations with the Vlaams Blok created a conflict of interest given VB&#x27;s arguably better contacts with CP&#x27;86, the Centre Democrats&#x27; main rival in the Netherlands. Even so, the Centre Democrats maintained official contacts domestically with both the Centre Party and its successor, the CP&#x27;86.

<text>In mathematics, particularly homological algebra, an exact functor is a functor that preserves short exact sequences. Exact functors are convenient for algebraic calculations because they can be directly applied to presentations of objects. Much of the work in homological algebra is designed to cope with functors that &quot;fail&quot; to be exact, but in ways that can still be controlled.

== Definitions ==
Let P and Q be abelian categories, and let be a covariant additive functor (so that, in particular, &quot;F&quot;(0) = 0). We say that &quot;F&quot; is an exact functor if whenever 

:formula_1 

is a short exact sequence in P then 

:formula_2 

is a short exact sequence in Q. (The maps are often omitted and implied, and one says: &quot;if 0→&quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;→&quot;C&quot;→0 is exact, then 0→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;B&quot;)→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;C&quot;)→0 is also exact&quot;.) 

Further, we say that &quot;F&quot; is 

*left-exact if whenever 0→&quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;→&quot;C&quot;→0 is exact then 0→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;B&quot;)→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) is exact;
*right-exact if whenever 0→&quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;→&quot;C&quot;→0 is exact then &quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;B&quot;)→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;C&quot;)→0 is exact;
*half-exact if whenever 0→&quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;→&quot;C&quot;→0 is exact then &quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;B&quot;)→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) is exact. This is distinct from the notion of a topological half-exact functor.

If &quot;G&quot; is a contravariant additive functor from P to Q, we similarly define &quot;G&quot; to be

*exact if whenever 0→&quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;→&quot;C&quot;→0 is exact then 0→&quot;G&quot;(&quot;C&quot;)→&quot;G&quot;(&quot;B&quot;)→&quot;G&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)→0 is exact;
*left-exact if whenever 0→&quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;→&quot;C&quot;→0 is exact then 0→&quot;G&quot;(&quot;C&quot;)→&quot;G&quot;(&quot;B&quot;)→&quot;G&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is exact;
*right-exact if whenever 0→&quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;→&quot;C&quot;→0 is exact then &quot;G&quot;(&quot;C&quot;)→&quot;G&quot;(&quot;B&quot;)→&quot;G&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)→0 is exact;
*half-exact if whenever 0→&quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;→&quot;C&quot;→0 is exact then &quot;G&quot;(&quot;C&quot;)→&quot;G&quot;(&quot;B&quot;)→&quot;G&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is exact.

It is not always necessary to start with an entire short exact sequence 0→&quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;→&quot;C&quot;→0 to have some exactness preserved. The following definitions are equivalent to the ones given above:

*&quot;F&quot; is exact if and only if &quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;→&quot;C&quot; exact implies &quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;B&quot;)→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) exact;
*&quot;F&quot; is left-exact if and only if 0→&quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;→&quot;C&quot; exact implies 0→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;B&quot;)→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) exact (i.e. if &quot;&quot;F&quot; turns kernels into kernels&quot;);
*&quot;F&quot; is right-exact if and only if &quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;→&quot;C&quot;→0 exact implies &quot;F&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;B&quot;)→&quot;F&quot;(&quot;C&quot;)→0 exact (i.e. if &quot;&quot;F&quot; turns cokernels into cokernels&quot;);
*&quot;G&quot; is left-exact if and only if &quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;→&quot;C&quot;→0 exact implies 0→&quot;G&quot;(&quot;C&quot;)→&quot;G&quot;(&quot;B&quot;)→&quot;G&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) exact (i.e. if &quot;&quot;G&quot; turns cokernels into kernels&quot;);
*&quot;G&quot; is right-exact if and only if 0→&quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;→&quot;C&quot; exact implies &quot;G&quot;(&quot;C&quot;)→&quot;G&quot;(&quot;B&quot;)→&quot;G&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)→0 exact (i.e. if &quot;&quot;G&quot; turns kernels into cokernels&quot;).

== Examples ==

Every equivalence or duality of abelian categories is exact.

The most basic examples of left exact functors are the Hom functors: if A is an abelian category and &quot;A&quot; is an object of A, then &quot;F&quot;&quot;A&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = HomA(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;X&quot;) defines a covariant left-exact functor from A to the category Ab of abelian groups. The functor &quot;F&quot;&quot;A&quot; is exact if and only if &quot;A&quot; is projective. The functor &quot;G&quot;&quot;A&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = HomA(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;A&quot;) is a contravariant left-exact functor; it is exact if and only if &quot;A&quot; is injective.

If &quot;k&quot; is a field and &quot;V&quot; is a vector space over &quot;k&quot;, we write &quot;V&quot; * = Hom&quot;k&quot;(&quot;V&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) (this is commonly known as the dual space). This yields a contravariant exact functor from the category of &quot;k&quot;-vector spaces to itself. (Exactness follows from the above: &quot;k&quot; is an injective &quot;k&quot;-module. Alternatively, one can argue that every short exact sequence of &quot;k&quot;-vector spaces splits, and any additive functor turns split sequences into split sequences.)

If &quot;X&quot; is a topological space, we can consider the abelian category of all sheaves of abelian groups on &quot;X&quot;. The covariant functor that associates to each sheaf &quot;F&quot; the group of global sections &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is left-exact.

If &quot;R&quot; is a ring and &quot;T&quot; is a right &quot;R&quot;-module, we can define a functor &quot;H&quot;&quot;T&quot; from the abelian category of all left &quot;R&quot;-modules to Ab by using the tensor product over &quot;R&quot;: &quot;H&quot;&quot;T&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;T&quot; ⊗ &quot;X&quot;. This is a covariant right exact functor; in other words, given an exact sequence &quot;A&quot;→&quot;B&quot;→&quot;C&quot;→0 of left &quot;R&quot; modules, the sequence of abelian groups &quot;T&quot; ⊗ &quot;A&quot; → &quot;T&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot; → &quot;T&quot; ⊗ &quot;C&quot; → 0 is exact. 

The functor &quot;H&quot;&quot;T&quot; is exact if and only if &quot;T&quot; is flat. For example, formula_3 is a flat formula_4-module. Therefore, tensoring with formula_3 as a formula_4-module is an exact functor. Proof: It suffices to show that if &quot;i&quot; is an injective map of formula_4-modules formula_8, then the corresponding map between the tensor products formula_9 is injective. One can show that formula_10 if and only if formula_11 is a torsion element or formula_12. The given tensor products only have pure tensors. Therefore, it suffices to show that if a pure tensor formula_13 is in the kernel, then it is zero. Suppose that formula_13 is an element of the kernel. Then, formula_15 is torsion. Since formula_16 is injective, formula_11 is torsion. Therefore, formula_18. Therefore, formula_19 is also injective.

In general, if &quot;T&quot; is not flat, then tensor product is not left exact. For example, consider the short exact sequence of formula_20-modules formula_21. Tensoring over formula_20 with formula_23 gives a sequence that is no longer exact, since formula_23 is not torsion-free and thus not flat. 

If A is an abelian category and C is an arbitrary small category, we can consider the functor category AC consisting of all functors from C to A; it is abelian. If &quot;X&quot; is a given object of C, then we get a functor &quot;E&quot;&quot;X&quot; from AC to A by evaluating functors at &quot;X&quot;. This functor &quot;E&quot;&quot;X&quot; is exact.

While tensoring may not be left exact, it can be shown that tensoring is a right exact functor: 

Theorem: Let &quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot; and &quot;P&quot; be &quot;R&quot;-modules for a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; having multiplicative identity. Let formula_25 be a short exact sequence of &quot;R&quot;-modules. Then 
:formula_26
is also a short exact sequence of &quot;R&quot;-modules. (Since &quot;R&quot; is commutative, this sequence is a sequence of &quot;R&quot;-modules and not merely of abelian groups). Here, we define
:formula_27. 

This has a useful corollary: If &quot;I&quot; is an ideal of &quot;R&quot; and &quot;P&quot; is as above, then formula_28.

Proof: formula_29, where &quot;f&quot; is the inclusion and &quot;g&quot; is the projection, is an exact sequence of &quot;R&quot;-modules. By the above we get that :formula_30 is also a short exact sequence of &quot;R&quot;-modules. By exactness, formula_31, since &quot;f&quot; is the inclusion. Now, consider the &quot;R&quot;-module homomorphism from formula_32 given by &quot;R&quot;-linearly extending the map defined on pure tensors: formula_33 implies that formula_34. So, the kernel of this map cannot contain any nonzero pure tensors. formula_35 is composed only of pure tensors: For formula_36. So, this map is injective. It is clearly onto. So, formula_37. Similarly, formula_38. This proves the corollary.

As another application, we show that for, formula_39 where formula_40 and &quot;n&quot; is the highest power of 2 dividing &quot;m&quot;. We prove a special case: &quot;m&quot;=12.

Proof: Consider a pure tensor formula_41. Also, for formula_42.
This shows that formula_43. Letting formula_44, &quot;A,B,C,P&quot; are &quot;R&quot;=Z modules by the usual multiplication action and satisfy the conditions of the main theorem. By the exactness implied by the theorem and by the above note we obtain that
formula_45. The last congruence follows by a similar argument to one in the proof of the corollary showing that formula_46.

== Properties and theorems ==

A functor is exact if and only if it is both left exact and right exact.

A covariant (not necessarily additive) functor is left exact if and only if it turns finite limits into limits; a covariant functor is right exact if and only if it turns finite colimits into colimits; a contravariant functor is left exact iff it turns finite colimits into limits; a contravariant functor is right exact iff it turns finite limits into colimits. 

The degree to which a left exact functor fails to be exact can be measured with its right derived functors; the degree to which a right exact functor fails to be exact can be measured with its left derived functors.

Left and right exact functors are ubiquitous mainly because of the following fact: if the functor &quot;F&quot; is left adjoint to &quot;G&quot;, then &quot;F&quot; is right exact and &quot;G&quot; is left exact.

== Generalizations ==

In SGA4, tome I, section 1, the notion of left (right) exact functors are defined for general categories, and not just abelian ones. The definition is as follows: 
:Let &quot;C&quot; be a category with finite projective (resp. injective) limits. Then a functor from &quot;C&quot; to another category &quot;C′&quot; is left (resp. right) exact if it commutes with finite projective (resp. inductive) limits.
Despite its abstraction, this general definition has useful consequences. For example, in section 1.8, Grothendieck proves that a functor is pro-representable if and only if it is left exact, under some mild conditions on the category &quot;C&quot;.

The exact functors between Quillen&#x27;s exact categories generalize the exact functors between abelian categories discussed here.

The regular functors between regular categories are sometimes called exact functors and generalize the exact functors discussed here.

<text>The University of Siena (, abbreviation: UNISI), located in Siena, Tuscany, holds the distinction of being Italy&#x27;s first publicly funded university as well as one of the oldest, originally established as &quot;Studium Senese&quot; in 1240. As of 2022, it hosts approximately 16,000 students—nearly one-third of Siena&#x27;s total population of about 53,000. The university is renowned for its schools of law, medicine, and economics and management.

==History==
===The early &quot;studium&quot;===

==== The School of Humanities and Philosophy ====
On December 26, 1240, Ildebrandino Cacciaconti, the then podestà of Siena, signed a decree imposing a tax on citizens of Siena who rented rooms to students of the local &quot;Studium Senese&quot;. The money from this tax went towards paying for the salaries of the &quot;maestri&quot; (teachers) of this new studium. The studium was further supported when, in 1252, Pope Innocent IV declared both its teachers and students completely immune from taxes and forced labour levied on their person or property by the city of Siena. Moreover, the commune exempted teachers of law and Latin from military service and teachers of Latin were also excused from their duties as night watchmen. By the early 14th century, there were five teachers of Latin, logic and law and two doctors of natural sciences (medicine).

One of the most notable maestri of the School of Medicine was Pietro Ispano (Pope John XXI). Ispano was a philosopher, a personal doctor to Emperor Frederick II, and in 1276 became Pope John XXI.

In 1321, the studium was able to attract a larger number of pupils due to a mass exodus from the prestigious University of Bologna when one of its students was sentenced to death by Bologna&#x27;s magistrates for supposedly kidnapping a young woman. Partly at the instigation of their law lecturer Guglielmo Tolomei, the student body there unleashed a great protest at the Bolognese authority and Siena, supported by funding from the local commune, was able to accommodate the students resigning from the &quot;Studium Bolognese&quot;.

===The university under changing states===
The studium of Siena was eventually promoted to the status of &quot;&quot;Studium Generale&quot; by Charles IV, shortly after his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor in 1355. This both placed the teachers and students under the safeguard of the imperial authority (protecting them from the local magistracy) and also meant that the licences (&quot;licentiae docendi&quot;) granted by the university were &quot;ubique docendi&quot;.&quot;

These licences entitled the person receiving them to teach throughout Christendom.

The &quot;Casa della Sapienza&quot; was built in the early 15th century as a center that combines classrooms and housing for those enrolled in the Studium. It had been proposed by bishop Francesco Mormile in 1392, was completed twenty years later, and its first occupants took up residence in 1416. Room and board in 1416 cost fifty gold florins for a semester.

By the mid-14th century, Siena had declined as a power in Tuscany, eclipsed by the rise in power of Florence, who defeated the Republic of Siena in 1555. The city authorities, however, successfully asked the Medici (the hereditary dukes of Florence at the time) to preserve the academy. Francesco and later Grand Duke Ferdinando I, reforms were made with new statutes and new prerogatives. The post of &quot;Rettore&quot; (Rector), elected by students and city magistrates, was also instituted.

In 1737, the Medici line became extinct and the rule of Tuscany passed to the French House of Lorraine. In this period, the Tuscan economist Sallustio Bandini, seemingly determined to &quot;improve the intellectual stimulation of his native Siena&quot; solicited scholarships from rich patrons for the university and also set up a large library, which he eventually bequeathed to the university.

In 1808, when the Napoleonic forces occupied Tuscany, they eliminated the &quot;Studium Senese&quot; and the doors of the University were not opened again until after the defeat of Napoleon and the restoration of Ferdinand III as the Grand Duke of Tuscany.

===The university in the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;===
During the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;, the movement towards the unification of Italy as a single state, Sienese students organised groups which were openly patriotic. They publicly expressed their dissent and, during the April 1848 revolts in Tuscany, three professors, one assistant and fifty-five students formed the &quot;Compagnia della Guardia Universitaria&quot; to participate in the battles of Curtatone and of Montanara. The troop&#x27;s flag is still preserved in the Chancellor&#x27;s building. All of this passion for the new republic could not but trouble the Grand Duke and in the end he closed down the School of Medicine permitting only Law and Theology to continue

After the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859 and its aftermath, Tuscany and with it Siena were controlled by the Kingdom of Sardinia, which was to become the Kingdom of Italy, now the Italian Republic. The Sienese academy eventually recovered from the unrest, thanks to initiatives by the city&#x27;s private enterprises and a series of legislative acknowledgements that boosted the reputation of the School of Pharmacy and that of Obstetrics (and consequently the School of Medicine itself) while the old hospital Santa Maria della Scala was transformed into General University Hospital. Some time later in 1880, the Law Faculty established the &quot;Circolo Giuridico&quot; or Legal Circle, where issues pertaining to law studies were examined in depth through seminars and lectures

===The university in modern Italy===
In 1892, the Minister of Public Education, Ferdinando Martini, launched a proposal aimed at suppressing the Sienese academy’s activities. Siena perceived this as a declaration of war and was backed immediately by a general tradesmen’s strike, the intervention of all of the town’s institutions and by a genuine uprising of the population – all of which induced the minister to withdraw the project. Having escaped this danger, the town went back to investing its resources in the university setting up new degrees and new faculties. The bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena financed the construction of the biology department.

The 20th century witnessed the growth of the University of Siena, with the student population escalating from four hundred between the wars to more than 15,000 in the last few years.

==Organization==
Since 2012, after the general reform of Italian Universities (&quot;Gelmini Act&quot;), the University is composed of fourteen departments, grouped in four areas:
* Biomedical and Medical Sciences
** Department of Medical Biotechnologies
** Department of Molecular and Developmental Medicine
** Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience
* Economics, Law and Political Sciences
** Department of Economics and Statistics
** Department of Law
** Department of Political and International Sciences
** Department of Business and Law
* Experimental Sciences
** Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy
** Department of Information Engineering and Mathematics
** Department of Life Sciences
** Department of Physical Sciences, Earth and Environment
* Literature, History, Philosophy and the Arts
** Department of Philology and Literary Criticism
** Department of Social, Political and Cognitive Sciences
** Department of History and Cultural Heritage
Each department offers graduate and undergraduate courses.

Since 2014 the Department of Economics and Statistics and the Department of Business and Law merged their undergraduate and graduate courses into the School of Economics and Management (SEM).

Formerly, the University was composed of nine schools:

* The School of Economics
* The School of Engineering
* The School of Humanities and Philosophy
* The School of Humanities and Philosophy – Arezzo
* The School of Jurisprudence
* The School of Mathematical, Physical and Natural Sciences
* The School of Medicine and Surgery
* The School of Pharmacy
* The School of Political Science

Siena&#x27;s campus is the city. 15,600 students live among the 53,000 Sienese. The university prides itself on diversity.

Recently, the university has returned historical buildings to the city, which are being made into apartments or used by the contradas. The university is responsible for many buildings at risk being saved, turned into institutions of study. The faculties of Engineering and Literature, for example, have found space for their departments in the large rooms of what was once the San Niccolò Psychiatric Hospital. Another example is the transformation of the former Convent of Santa Chiara into the first collegiate residence in Italy, reserved for those working towards a European postgraduate degree. The church of San Vigilio serves as university chapel.

New university buildings have also been built in the city centre such as the one that houses the Faculty of Political Science and Law. The ten university dormitories are located within the historical centre (Fontebranda, Mattioli, Porrione, Sperandie, San Marco), on the outskirts (Acquacalda) and near the extended areas of the university (San Miniato).

<doc id="453953" wikidata="Q3459135" url="?curid=453953" title="SABC 1">
<text>SABC 1 is a South African public television network operated by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). It broadcasts programming in English and Nguni languages.

SABC 1 was established in 1996 following the SABC&#x27;s restructuring of its television channels. Much of its programming was carried over from the TV1 network, which had itself been formed from the timeshared channels TV2, TV3, and TV4 in the 1980s. SABC 1 attracts the largest audience in South Africa due to its diverse programming, including SABC&#x27;s longest-running soap opera, &quot;&quot;, as well as &quot;Uzalo&quot; and &quot;Skeem Saam.&quot;

As of June 2018, the channel began broadcasting in high definition.

==History==
===Initial TV Bantu plan===
When the SABC was granted approval to launch a television service in 1971, it was initially planned to have two channels: TV One, broadcasting in English and Afrikaans for white audiences, and TV Bantu, broadcasting in Bantu languages for black audiences. However, when television was eventually introduced in South Africa, the SABC launched only one channel—SABC TV—which aligned with the planned TV One service.

===As the combined TV2/TV3 network and TV4===
In 1980, the SABC announced plans to introduce a network for Black South Africans by 1982. The service was intended to broadcast for three hours on weekdays, with extended hours on weekends. Similar to SABC TV, it would be funded through a combination of advertising revenue and government grants.

On 31 December 1981, two new services were launched: TV2, which broadcast in Zulu and Xhosa, and TV3, which broadcast in Sotho and Tswana. Both channels were aimed at an urban Black audience and operated on a timeshared radio frequency. The main network, now called TV1, continued to divide its programming equally between English and Afrikaans, as it had before. Both TV2 and TV3 also included selected programmes in English, as the language remained a lingua franca for urban Black audiences and was the preferred language for many print media outlets targeting this demographic.

In 1985, a new service called TV4 was introduced, offering sports and entertainment programming. It utilised the same frequency as TV2 and TV3, which ceased broadcasting at 9:30 pm each evening.

===As CCV===
In 1992, TV2, TV3, and TV4 were merged into a single unified network called CCV (Contemporary Community Values), operating on the same frequency as TV2. A third network, known as TSS (TopSport Surplus), was also introduced, with TopSport serving as the SABC&#x27;s brand for sports coverage. TSS used the same frequency as TV3. However, in 1994, TSS was replaced by NNTV (National Network TV), a cultural, non-commercial network. The channel adopted &quot;Join Our World&quot; as its slogan.

===As SABC 1===
In 1996, the SABC reorganised its three television networks to better reflect South Africa&#x27;s diverse ethnolinguistic groups. The networks were rebranded as SABC 3 (originally TV1), SABC 1 (originally TV2 then CCV-TV), and SABC 1 (originally TV3). SABC 1 took over the former CCV network, offering programming in English alongside several national languages. At the time of the rebranding, prime-time programming (18:00 to 21:30) comprised 29% English, 18% Zulu, 18% Xhosa, 1% Siswati, and 1% isiNdebele, with the remaining third dedicated to &quot;multilingual programming&quot; in two or more languages.

The relaunched SABC 1 marked the first time Siswati and isiNdebele were featured on national television.

The relaunch happened on all three networks on 4 February followed by a full-time change on 5 February.

On 1 December 1997, SABC 1 introduced a new channel identity used since its 1996 relaunch, while continuing to use Simunye as its slogan.

The channel introduced a new identity at 5pm on 18 August 2003, presenting itself as &quot;Ya Mampela&quot; (The Real Thing), aiming to solidify its position among an increasingly urban viewing audience. A controversial race reversal advertisement (&quot;PF Jones&quot;) appeared to tie in with the relaunch, over time, false information had emerged online that the advert was banned. The slogan was seen with criticism from Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini, who in February 2005 wanted the channel to ditch the phrase citing &quot;improper use&quot; of the Zulu language. The controversial &quot;PF Jones&quot; advert, with the channel&#x27;s slogan appearing at the end, was dropped in the wake of the language controversy.

== Programming ==
SABC 1 is heavily focused on local entertainment targeted at the youth.

=== Soapies, dramas and telenovelas ===
The channel has been known as &#x27;Mzansi&#x27;s Storyteller&#x27; due to its popular local dramas, including the well-known soap operas &quot;&quot;, &quot;Uzalo&quot;, and &quot;Skeem Saam&quot;. Other notable dramas from past years include &quot;Yizo Yizo&quot;, &quot;Zone 14&quot;, &quot;Mfolozi Street&quot;, &quot;Intersexions&quot;, and &quot;The Shakespeare in Mzansi Series,&quot; among others. However, in recent years, this title has been adopted by Mzansi Magic.

=== Series ===
The channel features a variety of comedy shows, game shows, and reality series, including &quot;Nyan&#x27;Nyan&quot;, &quot;Now or Never&quot;, &quot;It Takes a Village&quot;, &quot;Plate it up&quot;, &quot;The next big thing&quot;, &quot;Ses&#x27; Top La&quot;, F&quot;riends Like These&quot;, &quot;The Remix&quot;, &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot;, and &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;. Initially, the channel had the rights to broadcast local versions of international franchises like &quot;The X Factor&quot;, but due to financial constraints, it now focuses primarily on local reality competitions.

=== Music ===
The channel airs some of the latest local urban music and playlists on shows like &quot;Live Amp&quot; and &quot;Koze Kuse&quot;, while also focusing on traditional indigenous music on shows like &quot;Roots&quot; and choral music on one of its longest-running shows, &quot;Imizwilili&quot;.

=== Talk and magazine ===
SABC 1 airs local informative magazine shows, ranging from its longest-running magazine show, &quot;Selimathunzi&quot;, to more recent and fresh shows like &quot;Throwback Thursday&quot; and weekend breakfast shows like &quot;Mzansi Insider&quot;, among others. Additionally, SABC 1 hosts interactive talk shows such as &quot;Daily Thetha&quot; and &quot;The Chatroom&quot;.

=== Religion ===
On a daily basis, the channel showcases short religious shows catering to African Traditional Religion, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. On weekends, it features religious music shows such as &quot;Gospel Avenue&quot; and &quot;Imvelo&quot;.

=== News and current affairs ===
The channel has two bulletins: one for SiSwati/isiNdebele speakers and another for IsiZulu/IsiXhosa speakers. In addition, it includes current affairs programmes such as &quot;Cutting Edge&quot;, &quot;Expressions&quot;, and &quot;Yilungelo Lakho&quot;.

=== Sports ===
SABC1 airs Premier Soccer League (PSL) matches during the weekend and also holds broadcasting rights for other football events such as the Africa Cup of Nations, the FIFA World Cup, and Bafana Bafana And Banyana Banyana international friendlies.

However, in August 2019, the channel could not afford the broadcast rights to the PSL season, resulting in a blackout of sports on both TV and radio platforms and the suspension of match broadcasts for a period. This angered soccer fans who did not have access to SuperSport on DStv, as MultiChoice held the sports rights. Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa and Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams announced that, following a meeting with the public broadcaster&#x27;s board and MultiChoice, a resolution had been reached, and soccer matches resumed as normal.

=== Movies ===
The network airs classic action, horror, drama, comedy, sci-fi, adventure, thriller, romance, and fantasy movies on certain weekends. SABC 1 also broadcasts &quot;Kicking Kung Fu&quot; movies on Fridays.

===Children and education===

SABC 1 features some foreign children&#x27;s programming, mostly from Disney Junior. In addition, it airs the longest-running local kids&#x27; show, &quot;YoTV&quot;, which broadcasts five times a week and once every weekend. The channel also offers shows under its SABC Education banner that cater to all ages, such as the high school revision show &quot;Geleza Nathi&quot; and career-focused shows like &quot;Ispani&quot; and &quot;Teenagers on A Mission&quot;.

<doc id="453959" wikidata="Q272085" url="?curid=453959" title="HD 209458 b">
<text>HD 209458 b is an exoplanet that orbits the solar analog HD 209458 in the constellation Pegasus, some from the Solar System. The radius of the planet&#x27;s orbit is , or one-eighth the radius of Mercury&#x27;s orbit (). This small radius results in a year that is 3.5 Earth-days long and an estimated surface temperature of about . Its mass is 220 times that of Earth (0.69 Jupiter masses) and its volume is some 2.5 times greater than that of Jupiter. The high mass and volume of HD 209458 b indicate that it is a gas giant.

HD 209458 b represents a number of milestones in exoplanetary research. It was the first of many categories:
* a transiting extrasolar planet
* The first planet detected through more than one method
* an extrasolar planet known to have an atmosphere
* an extrasolar planet observed to have an evaporating hydrogen atmosphere
* an extrasolar planet found to have an atmosphere containing the elements oxygen and carbon
* one of the first two extrasolar planets to be directly observed spectroscopically
* The first extrasolar gas giant to have its superstorm measured
* the first planet to have its orbital speed measured, determining its mass directly.
Based on the application of newer theoretical models, as of April 2007, it is thought to be the first extrasolar planet found to have water vapor in its atmosphere.

In July 2014, NASA announced finding very dry atmospheres on HD 209458 b and two other exoplanets (HD 189733 b and WASP-12b) orbiting Sun-like stars.

HD 209458 b has been nicknamed &quot;Osiris&quot; after the Egyptian god. This nickname has been acknowledged by the IAU, but it has not yet been approved as an official proper name.

== Detection and discovery ==

=== Transits ===
Spectroscopic studies first revealed the presence of a planet around HD 209458 on November 5, 1999. Astronomers had made careful photometric measurements of several stars known to be orbited by planets, in the hope that they might observe a dip in brightness caused by the transit of the planet across the star&#x27;s face. This would require the planet&#x27;s orbit to be inclined such that it would pass between the Earth and the star, and previously no transits had been detected.

Soon after the discovery, separate teams, one led by David Charbonneau including Timothy Brown and others, and the other by Gregory W. Henry, were able to detect a transit of the planet across the surface of the star making it the first known transiting extrasolar planet. On September 9 and 16, 1999, Charbonneau&#x27;s team measured a 1.7% drop in HD 209458&#x27;s brightness, which was attributed to the passage of the planet across the star. On November 8, Henry&#x27;s team observed a partial transit, seeing only the ingress. Initially unsure of their results, the Henry group decided to rush their results to publication after overhearing rumors that Charbonneau had successfully seen an entire transit in September. Papers from both teams were published simultaneously in the same issue of the Astrophysical Journal. Each transit lasts about three hours, during which the planet covers about 1.5% of the star&#x27;s face.

The star had been observed many times by the Hipparcos satellite, which allowed astronomers to calculate the orbital period of HD 209458 b very accurately at 3.524736 days.

=== Spectroscopic ===
Spectroscopic analysis had shown that the planet had a mass about 0.69 times that of Jupiter. The occurrence of transits allowed astronomers to calculate the planet&#x27;s radius, which had not been possible for any previously known exoplanet, and it turned out to have a radius some 35% larger than Jupiter&#x27;s. It had been previously hypothesized that hot Jupiters particularly close to their parent star should exhibit this kind of inflation due to intense heating of their outer atmosphere. Tidal heating due to its orbit&#x27;s eccentricity, which may have been more eccentric at formation, may also have played a role over the past billion years.

=== Direct detection ===
On March 22, 2005, NASA released news that infrared light from the planet had been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope, the first ever direct detection of light from an extrasolar planet. This was done by subtracting the parent star&#x27;s constant light and noting the difference as the planet transited in front of the star and was eclipsed behind it, providing a measure of the light from the planet itself. New measurements from this observation determined the planet&#x27;s temperature as at least . The nearly circular orbit of HD 209458 b was also confirmed.
=== Spectral observation ===
On February 21, 2007, NASA and &quot;Nature&quot; released news that HD 209458 b was one of the first two extrasolar planets to have their spectra directly observed, the other one being HD 189733 b. This was long seen as the first mechanism by which extrasolar but non-sentient life forms could be searched for, by way of influence on a planet&#x27;s atmosphere. A group of investigators led by Jeremy Richardson of NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center spectrally measured HD 209458 b&#x27;s atmosphere in the range of 7.5 to 13.2 micrometres. The results defied theoretical expectations in several ways. The spectrum had been predicted to have a peak at 10 micrometres, which would have indicated water vapor in the atmosphere, but such a peak was absent, indicating no detectable water vapor. Another unpredicted peak was observed at 9.65 micrometres, which the investigators attributed to clouds of silicate dust, a phenomenon not previously observed. Another unpredicted peak occurred at 7.78 micrometres, for which the investigators did not have an explanation. A separate team led by Mark Swain of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory reanalyzed the Richardson &quot;et al.&quot; data, and had not yet published their results when the Richardson &quot;et al.&quot; article came out, but made similar findings.

On 23 June 2010, astronomers announced they have measured a superstorm (with windspeeds of up to ) for the first time in the atmosphere of HD 209458 b. The very high-precision observations done by ESO&#x27;s Very Large Telescope and its powerful CRIRES spectrograph of carbon monoxide gas show that it is streaming at enormous speed from the extremely hot day side to the cooler night side of the planet. The observations also allow another exciting &quot;first&quot;—measuring the orbital speed of the exoplanet itself, providing a direct determination of its mass.

As of 2021, the spectra of planetary atmosphere taken by different instruments remains highly inconsistent, indicating either metal-poor atmosphere, temperatures below blackbody equilibrium or disequilibrium atmosphere chemistry.

== Rotation ==
In August 2008, the measurement of HD 209458 b&#x27;s Rossiter–McLaughlin effect and hence spin–orbit angle is −4.4 ± 1.4°.

The study in 2012, updated the spin-orbit angle to −5°.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Stratosphere and upper clouds ===
The atmosphere is at a pressure of one bar at an altitude of 1.29 Jupiter radii above the planet&#x27;s center.

Where the pressure is 33±5 millibars, the atmosphere is clear (probably hydrogen) and its Rayleigh effect is detectable. At that pressure, the temperature is .

Observations by the orbiting Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope initially limited the planet&#x27;s albedo (or reflectivity) below 0.3, making it a surprisingly dark object. (The geometric albedo has since been measured to be 0.038 ± 0.045.) In comparison, Jupiter has a much higher albedo of 0.52. This would suggest that HD 209458 b&#x27;s upper cloud deck is either made of less reflective material than is Jupiter&#x27;s, or else has no clouds and Rayleigh-scatters incoming radiation like Earth&#x27;s dark ocean. Models since then have shown that between the top of its atmosphere and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, there exists a stratosphere of cooler gas. This implies an outer shell of dark, opaque, hot clouds; usually thought to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides, but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet. A 2016 study indicates the high-altitude cloud cover is patchy with about 57 percent coverage. The Rayleigh-scattering heated hydrogen rests at the top of the stratosphere; the absorptive portion of the cloud deck floats above it at 25 millibars.

=== Exosphere ===
On November 27, 2001, astronomers announced that they had detected sodium in the atmosphere of the planet, using observations with the Hubble Space Telescope. This was the first planetary atmosphere outside the Solar System to be measured. The core of the sodium line runs from pressures of 50 millibar to a microbar. This turns out to be about a third the amount of sodium at HD 189733 b.

The additional data did not confirm the presence of sodium in the atmosphere of HD 209458 b as in 2020.

In 2003–4, astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph to discover an enormous ellipsoidal envelope of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen around the planet that reaches . The hydrogen exosphere extends to a distance &quot;R&quot;H=3.1 &quot;R&quot;J, much larger than the planetary radius of 1.32 RJ. At this temperature and distance, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of particle velocities gives rise to a significant &quot;tail&quot; of atoms moving at speeds greater than the escape velocity. The planet is estimated to be losing about of hydrogen per second. Analysis of the starlight passing through the envelope shows that the heavier carbon and oxygen atoms are being blown from the planet by the extreme &quot;hydrodynamic drag&quot; created by its evaporating hydrogen atmosphere. The hydrogen tail streaming from the planet is approximately long, which is roughly equivalent to its diameter.

It is thought that this type of atmosphere loss may be common to all planets orbiting Sun-like stars closer than around . HD 209458 b will not evaporate entirely, although it may have lost up to about 7% of its mass over its estimated lifetime of 5 billion years. It may be possible that the planet&#x27;s magnetic field may prevent this loss, because the exosphere would become ionized by the star, and the magnetic field would contain the ions from loss.

=== Atmosphere composition ===
On April 10, 2007, Travis Barman of the Lowell Observatory announced evidence that the atmosphere of HD 209458 b contained water vapor. Using a combination of previously published Hubble Space Telescope measurements and new theoretical models, Barman found strong evidence for water absorption in the planet&#x27;s atmosphere. His method modeled light passing directly through the atmosphere from the planet&#x27;s star as the planet passed in front of it. However, this hypothesis is still being investigated for confirmation.

Barman drew on data and measurements taken by Heather Knutson, a student at Harvard University, from the Hubble Space Telescope, and applied new theoretical models to demonstrate the likelihood of water absorption in the atmosphere of the planet. The planet orbits its parent star every three and a half days, and each time it passes in front of its parent star, the atmospheric contents can be analyzed by examining how the atmosphere absorbs light passing from the star directly through the atmosphere in the direction of Earth.

According to a summary of the research, atmospheric water absorption in such an exoplanet renders it larger in appearance across one part of the infrared spectrum, compared to wavelengths in the visible spectrum. Barman took Knutson&#x27;s Hubble data on HD 209458 b, applied to his theoretical model, and allegedly identified water absorption in the planet&#x27;s atmosphere.

On April 24, the astronomer David Charbonneau, who led the team that made the Hubble observations, cautioned that the telescope itself may have introduced variations that caused the theoretical model to suggest the presence of water. He hoped that further observations would clear the matter up in the following months. As of April 2007, further investigation is being conducted.

On October 20, 2009, researchers at JPL announced the discovery of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane in the atmosphere.

The refined spectra obtained in 2021 has detected instead water vapor, carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, methane, ammonia and acetylene, all consistent with the extremely high carbon to oxygen molar ratio of 1.0 (while Sun has C/O molar ratio of 0.55). If true, the HD 209458 b may be a prime example of the carbon planet.

== Magnetic field ==
In 2014, a magnetic field around HD 209458 b was inferred from the way hydrogen was evaporating from the planet. It is the first (indirect) detection of a magnetic field on an exoplanet. The magnetic field is estimated to be about one tenth as strong as Jupiter&#x27;s.

Since HD 209458 b orbits less than 0.1 AU from its host star, theorists hypothesized that it may cause stellar flaring synchronized to the orbital period of the exoplanet. A 2011 search for these magnetic star-planet interactions that would result in coronal radio emissions did not detect any signal. Similarly, no magnetospheric radio emissions were detected from the planet either.

<text>Wearable art, also known as Artwear or &quot;art to wear&quot;, refers to art pieces in the shape of clothing or jewellery pieces. These pieces are usually handmade, and are produced only once or as a very limited series. Pieces of clothing are often made with fibrous materials and traditional techniques such as crochet, knitting, quilting, but may also include plastic sheeting, metals, paper, and more. While the making of any article of clothing or other wearable object typically involves aesthetic considerations, the term &quot;wearable art&quot; implies that the work is intended to be accepted as an artistic creation or statement. Wearable art is meant to draw attention while it is being displayed, modeled or used in performances. Pieces may be sold and exhibited.

Wearable art sits at the crossroads of craft, fashion and art. The modern idea of wearable art seems to have surfaced more than once in various forms. Jewellery historians identify a wearable art movement spanning roughly the years 1930 to 1960. Textile and costume historians consider the wearable art movement to have burgeoned in the 1960s, inheriting from the 1850s Arts and Crafts.

It grew in importance in the 1970s, fueled by hippie and mod subcultures, and alongside craftivism, fiber arts and feminist art. Artists identifying with this movement are overwhelmingly women. In the late 1990s, wearable art becomes difficult to distinguish from fashion, and in the 2000s-2010s begins integrating new materials such as electronics.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The wearable art movement inherits from the Arts and Crafts movement, which sought to integrate art in everyday life and objects. Carefully handmade clothing was considered as a device for self-articulation and furthermore, a strategy to avoid the disempowerment of fashion users and designers by large-scale manufacturing.

The term wearable art emerges around 1975 to distinguish artworks made to be worn from body art and performance. It was used alongside the terms Artwear and &quot;Art to Wear&quot;. An artistic movement primarily based in the United States due to a combination of financial and educational support, it found echoes in fiber and feminist arts around the world.

=== In the United States ===
In the United States, the Wearable Art movement can be traced to the early twentieth century American Craft Revival. The American Craft Revival draws on different movements seeking to unify art and craft and empower craftspersons and artists such as Japonisme, Art Nouveau, the Vienna Secession and later the Bauhaus. During and shortly after World War Two, wealthy patrons set up educational and museum institutions, in particular the American Craft Council and the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, to support the renewal of crafts education. It enabled artists focused on crafts to support themselves and train new generations. For instance, famed Bauhaus weaver Anni Albers taught weaving at Black Mountain College from 1938, before chairing the craft department of California College of Arts and Crafts from 1960 to 1976.

Art schools were essential to the development of the Art to Wear movement. In the late sixties, a group of students at Cranbrook Academy of Art and the Pratt Institute began integrating textile techniques in their design projects. They counted among their ranks several major figures of the Art to Wear movement, including designer Jean Cacicedo. The best known galleries supporting Wearable Art were &quot;Obiko&quot; (founded in 1972 by Sandra Sakata) in San Francisco, and &quot;Julie: Artisans&#x27; Gallery&quot; (founded in 1973 by Julie Schafler-Dale) in New York.

=== Outside the United States ===
Crafts and art education being more separated outside of the United States, it is harder to identify wearable art as an independent artistic movement. However, renewed interest in traditional textile crafts such as shibori dyeing sparked the interest of artist worldwide.

== Contemporary Wearable Art ==
Wearable art declined as a distinct movement in the late 1990s due to competition from industry, which enabled customization at scale, the migration of artists towards haute couture or the production of small series, and the broader availability of handcrafted garments from around the world. Contemporary takes on wearable art may focus on integrating technologies in garments; using new manufacturing technique to expand possible silhouettes, such as Iris Van Herpen and Damselfrau; revisiting motifs from the art world in couture such as the 2015 Fall couture show Viktor and Rolf; or works used in performance arts such as Nick Cave&#x27;s Soundsuits. Moreover, works originating from fashion may question everyday wear with provocative pieces. One example is trashion, with artists creating outrageous art garments out of trash.

==Materials and Shapes==

While wearable art may use any materials or shapes that is worn, and an there are trends in the techniques and types of pieces produced due to their affordances for artists.

=== Materials ===

==== Fibers ====
Crochet, embroidery, knitting, lace, quilting and felting are all commonly found in wearable art pieces. Crochet remained a homemaker&#x27;s art until the late 1960s, as new artists began experimenting with free-handed crochet. This practice allowed artists to work in any shape and employ the use of colors freely, without the guidance of a pattern. The work of Janet Lipkin in the 1970s and 1980s is a good example of this technique. Machine knitting, because it enabled the rapid creation of complex knitted designs, was similarly popular as exemplified by the work of Susanna Lewis.

===== Electronics =====
As wearable computing technology develops, increasingly miniaturized and stylized equipment is starting to blend with wearable art esthetics. Low-power mobile computing allows light-emitting and color-changing flexible materials and high-tech fabrics to be used in complex and subtle ways. Some practitioners of the Steampunk movement have produced elaborate costumes and accessories which incorporate a pseudo-Victorian style with modern technology and materials.

=== Shapes ===

==== Kimonos and capes ====
Two recurring shapes in the Art to Wear movement were the kimono and the cape. The kimono enables to rapidly turn a piece of custom fabric into a garment. The cape is similarly easy to assemble and opens many opportunities for performance. The book Cut my cote, presenting patterns from historical folk wear, had a strong influence on the 1970s Art to Wear.

==== Jewelry ====
Some 20th-century modern artists and architects sought to elevate bodily ornamentation — that is, jewellery — to the level of fine art and original design, rather than mere decoration, craft production of traditional designs, or conventional settings for showing off expensive stones or precious metals. Jewelry was used by surrealists, cubists, abstract expressionists, and other modernist artists working in the middle decades of the 20th century.

== Relationship to Fine Arts, Fiber Arts and Performance ==
Wearable artworks can be worn or designed for performances, while artists and sculptors working with fibers or other materials may create wearable pieces. The borders of wearable art are thus fuzzy, apart from artists&#x27; self-identification to a given movement or artistic community.

For instance, &quot;Electric Dress&quot; is a ceremonial wedding kimono-like costume consisting mostly of variously colored electrified and painted light bulbs, enmeshed in a tangle of wires, created in 1956 by the Japanese Gutai artist Atsuko Tanaka. This extreme garment was something like a stage costume, designed only for performance. Similarly, in Nam June Paik&#x27;s 1969 performance piece called &quot;TV Bra for Living Sculpture&quot;, Charlotte Moorman played a cello while wearing a brassiere made of two small operating television sets.

<text>Porto Seguro (, Safe Harbor in English), is a city located in the far south of Bahia, Brazil. The city has an estimated population of 150,658 (2020), covers , and has a population density of 52.7 residents per square kilometer. The area that includes Porto Seguro and neighbouring Santa Cruz Cabrália and Eunápolis holds a distinctive place in Brazilian history: in 1500 it was the first landing point of Portuguese navigators, principally Pedro Álvares Cabral.

==Geography==
===Climate===

The climate in Porto Seguro is warm, pleasant, and partly cloudy. Over the course of the year, the temperature typically varies from 19 °C lows (67 °F) to 29C highs (84 °F) and is rarely below 18 °C (65 °F) or above 31 °C (88 °F). The temperature in Porto Seguro varies so little throughout the year that it is not entirely meaningful to discuss hot and cold seasons.

===Subdivisions===
Porto Seguro is divided into five districts
*Porto Seguro (city seat);
*Arraial d&#x27;Ajuda;
*Caraíva
*Trancoso
*Vale Verde

===Conservation===
The municipality contains the Pau-Brasil Ecological Station, a fully protected conservation unit created in 1997 to protect a fragment of Atlantic Forest, and specifically to protect Brazil wood (&quot;Pau Brasil&quot;, Caesalpinia echinata).
It contains the Rio dos Frades Wildlife Refuge, created in 2007 to protect the mouth of the Frades River.
The municipality also contains part of the Corumbau Marine Extractive Reserve, a protected offshore fishing area of .

==Economy==
The city is now considered one of the most important destinations of Brazil, receiving tourists from Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile. The city and surrounding area have some luxury hotels and hundreds of smaller hotels, as well as an airport well connected with the major Brazilian cities. Apart from tourism, other important activities are agriculture (especially cashew and coconut), reforestation with eucalyptus trees, cattle, and trade and services.

The city offers one of the most famous Carnival parties in Bahia. “Electric Trios” (trucks carrying sound systems and live bands), dancing “blocos” and “cordões” (street dancing groups) drag thousands of tourists along the &quot;Passarela do Álcool&quot; Passageway (the traditional local avenue) and to beach bars.

==Noted places==
Historical Downtown Area
The historical site in the Cidade Alta area is a National Heritage Monument put under government trust by federal decree since 1973. It was one of the first towns in Brazil and played an important role during the first years of European colonization. It includes three churches and around 40 buildings (among private residential houses and public institutions), restored by the state government for the 500th anniversary celebration of Brazilian discovery.

Monte Pascoal National Park 
Created in 1961 to preserve the place where Brazil was discovered by Portuguese warriors. It includes swamp areas, salt marshes, river marshes, and a coastline around the rocky, high, round hill, considered the first point of land to be seen by the Portuguese traveler Pedro Álvares Cabral’s crew. It extends over an area of , including the Pataxó tribe’s indigenous protection land. Besides its historical importance, it also offers protection to one of the last stretches of Atlantic forest in the Northeastern area of Brazil. The area is aimed at preserving valuable woods such as Brazil wood, and still hosts many species of animals threatened by extinction, including the collared sloth and black bear.

Recife de Fora Sea Park
It was the first city-owned park in Brazil. During low tide, visitors can view a wide range of coral reefs, fish, and many sea species.

Glória Hillock
These are ruins of what many consider to be the , where Ynaiá, an Indian woman who died for the love of a crewmember of Portuguese navigator Gonçalo Coelho&#x27;s fleet, was buried. The São Francisco Church is said to be the first one built in Brazil in baroque style, probably in 1504, whose ruins date to 1730.

The Nossa Senhora da Penha Matrix Church
Located on Pero de Campos Tourinho Square, in Cidade Alta, it was built at the end of the 18th century. It comprises a nave, a main chapel, a sacristy, and a bell tower.

Jaqueira Indigenous Protection Reservation 
A huge jackfruit tree trunk, tumbled down by nature itself, represents the return to one’s origins and acts as a historical and cultural reference to honor the ancestral fathers and mothers of Pataxó families who recently moved into this Indian protection area. Their huts, spread around original Atlantic Forest woods, retain the original formats, giving visitors the impression of being back 500 years in time to pre-Columbian Brazil.

The Discovery Outdoors Museum
An outdoors, natural museum, whose “art galleries” are its beaches, valleys and natural trails and whose “collection” is a set of geographical formations and traditional villages, disposed as art works in permanent exhibition, engraved in ancient media, which are spread along the length of Bahia’s historical southern coastline.

==Transport==
===Airway===
Porto Seguro Airport was opened in 1982. Its passenger terminal was very simple and small; this building is now occupied by the Fire Department of the city. In 1997, the airport was reopened, having received a new passenger terminal, new aircraft parking lot, and extension of runway to operate large aircraft. In 2010 the airport had some major renovations preparing the city to host several of the International football teams who had a training camp in Porto Seguro for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

<text>Paqarina is a Quechua term that ancient Andeans used to describe the place of origin, and final destination, of their ancestors. &quot;Paqarinas&quot; were associated with physical landmarks such as holes in the ground or lakes. In Incan mythology the word also describes a type of &quot;portal&quot; through which the forces of life and death flow.

<text>SABC 3, also branded as S3, is a South African free-to-air television channel owned by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). Since March 2024, it carries programming in English and Afrikaans only. 

==History==
On 1 January 1982, two television services were introduced: TV2 broadcasting in Zulu and Xhosa and TV3 broadcasting in Sotho and Tswana, both targeted at a Black urban audience. The main network, then called TV1, was divided evenly between English and Afrikaans, as before. In 1986, a new service called TV4 was introduced, carrying sports and entertainment programming, sharing the same television frequency used by TV2 and TV3; the new service started broadcasting at 9.30pm.

In 1991, TV2, TV3 and TV4 were merged into a new service called CCV (Contemporary Community Values). A third network was introduced known as TSS, or TopSport Surplus, TopSport being the brand name for the SABC&#x27;s sport coverage, but this was replaced by NNTV (National Network TV), an educational, non-commercial channel, in 1994.
In 1996, the SABC reorganised its three TV channels with the aim of making them more representative of the various language groups. These new channels were called SABC 1, SABC 2 and SABC 3.

SABC3 inherited many of its programs from TV1, South Africa&#x27;s apartheid-era &quot;white&quot; channel. SABC 3 is targeted at South Africa&#x27;s affluent English-speaking community; the channel&#x27;s primary target market is viewers aged 18 to 49. It screens a combination of international programming from the United States and United Kingdom, as well as locally produced soap operas, talk shows and drama series. SABC 3&#x27;s new format stemmed largely from a 1997 decision to commercialise the broadacaster, reducing the amount of documentary content that it previously broadcast since the days of NNTV. The new line-up was driven by ratings.

SABC 3 moved its main news from 8pm to 7pm on 7 April 2003. It was rumoured that the new time was to compete with e.tv&#x27;s main bulletin, which was on at the same time, but these rumours were denied by Jimi Matthews, who had moved from the rival broadcaster.

The channel&#x27;s HD broadcasts began on 11 June 2018, in time for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, alongside SABC 1. As of June 2018, the channel started broadcasting in high definition.

In April 2021, the channel rebranded and is stylised as S3.

==Programming==
SABC 3 has deals with studio companies in the US and various television networks in the UK to air some series with a few months&#x27; delay from their international airdates.

=== Soapies, dramas and telenovelas ===
The channel is known for its longest-running soapie &quot;Isidingo&quot;, and previously aired local dramas such as&quot; High Rollers&quot;, and popular international soaps &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, which SABC 3 stopped airing because of financial constraints. This upset viewers fond of the soapie and started a petition to keep the show running. The channel currently offers international dramas such as &quot;Knightfall&quot;, &quot;NCIS&quot;, &quot;House of Cards&quot;, &quot;MotherFatherSon&quot;, &quot;Line of Duty&quot;, &quot;El Chapo,&quot; and &quot;Killing Eve&quot;. In April 2021, the channel introduced a new local drama &quot;The Estate&quot; and new telenovelas &quot;Orphans Of A Nation&quot;, &quot;The Bay&quot; and &quot;The Red Room&quot;.

=== Children and education ===

The channel has local children&#x27;s content such as Challenge SOS, Talent on Track, Yum.Me and Hectic on 3, along with and international catalogue of kids and teens entertainment from Disney and Nickelodeon. This includes kids shows such as &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot;, &quot;Go Jetters&quot; and &quot;My Friends Tigger &amp; Pooh&quot;, as well as teen shows such as &quot;Victorious&quot;, &quot;iCarly&quot;, &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot;, &quot;Shake It Up&quot;, &quot;Cory in the House&quot;, &quot;Girl Meets World&quot;, &quot;Sam &amp; Cat&quot;, &quot;Winx Club&quot;, &quot;Violetta&quot;, &quot;Polly Pocket&quot;, &quot;Kuu Kuu Harajuku&quot;, &quot;Sanjay and Craig&quot;, &quot;Henry Danger&quot;, &quot;Nowhere Boys&quot;, &quot;Noah &amp; Saskia&quot;, &quot;Spellbinder&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Mortified&quot;, &quot;Legacy of the Silver Shadow&quot;, &quot;Crash Zone&quot; and &quot;Hectic on 3&quot;. Unlike its sister channels, SABC 3 has less programming from the SABC Education banner.

=== Series ===
SABC 3 used to license and produce local versions of international series like &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, and &quot;Top Chef&quot;. The South African adaptions of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; and &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; have been off air and out of production for longer than 10 years.

In 2017, Hlaudi Motsoeneng who was then COO of the SABC, decreed that SABC TV stations should broadcast 90% local content. The decree turned out to be unsuccessful, as the local productions were the least watched on the channel. After some time, their flagship international series returned, such as Survivor and The Amazing Race. The channel currently has reality series such as Judge Faith, Ready for Love and Christina Milian:Turned up. The channel also offers nature documentaries from National Geographic and BBC Earth.

In March 2024, SABC 3 announced a partnership with BBC Studios, under which it would broadcast a nightly block on weeknights known as BBC PRIMETIME beginning 1 May, which would feature airings of dramas and factual programmes from its library. The agreement also includes streaming content on SABC+.

=== Music ===
The channel also focuses on adult contemporary and urban music and has music specials from local and international artists. Shows like The Mic, Base 3 and Tapestry are aired on the channel. SABC 3 broadcasts Koze Kuse from SABC 1 from August 2019 to April 2021.

=== Talk and magazine ===
SABC 3 has a heavy focus on local and international talk and magazines such as the breakfast show &quot;Expresso&quot;, &quot;Afternoon Express&quot;, &quot;The Real&quot;, &quot;The Scoop&quot; and &quot;Harry&quot;.

=== Sports ===

<text>Nicholas Gregory Mankiw ( ; born February 3, 1958) is an American macroeconomist who is currently the Robert M. Beren Professor of Economics at Harvard University. Mankiw is best known in academia for his work on New Keynesian economics.

Mankiw has written widely on economics and economic policy. , the RePEc overall ranking based on academic publications, citations, and related metrics put him as the 45th most influential economist in the world, out of nearly 50,000 registered authors. He was the 11th most cited economist and the 9th most productive research economist as measured by the h-index. In addition, Mankiw is the author of several best-selling textbooks, writes a popular blog, and from 2007 to 2021 wrote regularly for the Sunday business section of &quot;The New York Times.&quot; According to the Open Syllabus Project, Mankiw is the most frequently cited author on college syllabi for economics courses.

Mankiw is a conservative, and has been an economic adviser to several Republican politicians. From 2003 to 2005, Mankiw was Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. In 2006, he became an economic adviser to Mitt Romney, and worked with Romney during his presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012. In October 2019, he announced that he was no longer a Republican because of his discontent with President Donald Trump and the Republican Party.

==Early life and education==
Mankiw was born in Trenton, New Jersey. His grandparents were all Ukrainians. He grew up in Cranford, New Jersey, where he worked in Republican politics, and graduated from the Pingry School in 1976. In 1975, he studied astrophysics at the Summer Science Program. He graduated from Princeton University &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1980 with a Bachelor of Arts in economics. Mankiw completed a 72-page long senior thesis titled &quot;Understanding Employment Fluctuation&quot;. At Princeton, Mankiw was classmates with the economist David Romer, who would later become one of his coauthors, and was roommates with the playwright Richard Greenberg.

After college, Mankiw spent a year working on his doctoral degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a subsequent year studying at Harvard Law School. He worked as a staff economist for the Council of Economic Advisers from 1982 to 1983, which he went on to chair two decades later. After leaving the council, he earned his PhD in economics from MIT in 1984 under the supervision of Stanley Fischer. He returned to Harvard Law School for a year, but having completed his PhD and realizing that he was better at economics, he left to teach at MIT for a year, and then became an assistant professor of economics at Harvard University in 1985. He was promoted to professor in 1987, at the age of 29.

==Academic writings==
Mankiw is considered a New Keynesian economist, though at least one financial journalist states that he resists such easy categorisation. Mankiw did important work on menu costs, which are a source of price stickiness. His paper &quot;Small Menu Costs and Large Business Cycles: A Macroeconomic Model of Monopoly&quot;, which was published in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot; in 1985, compared a firm&#x27;s private incentive to adjust prices after a shock to nominal aggregate demand with that decision&#x27;s social welfare implications. The paper concluded that expansion in aggregate demand may either increase welfare or reduce it, but the welfare reduction is never greater than the menu cost. A contraction in aggregate demand, however, reduces welfare, possibly in an amount much larger than the menu cost. In other words, from a social planner&#x27;s point of view, prices may be stuck too high but never too low. The paper was a building block for work by Olivier Blanchard and Nobuhiro Kiyotaki on aggregate-demand externalities and for work by Laurence M. Ball and David Romer on the interaction between real and nominal rigidities.

In 2002, Mankiw and Ricardo Reis proposed an alternative to the widely-used New Keynesian Phillips curve that is based on the slow diffusion of information among the population of price setters. Their sticky-information model displays three related properties that are more consistent with accepted views about the effects of monetary policy. Firstly, disinflations are always contractionary, though announced disinflations are less contractionary than surprise ones. Secondly, monetary policy shocks have their maximum impact on inflation with a substantial delay. Thirdly, the change in inflation is positively correlated with the level of economic activity.

A related 2003 article by Mankiw, Reis, and Justin Wolfers analyzed data on inflation expectations and documented substantial disagreement among both consumers and professional economists about expected future inflation. That disagreement is shown to vary over time and to move with inflation, the absolute value of the change in inflation, and relative price variability. The paper argues that a satisfactory model of economic dynamics must address those business-cycle moments. Noting that most macroeconomic models do not endogenously generate disagreement, they show that a sticky-information model broadly matches many of those facts. The model is also consistent with other observed departures of inflation expectations from full rationality, including autocorrelated forecast errors and insufficient sensitivity to recent macroeconomic news.

Mankiw has also written several papers on the empirical analysis of consumer behavior, often emphasizing the role of heterogeneity. An article with John Campbell in 1989 found that the aggregate consumption data are best described by a model in which about half of consumers obey the permanent income hypothesis, and half simply consume their current income, which is sometimes called hand-to-mouth behavior. An article with Stephen Zeldes in 1991 found the consumption of stockholders to covary more strongly with the stock market than the consumption of nonstockholders did. That provided a possible explanation for the equity premium puzzle.

Mankiw&#x27;s most widely-cited paper is &quot;A Contribution to the Empirics of Economic Growth&quot;, which was coauthored with David Romer and David Weil and published in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot; in 1992. The paper argues that the Solow growth model, once augmented to include a role for human capital, explains reasonably well international differences in standards of living. According to Google Scholar, it has been cited more than 25,000 times, which makes it one of the most cited articles in the field of economics.

Beyond his work in macroeconomics, Mankiw has also written several other notable papers. In 1989, he coauthored a paper with David Weil that examined the demographic determinants of housing demand and predicted that the aging of baby boomers would undermine the housing market in the 1990s and 2000s. In 1986, he coauthored a paper with Michael Whinston in microeconomic theory that showed that under imperfect competition, entry tends to be excessive in homogeneous-goods industries because entrants fail to take into account the business-stealing externality that they impose on their rivals. When goods are heterogeneous, it is ambiguous whether free entry produces too many or too few firms because of offsetting business-stealing and product-variety externalities.

==Textbooks==
Mankiw has written two popular college-level textbooks: the intermediate-level &quot;Macroeconomics&quot; (now in its 12th edition, published by Worth Publishers) and the more famous introductory text &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; (now in its 10th edition, published by Cengage). Subsets of chapters from the latter book are sold under the titles &quot;Principles of Microeconomics&quot;, &quot;Principles of Macroeconomics&quot;, &quot;Brief Principles of Macroeconomics&quot;, and &quot;Essentials of Economics&quot;. The book was signed for a record advance. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 1995 that Mankiw &quot;was offered a $1.4 million advance by Harcourt Brace in Fort Worth to write a basic economics textbook. That&#x27;s about three times as big as any other in the college textbook market and rivals those of all but a few celebrity authors.&quot;

When the first edition of the &quot;Principles&quot; book was published in 1997, &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine stated,

Since then, more than one million copies have been sold, and Mankiw has received an estimated $42 million in royalties from the book, which is priced at $280 per copy.

==Other career activities==
In May 2003, President George W. Bush appointed Mankiw as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Mankiw served in that post from 2003 to 2005 and was followed by Harvey S. Rosen and then Ben Bernanke. As chairman, Mankiw was part of a George W. Bush administration effort seeking greater oversight of two government-sponsored enterprises: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In a November 2003 speech to a conference of bank supervisors, he said:

The proposed regulatory reforms were passed into law only years later, when the financial crisis of 2007–2008 was well underway.

After leaving the CEA, Mankiw resumed teaching at Harvard and took over one of the most popular classes at Harvard College, the introductory economics course Ec 10, from Martin Feldstein. He has become an influential figure in the blogosphere and online journalism since launching his eponymous blog. The blog, which was originally designed to assist his Ec10 students, has gained a readership that extends far beyond students of introductory economics. Subtitled &quot;Random Observations for Students of Economics,&quot; it was ranked the top economics blog by US economics professors in a 2011 survey.

In November 2006, Mankiw became an official economic adviser to Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney&#x27;s political action committee, Commonwealth PAC. In 2007, he signed on as an economic adviser to Romney&#x27;s presidential campaign. He continued in that role during Romey&#x27;s 2012 presidential bid.

From 2012 to 2015, Mankiw served as chairman of the Harvard economics department.

In February 2013, Mankiw publicly supported same-sex marriage in the United States in an amicus brief submitted to the US Supreme Court.

Mankiw is a trustee of the Urban Institute. In 2016, he became a member of the US Partnership on Mobility from Poverty, an effort funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and run by the Urban Institute. The group of 24 scholars and activists is &quot;a new collaborative aimed at discovering permanent ladders of mobility for the poor. The partnership will identify breakthrough solutions that can be put into action by philanthropy, practitioners, and the public and private sectors.&quot;

===2004 Economic Report of the President===
Several controversies arose from CEA&#x27;s February 2004 Economic Report of the President. In a press conference, Mankiw spoke of the gains from free trade and noted that the outsourcing of jobs by US companies is &quot;probably a plus for the economy in the long run.&quot; This reflected mainstream economic analysis, but was criticized by many politicians, who drew a link between outsourcing and the slow recovery of the US labor market in early 2004.

Controversy also arose from a rhetorical question posed by the report and repeated by Mankiw in a speech about the report: &quot;when a fast-food restaurant sells a hamburger, is it providing a service or combining inputs to manufacture a product?&quot; He intended to point out that the distinction between manufacturing jobs and service industry jobs is somewhat arbitrary and so is a poor basis for policy. Even though the issue was not raised in the report, a news account led to criticism that the administration was seeking to cover up job losses in manufacturing by redefining jobs like cooking hamburgers as manufacturing.

===2011 student walkout===
On November 2, 2011, a number of students in Mankiw&#x27;s Economics 10 class walked out of his lecture. Several dozen of the 750 students participated. Before leaving, they handed Mankiw an open letter critical of his course that stated in part:
The students concluded their letter by stating that they would instead be attending the underway Occupy Boston demonstration. Counterprotesters showed up in that class, and Mankiw replied to his students in an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. An editorial in the student-run &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; condemned the protest by
stating:

===2016 opposition to Donald Trump===

In August 2016, Mankiw expressed opposition to the election of Donald Trump to the presidency. On his blog, he wrote:
===2019 departure from Republican Party===
On October 28, 2019, Mankiw left the Republican Party and registered as an independent. He cited his disappointment in the party&#x27;s overlooking of President Trump&#x27;s misdeeds and a wish to vote in either primary in his home state, Massachusetts.

===Advocacy of Pigovian taxation===
Throughout his career, Mankiw has advocated the implementation of Pigovian taxes, such as a revenue-neutral carbon tax, to correct for externalities. Toward that end, he founded on his blog the informal Pigou Club. In 2016, he had a part in the Leonardo DiCaprio film &quot;Before the Flood&quot;, a documentary about global climate change, and was interviewed in the film on carbon taxation. In 2017, Mankiw was one of eight &quot;Republican elder statesmen&quot; to propose for conservatives embrace of a policy of carbon taxes, with all revenue rebated as lump-sum dividends. The group also included James A. Baker III, Martin S. Feldstein, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and George P. Shultz.

<doc id="453983" wikidata="Q767456" url="?curid=453983" title="Gothic (video game)">
<text>Gothic is a 2001 action role-playing video game developed by Piranha Bytes for Microsoft Windows and the first game of the game series of the same name. It was released on 15 March 2001 in Germany, on 30 October 2001 in Europe, on 23 November 2001 in North America and on 28 March 2002 in Poland. A Nintendo Switch port, titled &quot;Gothic Classic&quot;, was released worldwide on September 28, 2023.

&quot;Gothic&quot; was well received by critics. Reviewers credited the game for its story, complex interaction with other in-game characters, and graphics, but criticized it for having many bugs, an unusual control scheme and high system requirements.

In 2020, THQ Nordic, who owns the series after the acquisition and subsequent dissolution of Piranha Bytes, greenlit a &quot;Gothic&quot; remake for production. 

== Gameplay ==
The main character must complete quests and slay wild animals and monsters to earn &quot;skill points&quot;, which are used to increase basic attributes and learn and improve skills. They are spent by finding the appropriate teacher. Several skills have only one &quot;level&quot; (Sneaking, Acrobatics), while Pickpocketing and the fighting skills (one-handed weapons, two-handed weapons, bows and crossbows) have two proficiency levels. If the Hero chooses to be a Mage (or joins the Swamp Camp), he will be able to learn Circles of Magic; of which there are 6. The main attributes are increased in 1 or 5 point increments, starting at 10 and capping off at 100. The cap can be surpassed with the use of potions.

The game places a special focus on the interactivity of the environment. For example, hunting wild animals can earn the player raw meat. This heals damage and can be sold. However, by using a stove or frying pan, the player may also choose to turn this into grilled meat, which heals much more effectively. Similarly, most of the activities other characters can be seen doing (playing musical instruments, stirring soup pots, urinating etc.) can be done by the main character as well (although with the exception of forging weapons these activities have little bearing on the game).

The player can choose which camp to join, although quests get increasingly linear and the distinctions between different factions wane in the latter parts of the game. The major difference is that Swamp Camp members cannot become mages, because they are limited to four magic circles (out of six). However, they gain access to magic earlier.

== Synopsis ==
=== Setting ===
The game takes place in a open world medieval fantasy realm in which humans are fighting a losing war against the Orcs, a humanoid race. In order to fight back, the king needs to extract magical ore from mines, which can be used to forge more powerful weapons and armor. Therefore he decides to send every man who has committed a crime to the ore mines.

To prevent the convicts from escaping he orders his 12 most powerful magicians to erect a magical dome over the mining colony, which will later be called the Barrier. However, the Barrier goes out of control and grows large enough to cover the entire valley, trapping the magicians inside, and giving the convicts a chance to kill the distracted guards and take control over the colony. The king is thus forced to come to an agreement with the prisoners, trading goods for ore.

Soon after, the convicts separate into three different groups: the Old Camp which controls trading with the king, the New Camp which refuses to trade the ore they mine, and instead plan to use its magical power to explode the Barrier, and the Brotherhood, whose members produce and trade Swampweed with the other camps and believe in a god called the Sleeper which will help them escape from the colony. The magicians that created the Barrier also divided; they formed the Fire Mages, who joined the Old Camp, and the Water Mages, who joined the New Camp.

=== Plot ===
The player takes control of an unnamed prisoner who has just been thrown inside the mining colony. The exposition does not specify the crime for which he was convicted prior to the games&#x27; events. Before being sent in, the player receives a letter which he is tasked to deliver to the Order of the Magicians of Fire, which is stationed inside of the Old Camp. After getting the chance to talk with the magicians, the protagonist learns that Xardas, the head of the Fire Mages who is supposed to receive the letter, deserted in order to study black magic.

After joining one of the three camps, the protagonist ends up aiding the Sect Camp prepare the invocation of their god, the Sleeper, which they believe will show them the way to escape the colony. During the ritual the members have a vague vision and Y&#x27;Berion, the leader of the Brotherhood who performed the ritual, collapses after getting in contact with the Sleeper. In the vision, the sect members are shown the way to an old Orc cemetery. A guru and a few templars, together with the hero, set off towards the indicated place. Once there, however, the templars die fighting the Orcs they meet, and only the guru and the protagonist survive. After searching the entire underground complex the two fail to find anything. The guru then goes insane and starts accusing the hero that it is because of him that the Sleeper refuses to reveal himself, and attempts to kill the protagonist.

After defeating the mad guru, the hero returns to the camp of the Brotherhood where he finds Y&#x27;Berion still weakened after the ritual. Despite efforts to help him recover, Y&#x27;Berion soon dies. Before dying, however, he warns the rest of the camp about the true, evil, nature of the god they thought was leading them on the path to freedom, and places his hopes on the escape plan of the Water Mages from the New Camp to blow up the Barrier using the power of the magical ore.

Bearing important information about the recent events in the Sect Camp, the player is given permission to see the Water Mages, who ask for help with their escape plan. After the hero acquires all the needed artifacts with the help of four convicts he has befriended, the Water Mages now need the help of the Fire Mages to channel the magical energy. However, the protagonist finds out the Old Camp&#x27;s gates have been closed after their ore mine collapsed. Fearful that this incident might deprive him of his power, the leader of the Old Camp sent his men to take control of the New Camp&#x27;s mine and killed the Fire Mages who were protesting against his action; only Milten, the youngest of the magicians, managed to escape.

Having no other option left, the Water Mages send the hero to ask for Xardas, the magician who deserted the Fire Mages, to help them. However, Xardas refuses to help the Magicians of Water and thinks that their plan will not succeed. He instead tells the protagonist that during his studies he learned that the Sleeper was summoned by the Orcs in order to help them against their enemies and that the demon is in a temple deep underneath the Orc city. With the help of Xardas, the player manages to enter the Sleeper&#x27;s temple. Upon defeating the demon, the Barrier collapses and sets the prisoners of the colony free.

== Development ==
German company Piranha Bytes worked more than four years on the development of &quot;Gothic&quot;″s technology. The game engine was created completely in-house with a modified version later used for &quot;Gothic II&quot;. These are the only games to use this engine.

== Variations ==

* In the German version the medieval rock band In Extremo has a virtual performance in the Old Camp, where they perform their acoustic cover of &quot;Herr Mannelig&quot;. As long as the player is in the second chapter, the band plays next to the entrance to the castle. The performance has been removed from non-German publications for licensing reasons.
* The US version of &quot;Gothic&quot; was slightly censored: a bathing slave was given a bra that she does not wear in the German version.
* &quot;Gothic&quot; also has a more or less hidden side quest towards the end of the game, in which the hero has to find the Chromanin&#x27;s books. This quest, which operates like a scavenger hunt, was included with the second patch to version 1.08h.

== Marketing and release ==
&quot;Gothic&quot; was first released on 15 March 2001 in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, published by Egmont Interactive. The European release date by THQ arrived on 30 October 2001, followed by the North American release by Xicat Interactive on 23 November 2001.

In February 2006, an international re-release was announced to prepare for &quot;Gothic 3&quot; – which received much more attention from international media than the previous games.

In the course of the re-release, an English demo version was made available at the official website. The demo contains a part of the first chapter of the game.

In Germany and some other countries, &quot;Gothic&quot; is also available in a collector&#x27;s edition, bundled with &quot;Gothic II&quot; and &quot;Gothic II: Night of the Raven&quot;, and &quot;Gothic – Fan Edition&quot;, including the official map of the Colony and a variety of extras.

== Reception ==
According to GameStar, &quot;Gothic&quot; failed to make an &quot;international breakthrough&quot; into sales markets beyond Germany, a characteristic it shared with &quot;Anno 1602&quot;.

The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN concluded that &quot;&quot;Gothic&quot; is a solid role-playing experience&quot; and Eurogamer said that it is a game that &quot;developers should look to as an example of how a role-playing adventure &quot;should&quot; be done&quot;. GameSpot gave the game a slightly less positive review saying that despite &quot;Gothic&quot;″s achievements in terms of story and dialog, players might still be disappointed by its shallow character development and poor combat mechanics.

GameLive PC named &quot;Gothic&quot; the third-best role-playing game of 2001–2002 behind &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; and &quot;The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&quot;. The editors of Computer Games Magazine nominated &quot;Gothic&quot; as the best role-playing game of 2001, but ultimately gave the award to &quot;&quot; and &quot;Wizardry 8&quot; (tie). It was also a runner-up for RPG Vault&#x27;s 2001 &quot;RPG of the Year&quot; prize, which it lost again to &quot;Arcanum&quot;. However, it won in the publication&#x27;s &quot;Surprise of the Year&quot; category; the editors called it &quot;a very solid, enjoyable debut effort&quot;.

In 2022, it has been described as „probably the most known Eurojank title“.

<text>Mem de Sá (c. 1500 – 2 March 1572) was a Governor-General of the Portuguese colony of Brazil from 1557 to 1572. He was born in Coimbra, Kingdom of Portugal, around 1500, the year of discovery of Brazil by a naval fleet commanded by Pedro Álvares Cabral.

In the early sixteenth century, Brazil was not a major settled area of the Portuguese empire. The Jesuits had established aldeias in order to evangelize the Brazilian Indians. Portuguese settlers actively enslaved the indigenous populations. Mem de Sá was nominated the third Governor-General of Brazil in 1556, succeeding Duarte da Costa, who was Governor-General from 1553 to 1557. The seat of the government at the time was Salvador, in the present-day state of Bahia.

He was fortunate in securing the support of two important Jesuit priests, Fathers Manuel da Nóbrega (1517-1570) and José de Anchieta (1533-1597), who founded São Paulo, on 25 January 1554, which is today one of the largest metropolises in the world. The Jesuits were stern and persistent missionaries of the Catholic faith with the indigenous people, and their pacification of these warrior societies was one of the most important conquests of Mem de Sá&#x27;s government. The Jesuits had conflicts with Duarte da Costa, because he supported the plantation owners, who tried to force slavery upon the Indians. Mem de Sá opposed the usury of the Portuguese plantation owners in their trade in Indian slaves and helped the Jesuits expand the number of their aldeias.

Mem de Sá also had an important military and political mission when, in 1560, leading a naval expedition of 26 ships and 2,000 soldiers and sailors, he was sent by the Portuguese crown to attack &quot;France Antarctique&quot;, a colony founded by Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon, a Catholic French vice-admiral on the site of present-day Rio de Janeiro. Fort Coligny, built by the French colonists on a small island of the Guanabara Bay was destroyed, but Mem de Sá was able to expel definitely the French invaders in 1567 only, with the help of his nephew, Estácio de Sá, who was also the founder of Rio de Janeiro on 1 March 1565. With the help of the Jesuits, Mem de Sá was able to convince the Tamoyo Confederation to withdraw their support to the Frenchmen.

Mem de Sá died on 2 March 1572, in Salvador.
