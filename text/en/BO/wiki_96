<text>Anthony David McPartlin (born 18 November 1975) is an English television presenter, former singer, rapper and actor. He is best known for working alongside Declan Donnelly as part of the presenting duo Ant &amp; Dec.

McPartlin came to prominence, alongside Donnelly, in the children&#x27;s drama series &quot;Byker Grove&quot;, with both of the boys establishing successful careers as television presenters, in which they presented &quot;SMTV Live&quot; (between 1998 and 2001), &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; and &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; (2002–2024), and &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; (since 2007).

Other notable highlights of McPartlin&#x27;s career alongside Donnelly include presenting &quot;PokerFace&quot;, &quot;Push the Button&quot;, &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, and &quot;Red or Black?&quot;, being hosts of charity appeal &quot;Text Santa&quot; (between 2011 and 2014), and also performing as pop music duo PJ &amp; Duncan.

==Career==
McPartlin&#x27;s first appearance on television was on the children&#x27;s workshop programme &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You?&quot;, but his big break came when he rose to prominence playing the character of PJ in the CBBC series &quot;Byker Grove&quot;. It was during his time on the programme that he first met Declan Donnelly, who was cast in the part of Duncan. The pair formed a close friendship on the programme, both socially and professionally, with the men performing as their characters until their departure from the programme in 1993. During their tenure, the pair created a number of hit records under the label of &quot;PJ &amp; Duncan AKA&quot;, including the song &quot;Tonight I&#x27;m Free&quot; that had been performed on &quot;Byker Grove&quot;.

From then onwards, McPartlin and Donnelly worked together on television, creating the presenting duo of Ant &amp; Dec. Initially, the pair continued to work in children&#x27;s television with the Saturday morning hit &quot;SMTV Live&quot;, before they eventually branched out into gameshows – &quot;Friends Like These&quot;, &quot;PokerFace&quot; and &quot;Push the Button&quot; – along with talent shows – &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, and &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; – and entertainment programmes – &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, and &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;. The pair continued to maintain work in acting, starring in a tribute to &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;, in the form of a remake of an episode from the show&#x27;s sequel &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot; entitled &quot;No Hiding Place&quot;. In 2006, McPartlin and Donnelly starred together in the film &quot;Alien Autopsy&quot;.

In 2007, it was discovered that two shows, &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Gameshow Marathon&quot; and &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;, which he co-presented with Donnelly, had defrauded viewers participating in phone-ins. The latter was produced by the pair&#x27;s own production company.

In April 2009, Ant &amp; Dec achieved wide international exposure when, as backstage commentators for &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, they interviewed contestant Susan Boyle, whose audition would become the most-viewed YouTube video of the year and whose record album topped sales charts in dozens of countries.

==Personal life==
On 22 July 2006, McPartlin married his longtime girlfriend, make-up artist Lisa Armstrong at Cliveden, a country house hotel in Buckinghamshire. The couple were married for 11 years before eventually announcing on 15 January 2018 that they were divorcing.

McPartlin was a fervent Labour Party supporter until the 2010 election, when he voted for the Conservative Party. In February 2013, he told &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper that he would struggle to justify voting for either political party in the future.

In 2015, McPartlin went into hospital for an operation to treat his knee and was advised to take prescription drugs to combat pain after the surgery was botched. Over the course of the following two years, he slowly became addicted to codeine &amp; prescription drugs (one of which being the opioid OxyContin) along with alcohol, including use before television appearances. 

In June 2017, he sought treatment for his addiction to prescription drugs and checked himself in for rehabilitation; he was released two months later.

On 18 March 2018 McPartlin was involved in a road traffic collision in London, after which he was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving. The following day, on 19 March, he met with Donnelly and ITV and suspended further presenting duties to return to rehab for further treatment. On 16 April 2018, he was interviewed under caution and subsequently charged with drink-driving. McPartlin pleaded guilty to the offence at Wimbledon Magistrates&#x27; Court the following month, and was banned from driving for 20 months and fined £86,000, believed to be Britain&#x27;s highest-ever penalty for drink-driving at the time. He had previously been banned from driving for 30 days and fined £350 for driving at on the A1(M) motorway in 2002.

In August 2018 McPartlin announced he would be taking a break from television presenting duties until 2019, saying: &quot;My recovery is going very well and for that to continue having spoken to Dec and ITV, I have made the decision to take the rest of the year off.&quot;

In January 2019, McPartlin returned to his television duties alongside Donnelly at the &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; auditions. The same month, he disclosed that he had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

On 7 August 2021, McPartlin married Anne-Marie Corbett, who was formerly his personal assistant, at St Michael&#x27;s Church in Heckfield, Hampshire. They had been in a relationship since 2018. On 14 May 2024, Corbett gave birth to a baby boy.

==Charity==
McPartlin and Donnelly are patrons of the charity Sunshine Fund. When their single &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ready to Rhumble&quot; reached No.1, Ant &amp; Dec donated the single&#x27;s success to the charity ChildLine. They also support the Text Santa appeal.

They opened the W4 Youth Centre in 2013.

==Earnings==

In 2002, Ant &amp; Dec signed a two-year golden handcuffs deal with ITV, worth £2m.

In 2004 they signed their third golden handcuffs deal with ITV, running until the end of 2007.

In April 2007, the duo signed a two-year golden handcuffs deal with ITV, reportedly worth £30–40 million, securing their career at the station until the end of 2009.

In 2009 they extended their golden handcuffs deal for two years. In 2011 they extended their golden handcuffs deal for two years.

In November 2016 the pair signed a new three-year deal with ITV, estimated to be worth £30 million over 3 years.

<text>The Ninth Army was a field army of the United States Army, most recently garrisoned at Caserma Ederle, Vicenza, Italy. It was the United States Army Service Component Command of United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM or AFRICOM).

Activated just eight weeks before the June 1944 Normandy landings, the Ninth Army was one of the main U.S. Army combat commands used during the campaign in Northwest Europe in 1944 and 1945. It was commanded at its inception by Lieutenant General William Simpson. It had been designated Eighth Army, but on arrival in the United Kingdom it was renamed to avoid confusion with the famous British formation of the same designation, taking the name of a unit of the fictitious First United States Army Group prepared for Operation Quicksilver. All American field armies in the European Theatre of Operation were designated with odd numbers; even numbered field armies served in the Pacific Theatre of Operations.

==History==
The first responsibility for Ninth Army, upon its arrival on 5 September was to take part in the final reduction of the German forces holding out in the French port of Brest. After the surrender of the town fifteen days later, Ninth Army was sent east to take its place in the line. It came into the line between Third Army and First Army.

In November, Ninth Army was shifted to the very northern flank of 12th Army Group. It undertook operations to close the front up to the Roer River. 16 December saw the opening of the last great German offensive of the war, the Battle of the Bulge. Ninth Army was isolated from the headquarters of 12th Army Group, and it was thus placed (on 20 December) under the command of General Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s 21st Army Group along with First Army, despite opposition from General Omar Bradley. Simpson reoriented his command quickly to help in the reduction of the salient that the Germans had created. Many of Ninth Army&#x27;s units passed to the command of First Army, which was doing the main work of reducing the German salient from the north. In the meantime, the remainder of Ninth Army continued to hold the line along the Roer. When First Army and Third Army had finished reducing the salient, First Army returned to the command of 12th Army Group, but Ninth Army remained under the command of 21st Army Group for the remainder of the Rhineland Campaign.

In late February 1945 the Ninth Army launched Operation Grenade, which was the southern prong of a pincer attack coordinated with Canadian First Army&#x27;s Operation Veritable, with the purpose of closing the front up to the Rhine. By 10 March, the Rhine had been reached in all sectors of Ninth Army&#x27;s front. It was not until after 20 March that Ninth Army units first crossed the Rhine itself (Operation Flashpoint). However, after doing so, the Army quickly struck east around the north of the Ruhr. An enormous pocket soon formed containing the German Army Group B under Walter Model. By 4 April, Ninth Army had reached the Weser and was switched back to 12th Army Group.

The end was now clearly in sight, and as part of Ninth Army, along with the newly arrived Fifteenth Army, reduced the enormous Ruhr Pocket, other elements reached the Elbe on 12 April. On 2 May 1945, the whole of Ninth Army&#x27;s front reached the agreed demarcation point with the Russians, and the advance ceased. Around 7 May 1945, the Ninth Army accepted around 100,000 prisoners from the German Twelfth Army under General Walther Wenck, and the German Ninth Army (Germany) under General Theodor Busse.

On 15 June 1945 the units of the Ninth Army were turned over to the Seventh United States Army and the Ninth Army headquarters prepared to redeploy to China to support combat operations against the Japanese. On 8 July Ninth Army headquarters had moved to Deauville, France to prepare for re-deployment to the United States. On 27 July the headquarters boarded the Army transport ship &quot;John Ericsson&quot; bound for New York City, where it arrived on 6 August, the same date of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The headquarters then was moved to Camp Shanks, New York for administrative processing prior to deployment to China. 

The Japanese surrendered on 15 August and the planned deployment to China was cancelled. The headquarters was moved to Fort Bragg, North Carolina in mid-September for demobilization and was inactivated on 10 October 1945. 

==Units==
Units included the 2nd Infantry Division, the 8th Infantry Division, 8th Armored Division, the 2nd Ranger Battalion, the 5th Ranger Battalion, the 29th Infantry Division, the 30th Infantry Division, the 6th Armored Division, the 104th Infantry Division, the 7th Armored Division, and the 79th Infantry Division.

==Reactivation==
In 2012, U.S. Army Africa was re-designated as US Army Africa (Ninth Army) under the Army modularization program.

Following its reformation, the army controlled the following units;

* United States Army Africa Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, Caserma Carlo Ederle, Italy
* 207th Military Intelligence Brigade (Operational Control)
* 1st Infantry Division (Aligned), Fort Riley, Kansas
** 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division (Aligned), Fort Riley, Kansas
* 82nd Civil Affairs Battalion, Fort Stewart, Georgia
* OUA Division, Liberia
** Engineering Brigade, Liberia
In 2020, U.S. Army Africa was merged with U.S. Army Europe to form a new command, U.S. Army Europe-Africa.

==Insignia==
The nine-sided figure indicates the numerical designation of the organization. The shoulder sleeve insignia was approved on 21 September 1944. The red and white colors reflect that the headquarters of the Ninth Army was the headquarters of the Fourth Army under a new name

<text>The New Zealand swan (Moriori: &#x27;, Cygnus sumnerensis&quot;&quot;&#x27;) is an extinct indigenous swan from the Chatham Islands and the South Island of New Zealand. Discovered as archaeological remains in 1889, it was originally considered a separate species from the Australian black swan (&quot;Cygnus atratus&quot;) because of its slightly larger bones, and swans not having been introduced to New Zealand until 1864. From 1998 until 2017, it was considered to be simply a New Zealand population of &quot;Cygnus atratus&quot;, until DNA recovered from fossil bones determined that it was indeed a separate species, much larger and heavier than its Australian relative.

== Description ==
Based on numerous bone measurements, &quot;C. sumnerensis&quot; was distinctly larger than its Australian relative, weighing an estimated 10 kg to the 6 kg of &quot;C. atratus&quot;, a clear display of island gigantism. Standing about 1 m tall, it was &quot;more like a rugby player compared with the Australian swan&#x27;s (&quot;Cygnus atratus&quot;) smaller and slender soccer-player physique.&quot; It had relatively shorter wings and longer legs, suggesting it was evolving on a path towards flightlessness, as with other New Zealand waterfowl like Finsch&#x27;s duck (&quot;Chenonetta finschi)&quot; and the New Zealand goose (&quot;Cnemiornis)&quot;. Although likely to have the same black plumage as &quot;C. atratus&quot;, this cannot be determined from subfossil bones.

Until recently it was thought that the presence of &quot;C. atratus&quot; in New Zealand represented one of the very rare cases of a species replacing itself after extinction. After the extinction of the poūwa, there is some evidence occasional vagrant swans arrived from Australia, but it was not until after its deliberate introduction in the 1860s that &quot;C. atratus&quot; became established and increased to a population of approximately 50,000 today. Whether &quot;C. atratus&quot; functions as an ecological surrogate of its extinct relative is unknown. Judging by the presence of their bones in middens, New Zealand swans were driven extinct by the first Polynesian settlers around AD 1450 on the mainland and AD 1650 on the Chatham Islands.

==Taxonomy==
=== Discovery ===
The first fossil swan bones in New Zealand were recovered from Monck&#x27;s Cave, Sumner, near Christchurch, in September 1889. The landowner Henry Monck had discovered bones which he presented to John T. Meeson and Henry Forbes, Director of the Canterbury Museum. They were found associated with moa and fish bones, seal hair, adzes, spears, and sinkers, indicating the swans were hunted by early Māori inhabitants of the cave. Forbes described the new swan species from three coracoids and two partial humeri, naming it &quot;Chenopis sumnerensis&quot;, from its resemblance to the Australian black swan &quot;Chenopis atrata&quot; (now &quot;Cygnus atratus&quot;) and from the type locality of Sumner. Forbes noted that &quot;This Sumner cave has been closed since the introduction of &quot;Chenopsis atrata&quot; into New Zealand [in 1864–1868]&quot; so the bones could not be from introduced black swans; he also noted that they were larger than those of the Australian species.

=== Synonymy ===
By the 1950s, Forbes&#x27;s type material was considered lost, so Oliver in 1955 declared &quot;C. sumnerensis&quot; a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;, and redescribed the species, using fossil bones from the Chatham Islands, as &quot;Cygnus chathamensis&quot;. A few years later, Forbes&#x27;s specimens were rediscovered, and &quot;C. chathamensis&quot; became a junior synonym of &quot;C. sumnerensis&quot;. In 1998, Worthy compared a large collection of &quot;C. sumnerensis&quot; from Marfells Beach near Lake Grassmere with Australian swan bones, but could not find any marked differences in size or proportion. The species was thenceforth considered to be a population of the black swan that had colonised New Zealand in prehistoric times and been exterminated by early Māori settlers, and all New Zealand subfossil swan bones were assigned to &quot;C. atratus&quot;.

=== Revival of species name ===
Recovery of ancient DNA from 39 fossil bones in museums allowed the relationship between New Zealand and Australian swans to be re-examined, and it turned out the mainland New Zealand and Chatham Islands populations formed a distinct group, separated from the Australian birds by perhaps 1–2 million years. They proved sufficiently different from &quot;Cygnus atratus&quot; to be designated a separate and genetically distinct species, and the name &quot;C. sumnerensis&quot; was revived, with two separate subspecies (&quot;C. s. sumnerensis&quot; and &quot;C. s. chathamensis&quot;) for the mainland New Zealand and Chatham Islands birds, respectively. The researchers chose the Moriori name poūwa for the species, from a legend of a large bird that lived in Te Whanga lagoon on Chatham Island, and whose bones could still be found in the sand dunes.

<text>Ant &amp; Dec are a British television presenting duo consisting of Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly from Newcastle upon Tyne. After meeting as child actors on CBBC&#x27;s drama &quot;Byker Grove&quot;, they performed together as pop musicians PJ &amp; Duncan, the names of their characters from the series.

The duo have since pursued careers as television presenters, and currently host &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, and &quot;Limitless Win&quot;. Previous hosting credits include &quot;SMTV Live&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Friends Like These&quot;, &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; from 2002–2024, &quot;PokerFace&quot;, &quot;Push the Button&quot;, &quot;Red or Black?&quot;, and &quot;Text Santa&quot;. They presented the annual Brit Awards in 2001, 2015 and 2016. 

In addition to presenting, the pair are actors and both had leading roles in the 2006 film &quot;Alien Autopsy&quot;. They also have their own production company, Mitre Television. In a 2004 poll for the BBC, Ant &amp; Dec were named the eighteenth most influential people in British culture.

==Background==
McPartlin and Donnelly met while working on the second series of children&#x27;s drama &quot;Byker Grove&quot; for the BBC in 1990. After a shaky start, they soon became best friends. They have achieved such popularity as a duo that they are hardly seen apart on screen. It is reported that they are each insured against the other&#x27;s death, with the amount reportedly being around £1 million.

They are both avid supporters of their local football club, Newcastle United.

==Career==
===Acting===
Although McPartlin had gained some television experience with a brief stint on the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You?&quot;, which was broadcast on the BBC, Donnelly was the first of the two to acquire his place on the BBC children&#x27;s drama &quot;Byker Grove&quot;. He joined in 1989, playing Duncan. A year later, McPartlin joined the cast to play PJ (series 2, episode 5). Their friendship began when their storylines collided, creating a friendship both on and off-screen. &quot;Byker Grove&quot; producer Matthew Robinson told them to &quot;Stay together through any row you have, whatever it is, be together and you could be the future Morecambe and Wise. I think they have proved that in many ways.&quot;

Donnelly also played a stable boy in the film adaptation of the novel &quot;The Cinder Path&quot; in his teenage years. They also went on to co-star in the 2006 sci-fi comedy film &quot;Alien Autopsy&quot;.

===Music===

After leaving television, the duo turned their hand to pop music. Their first single was a song they performed as part of the group Grove Matrix, performed as part of the storyline in TV show &quot;Byker Grove&quot;, titled &quot;Tonight I&#x27;m Free&quot;. The single had some success, and the duo recorded two albums under their character names of PJ &amp; Duncan. Their most famous hit during this period was the BRIT Award nominated &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ready To Rhumble&quot;, for which the video and moves were choreographed by Mark Short, who had previously worked with Tina Turner and Peter Andre. For their third album, the duo reinvented themselves under their real names of Ant &amp; Dec. The album featured their signature single, &quot;Shout&quot;.

During their time as primarily music artists, the pair released sixteen singles and three studio albums, with their highest UK chart position being number three. Success also struck in other European countries. The duo had a short-lived revival in the music industry, releasing a song for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, titled &quot;We&#x27;re on the Ball&quot;. The track peaked at No. 3, being beaten by Will Young and Gareth Gates. On 23 March 2013, Ant and Dec performed &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ready To Rhumble&quot; as part of their show &quot;Ant and Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway,&quot; which powered the song to number one in the UK iTunes chart and on Sunday 31 March 2013 the track was revealed as the Official UK Number 1 single on The Official Chart on BBC Radio 1. The two donated all money made from the re-release to charity.

In February 2022 the pair released the charity single &quot;We Werk Together&quot;, written by Ian Masterson, with &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race UK&quot; winners The Vivienne, Lawrence Chaney and Krystal Versace with the proceeds from the single going to the Trussell Trust. The song was performed on the first episode of the eighteenth series of &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; as the &quot;End of the Show&quot; Show, introduced by RuPaul.

===Presenting===
====Children&#x27;s television====
Ant &amp; Dec got their first presenting job in 1994 using a shortened versions of their real names, Tony &amp; Lan, while still releasing music under the alias of PJ &amp; Duncan. They co-presented a Saturday-morning children&#x27;s show entitled &quot;Gimme 5&quot;, which was broadcast on CITV. In 1995, the duo were once again offered a job on CBBC, this time presenting their own series, entitled &quot;The Ant &amp; Dec Show&quot;. The series was broadcast from 1995 to 1996, and in 1996, Ant &amp; Dec won two BAFTA Awards, one for &#x27;Best Children&#x27;s Show&#x27; and one for &#x27;Best Sketch Comedy Show&#x27;. In 1997, a VHS release, entitled &quot;The Ant &amp; Dec Show – Confidential&quot;, was made available in shops, and featured an hour of the best bits from two years of the programme, as well as specially recorded sketches and music videos.

In 1997, the duo switched to Channel 4, presenting an early-evening children&#x27;s show entitled &quot;Ant &amp; Dec Unzipped&quot;. This show also won a BAFTA but was dropped after just one series. ITV signed the duo in August 1998, and within weeks they were assigned to present ITV1&#x27;s Saturday morning programmes &quot;SMTV Live&quot; and &quot;&quot;, alongside Cat Deeley. The duo presented the shows with Deeley for three years, becoming the most popular ITV Saturday morning show. The programme&#x27;s success was the mix of games such as Eat My Goal, Wonkey Donkey and Challenge Ant, sketches such as &quot;Dec Says&quot; and the &quot;Secret of My Success&quot;, and the chemistry between Ant, Dec, and Deeley. Two SMTV VHS cassettes, compiling highlights from both shows, were released in 2000 and 2001. Ant &amp; Dec also starred in the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Engie Benjy&quot; during their time on SMTV.

Ant &amp; Dec left from children&#x27;s television in 2001 after trying out formats like &quot;Friends Like These&quot; for BBC One in 2000 and &quot;Slap Bang with Ant &amp; Dec&quot; for ITV in 2001.

====Primetime====
Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s first primetime presenting job came in the form of BBC Saturday-night game show &quot;Friends Like These&quot;, which was first broadcast in 1999. The duo presented two series of the programme between 1999 and 2001. In 2001, the duo&#x27;s contract with ITV was renewed for a further three years, following their appearances on &quot;SMTV Live&quot; and &quot;CD:UK&quot;, and they received their first primetime presenting job on the station, presenting new Saturday night reality series &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. &quot;Pop Idol&quot; was broadcast for only two series before being replaced in 2004 by &quot;The X Factor&quot;, to which former Smash Hits editor Kate Thornton was assigned presenting duties.

In 2002, Ant &amp; Dec created and presented &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;. The first series was not an overall success, but with the introduction of &quot;Ant &amp; Dec Undercover&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Next?&quot;, &quot;Ant v Dec&quot; and &quot;Little Ant and Dec&quot;, the show became a hit. During the fourth series, Dec broke his arm, thumb and suffered a concussion whilst completing a challenge for the &#x27;Ant vs. Dec&#x27; segment of the show. The incident involved learning how to ride a motorbike and jump through a fire ring. Dec failed to pull hard enough on the bike&#x27;s throttle during the challenge, causing it to topple over and sending him flying through the air. In 2006, the first episode of series five saw the duo abseil down the side of the 22-story high London Studios, where the show was filmed. Two DVDs, a best-bits book, and a board game of the series were released during 2004. The show was rested after 2009 as Ant &amp; Dec said they were running out of ideas, and it became stale, as many of the popular features such as &quot;Little Ant &amp; Dec&quot; and &quot;Undercover&quot; were dropped. &quot;Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; returned in 2013 and was a massive success; Ant &amp; Dec resurrected previous hit features such as &quot;Undercover&quot;, &quot;Little Ant and Dec&quot; (albeit with a new Little Ant and Dec) Win the Ads, and Ant v Dec, with new host Ashley Roberts. They also brought in new features such as the Supercomputer, Vegas or Bust, the End of the show &#x27;show&#x27; where Ant and Dec perform with an act such as Riverdance or an Orchestra, and &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity, get out of my ear!&quot; where they have an earpiece in a celebs ear, and they tell them what to do while being filmed by secret cameras. The series was such a success that ITV recommissioned it for 2014 even before the 2013 series ended. A board game of the format was released. The final episodes of the 2020 series were filmed at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2021 series was filmed with a virtual audience and precautions.

In August 2002, Ant &amp; Dec fronted &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. They drew their highest viewing figures to date in February 2004: nearly 15 million tuned in to watch the third series. In May 2006, they were assigned to present coverage of the charity football match &quot;Soccer Aid&quot;. They were then invited back to present coverage of the second match in September 2008 but have been replaced by Dermot O&#x27;Leary from 2010 as the match clashed with &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. In June 2006, they announced they had created a new game-show format for ITV, entitled &quot;PokerFace&quot;. The show featured members of the public gambling high stakes of money to win the ultimate prize. The first series began airing on 10 July 2006 and was aired for seven consecutive nights. The second series was broadcast in early 2007 and saw a move to a prime-time Saturday slot. Ratings for the series fell to below 3.5 million, and the series was subsequently axed in March 2007.

In 2005, as part of the ITV&#x27;s 50th birthday celebrations, they were back on television fronting &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Gameshow Marathon&quot;, a celebration of some of ITV&#x27;s most enduring gameshows from the past 50 years. They hosted &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, &quot;Family Fortunes&quot;, &quot;Play Your Cards Right&quot;, &quot;Bullseye&quot;, &quot;Take Your Pick!&quot;, &quot;The Golden Shot&quot; and &quot;Sale of the Century&quot;.

In June 2007, they were offered the job of presenters on new ITV reality platform &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; by Simon Cowell. The series features contestants aiming to win £100,000 and spot on the bill at the Royal Variety Performance while performing and being judged by Cowell, actress Amanda Holden and former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan. The series was highly successful, drawing in nearly 12 million viewers, and led to the pair continuing to operate as hosts for future series, along with continual appearances in a regular feature on the ITV2 spin-off show &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got More Talent&quot;. But, similarly to Saturday Night Takeaway, the twelfth series saw Dec present the live shows on his own (despite them both presenting the auditions shows).

The pair filmed six episodes for a new American game show, &quot;Wanna Bet?&quot;, in November 2007. The episodes were broadcast in 2008 but failed to attract enough interest for a second series to be commissioned. &quot;What You Wrote&quot;, another format created by the duo, was due to air in Autumn 2008 but was reportedly axed by ITV. In 2010, the duo debuted a replacement for &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;, entitled &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Push the Button&quot;. The series was a success, albeit not in the same way as &quot;Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;, and a second run of the programme was broadcast in 2011, but Ant and Dec later dropped the show in favour of reviving &quot;Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;.

Ant &amp; Dec have also presented the game show &quot;Red or Black?&quot;, a creation of Cowell&#x27;s, airing live on ITV in 2011 with a second series in 2012, but this was not a ratings success and was cancelled after the second series. On 24 December 2011, they presented ITV&#x27;s charity initiative &quot;Text Santa&quot; with Holly Willoughby. &quot;Text Santa&quot; returned in 2012, 2013 and 2014 with Ant &amp; Dec co-hosting alongside Christine Bleakley, Phillip Schofield, Holly Willoughby, Alesha Dixon and Paddy McGuinness.

In January 2016, Ant and Dec presented &quot;When Ant and Dec Met The Prince: 40 Years of The Prince&#x27;s Trust&quot;, a one-off documentary for ITV. In 2016, they also presented &quot;The Queen&#x27;s 90th Birthday Celebration&quot;, broadcast live on ITV.

In November 2019, &quot;Ant and Dec&#x27;s DNA Journey&quot; aired, which followed the pair as they retraced their family roots through DNA samples. In the show, they both found out that they have the same DNA marker, which means Ant and Dec are related as distant cousins. The &quot;DNA Journey&quot; format has since been done with other celebrities.

Starting from 2022, ITV aired Limitless Win, a game show with an endless jackpot. The show got renewed for a second series that started in January 2023 and was renewed for a third series later that year set to air early 2024.

===Earnings===

In 2002, Ant &amp; Dec signed a two-year golden handcuffs deal with ITV, worth £2m.

In 2004 they signed their third golden handcuffs deal with ITV, running until the end of 2007.

In April 2007, the duo signed a two-year golden handcuffs deal with ITV, reportedly worth £30–40 million, securing their career at the station until the end of 2009.

In 2009 they extended their golden handcuffs deal for two years. In 2011 they extended their golden handcuffs deal for two years.

In November 2016 the pair signed a new three-year deal with ITV, estimated to be worth £30 million over 3 years.

===Other activities===
In 2006, a celebration of the show &quot;Spitting Image&quot; saw Ant and Dec having their own puppets made. They have also been made into cartoon characters on the comedy show &quot;2DTV&quot;, and face masks in &quot;Avid Merrion&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Bo Selecta&quot;.

On 28 September 2008, news outlets reported that the pair were attacked by the Taliban whilst in Afghanistan to present a Pride of Britain Award.

In December 2008, the duo starred in their first seasonal advert in seven years, for the supermarket chain Sainsbury&#x27;s. The duo appeared alongside chef Jamie Oliver. In March 2009, the duo filmed a short film for inclusion on Comic Relief, which documents a visit to a community centre for young carers in the North East. In September 2009, the duo released their official autobiography, entitled &quot;Ooh! What a Lovely Pair. Our Story&quot;. In October 2010, the duo appeared in several Nintendo adverts playing both the Wii and Nintendo DS.
In 2011 and 2014, they both appeared on the ITV2 comedy panel show &quot;Celebrity Juice&quot;. From February 2013 to March 2015 they appeared in adverts for supermarket Morrisons. Between February 2016 and March 2018, they had appeared in adverts for car company Suzuki.

In 2014, Ant &amp; Dec designed a black and white striped Paddington Bear statue, one of fifty statues of the bear located around London prior to the release of the film &quot;Paddington&quot;, which was auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

In 2015, the pair made a cameo appearance on the U.S. adaptation of Saturday Night Takeaway, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Best Time Ever with Neil Patrick Harris&quot;. They are also executive producers on the show.

In 2020, they celebrated 30 years of working together, releasing a book titled &quot;Once Upon A Tyne&quot;. It featured stories from their time as a duo and from behind the scenes of their shows.

===OBEs===
On 10 June 2016, it was announced that the duo would be awarded OBE status by Queen Elizabeth II at an investiture later that year. The pair said they were both &quot;shocked, but incredibly honoured&quot;. McPartlin and Donnelly collected their awards for services to broadcasting and entertainment at Buckingham Palace from Prince Charles (now King Charles III) on 27 January 2017.

===Guinness World Record===
On 28 January 2020, the duo were awarded the Guinness World Record for &quot;the most National Television Awards won consecutively for Best Presenter&quot; which was at 18 as of 22 January 2019. The record has since been broken 5 times by Ant and Dec themselves after they won the same award 5 years consecutively as of 11 September 2024, bringing the new record to 23.

==Controversies==
Law firm Olswang was commissioned to investigate the 2005 British Comedy Awards when the producers overturned the voting public&#x27;s first choice, &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot; in favour of &quot;Ant and Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; for the People&#x27;s Choice Award. The incident was also the subject of an investigation by media regulator Ofcom.

Following allegations of fraud in 2007, an investigation by auditors Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu discovered that two shows, &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Gameshow Marathon&quot; and &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;, had defrauded viewers participating in phone-ins. The programmes were subject to a further investigation by Ofcom which found that between January 2003 and October 2006 &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; had:

* selected competition finalists before the telephone lines were announced as closed
* staggered the selection of competition finalists, which meant that viewers entering the competition did not have a fair and equal chance of winning
* selected finalists based on their suitability to be on television and where they lived
* selected an individual already known to the production team to be placed on the shortlist of potential winners and who went on to win the competition.

Between September and October 2005, &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Gameshow Marathon&quot; had:

* on six occasions in the Prize Mountain competition, selected winners based on their suitability to be on screen
* failed to account for almost half of the competition entries

The pair were ridiculed for their alleged participation in the fraud on the front cover of the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;.

On 30 September 2008, Ant &amp; Dec were sued for $US30 million by Greek American stand-up comedian and actor Ant for using the name &#x27;Ant&#x27; in the United States. The lawsuit, among other things, alleged trademark infringement and fraud. The suit was dismissed in May 2010. The pair have had the UK registered trademark for &#x27;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27; in the category of &#x27;Entertainment services&#x27; since 2003.

==Acting==
The pair have, albeit infrequently, returned to acting, both on stage and screen. They played themselves in the film &quot;Love Actually&quot; (in which Bill Nighy&#x27;s character addressed Dec as &quot;Ant or Dec&quot;). They have returned to their Geordie roots in a one-off tribute to &quot;The Likely Lads&quot; and also by returning to &quot;Byker Grove&quot; for Geoff&#x27;s funeral. In July 2023, it was announced that the pair would produce a reboot of &quot;Byker Grove&quot;, to simply be called &quot;Byker&quot;.

In 1998, the pair starred in the pantomime &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; at Sunderland&#x27;s Empire Theatre alongside Donnelly&#x27;s partner at the time Clare Buckfield. The show was financially unsuccessful, making £20,000 less than it cost to stage, with the duo footing a large share of the shortfall.

Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s most recent acting appearance was in the film &quot;Alien Autopsy&quot; released in April 2006. The film gained positive reviews with critics praising the pair&#x27;s acting performance but lost more than half of its budget at the box office. In 2013, they reprised their roles as P.J. and Duncan on Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway.

<doc id="464848" wikidata="Q5447451" url="?curid=464848" title="Fifteenth United States Army">
<text>The Fifteenth United States Army, commonly known as Fifteenth Army, was a field army of the United States in the European Theater of World War II. It was the last United States field army to see service in northwestern Europe during the war and was commanded by General George S. Patton until his death in December 1945. The Fifteenth Army served two separate missions while assigned to the area. During the later stages of the war its mission was the training and rehabilitation of units and acting as a defensive line against counterattacks. After World War II its mission was to carry out occupation duties and to gather historical information related to the European Theater of Operations. Fifteenth Army was inactivated at Bad Nauheim, Germany, in 1946.

==Formation==
Fifteenth Army was first activated August 21, 1944 at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, by a transfer of a group of personnel from the Fourth United States Army. No general officer was included in the transfer. Major General John P. Lucas was commanding general designate of the new Fifteenth Army in addition to his other duties. Headquarters, Fifteenth Army was then assigned to the Fourth Army.

On 18 October 1944 an advanced detachment was directed to report to the New York Port of Embarkation. From November 2, 1944 until January 2, 1945 at such time as Fifteenth Army left Ft. Sam Houston, Texas, bound for movement overseas, Colonel Louis Compton was designated commander of Fifteenth Army. From New York, on 3 November, they sailed bound for Greenock, Scotland on the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, arriving November 10, 1944. The detachment proceeded to an estate called Doddington Hall in Cheshire, England, where they were billeted with XXII Corps which later came under operational control of Fifteenth Army.

The main body of the Fifteenth Army sailed from New York aboard the &quot;Aquitania&quot; on November 15, 1944 and dropped anchor in the Firth of Clyde off Gourock, Scotland on November 22. On November 24, the temporary Fifteenth Army Headquarters began operations at Doddington Hall.

On November 25, 1944 orders were given to place Fifteenth Army under 12th Army Group. Organization continued with a command post established at Chateau d&#x27;Ardennes although the main components of the Fifteenth remained in England. As the German offensive now known as the Battle of the Bulge began, the CP was in danger and the headquarters evacuated to Cerfontaine, Belgium. The headquarters moved again on 24 December 1944 to Ferme de Suippes in France.

On December 25, 1944 the main body left Doddington Hall for a staging area in Southampton, England and boarded the British landing ship &quot;Empire Javelin&quot; the next afternoon. The Fifteenth Army headquarters consisted of 208 officers and 624 enlisted men. An additional 652 men plus the British crew were on board. Crossing the English Channel a few days later, on December 28, 1944, an explosion rocked the ship, possibly from a mine. A French frigate, &quot;L&#x27;Escarmouche,&quot; and some smaller vessels came to the rescue. &quot;L&#x27;Escarmouche&quot; was attached to the side of the &quot;Empire Javelin&quot; and many of the men jumped from the deck of the &quot;Empire Javelin&quot; to &quot;L&#x27;Escarmouche&quot;. Some men were rescued from life rafts and one life boat and some were pulled out of the water. About 10 minutes after a second explosion, the &quot;Empire Javelin&quot; sank at about 5:25 pm. Thirteen men were missing in action and 20 men were injured in this incident.

==European Theater of Operations==

Major General Ray E. Porter assumed command of the Fifteenth Army on January 2, 1945. No staff accompanied him and he directed the Acting Chief of Staff, Colonel Donegan, to retain his duties. The next day General Porter called together all section chiefs of the Fifteenth and outlined the mission of the Fifteenth and explained its assignment to Twelfth Army Group and SHAEF.

On January 16, 1945 Lieutenant General Leonard T. Gerow assumed command of the Fifteenth Army.

From mid-January 1945 until March, Fifteenth Army was charged with rehabilitating, re-equipping and training various units of the 12th Army Group that had suffered heavy losses during the Ardennes campaign. It processed all new units which arrived at northern European ports through the staging areas until their 12th Army Group assignment.

General Eisenhower assigned the Fifteenth Army to Twelfth Army Group to hold the Ruhr Pocket along the Rhine. Ninth Army and First Army were to pressure the German defenders from the north, east, and south. Eighteen days later, the First and Ninth armies met at Paderborn, with Fifteenth holding the western side of the encirclement.

On March 15, 1945 the Fifteenth Army assumed command of the forces that were bottling up the German forces left behind in the French Atlantic ports. Fifteenth Army also turned east and assumed a defensive position (using XXII Corps) on the west bank of the Rhine from Bonn moving northeast toward Hamburg.

Fifteenth Army never entered the main line of battle. However, its formations did see some action, when it contained and then reduced the enormous Ruhr Pocket from the west during April 1945 in conjunction with elements of Ninth Army. This resulted in the capture of 325,000 German prisoners. Fifteenth Army would take over occupation duties in the region as Ninth Army and First Army pushed farther into Germany.

In April 1945 the Fifteenth Army crossed the Rhine, 2–3 weeks behind the other Allied Field Armies. It took over responsibility for the Hesse, Saarland, Pfalz, and Rhine provinces, where it processed Axis POWs, Disarmed Enemy Forces and Displaced Persons.

After V-E Day, Fifteenth Army&#x27;s task was to organize the Theater General Board whose purpose was to study, analyze and document past operations in the European Theater. Some intelligence gathering interviews were also conducted by divisions of the Fifteenth Army.

==Military occupation of Germany==

The Fifteenth Army was originally intended to command occupation forces in the Rhine Province, Saarland, Palatinate (Pfalz), and part of Hesse, areas now primarily parts of the German states of North Rhine-Westphalia, the Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland. However, in the summer of 1945, the occupation mission in this sector was assumed in the north by the British Army and in the south by the French Army.

Subsequently, the Fifteenth Army consisted solely of a small staff quartered at Bad Nauheim in the interior of Germany. It consisted of a headquarters and special troops assigned to gather historical data on Allied operations during the war. The Fifteenth Army was headquartered at Bad Neuenahr (within walking distance to Ahrweiler) beginning in late May 1945, according to the diary of one of the soldiers. The men would walk to Ahrweiler during their free time.

During the Occupation, on May 2, 1945 the Fifteenth Army received for safekeeping the Holy Crown of St. Stephen of Hungary. It was transferred for storage at Fort Knox, Kentucky and returned to the Hungarian Government 5 January 1978.

General Gerow remained in command of Fifteenth Army until he was succeeded by General George S. Patton who was appointed Commander, Fifteenth United States Army, and President of the European Theater General Board on 14 October 1945. This appointment was a transfer from Third United States Army. The move took away much of the power Patton had in Bavaria in post-War Germany while attempting to maintain some respect for his accomplishments in the war. By this point the Fifteenth was a small organization concerned with documentation of tactical lessons to be learned from the war. Patton was unhappy with the transfer from Third Army but told friends the transfer was in line with what was his favorite mental occupation since he was seven years old: the study of war.

Coincidentally, 1st Lieutenant John Eisenhower, son of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, had only recently (September, 1945) been assigned to Fifteenth Army. In his book &quot;General Ike: A Personal Reminiscence&quot; he writes that one day in October 1945 &#x27;Ike&#x27; told him &quot;I had to fire George Patton today.&quot; John Eisenhower then served under Patton for a short time.

==Death of Patton==

Continuing as commander of Fifteenth Army, in November 1945 Patton replaced General Eisenhower as commander of U.S. Forces in Europe when Eisenhower was reassigned as Army Chief of Staff. Patton was very conflicted during this time, and even considered resigning from the Army (instead of retiring, which would leave him still subject to Army regulations). Saying that a hunting trip might be a good outing to take his mind off his present difficulties, he set out by car on December 8 to go pheasant hunting. On the way General Patton&#x27;s staff car was involved in a collision and he died from his injuries on December 21.

Major General Hobart R. Gay became commander of the Fifteenth Army in January 1946. Gay had been Chief of Staff of Third U.S. Army from February 1944 to October 1945, and then Chief of Staff of Fifteenth Army. He remained commander of Fifteenth Army for only about a month, becoming commander of the 1st Armored Division in February 1946.

==Inactivation==
Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Fifteenth Army, was inactivated on January 31, 1946, at Bad Nauheim, Germany.

<text>Declan Joseph Oliver Donnelly (born 25 September 1975) is a British television presenter, television producer, former singer, rapper, comedian and actor. He is best known for working alongside Ant McPartlin as part of the presenting duo Ant &amp; Dec.

Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, Donnelly came to prominence, alongside McPartlin, in the children&#x27;s drama series &quot;Byker Grove&quot;, with both men establishing successful careers as television presenters, in which they are most known for presenting &quot;SMTV Live&quot; (between 1998 and 2001), &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; alongside Ant McPartlin (2002–2017, 2019–) and Holly Willoughby (2018) and &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; (2002–2024), and &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; (since 2007).

Other notable highlights of Donnelly&#x27;s career alongside McPartlin include presenting &quot;PokerFace&quot;, &quot;Push the Button&quot;, &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, and &quot;Red or Black?&quot;, being hosts of charity appeal &quot;Text Santa&quot; (between 2011 and 2014), and also performing as pop music duo PJ &amp; Duncan.

==Early life==
Donnelly is the child of parents Alphonsus Donnelly and Anne Donnelly, who originally resided in Desertmartin, Northern Ireland before moving to England in the 1950s, settling in Newcastle upon Tyne. He is among seven children the couple raised within the council estate of Cruddas Park.

Donnelly&#x27;s education took place first at St Michael&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School, and later at the all-boys St Cuthbert&#x27;s High School, with him receiving 8 GCSEs. Although he eventually moved towards a career in television, he originally considered becoming a Catholic priest but changed his mind upon seeing the students from the all-girls Sacred Heart Catholic High School.

==Career==

Donnelly&#x27;s career in television began at the age of 12, when his father suggested that he audition for &quot;Byker Grove&quot;, a new children&#x27;s television programme being created by CBBC in Newcastle upon Tyne that had been advertised in local newspapers. His success in this audition led to him securing the role of Duncan, whereupon he first met Anthony McPartlin. Although he was raised in an estate close to Donnelly, McPartlin had never met him until their involvement in the children&#x27;s drama. The pair worked together on the show until their eventual departure in 1993, whereupon they began to bond as friends, both socially and professionally.

After a short tenure in music, Donnelly and McPartlin furthered their careers in television by becoming the presenting duo Ant &amp; Dec. Having already fronted Children&#x27;s TV show &#x27;The Ant and Dec show&#x27; on BBC1, which ran for 2 series, followed by a stint on Channel 4 with the edgier &#x27;Ant &amp; Dec Unzipped&#x27;, The pair continued to work in children&#x27;s television, fronting ITV&#x27;s Saturday morning children&#x27;s programme &quot;SMTV Live&quot;. After leaving the programme in 2001, the pair branched out to front other shows, including game shows – &quot;Friends Like These&quot;, &quot;PokerFace&quot; and &quot;Push the Button&quot; – talent shows – &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, and &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; – and entertainment programmes – &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, and &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;. The pair continued to maintain acting careers, starring in a tribute to &quot;The Likely Lads&quot; in 2002, in the form of a remake of an episode from the show&#x27;s sequel &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot;, entitled &quot;No Hiding Place&quot;, and in 2006 film &quot;Alien Autopsy&quot;.

Ant &amp; Dec have their own production company Mitre Television where they produce their shows.

==Personal life==

On 22 July 2006, Donnelly was the best man for McPartlin&#x27;s wedding to Lisa Armstrong.

Donnelly reprised his role as McPartlin&#x27;s best man when he married his new wife, Anne-Marie Corbett on 7 August 2021. In an &#x27;emotional&#x27; speech on the special day, he described McPartlin as the &quot;best friend a man could have&quot; before reading a prayer in front of the guests attending.

In August 2011, Donnelly attended his father&#x27;s funeral, after Alphonsus died in hospital of cancer.

Donnelly dated actress Clare Buckfield for ten years between 1993 and 2003, and television presenter Georgie Thompson from January 2009 until April 2011.

On 13 November 2014, Donnelly became engaged to the duo&#x27;s manager, Ali Astall, with whom he had been in a relationship for over a year, with the marriage taking place at St Michael&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Elswick, Tyne and Wear, on 1 August 2015. The ceremony was conducted by his brother, Father Dermott Donnelly, a Catholic priest, with McPartlin as his best man. On 1 September 2018, after announcing earlier in the year that the couple were expecting their first child, Donnelly&#x27;s wife gave birth to their daughter, Isla.

On 19 March 2018, after his colleague McPartlin&#x27;s car crash, it was announced that Donnelly would be presenting the remaining episodes of &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; and the live semi-finals of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; on his own.

In November 2019, it was revealed that Dec is a distant cousin of the American professional wrestling promoter and businesswoman Dixie Carter. He is also related to footballer Aaron Donnelly. His elder brother Dermott died after a short illness on 8 July 2022 at age 55.

Donnelly has stated that he is a practising Roman Catholic but does not publicly discuss religion or his family in depth.

On 23 July 2022, Donnelly and Astall welcomed their second child, a boy, Jack. In a &#x27;sweet&#x27; gesture, the couple gave their son middle names &#x27;Anthony&#x27; and &#x27;Alphonsus&#x27; in honour of Donnelly&#x27;s best friend McPartlin and late father respectively.

==Charity==
Donnelly and McPartlin are patrons of the charity Sunshine Fund. When their single &#x27;Let&#x27;s Get Ready to Rhumble&#x27; reached No.1 in 2012, Ant &amp; Dec donated the single&#x27;s success to the charity ChildLine. They also support the Text Santa appeal.

Donnelly also supports the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle&#x27;s Youth Ministry Team, directed by one of his older brothers, Dermott Donnelly, former dean of St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Newcastle. They opened the W4 Youth Centre in 2013.

==Earnings==

In 2002, Ant &amp; Dec signed a two-year golden handcuffs deal with ITV, worth £2m.

In 2004 they signed their third golden handcuffs deal with ITV, running until the end of 2007.

In April 2007, the duo signed a two-year golden handcuffs deal with ITV, reportedly worth £30–40 million, securing their career at the station until the end of 2009.

In 2009 they extended their golden handcuffs deal for two years. In 2011 they extended their golden handcuffs deal for two years.

In November 2016 the pair signed a new three-year deal with ITV, estimated to be worth £30 million over 3 years.

<text>Historic Crew Stadium, previously known as Columbus Crew Stadium and Mapfre Stadium, is a soccer-specific stadium in Columbus, Ohio, United States. It primarily served as the home stadium of the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer from 1999 until 2021, when the team moved to Lower.com Field. Historic Crew Stadium is the current home of the Crew&#x27;s training facility, the OhioHealth Performance Center and MLS Next Pro team Columbus Crew 2. Historic Crew Stadium is also the site of a variety of additional events in amateur and professional soccer, American football, lacrosse, and rugby, and is a regular site for outdoor concerts due to the permanent stage in the north end zone.

Built in 1999, it was the first soccer-specific stadium built by a Major League Soccer team, starting an important trend in MLS stadium construction. The stadium was named for Madrid-based Mapfre Insurance after the company signed a 5-year sponsorship agreement announced on March 3, 2015. In December 2020, the deal expired and the Crew renamed the stadium. The listed seating capacity is 19,968. In 2015, Mapfre Stadium and Director of Grounds Weston Appelfeller were honored with the prestigious Field of the Year award by the Sports Turf Managers Association (STMA) for the professional soccer division.

==History==
The Crew played their first three seasons at Ohio Stadium on the campus of the Ohio State University. During games, large sections of the stadium were blocked off to reduce capacity from approximately 90,000 to 25,243. Although the Crew enjoyed success at Ohio Stadium during their tenure there, the large seating capacity and limitations to the field size made the stadium ill-suited for soccer. Additionally, Ohio Stadium then required rented lights for night matches. These problems, along with planned renovations to Ohio Stadium, which began in 1999, were all factors in the development of Historic Crew Stadium. The construction cost of US$28.5 million was covered entirely with private funds from Crew owner and oil billionaire Lamar Hunt and his Hunt Sports group. It is located on the grounds of the Ohio Expo Center and State Fairgrounds, between East 17th Avenue and East Hudson Street. The site was previously home to Columbus Auto Parts, an OEM factory supplying the automobile industry, which stood vacant for decades between the Conrail railroad tracks and Interstate 71 before its demolition in the &#x27;90s.

Historic Crew Stadium opened on May 15, 1999, as Columbus Crew Stadium with a match between the home side and the New England Revolution. It is the second soccer-specific stadium built in the country, after Steel Athletic Field was built in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 1913, and the first Major League Soccer stadium constructed in the United States. It has been credited with inspiring the wave of construction of soccer-specific stadiums throughout the league. In the 2010 Showcase issue of &quot;Stadia Magazine&quot;, Ian Nuttall stated &quot;Who&#x27;d have thought when it opened in 1999 that Major League Soccer&#x27;s first purpose-built stadium would kick-start the wave of dedicated soccer-specific stadiums that continue today?&quot; The seating capacity was originally 22,555 until 2008 when construction of a permanent stage in the north end zone reduced seating capacity to 20,455, with room to expand to 30,000 total seats for concerts. as of 2023, the seating capacity for a soccer game is 19,968.

After nearly 15 years of the stadium not having a corporate sponsor, the Crew announced naming rights were sold to Madrid-based insurance company Mapfre on March 3, 2015. The team had been searching to sell stadium naming rights since it opened in 1999, but had been unable to come to an agreement.

==Events==
In addition to hosting the Crew home games, Historic Crew Stadium has also hosted other Major League Soccer and professional soccer events. It was the site of the 2001 MLS Cup championship and was the host stadium for the Major League Soccer All-Star Game in 2000 and 2005. The stadium also hosted the U.S. Open Cup final on two occasions, in 1999 and 2002.

Both the United States men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national teams have played numerous matches at Historic Crew Stadium, most notably, the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifier in February 2001 between the U.S. and Mexico known as &quot;La Guerra Fria&quot; (The Cold War) due to sub-freezing temperatures. During the 2003 Women&#x27;s World Cup, the stadium was one of the venues used during the group stage of the tournament. In 2018, Mapfre Stadium was one of three sites selected to host the SheBelieves Cup.

Historic Crew Stadium has also hosted events outside of professional soccer. The NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Soccer Championship was held at Crew Stadium in 2001 and 2003. In 2002, it hosted the Steinfeld Cup, the championship game of Major League Lacrosse. In June 2010, Historic Crew Stadium hosted the inaugural USA Sevens Rugby Collegiate Championship Invitational.

The venue was a regular site for Ohio High School Athletic Association state championship tournaments in soccer. In the local Columbus area, it is the site for the annual Westerville Football Classic, featuring the Westerville Central, Westerville North, Westerville South, and New Albany football teams. It has also been host to the local high school football rivalry of parochial schools Bishop Watterson High School and St. Francis DeSales High School.

==International soccer==

===2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup===
The 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup was played in the United States. Historic Crew Stadium hosted several group game matches.

===U.S. women&#x27;s national soccer team===

===U.S. men&#x27;s national soccer team===
Since the opening of Historic Crew Stadium, it has been a regular site for the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team matches, hosting ten games through 2013. The men&#x27;s national team held an unbeaten record of 8–3–0 in all competitions, outscoring opponents 19–1. This was until the U.S. was beaten by Mexico on Veterans Day 2016.

The stadium has hosted five consecutive World Cup qualifying matches against Mexico, with the U.S. winning four of the five matches by the same score of 2–0 (with the U.S. fans adopting the rallying cry of &quot;dos-a-cero&quot;).

The national team was beaten by Mexico on November 11, 2016, by a score of 1–2, prompting Mexico&#x27;s first ever win in Columbus, and the U.S.&#x27;s first World Cup qualifying defeat on home soil in 15 years. It hosted a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Guatemala on March 29, 2016, which the US won, 4–0.

==MLS Cup Finals==
Since the opening of Historic Crew Stadium, it has hosted three MLS Cup Finals, once as a neutral site, and twice as Columbus Crew played host. The latter two occurred following a 2012 MLS rules change which did away with a neutral site for the Final, and instead has the club with the best overall regular-season record hosting the match.

==Concerts==
The stadium hosts numerous concerts annually, most notably Rock on the Range, an annual festival of performances by rock bands that was held from 2007 to 2018, and replaced by Sonic Temple Art &amp; Music Festival in 2019. Concerts by Rascal Flatts also closed out the Ohio State Fair in 2006, 2007, and 2009. A permanent stage, built in 2008, was constructed in the north end of the stadium to accommodate concerts after the closing of Germain Amphitheater. The addition replaced about 2,100 seats in the north end.

==Post-Crew==

As part of the new ownership proposal for the Crew unveiled in 2018, the club announced plans to build a new stadium, eventually known as Lower.com Field, west of the Arena District near Downtown Columbus. At the time of the proposal, the new stadium would seat 20,000 spectators and include 30 suites and 1,900 club seats. Construction on the new stadium began in October 2019. With the new stadium having opened on July 3, 2021, Historic Crew Stadium was to be redeveloped into the Crew&#x27;s training center and community sports park, as well as a concert venue. The OhioHealth Performance Center training facility opened in June 2021, but the stadium still remains.

In 2020, a new authority will own Historic Crew Stadium and its adjacent city sports park, with the team continuing to control the stadium in terms of its use as a practice facility and their second-level team. The Crew played their final game at Historic Crew Stadium against the Chicago Fire FC, winning 2–0.

Starting in the 2022 season, the Crew&#x27;s second-level squad, Columbus Crew 2, play in the stadium, with the first game on April 15, 2022, against Orlando City B.

<doc id="464865" wikidata="Q233110" url="?curid=464865" title="Non-convergent discourse">
<text>A non-convergent discourse (NCD) is a discourse in which the participants do not converge in their language, which results in the use of different languages. Alternative names for this phenomenon are asymmetric and bilingual discourse.

The term was introduced by the sociologist Reitze Jonkman. He distinguishes two motivations for people to engage in an NCD:

*Insufficient active knowledge of the other participants&#x27; language, combined with a good passive knowledge. It usually takes longer for a person learning a foreign language to speak it fluently than to understand it when it is being spoken. This type of NCD is common in areas of the world where closely-related languages or dialects are spoken, but which are not individually widespread to be commonly taught to outsiders. Such examples include the North Germanic languages of Scandinavia; Dutch and Afrikaans; Romance languages such as Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and regional languages of Spain and Italy; various Slavic languages within each Slavic branch; Indo-Aryan languages; Dravidian languages, and more. In some areas where bilingualism is common, this can also be done with languages that are not mutually intelligible if both speakers are assumed to understand the other&#x27;s language, as is the case in cities like Montreal, as well as of course between two individual speakers of mutually unintelligible languages (which can even include married couples) who know that the other has a good passive knowledge of their own language but poor active command.

*Ethnic marking: the use of a preferred variety, in order to stress one&#x27;s belonging to a certain cultural or ethnic group. This occurs in Northern Germany, for example, where speakers of Low German and standard German do not converge.

*A third motivation for engaging in an NCD lies on the personal level. According to Giles&#x27; Communication Accommodation Theory, interpersonal contacts are negotiations. In a discourse, people seek to create understanding by stressing common features. However, when this will for creating understanding is not present (for example, in cases where the participants feel a strong dislike for each other), they dissociate from each other by stressing the differences. The use of different languages might be the result of such a dissociation strategy. In other contexts, though, NCD may actually imply informality and trust rather than distance.

Sometimes the motivation for engaging in an NCD is misunderstood, especially in contexts where they are uncommon. NCD participants with an ethnic marking strategy might be wrongly interpreted as if they were expressing dislike. This type of misunderstanding is especially common among speakers who come from monolingual areas and find themselves in a bilingual area, where a second language is used alongside their own and NCDs are common.

<text>Orono is a community in the Municipality of Clarington, Ontario, Canada. It is located on the southern stretch of Highway 35/115, approximately east of Toronto.

==History==
The town was founded in 1832. A post office was opened at Orono in July 1852 (postmaster: Joseph Tucker), when the village contained about 200 residents, and was named after Orono, Maine since the landscape seemed similar. The name for the post office is said to have been selected in 1852 when a visitor from Maine suggested Orono— the name of a town near Bangor, Maine. Declared a police village in 1854, the village remained small but vibrant. Significant to the village&#x27;s growth in the opening decades of the twentieth century was the arrival of the Canadian Northern Railway in 1911. Farming was, and remains, an important economic activity in the area. Many motorists stopped in the town on their way from Lindsay to Newcastle before the 35/115 was built. The population is approximately 1800.

The Municipality of Clarington, in which Orono is located, was formed through the union of the Townships of Clarke and Darlington. Historically, Orono was the seat of government for Clarke Township. Now Clarington&#x27;s fourth largest urban community, Orono is attractive to those who prefer a quiet, more rural lifestyle. The downtown consists of several small shops and a central town hall that are typical of villages throughout Ontario and the northern United States.

Most of Orono&#x27;s youth residents who attend Orono public school move onto The Pines and Clarke High School, located just off the Highway 115 on the border of Newcastle; both are among the oldest active Middle and Secondary schools in the area.

The Clarke Raiders, who are the local high school hockey team, are one of the best in the district. The team boasts AAA players, and players from the local clubs of Newcastle and Orono.

The Orono Leafs, the local CC hockey club, began in the late 1990s, and still have a popular program that is successful.

==Tourism==

Orono is the locale for several yearly events in Clarington: the Orono Fair hosted by the Orono Agricultural Society the first weekend after Labour Day every year. The fair draws nearly 30,000 annually to celebrate the area&#x27;s agricultural roots and features equestrian events, Livestock shows, School and Children&#x27;s exhibits, Agricultural Education, Art Show Competition, Pie and Cake Auction, Woodworking, Cooking Demonstrations, Live Entertainment, Truck and Tractor Pulls, Horse Pulls, Demolition Derby and much more.

There were previously 4 antique stores in the downtown core of the village, which caused Orono become an antiquing Mecca, drawing people from far and wide to shop for antique and vintage treasures.

Notable landmarks include:
*Orono Country Cafe
*Jungle Cat World
*Orono Fairgrounds
*Orono Masonic Lodge - Orono No. 325
*The Apple Blossom Shop
*The Trillium Morgan Horse Farm
*Ray&#x27;s Barber Shop
*Orono Community Centre (Hockey Rink)
*Mosque Masjid Alwadood
*Terrens Wellness Centre
*Orono Antique Market (located in the old Orono Armoury)
*Main Thru Church Antique Mall

Producing millions of evergreen seedlings annually for restoring Ontario&#x27;s forests, the &quot;Orono Forestry Station&quot; (founded in 1922) was a prominent feature in the town until it closed down in 1996. The trails that snake throughout the station are walked daily be residents and geocachers alike.

At the centre of the village, residents and tourists enjoy the Sydney B. Rutherford Woods Walk Park, one of the many wooded areas in the village. Orono is surrounded by several pastoral hamlets, such as Kirby, Kendal, Newtonville, Leskard, Starkville; and larger towns like Newcastle and Bowmanville.

Despite its size, Orono boasts a popular zoo called Jungle Cat World, located on the north side of Orono, as well as the Orono Fair which draw people from miles around.

The nearby Brimacombe (Oshawa Ski Club), locally known as the Kirby Ski Hill, is a popular winter attraction, and has a dramatic landscape view of the Oak Ridges Moraine&#x27;s rolling hills and farmlands at the top of the hill in the Summer season. The ski hill boasts 4 chairs, and one T-Bar. The club also provides 8 green runs, 6 blue runs, 8 black runs and two terrain parks for the paying public to use. There is also a summer camp after the skiing season.

<text>Information management (IM) is the appropriate and optimized capture, storage, retrieval, and use of information. It may be personal information management or organizational. Information management for organizations concerns a cycle of organizational activity: the acquisition of information from one or more sources, the custodianship and the distribution of that information to those who need it, and its ultimate disposal through archiving or deletion and extraction.

This cycle of information organisation involves a variety of stakeholders, including those who are responsible for assuring the quality, accessibility and utility of acquired information; those who are responsible for its safe storage and disposal; and those who need it for decision making. Stakeholders might have rights to originate, change, distribute or delete information according to organisational information management policies.

Information management embraces all the generic concepts of management, including the planning, organizing, structuring, processing, controlling, evaluation and reporting of information activities, all of which is needed in order to meet the needs of those with organisational roles or functions that depend on information. These generic concepts allow the information to be presented to the audience or the correct group of people. After individuals are able to put that information to use, it then gains more value.

Information management is closely related to, and overlaps with, the management of data, systems, technology, processes and – where the availability of information is critical to organisational success – strategy. This broad view of the realm of information management contrasts with the earlier, more traditional view, that the life cycle of managing information is an operational matter that requires specific procedures, organisational capabilities and standards that deal with information as a product or a service.

==History==

===Emergent ideas out of data management===
In the 1970s, the management of information largely concerned matters closer to what would now be called data management: punched cards, magnetic tapes and other record-keeping media, involving a life cycle of such formats requiring origination, distribution, backup, maintenance and disposal. At this time the huge potential of information technology began to be recognised: for example a single chip storing a whole book, or electronic mail moving messages instantly around the world, remarkable ideas at the time. With the proliferation of information technology and the extending reach of information systems in the 1980s and 1990s, information management took on a new form. Progressive businesses such as BP transformed the vocabulary of what was then &quot;IT management&quot;, so that &quot;systems analysts&quot; became &quot;business analysts&quot;, &quot;monopoly supply&quot; became a mixture of &quot;insourcing&quot; and &quot;outsourcing&quot;, and the large IT function was transformed into &quot;lean teams&quot; that began to allow some agility in the processes that harness information for business benefit. The scope of senior management interest in information at BP extended from the creation of value through improved business processes, based upon the effective management of information, permitting the implementation of appropriate information systems (or &quot;applications&quot;) that were operated on IT infrastructure that was outsourced. In this way, information management was no longer a simple job that could be performed by anyone who had nothing else to do, it became highly strategic and a matter for senior management attention. An understanding of the technologies involved, an ability to manage information systems projects and business change well, and a willingness to align technology and business strategies all became necessary.

===Positioning information management in the bigger picture===
In the transitional period leading up to the strategic view of information management, Venkatraman, a strong advocate of this transition and transformation, proffered a simple arrangement of ideas that succinctly brought together the management of data, information, and knowledge (see the figure) argued that:

* Data that is maintained in IT infrastructure has to be &quot;interpreted&quot; in order to render information.
* The information in our information systems has to be &quot;understood&quot; in order to emerge as knowledge.
* Knowledge allows managers to &quot;take effective decisions&quot;.
* Effective decisions have to lead to &quot;appropriate actions&quot;. 
* Appropriate actions are expected to deliver &quot;meaningful results&quot;.
This is often referred to as the DIKAR model: Data, Information, Knowledge, Action and Result, it gives a strong clue as to the layers involved in aligning technology and organisational strategies, and it can be seen as a pivotal moment in changing attitudes to information management. The recognition that information management is an investment that must deliver meaningful results is important to all modern organisations that depend on information and good decision-making for their success.

==Theoretical background==

===Behavioural and organisational theories===
It is commonly believed that good information management is crucial to the smooth working of organisations, and although there is no commonly accepted theory of information management &quot;per se&quot;, behavioural and organisational theories help. Following the behavioural science theory of management, mainly developed at Carnegie Mellon University and prominently supported by March and Simon, most of what goes on in modern organizations is actually information handling and decision making. One crucial factor in information handling and decision making is an individual&#x27;s ability to process information and to make decisions under limitations that might derive from the context: a person&#x27;s age, the situational complexity, or a lack of requisite quality in the information that is at hand – all of which is exacerbated by the rapid advance of technology and the new kinds of system that it enables, especially as the social web emerges as a phenomenon that business cannot ignore. And yet, well before there was any general recognition of the importance of information management in organisations, March and Simon argued that organizations have to be considered as cooperative systems, with a high level of information processing and a vast need for decision making at various levels. Instead of using the model of the &quot;economic man&quot;, as advocated in classical theory they proposed &quot;administrative man&quot; as an alternative, based on their argumentation about the cognitive limits of rationality. Additionally they proposed the notion of satisficing, which entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met - another idea that still has currency.

===Economic theory===
In addition to the organisational factors mentioned by March and Simon, there are other issues that stem from economic and environmental dynamics. There is the cost of collecting and evaluating the information needed to take a decision, including the time and effort required. The transaction cost associated with information processes can be high. In particular, established organizational rules and procedures can prevent the taking of the most appropriate decision, leading to sub-optimum outcomes. This is an issue that has been presented as a major problem with bureaucratic organizations that lose the economies of strategic change because of entrenched attitudes.

==Strategic information management==

===Background===
According to the Carnegie Mellon School an organization&#x27;s ability to process information is at the core of organizational and managerial competency, and an organization&#x27;s strategies must be designed to improve information processing capability and as information systems that provide that capability became formalised and automated, competencies were severely tested at many levels. It was recognised that organisations needed to be able to learn and adapt in ways that were never so evident before and academics began to organise and publish definitive works concerning the strategic management of information, and information systems. Concurrently, the ideas of business process management and knowledge management although much of the optimistic early thinking about business process redesign has since been discredited in the information management literature. In the strategic studies field, it is considered of the highest priority the understanding of the information environment, conceived as the aggregate of individuals, organizations, and systems that collect, process, disseminate, or act on information. This environment consists of three interrelated dimensions which continuously interact with individuals, organizations, and systems. These dimensions are the physical, informational, and cognitive.

===Aligning technology and business strategy with information management===

Venkatraman has provided a simple view of the requisite capabilities of an organisation that wants to manage information well – the DIKAR model (see above). He also worked with others to understand how technology and business strategies could be appropriately aligned in order to identify specific capabilities that are needed. This work was paralleled by other writers in the world of consulting, practice, and academia.

===A contemporary portfolio model for information===
Bytheway has collected and organised basic tools and techniques for information management in a single volume. At the heart of his view of information management is a portfolio model that takes account of the surging interest in external sources of information and the need to organise un-structured information external so as to make it useful (see the figure).

Such an information portfolio as this shows how information can be gathered and usefully organised, in four stages:

Stage 1: Taking advantage of public information: recognise and adopt well-structured external schemes of reference data, such as post codes, weather data, GPS positioning data and travel timetables, exemplified in the personal computing press.

Stage 2: Tagging the noise on the World Wide Web: use existing schemes such as post codes and GPS data or more typically by adding “tags”, or construct a formal ontology that provides structure. Shirky provides an overview of these two approaches.

Stage 3: Sifting and analysing: in the wider world the generalised ontologies that are under development extend to hundreds of entities and hundreds of relations between them and provide the means to elicit meaning from large volumes of data. Structured data in databases works best when that structure reflects a higher-level information model – an ontology, or an entity-relationship model.

Stage 4: Structuring and archiving: with the large volume of data available from sources such as the social web and from the miniature telemetry systems used in personal health management, new ways to archive and then trawl data for meaningful information. Map-reduce methods, originating from functional programming, are a more recent way of eliciting information from large archival datasets that is becoming interesting to regular businesses that have very large data resources to work with, but it requires advanced multi-processor resources.

===Competencies to manage information well===
In 2004, the management system &quot;Information Management Body of Knowledge&quot; was first published on the World Wide Web 
and set out to show that the required management competencies to derive real benefits from an investment in information are complex and multi-layered. The framework model that is the basis for understanding competencies comprises six &quot;knowledge&quot; areas and four &quot;process&quot; areas:
;The information management knowledge areas
The IMBOK is based on the argument that there are six areas of required management competency, two of which (&quot;business process management&quot; and &quot;business information management&quot;) are very closely related.

* Information technology: The pace of change of technology and the pressure to constantly acquire the newest technological products can undermine the stability of the infrastructure that supports systems, and thereby optimises business processes and delivers benefits. It is necessary to manage the &quot;supply side&quot; and recognise that technology is, increasingly, becoming a commodity.
* Information system: While historically information systems were developed in-house, over the years it has become possible to acquire most of the software systems that an organisation needs from the software package industry. However, there is still the potential for competitive advantage from the implementation of new systems ideas that deliver to the strategic intentions of organisations.
* Business processes and Business information: Information systems are applied to business processes in order to improve them, and they bring data to the business that becomes useful as business information. Business process management is still seen as a relatively new idea because it is not universally adopted, and it has been difficult in many cases; business &quot;information&quot; management is even more of a challenge.
* Business benefit: What are the benefits that we are seeking? It is necessary not only to be brutally honest about what &quot;can&quot; be achieved, but also to ensure the active management and assessment of benefit delivery. Since the emergence and popularisation of the Balanced scorecard there has been huge interest in business performance management but not much serious effort has been made to relate business performance management to the benefits of information technology investments and the introduction of new information systems until the turn of the millennium.
* Business strategy: Although a long way from the workaday issues of managing information in organisations, strategy in most organisations simply has to be informed by information technology and information systems opportunities, whether to address poor performance or to improve differentiation and competitiveness. Strategic analysis tools such as the value chain and critical success factor analysis are directly dependent on proper attention to the information that is (or could be) managed 

;The information management processes
Even with full capability and competency within the six knowledge areas, it is argued that things can still go wrong. The problem lies in the migration of ideas and information management value from one area of competency to another. Summarising what Bytheway explains in some detail (and supported by selected secondary references):

* Projects: Information technology is without value until it is engineered into information systems that meet the needs of the business by means of good project management.
* Business change: The best information systems succeed in delivering benefits through the achievement of change within the business systems, but people do not appreciate change that makes new demands upon their skills in the ways that new information systems often do. Contrary to common expectations, there is some evidence that the public sector has succeeded with information technology induced business change.
* Business operations: With new systems in place, with business processes and business information improved, and with staff finally ready and able to work with new processes, then the business can get to work, even when new systems extend far beyond the boundaries of a single business.
* Performance management: Investments are no longer solely about financial results, financial success must be balanced with internal efficiency, customer satisfaction, and with organisational learning and development.

===Summary===
There are always many ways to see a business, and the information management viewpoint is only one way. Other areas of business activity will also contribute to strategy – it is not only good information management that moves a business forwards. Corporate governance, human resource management, product development and marketing will all have an important role to play in strategic ways, and we must not see one domain of activity alone as the sole source of strategic success. On the other hand, corporate governance, human resource management, product development and marketing are all dependent on effective information management, and so in the final analysis our competency to manage information well, on the broad basis that is offered here, can be said to be predominant.

==Operationalising information management==

===Managing requisite change===
Organizations are often confronted with many information management challenges and issues at the operational level, especially when organisational change is engendered. The novelty of new systems architectures and a lack of experience with new styles of information management requires a level of organisational change management that is notoriously difficult to deliver. As a result of a general organisational reluctance to change, to enable new forms of information management, there might be (for example): a shortfall in the requisite resources, a failure to acknowledge new classes of information and the new procedures that use them, a lack of support from senior management leading to a loss of strategic vision, and even political manoeuvring that undermines the operation of the whole organisation. However, the implementation of new forms of information management should normally lead to operational benefits.

===Galbraith&#x27;s early work===
In early work, taking an information processing view of organisation design, Jay Galbraith has identified five tactical areas to increase information processing capacity and reduce the need for information processing.

* Developing, implementing, and monitoring all aspects of the &quot;environment&quot; of an organization.
* Creation of slack resources so as to decrease the load on the overall hierarchy of resources and to reduce information processing relating to overload.
* Creation of self-contained tasks with defined boundaries and that can achieve proper closure, and with all the resources at hand required to perform the task.
* Recognition of lateral relations that cut across functional units, so as to move decision power to the process instead of fragmenting it within the hierarchy.
* Investment in vertical information systems that route information flows for a specific task (or set of tasks) in accordance to the applied business logic.

===Matrix organisation===
The lateral relations concept leads to an organizational form that is different from the simple hierarchy, the &quot;matrix organization&quot;. This brings together the vertical (hierarchical) view of an organisation and the horizontal (product or project) view of the work that it does visible to the outside world. The creation of a matrix organization is one management response to a persistent fluidity of external demand, avoiding multifarious and spurious responses to episodic demands that tend to be dealt with individually.

<doc id="464879" wikidata="Q1275904" url="?curid=464879" title="Neolithic Europe">
<text>The European Neolithic is the period from the arrival of Neolithic (New Stone Age) technology and the associated population of Early European Farmers in Europe, (the approximate time of the first farming societies in Greece) until –1700 BC (the beginning of Bronze Age Europe with the Nordic Bronze Age). The Neolithic overlaps the Mesolithic and Bronze Age periods in Europe as cultural changes moved from the southeast to northwest at about 1 km/year – this is called the Neolithic Expansion.

The duration of the Neolithic varies from place to place, its end marked by the introduction of bronze tools: in southeast Europe it is approximately 4,000 years (i.e. 7000 BC–3000 BC) while in parts of Northwest Europe it is just under 3,000 years (–1700 BC). In parts of Europe, notably the Balkans, the period after is known as the Chalcolithic (Copper Age) due to the invention of copper smelting and the prevalence of copper tools, weapons and other artifacts.

The spread of the Neolithic from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic in the Near East to Europe was first studied quantitatively in the 1970s, when a sufficient number of 14C age determinations for early Neolithic sites had become available. Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza discovered a linear relationship between the age of an Early Neolithic site and its distance from the conventional source in the Near East (Jericho), thus demonstrating that the Neolithic spread at an average speed of about 1 km/yr. More recent studies confirm these results and yield a speed of 0.6–1.3 km/yr at a 95% confidence level.

==Basic cultural characteristics==

Regardless of specific chronology, many European Neolithic groups share basic characteristics, such as living in small-scale, family-based communities, subsisting on domesticated plants and animals supplemented with the collection of wild plant foods and with hunting, and producing hand-made pottery, that is, pottery made without the potter&#x27;s wheel. Polished stone axes lie at the heart of the neolithic (new stone) culture, enabling forest clearance for agriculture and production of wood for dwellings, as well as fuel.
There are also many differences, with some Neolithic communities in southeastern Europe living in heavily fortified settlements of 3,000–4,000 people (e.g., Sesklo in Greece) whereas Neolithic groups in Britain were small (possibly 50–100 people) and highly mobile cattle-herders.

The details of the origin, chronology, social organization, subsistence practices and ideology of the peoples of Neolithic Europe are obtained from archaeology, and not historical records, since these people left none. Since the 1970s, population genetics has provided independent data on the population history of Neolithic Europe, including migration events and genetic relationships with peoples in South Asia.

A further independent tool, linguistics, has contributed hypothetical reconstructions of early European languages and family trees with estimates of dating of splits, in particular theories on the relationship between speakers of Indo-European languages and Neolithic peoples. Some archaeologists believe that the expansion of Neolithic peoples from southwest Asia into Europe, marking the eclipse of Mesolithic culture, coincided with the introduction of Indo-European speakers, whereas other archaeologists and many linguists believe the Indo-European languages were introduced from the Pontic–Caspian steppe during the succeeding Bronze Age.

==Archaeology==


Archeologists trace the emergence of food-producing societies in the Levantine region of southwest Asia to the close of the last glacial period around 12,000 BC, and these developed into a number of regionally distinctive cultures by the eighth millennium BC. Remains of food-producing societies in the Aegean have been carbon-dated to at Knossos, Franchthi Cave, and a number of mainland sites in Thessaly. Neolithic groups appear soon afterwards in the rest of Southeast Europe and south-central Europe. The Neolithic cultures of Southeast Europe (including the Aegean) show some continuity with groups in southwest Asia and Anatolia (e.g., Çatalhöyük).

In 2018, an 8,000-year-old ceramic figurine portraying the head of the &quot;Mother Goddess&quot;, was found near Uzunovo, Vidin Province in Bulgaria, which pushes back the Neolithic revolution to 7th millennium BC.

Current evidence suggests that Neolithic material culture was introduced to Europe via western Anatolia, and that similarities in cultures of North Africa and the Pontic steppes are due to diffusion &quot;out&quot; of Europe. All Neolithic sites in Europe contain ceramics, and contain the plants and animals domesticated in Southwest Asia: einkorn, emmer, barley, lentils, pigs, goats, sheep, and cattle. Genetic data suggest that no independent domestication of animals took place in Neolithic Europe, and that all domesticated animals were originally domesticated in Southwest Asia. The only domesticate not from Southwest Asia was broomcorn millet, domesticated in East Asia. The earliest evidence of cheese-making dates to 5500 BC in Kuyavia, Poland.

Archaeologists agreed for some time that the culture of the early Neolithic is relatively homogeneous, compared to the late Mesolithic. DNA studies tend to confirm this, indicating that agriculture was brought to Western Europe by the Aegean populations, that are known as &#x27;the Aegean Neolithic farmers&#x27;. When these farmers arrived in Britain, DNA studies show that they did not seem to mix much with the earlier population of the Western Hunter-Gatherers. Instead, there was a substantial population replacement.

The diffusion of these farmers across Europe, from the Aegean to Britain, took about 2,500 years (6500–4000 BC). The Baltic region was penetrated a bit later, , and there was also a delay in settling the Pannonian plain. In general, colonization shows a &quot;saltatory&quot; pattern, as the Neolithic advanced from one patch of fertile alluvial soil to another, bypassing mountainous areas. Analysis of radiocarbon dates show clearly that Mesolithic and Neolithic populations lived side by side for as much as a millennium in many parts of Europe, especially in the Iberian peninsula and along the Atlantic coast.

Investigation of the Neolithic skeletons found in the Talheim Death Pit suggests that prehistoric men from neighboring tribes were prepared to fight and kill each other in order to capture and secure women. The mass grave at Talheim in southern Germany is one of the earliest known sites in the archaeological record that shows evidence of organised violence in Early Neolithic Europe, among various Linear Pottery culture tribes. 
The archaeological site of Herxheim contained the scattered remains of more than 1000 individuals from different, in some cases faraway regions, who died around 5000 BC. Whether they were war captives or human sacrifices is unclear, but the evidence indicates that their corpses were spit-roasted whole and then consumed.

In terms of overall size, some settlements of the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture, such as Talianki (with a population of around 15,000) in western Ukraine, were as large as the city-states of Sumer in the Fertile Crescent, and these Eastern European settlements predate the Sumerian cities by more than half of a millennium.

== End of the Neolithic and transition to the Copper age ==
With some exceptions, population levels rose rapidly at the beginning of the Neolithic until they reached the carrying capacity. This was followed by a population crash of &quot;enormous magnitude&quot; after 5000 BC, with levels remaining low during the next 1,500 years.

The oldest golden artifacts in the world (4600 BC - 4200 BC) are found in the Varna Necropolis, Bulgaria - grave offerings on exposition in Varna Archaeological Museum
Populations began to rise after 3500 BC, with further dips and rises occurring between 3000 and 2500 BC but varying in date between regions. Around this time is the Neolithic decline, when populations collapsed across most of Europe, possibly caused by climatic conditions, plague, or mass migration. A study of twelve European regions found most experienced boom and bust patterns and suggested an &quot;endogenous, not climatic cause&quot;. Recent archaeological evidence suggests the possibility of plague causing this population collapse, as mass graves dating from were discovered containing fragments of &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; genetic material consistent with pneumonic plague.

The Chalcolithic Age in Europe started from about 3500 BC, followed soon after by the European Bronze Age. This also became a period of increased megalithic construction. From 3500 BC, copper was being used in the Balkans and eastern and central Europe. Also, the domestication of the horse took place during that time, resulting in the increased mobility of cultures.

Nearing the close of the Neolithic, , large numbers of Eurasian steppe peoples migrated in Southeast and Central from eastern Europe, from the Pontic–Caspian steppe north of the Black Sea.

==Genetics==
Genetic studies since the 2010s have identified the genetic contribution of Neolithic farmers to modern European populations, providing quantitative results relevant to the long-standing &quot;replacement model&quot; vs. &quot;demic diffusion&quot; dispute in archaeology.

The earlier population of Europe were the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, called the &quot;Western Hunter-Gatherers&quot; (WHG). Along with the Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers (SHG) and Eastern Hunter-Gatherers (EHG), the WHGs constituted one of the three main genetic groups in the postglacial period of early Holocene Europe. Later, the Neolithic farmers expanded from the Aegean and Near East; in various studies, they are described as the Early European Farmers (EEF); Aegean Neolithic Farmers (ANF), First European Farmers (FEF), or also as the Early Neolithic Farmers (ENF).

A seminal 2014 study first identified the contribution of three main components to modern European lineages (the third being &quot;Ancient North Eurasians&quot;, associated with the later Indo-European expansion). The EEF component was identified based on the genome of a woman buried c. 7,000 years ago in a Linear Pottery culture grave in Stuttgart, Germany.

This 2014 study found evidence for genetic mixing between WHG and EEF throughout Europe, with the largest contribution of EEF in Mediterranean Europe (especially in Sardinia, Sicily, Malta and among Ashkenazi Jews), and the largest contribution of WHG in Northern Europe and among Basque people.

Nevertheless, DNA studies show that when the Neolithic farmers arrived in Britain, these two groups did not seem to mix much. Instead, there was a substantial population replacement.

Since 2014, further studies have refined the picture of interbreeding between EEF and WHG. In a 2017 analysis of 180 ancient DNA datasets of the Chalcolithic and Neolithic periods from Hungary, Germany and Spain, evidence was found of a prolonged period of interbreeding. Admixture took place regionally, from local hunter-gatherer populations, so that populations from the three regions (Germany, Iberia and Hungary) were genetically distinguishable at all stages of the Neolithic period, with a gradually increasing ratio of WHG ancestry of farming populations over time. This suggests that after the initial expansion of early farmers, there were no further long-range migrations substantial enough to homogenize the farming population, and that farming and hunter-gatherer populations existed side by side for many centuries, with ongoing gradual admixture throughout the 5th to 4th millennia BC (rather than a single admixture event on initial contact). Admixture rates varied geographically; in the late Neolithic, WHG ancestry in farmers in Hungary was at around 10%, in Germany around 25% and in Iberia as high as 50%.

During late Neolithic and early Bronze Age, the EEF-derived cultures of Europe were overwhelmed by successive invasions of Western Steppe Herders (WSHs) from the Pontic–Caspian steppe. These invasions led to EEF paternal DNA lineages in Europe being almost entirely replaced with WSH paternal DNA (mainly R1b and R1a). EEF mtDNA however remained frequent, suggesting admixture between WSH males and EEF females. 
==Language==
There is no direct evidence of the languages spoken in the Neolithic. Some proponents of paleolinguistics attempt to extend the methods of historical linguistics to the Stone Age, but this has little academic support. Criticising scenarios which envision for the Neolithic only a small number of language families spread over huge areas of Europe (as in modern times), Donald Ringe has argued on general principles of language geography (as concerns &quot;tribal&quot;, pre-state societies), and the scant remains of (apparently indigenous) non-Indo-European languages attested in ancient inscriptions, that Neolithic Europe must have been a place of great linguistic diversity, with many language families with no recoverable linguistic links to each other, much like western North America prior to European colonisation.

Discussion of hypothetical languages spoken in the European Neolithic is divided into two topics, Indo-European languages and &quot;Pre-Indo-European&quot; languages.

Early Indo-European languages are usually assumed to have reached Danubian (and maybe Central) Europe in the Chalcolithic or early Bronze Age, e.g. with the Corded Ware or Beaker cultures (see also Kurgan hypothesis for related discussions). The Anatolian hypothesis postulates arrival of Indo-European languages with the early Neolithic. Old European hydronymy is taken by Hans Krahe to be the oldest reflection of the early presence of Indo-European in Europe.

Theories of &quot;Pre-Indo-European&quot; languages in Europe are built on scant evidence. The Basque language is the best candidate for a descendant of such a language, but since Basque is a language isolate, there is no comparative evidence to build upon. Theo Vennemann nevertheless postulates a &quot;Vasconic&quot; family, which he supposes had co-existed with an &quot;Atlantic&quot; or &quot;Semitidic&quot; (i. e., para-Semitic) group. Another candidate is a Tyrrhenian family which would have given rise to Etruscan and Raetic in the Iron Age, and possibly also Aegean languages such as Minoan or Pelasgian in the Bronze Age.

In the north, a similar scenario to Indo-European is thought to have occurred with Uralic languages expanding in from the east. In particular, while the Sami languages of the indigenous Sami people belong in the Uralic family, they show considerable substrate influence, thought to represent one or more extinct original languages. The Sami are estimated to have adopted a Uralic language less than 2,500 years ago. Some traces of indigenous languages of the Baltic area have been suspected in the Finnic languages as well, but these are much more modest. There are early loanwords from unidentified non-IE languages in other Uralic languages of Europe as well.

Guus Kroonen brought up the so-called &quot;Agricultural Substrate Hypothesis&quot;, based on the comparison of presumable Pre-Germanic and Pre-Greek substrate lexicon (especially agricultural terms without clear IE etymologies). Kroonen links that substrate to the gradual spread of agriculture in Neolithic Europe from Anatolia and the Balkans, and associates the Pre-Germanic agricultural substrate language with the Linear Pottery culture. The prefix &quot;*a-&quot; and the suffix &quot;*-it-&quot; are the most apparent linguistic markers by which a small group of &quot;Agricultural&quot; substrate words - i.e. &quot;*arwīt&quot; (&quot;pea&quot;) or &quot;*gait&quot; (&quot;goat&quot;) - can be isolated from the rest of the Proto-Germanic lexicon. According to Aljoša Šorgo, there are at least 36 Proto-Germanic lexical items very likely originating from the &quot;agricultural&quot; substrate language (or a group of closely related languages). It is proposed by Šorgo that the Agricultural substrate was characterized by a four-vowel system of */æ/ */ɑ/ */i/ */u/, the presence of pre-nasalized stops, the absence of a semi-vowel */j/, a mobile stress accent, and reduction of unstressed vowels.

<text>Psyduck (), known as in Japan, is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, Psyduck first appeared in the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; and later in sequels. It has later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. A Psyduck also appears as part of the main cast in the live-action animated film &quot;Pokémon Detective Pikachu&quot;. Psyduck has been voiced by Michael Haigney and Rikako Aikawa since its debut. 

A duck-like Pokémon, Psyduck is constantly stunned by its headache, and usually just stands vacantly, trying to calm itself. In the anime series, Psyduck&#x27;s appearances became a running gag; Misty, a major supporting character, would often release Psyduck by accident instead of the Pokémon she wanted to use. Psyduck has been met with a primarily positive response since its debut, primarily in its role in the &quot;Pokémon Concierge&quot; television series.

==Design and characteristics==
Psyduck is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Some Pokémon can transform into stronger species through a process called evolution via various means, such as exposure to specific items. Each Pokémon have one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.

Introduced in &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, the design started as pixel art sprites by the development team first, with a single color identity chosen to work within the Super Game Boy hardware limitations. While conceived as a group effort by multiple developers at Game Freak, the finalized design and artwork was done by Ken Sugimori. Originally tasked with drawing the characters to illustrate a planned strategy guide by Game Freak when the games released, Sugimori drew all the sprites for the game in his style to not only unify their designs visually but also modify any design elements he felt were amiss, while trying to retain the original sprite artists&#x27; unique styles. Originally called &quot;Koduck&quot; in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pokémon species &quot;clever and descriptive names&quot; related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. As a result, they were renamed &quot;Psyduck&quot;, a combination of the words &quot;psychic&quot; and &quot;duck&quot;.

Psyduck is constantly stunned by its headache, and usually just stands there vacantly, trying to calm its headache. When the headache gets too bad, its brain cells awaken, allowing it to use strong psychic powers. Psyduck is classified in-game as a Water-type Pokémon. When a Psyduck receives enough experience from battles, it evolves into Golduck. During the initial pitch of the 2019 film &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot;, writers Benji Samit and Dan Hernandez stated that they wanted Psyduck in the film, citing that this was because it was &quot;their favorite.&quot; Hernandez stated that &quot;Because I&#x27;m a neurotic writer, I really relate to getting stressed and more stressed and more stressed and then just exploding... and for that reason, I&#x27;ve always felt a great kinship to Psyduck, so we thought that was really important to get him in there.&quot; Psyduck was also initially planned to be one of the cover mascots of the &quot;Pokémon, Let&#x27;s Go!&quot; games, though it was ultimately scrapped due to Eevee&#x27;s popularity and Psyduck&#x27;s yellow color scheme clashing with the other decided mascot, Pikachu. Psyduck has been voiced by Michael Haigney in English and by Rikako Aikawa in Japanese.

==Appearances==
Psyduck made its debut appearance in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video game series in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, before later appearing in all mainline entries in the series. It has since gone to make a variety of appearances in spin-off games, such as the &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; series, the &quot;Pokémon Mystery Dungeon&quot; series, &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;, and the &quot;Pokémon Rumble&quot; series.

In the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime, Misty, a major supporting character in the series, has a Psyduck that she accidentally caught, serving as a constant source of frustration for her, as it frequently emerges to attempt to battle the opponent in substitution of the Pokémon she intends to use, and in instances where she does intend to use it, it often does not act. When its headache gets bad enough, it has been shown to use phenomenally powerful Psychic-type moves which far exceed its perceived potential. As such, it often acts as comic relief within the anime. Psyduck have appeared at various points in the &quot;Pokémon Adventures&quot; manga. Psyduck appears in the 2019 film &quot;Pokémon Detective Pikachu&quot; as the partner to the female lead of the film, junior unpaid reporter Lucy Stevens (portrayed by Kathryn Newton). It also appears in the 2023 animated series &quot;Pokémon Concierge&quot;, in which a shy Psyduck is a wild Pokémon in the Pokémon Resort, an island where Pokémon come to visit and relax. It ends up befriending the protagonist, Haru, and the two become close friends.

==Promotion and reception==

Psyduck has appeared in multiple pieces of merchandise, including plush toys, battery-powered toys, pins, and cards in the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;. Zavvi has launched licensed T-shirts featuring Psyduck and other popular generation I species. Psyduck-inspired cast necklaces have also been available in Japan. The first Pokémon Jet, a Boeing 747-400D for All Nippon Airways, has Psyduck and nine other Pokémon on its livery. A life-sized Psyduck plush was released by The Pokemon Company in 2020, later being rereleased in 2023.

Described as &quot;silly&quot; by &quot;GameSpy&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Psyduck has been well received by the media, identified as one of the most popular characters in the original games by &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; and &quot;Kotaku&quot;. Psyduck is Pokémon developer Junichi Masuda&#x27;s favorite Pokémon. &quot;GameDaily&quot; staff felt it was among the more unique Pokémon designs, while &quot;IGN&quot; felt it was a cult favorite among fans due to its &quot;bizarre, bewildered appearance.&quot; Alex Walker of &quot;Kotaku&quot; highlighted it as a relatable character, also citing its role as comic relief in the Pokémon anime. It was also cited as a favorite character by &quot;IGN&quot; staff. The &quot;Coventry Evening Telegraph&quot; also praised its design, stating the character was &quot;more interesting&quot; in comparison to more commonly seen Pokémon such as Squirtle, though James Stephanie Sterling of &quot;Destructoid&quot; was more critical, calling it &quot;annoying&quot; and &quot;irritating.&quot; Psyduck has also been criticized for associations to the occult. Author Cindy Jacobs criticized Psyduck&#x27;s occult powers, while Pastor Phil Arms discussed how its psychic powers reflected &quot;New Age&quot; ideas of altered states of consciousness.

Psyduck&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Pokémon Concierge&quot; has been received positively. James Whitbrook, writing for &quot;Gizmodo&quot;, found Psyduck and its relationship with the show&#x27;s protagonist, Haru, a relatable centerpiece of the show. He highlighted their relationship as a relatable and welcoming message. Jade King, writing for &quot;TheGamer&quot;, found Psyduck&#x27;s role and emotions in the show akin to feelings of social anxiety, and praised the messages delivered by Psyduck overcoming its own anxieties to befriend Haru. Ana Diaz, writing for &quot;Polygon&quot;, also praised Psyduck&#x27;s role in the show, stating that &quot;Every scene with Psyduck is like viewing a brief, but fleeting moment of pure, unadulterated thoughtless bliss.&quot; She also highlighted how the show helped portray Psyduck in a more positive light, primarily in comparison in its role in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime series. Emma Stefansky, writing for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, cited similar sentiments, stating that the series &quot;wisely recognizes the dramatic potential of Psyduck.&quot; She highlighted the usage of Psyduck, primarily used as comic relief, as a relatable figure in the series. Actress Rena Nōnen, who played Haru in the series, cited that it had become her favorite Pokemon as a result of the series.

<text>Miracle is a 2004 American sports film directed by Gavin O&#x27;Connor and written by Eric Guggenheim. It is about the U.S. men&#x27;s ice hockey team, whose gold medal victory in the 1980 Winter Olympics over the heavily favored seasoned Soviet team was dubbed the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot;. Kurt Russell stars as head coach Herb Brooks with Patricia Clarkson and Noah Emmerich in supporting roles.

&quot;Miracle&quot; was released on February 6, 2004, and grossed $64.5 million on a $28 million budget. It received positive reviews, with Russell&#x27;s performance garnering the most praise from critics.

== Plot ==

Herb Brooks, head ice hockey coach at the University of Minnesota, interviews with the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) for the national team coach&#x27;s job, discussing his philosophy on how to beat the dominant Soviet team who have won the gold medal in the previous four Olympics, calling for changes to the practice schedule and strategy. The USOC is skeptical, but gives Brooks the job.

Brooks meets assistant coach Craig Patrick at the tryouts in Colorado Springs. Brooks selects a preliminary roster of 26, indifferent to the preferences of senior USOC hockey officials. USOC executive director Walter Bush believes Brooks has their best interests at heart, and reluctantly agrees to take the heat from the committee.

During the initial practice, tempers flare as forward Rob McClanahan and defenseman Jack O&#x27;Callahan get into a fight based on college rivalry. After the fight, Brooks tells all the players that they are to let go of old rivalries and start becoming a team. He has each player tell their name, hometown and which team they play for. As practices continue, Brooks uses unorthodox methods to reduce the roster to 20 players. The players themselves worry about being cut at any time, knowing that Brooks himself was the last player cut from the US squad that won the 1960 Olympic gold medal, so he will do anything to win.

During an exhibition game against Norway in Oslo that ends in a 3–3 tie, Brooks notices the players are not playing up to their potential. After the game, he orders them back on the ice for a bag skatea relentless skate from one end of the ice to the other, continuing the drill even after the rink manager cuts the power, until forward and team captain Mike Eruzione re-introduces himself, but this time says that he plays for the United States. Pleased, Brooks finally allows the team to go home.

With their roster finalized, the Americans play the Soviets in an exhibition game at Madison Square Garden. The Soviets manhandle the young Americans, winning by a score of 10–3. During the game, O&#x27;Callahan suffers a knee injury that could keep him out of the entire Olympics and starting goaltender Jim Craig is told he may be benched in favor of backup Steve Janaszak. Brooks tells him that he hasn&#x27;t been giving his very best, but decides to keep Craig as the starter for the Olympics.

As the 1980 Winter Olympics begin, the Americans trail Sweden 2–1 in the first game. Brooks fires up the team during intermission by throwing a table and accuses McClanahan, who suffered a relatively minor leg injury, of quitting. McClanahan plays injured, which inspires the team. Bill Baker scores a goal with only 27 seconds remaining in the third period for a dramatic 2–2 tie. They next earn a 7–3 win over heavily favored Czechoslovakia. As the Olympics continue, the team defeats minor opponents Norway, Romania, and West Germany to earn a spot in the medal round.

In the medal round, the Americans are overwhelming underdogs to the Soviets, who lost only a single Olympic game since 1964 and whose players are professionals, whereas the American players are amateurs. The Soviets score the first goal before O&#x27;Callahan, having healed enough from his injury, enters the game for the first time. He heavily checks Vladimir Krutov on a play that leads to a goal by Buzz Schneider. The Soviets score again to retake the lead. Soviet goalie Vladislav Tretiak stops a long shot by Dave Christian, but Mark Johnson gets the rebound and ties the game to end the period.

During the first intermission, Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov replaces Tretiak with backup Vladimir Myshkin. In the second period, the Soviets score a goal to go up 3–2. Early in the third period, the Soviet team is penalized for slashing, and Johnson scores a power play goal just as the penalty is about to expire. With 10 minutes left, Eruzione puts them ahead 4–3. The Americans hold off the Soviets to win the game, completing one of the biggest upsets in sports history. Two days later, the team would go on to defeat Finland 4–2 to win the gold medal.

== Production ==
Gavin O&#x27;Connor directed, and Mark Ciardi produced the movie. Both are drawn to inspirational stories, and they decided to take on the &quot;Greatest Sports Moment of the 20th Century&quot;. They chose to focus on the determination and focus of coach Herb Brooks. O&#x27;Connor knew from the beginning that he wanted to cast Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks because he needed someone with an athletic background and a fiery passion for sports. The casting of the team consisted of real hockey players to give the film a raw and accurate feel. O&#x27;Connor figured it would be easier to teach hockey players to act than to teach actors to play hockey. On-ice tryouts were held in New York, Boston, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Toronto, and Vancouver. Another tryout was held in Vancouver for the Soviet and European teams.

There are a total of 133 different hockey plays in the film. To accomplish this, the directors turned to ReelSports Solutions, who had helped with the producers on a previous movie, &quot;The Rookie&quot;. The ReelSports team referred to coach Herb Brooks for information on practices, plays, equipment, and uniform styles. Each fight and stunt scene was choreographed to ensure the actors&#x27; safety. Players went through a six-week training camp to relearn the game in older equipment.

All the locations of the real life hockey games are replicated by hockey arenas in British Columbia. The team tryouts, set in Colorado Springs, were filmed at the Queen&#x27;s Park Arena in New Westminster. The team practices were filmed at the M.S.A. Arena in Abbotsford. The exhibition game in which the USA team lost to the USSR team at Madison Square Garden was filmed at the Pacific Coliseum, former home of the Vancouver Canucks. The Exhibition against Norway, the subsequent bag skate, and all Olympic game scenes were filmed at the PNE Agrodome.

Al Michaels and Ken Dryden re-recorded most of their television commentary for the film. However, the last 30 seconds of the USA-Soviet game, including Michaels&#x27; &quot;Do you believe in miracles?&quot;, used the original audio, as Michaels didn&#x27;t feel he could re-create the call effectively.

Coach Brooks died in a car accident half a year before the movie was released. At the end, before the credits, it states, &quot;This film is dedicated to the memory of Herb Brooks, who died shortly following principal photography. He never saw it. He lived it.&quot;

Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that the movie &quot;does a yeoman&#x27;s job of recycling the day-old dough that passes for its story.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; referred to the movie as &quot;a classically well-made studio entertainment that, like &quot;The Rookie&quot; of a few years back, has the knack of being moving without shamelessly overdoing a sure thing.&quot; Bill Muller of &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; gave it a 2.5 out of a 5 scoring, saying, &quot;Even for a Disney sports movie, this is a treacly affair, complete with an &quot;Armageddon&quot;-style hero shot that just screams manipulation.&quot; Deborah Hornblow of &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; earned a rating of 3 out of 5, stating that &quot;the result is something like the &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; of sports team films or a &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; of the Cold War.&quot; O&#x27;Callahan said in an interview that while the fight between him and McClanahan was fictional, the film accurately portrayed the &quot;pretty intense&quot; rivalry between Boston Terriers and Minnesota Gophers players, and was overall &quot;pretty darn close&quot; to actual events.

<text>Nanyang is a prefecture-level city in the southwest of Henan province, China. The city with the largest administrative area in Henan, Nanyang borders Xinyang to the southeast, Zhumadian to the east, Pingdingshan to the northeast, Luoyang to the north, Sanmenxia to the northwest, the province of Shaanxi to the west, and the province of Hubei to the south.

Nanyang is known for its outstanding people and land, producing numerous talents. In history, it has nurtured the &quot;sage of science&quot; Zhang Heng, &quot;sage of medicine&quot; Zhang Zhongjing, &quot;sage of commerce&quot; Fan Li, and &quot;sage of intelligence&quot; Zhuge Liang. It has also nurtured contemporary celebrities such as philosopher Feng Youlan, military strategist Peng Xuefeng, literary figure Yao Xueyin, technological inventor Wang Yongmin, and writer Er Yuehe.

Dinosaur egg fossils have been discovered in the Nanyang Basin.

== Names ==
In the name &quot;Nanyang&quot; (), &quot;Nan&quot; () means south, and &quot;Yang&quot; (/) means sun—the south side of a mountain, or the north side of a river, in Chinese is called &quot;Yang&quot;. The name came from Nanyang Commandery, a commandery established in the region during the Warring States period. Before the name &quot;Nanyang&quot; became associated with the city itself, it was referred to as &quot;Wan&quot; ().Nanyang, also known as Wan, Nandu, and Dixiang.

==History==

550,000 years ago, Nanzhao Man inhabited near Xinghuashan, Nanzhao. Between 5,000 BCE and 3,000 BCE, a substantial Neolithic settlement thrived in Huangshan, situated north of Nanyang. Excavations of the Huangshan ruins have uncovered remnants of jade workshops, high-level tombs, wharves, and granaries. The Huangshan Archeological Site provided insight into the formation of Chinese civilization. The Baliqiao site in Fangcheng County is a core settlement of the Erlitou culture. It served as an important hub for the transfer and control of resources. Nanyang was the capital of the state of Shen in the first millennium BCE. After the unification of the six states by Qin, the &quot;relocation of unruly people to Nanyang&quot; brought together the wealthy and skilled merchants and artisans of the six states, promoting the development of Nanyang&#x27;s economy, especially the iron smelting industry, which became one of the national iron smelting centers. It became commercially important under the Han dynasty, as it had many iron foundries and other manufacturing sites, and also fell at the convergence of routes between major cities. It&#x27;s an important city of the Silk Road. Emperor Gengshi&#x27;s enthronement took place on the banks of the Bai River in Nanyang. Later, with the help of the 28 generals of the Cloud Terrace and the financial support of Nanyang, Liu Xiu successfully ascended to power and established the Eastern Han dynasty. Nanyang became the southern capital, ranking as the second largest city after Luoyang, the capital. During that time, Nanyang was home to numerous influential families. Nanyang subsequently declined somewhat in importance, but remained a political and cultural center of southwestern Henan province and a hub for trade.

<text>A sports film is a film genre in which any particular sport plays a prominent role in the film&#x27;s plot or acts as its central theme. It is a production in which a sport or a sports-related topic is prominently featured or is a focus of the plot. Despite this, sport is ultimately rarely the central concern of such films and sport performs primarily an allegorical role. Furthermore, sports fans are not necessarily the target demographic in such movies, but sports fans tend to maintain a high following and esteem for such movies.

==Subgenres==
The first sports film was released 1915, this was during the era of silent films. 
Several sub-categories of sports films can be identified, although the delineations between these subgenres, much as in live action, are somewhat fluid.

The most common sports subgenres depicted in movies are sports drama and sports comedy. Both categories typically employ playground settings, match, game creatures and other elements commonly associated with biological stories.

Sports films tend to feature a more richly developed sport world, and may also be more player-oriented or thematically complex. Often, they feature a hero of adventure origins and a clear distinction between loss and victory set against each other in a play time struggle.

Thematically, the story is often one of &quot;our team&quot; versus &quot;their team&quot;; their team will always try to win, and our team will show the world that they deserve recognition or redemption; the story does not always have to involve a team. The story could also be about an individual athlete or the story could focus on an individual playing on a team.

=== Sports comedy ===
Sports comedy combines the sports film genre with comedy film elements. Traditionally, these films heavily rely on slapstick humor and very physical comedy, such as someone getting hurt in a comical way. A typical storyline may revolve around someone losing sight of the sport they are playing and trying to get back into it. Examples and staples of the genre include &quot;The Waterboy&quot;, &quot;The Longest Yard&quot;, &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot;, and &quot;Blades of Glory&quot;.

=== Sports drama ===
Sports drama combines the sports film genre with drama film elements. These films rely on conflict, usually revolving around an athlete or a team. These dramas can further be broken up into categories, some movies focusing on race such as &quot;42&quot; (2013), or focusing on a specific moment in history like I, Tonya (2018). Examples of this overall genre/type include: &quot;Body and Soul&quot; (1947), &quot;The Hustler&quot; (1961), &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976), &quot;Hoosiers&quot; (1986), &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; (2000), Lagaan (2001), &quot;Moneyball&quot; (2011), &quot;Ford v Ferrari&quot; (2019), &quot;Ferrari&quot; (2023) and the &quot;Goal!&quot; trilogy.

== Award-winning films ==
There have been numerous sports movies that have become award winning phenomena. Several films have been nominated for and won the highest award of Best Picture at the Academy Awards, including &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981), &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976), and &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; (2004). Other movies that received awards of a high caliber are &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (Best Supporting Actor, 1996), &quot;Bull Durham&quot; (Best Original Screenplay, 1988), and &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (Best Supporting Actor, 1984).

<text>is a Japanese photographer best known for his black-and-white street photography and association with the avant-garde photography magazine &quot;Provoke&quot;.

Moriyama began his career as an assistant to photographer Eikoh Hosoe, a co-founder of the avant-garde photo cooperative Vivo, and made his mark with his first photobook &quot;Japan: A Photo Theater&quot;, published in 1968. His formative work in the 1960s boldly captured the darker qualities of urban life in postwar Japan in rough, unfettered fashion, filtering the rawness of human experience through sharply tilted angles, grained textures, harsh contrast, and blurred movements through the photographer&#x27;s wandering gaze. Many of his well-known works from the 1960s and 1970s are read through the lenses of post-war reconstruction and post-Occupation cultural upheaval.

Moriyama continued to experiment with the representative possibilities offered by the camera in his 1969 &quot;Accident&quot; series, which was serialized over one year in the photo magazine &quot;Asahi Camera&quot;, in which he deployed his camera as a copying machine to reproduce existing media images. His 1972 photobook &quot;Farewell Photography&quot;, which was accompanied by an interview with his fellow &quot;Provoke&quot; photographer Takuma Nakahira, presents his radical effort to dismantle the medium.

Although the photobook is a favored format of presentation among Japanese photographers, Moriyama was particularly prolific: he has produced more than 150 photobooks since 1968. His creative career has been honored by a number of solo exhibitions by major institutions, along with his two-person exhibition with William Klein at Tate Modern in 2012–13. He has received numerous accolades throughout his career, including the Hasselblad Award in 2019 and the International Center of Photography Infinity Award in 2012.

==Career==
=== Early life and career beginnings ===
Moriyama was born in Ikeda, Osaka in 1938 as Hiromichi Moriyama. Owing to his father&#x27;s work, his family moved frequently, and Moriyama spent parts of his childhood in Tokyo, Hiroshima, Chiba, and Shimane (his paternal family&#x27;s home prefecture) before returning to Osaka around the age of 11.

From the ages of 16 to 20, he worked in graphic design before pivoting to photography in his early 20s after purchasing an inexpensive Canon IV Sb purchased from a friend. In Osaka, Moriyama worked at the studio of photographer Takeji Iwamiya before moving to Tokyo in 1961 to connect with the radical photography collective Vivo, whose work he admired. He eventually found work as an assistant to photographer and Vivo member Eikoh Hosoe, whom he credits with teaching him much of the fundamentals of photographic practice and technique. Yet for the three years he spent working for Hosoe, Moriyama did not take any photographs of his own until Hosoe, out of impatience, urged him to show him some of his own work.

As a young man coming of age in 1950s and &#x27;60s, Moriyama bore witness to the political unrest (illustrated most vividly in the 1960 Anpo protests), economic revival and mass consumerism, and radical art-making that characterized the two decades following the end of World War II. His first photobook, &quot;Nippon gekijō shashinchō&quot; (にっぽん劇場写真帖, &quot;Japan: A Photo Theater&quot;), published in 1968, captures the excitement, tension, anxiety, and rage of urban life during this critical historical juncture through a collection of images, indiscriminate in subject matter, presented in dizzying succession through full-page spreads. The photographs range from ordinary streetscapes featuring blurred faces and garish signage to snapshots alluding to the aggressive redevelopment taking place in Tokyo and the rubble left in its wake, as well as images of nightlife and darker elements of urban life. As the title of the photobook suggests, Moriyama&#x27;s approach hones in on the spectacle of everyday life, in all its ugliness and splendor.

=== &quot;Provoke&quot; (1969–70) ===

In 1965, a series of photographs of preserved human embryos, titled &quot;Mugon geki&quot; (&quot;silent theatre&quot;, &quot;Pantomime&quot;), by Moriyama were published in the magazine &quot;Gendai no me&quot; and caught the attention of avant-garde poet Shūji Terayama. Terayama commissioned Moriyama to provide accompanying images for his experimental theatre and prose works, providing Moriyama with a boost in his early career and connecting him to other avant-garde creatives including Tadanori Yokoo and Takuma Nakahira. His connection to Nakahira, a founding member of the photography magazine &quot;Provoke,&quot; eventually led to his participation in the publication beginning with the second issue in 1969.

Moriyama is widely recognized for his work associated with the short-lived but deeply influential magazine, which was founded by photographers Takuma Nakahira and Yutaka Takanishi, along with critic Kōji Taki and writer Takahiko Okada in 1968. The publication popularized the &quot;are, bure, boke&quot; style, translated as &quot;grainy/rough, blurry, out-of-focus,&quot; an aesthetic rebuttal to the dominant European-style photojournalism style (exemplified by Ken Domon&#x27;s realist approach) and straightforward commercial work that dominated the Japanese photography scene at the time. These visions of everyday life rejected the notion that photography captures a lucid reflection of the world undergirded by a legible ideological argument; rather, they sought to emphasize the fragmentary nature of reality and make evident the photographer&#x27;s prowling, wandering gaze.

Eroticism and masculinized subjectivity are often associated with Moriyama&#x27;s contributions to the magazine, as evidenced by works such as &quot;Eros&quot; (1969), featured in the second issue of the publication. The grainy, skewed image features a nude woman smoking a cigarette on a hotel bed—suggestive of the aftermath of a tryst. Her back faces the viewer, while her surroundings are shrouded in dense shadows, giving the camera&#x27;s gaze a furtive and ominous air.

As stated in the magazine&#x27;s 1968 manifesto, &quot;[T]he images [&quot;eizō&quot;] themselves are not ideas. They do not possess the wholeness of concepts, neither are they a communicative code like language...But this irreversible materiality [&quot;hikagyakuteki bussitsusei&quot;] – reality cut off from the camera – constitutes the reverse side of the world defined by language; and for this reason, [the image] is at times able to provoke the world of language and ideas.&quot; &quot;Provoke&quot; sought to assert photography&#x27;s role in producing a phenomenological encounter that focused on the bodily and the immediate, moving beyond preconceived notions of truth, reality, and vision to probe questions surrounding the identity of photographic matter and the roles of the photographer, subject, and viewer. Though the collective only produced three issues and a book, &quot;First, Abandon the World of Pseudocertainty – Thoughts on Photography and Language&quot; (1970), each member continued to publicize their work in close relation to the &quot;era of Provoke,&quot; and the magazine has had an immense cultural impact and been the subject of numerous international exhibitions.

=== &quot;Akushidento&quot; (Accident) (1969) ===
In 1968, Moriyama began producing a series focused on the theme of &quot;equivalence&quot; using images featured in mass media as his source material. According to Moriyama, the series was prompted by an experience he had at a train terminal in Tokyo, whereupon he was shocked to see the news of Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination on the front page of newspapers scattered all around him. Taking interest in the mediated nature of press images, Moriyama says in an interview with Nakahira that this encounter prompted him to become &quot;determined to negate the values that are attached to one single photograph.&quot; Moriyama photographed images reproduced from different mass media, including a television still of Lyndon B. Johnson announcing the suspension of the bombing of North Vietnam, newswire shots of Richard Nixon shortly after winning the presidential election, and the corpses of brutally killed Vietcong soldiers, along with the aforementioned image of Robert F. Kennedy. Moriyama treated the camera as a device that copies reality and thus produces &quot;equivalents,&quot; rendering insignificant the distance that the original photographs, the endlessly reproduced press images, and Moriyama&#x27;s own versions have from the initial event. The twelve-part series was published in &quot;Asahi Camera&quot; alongside his own texts, where he describes the unpredictability of fate and the precariousness of human experience, believing that the camera has the capacity to reveal the &quot;possibility of tragedy [that] has somehow seeped into the surrounding environment.&quot;

=== &quot;Shashin yo sayōnara&quot; (Farewell Photography) (1972) ===
Published in April 1972, &quot;Shashin yo sayōnara&quot; (&quot;Farewell Photography&quot;) emerged within the context of Japan&#x27;s aggressive cultural and economic revival—best exemplified in the creative sphere by Expo &#x27;70—and continued suppression of left-wing politics, as illustrated by the failure of the 1970 Anpo protests and the subsequent renewal of the United States-Japan Security Treaty. The photobook, as suggested by the title, takes a nihilistic turn from his prior work, turning its attention towards the incidental and evocative nature of photography rather than the visual subject itself. The images highlight the physical detritus of the photographic process, such as the edges of discarded film, flecks of dust, and light leaks, along with the material dimensions of image-making as evidenced through the sprocket holes on negative strips and the brand names of the film, challenging the indexical relationship between photographer, camera, and image and the established conventions of viewing photographs as referents of reality.

=== &quot;Karyūdo&quot; (A Hunter) (1972) ===
Inspired by the liberatory and indeterminate qualities of Sal Paradise&#x27;s journey in Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot; (1957, first Japanese translation published in 1959), Moriyama borrowed a friend&#x27;s old Toyota and embarked on a solo road trip across Japan, capturing photographs along the trip that would become the basis for &quot;Karyūdo&quot; (&quot;A Hunter&quot;), a photobook published in June 1972 as the tenth installment of the series &quot;Gendai no me&quot; (&quot;The Modern Gaze&quot;). Many of the scenes were captured by Moriyama as he drove past them, made evident by the skewed angles, blurry, moving figures, and fragments of road infrastructure that cut across the picture plane. The title of the volume refers to his &quot;stalker-life&quot; attitude towards observing and capturing his surroundings, through the perspective of a cold, detached, solitary watcher. At the same time, the volume maintains a certain open-endedness in its format, lacking any sort of narrative resolution that might typically accompany the trope of a road trip or a hunting excursion, and instead putting forth a sensation of perpetual anxiety and uncertainty through its succession of consistently detached and irresolvable images of subjects and scenes across Japan.

The book contains some of Moriyama&#x27;s best-known images, including &quot;Stray Dog, Misawa, 1971&quot;, which depicts a growling, haggard dog turning its head towards the camera. The image was taken in Misawa, Aomori prefecture, where a large US Air Force base is located (Moriyama shot at other U.S. military bases throughout his career, including at the naval base in Yokosuka. The introduction of the book was written by pop artist and graphic designer Tadanori Yokoo, who wrote of Moriyama&#x27;s pictures as being akin to &quot;someone who talks, without looking people in the eye.&quot; The book was re-released in 2011 with the addition of new commentary by Moriyama.

=== Later work ===
In 1974 Moriyama helped Shōmei Tōmatsu to establish the &quot;Workshop Photography School&quot; to teach their new understanding of photography to students. Nobuyoshi Araki, Eikoh Hosoe, Masahisa Fukase were also involved. They published a magazine, the &quot;Workshop Quarterly,&quot; that reached eight issues. When the engagement broke up two years later, Moriyama and his students founded &quot;Image Shop Camp,&quot; the first gallery in Japan dedicated exclusively to photography. In the eight years of their existence the around 30 members had organized 200 exhibitions, and &quot;gave rise to some of the most explosive happenings in the history of post-war Japanese photography.&quot;

In 1974 the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo organized the photography exhibition &quot;Fifteen Photographers Today,&quot; curated by Tsutomu Watanabe, who had selected Moriyama, Araki and Fukase alongside Shoko Hashimoto, Kazuo Kitai, Masatoshi Naito, Takuma Nakahira, Takao Nikura, Hajime Sawatari, Kishin Shinoyama, Yutaka Takanashi, Shigeru Tamura, Katsumi Watanabe, Shuji Yamada, and Shin Yanagisawa.
Moriyama&#x27;s work, through intimately engaged with the intricacies of social life and the image-laden nature of modern society, did not aspire to the same tendencies of social reportage exhibited by his contemporaries during the 1970s. Instead, his approach takes into account the futility of the medium in reproducing the reality of his surroundings, the inherently fragmentary nature of the world, and the indelible presence of the photographer in all images, lurking or haunting the sphere of his subjects.

He has continued to shoot artistic as well as commercial work over the decades both in and outside of Japan, and is one of the most active and prolific contemporary photographers in Japan. In 2024, he photoshot American rapper Kanye West&#x27;s cover of his upcoming eleventh studio album &quot;Bully&quot;.

== Style and technique ==
=== Influences ===
Influences cited by Moriyama include Seiryū Inoue, Eikoh Hosoe, Shōmei Tōmatsu, William Klein, Andy Warhol, Yukio Mishima, and Shūji Terayama.

The Shinjuku area is frequent setting for Moriyama&#x27;s images of urban life. The photographer cites Shinjuku&#x27;s shadowy, labyrinthine streets and alleys as a source of inspiration and allure, describing the area as having &quot;a strange narcotic effect...something about it that traps me and puts me under a spell.&quot;

=== Format ===
Moriyama predominantly presents his work in the form of photobooks (and self-published photo magazines), which he describes as open-ended sites, allowing the reader to decide on the sequence of images that they view. Since 1968, he has published more than 150 photobooks. The photobook arose as a popular format in the 1950s and 60s, and were often produced at a small scale and disseminated through bookstores and localized political networks rather than being mass-produced by major publishing houses.

Since the 2000s he has a preference for having a third party work on the formatting and recomposition of the images, as it frees him from the influences of his own memory and filters the images through the eye of an outsider. A collection of Moriyama&#x27;s writings, compiled from a fifteen-part series published in &quot;Asahi Camera&quot; beginning in 1983, have been published as an autobiographical photobook titled &quot;Inu no kioku&quot; (&quot;Memories of a Dog&quot;).

Moriyama&#x27;s photographs are often captured in a 4:5 aspect ratio rather than the 3:2 ratio associated with the 35 mm format, and he has at times cropped his 35 mm photographs in order to achieve his preferred vertical format.

=== Technique ===
Moriyama tends to capture images without looking through the viewfinder, so as to separate himself from the detached, scientific, and deliberate cropping produced by the viewfinder lens. He often takes a large volume of photographs of the world as it passes by him, embracing the uncertainty and indeterminacy of encountering the scenes as they reveal themselves during the development process.

=== Color and digital work ===
While Moriyama is most recognized for his black-and-white film photography, he has been shooting with color since the 1970s, and since the late 2000s has turned increasingly to compact digital photography, now working almost exclusively in this medium. From time to time, he has also shot Polaroid images, which he treats as &quot;tiles&quot; in installation settings, exhibiting them in groups rather than as discrete photographs.

In 1970, he helped produce the Asahi Journal&#x27;s new color photography series &quot;Dai go shōgen&quot; (&quot;The Fifth Quadrant&quot;) and published photo essays on new development projects in Osaka and Tokyo, cherry blossoms in Osaka, and American military base towns in the Kantō region. These projects employed his unconventional framing styles along with white balance and color exposure distortions that enhanced the uncanny, unsettling features of the world around him.

Due to his tendency to take a large number of shots when photographing, Moriyama finds the digital format more amenable to his needs, and rejects critics who fixate on the preciousness of film photography. In response to a question posted by writer Takeshi Nakamoto&#x27;s regarding Moriyama&#x27;s advice for beginner street photographers, Moriyama states, &quot;Get outside. It’s all about getting out and walking. That’s the first thing. The second thing is, forget everything you’ve learned on the subject of photography for the moment, and just shoot. Take photographs—of anything and everything, whatever catches your eye. Don’t pause to think.&quot;

&quot;Daido Tokyo&quot; at Fondation Cartier pour l’art Contemporain, Paris in 2016 was the first major solo show to display his color photographs. Between 2008 and 2015, Moriyama revisited Tokyo, with a focus on the Shinjuku district—where much of his early career was spent—to take 86 chromogenic prints (&quot;Tokyo Colour&quot; series, 2008–2015) and black-and-white photographs (&quot;Dog and Mesh Tights,&quot; 2014–2015).

== Exhibitions ==
Moriyama&#x27;s work has been not often but consistently featured in group and solo exhibitions in Japan since the mid-1970s, usually about two solo shows per year with his first in 1970 titled &quot;Scandal.&quot; With the series called &quot;Pantomime&quot; he had his debut in 1968 together with Shin Yanagisawa at Ginza Nikon Salon in Tokyo where he was exhibited again several times over the following years, while he showed his work at the &quot;Image Shop Camp,&quot; too.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography/solo exhibitions&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 the &quot;Printing Show&quot; took place at Shimuzu Gallery in Tokyo. Instead of photographs on the walls Moriyama printed a series of his photographs on a photocopy machine, shuffled them and then were staple-bound with silkscreened cover (visitors could choose between two), resulting in the photobook titled &quot;Another Country.&quot; (The event was restaged in 2011 at Aperture Gallery in New York and the following year at the Tate Modern in London.)

Moriyama rose to prominence in the States after being heavily featured in the landmark group exhibition &quot;New Japanese Photography&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art in 1974, curated by John Szarkowski and Shoji Yamagishi. Selected as one of thirteen photographers in the show, Moriyama brought a grittier edge that emphasized the rawness of visual encounter, as well as a youthful perspective to the collection of artists, which included older practitioners such as Ken Domon and Shigeru Tamura, avant-garde contemporaries (and mentors to Moriyama) such as Shomei Tomatsu and Eikoh Hosoe, as well as those working in more polished, intellectualized, and observational approaches such as Ken Ohara, Ryoji Akiyama, and Bishin Jumonji.

In terms of solo exhibitions he was not recognized elsewhere until the mid-1990s; only a single show took place outside Japan, namely in Austrian Graz in 1980 (after a group show of contemporary Japanese photography in 1977). Since then the interest has accelerated and lead to a number of major retrospectives. Beginning with the seminal 1999 retrospective exhibition &quot;Daido Moriyama: Stray Dog&quot; at San Francisco Museum of Modern Art curated by Sandra S. Phillips, that subsequently travelled to New York, Cambridge, and San Diego, as well as Switzerland and Germany. It was followed in 2003 by a retrospective that travelled through Japan and a first exhibition at the Fondation Cartier pour l&#x27;art contemporain in Paris, where a follow-up was organized in 2016 (&quot;Daido Tokyo&quot;), for which he was commissioned to create an &quot;immersive&quot; multiscreen projection of black-and-white photographs (&quot;Dog and Mesh Tights&quot;). Another major show travelled in 2007 from Cologne, Germany, to Seville, Spain and finally to the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography. 2012 saw two institutional exhibitions at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Tate Modern (with William Klein).

<text>In Modern English, the word &quot;you&quot; is the second-person pronoun. It is grammatically plural, and was historically used only for the dative case, but in most modern dialects is used for all cases and numbers.

== History ==
&quot;You&quot; comes from the Proto-Germanic demonstrative base , from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;&quot; (second-person plural pronoun). Old English had singular, dual, and plural second-person pronouns. The dual form was lost by the twelfth century, and the singular form was lost by the early 1600s. The development is shown in the following table.

Early Modern English distinguished between the plural &#x27; and the singular &#x27;. As in many other European languages, English at the time had a T–V distinction, which made the plural forms more respectful and deferential; they were used to address strangers and social superiors. This distinction ultimately led to familiar &quot;thou&quot; becoming obsolete in modern English, although it persists in some English dialects.

&quot;Yourself&quot; had developed by the early 14th century, with the plural &quot;yourselves&quot; attested from 1520.

== Morphology ==
In Standard Modern English, &quot;you&quot; has five shapes representing six distinct word forms:
* &quot;you&quot;: the nominative (subjective) and accusative (objective or oblique case) forms
* &quot;your:&quot; the dependent genitive (possessive) form
* &quot;yours&quot;: the independent genitive (possessive) form
* &quot;yourselves&quot;: the plural reflexive and intensive (emphatic) form
* &quot;yourself&quot;: the singular reflexive and intensive (emphatic) form

===Plural forms from other varieties===
Although there is some dialectal retention of the original plural &quot;ye&quot; and the original singular &quot;thou&quot;, most English-speaking groups have lost the original forms. Because of the loss of the original singular-plural distinction, many English dialects belonging to this group have innovated new plural forms of the second person pronoun. Examples of such pronouns sometimes seen and heard include:
* &quot;y&#x27;all&quot;, or &quot;you all&quot; – southern United States, African-American Vernacular English, the Abaco Islands, St. Helena and Tristan da Cunha. &quot;Y&#x27;all&quot; however, is also occasionally used for the second-person singular in the North American varieties.
* &quot;&quot; [ju gajz~juɣajz] – United States, particularly in the Midwest, Northeast, South Florida and West Coast; Canada, Australia. Gendered usage varies; for mixed groups, &quot;you guys&quot; is nearly always used. For groups consisting of only women, forms like &quot;you girls&quot; or &quot;you gals&quot; might appear instead, though &quot;you guys&quot; is sometimes used for a group of only women as well.
* &quot;&quot; – United Kingdom, Palmerston Island, Australia
* &quot;you mob&quot; – Australia
* &quot;, all-you&quot; – Caribbean English, Saba
* &quot;a(ll)-yo-dis&quot; – Guyana
* &quot;allyuh&quot; – Trinidad and Tobago
* &quot;among(st)-you&quot; – Carriacou, Grenada, Guyana, Utila
* &quot;&quot; – Barbados
* &quot;yinna&quot; – Bahamas
* &quot;/oona&quot; – Jamaica, Belize, Cayman Islands, Barbados, San Salvador Island
* &quot;&quot; – Ireland, Tyneside, Merseyside, Central Scotland, Australia, Falkland Islands, New Zealand, Philadelphia, parts of the Midwestern US, Cape Breton and rural Canada
* &quot;yous(e) guys&quot; – in the United States, particularly in New York City region, Philadelphia, Northeastern Pennsylvania, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan;
* &quot;you-uns, or yinz&quot; – Western Pennsylvania, the Ozarks, the Appalachians
* &quot;ye, ,&quot; &quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot; – Ireland, Tyneside, Newfoundland and Labrador

== Semantics ==
&quot;You&quot; prototypically refers to the addressee along with zero or more other persons, excluding the speaker. &quot;You&quot; is also used to refer to personified things (e.g., &quot;why won&#x27;t you start?&quot; addressed to a car). &quot;You&quot; is always definite even when it is not specific.

Semantically, &quot;you&quot; is both singular and plural, though syntactically it is almost always plural: i.e. always takes a verb form that originally marked the word as plural, (i.e. &quot;you are&quot;, in common with &quot;we are&quot; and &quot;they are&quot;).

===First person usage===
The practice of referring to oneself as &quot;you&quot;, occasionally known as &quot;tuism&quot;, is common when talking to oneself. It is less common in conversations with others, as it could easily result in confusion. Since English lacks a distinct first person singular imperative mood, &quot;you&quot; and &quot;let&#x27;s&quot; function as substitutes.

===Third person usage===

&quot;You&quot; is used to refer to an indeterminate person, as a more common alternative to the very formal indefinite pronoun &quot;one&quot;. Though this may be semantically third person, for agreement purposes, &quot;you&quot; is always second person.
:Example: &quot;&quot;One&quot; should drink water frequently&quot; or &quot;&quot;You&quot; should drink water frequently&quot;.

== Syntax ==

=== Agreement ===
&quot;You&quot; almost always triggers plural verb agreement, even when it is semantically singular.

=== Functions ===
&quot;You&quot; can appear as a subject, object, determiner or predicative complement. The reflexive form also appears as an adjunct. &quot;You&quot; occasionally appears as a modifier in a noun phrase.
* Subject: &quot;You&#x27;re there&quot;; &quot;your being there&quot;; &quot;you paid for yourself to be there.&quot;
* Object: &quot;I saw you&quot;; &quot;I introduced her to you; You saw yourself.&quot;
* Predicative complement: &quot;The only person there was you; this is yours.&quot;
* Determiner: &quot;I met your friend.&quot;
* Adjunct: &quot;You did it yourself.&quot;
* Modifier: &quot;This sounds like a you problem.&quot;

=== Dependents ===
Pronouns rarely take dependents, but it is possible for &quot;you&quot; to have many of the same kind of dependents as other noun phrases.
* Relative clause modifier: &quot;you who believe&quot;
* Determiner: &quot;the real you&quot;; &quot;*the you&quot;
* Adjective phrase modifier: &quot;the real you&quot;; &quot;*real you&quot;
* Adverb phrase external modifier: &quot;Not even you&quot;

* English personal pronouns
* Thou
* Y&#x27;all
* Yinz

<doc id="464910" wikidata="Q1208595" url="?curid=464910" title="Diamond knot">
<text>The diamond knot (or knife lanyard knot) is a knot for forming a decorative loop on the end of a cord such as on a lanyard. A similar knot, also called the diamond knot, is a multistrand stopper knot, that is similar in appearance (although the footrope knot is really more similar, but it is simply an upside down diamond knot). Some people recommend calling this knot the knife lanyard knot in order to avoid confusion. This knot is a four strand diamond knot implemented in two strands. The knife lanyard knot and Chinese button knot are &quot;tied alike, but they are worked differently.&quot; This knot is also used in Prayer ropes by Eastern Christians, who accredit the knot&#x27;s creation to a legend relating to Saint Anthony the Great.

==Tying==
The diamond knot begins as a Carrick bend with the ends exiting diagonally opposite each other. When the steps below are completed the knot is rearranged and tightened so that the ends emerge from the knot parallel and opposite their own standing part. A Chinese button knot is often tied in a very similar manner, but without leaving a loop at the end.

<doc id="464916" wikidata="Q1706646" url="?curid=464916" title="Joseph Bologna">
<text>Joseph Bologna (December 30, 1934 – August 13, 2017) was an American actor, playwright and screenwriter notable for his roles in the comedy films &quot;My Favorite Year&quot;, &quot;Blame It on Rio&quot;, and &quot;Transylvania 6-5000&quot;.

==Life and career==
Bologna was born in the Parkville section of Brooklyn, New York to an Italian-American family. He attended St. Rose of Lima school and Brown University, where he majored in art history. Bologna served with the United States Marine Corps. Bologna was hired to produce and direct Manhattan-based TV commercials.

Bologna enjoyed a long run in film and television. His breakthrough film &quot;Lovers and Other Strangers&quot; adapted with his wife Renée Taylor from a play they co-wrote, was based on the true-life circumstances of organizing a wedding on short notice with the involvement of his Italian extended family and her Jewish clan. Several relatives performed as extras in the final cut. The couple shared an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. A year later, in 1971, the couple again collaborated to write and perform in the film &quot;Made for Each Other&quot;.

Bologna stayed close with his old-neighborhood aunts and uncles after becoming successful. Two of them were slightly famous on their own: His Uncle Pat was Blacky the Bootblack, whom Joseph Kennedy credited as his main influence when he sold all of his stock holdings in the summer of 1929 (the market crashed in October); his aunt Pauline was one of the better-known celebrity chefs, working for Jackie Gleason, Burt Reynolds and others.

Bologna&#x27;s aunt Pauline chastised him for starring in &quot;Blame It on Rio&quot; (starring Michael Caine), which contained some nudity; Bologna remarked &quot;Blame it on me. It&#x27;s the last time I invite Aunt Pauline to a film premiere.&quot; In 1976, he starred in the television drama &quot;What Now, Catherine Curtis?&quot; with Lucille Ball. Other film roles for Bologna include: 
* playing the brother of James Caan&#x27;s widowed protagonist in Neil Simon&#x27;s 1979 romance &quot;Chapter Two&quot;
* portraying the Sid Caesar-based character King Kaiser in the 1982 comedy hit &quot;My Favorite Year&quot; (which starred Peter O&#x27;Toole in the role of drunken film star Alan Swann, modeled after Errol Flynn)
* as Lenny Koufax, the frustrated father of perpetual slacker Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler) in the 1999 comedy &quot;Big Daddy&quot;

In 1987, Bologna starred in the TV musical sitcom &quot;Rags to Riches&quot; as Nick Foley, a millionaire mogul turned adoptive father.

He played the mad scientist Dr. Malavaqua in the 1985 comedy &quot;Transylvania 6-5000&quot;.

From 1996 to 1998, Bologna voiced Inspector Dan Turpin in &quot;&quot;. In 2006, he voiced Mr. Start in &quot;Ice Age: The Meltdown&quot;.

He and his wife Renée Taylor had a son Gabriel. Gabriel became an actor, writer and director, and directed his father in his last film, &quot;Tango Shalom&quot;. Taylor and Bologna starred together on stage and on television. Bologna played a love interest for his wife in the episode &quot;Maternal Affairs&quot; of the sitcom &quot;The Nanny&quot; in the sixth and final season, in which Taylor plays Sylvia, the mother of Fran Drescher&#x27;s character. He also appeared in the first-season episode &quot;The Gym Teacher&quot; as a famous actor for whom Maxwell Sheffield once interned.

From 2012 until before his death in 2017, Bologna appeared in numerous roles on TV and in motion pictures, including roles on &quot;Funny or Die&quot;, stage productions, and national commercials.

In 2017, Bologna received the Night of 100 Stars Oscar Gala Lifetime Achievement Award from actor comedian Richard Lewis and his peers to celebrate his 60-year career and to recognize his efforts to save the Motion Picture Home and Hospital in 2012.

==Death==
Bologna died on August 13, 2017, at City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California from pancreatic cancer at age 82.

<doc id="464921" wikidata="Q858689" url="?curid=464921" title="Federal Hall">
<text>Federal Hall is a memorial and historic site at 26 Wall Street in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City. The current Greek Revival–style building, completed in 1842 as the Custom House, is owned by the United States federal government and operated by the National Park Service as a national memorial called the Federal Hall National Memorial. The memorial is named for an earlier Federal style building on this same site, completed in 1703 as City Hall, which the government of the newly independent United States used as its capital building and called Federal Hall during the 1780s.

The 1703 building had served as New York&#x27;s City Hall and hosted the 1765 Stamp Act Congress before the American Revolution. After the United States became an independent nation, it served as the meeting place for the Congress of the Confederation, the nation&#x27;s first central government under the Articles of Confederation, from 1785 to 1789, and the building was expanded and updated. With the establishment of the United States federal government in 1789, it hosted the 1st Congress and was where George Washington was sworn in as the nation&#x27;s first president. It was demolished in 1812 to make way for another government building.

The current structure, designed by Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis, was built as the U.S. Custom House for the Port of New York before serving as a Subtreasury building from 1862 to 1925. The current national memorial commemorates the historic events that occurred at the previous structure. The memorial building is constructed of Tuckahoe marble. Its architectural features include a colonnade of Doric columns, as well as a domed rotunda designed by the sculptor John Frazee. The facade and part of the interior are New York City designated landmarks, and the building is also a contributing property to the Wall Street Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== First structure ==

In the 17th century, the area north of Wall Street was occupied by John Damen&#x27;s farm. Damen sold the land in 1685 to captain John Knight, an officer of Thomas Dongan&#x27;s administration. Knight resold the land to Dongan, and Dongan resold it in 1689 to Abraham de Peyster and Nicholas Bayard. Both de Peyster and Bayard served as Mayors of New York.

===City Hall===

The original structure on the site was built as New York&#x27;s second City Hall from 1699 to 1703, on Wall Street, in what is today the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. This structure had been designed by James Evetts to replace Stadt Huys, the city&#x27;s first administrative center. It measured two stories high, with wings extending west and east. The stones from Wall Street&#x27;s old fortifications were used for City Hall. Also housed at City Hall was a public library (which had 1,642 volumes by the year 1730), as well as a firehouse with two fire engines imported from London. The upper stories were used as a debtors&#x27; prison.

In 1735, John Peter Zenger, an American newspaper publisher, was arrested for committing libel against the British royal governor and was imprisoned and tried there. His acquittal on the grounds that the material he had printed was true established freedom of the press as it was later defined in the Bill of Rights.

City Hall was first remodeled in 1765, when a third story was added. That October, delegates from nine of the Thirteen Colonies met as the Stamp Act Congress in response to the levying of the Stamp Act by the Parliament of Great Britain. Drawn together for the first time in organized opposition to British policy, the attendees drafted a message to King George III, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons, claiming entitlement to the same rights as the residents of Britain and protesting the colonies&#x27; &quot;taxation without representation&quot;. The Sons of Liberty took over the building from the British during the American Revolutionary War in 1775. Afterward, City Hall served as the meeting place for the Continental Congress.

===Federal Hall===

After the American Revolution, City Hall was home to the Congress of the Confederation of the United States under the Articles of Confederation. The first meeting of the Confederation Congress took place at City Hall on April 13, 1784.

==== Design and construction ====
The Congress of the Confederation still needed a permanent structure, and the New York City Council and mayor James Duane wished for the city to be the United States capital. Private citizens and the government of New York City contributed $65,000 toward the renovation of the old City Hall. The Patriots felt that the building should be remodeled in a distinctively American architectural style while also preserving the pre-colonial structure. Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant, a French architect who had helped the Americans during the Revolutionary War, was selected to remodel the structure.

L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s expansion was characteristic of Georgian-style designs, although he used larger proportions, and added American motifs. An arched promenade was built through the street-level basement, with four heavy Tuscan columns supporting a balcony. On balcony level, four high Doric columns were installed, supporting a pediment that depicted an American eagle with thirteen arrows (one for each of the original Thirteen Colonies). L&#x27;Enfant also created a recessed gallery behind the columns, and he placed decorative swags above the second-story windows. The ground-story room for the United States House of Representatives measured across and about two stories high. A smaller room for the United States Senate was on the second floor. L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s design influenced the development of what later became the Federal style.

==== Usage ====

The city moved all of its municipal offices out of the building in late 1788, but the New York Society Library&#x27;s 3,500-volume library remained in the building for the time being. Work progressed quickly between September 1788 and March 1789. The building was renamed Federal Hall in 1789 when New York was chosen as the nation&#x27;s first seat of government under the Constitution. The 1st Congress met there beginning on March 4, 1789. The first inauguration of George Washington, the first-ever inauguration of a President of the United States, occurred on the balcony of the building on April 30, 1789. Many of the most important legislative actions in the United States occurred with the 1st Congress at Federal Hall. For example, on September 25, 1789, the United States Bill of Rights was proposed in Federal Hall, establishing the freedoms claimed by the 1765 Stamp Act Congress. The Judiciary Act of 1789 was also enacted in the building, setting up the United States federal court system.

In 1790, the United States capital moved to Philadelphia. What had been Federal Hall was turned into quarters for the state assembly and courts. The Federal Hall building was one of the few structures in the area to survive an 1804 fire that caused $2 million in damage (equivalent to $ million in ). With the opening of the current New York City Hall in 1812, the New York City government no longer needed Federal Hall, and the building was demolished. Part of the original railing and balcony floor, where Washington had been inaugurated, is on display in the memorial and was at one point held by the New-York Historical Society. Nassau Street had originally curved around the building to the west, while Broad Street had run to the east. Nassau Street was straightened after the building was demolished, and it runs to the west of the modern Federal Hall National Memorial.

==Second structure==
The current Greek Revival structure was the first building that was specifically constructed for the U.S. Custom House for the Port of New York. The Custom House previously had been located in Government House, a converted residence on Bowling Green. The old building was described as &quot;ordinary and inconvenient&quot;, and it had become overcrowded, prompting the federal government to lease additional space in 1831. Samuel Swartwout, the Customs Collector for the Port of New York, advocated in 1832 for &quot;spacious, safe, secure&quot; accommodations. Land for the new building had been purchased incrementally in 1816, 1824, and 1832.

=== Custom House ===
The firm of Town and Davis, composed of Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis, won an architectural design competition for the new Custom House building and was awarded the contract for the building&#x27;s design in August 1833. Town estimated that the plans would cost $250,000 if the Custom House building was made of granite, or $320,000 to $350,000 if it was of masonry, brick, and marble. The original design called for a colonnade of eight columns facing Wall and Pine Streets, square pilasters on Nassau Street, a massive coffered dome protruding above the roof, and a cruciform floor plan. The building would have also been decorated with details such as acroteria, metopes, and triangular pediments. Town suggested that Samuel Thomson, architect of the Administration Building at Sailors&#x27; Snug Harbor, be named the construction superintendent.

Work on the Custom House began in January 1834, but the Customs Service then requested that the plans for the new building be downsized due to increasing costs. As a result, the dome was reduced in size and the original double colonnade on the facade was changed to a single colonnade. Thomson resigned in April 1835, taking the plans with him. Sculptor John Frazee was named the superintendent in Thomson&#x27;s stead; he worked to piece together Town and Davis&#x27;s original plans. Frazee influenced the design of the interior and decorative details, and he modified plans for the attic to a full-height third story. Frazee got into a dispute with building commissioner Walter Bowne and was dismissed in 1840, although he was rehired in 1841.

The Custom House building opened in 1842 at a cost of $928,312 (equivalent to $ million in ). Importers would perform their business at a counter in the building&#x27;s central rotunda. The building came to be associated with political patronage. &quot;The Seven Stages of the Office Seeker&quot;, an 1852 print by Edward Williams Clay, satirized how Democratic Party patronage under New York governor Martin Van Buren was centered around the Custom House. By 1861, the structure had become too small to accommodate all of the customs duties of the U.S. Custom House for the Port of New York. The U.S. government decided to move the customs offices one block to 55 Wall Street, then occupied by the Merchants&#x27; Exchange. The federal government of the United States signed a lease with the Merchants&#x27; Exchange in February 1862, intending to move into the building that May. The customs offices were moved to 55 Wall Street starting in August 1862.

=== Subtreasury ===
After the relocation of the Custom House, 26 Wall Street was transformed into a building for the United States Subtreasury. The Subtreasury desks were arranged around the rotunda of the building. Gold and coin storage vaults were placed along a passage near the north side of the rotunda. Bars were stored to the west, or left, and gold certificates and coins were stored to the east, or right. A vault for small change was also provided. A coin division was on the east side of the building, on the floor of the rotunda, toward Pine Street. Silver was stored in the northwest corner of the building, in the basement. An armory was placed on the upper stories, and various fortifications were mounted at the top of the building to protect the money. Adjoining the Subtreasury to the east was the United States Assay Office, a branch of the United States Mint that performed all Mint functions except creating the coinage. At its peak, the Subtreasury building held seventy percent of the federal government&#x27;s money.

In 1883, John Quincy Adams Ward&#x27;s bronze statue of George Washington was put up on the Subtreasury&#x27;s ceremonial front steps. The statue &quot;mark[ed] the exact height Washington stood when taking the oath of office on the balcony&quot; of the eighteenth-century edifice, overlooking the crowds filling Broad Street up to Wall Street. By 1903, the building held over $275 million in gold, silver, and various other types of money; this amounted to nearly one-tenth of all of the United States&#x27; money at that point. A plaque memorializing the Northwest Ordinance was dedicated at the Subtreasury in 1905.

By 1917, the Subtreasury building held $519 million worth of gold and several million dollars more in coins. In the Wall Street bombing of 1920, a bomb was detonated across from the Subtreasury at 23 Wall Street, in what became known as The Corner. Thirty-eight people were killed and 400 injured, though the Subtreasury was undamaged.

The Federal Reserve Bank replaced the Subtreasury system in 1920, and the Subtreasury office closed on December 7 of that year. The Assay Office leased the Subtreasury building to the Fed, which was constructing a building of its own, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Building, two blocks north. The Fed started moving its monetary holdings from the Subtreasury to the new Fed building in May 1924. This prompted concern among local financiers that the federal government was planning to sell the building to a private entity. That July, nationalist group American Defense Society started advocating against a possible sale of the building.

=== Use by other government offices ===

Ultimately, the government decided to retain ownership of the Subtreasury, using it as storage space for the Assay Office and as office space for other agencies. The government also considered moving the Bureau of Internal Revenue to the Subtreasury. In October 1924, federal officials announced they would move Prohibition enforcement agents&#x27; offices to the Subtreasury building, using the basement vaults to store confiscated alcoholic beverages. These plans were canceled the next month because of opposition from patriotic and historical societies. In early 1925, the City Club of New York appealed to Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon to preserve the Subtreasury building. U.S. representative Anning Smith Prall proposed a bill that December to allocate $5 million for an expansion of the Subtreasury building.

A passport office opened on the Pine Street side of the building in March 1925. The Subtreasury was also used for events such as a 1926 party to celebrate the dedication of the Bowling Green Community House, as well as Constitution Day celebrations. The Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) built its Nassau Street Line under the building in the late 1920s, and the Subtreasury was underpinned during the line&#x27;s construction. The original foundation was only deep, so additional supports were installed underneath, descending to the bedrock. Both houses of Congress passed legislation allowing the BMT line to be built slightly underneath the building. A water main under Nassau Street ruptured in October 1931, severely damaging some of the records that were stored in the basement.

A writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1930 characterized the Subtreasury as one of &quot;the big little buildings of Wall Street&quot;, along with 23 Wall Street, the New York Stock Exchange Building, and Trinity Church. In the early 1930s, the United States Post Office Department proposed replacing the Subtreasury building with a post office, which would be a replica of Federal Hall as it appeared in 1789. At the time, the three post-office substations in Lower Manhattan could not adequately accommodate high demand from the surrounding office buildings. The department said much of the Subtreasury&#x27;s space was unused because historical and patriotic societies had objected to most plans for the building. The Subtreasury continued to be used as a passport office through the mid-1930s.

===Federal Hall National Memorial===
==== 1930s to 1950s ====

In 1939, after the government announced plans to demolish the Subtreasury building, a group called Federal Hall Memorial Associates raised money to prevent the building&#x27;s demolition. On April 29, 1939, Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes announced that the Subtreasury would become a historic site. The building was designated as Federal Hall Memorial National Historic Site on May 26, 1939, and an information bureau opened on the rotunda floor, with exhibits related to finance and the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The next month, the National Park Service (NPS) took over the Subtreasury building. The memorial commemorated the first building on the site, rather than the extant Subtreasury building. Due to the building&#x27;s status as a &quot;national shrine&quot;, it did not accommodate governmental offices. After several months of negotiations, Federal Hall Memorial Associates was allowed to operate the interior as a museum in January 1940. The memorial opened on Washington&#x27;s Birthday, February 22, 1940. The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; said that, within the United States, Federal Hall Memorial was only matched by Mount Vernon and Independence Hall &quot;in historical interest&quot;.

The building celebrated its 100th anniversary on Washington&#x27;s Birthday in 1942. Among the other events that took place at Federal Hall Memorial in the early 1940s were sales of World War II war bonds, Constitution Day celebrations, rallies in support of the United Service Organizations, and stamp sales. Federal Hall Memorial continued to be used for events in the 1950s, including a blood donation drive and a Salvation Army donation drive. In 1952, the United States House of Representatives&#x27; Subcommittee of the Interior voted to permit the rehabilitation of Federal Hall. The John Peter Zenger Room, a journalism exhibit, was dedicated at Federal Hall in April 1953. The next year, the U.S. government relocated the building&#x27;s original wrought-iron fence into the basement because the Tennessee marble under it had started to buckle.

As the building is owned by the federal government and managed by the NPS, renovations and restoration proposals must be approved by Congress. In 1954, the New York City Council passed a resolution asking Congress to establish a committee to provide suggestions for restoring Federal Hall, the Castle Clinton National Monument, and the Statue of Liberty National Monument. Federal Hall was re-designated as a national memorial on August 11, 1955. The same year, the federal government created the New York City National Shrines Advisory Board. The board first convened in February 1956. The government tentatively allocated $1.621 million for the restoration of Federal Hall, whose interior had become dilapidated. In February 1957, the board recommended allocating $3 million for the restoration of the three sites. By 1960, Interior Secretary Fred A. Seaton announced plans to restore Federal Hall within the next two years. He proposed that local civic groups raise $2.9 million, half of the projected cost, and that the government raise matching funds. The next year, Interior Secretary Stewart Udall announced that the federal government would start redeveloping the three historic sites in advance of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Federal government officials also installed a plaque in front of the building, dedicating it as a &quot;national shrine&quot;.

==== 1960s to 1990s ====

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the building&#x27;s exterior as a landmark on December 21, 1965. The building was also added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on October 15, 1966, the day the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 was signed. The building&#x27;s location on Wall Street, and near the New York Stock Exchange Building, made it a &quot;natural rallying place&quot; as &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it. As a result, its front steps were used for demonstrations, political rallies, President&#x27;s Day celebrations, and union drives. After the building closed for restoration in 1968, the NPS said that loitering on the front steps developed into &quot;more of a problem&quot;. Among these events were an anti-narcotics rally and a protest against the Vietnam War in 1970.

The building reopened to the public in 1972 as a museum. That year, the New York City Bicentennial Corporation issued a commemorative medal honoring the original Federal Hall, as well as New York City during the American Revolution. The LPC held hearings in 1975 to determine whether the interiors of Federal Hall&#x27;s rotunda, the Morris–Jumel Mansion, and the Bartow–Pell Mansion should be designated as landmarks. The LPC designated all three buildings&#x27; interiors as landmarks on May 26, 1975, and the New York City Board of Estimate ratified these designations that July. The NPS hired Phoebe Dent Weil to restore the George Washington statue on the front steps in 1978.

The Whitney Museum opened a temporary branch at Federal Hall in 1982. This was actually the third location of the Whitney&#x27;s first satellite branch, which had previously been housed at 55 Water Street and the First Police Precinct Station House. The satellite branch occupied four galleries on the mezzanine of Federal Hall (around the central rotunda), while the NPS hosted history exhibits in other parts of the building. The Whitney closed the Federal Hall branch in 1984, eventually reopening at 33 Maiden Lane in 1988. During this decade, Richard Jenrettethe chairman of banking house Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, which was headquartered nearbystarted soliciting $500,000 in private donations to renovate Federal Hall, in conjunction with Federal Hall Memorial Associates. Although the group planned to renovate the rotunda into a reception area with contemporary furnishings, by 1985, only $73.000 had been raised and no contemporary furnishings had been acquired.

Federal officials announced in 1986 that Federal Hall would be renovated; the spaces would be cleaned and painted, and mechanical systems would be replaced. The memorial&#x27;s second floor would contain two galleries about the Constitution of the United States, and an exhibit about the original building would be installed as well. Federal Hall hosted a reenactment of Washington&#x27;s inauguration on April 30, 1989, the event&#x27;s 200th anniversary. The reenactment, attended by U.S. president George Bush, was intended to raise $700,000 for the museum, which opened to the public after this event. In addition to Constitution-related exhibits, the museum hosted temporary exhibits such as a display of Hudson Valley artwork, a showcase of New York City designated landmarks, and an exhibit about the abolition of slavery in the United States.

==== 2000s to present ====
By the beginning of the 21st century, Federal Hall contained numerous large cracks. During the September 11, 2001, attacks, which caused the nearby collapse of the World Trade Center&#x27;s Twin Towers, 300 people sheltered at the memorial. Due to concerns over the building&#x27;s structural integrity, Federal Hall was closed for one month following the attacks. When the building reopened, metal detectors similar to those at airports were placed at the entrances. Meanwhile, the cracks in the building were exacerbated following the collapse of the World Trade Center. As a result, in early 2002, the NPS received $16.5 million for repairs to the building. On September 6, 2002, approximately 300 members of Congress traveled from Washington, D.C. to New York to convene in Federal Hall National Memorial as a symbolic show of support for the city; this was the first meeting of Congress in New York since 1790. Four steel pilings were installed under one of the building&#x27;s corners in 2003 after investigators found a 24-inch air gap beneath that corner.

The site closed on December 3, 2004, for a $16 million renovation, mostly to its foundation. Federal Hall National Memorial reopened in late 2006. The renovated memorial included a visitor center, showcasing other historical sites operated by the NPS in the New York City area. In 2007, the building was designated as a contributing property to the Wall Street Historic District, a NRHP district. The same year, the metal detectors were removed and replaced with magnetometers because the security screening process took too long, driving away many visitors. This measure increased attendance fourfold. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and ABC News invited the 2008 United States presidential candidates, John McCain and Barack Obama, to a town hall forum at Federal Hall, though both candidates declined the offer. McCain did host his own town hall forum at Federal Hall in June 2008.

The American Express Foundation donated $75,000 in 2012 toward the restoration of the Washington statue outside the building. In 2015, the National Trust for Historic Preservation said Federal Hall&#x27;s grand staircase would be renovated after the American Express Foundation had given a $300,000 grant. At the time, the steps had begun to fall into disrepair and showed signs of spalling and cracking. The work was to begin in late 2016. By 2018, local newspaper &quot;AM New York Metro&quot; wrote that &quot;cracked walls, peeling paint and a rust-water-stained rotunda are among the deteriorating conditions that greet nearly 300,000 visitors who come there to learn about American history.&quot; Federal Hall National Memorial also had damaged floors and arches; the facade had begun to chip; and the columns had cracked and were showing signs of mold and discoloration. The cooling system was replaced in 2020. The NPS temporarily closed the memorial in July 2021 after finding cracked stone. As part of a permanent repair project, the building was to be covered in scaffolding for five to ten years.

== Architecture ==
Federal Hall National Memorial was designed by architects Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis of Town and Davis, with a domed rotunda designed by the sculptor John Frazee. The building is constructed of Tuckahoe marble. Two prominent American ideals are reflected in the current building&#x27;s Greek Revival architecture. Town and Davis&#x27;s Doric columns on the facade resemble those of the Parthenon and serve as a tribute to the democracy of the Greeks. Frazee&#x27;s domed rotunda echoes the Pantheon and is evocative of the republican ideals of the ancient Romans.

The building contains two basement levels, three full above-ground stories, and an attic. The Subtreasury had been constructed with 22 or 25 rooms.

=== Facade ===
The facade of the building is made of marble blocks measuring thick. A set of 18 granite steps lead from ground level up to the rotunda. John Quincy Adams Ward&#x27;s bronze statue of George Washington is placed on the building&#x27;s ceremonial front steps. At the top of the stairs, a colonnade supports a plain triangular pediment. The lack of sculpture on the pediment may have been influenced by aesthetic considerations, as there were few &quot;qualified sculptors&quot; at the time of the building&#x27;s construction, according to Elizabeth Macaulay-Lewis.

Next to the building&#x27;s western elevation, there was originally a wrought-iron fence about tall and long; it rested on a parapet of Tennessee marble measuring tall. The fence, which was placed about in front of the building, was removed in 1954. When the building was used by the Subtreasury, guards were stationed in three turrets on the roof. These turrets contained grilles through which the guards could fire at invaders. There are also flat pilasters on the western facade, along Nassau Street.

=== Rotunda ===

The main rotunda of Federal Hall is in diameter. The rotunda is designed as an amphiprostyle: it has balconies on four sides, but it lacks columns between each balcony. The wall of the rotunda contains four sections of colonnade, each containing four columns. The columns each measure high and across. The southern colonnade leads to the main entrance, while the northern colonnade leads to the primary hallway of the building. The outer walls of the eastern and western colonnades contain plainly designed windows. There are gilded-iron balconies behind each colonnade. Between the colonnades are short sections of flat wall, situated between flat pilasters. The pilasters measure high. Above the balconies are barrel vaulted ceilings. The rotunda had contained four Carrara-marble counters when it was used as the Custom House.

The rotunda is topped by a self-supporting masonry saucer dome with a skylight at its center. The dome contains narrow panels with curved bottoms, as well as anthemion motifs at their top and bottom ends. The skylight is surrounded by raised rosettes. The decorations were originally in a gold, blue, and white color scheme. The floor of the rotunda contains gray and cream marble blocks in concentric circles. At the center of the floor is a stone slab, where George Washington once stood.

== Activities ==
The National Park Service operates Federal Hall as a national memorial. The memorial has tourist information about the New York Harbor area&#x27;s federal monuments and parks, and a New York City tourism information center. The gift shop has colonial and early American items for sale. Normally its exhibit galleries are open free to the public daily, except national holidays, and guided tours of the site are offered throughout the day.

The memorial has several permanent exhibits. These include &quot;George Washington&#x27;s Inauguration Gallery&quot;, including the Bible used to swear his oath of office; &quot;Freedom of the Press&quot;, the imprisonment and trial of John Peter Zenger; and &quot;New York: An American Capital&quot;, preview exhibit created by the National Archives and Records Administration. Among the items displayed are a piece of the balcony upon which Washington stood in his first inauguration. Various temporary exhibitions have also been shown at Federal Hall. For instance, in 2023 the building hosted a site-specific theatre performance, &quot; The Democracy Project&quot;.

== Access ==
Federal Hall is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Mondays through Fridays and is closed on weekends. The memorial is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 via a ramp at its rear, on Pine Street. The M55 bus stops nearby on Broadway, while the M15 and M15 SBS stop nearby on Water Street. In addition, the Broad Street station of the New York City Subway, serving the , is directly under Federal Hall.

In 2015, the museum had an estimated 200,000 annual visitors. This was about one percent of the 15 million people who visited the intersection of Wall, Nassau, and Broad Streets every year.

==On U.S. postage==

Engraved renditions of Federal Hall appear on multiple U.S. postage stamps. The first stamp showing Federal Hall was issued on April 30, 1939, the 150th anniversary of President Washington&#x27;s inauguration, where he is depicted on the balcony of Federal Hall taking the oath of office. The second issue was released in 1957, the 200th anniversary of Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s birth. This issue depicts Alexander Hamilton and a full view of Federal Hall.

In addition, in 1988, the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative 25-cent stamp in 1988, the 200th anniversary of when New York ratified the United States Constitution. The stamp depicted the original Federal Hall, Wall Street, and Trinity Church&#x27;s steeple.

<text>François Félix Tisserand (; 13 January 1845 – 20 October 1896) was a French astronomer.

==Life==
Tisserand was born at Nuits-Saint-Georges, Côte-d&#x27;Or. In 1863 he entered the École Normale Supérieure, and on leaving he went for a month as professor at the lycée at Metz. Urbain Le Verrier offered him a post in the Paris Observatory, which he entered as astronome adjoint in September 1866. In 1868 he took his doctor&#x27;s degree with a thesis on Delaunay&#x27;s Method, which he showed to be of much wider scope than had been contemplated by its inventor. Shortly afterwards he went out to Kra Isthmus with Édouard Stephan and Georges Rayet to observe the 1868 solar eclipse. The French astronomers were accompanied by Mongkut, the King of Siam who had calculated the location and the date of the eclipse by himself two years before and prepared a comfortable watching place for the scientists.

In 1873 he was appointed director of the observatory at Toulouse, where he published his &quot;Recueil d&#x27;exercices sur le calcul infinitesimal&quot;, and in 1874 became corresponding member of the Académie des Sciences. He took part in the French expeditions of 1874, accompanied by Jules Janssen, to Japan, and in 1882, accompanied by Guillaume Bigourdan, to Martinique to observe the transits of Venus. In 1878 he was elected a member of the Académie des Sciences in succession to Le Verrier, and became a member of the Bureau des Longitudes. In the same year he was appointed professeur suppliant to Liouville, and in 1883 he succeeded Puiseux in the chair of celestial mechanics at the Sorbonne.

Tisserand always found time to continue his important researches in mathematical astronomy, and the pages of the &quot;Comptes rendus&quot; bear witness to his activity. His writings relate to almost every branch of celestial mechanics, and are always distinguished by rigour and simplicity in the solution of the most difficult problems. He treated in a masterly manner (&quot;Bulletin astronomique&quot;, 1889) the theory of the capture of comets by the larger planets, and in this connection published his valuable &quot;Criterion&quot; for establishing the identity of a periodic comet, whatever may have been the perturbations brought about in its orbit, between successive appearances, by the action of a planet.

His principal work, &quot;Traité de mécanique céleste&quot;, is the most lasting monument to his memory, and is worthy to stand beside the &quot;Mécanique céleste&quot; of his fellow-countryman Laplace. In this treatise, published in four quarto volumes, the last of which appeared only a few months before his death, he fused into one harmonious whole the researches of Laplace and those of other workers in the same field since his time. It furnishes a faithful and complete résumé of the state of knowledge in that department of astronomy at the end, as Laplace&#x27;s great work did for the beginning, of the 19th century.

In 1892 he succeeded Mouchez as director of the Paris Observatory, and as president of the committee of the photographic chart of the heavens he contributed largely to the success of that great project. Under his direction the revision of Lalande&#x27;s catalogue was brought almost to completion, and four volumes of the &quot;Annales de l&#x27;Observatoire de Paris&quot; exhibit the progress made in this important undertaking. He was also editor of the &quot;Bulletin astronomique&quot; from the beginning, and contributed many important articles to its pages. He died suddenly, in the fullness of his power, of congestion of the brain.

He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1892. In 1894 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Tisserand served as President of the Société Astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1893-1895.

The crater Tisserand on the Moon is named after him, as is the asteroid 3663 Tisserand.

<doc id="464928" wikidata="Q1221526" url="?curid=464928" title="Edward Stanley Gibbons">
<text>Edward Stanley Gibbons (21 June 1840 – 17 February 1913) was an English stamp dealer and founder of Stanley Gibbons Ltd, publishers of the Stanley Gibbons stamp catalogue and other stamp-related books and magazines.

==Early life==
Edward Stanley Gibbons was born at his father William Gibbons&#x27; chemists shop at 15 Treville Street, Plymouth, on 21 June 1840, in the same year that the United Kingdom issued the Penny Black, which was the world&#x27;s first postage stamp. Edward’s interest in postage stamps began whilst at Halloran&#x27;s Collegiate School. Gibbons, who was a member of The Plymouth Institution (now The Plymouth Athenaeum), owned a book containing stamps for exchange. These stamps included the Western Australia 1d. black and a 1d. &quot;Sydney View&quot; of New South Wales.

Edward left school at the age of 15 and worked for a short while in the Naval Bank, Plymouth, before joining his father&#x27;s business after the death of his elder brother. William Gibbons encouraged his son&#x27;s hobby and allowed him to set up a stamp desk in the shop.

Between 1861 and 1871 Gibbons was developing his own stamp business, although there is no evidence to suggest that he had advertised prices prior to 1864. In 1867, Edward&#x27;s father died and Edward took over the business. However, by this time he was heavily involved in stamp dealing and the pharmaceutical business his father had left him was sold.

==Stanley Gibbons &amp; Co.==
On 29 January 1872, Edward (also known as Stanley) married Matilda Woon. Two years later, Gibbons decided to move to London to develop his stamp business and relocated to 25 The Chase, Clapham Common (South London). He employed women to tear up sheets of stamps in the evening from this address. Neighbours became curious of the number of women entering the premises and reported it to the local Watch Committee, however they investigated and concluded that nothing unusual was happening there.

Gibbons moved to Gower Street (London) in 1876. Gibbon&#x27;s first wife, Matilda, died on 11 August 1877 in Devon from a wasting disease, marasmus. The Post Office Directory lists the main occupier of the Gower Street property as &#x27;Stanley Gibbons &amp; Co publishers&#x27; or &#x27;Stanley Gibbons &amp; Co postage stamp dealers&#x27;. In 1887, Gibbons married his assistant and housemaid, Margaret Casey and in 1890, sold his business to Charles Phillips of Birmingham for £25,000 and retired. (It had first been offered to Theodor Buhl for £20,000.) In 1891, Phillips opened a shop at 435 The Strand, as well as keeping the office at 8 Gower Street.

In 1892, two years after he had retired from business, Stanley bought the property &quot;Cambridge Villa&quot; in Cambridge Park, East Twickenham. It was an impressive residence in a fashionable area of suburban London, near the banks of the Thames, alongside Marble Hill House (built by George II for one of his mistresses). Gibbons lived there until 1911. The house was demolished in 1960.

==Overseas trips==
During Gibbons&#x27; retirement he made numerous trips overseas, mostly for pleasure, but also for business, buying stamps for his old company. A scrapbook was discovered belonging to either him or someone close to him; it contained photographs and memorabilia. It related mostly to his travels. The scrapbook became divided, half of it is kept in the Society of Genealogists archive and the other half is in private hands.

In 1894, Gibbons witnessed the crash of the Orient Express at Tirnove in Bulgaria. A pencil drawing of the crash appears in his scrap book. A newspaper cutting headed &quot;Honolulu, January&quot; was also found in the scrapbook, referring to a resolution to burn stocks of obsolete Hawaiian stamps. Gibbons was present at the fire and described the experience as &quot;sad&quot;. During this time, he was on his second world tour and was en route to Japan.

Margaret died on 23 November 1899 of cirrhosis and a few years after her death, Gibbons was in Calcutta and Rangoon. The scrapbook contains a duplicate passport issued at Rangoon in December 1901 for a Mrs Gibbons, his third wife, Georgina. In 1903, Gibbons was in Ceylon. The Society of Genealogists archive contains a newspaper article titled &quot;Reminiscences of a Stamp Collector - Mr Stanley Gibbons (sic) in Colombo&quot;. The cutting is not dated, but is presumably from 1903 as it refers to the recent issue of stamps with King Edward VII’s portrait.

When asked around this time if he still collected stamps, Gibbons replied that he had specialised collections in six countries, but rarely bought any stamps because they were too expensive. Further visits seem to have been made to Ceylon judging by the existence in the scrapbook of souvenirs for Colombo Empire Day Celebrations and Edward VII’s Birthday Celebration Dinner in Colombo (November 1906).

==Death==

By 1905, Georgina Gibbons had died, and Stanley married again in October 1905. His fourth wife was Bertha Barth. In 1908, Gibbons was back in Ceylon and in the archives there is a newspaper cutting headed &quot;Death of Lady Visitor to Ceylon: Wife of famous collector&quot;. This refers to Bertha, who had died in the General Hospital there from cancer of the liver at 35 years old.

Gibbons returned to England shortly after the death of his fourth wife. On 16 January 1909, he married Sophia Crofts. However, it is possible that he and Sophia separated before his death in 1913 as his will makes no mention of her. Made in July 1912, from his address, &#x27;Selsey&#x27;, 63 Stanthorpe Road, Streatham, his estate is left to &#x27;a dear friend&#x27;, Mabel Hedgecoe.

Gibbons&#x27; death was recorded on 17 February 1913 at his nephew&#x27;s apartment at Portman Mansions, just off Baker Street, although it was rumoured he had died in the arms of a lover at the Savoy Hotel and was subsequently transported to his nephew&#x27;s house. His death certificate gives his occupation as &quot;A retired Stamp Collector&quot; and the cause was stated as &quot;Coma, Haemorrhage of the Brain, secondary to Extensive Valvular Disease of the Heart with Atheroma of Endocardium and the Blood Vessels accelerated by enlarged prostate&quot;. He is buried in Twickenham cemetery.

Gibbons&#x27; string of wives, all but one of whom died relatively young, his swift remarriages, and his background in pharmacy, have given rise to suspicions of ill-doing on his part, but there is no evidence for that.

<text>Johnny Leartice Robinson (July 25, 1952 – February 4, 2004) was an American criminal executed by the State of Florida for the 1985 murder of Beverly St. George.

==Background, case and execution==

Robinson had faced several criminal charges before being arrested for murder; he was convicted of several previous rapes and was on parole for a rape conviction in Maryland at the time of Beverly St. George&#x27;s murder. On August 11, 1985, Robinson and 16-year-old Clinton Fields were travelling from along I-95 in Florida when they came upon St. George&#x27;s car, which had broken down along the highway.

Robinson took St. George to a nearby cemetery where Robinson claimed that the two had consensual sex on the hood of a car. Prosecutors contended that she was sexually assaulted. St. George was shot twice, but Robinson claimed that the gun &quot;accidentally&quot; fired, hitting her in the face, and that he then shot her again to make sure she was dead, claiming &quot;How do you tell someone I accidentally shot a white woman?&quot; Clinton Fields, Robinson&#x27;s co-defendant, testified at trial that Robinson abducted St. George at gunpoint and had planned to kill her.

Robinson and Fields were arrested several days later following another rape and robbery. Based largely upon Fields&#x27; testimony, Robinson was convicted and sentenced to death in June 1986; Fields was sentenced to life in prison. On appeal, Robinson&#x27;s death sentence was overturned by the Florida Supreme Court; his attorneys contended that questions and statements made by prosecutors amounted to racial bias against Robinson. A second sentencing hearing in 1989 restored the death sentence.

During further appeals, Robinson&#x27;s defense lawyers continued to contend that Robinson was the victim of racial discrimination, that he was abused as a child, and that Fields, with an IQ of 50, was coerced by prosecutors into giving false testimony. (Fields did recant his trial testimony in January 2004.) Final appeals to the United States Supreme Court challenged the process of lethal injection as cruel and unusual punishment.

Robinson was scheduled to be executed at 6:00 p.m. on February 4, 2004, but less than 15 minutes before the scheduled time, the United States Supreme Court contacted the Florida governor&#x27;s office, asking the state to briefly halt the execution; the court returned their decision about an hour later, refusing, on a vote of 5–4, to halt the execution.

Robinson&#x27;s final meal prior to his execution was fried chicken gizzards, french fries, smoked sausage, and butter pecan ice cream. His final words before being executed by lethal injection were: &quot;Yep... Later!&quot; Robinson was pronounced dead at Florida State Prison in Raiford at 7:34 p.m. on February 4, 2004. His execution was the 895th carried out in the United States since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, and the 58th in Florida.

<text>Elk Cloner is one of the first known microcomputer viruses that spread &quot;in the wild&quot;, i.e., outside the computer system or laboratory in which it was written. It attached itself to the Apple II operating system and spread by floppy disk. It was written around 1982 by programmer and entrepreneur Rich Skrenta as a 15-year-old high school student, originally as a joke, and put onto a game disk.

==Infection and symptoms==
Elk Cloner spread by infecting the Apple DOS 3.3 operating system using a technique now known as a boot sector virus. It was attached to a program being shared on a disk (usually a game). At set numbers of times the disk&#x27;s program had been run (all multiples of 5), it would cause various strange behaviors of the Apple II, many requiring a reboot to correct. Most noticeably, every 50th time the program was run, instead of executing normally, it would change to a blank screen that displayed a poem about the virus. If a computer booted from an infected floppy disk, a copy of the virus was placed in the computer&#x27;s memory. When an uninfected disk was inserted into the computer, a modified version of DOS including Elk Cloner would be copied to the disk, allowing it to spread from disk to disk. To prevent the DOS from being continually rewritten each time the disk was accessed, Elk Cloner also wrote a signature byte to the disk&#x27;s directory, indicating that it had already been infected.

The poem that Elk Cloner would display was as follows:

 ELK CLONER:
 THE PROGRAM WITH A PERSONALITY
 IT WILL GET ON ALL YOUR DISKS
 IT WILL INFILTRATE YOUR CHIPS
 YES IT&#x27;S CLONER!
 IT WILL STICK TO YOU LIKE GLUE
 IT WILL MODIFY RAM TOO
 SEND IN THE CLONER!

Elk Cloner did not cause deliberate harm, but Apple DOS disks without a standard image had their reserved tracks overwritten.

==Development==
Elk Cloner was created by Skrenta as a prank in 1982. Skrenta already had a reputation for pranks among his friends. In sharing computer games and software, he would often alter the floppy disks to shut down or display taunting on-screen messages. Due to this reputation, many of his friends simply stopped accepting floppy disks from him. Skrenta thought of methods to alter floppy disks without physically touching or harming them. During a winter break from Mt. Lebanon High School in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, Skrenta discovered how to launch the messages automatically on his Apple II computer. He developed what is now known as a boot sector virus, and began circulating it in early 1982 among high school friends and a local computer club. Twenty-five years later, in 2007, Skrenta called it &quot;some dumb little practical joke.&quot;

==Distribution==
According to contemporary reports, the virus was quite contagious, successfully infecting the floppies of most people Skrenta knew, and upsetting many of them. Skrenta&#x27;s high school math teacher, on encountering the program on his computer, accused Skrenta of breaking into his office.

Part of the &quot;success&quot; was that people were not at all wary of the potential problem, nor were virus scanners or cleaners available. The virus could be removed using Apple&#x27;s MASTER CREATE utility or other utilities to rewrite a fresh copy of DOS to the infected disk. Furthermore, once Elk Cloner was removed, the previously infected disk would not be reinfected since it already contained the Elk Cloner &quot;signature&quot; in its directory. It was also possible to &quot;inoculate&quot; uninfected disks against Elk Cloner by writing the &quot;signature&quot; to the disk; the virus would then think the disk was already infected and refrain from writing itself.

<doc id="464943" wikidata="Q1067753" url="?curid=464943" title="Vinho Verde">
<text>Vinho Verde (; , nonliterally &#x27;young wine&#x27;) refers to Portuguese wine that originated in the historic Minho Province in the far north of the country. The modern-day &#x27;Vinho Verde&#x27; region, originally designated in 1908, includes the old Minho Province plus adjacent areas to the south. In 1976, the old province was dissolved.

Vinho Verde is not a grape variety, it is a DOC for the production of wine. The name means &#x27;green wine&#x27;, but translates as &quot;young wine&quot;, with wine being released three to six months after the grapes are harvested. They may be red, white or rosé, and they are usually consumed soon after bottling. A Vinho Verde can also be a sparkling, a Late Harvest or even Brandy. In its early years of production, the slight effervesce of the wine came from malolactic fermentation taking place in the bottle. In winemaking, this is usually considered a wine fault but Vinho Verde producers found that consumers liked the slightly fizzy nature. However, the wines had to be packaged in opaque bottles to hide the unseemly turbidity and sediment that the &quot;in-bottle MLF&quot; produced. Today, most Vinho Verde producers no longer follow this practice with the slight sparkle being added by artificial carbonation.

The region is characterized by its many small growers, which numbered around 19,000 as of 2014. Many of these growers used to train their vines high off the ground, up trees, fences, and even telephone poles so that they could cultivate vegetable crops below the vines that their families may use as a food source.

==Styles==
The majority of the wines classified as Vinho Verde are white, but the region is also known for the production of red and rose wines. The white Vinho Verde is very fresh, due to its natural acidity, with fruity and floral aromas that depend on the grape variety. The white wines are lemon- or straw-coloured, around 8.5 to 11% alcohol, and are made from local grape varieties Loureiro, Arinto, Trajadura, Avesso, and Azal. At less than one bar of CO2 pressure, they do not quite qualify as semi-sparkling wines but are nonetheless slightly sparkling. 

The red and rose Vinho Verde wines are much less common than the white ones. That is caused mainly by the region&#x27;s climatic conditions with its relatively cool temperatures and high level of rainfall that make it impossible for the red wine grapes to ripen. The Vinho Verde red wines usually have red color and a fruity flavor with the tasting notes of pepper, peony, and sour plum. Vinho Verde rose wines are also not very common, they have a slightly pink or intense color and red berries flavor.

Vinho Alvarinho is made from Alvarinho grapes, from a designated subregion of Monção and Melgaço. It has more alcohol (11.5 to 14%) and ripe tropical aromas. The reds are deep red and tannic, and are mostly made from Vinhão, Borraçal and Amaral grapes. The rosés are very fresh and fruity, usually made from Espadeiro and Padeiro grapes.

==History==

The Romans Seneca the Younger and Pliny the Elder both made reference to vines in the area between the rivers Douro and Minho.

A record exists of a winery being donated to the Alpendurada convent in Marco de Canaveses in 870 AD, and the vineyards seem to have expanded over the following centuries, planted by religious orders and encouraged by tax breaks. Wines were mostly produced for domestic consumption, although Vinho Verde may have been exported in the 12th century, to England, Germany, and Flanders. The first definite exports to England are recorded by John Croft as taking place in 1788.

The arrival of maize in the 16th century left a distinctive stamp on viticulture in the region. To maximize production of maize, new regulations banished vines to the field margins, where they would be draped over trees and hedges, forcing the vignerons to pick them from tall ladders.

The &quot;Vinho Verde Region&quot; was demarcated by the law of September 18, 1908 and a decree of October 1 of the same year. The regulations controlling production were largely set in 1926, with recognition as a &quot;Denominação de Origem Controlada&quot; (DOC) in 1984. The DOC is overseen by the Comissão de Viticultura da Região dos Vinhos Verdes ().

Currently, nearly 21,000 hectares of vineyards are planted, making up 9% of the total in Portugal. There are around 19,000 producers, down from 72,590 in 1981. Around 600 bottlers in the region produce 85 million liters of wine each year. 86% of the wine from Vinho Verde is white.

==Subregions==

The Vinho Verde DOC is divided into nine subregions, which may be indicated on the wine label together with the name of Vinho Verde, for example as Vinho Verde-Amarante. The subregions are: Amarante, Ave, Baião, Basto, Cávado, Lima, Monção e Melgaço, Paiva, and Sousa.

==Grapes==

The grape varieties recommended or permitted for the DOC are as follows:
*Recommended white grapes: Alvarinho, Arinto, Avesso, Azal, Batoca, Loureiro, and Trajadura
*Permitted white grapes: Branco-Escola, Cainho de Moreira, Cascal, Douradinha, Esganinho, Esganoso de Castelo de Paiva, Esganoso de Lima, Fernão Pires, Lameiro, Rabigato, S. Mamede, and Semilão
*Recommended red grapes: Amaral / Azal Tinto, Borraçal, Brancelho, Espadeiro, Padeiro, Pedral, Rabo de Ovelha, and Vinhão
*Permitted red grapes: Doçal, Doçal de Refóios, Espadeiro Mole, Labrusco, Mourisco, Pical Pôlho, Sousão, and Verdelho Tinto.

The two most successful white wine varieties are Alvarinho and Loureiro. Alvarinho tends to produce low yields and can reach much higher alcohol levels. The grape is widely planted in the northern Minho between the Lima Valley and Spanish border. Loureiro produces higher yields but very aromatic wines. The most successful red wine grape has been Vinhão, followed by Amaral / Azal Tinto and Espadeiro. These grapes can produce wines with deep purple coloring and peppery notes.

<text>In Power Kills: Democracy as a Method of Nonviolence by American political scientist Rudolph Rummel (1997), a sequel to his 1994 book &quot;Death by Government&quot; argues that the more power a government has, the more it tends to kill its own citizens and make war on other countries, and conversely, the less power a government has over its citizens, the less it tends to kill them or to launch wars of aggression, proposing that democracy is the form of government least likely to commit democide.

<doc id="464960" wikidata="Q7869824" url="?curid=464960" title="USS Grayback (SS-208)">
<text>USS &quot;Grayback&quot; (SS-208), a &quot;Tambor&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the lake herring, &quot;Coregonus artedi&quot;. She ranked 20th among all U.S. submarines in total tonnage sunk during World War II, with 63,835 tons, and 24th in number of ships sunk, with 14. She was sunk near Okinawa on 27 February 1944. Her wreck was discovered in June 2019.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Grayback&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 31 January 1940, sponsored by Mrs. Lydia Ballou Brown (&quot;née&quot; Chappell), wife of Rear Admiral Wilson Brown, Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy, and commissioned on 30 June 1941 with Lieutenant Willard A. Saunders in command.

==Operational history==
Attached to the United States Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Grayback&quot; conducted her shakedown cruise in Long Island Sound from Newport, New London, and New York City. In company with the submarine , she departed New London, Connecticut, on 8 September 1941 for patrol duty in the Caribbean Sea and Chesapeake Bay, then arrived at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, on 30 November 1941 for overhaul. After the United States&#x27;s entry into World War II, &quot;Grayback&quot; departed for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii arriving 8 February 1942.

=== First war patrol ===
&quot;Grayback&quot;″s first war patrol from 15 February to 10 April 1942 took her along the coast of Saipan and Guam. There, she had a four-day encounter with an enemy submarine; the enemy submarine fired two torpedoes at &quot;Grayback&quot; on the morning of 22 February, then continued to trail her across the Pacific. &quot;Grayback&quot; spotted the enemy conning tower a few times, and the Japanese ship broached once; but the &quot;Grayback&quot; could not get into position to attack. After four days, &quot;Grayback&quot; shook off the other submarine and continued on patrol. On 17 March, she sank her first ship, the 3291-ton cargo ship &quot;Ishikari Maru &quot;off Port Lloyd, Chichijima, Bonin Islands.
=== Second through fourth war patrols ===
&quot;Grayback&quot;″s second war patrol met with a dearth of targets, although she even took the unusual and risky measure of patrolling surfaced during the day. On 22 June, she arrived at Fremantle, Western Australia, which was to remain her home base for most of the war. On her third and fourth war patrols, in the South China Sea and St. George&#x27;s Passage, &quot;Grayback&quot; was hampered by bright moonlight, shallow and treacherous water, and enemy patrol craft. Despite these hazards, she damaged several freighters and an enemy submarine. The presence of &quot;Grayback&quot; and her sister ships in these waters, and the threat they presented to shipping and the number of enemy escorts they tied up, were important factors in the successful conclusion of the Guadalcanal campaign, America&#x27;s first offensive campaign in the Pacific war.

=== Fifth war patrol ===
Her fifth war patrol began as &quot;Grayback&quot; sailed from Australia on 7 December 1942. Only a week out of port, Pharmacist&#x27;s Mate Harry B. Roby was called upon to perform an emergency appendectomy, the second to be done on a patrolling submarine. With &quot;Grayback&quot; running 100 feet beneath the surface, the untutored Roby successfully removed the infected appendix, and his patient was back standing watch by the end of the patrol. Then, on 25 December, &quot;Grayback&quot; surfaced to sink four landing barges with her deck guns. Four days later, she was again fired on by an enemy submarine, but maneuvered to avoid the torpedoes. On 3 January 1943, &quot;Grayback&quot; sank &quot;I-18&quot;, one of 25 Japanese submarines destroyed by western submarines during the war.

On 5 January, &quot;Grayback&quot; served as beacon ship for the bombardment of Munda Bay in the Solomon Islands, and also engaged in rescue work. Lying off Munda early on the morning of 5 January, she received word that six survivors of a crashed Martin B-26 Marauder bomber from the 70th Bombardment Squadron were holed up on the island. &quot;Grayback&quot; sent ashore two men (Lt. J.A. Davis and CGM Barton Brooks), then submerged at dawn to avoid enemy aircraft. The submariners located the downed aviators, three of whom were injured, and hid out with them in the jungle. As night fell, &quot;Grayback&quot; surfaced offshore and by coded light signals directed the small boat &quot;home safe&quot; with the rescued aviators. For this action, skipper Edward C. Stephan received the Navy Cross, as well as a Silver Star from the United States Army.

&quot;Grayback&quot; continued on patrol, torpedoing and damaging several Japanese ships. On 17 January, she attacked a destroyer escorting a large &quot;maru&quot;, hoping to disable the escort and then sink the freighter with her deck guns. However, the destroyer evaded the torpedoes and dropped 19 depth charges on &quot;Grayback&quot;. One blew a gasket on a manhole cover, and the submarine, leaking seriously, was ordered back to Brisbane, Australia, where she arrived 23 January.

=== Sixth war patrol ===
On her sixth war patrol from 16 February to 4 April 1943, &quot;Grayback&quot; again had a run of bad luck, operating in the Bismarck Archipelago–Solomon Islands area without any military success. Her newly installed SJ radar had failed to function, and although she had taken several shots at &quot;maru&quot; merchant ships, none sank.

=== Seventh war patrol ===
The seventh patrol was more successful. Departing Brisbane on 25 April, &quot;Grayback&quot; intercepted a convoy whose position had been radioed to her by on 11 May. In a night surface attack, &quot;Grayback&quot; fired a spread of six torpedoes at the seven freighters and their three escorts. The three escorts charged, and she had to go deep to elude the attacking enemy. She was credited with the sinking of cargo ship &quot;Yodogawa Maru&quot;. On 16 May, she torpedoed and seriously damaged a destroyer. The following day, &quot;Grayback&quot; intercepted four &quot;marus&quot; with one escort; she sank the freighter &quot;England Maru&quot; and damaged two others before she was forced to dive. &quot;Grayback&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 30 May, then proceeded to San Francisco, California, for a much needed overhaul and modernization.

=== Eighth war patrol ===
Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 12 September 1943, &quot;Grayback&quot; prepared for her eighth war patrol, now under the command of John Anderson Moore. Sailing 26 September with , she met at Midway Island to form the first of the Submarine Force&#x27;s highly successful wolfpacks. The three submarines under Captain Charles B. &quot;Swede&quot; Momsen in &quot;Cero&quot; cruised the China Sea and returned to base with claims of 38,000 tons sunk and 3,300 damaged. &quot;Grayback&quot; accounted for two ships, a passenger-cargo vessel torpedoed 14 October and a former light cruiser, &quot;Awata Maru&quot;, torpedoed after an end-around run on a fast convoy 22 October. Wolfpack tactics came into play on 2 October as &quot;Grayback&quot; closed on a convoy already attacked by &quot;Shad&quot;, and sank a 9,000-ton transport, listing from two of &quot;Shad&quot;″s torpedoes. The submarines had now expended all torpedoes, and on 10 November, they returned to Midway.

&quot;Grayback&quot; commanding officer (CO) John Anderson Moore was awarded the Navy Cross after this patrol.

=== Ninth war patrol ===
With almost a quarter of her crew untested in battle &quot;Grayback&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for the East China Sea on 2 December for her ninth war patrol. Within five days of her first contact with Japanese ships, she had expended all her torpedoes in a series of attacks that netted four ships for over 10,000 tons. The action began on the night of 18 to 19 December; &quot;Grayback&quot; attacked a convoy of four freighters and three escorts. She sent freighter &quot;Gyokurei Maru&quot; and escort &quot;Numakaze&quot; to the bottom and damaged several others in a surface attack. Two nights later, 20 to 21 December, she spotted another convoy of six ships, and after an end-around run, she fired a spread of nine torpedoes into the heart of the Japanese formation. This first attack sank one freighter and damaged another before &quot;Grayback&quot; dived to elude depth charges. Three hours later, she surfaced and sank a second freighter. After an unsuccessful attack the following night had exhausted her torpedo supply, &quot;Grayback&quot; headed home. The submarine surfaced on 27 December to sink a good-sized fishing boat with deck guns before reaching Pearl Harbor on 4 January 1944.

CO John Anderson Moore was awarded a second Navy Cross after this mission.

=== Tenth war patrol and sinking ===

&quot;Grayback&quot;″s tenth patrol, her most successful in terms of tonnage sunk, was also her last. She sailed from Pearl Harbor on 28 January 1944 for the East China Sea. On 24 February, &quot;Grayback&quot; radioed that she had sunk two cargo ships on 19 February and had damaged two others (&quot;Taikei Maru&quot; and &quot;Toshin Maru&quot; sunk). On 25 February, she transmitted her second and final report. That morning, she had sunk tanker &quot;Nanho Maru&quot; and severely damaged &quot;Asama Maru&quot;. With only two torpedoes remaining, she was ordered home from patrol. Due to reach Midway on 7 March, &quot;Grayback&quot; did not arrive. On 30 March, ComSubPac listed her as missing and presumed lost with all hands.

From captured Japanese records, the submarine&#x27;s last few days were pieced together after World War II. Heading home through the East China Sea after attacking convoy Hi-40 on 24 February, &quot;Grayback&quot; used her last two torpedoes to sink the freighter &quot;Ceylon Maru&quot; on 27 February. Later that same day, a Japanese aircraft carrier-based Nakajima B5N (Allied reporting name &quot;Kate&quot;) torpedo bombers, probably launched from the aircraft carrier Zuikaku spotted &quot;Grayback&quot; on the surface in the East China Sea and attacked, hitting her with a aerial bomb. According to Japanese reports, the submarine &quot;exploded and sank immediately,&quot; but antisubmarine craft were called in to depth-charge the area, clearly marked by a trail of air bubbles, until at last a heavy oil slick swelled to the surface.

&quot;Grayback&quot;′s commanding officer John Anderson Moore was awarded his third Navy Cross posthumously after this patrol.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Grayback&quot; and her crew received two Navy Unit Commendations for their seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth war patrols.

&quot;Grayback&quot; received eight battle stars for her World War II service.

== Wreck discovery ==
On 10 November 2019, a private research group, &quot;Lost 52 Project&quot;, announced it had found the wreck of &quot;Grayback&quot; south of Okinawa, in June 2019. The wreck was discovered about from the coordinates established by the U.S. Navy in 1946 because of an error in its translation of the original Imperial Japanese Navy combat action reports. The discovery was officially verified by the U.S. Navy and the families of the deceased crew members were notified. The submarine sits upright on the bottom in 1,400 ft (430 m) of water. The deck gun was found about 400 ft (about 120 m) from the primary wreckage.

The wreck has severe damage aft of the conning tower, consistent with Japanese reports of a direct bomb hit in that area. The bow is broken off at an angle, and a portion of the hull near the stern imploded. The builder&#x27;s plate remains attached to the intact bridge.

<text>A couch, also known as a sofa, settee, chesterfield, or [[Davenport (sofa)|davenport]], is a cushioned item of furniture that can seat multiple people. It is commonly found in the form of a bench with upholstered armrests and is often fitted with springs and tailored cushion and pillows. Although a couch is used primarily for seating, it may be used for sleeping. In homes, couches are normally put in the family room, living room, den, or lounge. They are sometimes also found in non-residential settings such as hotels, lobbies of commercial offices, waiting rooms, and bars. Couches can also vary in size, color, and design.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;couch&quot; originally denoted an item of furniture for lying or sleeping on. &quot;Couch&quot; is predominantly used in North America, Australia, South Africa, and Ireland, whereas the terms &quot;sofa&quot; and &quot;settee&quot; (U and non-U) are most commonly used in the United Kingdom and India. The word &quot;couch&quot; originated in Middle English from the Old French noun &quot;&quot;, which derived from the verb meaning &quot;to lie down&quot;.

The word &quot;sofa&quot; comes from the Turkish language and is derived from the Arabic word &#x27; (&quot;ledge/bench&quot;), cognates with the Aramaic word &#x27; (&quot;mat&quot;). Nathan Bailey in his &quot;Dictionarium Britannicum&quot; (1730) defines sofa as a &quot;a sort of alcove much used in Asia ... furnished with rich carpets and cushions.&quot;

The word &quot;settee&quot; or &quot;setee&quot; comes from the Old English word &quot;&quot;, which was used to describe long benches with high backs and arms, but is now generally used to describe small upholstered seating structures. Both &quot;sofa&quot; and &quot;settee&quot; terms came into use in the beginning of the 18th century. Originally the settee defined a smaller sofa, but by the 20th century the distinction was lost.

Other terms which can be synonymous with the above definition are divan&quot;, &quot;davenport&quot;, &quot;lounge&quot;, and &quot;canapé&quot;.
In Canadian English, the word &quot;chesterfield&quot; is used to describe any couch or sofa, particularly among older Canadians. According to a 1992 survey conducted in the Golden Horseshoe region of Ontario, the term is quickly vanishing.

== Types ==
The most common types of couches include the two-seater, sometimes referred to as a loveseat, and the sofa. The loveseat is designed for seating two people, while the sofa has more than two cushion seats. A sectional sofa, often just referred to as a &quot;sectional&quot;, is formed from multiple sections (typically two, three, or four) and usually includes at least two pieces which join at an angle of 90 degrees or slightly greater. Sectional sofas are used to wrap around walls or other furniture.

Other variants include the divan, the fainting couch (backless or partial-backed) and the canapé (an ornamental three-seater). To conserve space, some sofas double as beds in the form of sofa beds, daybeds, or futons.

A furniture set consisting of a sofa with two matching chairs is known as a &quot;chesterfield suite&quot; or &quot;living-room suite&quot;. In the UK, the word &quot;chesterfield&quot; was used to refer to any couch in the 1900s. A chesterfield now describes a deep buttoned sofa, usually made from leather, with arms and back of the same height. The first chesterfield, with its distinctive deep buttoned, quilted (or &quot;tufted&quot;) leather upholstery and lower seat base, was commissioned by Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield (1694–1773).

== Materials ==
A couch consists of a frame, springs, padding, and a covering. The frame is usually made of wood, but can also be made of steel, plastic or laminated boards. Sofa padding is made from foam, down, feathers, fabric or a combination thereof. Sofa coverings are usually made out of soft leather, corduroy or linen. Couches commonly have springs under the padding for more support, although some don&#x27;t.

<text>One half is the multiplicative inverse of 2. It is an irreducible fraction with a numerator of 1 and a denominator of 2. It often appears in mathematical equations, recipes and measurements.

== As a word ==
One half is one of the few fractions which are commonly expressed in natural languages by suppletion rather than regular derivation. In English, for example, compare the compound &quot;one half&quot; with other regular formations like &quot;one-sixth&quot;. 

A &quot;half&quot; can also be said to be one part of something divided into two equal parts. It is acceptable to write one half as a hyphenated word, &quot;one-half&quot;.

== Mathematics ==
One half is the rational number that lies midway between 0 and 1 on the number line. Multiplication by one half is equivalent to division by two, or &quot;halving&quot;; conversely, division by one half is equivalent to multiplication by two, or &quot;doubling&quot;.

A number raised to the power of one half is equal to its square root. 

The area of a triangle is one half its base and altitude (or height).

The gamma function evaluated at one half is the square root of pi. 

It has two different decimal representations in base ten, the familiar formula_1 and the recurring formula_2, with a similar pair of expansions in any even base; while in odd bases, one half has no terminating representation.

The Bernoulli number formula_3 has the value formula_4 (its sign depending on competing conventions).

The Riemann hypothesis is the conjecture that every nontrivial complex root of the Riemann zeta function has a real part equal to formula_5.

== Computer characters ==
The &quot;one-half&quot; symbol has its own code point as a precomposed character in the
Latin-1 Supplement 
block of Unicode, rendering as .
The reduced size of this symbol may make it illegible to readers with relatively mild visual impairment; consequently the decomposed forms or may be more appropriate.

<doc id="464970" wikidata="Q458396" url="?curid=464970" title="Khorramshahr">
<text>Khorramshahr (; ) is a city in the Central District of Khorramshahr County, Khuzestan province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district. It is also known in Arabic by the local ethnically Arab population as Al-Muhammarah ().

Khorramshahr is an inland port city located approximately north of Abadan. The city extends to the right bank of the Shatt Al Arab waterway near its confluence with the Haffar arm of the Karun river. The city was destroyed in the Iran–Iraq War, with the 1986 census recording a population of zero. However, Khorramshahr was rebuilt after the war, and more recent censuses show that the population has returned to the pre-war level.

==History==
The area where the city exists today was originally under the waters of the Persian Gulf. It later became part of the vast marshlands and the tidal flats at the mouth of the Karun River. The small town known as &quot;Piyan&quot;, and later &quot;Bayan&quot; appeared in the area no sooner than the late Parthian time in the first century AD. Whether or not this was located at the same spot where Khurramshahr is today, is highly debatable.

During the Islamic centuries, the Daylamite Buwayhid king, Panah Khusraw Adud ad-Dawlah ordered the digging of a canal to join the Karun River (which at the time emptied independently into the Persian Gulf through the Bahmanshir channel) to the Shatt al-Arab (the joint estuary of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, known in Iran as &quot;Arvand Rud&quot;). The extra water made the joint estuary more reliably navigable. The channel thus created was known as the Haffar, Arabic for &quot;excavated,&quot; &quot;dugout,&quot; which exactly described what the channel was. The Haffar soon became the main channel of the Karun, as it is in the present day.

It was the capital of the Sheikdom of Muhammara, and until 1847, at which time it became Persian territory (according to Article II of the Treaty of Erzurum), Khorramshahr was alternately claimed and occupied by Persia and Turkey. Its ruler at the time was an Arab sheikh.

===Iran–Iraq War===

Because of the war, the population of Khorramshahr dropped from 146,706 in the 1976 census to 0 in the 1986 census. The population reached 34,750 in the 1991 census and by the 2006 census it reached 123,866, and according to World Gazetteer its population as of 2012 is 138,398, making the population close to what it was before the war.

==Demographics==
===Mandaean community===

Khorramshahr is home to a Mandaean community. It is one of the last remaining locations in the world where Neo-Mandaic is still spoken. There are only a few hundred speakers of the Khorramshahr dialect of Neo-Mandaic.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 123,866 in 26,385 households. The following census in 2011 counted 129,418 people in 33,623 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 133,097 people in 37,124 households.

<text>Jürgen Moltmann (8 April 1926 – 3 June 2024) was a German Reformed theologian who was a professor of systematic theology at the University of Tübingen and was known for his books such as the &quot;Theology of Hope&quot;, &quot;The Crucified God&quot;, &quot;God in Creation&quot; and other contributions to systematic theology. His works were translated into many languages.

Moltmann described his theology as an extension of Karl Barth&#x27;s theological works, especially the &quot;Church Dogmatics&quot;, and he described his work as &quot;Post-Barthian&quot;. He developed a form of liberation theology predicated on the view that God suffers with humanity, while also promising humanity a better future through the hope of the Resurrection, which he labelled a &#x27;theology of hope&#x27;. Much of Moltmann&#x27;s work was to develop the implications of these ideas for various areas of theology. Moltmann became known for developing a form of social trinitarianism. He was awarded several international honorary doctorates.

==Life and career==
===Youth===
Moltmann was born in Hamburg on 8 April 1926. His father was a teacher; the family was not religious. His grandfather was a grand master of the Freemasons. As a teenager, Moltmann idolized Albert Einstein, and anticipated studying mathematics at university.

===World War II===
Moltmann took his entrance exam to proceed with his education but instead was drafted into military service in 1943 at the age of 16, during World War II, serving as an Air Force auxiliary in the German Army. &quot;The reading matter which he took with him into the miseries of war were Goethe&#x27;s poems and the works of Nietzsche.&quot; He worked in an anti-aircraft battery during the bombing of his hometown of Hamburg by the Royal Air Force, an attack that killed 40,000 people, including a friend standing next to him. Ordered to the Klever Reichswald, a German forest at the front lines, he surrendered in 1945 in the dark to the first British soldier he met. From 1945 to 1948, he was confined as a prisoner of war (POW) and moved from camp to camp. 

He was first confined as a POW in Belgium, then Scotland, then England. In the camp at Belgium, the prisoners were given little to do. Moltmann and his fellow prisoners were tormented by &quot;memories and gnawing thoughts&quot;. They had escaped death but had lost all hope and confidence. After Belgium, Moltmann was transferred to a camp in Kilmarnock, Scotland, where he worked with other Germans to rebuild areas damaged by bombing. The hospitality of the Scottish residents toward the prisoners left a great impression upon him. In Scotland, they also saw photographs, nailed up confrontationally in their huts, of Buchenwald and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps. The initial reaction of the prisoners was that these photos were propaganda, but gradually they began to see themselves through the eyes of the Nazis&#x27; victims. Moltmann was given a small copy of the New Testament and Psalms by an American chaplain and reading these gave him a new hope.

In July 1946, he was transferred for the last time to Norton Camp, a British prison located in the village of Cuckney near Nottingham, UK. The camp was operated by the YMCA and here Moltmann met many students of theology. At Norton Camp, he discovered Reinhold Niebuhr&#x27;s &quot;The Nature and Destiny of Man&quot;. It was the first book of theology he had ever read, and Moltmann claimed it had a huge impact on his life. His experience as a POW gave him a great understanding of how suffering and hope reinforce each other, leaving a lasting impression on his theology. Moltmann later claimed, &quot;I never decided for Christ, as is often demanded of us, but I am sure that, then and there, in the dark pit of my soul, he found me.&quot;

===After the war===
Moltmann returned home at 22 years of age to find his hometown of Hamburg (in fact, much of his country) in ruins from Allied bombing in World War II. In 1947, he and four others were invited to attend the first postwar Student Christian Movement in Swanwick, a conference center near Derby, England. The conference affected him deeply. Moltmann returned to Germany to study at the University of Göttingen, an institution whose professors were followers of Karl Barth and theologians who were engaged with the Confessing Church in Germany. He received his doctorate, supervised by Otto Weber, in 1952. From 1952 to 1957, Moltmann was the pastor in Bremen-Wasserhorst, and also pastor for students. In 1958 Moltmann became a theology teacher at the that was operated by the Confessing Church and in 1963 he joined the theological faculty at the University of Bonn. He was appointed Professor of Systematic Theology at the University of Tübingen in 1967 and remained there until his retirement in 1994. From 1963 to 1983, Moltmann was a member of the Faith and Order Committee of the World Council of Churches. From 1983 to 1993, Moltmann was the Robert W. Woodruff Distinguished Visiting Professor of Systematic Theology at Candler School of Theology at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. He delivered the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh in 1984–1985.

== Personal life ==
Moltmann was married to Elisabeth Moltmann-Wendel, who studied with him and became a notable feminist theologian. They married in 1952 and had four daughters. His wife died in 2016.

Moltmann died in Tübingen on 3 June 2024, at the age of 98.

==Theological views==
The early Moltmann can be seen in his trilogy, &quot;Theology of Hope&quot; (1964), &quot;The Crucified God&quot; (1972), and &quot;The Church in the Power of the Spirit&quot; (1975):
*&quot;Theology of Hope&quot; was strongly influenced by the eschatological orientation of the Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch&#x27;s &quot;The Principle of Hope&quot;.
*&quot;The Crucified God&quot; posited that God died on the Cross, raising the question of the impassibility of God.
*&quot;The Church in the Power of the Spirit&quot; explores the implications of these explorations for the church in its own life and in the world.

The later Moltmann took a less systematic approach to theology, leading to what he called his &quot;systematic contributions to theology&quot; that sought to provoke and engage more than develop some kind of set Moltmannian theology.

Moltmann corroborated his ideas with those of Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and Jews in an attempt to reach a greater understanding of Christian theology, which he believed should be developed ecumenically.

Moltmann had a passion for the Kingdom of God as it exists both in the future, and in the God of the present. His theology is often referred to as &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; Theology. His theology is built on eschatology, and the hope found in the resurrected Christ. This theology is most clearly explained in his book &quot;Theology of Hope&quot;.

Moltmann&#x27;s theology is also seen as a theology of liberation, though not in the sense that the term is most understood. Moltmann not only viewed salvation as Christ&#x27;s &quot;preferential option for the poor,&quot; but also as offering the hope of reconciliation to the oppressors of the poor. If it were not as such, divine reconciliation would be insufficient.

=== Eschatology: theology of hope ===
Moltmann&#x27;s theology of hope is a theological perspective with an eschatological foundation and focuses on the hope that the resurrection brings. Through faith we are bound to Christ, and as such have the hope of the resurrected Christ (&quot;Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead&quot; (1 Peter 1:3, NIV)), and knowledge of his return. For Moltmann, the hope of the Christian faith was hope in the resurrection of Christ crucified. Hope and faith depend on each other to remain true and substantial; and only with both may one find &quot;not only a consolation in suffering, but also the protest of the divine promise against suffering&quot;.

However, because of this hope we hold, we may never exist harmoniously in a society such as ours which is based on sin. When following the theology of hope, a Christian should find hope in the future but also experience much discontentment with the way the world is now, corrupt and full of sin. Sin bases itself in hopelessness, which can take on two forms: presumption and despair. &quot;Presumption is a premature, selfwilled anticipation of the fulfillment of what we hope for from God. Despair is the premature, arbitrary anticipation of the non-fulfillment of what we hope for from God.&quot;

In Moltmann&#x27;s opinion, all should be seen from an eschatological perspective, looking toward the days when Christ will make all things new. &quot;A proper theology would therefore have to be constructed in the light of its future goal. Eschatology should not be its end, but its beginning.&quot; This does not, as many fear, &#x27;remove happiness from the present&#x27; by focusing all ones attention toward the hope for Christ&#x27;s return. Moltmann addressed this concern as such: &quot;Does this hope cheat man of the happiness of the present? How could it do so! For it is itself the happiness of the present.&quot; The importance of the current times is necessary for the theology of hope because it brings the future events to the here and now. This theological perspective of eschatology makes the hope of the future, the hope of today. Hope strengthens faith and aids a believer into living a life of love, and directing them toward a new creation of all things. It creates in a believer a &quot;passion for the possible&quot; &quot;For our knowledge and comprehension of reality, and our reflections on it, that means at least this: that in the medium of hope our theological concepts become not judgments which nail reality down to what it is, but anticipations which show reality its prospects and its future possibilities.&quot; This passion is one that is centered around the hope of the resurrected and the returning Christ, creating a change within a believer and drives the change that a believer seeks make on the world.

For Moltmann, creation and eschatology depend on one another. There exists an ongoing process of creation, continuing creation, alongside &quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot; and the consummation of creation. The consummation of creation will consist of the eschatological transformation of this creation into the new creation. For Moltmann, the eschatological is not merely one element of Christianity, it is the key element. Founded on the resurrection, Christian theology is &quot;at its hard core [a] theology of the cross... Conversely, the theology of the cross is the &#x27;reverse side&#x27; of the theology of hope.&quot; Christ in this world takes the form of the cross of Christ and the sufferings of Christians, and that cross is an eschatologically open event in which the love of God for the godless is revealed. While Moltmann saw Christian hope, contained in the promise of an eschatological future, as built upon contradiction: (the crucified and risen Jesus, the cross and the resurrection, god-forsakenness and the nearness of God), it is contradiction that contains Jesus&#x27; identity within it, not above or beyond it. &quot;The goal of history is an eschatological &#x27;panentheism&#x27; in which God will be in everything and everything will be in God.&quot; 

===Liberation theology===
Moltmann&#x27;s liberation theology includes an understanding of both the oppressed and the oppressor as needing reconciliation. &quot;Oppression has two sides: on one side there is the master, on the other side the slave... Oppression destroys humanity on both sides.&quot; The goal is one of mutual liberation. God&#x27;s &#x27;preferential option for the poor&#x27; should not be exclusive, but rather include the rich; insofar as God holds judgment over them also. The sufferings of the poor should not be seen as equal to or a representation of the sufferings of Jesus. Our suffering is not an offering to God, it is not required of us to suffer. The point of the crucified Christ was to present an alternative to human suffering. Human suffering is not a quality of salvation, and should not be viewed as such. This is not to say that the sufferings of humans is of no importance to God.

This &quot;mutual liberation&quot; necessarily involves a &quot;liberation of oppressors from the evil they commit; otherwise there can be no liberation for a new community in justice and freedom.&quot; However, the liberation of the oppressed takes priority and must involve their own agency in order for true justice and reconciliation to be enacted: &quot;In order to achieve this goal, the oppressed will have to free themselves from the constraints of oppression and cut themselves off from their oppressors, so as to find themselves and their own humanity. It is only after that that they can try to find a truly humane community with their previous oppressors.&quot; This seeks to avoid either the dependency of the oppressed or the co-optation of the struggles of the oppressed by the oppressor. It is with this sensibility that Moltmann explores, in his &quot;Experiences in Theology&quot;, what various liberation theologies might mean for the oppressor: Black theology for whites, Latin American liberation theology for the First World, feminist theology for men, etc. He also moves beyond oppression as a mere personal sin and instead calls for oppressors to withdraw from the &quot;structures of violence&quot; that destroy the lives of the oppressed.

===Trinitarian theology===
Moltmann stressed the perichoresis of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This is to say that he believes the three dwell in one another. The three persons are differentiated in their characteristics, but related in their original exchange. Moltmann sought to defeat a monotheistic Christianity that is being used as a tool for political and clerical absolute monarchism. He believed the doctrine of the Trinity should be developed as the &quot;true theological doctrine of freedom.&quot; He suggested that we &quot;cease to understand God monotheistically as the one, absolute subject, but instead see him in a trinitarian sense as the unity of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.&quot;

Moltmann related his views on the trinity to three modes of human freedom. The first mode is the political meaning of freedom as supremacy. This mode was rejected by Moltmann, who saw it as corresponding to a God who rules over his creation, which exists merely to serve Him. It is a relation of a subject with an object, where the goal is to enhance the supremacy of the subject. The second mode of human freedom is the socio-historical and Hegelian meaning of freedom as communion, which implies the relation between two subjects. This relationship aims at love and solidarity, and corresponds to the perichoresis of the Father and Son, and through the Son the children of God, or humanity. This relationship is both liberating and loving, and is one Moltmann favored. The third mode of human freedom is the implicitly religious concept of freedom as the passion of the creature for his or her potential. This deals with the relationship between subjects and their common future project. This is the mode favored most by Moltmann, who correlates this relationship with the one humans share with God in the realm of the Holy Spirit. Here, an indwelling of the Spirit allows humans to be friends with God. As you can see, the first mode of freedom is political, and focuses on The Father; the second is communal, focusing on the Son; and the third is religious, focusing on the Spirit.

==Influences==
Upon his return to Germany in 1948, Moltmann began his course of study at Göttingen University, where he was strongly influenced by Karl Barth&#x27;s dialectical theology. Moltmann grew critical of Barth&#x27;s neglect of the historical nature of reality, and began to study Bonhoeffer. He developed a greater concern for social ethics, and the relationship between church and society. Moltmann also developed an interest in Luther and Hegel, the former of whose doctrine of justification and theology of the cross interested him greatly. Otto Weber was doctoral adviser to Moltmann&#x27;s future wife, and at the beginning of the winter semester of 1949, Moltmann asked Weber for an idea for a doctoral thesis of his own. Weber suggested a seventeenth century Calvinist who advocated a universalism within predestination which later formed the foundation of much of Moltmann&#x27;s theology. Weber remained important to Moltmann throughout his life. 

Moltmann cites the English pacifist and anti-capitalist theologian Geoffrey Anketell Studdert Kennedy as being highly regarded. However the inspiration for his first major work, &quot;Theology of Hope&quot;, was the Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch&#x27;s &quot;The Principle of Hope&quot;. Bloch is concerned to establish hope as the guiding principle of his Marxism and stresses the implied humanism inherent in mystical tradition. Bloch claims to identify an atheism at the core of Christianity, embodied in the notion of the death of God and the continued imperative of seeking the Kingdom. The whole theme of the &quot;Theology of Hope&quot; was worked out in counterpoint to the theology of Wolfhart Pannenberg, who had worked alongside Moltmann at Wuppertal, and had also undergone a conversion experience during Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II. With its slogan of &quot;History as Revelation&quot;, Pannenberg&#x27;s theology has many parallels, but Moltmann was concerned to reject any notion of history as a closed system and to shift the stress from revelation to action; hope is openness to the future.

The background influence in all these thinkers is Hegel, who is referenced more times than any other writer in the &quot;Theology of Hope&quot;. Like the Left Hegelians who immediately succeeded the master, both Moltmann and Pannenberg are determined to retain the sense of history as meaningful and central to Christian discourse, while avoiding the essentially conformist and conservative aspects of his thought. In so doing, they are wrestling with the history of Germany itself. They are also implicitly offering a critique of the Neo-Orthodox theology of Karl Barth and Emil Brunner, which they see as ahistorical in its core. Moltmann writes that Barth&#x27;s eschatology was at first &quot;not unfriendly towards dynamic and cosmic perspectives&quot; but that he then came under the influence of Plato and Kant and so &quot;set to work in terms of the dialectic of time and eternity and came under the bane of the transcendental eschatology of Kant&quot;. The liberalism of Rudolf Bultmann is not sharply distinguished from the other dialectical theologies, since it is still focussed on an event of revelation – albeit as &quot;an event which transposes me into a new state of my self&quot;.

While &quot;Theology of Hope&quot; was strongly influenced by the eschatological orientation of the Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch&#x27;s &quot;The Principle of Hope&quot;, in Moltmann&#x27;s second major work &quot;The Crucified God&quot;, the philosophical inspiration comes from a different vein of philosophy. In &quot;Explanation of the Theme&quot;, his introduction to the book, Moltmann acknowledges that the direction of his questioning has shifted to that of existentialist philosophy and the Marxism of the Frankfurt School. Moltmann cites Joachim Iwand, Ernst Wolf and Otto Weber as major influences on his theology as it was developing at Göttingen.

The title of Moltmann&#x27;s crucial work is derived from Martin Luther, and its use marked a renewed engagement with a specifically Lutheran strain in Protestant theology, as opposed to the more Calvinist tenor of his earlier work. Moltmann&#x27;s widening interest in theological perspectives from a broad cultural arena is evident in his use of the 1946 book by Kazoh Kitamori, &quot;Theology of the Pain of God&quot;, which he relates to Bonhoeffer&#x27;s prison reflections. However, he footnotes Kitamori&#x27;s very conservative, individualist conclusions, which he does not share. Moltmann continued to see Christ as dying in solidarity with movements of liberation, God choosing to die with the oppressed. This work and its footnotes are full of references, direct and implied, to the New Left and the uprisings of 1968, the Prague Spring the French May and, closest to home, the German APO, and their aftermath. Moltmann cited Johann and Christoph Blumhardt as a major contributors to his thought.

== Honours ==
Moltmann received honorary doctorates from a number of institutions, such as Duke University (1973), the University of Louvain in Belgium (1995), the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University in Romania (1996), the Chung Yuan Christian University in Taiwan (2002), the Nicaraguan Evangelical University (2002), and the University of Pretoria in South Africa (2017).

Moltmann received the 2000 University of Louisville and Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary Grawemeyer Award in Religion for his book &quot;The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology&quot;.

<doc id="464988" wikidata="Q46262" url="?curid=464988" title="Spherulite">
<text>In petrology, spherulites () are small, rounded bodies that commonly occur in vitreous igneous rocks. They are often visible in specimens of obsidian, pitchstone, and rhyolite as globules about the size of millet seed or rice grain, with a duller luster than the surrounding glassy base of the rock, and when they are examined with a lens they prove to have a radiate fibrous structure.

==Structure==
Under the microscope the spherulites are of circular outline and are composed of thin divergent fibers that are crystalline as verified with polarized light. Between crossed Nicols, a black cross appears in the spherulite; its axes are usually perpendicular to one another and parallel to the crosshairs; as the microscope stage is rotated the cross remains steady; between the black arms there are four bright sectors. This shows that the spherulite consists of radiate, doubly refracting fibers that have a straight extinction; the arms of the black cross correspond to those fibers that are extinguished. The aggregate is too fine-grained to directly determine what minerals it is composed of using visible light microscopy.

==Occurrence==
Spherulites are most common in silica-rich glassy rocks. Sometimes they compose the whole mass; more usually they are surrounded by a glassy or felsitic base. When obsidians are devitrified, the spherulites are often traceable, though they may be more or less completely recrystallized or silicified. In the center of a spherulite there may be a crystal (e.g. quartz or feldspar) or sometimes a cavity. Occasionally spherulites have zones of different colors, and while most frequently spherical, they may also be polygonal or irregular in outline. In some New Zealand rhyolites the spherulites send branching cervicorn processes (like stags horns) outwards through the surrounding glass of the rock. The name axiolites is given to long, elliptical or band-like spherulites.

==Megaspherulites==
Occasionally spherulites are found that are many centimeters and, even more rarely, up to two or three meters in diameter. Those spherulites, which are more than 20 centimeters in diameter, are called megaspherulites. Near Silver Cliff, Colorado, megaspherulites, which range in diameter from 0.30 to 4.3 meters occur within a thick layer of rhyolitic vitrophyre. Megaspherulites as large as 0.91 meter occur within rhyolite exposures on Steens Mountain, Oregon and ones as large as 1.83 meters in diameter occur within welded tuffs exposed near Klondyke, Arizona. The best known occurrence of megaspherulites are stone balls, which range in diameter from 0.61 to 3.35 meters, found around Cerro Piedras Bola in the Sierra de Ameca between Ahualulco de Mercado and Ameca, Jalisco. As often happens with considerably smaller spherulites, these megaspherulites have been released by weathering from an ash flow tuff, in which they originally formed, to create natural stone balls.

==Lithophysae==
Very large and cavernous spherulites are called lithophysae; they are found in obsidians at Lipari, in Yellowstone Park and other places. The characteristic radiate fibrous structure is usually conspicuous, but the fibers are interrupted by cavities that are often arranged as to give the spherulite a resemblance to a rosebud with folded petals separated by arching interspaces. Some of these lithophysae are several centimeters or more in diameter. Tridymite, fayalite and other minerals in the lithophysae may be precipitates from the vapor phase that occupied the cavities. The fibers of these coarse spherulites are alkali feldspar (sanidine or anorthoclase) and tridymite.

==Artificial glass==
Artificial glass sometimes crystallizes and contains spherulites that may be as large as a marble. As the glass has little similarity in chemical composition to volcanic obsidians, these spherulites when analyzed throw little light on the mineral nature of spherulites in rocks. They show, however, that in viscous semi-solid glasses near their fusion point crystallization tends to nucleate at certain centers and to spread outwards, producing spherulitic structures. Many salts and organic substances exhibit the same tendency, yielding beautiful spherulite crystallizations when melted and cooled rapidly on a microscopic slide.

==Variolites==
Variolites are a type of radiate fibrous growth, resembling spherulites in many respects, consisting of minute feathery crystals spreading outwards through a fine grained or glassy rock. In variolites there are straight or feathery feldspar crystals (usually oligoclase) forming pale-colored spherulites a quarter to half an inch in diameter. The same rocks often contain similar aggregates of plumose skeleton crystals of augite. Many volcanic rocks have small lath-shaped crystals of feldspar or augite diverging from a common center.

<text>USS &quot;Harder&quot; (SS-257), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the harder, a fish of the mullet family found off South Africa. One of the most famous submarines of World War II, she received the Presidential Unit Citation. Her commanding officer throughout her service, the resolute and resourceful Commander Samuel D. Dealey (1906–1944), &quot;a submariner&#x27;s submariner&quot;, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, as well as four Navy Crosses during his lifetime.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Harder&quot;″s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut, on 1 December 1941. She was launched on 19 August 1942, sponsored by Miss Helen M. Shafroth, daughter of Rear Admiral John F. Shafroth Jr., and commissioned on 2 December 1942.

==Operational history==
&quot;Harder&quot; performed shakedown off the United States East Coast, then headed for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, via the Panama Canal. While crossing the Caribbean Sea on the surface in a designated safety lane on 2 May 1943, she sighted an approaching U.S. Navy PBY Catalina flying boat at a range of . She flashed that day′s recognition signal at the PBY, which responded by opening machine-gun fire along &quot;Harder&quot;′s starboard side. As &quot;Harder&quot; crash-dived and made a hard turn to port, the PBY dropped two bombs, the first of which shook &quot;Harder&quot;. &quot;Harder&quot; was able to continue her voyage to Pearl Harbor.

===First war patrol===
After a short stay at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Harder&quot; departed on her first war patrol on 7 June 1943. Cruising off the coast of Japan, the submarine worked her way inside a picket line and sighted her first target on 22 June. She made a radar approach on the surface and fired four torpedoes at the two-ship convoy, hitting the seaplane transport (7,189 BRT) (which was beached to prevent sinking, but later destroyed). She returned to Midway on 7 July.

===Second war patrol===
&quot;Harder&quot; began her second war patrol 24 August 1943 from Pearl Harbor, and after touching at Midway Island, she again headed for the Japanese coast. While patrolling off Honshū on 9 September, she attacked and sank &quot;Koyo Maru&quot; and later that night ran by an escort ship at a range of without being detected. Two days later the submarine encountered a convoy. After running ahead to improve her firing position, she sank the cargo ship &quot;Yoko Maru&quot; with a spread of three torpedoes. Continuing her patrol, &quot;Harder&quot; sighted two more ships on 13 September but was forced down by enemy planes while firing torpedoes. Escorts then kept the submarine down with a severe depth charge attack that lasted over two days and almost exhausted her batteries. After evading the Japanese ships, &quot;Harder&quot; detected her next target on 19 September; a torpedo sent &quot;Kachisan Maru&quot; to the bottom almost immediately. Though running in bad weather, &quot;Harder&quot; continued to find targets. On 23 September she sank the 4,500-ton freighter &quot;Kowa Maru&quot; and the 5,800-ton tanker &quot;Daishin Maru&quot;, off Nagoya Bay. Her torpedoes expended, &quot;Harder&quot; turned eastward on 28 September. After shooting up two armed trawlers on 29 September, she touched Midway on 4 October and arrived at Pearl Harbor four days later.

===Third war patrol===
For her third war patrol &quot;Harder&quot; teamed with and to form a coordinated and hence more effective attack group known as a wolfpack. Departing on 30 October 1943 for the Mariana Islands, &quot;Harder&quot; encountered a target on 12 November. Promptly dispatching this one, she surfaced and sighted a trawler escort damaged by the explosion of one of her depth charges. Submerging again until sunset, the submarine then surfaced under the cover of darkness and sank the damaged ship with gunfire, then turned toward Saipan in search of new targets. Sighting three &quot;Marus&quot; (merchant ships) on 19 November, she radioed her companion vessels and closed for an attack. After passing close by an escorting destroyer, &quot;Harder&quot; fired six torpedoes at two of the cargo ships, sinking &quot;Udo Maru&quot;. As depth charges began to fall, she pressed the attack; two more torpedoes finished &quot;Hokko Maru&quot;. &quot;Harder&quot; climbed to periscope depth after nightfall to finish off the third &quot;maru&quot;, the 6,000-ton &quot;Nikkō Maru&quot;. Shortly before midnight, she fired several more torpedoes at it, but the Japanese ship stubbornly refused to sink. A doomed, enemy crew kept the cargo ship afloat until &quot;Harder&quot; had expended all torpedoes, many of which ran erratically. Rough weather the next day finally sank the damaged target. &quot;Harder&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 30 November, then sailed to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul.

===Fourth war patrol===

Returning to action in the Pacific, &quot;Harder&quot; reached Pearl Harbor on 27 February 1944 and departed on her fourth war patrol on 16 March in company with .

She headed for the western Caroline Islands where she was assigned duty as a lifeguard ship for downed aviators. During American air strikes against Woleai on 1 April, &quot;Harder&quot; received word of an injured pilot awaiting rescue from the beach of a small enemy-held island west of Woleai. Protected by air cover, she nosed against a reef, maintained her position with both propellers, and sent a boat ashore through breaking surf. Despite Japanese snipers, boiling shoals, and the precarious position of the submarine, the daring rescue succeeded, and the intrepid submarine returned to the open sea.

On 13 April, an enemy plane sighted &quot;Harder&quot; north of the western Carolines and reported her position to the patrolling Japanese destroyer . As the enemy ship closed to within &quot;Harder&quot; fired a spread of torpedoes that sank the attacker within five minutes. Dealey&#x27;s terse report became famous—&quot;Expended four torpedoes and one Jap destroyer.&quot; Four days later &quot;Harder&quot; spotted a merchant ship escorted by destroyers. Firing four torpedoes, she sank the 7,000-ton &quot;Matsue Maru&quot; and damaged one of the escorts. Then, adding to the enemy&#x27;s losses, she returned to Woleai where she surfaced on the morning of 20 April to deliver a shore bombardment under cover of a rain squall. She ended this highly varied and successful patrol at Fremantle submarine base, Western Australia on 3 May.

===Fifth war patrol: Philippine mission===
Even greater successes lay ahead. Having sunk one destroyer, &quot;Harder&quot; joined the all-out hunt against Japanese destroyers, once considered the most dangerous of foes. Assigned the area around the Japanese fleet anchorage at Tawi-Tawi, &quot;Harder&quot; departed Fremantle on 26 May 1944 with and headed for the Celebes Sea.

On 6 June &quot;Harder&quot; entered the heavily patrolled Sibutu Passage between Tawi-Tawi and North Borneo and encountered a convoy of three tankers and two destroyers. She gave chase on the surface but was illuminated by the moon. As one of the destroyers turned to attack, &quot;Harder&quot; submerged, turned her stern to the charging destroyer, and fired three torpedoes at a range of . Two struck and exploded; the destroyer sank within five minutes. After attacking the second escort without success, &quot;Harder&quot; was held down by a depth charge attack while the convoy escaped.

Early the next morning an enemy plane spotted &quot;Harder&quot;. The submarine soon sighted another destroyer searching the area for her. As before, &quot;Harder&quot; took the initiative as the enemy closed the range. The sub fired three torpedoes at short range, and two of them struck amidships, one detonating the ship&#x27;s magazine with a tremendous explosion. sank a minute later. Following the inevitable depth charge attack, &quot;Harder&quot; transited the Sibutu Passage after dark and steamed to the northeast coast of Borneo. There on the night of 8 June, she picked up six Australian coastwatchers, and early next day she headed once more for the Sibutu Passage.

That evening &quot;Harder&quot; sighted two enemy destroyers patrolling the narrowest part of the passage, just a few miles from Tawi-Tawi. After submerging, she made an undetected approach and at fired four torpedoes at the overlapping targets. The second and third torpedoes blasted ; she sank almost immediately, her boilers erupting with a terrific explosion. The fourth shot hit the second ship, which exploded with a blinding flash. Within minutes &quot;Harder&quot; surfaced to survey the results, but both ships had disappeared. Soon afterward, she underwent the inevitable depth charge attack by enemy planes, then she set course for a point south of Tawi-Tawi to reconnoiter.

On the afternoon of 10 June &quot;Harder&quot; sighted a large Japanese task force, including three battleships and four cruisers with screening destroyers. An overhead plane spotted the submarine at periscope depth and a screening escort promptly steamed at toward her position. Once again, &quot;Harder&quot; became the aggressive adversary. As the range closed to , she fired three torpedoes on a &quot;down the throat&quot; shot, then went deep to escape the onrushing destroyer and certain depth charge attack. Within a minute two torpedoes blasted the ship with violent force just as &quot;Harder&quot; passed her some below. The deafening explosions shook the submarine far worse than the depth charges and aerial bombs that the infuriated enemy dropped during the next two hours. When she surfaced, &quot;Harder&quot; saw only a lighted buoy marking the spot where the unidentified destroyer either sank or was heavily damaged.

&quot;Harder&quot; reconnoitered Tawi-Tawi anchorage on 11 June and sighted additional enemy cruisers and destroyers. At 16:00 she headed for the open sea and that night transmitted her observations which were of vital importance to Admiral Raymond A. Spruance&#x27;s fleet before the decisive Battle of the Philippine Sea. &quot;Harder&quot; sailed to Darwin on 21 June for additional torpedoes, and, after patrolling the Flores Sea south of the Celebes Islands (with Admiral Ralph Christie aboard), she ended the patrol at Darwin on 3 July.

The important results of &quot;Harder&quot;″s fifth war patrol have caused some to call it the most brilliant of the war. Not only did &quot;Harder&quot; further deplete the critical supply of destroyers by sinking four of them and heavily damaging or destroying another one in four days, but her frequent attacks and a rash of enemy contact reports on this fleeting marauder so frightened Admiral Soemu Toyoda that he believed Tawi-Tawi to be surrounded by submarines. As a result, Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa&#x27;s Mobile Fleet departed Tawi-Tawi a day ahead of schedule. The premature departure upset the Japanese battle plans and forced Ozawa to delay his carrier force in the Philippine Sea, thus contributing to the stunning defeat suffered by the Japanese in the ensuing battle.

&quot;Harder&quot;″s radioman, Calvin Bull, was awarded a Bronze Star medal for his role in sinking the five destroyers.

===Sixth war patrol===
&quot;Harder&quot;, accompanied by and , departed Fremantle on 5 August 1944 for her sixth and final war patrol. Assigned to the South China Sea off Luzon, the wolfpack headed northward. On 21 August &quot;Harder&quot; and &quot;Haddo&quot; joined , , and in a coordinated attack against a convoy off Palawan Bay, Mindoro. The Japanese lost four passenger cargo &quot;Maru&quot;s, possibly one by &quot;Harder&quot;.

====Battle of Dasol Bay====
Early the next day, &quot;Harder&quot; and &quot;Haddo&quot; attacked and destroyed three coastal defense vessels off Bataan, &quot;Harder&quot; sinking frigates and &quot;Hiburi&quot;; then, joined by &quot;Hake&quot; that night, they headed for Caiman Point, Luzon. At dawn 23 August &quot;Haddo&quot; attacked and fatally damaged off Cape Bolinao. Enemy trawlers towed the stricken destroyer to Dasol Bay, and &quot;Haddo&quot;, her torpedoes expended, informed &quot;Harder&quot; and &quot;Hake&quot; the following night of the attack and left the wolfpack for replenishment at Biak.
&quot;Harder&quot; and &quot;Hake&quot; remained off Dasol Bay, searching for new targets. Before dawn on 24 August two ships were spotted which they initially identified as a Japanese minesweeper and the three-stack Siamese destroyer . The two ships were later discovered to be the Japanese Type D escort ship &quot;CD-22,&quot; and the very unusual destroyer &quot;PB-102,&quot; flying the Japanese flag. &quot;PB-102&quot; was built in the United States and commissioned as , a , but she was damaged by Japanese fire during the Battle of Badung Strait. While under repair in drydock at Surabaya in February 1942, the Japanese captured the airfield at Bali, thus threatening the naval base and so the ship was scuttled at the docks early in World War II. The Japanese Navy discovered the wreck, and raised, repaired, and recommissioned the vessel into Japanese service in 1943 as &quot;Patrol Boat 102&quot;.

As &quot;Hake&quot; closed to attack, the destroyer turned away toward Dasol Bay. &quot;Hake&quot; broke off her approach, turned northward, and then sighted &quot;Harder&quot;″s periscope about dead ahead. Swinging southward to avoid a collision, &quot;Hake&quot; then sighted &quot;CD-22&quot; about off her port quarter swinging toward them. To escape the charging escort, &quot;Hake&quot; started deep and rigged for silent running. At 07:28 she heard 15 rapid depth charges explode in the distance astern, after which, communication with the USS Harder was lost. She continued evasive action that morning, then returned to the general area of the attack shortly after noon. She swept the area at periscope depth but found only a ring of marker buoys covering a radius of one-half mile.

The vigorous depth charge attack had sunk &quot;Harder&quot; with all hands. The Japanese report of the attack concluded that &quot;much oil, wood chips, and cork floated in the vicinity.&quot; The United States Navy declared her loss on 2 January 1945.

Dubbed &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Harder,&quot; she had wreaked havoc among Japanese shipping. Her record of aggressive daring exploits became almost legendary. All six of her patrols were designated successful. &quot;Harder&quot; received six battle stars and the Presidential Unit Citation for World War II service. Following Navy custom, the citation was presented to the second &quot;Harder&quot; upon commissioning.

Despite the loss of nine more submarines in late 1944, towards the end of the war U.S. fleet boats were actively penetrating through the Inland Sea, and the Japanese shipping losses continued, albeit at a slower rate.

==Discovery of wreck==
On 22 May 2024, Tiburon Subsea CEO Tim Taylor and the Lost 52 Project announced that they had discovered the wreck of &quot;Harder&quot; in the South China Sea near the Philippines&#x27; northern island of Luzon. Taylor&#x27;s discovery was confirmed by the U.S. Navy based on video footage taken of the wreckage. &quot;Harder&quot; sits mostly intact and upright at a depth of . A large hole on the port side just aft of the conning tower indicates &quot;Harder&quot; likely received a direct hit by a depth charge, similar to the fate suffered by .

<text>A student loan is a type of loan designed to help students pay for post-secondary education and the associated fees, such as tuition, books and supplies, and living expenses. It may differ from other types of loans in the fact that the interest rate may be substantially lower and the repayment schedule may be deferred while the student is still in school. It also differs in many countries in the strict laws regulating renegotiating and bankruptcy. This article highlights the differences of the student loan system in several major countries.

== Australia ==

Tertiary student places in Australia are usually funded through the HECS-HELP scheme. This funding is in the form of loans that are not normal debts. They are repaid over time via a supplementary tax, using a sliding scale based on taxable income. As a consequence, loan repayments are only made when the former student has income to support the repayments. Discounts are available for early repayment. The scheme is available to citizens and permanent humanitarian visa holders. Means-tested scholarships for living expenses are also available. Special assistance is available to indigenous students.

There has been criticism that the HECS-HELP scheme creates an incentive for people to leave the country after graduation, because those who do not file an Australian tax return do not make any repayments.

==Canada==

The province of British Columbia allows the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia to withhold issuance or renewal of driver&#x27;s license to those with delinquent student loan repayments or child support payments or unpaid court fines.
Students need to meet the qualification with an individual&#x27;s direct educational costs and living expense to get the certificate to obtain a loan and this policy is directly controlled by the government.

==France==
== Germany ==
==New Zealand==

New Zealand provides student loans and allowances to tertiary students who satisfy the funding criteria. Full-time students can claim loans for both fees and living costs while part-time students can only claim training institution fees. While the borrower is a resident of New Zealand, no interest is charged on the loan. Loans are repaid when the borrower starts working and has income above the minimum threshold, once this occurs employers will deduct the student loan repayments from the salary at a fixed 12c in the dollar rate and these are collected by the New Zealand tax authority.

==Thailand==
The public sector is one of the most important sections in Thailand&#x27;s higher education system. In addition, many public educational organizations usually receive profits from the students&#x27; tuition fees and the governments. Specifically, There are six various sections in the public sector&#x27;s organization: colleges with the limited enrollment，universities which is opening to public, universities which is national autonomous, Rajabhat colleges, Ajamangala Universities of Technology, and polytechnic colleges.

==India==
The Indian government has launched a portal, Vidya Lakshmi, for students seeking educational loans and five banks including SBI, IDBI Bank and Bank of India have integrated their system with the portal. Vidya Lakshmi was launched on the occasion of Independence Day i.e. 15 August 2015 for the benefit of students seeking educational loans. Vidya Lakshmi was developed under three departments of India i.e. Department of Financial Services, Department of Higher Education and Indian Banks Association (IBA). Vidya Lakshmi Portal has been developed under the Pradhan Mantri Vidya Lakshmi Karyakram and announced by the finance minister Shri Arun Jaitley in the budget speech of FY 2015–16. As of August 15, 2020, 37 banks were registered on the Vidya Lakshmi Portal and offered 137 loan schemes 

To bridge the constraint of increasing institutional fees, NSDL e-Governance in India launched the Vidyasaarathi portal to help students seeking scholarship for studies in India or overseas.

The education loan is expected to grow at a rate of 32.3 percent in 2009-10, 39.8 percent each in 2010-11and 2011-12, and 44.8 percent during the period 2012–13 to 2014–15.

==South Korea==

South Korea&#x27;s student loans are managed by the Korea Student Aid Foundation (KOSAF) which was established in May 2009. According to the governmental philosophy that Korea&#x27;s future depends on talent development and no student should quit studying due to financial reasons, they help students grow into talents that serve the nation and society as members of Korea. Normally, in South Korea, the default rate of redemption is related to each student&#x27;s academic personalities. For instance, comparing with other majors, students in fine arts and physics are supposed to possessing a higher default rate. Therefore, students in such majors would be inclined to a higher rate of unemployment and a higher risk of default in redemption. Also, people will tend to have an inferior quality of human capital if the period of unemployment is too long.

== United Kingdom ==

Student loans in the United Kingdom are primarily provided by the state-owned Student Loans Company. Interest begins to accumulate on each loan payment as soon as the student receives it, but repayment is not required until the start of the next tax year after the student completes (or abandons) their education.

Since 1998, repayments have been collected by HMRC via the tax system, and are calculated based on the borrower&#x27;s current level of income. If the borrower&#x27;s income is below a certain threshold (£15,000 per tax year for 2011/2012, £21,000 per tax year for 2012/2013), no repayments are required, though interest continues to accumulate.

Loans are canceled if the borrower dies or becomes permanently unable to work. Depending on when the loan was taken out and which part of the UK the borrower is from, they may also be canceled after a certain period of time usually after 30 years, or when the borrower reaches a certain age.

Student loans taken out between 1990 and 1998, in the introductory phase of the UK government&#x27;s phasing in of student loans, were not subsequently collected through the tax system in the following years. The onus was (and still is) on the loan holder to prove their income falls below an annually calculated threshold set by the government if they wish to defer payment of their loan.
A portfolio of early student loans from the 1990s was sold, by The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in 2013.
Erudio, a company financially backed by CarVal and Arrow Global was established to process applications for deferment and to manage accounts, following its successful purchasing bid of the loan portfolio in 2013.

There are complaints that graduates who have fully repaid their loans are still having £300 a month taken from their accounts and cannot get this stopped.

As of January 2025, student loan borrowers in the United Kingdom on repayment plan five will have their loan canceled after 40 years from when they are due to start making payments.

== United States ==

In the United States, there are two types of student loans: federal loans sponsored by the federal government and private student loans, which broadly includes state-affiliated nonprofits and institutional loans provided by schools. The overwhelming majority of student loans are federal loans. Federal loans can be &quot;subsidized&quot; or &quot;unsubsidized.&quot; Interest does not accrue on subsidized loans while the students are in school. Student loans may be offered as part of a total financial aid package that may also include grants, scholarships, and/or work study opportunities. Whereas interest for most business investments is tax deductible, Student loan interest is generally not deductible. Critics contend that tax disadvantages to investments in education contribute to a shortage of educated labor, inefficiency, and slower economic growth.

Prior to 2010, federal loans were also divided into direct loans (which are originated and funded by the federal government) and guaranteed loans, originated and held by private lenders but guaranteed by the government. The guaranteed lending program was eliminated in 2010 because of a widespread perception that the government guarantees boosted student lending companies&#x27; profits but did not benefit students by reducing student loan costs.

Federal student loans are less expensive than private student loans. The federal government offers direct consolidation loans through the Federal Direct Loan Program. The new interest rate is the weighted average of the previous loans. Private loans don&#x27;t qualify for this program. The interest rate of borrowers with federal student loans is nearly equal to the weighted average rate on the former loans while the new interest rate of private loans depends on the one-month London interbank offered rate. Therefore, these two student loans are different in both application and definition. Students can apply for student loans with the Department of Education which enables any school to take part in its Direct Loan project.

Some believe that the education of workers would bring societal benefits such as reducing stress on public services, reducing medical expenses, increasing incomes, and promoting employment rates. These people propose that federal student loan rates should be adjusted with specific courses, relative to the rate of risk and societal returns from various studies.

The Master Promissory Note is an agreement between the lender and the borrower that promises to repay the loan. It is a binding legal contract.

=== Qualification ===
Most college students in the United States qualify for federal student loans. Students can borrow the same amount of money, at the same price, regardless of their own income or their parents&#x27; incomes, regardless of their expected future income, and regardless of their credit history. Only students who have defaulted on federal student loans or have been convicted of drug offenses, and have not completed a rehabilitation program, are excluded.
The amount students can borrow each year depends on their education level (undergraduate or graduate), and their status as dependent or independent. Undergraduates are eligible for subsidized loans, with no interest while the student is in school. Graduate students can borrow more per year. 

Private lenders use different underwriting criteria, including credit rating, income level, parents&#x27; income level, and other financial considerations. Students only borrow from private lenders when they exhaust the maximum borrowing limits under federal loans. Several scholars have advocated eliminating the borrowing limit on federal loans and enabling students to borrow according to their needs (tuition plus living expenses) and thereby eliminating high-cost private loans.

=== Repayment ===
Traditionally, repayment starts six months after graduation or leaving school. Federal student loan interest rates are established by Congress and listed in § 20 U.S.C. § 1087E(b). Because the interest rates are established by Congress, interest rates are a political decision. In 2010, the federal student loan program ran a multibillion-dollar &quot;negative subsidy&quot;, or profit, for the federal government. 

Financial relief can provide a safety net for those under intense pressure to repay, leading many towards gaining income and avoiding defaulting. With federal student loans, the student may have multiple options for extending the repayment period. An extension of the loan term will reduce the monthly payment and increase the amount of total interest paid on the principal balance during the life of the loan (the unpaid interest and any penalties become capitalized, i.e. added to the loan balance). Extension options include extended payment periods offered by the original lender and federal loan consolidation. There are also other extension options including income-based repayment plans and hardship deferments.

====Income-based repayment====
The Income-based repayment (IBR) plan is an alternative to paying back federal student loans, which allows the borrowers to pay back loans based on how much they make, and not based how much money is actually owed. Income-based repayment is a federal program and is not available for private loans.

IBR plans generally cap loan payments at 10 percent of the student borrower&#x27;s income. Deferred interest accrues, and the balance owed grows. However, after a certain number of years, the balance of the loan is forgiven. This period is 10 years if the student borrower works in the public sector (government or a nonprofit) and 25 years if the student works at a for-profit. Debt forgiveness may be treated as taxable income, but can be excluded as taxable under certain circumstances, like bankruptcy and insolvency. Loans forgiven through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program are not considered taxable income.

=== Rising student debt ===
Federal aid policies expanded loan eligibility and shifted from grants to loans starting the rising student debt. The Federal Pell Grant, a form of federal aid for higher education students that does not need to be re-paid, only provides a maximum annual grant of $6,195 per student for the 2019-2020 award year. With the average annual tuition cost for a four year in-state public university averaging $26,590 for the 2019–2020 academic year, many students are forced to take out student loans to bridge the gap between grants and their annual tuition costs. More students over the years have been actively enrolled in universities, with enrollment in for-profit universities growing by over 5 million in the past 10 years. For-profit universities enroll only 10% of the nations active college enrollment, yet hold nearly 20% of all federal student loan. States have also deprived public support and shifted the financial burden onto students by increasing the cost of tuition. With the median family income on a steady decline each year since 2007 up until 2012, it saw increasing difficulty for students to pay back college tuition out of savings and labor income. Between 2002 and 2012, public spending on education dropped 30%, while total enrollment at public colleges and universities jumped 34%. Ninety-two percent of student debt is loaned directly by the federal government. In 2020, the amount of student loan debt had reached $1.6 trillion.

===Default===
Borrowers from families with low income with separation are more likely to default than those from higher-income families. Default rates on student loans were found to be higher for women than for men. Borrowers entering repayment after their sophomore year are more likely to default.

Loans to graduate and professional students are especially profitable because of high-interest rates and low default rates. Usually, the net flow of the default rate on student loans are strongly related to the nontraditional issuer and the flowing price of the tangible assets. However, in contrast to the positive correlation with the borrower, a change in the price normally leads to a negative influence on the default rate. These two aspects have been used to explain the Great Recession of student loan default, which had grown to nearly thirty percent.

Student loans cannot be discharged in bankruptcy unless repaying the loan would create an &quot;undue hardship&quot; for the student borrower and dependents of the borrower. In 2005, the bankruptcy laws were changed so that private educational loans also could not be readily discharged. Supporters of this change claimed that it would reduce student loan interest rates; critics said it would increase the lenders&#x27; profit.

=== Criticism ===
In coverage through established media outlets, many borrowers have expressed feelings of victimization by the student loan corporations. There is a comparison between these accounts and the college credit card trend in America during the 2000s, though the amounts owed by students on their student loans are almost always higher than the amount owed on credit cards. Student loans cannot be discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding unless the debtor can demonstrate &quot;undue hardship.&quot; After the passage of the bankruptcy reform bill of 2005, even private student loans are not discharged during bankruptcy. This provided a credit risk free loan for the lender, averaging 7 percent a year.

In 2007, Andrew Cuomo, then Attorney General of New York State, led an investigation into lending and anti-competitive practices between student lenders and universities. Specifically, many universities steered student borrowers to &quot;preferred lenders&quot; which resulted in those borrowers incurring higher interest rates. Some of these &quot;preferred lenders&quot; allegedly rewarded university financial aid staff with &quot;kickbacks&quot;. This has led to changes in lending policy at many major American universities. Many universities have also rebated millions of dollars in fees back to affected borrowers.

In 2007, a false claims lawsuit was filed on behalf of the federal government by former Department of Education researcher Jon Oberg against Sallie Mae, Nelnet, and other lenders. Oberg argued that the lenders overcharged the U.S. government and defrauded taxpayers of millions and millions of dollars. In August 2010, Nelnet settled the lawsuit and paid $55 million.

Since 2005, Bankruptcy reform lead debtors have to take the responsibility of private student loan debt in bankruptcy which can decline debtors’ intention of reducing costly defaults to declare bankruptcy.

As of 2013, many economists are predicting a new economic crisis will emerge as a result of an estimated $1 trillion of student loan debt currently impacting two thirds of graduating college students in America. However, most economists and investors believe that there is no student loan bubble.

In his 2020 presidential campaign, Joe Biden promised student loan forgiveness. 64% of Americans back student loan forgiveness of $10,000 for individuals earning up to $150,000 annually.

== Hong Kong ==
The loan scheme for Hong Kong students was introduced in 1969. This scheme aimed to help full-time students at two universities: the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Hong Kong University. The program was extended in 1976 to cover full-time students in the Hong Kong Polytechnic, and further extended in 1982 to cover post-advanced level students in the Hong Kong Baptist College. In 1984 loans were expanded to include students in the new city Polytechnic. The scheme is controlled by the secretary of the university and Polytechnic Grants Committee, which is advised by the Joint Committee On Student Finance. The applicant of the loan scheme must have resided or been domiciled in Hong Kong for three years immediately prior to application. In 1990, a new government office, the Student Financial Assistance Agency, was also established to coordinate the administration of the student loan scheme.

<text>Mary Kay Ash (born Mary Kathlyn Wagner; May 12, 1918 – November 22, 2001) was an American businesswoman and founder of Mary Kay Cosmetics, Inc. At her death, she had a fortune of $98 million, and her company had more than $1.2 billion in sales with a sales force of more than 800,000 in at least three dozen countries.

==Early life==
Mary Kay Ash, born Mary Kathlyn Wagner in Hot Wells, Harris County, Texas, was the daughter of Edward Alexander and Lula Vember Hastings Wagner. Her mother was trained as a nurse and later became a manager of a restaurant in Houston. Ash attended Dow Elementary School and Reagan High School in Houston and graduated in 1934.

Ash married Ben Rogers at age 17. They had three children, Ben Jr., Marylin Reed, and Richard Rogers. While her husband served in World War II, she sold books door-to-door. After her husband&#x27;s return in 1945, they divorced. She later married Charles Weaver, the brother of Mary C. Crowley founder of Home Interiors and Gifts.

==Career==
Ash went to work for Stanley Home Products in 1939. Frustrated when passed over for a promotion in favor of a man that she had trained, Ash retired in 1963 and intended to write a book to assist women in business. The book turned into a business plan for her ideal company, and in the summer of 1963, Mary Kay Ash and her new husband, George Hallenbeck, planned to start Mary Kay Cosmetics. However, George died of a heart attack that same year. Ash was 45 years old.

One month after George&#x27;s death, with a $5,000 investment from her oldest son, Ben Rogers, Jr., Ash started Mary Kay Cosmetics. Richard Rogers took George&#x27;s place in the company. The company started its original storefront operation &quot;Beauty By Mary Kay&quot; in Dallas. They used a 500‐square‐foot storefront with nine saleswomen signed up. Ash copied the same “house party” model used by Stanley, Tupperware, and others. A Mary Kay representative would invite her friends over for free facials, then pitch the products. Profits rolled in, with double‐digit growth every year.

According to Gavenas:
: Mary Kay was a very visible, very active, and almost ridiculously feminine‐looking role model: a God‐fearing, hard‐working, immaculately groomed mother of three who was doing everything within her power to see other women get ahead, and who loved mentoring so much that she referred to her saleswomen as her “daughters.” Also unlike Avon, Mary Kay made her saleswomen more profit per unit: a Mary Kay lipstick cost roughly double the price of an Avon lipstick and hence made twice the profit, while the home‐party format meant that several customers could be approached at once...Mary Kay made her company purposely inclusive, enabling her rapid expansion into Australia, South America, Europe, and Asia.

==Awards==
Both during her life and posthumously, Ash received numerous honors from business groups, including the Horatio Alger Award. In 1980, Ash received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Ash was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1996. A long-time fundraiser for charities, she founded the Mary Kay Ash Charitable Foundation in 1996 to raise money to combat domestic violence and cancers affecting women. Ash served as Mary Kay Cosmetics&#x27; chairman until 1987 when she was named Chairman Emeritus. &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine recognized Mary Kay Inc. with inclusion in &quot;The 100 best companies to work for in America&quot;. The company was also named one of the best 10 companies for women to work for. Her last acknowledgments while she was still alive were the &quot;Equal Justice Award&quot; from Legal Services of North Texas in 2001 and &quot;Most Outstanding Woman in Business in the 20th Century&quot; from Lifetime Television in 1999.

==Mary Kay Cosmetics, Inc.==
Ash and her partners, which included her son Richard, took the company public in 1968. Seventeen years later, in 1985, the Mary Kay Cosmetics board decided to make the company private again. Ash remained active in Mary Kay Cosmetics, Inc. until suffering a stroke in 1996. Richard Rogers was named CEO of Mary Kay Cosmetics, Inc. in 2001. At the time of Ash&#x27;s death, Mary Kay Cosmetics had over 800,000 representatives in 37 countries, with total annual sales of over $200 million.

==Books==
Ash was the author of several books, including &quot;Mary Kay&quot;, an autobiography in 1994 and &quot;Miracles Happen&quot; and &quot;You Can Have It All&quot; in 1995. Her first book, called &quot;Mary Kay on People Management,&quot; was published in 1984 and was on the New York Times Best Seller List.

==Death==
Mary Kay Ash died on November 22, 2001. She is interred in the Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery in Dallas, Texas.

<doc id="465004" wikidata="Q936847" url="?curid=465004" title="1957 Canadian federal election">
<text>The 1957 Canadian federal election was held June 10, 1957, to select the 265 members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 23rd Parliament of Canada. In one of the greatest upsets in Canadian political history, the Progressive Conservative Party (also known as &quot;PCs&quot; or &quot;Tories&quot;), led by John Diefenbaker, brought an end to 22 years of Liberal rule, as the Tories were able to form a minority government despite losing the popular vote to the Liberals.

The Liberal Party had governed Canada since 1935, winning five consecutive elections. Under Prime Ministers William Lyon Mackenzie King and Louis St. Laurent, the government gradually built a welfare state. During the Liberals&#x27; fifth term in office, the opposition parties depicted them as arrogant and unresponsive to Canadians&#x27; needs. Controversial events, such as the 1956 &quot;Pipeline Debate&quot; over the construction of the Trans-Canada Pipeline, had hurt the government. St. Laurent, nicknamed &quot;Uncle Louis&quot;, remained popular, but exercised little supervision over his cabinet ministers.

In 1956, Tory leader George A. Drew unexpectedly resigned due to ill health. In his place, the PC party elected the fiery and charismatic Diefenbaker. The Tories ran a campaign centred on their new leader, who attracted large crowds to rallies and made a strong impression on television. The Liberals ran a lacklustre campaign, and St. Laurent made few television appearances. Uncomfortable with the medium, the Prime Minister read his speeches from a script and refused to wear makeup.

Abandoning their usual strategy of trying to make major inroads in Liberal-dominated Quebec, the Tories focused on winning seats in the other provinces. They were successful; though they gained few seats in Quebec, they won 112 seats overall to the Liberals&#x27; 105. With the remaining seats won by other parties, the PC party only had a plurality in the House of Commons, but the margin was sufficient to make John Diefenbaker Canada&#x27;s first Tory Prime Minister since R. B. Bennett in 1935.

== Background ==

=== Liberal domination ===
The Tories had last governed Canada under R.B. Bennett, who had been elected in 1930. Bennett&#x27;s government had limited success in dealing with the Depression, and was defeated in 1935, as Liberal William Lyon Mackenzie King, who had previously served two times as prime minister, was restored to power. The Liberals won five consecutive elections between 1935 and 1953, four of the victories resulting in powerful majority governments. The Liberals worked closely with the civil service (drawing several of their ministers from those ranks) and their years of dominance saw prosperity.
When Mackenzie King retired in 1948, he was succeeded by Minister of Justice Louis St. Laurent, a bilingual Quebecer who took office at the age of 66. An adept politician, St. Laurent projected a gentle persona and was affectionately known to many Canadians as Uncle Louis. In actuality, St. Laurent was uncomfortable away from Ottawa, was subject to fits of depression (especially after 1953), and on political trips was carefully managed by advertising men from the firm of Cockfield Brown. St. Laurent led the Liberals to an overwhelming triumph in the 1949 election, campaigning under the slogan &quot;You never had it so good&quot;. The Liberals won a fifth successive mandate in 1953, with St. Laurent content to exercise a highly relaxed leadership style.

The Mackenzie King and St. Laurent governments laid the groundwork for the welfare state, a development initially opposed by many Tories. C.D. Howe, considered one of the leading forces of the St. Laurent government, told his Tory opponents when they alleged that the Liberals would abolish tariffs if the people would let them, &quot;Who would stop us? ... Don&#x27;t take yourselves too seriously. If we wanted to get away with it, who would stop us?&quot;

=== Tory struggles ===
At the start of 1956, the Tories were led by former Ontario premier George A. Drew, who had been elected PC leader in 1948 over Saskatchewan MP John Diefenbaker. Drew was the fifth man to lead the Tories in their 21 years out of power. None had come close to defeating the Liberals; the best performance was in 1945, when John Bracken secured 67 seats for the Tories. The Liberals, though, had won 125 seats, and maintained their majority. In the 1953 election, the PC party won 51 seats out of the 265 in the House of Commons. Subsequently, the Tories picked up two seats from the Liberals in by-elections, and the Liberals (who had won 169 seats in 1953) lost an additional seat to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, the predecessor of the New Democratic Party (NDP)).

After over two decades in opposition, the Tories were closely associated with that role in the public eye. The Tories were seen as the party of the wealthy and of English-speaking Canada and drew about 30% of the vote in federal elections. The Tories had enjoyed little success in Quebec in the past forty years. By 1956, the Social Credit Party was becoming a potential rival to the Tories as Canada&#x27;s main right-wing party. Canadian journalist and author Bruce Hutchison discussed the state of the Tories in 1956:

When a party calling itself Conservative can think of nothing better than to outbid the Government&#x27;s election promises; when it demands economy in one breath and increased spending in the next; when it proposes an immediate tax cut regardless of inflationary results ... when in short, the Conservative party no longer gives us a conservative alternative after twenty-one years ... then our political system desperately requires an opposition prepared to stand for something more than the improbable chance of quick victory.

=== Run-up to the campaign ===

In 1955, the Tories, through a determined filibuster, were able to force the government to withdraw amendments to the Defence Procurement Act, which would have made temporary, extraordinary powers granted to the government permanent. Drew led the Tories in a second battle with the government the following year: in the so-called &quot;Pipeline Debate&quot;, the government invoked closure repeatedly in a weeks-long debate which ended with the Speaker ignoring points of order as he had the division bells rung. Both measures were closely associated with Howe, which, in combination with his earlier comments, led to Tory claims that Howe was indifferent to the democratic process.

Tory preparations for an upcoming election campaign were thrown into disarray in August 1956 when Drew fell ill. Tory leaders felt that the party needed vigorous leadership with a federal election likely to be called within a year. In September, Drew resigned. Diefenbaker, who had failed in two prior bids for the leadership, announced his candidacy, as did Tory frontbenchers Davie Fulton and Donald Fleming. Diefenbaker, a criminal defence lawyer from Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, was on the populist left of the PC party. Those Tory leaders who disliked Diefenbaker and his views, and hoped to find a candidate from Drew&#x27;s conservative wing of the party, wooed University of Toronto president Sidney Smith as a candidate. However, Smith refused to run.

Tory leaders scheduled a leadership convention for December. In early November, the Suez crisis erupted. Minister of External Affairs Lester Pearson played a major part in the settlement of that dispute, and was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role. Diefenbaker, as the Tories&#x27; foreign policy critic and as the favourite in the leadership race, gained considerable attention for his speeches on Suez. The Tories attacked Pearson for, as they said, being an errand boy for the United States government; he responded that it was better to be such a lackey than to be an obedient colonial doing Britain&#x27;s will unquestioningly. While Suez would come to be regarded by many as one of the finest moments in Canadian foreign policy, at the time it cost the Liberals support outside of Quebec.

Diefenbaker was the favourite throughout the leadership campaign. At the convention in Ottawa in December, he refused to abide by the custom of having a Quebecer be either the proposer or seconder of his candidacy, and instead selected an Easterner (from New Brunswick) and a Westerner to put his name in nomination. With most Quebec delegates backing his opponents, Diefenbaker felt that having a Quebecer as a nominator would not increase his support. Diefenbaker was elected on the first ballot, and a number of Quebec delegates walked out of the convention after his victory. Other Diefenbaker opponents, such as those who had urged Smith to run, believed that the 61-year-old Diefenbaker would be merely a caretaker, who would serve a few years and then step down in favour of a younger man, and that the upcoming election would be lost to the Liberals regardless of who led the Tories.

When Parliament convened in January, the Liberals introduced no major proposals, and proposed nothing controversial. Diefenbaker turned over his parliamentary duties to British Columbia MP Howard Green and spent much of his time on the road making speeches across the country. Diefenbaker toured a nation in which Liberal support at the provincial level had slowly been eroding. When the Liberals gained Federal power in 1935, they controlled eight of the nine provincial governments, all except Alberta. By early 1957, the Liberals controlled the legislatures only in the tenth province, Newfoundland, and in Prince Edward Island and Manitoba.

In March, Finance Minister Walter Harris, who was believed to be St. Laurent&#x27;s heir apparent, introduced his budget. The budget anticipated a surplus of $258 million, of which $100 million was to be returned in the form of increased welfare payments, with an increase of $6 per month (to a total of $46) for old age pensioners—effective after the election. Harris indicated that no more could be returned for fear of increasing inflation. Diefenbaker attacked the budget, calling for higher old age pensions and welfare payments, more aid to the poorer provinces, and aid to farmers.

St. Laurent had informed Diefenbaker that Parliament would be dissolved in April, for an election on June 10. A final parliamentary conflict was sparked by the suicide of Canadian Ambassador to Egypt E.H. Norman in the midst of allegations made by a United States Senate subcommittee that Norman had communist links. Pearson had defended Norman when the allegations became public, and defended him again after his death, suggesting to the Commons that the allegations were false. It quickly became apparent that the information released by the Americans might have come from Canadian intelligence sources, and after severe questioning of Pearson by Diefenbaker and the other parties&#x27; foreign policy critics, Pearson made a statement announcing that Norman had had communist associations in his youth, but had passed a security review. The minister evaded further questions regarding what information had been provided, and the discussion was cut short when Parliament was dissolved on April 12.

Peter Regenstreif, who studied the four elections between 1957 and 1963, wrote of the situation at the start of the election campaign, &quot;In 1957, there was no tangible indication that the Liberals would be beaten or, even in the opposition&#x27;s darkest moment of reflection, could be. All the hindsight and &quot;post hoc&quot; gazing at entrails cannot change that objective fact.&quot;

== Issues ==
The Liberals and PC party differed considerably on fiscal and tax policies. In his opening campaign speech at Massey Hall in Toronto, Diefenbaker contended that Canadians were overtaxed in the amount of $120 per family of four. Diefenbaker pledged to reduce taxes and castigated the Liberals for not reducing taxes despite the government surplus. St. Laurent also addressed tax policy in his opening speech, in Winnipeg. St. Laurent noted that since 1953, tax rates had declined, as had the national debt, and that Canada had a reputation as a good place for investments. The Prime Minister argued that the cost of campaign promises made by the Progressive Conservatives would inevitably drive up the tax rate. Diefenbaker also assailed tight-money monetary policies which kept interest rates high, complaining that they were hitting Atlantic and Western Canada hard.

The Tories promised changes in agricultural policies. Many Canadian farmers were unable to find buyers for their wheat; the PC party promised generous cash advances on unsold wheat and promised a protectionist policy regarding foreign agricultural products. The Liberals argued that such tariffs were not worth the loss of bargaining position in efforts to seek foreign markets for Canadian agricultural products.

The institution of the welfare state was by 1957 accepted by both major parties. Diefenbaker promised to expand the national health insurance scheme to cover tubercular and mental health patients. He characterized the old age pension increase which the Liberal government was instituting as a mere pittance, not even enough to keep up with the cost of living. Diefenbaker noted that the increase only amounted to twenty cents a day, using that figure to ridicule Liberal contentions that an increase would add to the rate of inflation. All three opposition parties promised to increase the pension, with the Social Crediters and CCF even stating the specific amounts it would be raised by.

The Liberals were content to rest on their record in foreign affairs, and doubted that the Tories could better them. In a radio address on May 30, Minister of Transport George Marler commented, &quot;You will wonder as I do who in the Conservative Party would take the place of the Honourable Lester Pearson, whose knowledge and experience of world affairs has been put to such good use in recent years.&quot; Diefenbaker, however, refused to concede the point and in a televised address stated that Canadians were &quot;asking Pearson to explain his bumbling of External Affairs&quot;. Though they were reluctant to discuss the Norman affair, the Tories suggested that the government had irresponsibly allowed gossip to be transmitted to United States congressional committees. They also attacked the government over Pearson&#x27;s role in the Suez settlement, suggesting that Canada had let Britain down.

Some members of the Tories&#x27; campaign committee had urged Diefenbaker not to build his campaign around the Pipeline Debate, contending that the episode was now a year in the past and forgotten by the voters, who did not particularly care what went on in Parliament anyway. Diefenbaker replied, &quot;That&#x27;s the issue, and I&#x27;m making it.&quot; Diefenbaker referred to the conduct of the government in the Pipeline Debate more frequently than he did any other issue during the campaign. St. Laurent initially dealt with the question flippantly, suggesting in his opening campaign address that the debate had been &quot;nearly as long as the pipeline itself and quite as full of another kind of natural gas&quot;. As the issue gained resonance with the voters, the Liberals devoted more time to it, and St. Laurent devoted a major part of his final English television address to the question. The Liberals defended their conduct, and contended that a minority should not be allowed to impose its will on an elected majority. St. Laurent suggested that the Tories had performed badly as an opposition in the debate, and suggested that the public give them more practice at being an opposition.

Finally, the Tories contended that the Liberals had been in power too long, and that it was time for a change. The PC party stated that the Liberals were arrogant, inflexible, and not capable of looking at problems from a new point of view. Liberals responded that with the country prosperous, there was no point to a change.

== Campaign ==
=== Progressive Conservative ===
In 1953, almost half of the Tories&#x27; campaign funds were spent in Quebec, a province in which the party won only four of seventy-five seats. After the 1953 election, Tory MP Gordon Churchill studied the Canadian federal elections since Confederation. He concluded that the Progressive Conservatives were ill-advised to continue pouring money into Quebec in an effort to win seats in the province; the Tories could win at least a minority government by maximizing their opportunities in English-speaking Canada, and if the party could also manage to win twenty seats in Quebec, it could attain a majority. Churchill&#x27;s conclusions were ignored by most leading Tories—except Diefenbaker.

Diefenbaker&#x27;s successful leadership race had been run by Allister Grosart, an executive for McKim Advertising Ltd. Soon after taking the leadership, Diefenbaker got Grosart to help out at Tory headquarters, and soon appointed him national director of the party and national campaign manager. Grosart appointed a national campaign committee, something which had not been done previously by the Tories, but which, according to Grosart, provided the organizational key to success in 1957. The party was ill-financed, having only $1,000,000 to wage the campaign—half what it had in 1953. Grosart divided most of that money equally by constituency, to the disgruntlement of Quebec Tories, who were used to receiving a disproportionate share of the national party&#x27;s financing.

The Tory campaign opened at Massey Hall in Toronto on April 25, where Diefenbaker addressed a crowd of 2,600, about 200 short of capacity. At the Massey Hall rally, a large banner hung behind Diefenbaker, which did not mention the name of his party, but which instead stated, &quot;It&#x27;s Time for a Diefenbaker Government.&quot; The slogan, coined by Grosart, sought to blur Canadian memories of the old Tory party of Bennett and Drew and instead focus attention on the party&#x27;s new leader. Posters for election rallies contained Diefenbaker&#x27;s name in large type; only the small print contained the name of the party. When St. Laurent complained that the Tories were not campaigning under their own name, Grosart sent copies of the Prime Minister&#x27;s remarks in a plain envelope to every Liberal candidate, and was gratified when they began inserting the allegation into their own speeches. According to Professor J. Murray Beck in his history of Canadian general elections, &quot;His political enemies were led to make the very point he was striving to drive home: Diefenbaker was, in effect, leading a new party, not an old one with a repellent image.&quot; Grosart later stated that he structured the entire campaign around the personality of John Diefenbaker, and threw away the Tory party and its policies.

Diefenbaker began his campaign with a week of local campaigning in his riding, after which he went to Toronto for the Massey Hall speech. After two days in Ontario, he spoke at a rally in Quebec City, before spending the remainder of the first week in the Maritimes. The next week saw Diefenbaker spend two days in Quebec, after which he campaigned in Ontario. The next two weeks included a Western tour, with brief returns to Ontario, the most populous province. The final two weeks saw Diefenbaker spend much of the time in Ontario, though with brief journeys east to the Maritimes and Quebec and twice west to Saskatchewan. He returned to his riding for the final weekend before the Monday election. He spent 39 days on the campaign trail, eleven more than the Prime Minister.

According to Professor John Meisel, who wrote a book about the 1957 campaign, Diefenbaker&#x27;s speaking style was &quot;reminiscent of the fiery orators so popular in the nineteenth century. Indeed, Mr. Diefenbaker&#x27;s oratory has been likened to that of the revivalist preacher.&quot; As a new face on the national scene given to outspoken attacks on the government, he began to attract unexpectedly large crowds early in the campaign. When reduced to the written word, however, Diefenbaker&#x27;s rhetoric sometimes proved to be without much meaning. According to journalist and author Peter C. Newman, &quot;On the printed page, it makes little sense. But from the platform, its effect was far different.&quot; Both Newman and Meisel cite as an example of this the conclusion to the leader&#x27;s Massey Hall speech:
If we are dedicated to this—and to this we are—you, my fellow Canadians, will require all the wisdom, all the power that comes from those spiritual springs that make freedom possible—all the wisdom, all the faith and all the vision which the Conservative Party gave but yesterday under Macdonald, change to meet changing conditions, today having the responsibility of this party to lay the foundations of this nation for a great and glorious future.

Diefenbaker&#x27;s speeches contained words which evoked powerful emotions in his listeners. His theme was that Canada was on the edge of greatness—if it could only get rid of its incompetent and arrogant government. He stressed that the only alternative to the Liberals was a &quot;Diefenbaker government&quot;. According to Newman, Diefenbaker successfully drew on the discontent both of those who had prospered in the 1950s, and sought some deeper personal and national purpose, as well as those who had been left out of the prosperity. However, Diefenbaker spoke French badly and the excitement generated by his campaign had little effect in francophone Quebec, where apathy prevailed and &quot;Le Devoir&quot; spoke of &quot;&quot;.

The Tories had performed badly in British Columbia in 1953, finishing a weak fourth. However, the province responded to Diefenbaker, and 3,800 turned out for his Victoria speech on May 21, his largest crowd yet. This was bettered two days later in Vancouver with a crowd of 6,000, with even the street outside the Georgia Street Auditorium packed with Tory partisans. Diefenbaker responded to this by delivering what Dick Spencer (who wrote a book on Diefenbaker&#x27;s campaigns) considered his greatest speech of the 1957 race, and which Newman considered the turning point of Diefenbaker&#x27;s campaign. Diefenbaker stated, &quot;I give this assurance to Canadians—that the government shall be the servant and not the master of the people ... The road of the Liberal party, unless it is stopped—and Howe has said, &#x27;Who&#x27;s going to stop us?&#x27;—will lead to the virtual extinction of parliamentary government. You will have the form, but the substance will be gone.&quot;

The Liberal-leaning &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot;, writing shortly after Diefenbaker&#x27;s speeches in British Columbia, commented on them:

Facts were overwhelmed with sound, passion substituted for arithmetic, moral indignation pumped up to the bursting point. But Mr. Diefenbaker provided the liveliest show of the election ... and many listeners undoubtedly failed to notice that he was saying even less than the Prime Minister, though saying it more shrilly and with evangelistic fervour ... Mr. Diefenbaker has chosen instead to cast himself as the humble man in a mood of protest, the common Canadian outraged by Liberal prosperity, the little guy fighting for his rights.
So far as the crowds mean anything, that posture is a brilliant success at one-night stands.
On June 6, the two major party campaigns crossed paths in Woodstock, Ontario. Speaking in the afternoon, St. Laurent drew a crowd of 200. To the shock of St. Laurent staffers, who remained for the Diefenbaker appearance, the PC leader drew an overflow crowd of over a thousand that evening, even though he was an hour late, with announcements made to the excited crowd that he was slowed by voters who wanted only to see him or shake his hand.

Diefenbaker&#x27;s intensive campaign exhausted the handful of national reporters who followed him. Clark Davey of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; stated, &quot;We did not know how he did it.&quot; Reporters thought the Progressive Conservatives might, at best, gain 30 or 35 seats over the 53 they had at dissolution, and when Diefenbaker, off the record, told the reporters that the Tories would win 97 seats (which would still allow the Liberals to form the government), they concluded he was guilty of wishful thinking. Diefenbaker was even more confident in public; after he concluded his national tour and returned to his constituency, he addressed his final rally in Nipawin, Saskatchewan: &quot;On Monday, I&#x27;ll be Prime Minister.&quot;

=== Liberal ===

St. Laurent was utterly confident of an election victory, so much so that he did not even bother to fill the sixteen vacancies in the Senate. He had been confident of re-election when Drew led the Tories, and, according to Liberal minister Lionel Chevrier, Diefenbaker&#x27;s victory in the party leadership race increased his confidence by a factor of ten. At his press conference detailing his election tour, St. Laurent stated, &quot;I have no doubt about the election outcome.&quot; He indicated that his campaign would open April 29 in Winnipeg, and that the Prime Minister would spend ten days in Western Canada before moving east. However, he indicated he would first go home to Quebec City for several days around Easter (April 21 in 1957). This break kept him out of the limelight for ten days at a time when Diefenbaker was already actively campaigning and making daily headlines. At a campaign stop in Jarvis, Ontario, St. Laurent told an aide that he was afraid the right-wing, anti-Catholic Social Credit Party would be the next Opposition. St. Laurent denied Opposition claims that he would resign after an election victory, and the 75-year-old indicated that he planned to run again in 1961, if he was still around.

The Liberals made no new, radical proposals during their campaign, but instead ran a quiet campaign with occasional attacks on the opposition parties. They were convinced that the public still supported their party, and that no expensive promises need be made to voters. St. Laurent was made the image of the nation&#x27;s prosperity, and the Liberals refused to admit any reason for discontent existed. When Minister of Finance Harris proposed raising the upcoming increase in old age pension by an additional four dollars a month, St. Laurent refused to consider it, feeling that the increase had been calculated on the basis of the available facts, and those facts had not changed.

During the Prime Minister&#x27;s Western swing, St. Laurent made formal speeches only in major cities. In contrast to Diefenbaker&#x27;s whistle-stop train touring, with a hasty speech in each town as the train passed through, the Liberals allowed ample time for &quot;Uncle Louis&quot; to shake hands with voters, pat their children on the head, and kiss their babies. In British Columbia, St. Laurent took the position that there were hardly any national issues worth discussing—the Liberals had brought Canada prosperity and all that was needed for more of the same was to return the party to office. After touring Western Canada, St. Laurent spent the remainder of the second week of the campaign returning to, and in, Ottawa. The third week opened with a major speech in Quebec City, followed by intensive campaigning in Ontario. The fifth week was devoted to the Maritime provinces and Eastern Quebec. The sixth week opened with a major rally in Ottawa, before St. Laurent returned to the Maritimes and Quebec, and the final week was spent in Ontario before St. Laurent returned to his hometown of Quebec City for the election.

St. Laurent tried to project an image as a family man, and to that end often addressed schoolchildren. As he had in previous elections, he spoke to small groups of children regarding Canadian history or civics. The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope, Ontario. With the children inattentive, some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face, St. Laurent angrily told them that it was their loss if they did not pay attention, as the country would be theirs to worry about far longer than it would be his.
St. Laurent and the Liberals suffered other problems during the campaign. According to Newman, St. Laurent sometimes seemed unaware of what was happening around him, and at one campaign stop, shook hands with the reporters who were following him, under the apparent impression they were local voters. On the evening of Diefenbaker&#x27;s Vancouver speech, St. Laurent drew 400 voters to a rally in Sherbrooke, Quebec, where he had once lived. C.D. Howe, under heavy pressure from the campaign of CCF candidate Doug Fisher in his Ontario riding, intimated that Fisher had communist links. At a rally in Manitoba, Howe offended a voter who told him the farmers were starving to death, poking the voter in the stomach and saying &quot;Looks like you&#x27;ve been eating pretty well under a Liberal government.&quot; At another rally, Howe dismissed a persistent Liberal questioner, saying &quot;Look here, my good man, when the election comes, why don&#x27;t you just go away and vote for the party you support? In fact, why don&#x27;t you just go away?&quot;

The Liberals concluded their campaign with a large rally at Toronto&#x27;s Maple Leaf Gardens on June 7. Entertainment at the event was provided by the Leslie Bell singers, and according to Grosart, many in the audience were Tory supporters who had turned out to hear them. St. Laurent&#x27;s speech at the rally was interrupted when William Hatton, a 15-year-old boy from Malton, Ontario, climbed onto the platform. Hatton carried a banner reading, &quot;This Can&#x27;t Be Canada&quot; with a Liberal placard bearing St. Laurent&#x27;s photograph, and moved to face the Prime Minister. Meisel describes Hatton as an &quot;otherwise politically apathetic boy who ... slowly and deliberately tore up a photograph of the Prime Minister as the latter was speaking&quot; and states that Hatton engaged in &quot;intensely provocative behavior&quot;. Liberal partisans interceded, and in the ensuing fracas, Hatton fell from the platform, audibly hitting his head on the concrete floor. St. Laurent watched in apparent shock, according to his biographer Dale Tompson, as officials aided the boy and took him from the hall. According to Tompson, the crowd &quot;turned its indignation on the men on the platform&quot; and spent the remainder of the evening wondering about the boy&#x27;s possible injuries rather than listening to the Prime Minister&#x27;s speech. Hatton was not seriously injured, but, according to Newman, &quot;the accident added to the image of the Liberal Party as an unrepentant arrogant group of old men, willing to ride roughshod over voters&quot;. Grosart later described the incident as &quot;the turning point&quot; of the campaign. Professor Meisel speculated that the Hatton incident might have been part of an organized campaign to annoy St. Laurent out of his pleasant &quot;Uncle Louis&quot; persona, and Grosart later related that Liberal frontbencher Jack Pickersgill always accused him of being behind the boy&#x27;s actions, but that the incident was &quot;a sheer accident&quot;. Hatton&#x27;s mother described his actions as &quot;[j]ust a schoolboy prank,&quot; and a reaction to reading an article about how the art of heckling was dying. According to public relations executive J.G. Johnston in a letter to Diefenbaker on June 10, Hatton had come to the rally with several other boys, including Johnston&#x27;s son, but had gone off on his own while the other boys paraded with Diefenbaker posters which had been smuggled inside. According to Johnston, Hatton was caught on CBC tape saying to St. Laurent, &quot;I can no longer stand your hypocrisy, Sir&quot; before tearing the St. Laurent poster. Attempts by Johnston to have the Liberal activist who pushed Hatton off the platform arrested failed, according to Johnston, on the ground that the police could find no witnesses.

=== CCF ===
The CCF was a socialist party, which had much of its strength in Saskatchewan, though it ran candidates in several other provinces. At Parliament&#x27;s dissolution in April 1957, it had 23 MPs, from five different provinces. Aside from the Liberals and the Tories, it was the only party to nominate a candidate in a majority of the ridings. In 1957, the party was led by Saskatchewan MP M.J. Coldwell.

In 1956, the party adopted the Winnipeg Declaration, a far more moderate proposal than its previous governing document, the 1933 Regina Manifesto. For example, the Regina Manifesto pledged the CCF to the eradication of capitalism; the Winnipeg Declaration recognized the utility of private ownership of business, and stated that the government should own business only when it was in the public interest. In its election campaign, the CCF did not promise to nationalize any industries. It promised changes in the tax code in order to increase the redistribution of wealth in Canada. It pledged to increase exemptions from income tax, to allow medical expenses to be considered deductions from income for tax purposes, and to eliminate sales tax on food, clothing, and other necessities of life. It also promised to raise taxes on the higher income brackets and to eliminate the favourable tax treatment of corporate dividends.

The CCF represented many agricultural areas in the Commons, and it proposed several measures to assure financial security for farmers. It proposed national growers&#x27; cooperatives for agricultural products which were exported. It proposed cash advances for farm-stored wheat, short and long-term loans for farmers at low interest rates, and government support of prices, to assure the farmer a full income even in bad years. For the Atlantic fisherman, the CCF proposed cash advances at the start of the fishing season and government-owned depots which would sell fishing equipment and supplies to fishermen at much lower than market prices.

Coldwell suffered from a heart condition, and undertook a much less ambitious schedule than the major party leaders. The party leader left Ottawa for his riding, Rosetown—Biggar in Saskatchewan, on April 26, and remained there until May 10. He spent three days campaigning in Ontario, then moved west to the major cities of the prairie provinces and British Columbia, before returning to his riding for the final days before the June 10 election. Other CCF leaders took charge of campaigning in Quebec and the Maritimes.

=== Social Credit ===
By 1957, the Social Credit Party of Canada had moved far afield from the theories of social credit economics, which its candidates rarely mentioned. Canada&#x27;s far-right party, the Socreds were led by Solon Low, though its Alberta leader, Premier Ernest Manning, was highly influential in the party. The Socreds&#x27; election programme was based on the demand &quot;that Government get out of business and make way for private enterprise&quot; and on their hatred of &quot;all government-inspired schemes to degrade man and make him subservient to the state or any monopoly&quot;.

The Socreds proposed an increase in the old age pension to $100 per month. They called for the reversal of the government&#x27;s tight money policies, and for low income loans for small business and farmers. It asked for income tax exemptions to be increased to meet the cost of living, and a national housing programme to make home ownership possible for every Canadian family. The party called for a national security policy based on the need for defence, rather than &quot;aggression&quot;, and for a foreign policy which would include food aid to the less-developed nations.

The Socreds also objected to the CBC and other spending in the arts and broadcasting. The party felt that the government should solve economic problems before spending money on the arts.

Low challenged the Prime Minister over the Suez issue, accusing him of sending a threatening telegram that caused British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to back off the invasion and so gave the Soviets the opportunity for a military buildup in Egypt. St. Laurent angrily denied the charge and offered to open his correspondence to any of the fifty privy councillors who could then announce whether St. Laurent was telling the truth. Low took St. Laurent up on his challenge, and selected the only living former prime minister, Tory Arthur Meighen, but the matter was not resolved before the election, and Meighen was not called upon to examine the correspondence in the election&#x27;s aftermath.

The Social Credit Party was weakened by considerable conflict between its organizations in the two provinces it controlled, Alberta and British Columbia. It failed to establish a strong national office to run the campaign due to infighting between the two groups. However, it was better financed than the CCF, due to its popularity among business groups in the West.

The Socreds hoped to establish themselves in Ontario, and scheduled their opening rally for Massey Hall in Toronto. The rally was a failure, and even though it ran 40 candidates in Ontario (up from 9 in 1953), the party won no seats in the province.

=== Use of television ===
In 1957, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation gave the four recognized parties free air time for political statements. The television broadcast&#x27;s audio tracks served also for use on radio. The three opposition parties gave their party leader all of the broadcast time, though Diefenbaker, who did not speak French well, played only a limited role in the Tories&#x27; French-language broadcasts. In one, he introduced party president Léon Balcer, a Quebecer, who gave the speech. Diefenbaker had no objection to makeup and, according to Meisel, was prepared to adopt any technique which would make his presentation more effective. A survey in populous southwestern Ontario showed that Diefenbaker made the strongest impression of the four leaders.

According to Liberal minister Paul Martin Sr. (the father of the future Prime Minister), St. Laurent had the potential to be quite good on television, but disliked the medium. He was prejudiced against television appearances, considering such speeches the equivalent of carefully planned performances, such as stage shows. He refused to be made up for the telecasts, and insisted on reading his speech from a script. His advisers switched him to a teleprompter, but this failed to make his performances more relaxed. When reading, he would rarely look at the camera. However, St. Laurent made only occasional television appearances (three in each language), letting his ministers make the remainder. Only one cabinet member, Minister of National Defence Ralph Campney took advantage of the course in television techniques offered by the Liberal Party in a dummy studio in its Ottawa headquarters. This lack of preparation, according to Meisel, led to &quot;a fiasco&quot; during a television address by Minister of Justice Stuart Garson in early June when the teleprompter stopped working during the speech and Garson &quot;was unable to cope effectively with the failure&quot;.

== Election ==
Most predictions had the Tories picking up seats, but the Liberals maintaining a majority. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Liberals expected to lose a majority of Ontario&#x27;s seats, but retain a narrow majority in the House of Commons. &quot;Time&quot; magazine predicted a Tory gain of 20 to 40 seats and stated that any result which denied the Liberals 133 seats and a majority &quot;would rank as a major upset&quot;. Beck indicates that many journalists, including those sympathetic to the Tories, saw signs of the coming upset, but disregarded them, convinced that the government was invulnerable. &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, which printed its postelection issue before the election to go on sale the morning after, ran an editorial noting that Canadians had freely chosen to reelect the Liberal Party.

On Election Night, the first returns came in from Sable Island, Nova Scotia. Usually a Liberal stronghold, the handful of residents there favoured the Tories by two votes. St. Laurent listened to the election returns on a radio in the living room of his home on Grande Allée in Quebec City, and when the radio broke, moved to an upstairs television set. Diefenbaker began the evening at his house in Prince Albert, and once his re-election to the Commons was certain, moved to his local campaign headquarters.

The Conservatives did well in Atlantic Canada, gaining two seats in Newfoundland and nine in Nova Scotia, and sweeping Prince Edward Island&#x27;s four seats. However, in Quebec, they gained only five seats as the province returned 62 Liberals. The Tories gained 29 seats in Ontario. Howe was defeated by Fisher, and told the media that some strange disease was sweeping the country, but as for him, he was going to bed. The Liberals still led by a narrow margin as the returns began to come in from Manitoba, and St. Laurent told Liberal minister Pickersgill that he hoped that the Tories would get at least one more seat than the Liberals so they could get out of an appalling situation. As the Tories forged ahead in Western Canada, Diefenbaker flew from Prince Albert to Regina to deliver a television address and shouted to Grosart as yet another cabinet minister was defeated, &quot;Allister, how does the architect feel?&quot; Late that evening, St. Laurent went to the Château Frontenac hotel for a televised speech, delivered before fifty supporters.

The Tories finished with 112 seats to the Liberals&#x27; 105, while both the CCF and Social Credit gained seats in Western Canada and finished with 25 and 19 seats respectively. Nine cabinet ministers, including Howe, Marler, Garson, Campney and Harris were defeated. Though the Liberals outpolled the Tories by over 100,000 votes, most of those votes were wasted running up huge margins in Quebec. St. Laurent could have constitutionally hung onto power until defeated in the House, but he chose not to, and John Diefenbaker took office as Prime Minister of Canada on June 21, 1957.

=== Irregularities ===
After the election, the Chief Electoral Officer reported to the Speaker of the House of Commons that &quot;the general election appears to have been satisfactorily conducted in accordance with the procedure in the Canada Elections Act&quot;.

There were, however, a number of irregularities. In the Toronto riding of St. Paul&#x27;s, four Liberal workers were convicted of various offences for adding almost five hundred names to the electoral register. One of the four was also convicted for two counts of perjury. While the unsuccessful Liberal candidate, former MP James Rooney, was not charged, Ontario Chief Justice James Chalmers McRuer, who investigated the matter, doubted that this could have been done without the candidate&#x27;s knowledge.

Various violations of law, including illicitly opening ballot boxes, illegal possession of ballots, and adding names to the electoral register, took place in twelve Quebec ridings. The RCMP felt it had enough evidence to prosecute in five ridings, and a total of twelve people were convicted. The offences did not affect the outcome of any races.

The election of the Liberal candidate in Yukon was contested by the losing Tory candidate. After a trial before the Yukon Territorial Court, that court voided the election, holding that enough ineligible people had been permitted to vote to affect the outcome, though the court noted that it was not the fault of the Liberal candidate that these irregularities had occurred. The Tory, Erik Nielsen, won the new election in December 1957.

The election in one Ontario riding, Wellington South was postponed pursuant to statute after the death of the Liberal candidate and MP, Henry Alfred Hosking during the campaign. The Tory candidate, Alfred Hales, defeated Liberal David Tolton and CCF candidate Thomas Withers on July 15, 1957.

== Impact ==

The unexpected defeat of the Liberals was ascribed to various causes. The &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; stated that the defeat could be attributed to &quot;the uneasy talk ... that the Liberals have been in too long.&quot; Tom Kent of the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot;, a future Liberal deputy minister, wrote that though the Liberal record had been the best in the democratic world, the party had failed miserably to explain it. Author and political scientist H.S. Ferns disagreed with Kent, stating that Kent&#x27;s view reflected the Liberal &quot;assumption that &#x27;Nobody&#x27;s going to shoot Santa Claus and that Canadians in the 1957 election were motivated by things other than material interests. Peter Regenstreif cited the Progressive Conservative strategy in the 1957 and 1958 elections &quot;as classics of ingenuity unequalled in Canadian political history. Much of the credit belongs to Diefenbaker himself; at least some must go to Allister Grosart&quot;. A survey taken of those who abandoned the Liberals in 1957 showed that 5.1% did so because of Suez, 38.2% because of the Pipeline Debate, 26.7% because of what they considered an inadequate increase in the old age pension, and 30% because it was time for a change.

The results of the election surprised the civil service as much as it did the rest of the public. Civil servant and future Liberal minister Mitchell Sharp asked C.D. Howe&#x27;s replacement as Minister of Trade and Commerce, Gordon Churchill, not to come to the Ministry&#x27;s offices for several days as they were redecorating. Churchill later learned that the staff were moving files out. When Churchill finally came to the Ministry&#x27;s offices, he was met with what he termed &quot;the coldest reception that I have ever received in my life&quot;. The new Minister of Labour, Michael Starr, was ticketed three days in a row for parking in the minister&#x27;s spot.

St. Laurent resigned as leader of the Liberal Party on September 5, 1957, but agreed to stay on until a successor was elected. With a lame-duck leader, the Liberals were ineffective in opposition. Paul Martin stated that &quot;I&#x27;m sure I never thought the day would come when [Diefenbaker] would ever be a member of a government, let alone head of it. When that happened, the world had come to an end as far as I was concerned.&quot; In January 1958, St. Laurent was succeeded by Lester Pearson.

Even in reporting the election result, newspapers suggested that Diefenbaker would soon call another election and seek a majority. Quebec Tory MP William Hamilton (who would soon become Postmaster General under Diefenbaker) predicted on the evening of June 10 that there would soon be another election, in which the Tories would do much better in Quebec. The Tory government initially proved popular among the Canadian people, and shortly after Pearson became Liberal leader, Diefenbaker called a snap election. On March 31, 1958, the Tories won the greatest landslide in Canadian federal electoral history in terms of the percentage of seats, taking 208 seats (including fifty in Quebec) to the Liberals&#x27; 48, with the CCF winning eight and none for Social Credit.

Michael Bliss, who wrote a survey of the Canadian Prime Ministers, alluded to Howe&#x27;s dismissive comments regarding the Tories as he summed up the 1957 election:
The pipeline debate of 1956 sparked a dramatic opposition stand on the importance of free parliamentary debate. Their arrogance did the Grits [Liberals] enormous damage, contributing heavily to the government&#x27;s problems in the 1957 general election. Under the glare of television cameras in that campaign, St. Laurent, Howe, and company now appeared to be a lot of wooden, tired old men who had lost touch with Canada. The voters decided to stop them.

== National results ==

Turnout: 74.1% of eligible voters voted.

* The Other 4 seats were (2) Independent, (1) Independent Liberal, (1) Independent PC. One Liberal-Labour candidate was elected and sat with the Liberal caucus, as happened after the 1953 election.

<text>In electromagnetism, an eddy current (also called Foucault&#x27;s current) is a loop of electric current induced within conductors by a changing magnetic field in the conductor according to Faraday&#x27;s law of induction or by the relative motion of a conductor in a magnetic field. Eddy currents flow in closed loops within conductors, in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field. They can be induced within nearby stationary conductors by a time-varying magnetic field created by an AC electromagnet or transformer, for example, or by relative motion between a magnet and a nearby conductor. The magnitude of the current in a given loop is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the area of the loop, and the rate of change of flux, and inversely proportional to the resistivity of the material. When graphed, these circular currents within a piece of metal look vaguely like eddies or whirlpools in a liquid.

By Lenz&#x27;s law, an eddy current creates a magnetic field that opposes the change in the magnetic field that created it, and thus eddy currents react back on the source of the magnetic field. For example, a nearby conductive surface will exert a drag force on a moving magnet that opposes its motion, due to eddy currents induced in the surface by the moving magnetic field. This effect is employed in eddy current brakes which are used to stop rotating power tools quickly when they are turned off. The current flowing through the resistance of the conductor also dissipates energy as heat in the material. Thus eddy currents are a cause of energy loss in alternating current (AC) inductors, transformers, electric motors and generators, and other AC machinery, requiring special construction such as laminated magnetic cores or ferrite cores to minimize them. Eddy currents are also used to heat objects in induction heating furnaces and equipment, and to detect cracks and flaws in metal parts using eddy-current testing instruments.

==Origin of term==
The term &quot;eddy current&quot; comes from analogous currents seen in water in fluid dynamics, causing localised areas of turbulence known as &quot;eddies&quot; giving rise to persistent vortices. Somewhat analogously, eddy currents can take time to build up and can persist for very long times in conductors due to their inductance.

==History==
The first person to observe eddy currents was François Arago (1786–1853), the President of the Council of Ministers of the 2nd French Republic during the brief period 10th May to June 24, 1848 (equivalent to the current position of the French Prime Minister), who was also a mathematician, physicist and astronomer. In 1824 he observed what has been called rotatory magnetism, and that most conductive bodies could be magnetized; these discoveries were completed and explained by Michael Faraday (1791–1867).

In 1834, Emil Lenz stated Lenz&#x27;s law, which says that the direction of induced current flow in an object will be such that its magnetic field will oppose the change of magnetic flux that caused the current flow. Eddy currents produce a secondary field that cancels a part of the external field and causes some of the external flux to avoid the conductor.

French physicist Léon Foucault (1819–1868) is credited with having discovered eddy currents. In September 1855, he discovered that the force required for the rotation of a copper disc becomes greater when it is made to rotate with its rim between the poles of a magnet, the disc at the same time becoming heated by the eddy current induced in the metal. The first use of eddy current for non-destructive testing occurred in 1879 when David E. Hughes used the principles to conduct metallurgical sorting tests.

==Theory==


A magnet induces circular electric currents in a metal sheet moving through its magnetic field. The accompanying diagram shows a metal sheet formula_1 moving to the right with velocity formula_2 under a stationary magnet. The magnetic field formula_3 (in green arrows) from the magnet&#x27;s north pole formula_4 passes down through the metal sheet. 

Since the metal is moving, the magnetic flux through a given area of the sheet is changing. In particular, the part of the sheet moving toward the edge of the magnet (the left side) experiences an increase in magnetic flux density formula_5. This change in magnetic flux, in turn, induces a circular electromotive force (EMF) in the sheet, in accordance with Faraday&#x27;s law of induction, exerting a force on the electrons in the sheet, causing a counterclockwise circular current formula_6 in the sheet. This is an eddy current. Similarly, the part of the sheet moving away from the edge of the magnet (the right side) experiences a decrease in magnetic flux density formula_7, inducing a second eddy current, this time in a clockwise direction. Since the electrons have a negative charge, they move in the opposite direction to the conventional current shown by the arrows. 

Another equivalent way to understand the origin of eddy currents is to see that the free charge carriers (electrons) in the metal sheet are moving with the sheet to the right, so the magnetic field formula_3 exerts a sideways Lorentz force on them given by formula_9. Since the charge formula_10 of the electrons is negative, by the right hand rule the force is to the right looking in the direction of motion of the sheet. So there is a flow of electrons toward the viewer under the magnet. This divides into two parts, flowing right and left around the magnet outside the magnetic field back to the far side of the magnet in two circular eddies. Since the electrons have a negative charge, the direction of conventional current arrows formula_6 shown is in the opposite direction, toward the left under the magnet. 

The electrons collide with the metal lattice atoms, exerting a drag force on the sheet proportional to its velocity. The kinetic energy used to overcome this drag is dissipated as heat by the currents flowing through the metal, so the metal gets warm under the magnet. As described by Ampère&#x27;s circuital law, each of the circular currents in the sheet induces its own magnetic field (marked in blue arrows in the diagram). 

Another way to understand the drag is to observe that in accordance with Lenz&#x27;s law, the induced electromotive force must oppose the change in magnetic flux through the sheet. At the leading edge of the magnet (left side), the anti-clockwise current creates a magnetic field pointing up (as can be shown using the right hand rule), opposing the magnet&#x27;s field. This causes a repulsive force to develop between the sheet and the leading edge of the magnet. In contrast, at the trailing edge (right side), the clockwise current causes a magnetic field pointed down, in the same direction as the magnet&#x27;s field, resulting in an attractive force between the sheet and the trailing edge of the magnet. In both cases, the resulting force is not in the direction of motion of the sheet.

==Properties==
Eddy currents in conductors of non-zero resistivity generate heat as well as electromagnetic forces. The heat can be used for induction heating. The electromagnetic forces can be used for levitation, creating movement, or to give a strong braking effect. Eddy currents can also have undesirable effects, for instance power loss in transformers. In this application, they are minimized with thin plates, by lamination of conductors or other details of conductor shape.

Self-induced eddy currents are responsible for the skin effect in conductors. The latter can be used for non-destructive testing of materials for geometry features, like micro-cracks. A similar effect is the proximity effect, which is caused by externally induced eddy currents.

An object or part of an object experiences steady field intensity and direction where there is still relative motion of the field and the object (for example in the center of the field in the diagram), or unsteady fields where the currents cannot circulate due to the geometry of the conductor. In these situations charges collect on or within the object and these charges then produce static electric potentials that oppose any further current. Currents may be initially associated with the creation of static potentials, but these may be transitory and small.

Eddy currents generate resistive losses that transform some forms of energy, such as kinetic energy, into heat. This Joule heating reduces efficiency of iron-core transformers and electric motors and other devices that use changing magnetic fields. Eddy currents are minimized in these devices by selecting magnetic core materials that have low electrical conductivity (e.g., ferrites or iron powder mixed with resin) or by using thin sheets of magnetic material, known as laminations. Electrons cannot cross the insulating gap between the laminations and so are unable to circulate on wide arcs. Charges gather at the lamination boundaries, in a process analogous to the Hall effect, producing electric fields that oppose any further accumulation of charge and hence suppressing the eddy currents. The shorter the distance between adjacent laminations (i.e., the greater the number of laminations per unit area, perpendicular to the applied field), the greater the suppression of eddy currents.

The conversion of input energy to heat is not always undesirable, however, as there are some practical applications. One is in the brakes of some trains known as eddy current brakes. During braking, the metal wheels are exposed to a magnetic field from an electromagnet, generating eddy currents in the wheels. This eddy current is formed by the movement of the wheels. So, by Lenz&#x27;s law, the magnetic field formed by the eddy current will oppose its cause. Thus the wheel will face a force opposing the initial movement of the wheel. The faster the wheels are spinning, the stronger the effect, meaning that as the train slows the braking force is reduced, producing a smooth stopping motion.

Induction heating makes use of eddy currents to provide heating of metal objects.

===Power dissipation of eddy currents===
Under certain assumptions (uniform material, uniform magnetic field, no skin effect, etc.) the power lost due to eddy currents per unit mass for a thin sheet or wire can be calculated from the following equation:
formula_12
where
* is the power lost per unit mass (W/kg),
* is the peak magnetic field (T),
* is the thickness of the sheet or diameter of the wire (m),
* is the frequency (Hz),
* is a constant equal to 1 for a thin sheet and 2 for a thin wire,
* is the resistivity of the material (Ω m), and
* is the density of the material (kg/m3).

This equation is valid only under the so-called quasi-static conditions, where the frequency of magnetisation does not result in the skin effect; that is, the electromagnetic wave fully penetrates the material.

=== Skin effect ===

In very fast-changing fields, the magnetic field does not penetrate completely into the interior of the material. This &quot;skin effect&quot; renders the above equation invalid. However, in any case increased frequency of the same value of field will always increase eddy currents, even with non-uniform field penetration.

The penetration depth for a good conductor can be calculated from the following equation:
formula_13
where is the penetration depth (m), is the frequency (Hz), is the magnetic permeability of the material (H/m), and is the electrical conductivity of the material (S/m).

===Diffusion equation===
The derivation of a useful equation for modelling the effect of eddy currents in a material starts with the differential, magnetostatic form of Ampère&#x27;s Law, providing an expression for the magnetizing field surrounding a current density :
formula_14

Taking the curl on both sides of this equation and then using a common vector calculus identity for the curl of the curl results in
formula_15

From Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism, , so
formula_16

Using Ohm&#x27;s law, , which relates current density to electric field in terms of a material&#x27;s conductivity , and assuming isotropic homogeneous conductivity, the equation can be written as
formula_17

Using the differential form of Faraday&#x27;s law, , this gives
formula_18

By definition, , where is the magnetization of the material and is the vacuum permeability. The diffusion equation therefore is
formula_19

==Applications==
===Electromagnetic braking===

Eddy current brakes use the drag force created by eddy currents as a brake to slow or stop moving objects. Since there is no contact with a brake shoe or drum, there is no mechanical wear. However, an eddy current brake cannot provide a &quot;holding&quot; torque and so may be used in combination with mechanical brakes, for example, on overhead cranes. Another application is on some roller coasters, where heavy copper plates extending from the car are moved between pairs of very strong permanent magnets. Electrical resistance within the plates causes a dragging effect analogous to friction, which dissipates the kinetic energy of the car. The same technique is used in electromagnetic brakes in railroad cars and to quickly stop the blades in power tools such as circular saws. Using electromagnets, as opposed to permanent magnets, the strength of the magnetic field can be adjusted and so the magnitude of braking effect changed.

===Repulsive effects and levitation===
In a varying magnetic field, the induced currents exhibit diamagnetic-like repulsion effects. A conductive object will experience a repulsion force. This can lift objects against gravity, though with continual power input to replace the energy dissipated by the eddy currents. An example application is separation of aluminum cans from other metals in an eddy current separator. Ferrous metals cling to the magnet, and aluminum (and other non-ferrous conductors) are forced away from the magnet; this can separate a waste stream into ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal.

With a very strong handheld magnet, such as those made from neodymium, one can easily observe a very similar effect by rapidly sweeping the magnet over a coin with only a small separation. Depending on the strength of the magnet, identity of the coin, and separation between the magnet and coin, one may induce the coin to be pushed slightly ahead of the magnet – even if the coin contains no magnetic elements, such as the US penny. Another example involves dropping a strong magnet down a tube of copper – the magnet falls at a dramatically slow pace.

In a perfect conductor with no resistance, surface eddy currents exactly cancel the field inside the conductor, so no magnetic field penetrates the conductor. Since no energy is lost in resistance, eddy currents created when a magnet is brought near the conductor persist even after the magnet is stationary, and can exactly balance the force of gravity, allowing magnetic levitation. Superconductors also exhibit a separate inherently quantum mechanical phenomenon called the Meissner effect in which any magnetic field lines present in the material when it becomes superconducting are expelled, thus the magnetic field in a superconductor is always zero.

Using electromagnets with electronic switching comparable to electronic speed control it is possible to generate electromagnetic fields moving in an arbitrary direction. As described in the section above about eddy current brakes, a non-ferromagnetic conductor surface tends to rest within this moving field. When however this field is moving, a vehicle can be levitated and propelled. This is comparable to a maglev but is not bound to a rail.

===Identification of metals===
In some coin-operated vending machines, eddy currents are used to detect counterfeit coins, or slugs. The coin rolls past a stationary magnet, and eddy currents slow its speed. The strength of the eddy currents, and thus the retardation, depends on the conductivity of the coin&#x27;s metal. Slugs are slowed to a different degree than genuine coins, and this is used to send them into the rejection slot.

===Vibration and position sensing===
Eddy currents are used in certain types of proximity sensors to observe the vibration and position of rotating shafts within their bearings. This technology was originally pioneered in the 1930s by researchers at General Electric using vacuum tube circuitry. In the late 1950s, solid-state versions were developed by Donald E. Bently at Bently Nevada Corporation. These sensors are extremely sensitive to very small displacements making them well suited to observe the minute vibrations (on the order of several thousandths of an inch) in modern turbomachinery. A typical proximity sensor used for vibration monitoring has a scale factor of 200 mV/mil. Widespread use of such sensors in turbomachinery has led to development of industry standards that prescribe their use and application. Examples of such standards are American Petroleum Institute (API) Standard 670 and ISO 7919.

A Ferraris acceleration sensor, also called a Ferraris sensor, is a contactless sensor that uses eddy currents to measure relative acceleration.

===Structural testing===
Eddy current techniques are commonly used for the nondestructive examination (NDE) and condition monitoring of a large variety of metallic structures, including heat exchanger tubes, aircraft fuselage, and aircraft structural components.

===Skin effects===
Eddy currents are the root cause of the skin effect in conductors carrying alternating current.
Similarly, in magnetic materials of finite conductivity, eddy currents cause the confinement of the majority of the magnetic fields to only a couple skin depths of the surface of the material. This effect limits the flux linkage in inductors and transformers having magnetic cores.

<text>In psychoanalytic theory, defence mechanisms are unconscious psychological processes that protect the self from anxiety-producing thoughts and feelings related to internal conflicts and external stressors.

According to this theory, healthy people use different defence mechanisms throughout life. A defence mechanism can become pathological when its persistent use leads to maladaptive behaviour such that the physical or mental health of the individual is adversely affected. Among the purposes of ego defence mechanisms is to protect the mind/self/ego from anxiety or to provide a refuge from a situation with which one cannot currently cope.

Examples of defence mechanisms include: &quot;repression&quot;, the exclusion of unacceptable desires and ideas from consciousness; &quot;identification&quot;, the incorporation of some aspects of an object into oneself; &quot;rationalization&quot;, the justification of one&#x27;s behaviour by using apparently logical reasons that are acceptable to the ego, thereby further suppressing awareness of the unconscious motivations; and &quot;sublimation&quot;, the process of channeling libido into &quot;socially useful&quot; disciplines, such as artistic, cultural, and intellectual pursuits, which indirectly provide gratification for the original drives.

Some psychologists follow a system that ranks defence mechanisms into seven levels, ranging from a high-adaptive defence level to a psychotic defence level. Assessments carried out when analyzing patients such as the Defence Mechanism Rating Scale (DMRS) and Vaillant&#x27;s hierarchy of defense mechanisms have been used and modified for over 40 years to provide numerical data on the state of a person&#x27;s defensive functioning.

== Theories and classifications ==
In the first definitive book on defence mechanisms, &quot;The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence&quot; (1936), Anna Freud enumerated the ten defence mechanisms that appear in the works of her father, Sigmund Freud: repression, regression, reaction formation, isolation, undoing, projection, introjection, turning against one&#x27;s own person, reversal into the opposite, and sublimation or displacement.

Sigmund Freud posited that defence mechanisms work by distorting id impulses into acceptable forms, or by unconscious or conscious blockage of these impulses. Anna Freud considered defense mechanisms as intellectual and motor automatisms of various degrees of complexity, that arose in the process of involuntary and voluntary learning.

Anna Freud introduced the concept of signal anxiety; she stated that it was &quot;not directly a conflicted instinctual tension but a signal occurring in the ego of an anticipated instinctual tension&quot;. The signalling function of anxiety was thus seen as crucial, and biologically adapted to warn the organism of danger or a threat to its equilibrium. The anxiety is felt as an increase in bodily or mental tension, and the signal that the organism receives in this way allows for the possibility of taking defensive action regarding the perceived danger.

Both Freuds studied defence mechanisms, but Anna spent more of her time and research on five main mechanisms: repression, regression, projection, reaction formation, and sublimation. All defence mechanisms are responses to anxiety and how the consciousness and unconscious manage the stress of a social situation.

*&quot;Repression&quot;: the exclusion of unacceptable desires and ideas from consciousness, though in certain circumstances they may resurface in a disguised or distorted form
*&quot;Regression&quot;: falling back into an early state of mental/physical development seen as &quot;less demanding and safer&quot;
*&quot;Projection&quot;: possessing a feeling that is deemed as socially unacceptable and instead of facing it, that feeling or &quot;unconscious urge&quot; is seen in the actions of other people
*&quot;Reaction formation&quot;: acting the opposite way that the unconscious instructs a person to behave, &quot;often exaggerated and obsessive&quot;. For example, if a wife is infatuated with a man who is not her husband, reaction formation may cause her to – rather than cheat – become obsessed with showing her husband signs of love and affection.
*&quot;Sublimation&quot;: seen as the most acceptable of the mechanisms, an expression of anxiety in socially acceptable ways

Otto F. Kernberg (1967) developed a theory of borderline personality organization of which one consequence may be borderline personality disorder. His theory is based on ego psychological object relations theory. Borderline personality organization develops when the child cannot integrate helpful and harmful mental objects together. Kernberg views the use of primitive defence mechanisms as central to this personality organization. Primitive psychological defences are projection, denial, dissociation or splitting and they are called borderline defence mechanisms. Also, devaluation and projective identification are seen as borderline defences.

Robert Plutchik&#x27;s (1979) theory views defences as derivatives of basic emotions, which in turn relate to particular diagnostic structures. According to his theory, reaction formation relates to joy (and manic features), denial relates to acceptance (and histrionic features), repression to fear (and passivity), regression to surprise (and borderline traits), compensation to sadness (and depression), projection to disgust (and paranoia), displacement to anger (and hostility) and intellectualization to anticipation (and obsessionality).

The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (&quot;DSM-IV&quot;) published by the American Psychiatric Association (1994) includes a tentative diagnostic axis for defence mechanisms. This classification is largely based on Vaillant&#x27;s hierarchical view of defences, but has some modifications. Examples include: denial, fantasy, rationalization, regression, isolation, projection, and displacement. However, additional defense mechanisms are still proposed and investigated by different authors. For instance, in 2023, time distortion was proposed in a publication as a newly identified ego defense.

Different theorists have different categorizations and conceptualizations of defence mechanisms. Large reviews of theories of defence mechanisms are available from Paulhus, Fridhandler and Hayes (1997) and Cramer (1991). The &quot;Journal of Personality&quot; published a special issue on defence mechanisms (1998).

== Vaillant&#x27;s categorization ==

Psychiatrist George Eman Vaillant introduced a four-level classification of defence mechanisms: Much of this is derived from his observations while overseeing the Grant study that began in 1937 and is on-going. In monitoring a group of men from their freshman year at Harvard until their deaths, the purpose of the study was to see longitudinally what psychological mechanisms proved to have impact over the course of a lifetime. The hierarchy was seen to correlate well with the capacity to adapt to life. His most comprehensive summary of the on-going study was published in 1977. The focus of the study is to define mental health rather than disorder.

*Level I – pathological defences (psychotic denial, delusional projection)
*Level II – immature defences (fantasy, projection, passive aggression, acting out)
*Level III – neurotic defences (intellectualization, reaction formation, dissociation, displacement, repression)
*Level IV – mature defences (humour, sublimation, suppression, altruism, anticipation)

===Level 1: pathological===
When predominant, the mechanisms on this level are almost always severely pathological. These defences, in conjunction, permit one effectively to rearrange external experiences to eliminate the need to cope with reality. Pathological users of these mechanisms frequently appear irrational or insane to others. These are the &quot;pathological&quot; defences, common in overt psychosis. However, they are normally found in dreams and throughout childhood as well.
They include:
*&quot;Delusional projection&quot;: Delusions about external reality, usually of a persecutory nature
*&quot;Denial&quot;: Refusal to accept external reality because it is too threatening; arguing against an anxiety-provoking stimulus by stating it does not exist; resolution of emotional conflict and reduction of anxiety by refusing to perceive or consciously acknowledge the more unpleasant aspects of external reality
*&quot;Distortion&quot;: A gross reshaping of external reality to meet internal needs

===Level 2: immature===
These mechanisms are often present in adults. These mechanisms lessen distress and anxiety produced by threatening people or by an uncomfortable reality. Excessive use of such defences is seen as socially undesirable, in that they are immature, difficult to deal with and seriously out of touch with reality. These are the so-called &quot;immature&quot; defences and overuse almost always leads to serious problems in a person&#x27;s ability to cope effectively. These defences are often seen in major depression and personality disorders.
They include:
*&quot;Acting out&quot;: Direct expression of an unconscious wish or impulse in action, without conscious awareness of the emotion that drives the expressive behavior
*&quot;Hypochondriasis&quot;: An excessive preoccupation or worry about having a serious illness
*&quot;Passive-aggressive behavior&quot;: Indirect expression of hostility
*&quot;Projection&quot;: A primitive form of paranoia. Projection reduces anxiety by allowing the expression of the undesirable impulses or desires without becoming consciously aware of them; attributing one&#x27;s own unacknowledged, unacceptable, or unwanted thoughts and emotions to another; includes severe prejudice and jealousy, hypervigilance to external danger, and &quot;injustice collecting&quot;, all with the aim of shifting one&#x27;s unacceptable thoughts, feelings and impulses onto someone else, such that those same thoughts, feelings, beliefs and motivations are perceived as being possessed by the other.
*&quot;Schizoid fantasy&quot;: Tendency to retreat into fantasy in order to resolve inner and outer conflicts
*&quot;Splitting&quot;: A primitive defence. Both harmful and helpful impulses are split off and segregated, frequently projected onto someone else. The defended individual segregates experiences into all-good and all-bad categories, with no room for ambiguity and ambivalence. When &quot;splitting&quot; is combined with &quot;projecting&quot;, the undesirable qualities that one unconsciously perceives oneself as possessing, one consciously attributes to another.

===Level 3: neurotic===
These mechanisms are considered neurotic, but fairly common in adults. Such defences have short-term advantages in coping, but can often cause long-term problems in relationships, work and in enjoying life when used as one&#x27;s primary style of coping with the world.
They include:
*&quot;Displacement&quot;: Defence mechanism that shifts sexual or aggressive impulses to a more acceptable or less threatening target; redirecting emotion to a safer outlet; separation of emotion from its real object and redirection of the intense emotion toward someone or something that is less offensive or threatening in order to avoid dealing directly with what is frightening or threatening. 
*&quot;Dissociation&quot;: Temporary drastic modification of one&#x27;s personal identity or character to avoid emotional distress; separation or postponement of a feeling that normally would accompany a situation or thought.
*&quot;Intellectualization&quot;: Excessively analytical or abstract thought patterns, potentially leading to increased distance from one&#x27;s emotions. Used to block out conflicting or disturbing feelings or thoughts.
*&quot;Isolation of affect&quot;: The detachment of emotion from an idea, making it &quot;flat.&quot; Frequently observed in obsessive–compulsive disorder, and in non-disordered people following traumatic events.
*&quot;Reaction formation&quot;: Converting unconscious wishes or impulses that are perceived to be dangerous or unacceptable into their opposites; behaviour that is completely the opposite of what one really wants or feels; taking the opposite belief because the true belief causes anxiety
*&quot;Repression&quot;: The process of attempting to repel desires towards pleasurable instincts, caused by a threat of suffering if the desire is satisfied; the desire is moved to the unconscious in the attempt to prevent it from entering consciousness; seemingly unexplainable naivety, memory lapse or lack of awareness of one&#x27;s own situation and condition; the emotion is conscious, but the idea behind it is absent

===Level 4: mature===
These are commonly found among emotionally healthy adults and are considered mature, even though many have their origins in an immature stage of development. They are conscious processes, adapted through the years in order to optimise success in human society and relationships. The use of these defences enhances pleasure and feelings of control. These defences help to integrate conflicting emotions and thoughts, whilst still remaining effective. Those who use these mechanisms are usually considered virtuous.
Mature defences include:
*&quot;Altruism&quot;: Constructive service to others that brings pleasure and personal satisfaction
*&quot;Anticipation&quot;: Realistic planning for future discomfort
*&quot;Humour&quot;: Overt expression of ideas and feelings (especially those that are unpleasant to focus on or too terrible to talk about directly) that gives pleasure to others. The thoughts retain a portion of their innate distress, but they are &quot;skirted around&quot; by witticism, for example, self-deprecation.
*&quot;Sublimation&quot;: Transformation of unhelpful emotions or instincts into healthy actions, behaviours, or emotions; for example, playing a heavy contact sport such as football or rugby can transform aggression into a game 
*&quot;Suppression&quot;: The conscious decision to delay paying attention to a thought, emotion, or need in order to cope with the present reality; making it possible later to access uncomfortable or distressing emotions whilst accepting them

== Perry&#x27;s defence mechanism rating scale (DMRS) ==
The defence Mechanism Rating Scale (DMRS) includes thirty processes of defence that are divided into 7 categories. Starting from the highest level of adaptiveness these levels include: high-adaptive, obsessional, neurotic, minor image-distorting, disavowal, major image-distorting, and action. The scale was originally created by J. Christopher Perry for the purpose of being able to provide patients with a &quot;defence diagnosis.&quot; Additions have been made by Mariagrazia Di Giuseppe and colleagues to enlarge the application of the DMRS, creating the DMRS self report and DMRS-Q sort.

=== Level 1: Action defences ===
Action defence mechanisms are used unconsciously to help reduce stress. Examples include passive aggression, help-rejecting complaining, and acting out, which channel impulses into appropriate behaviors. These processes offer short-term relief but may prevent lasting improvements in the root causes.

=== Level 2: Major image-distorting defences ===
Major image-distorting mechanisms are used to guard a person&#x27;s own image and their ego from perceived dangers, conflicts, or fears. These processes involve simplifying the way a person sees themselves and others. Splitting of one&#x27;s self or other&#x27;s image and projective identification both work on an unconscious level and help to alter reality, enabling these individuals to uphold a more positive view of their lives or situations.

=== Level 3: Disavowal defences ===
Disavowal defence mechanisms include the rejection or denial of unpleasant ideas, emotions, or events. People sometimes distance themselves from certain parts of their identity, whether they are aware of it or not, in order to avoid feelings of unease or discomfort. Mechanisms such as autistic fantasy, rationalization, denial, and projection, can help shield one&#x27;s ego from feelings of stress or guilt that arise when facing reality.

=== Level 4: Minor image-distorting defences ===
Level four defence mechanisms serve the purpose of protecting an individual&#x27;s self-esteem. There are several processes that people may use, such as devaluation and idealization of self-image and others-image, as well as omnipotence. These mechanisms assist in preserving a healthy self-perception during times of psychological instability.

=== Level 5: Neurotic ===
These defences are strategies that the mind uses without conscious awareness in order to manage anxiety, which is often a result of ongoing conflicts. There are several mechanisms that people use to cope with distressing thoughts and emotions. These include repression, displacement, dissociation, and reaction formation. These defences may offer brief relief; however, they can inhibit development in oneself and contribute to harmful habits.

=== Level 6: Obsessional defences ===
Obsessional defences refer to mental techniques that individuals utilize to cope with anxiety by exerting control over their thoughts, emotions, or behaviors. People may rely on strict routines, a desire for perfection, or a strong need for order to maintain a sense of control and avoid facing uncertainty or undesirable impulses. These defences, such as isolation of affects, intellectualization, and undoing, provide a short-term solution but can result in the development of obsessive-compulsive behaviors and hinder one&#x27;s capacity to express and adapt to emotions.

=== Level 7: High-adaptative defences ===
This level of defences allow individuals to cope with stressors, challenges, and trauma. Mechanisms, such as sublimation, affiliation, self-assertion, suppression, altruism, anticipation, humor, and self-observation play a role in building resilience. They allow individuals to redefine challenges in a beneficial way that maximizes positivity. In doing so, they enhance their psychological well-being and encourage adaptation.

== Relation with coping ==
There are multiple different perspectives on how the construct of &quot;defence&quot; relates to the construct of &quot;coping.&quot; While the two concepts share multiple similarities, there is a distinct difference between them that depends on the state of consciousness the process is carried out in. The process of coping involves using logic and reason to stabilize negative emotions and stressors. This differs from defence, which is driven by impulse and urges.

Similarities between coping and defense mechanisms have been extensively studied in relation to various mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and personality disorders. Research indicates that these mechanisms often follow specific patterns within different disorders, with some, like avoidant coping, potentially exacerbating future symptoms. This aligns with the vulnerability-stress psychopathology model, which involves two core components: vulnerability (non-adaptive mechanisms and processes) and stress (life events). These factors interact to create a threshold for the development of mental disorders. The types of coping and defense mechanisms used can either contribute to vulnerability or act as protective factors. Coping and defence mechanisms work in tandem to balance out feelings of anxiety or guilt, categorizing them both as a &quot;mechanisms of adaptation.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Criticism regarding defence mechanisms focus on the lack of empirical evidence as most of the evidence for defence mechanisms comes from clinical observations and subjective interpretations. 

Critics have stated that due to the difficult nature of studying defence mechanisms that future research should distinguish more between the theoretical constructs of defence mechanisms and actual behaviors.

<text>During World War II, Operation Grenade was the crossing of the Roer river between Roermond and Düren by the U.S. Ninth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General William Hood Simpson, in February 1945, which marked the beginning of the Allied invasion of Germany.

On 9 February, the U.S. Ninth Army—operating under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group since the Battle of the Bulge—was to cross the Roer and link up with the Canadian First Army, under Lieutenant-General Harry Crerar, coming from the Nijmegen area of the Netherlands in Operation Veritable, which had started at 05:00 on 8 February. However, once the Canadians had advanced, the Germans opened the sluice gates of upstream dams (Rur Dam and Urft Dam). This stopped the Americans from crossing as planned. It had been anticipated that the Germans would try to do this, and that General Omar Bradley&#x27;s U.S. 12th Army Group could capture them in time to stop the flooding.

During the two weeks that the river was flooded, Hitler would not allow Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt to withdraw behind the Rhine, arguing that it would only delay the inevitable fight. He ordered him to fight where his forces stood. Those forces comprised the 15th Army, commanded by Gustav-Adolf von Zangen, and the 1st Parachute Army, commanded by Alfred Schlemm. 

The Ninth Army was finally able to cross the river on 23 February. By then, other Allied forces were also close to the Rhine. German forces west of the Rhine during operations Veritable, Blockbuster and Grenade lost 90,000 men, of which more than 50,000 became prisoners of war (POW). Allied casualties amounted to some 23,000 men.

<text>John Canton (31 July 1718 – 22 March 1772) was a British physicist. He was born in Middle Street Stroud, Gloucestershire, to a weaver, John Canton (b. 1687) and Esther (née Davis). As a schoolboy, he became the first person to determine the latitude of Stroud, while making a sundial. The sundial caught the attention of many, including Dr Henry Miles, a Stroud-born Fellow of the Royal Society. Miles encouraged Canton to leave Gloucestershire to become a trainee teacher for Samuel Watkins, the headmaster of a Nonconformist school in Spital Square, London, with whom he ultimately entered into partnership.
In 1750 he read a paper before the Royal Society on a method of making artificial magnets, and was subsequently elected a Fellow of the society (FRS). In 1751 he was a recipient of the Copley Medal &quot;On account of his communicating to the Society, and exhibiting before them, his curious method of making Artificial Magnets without the use of Natural ones.&quot; He was the first in England to verify Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s hypothesis of the identity of lightning and electricity, and he made several important electrical discoveries.

In 1762 and 1764 he published experiments in refutation of the decision of the Florentine Academy, at that time generally accepted, that water is incompressible. In 1768 he described the preparation, by calcining oyster-shell with sulphur, of the phosphorescent material known as Canton&#x27;s phosphorus. His investigations were carried on while he worked as a school teacher. He died in London aged 53 of dropsy.

He was the recipient of letters that formed the foundation for modern day Bayes&#x27; Theorem from Thomas Bayes, which were then published by the Royal Society. John Canton did not receive those letter directly from Bayes, but through an intermediary after the death of Thomas Bayes. Richard Price initially established the communication between Thomas Bayes and John Canton.

Canton is now mainly remembered for his work in electrostatics, particularly the invention of the pith ball electroscope, and his studies in atmospheric electricity. He is honoured with a blue plaque at the site of his old school in his hometown of Stroud.

<text>Clayton Rawson (August 15, 1906 – March 1, 1971) was an American mystery writer, editor, and amateur magician. His four novels frequently invoke his great knowledge of stage magic and feature as their fictional detective The Great Merlini, a professional magician who runs a shop selling magic supplies. He also wrote four short stories in 1940 about a stage magician named Don Diavolo, who appears as a minor character in one of the novels featuring The Great Merlini. &quot;Don Diavolo is a magician who perfects his tricks in a Greenwich Village basement where he is frequently visited by the harried Inspector Church of Homicide, either to arrest the Don for an impossible crime or to ask him to solve it.&quot;

==Life and career==
Rawson was born in Elyria, Ohio, the son of Clarence D. and Clara (Smith) Rawson. He became a magician when he was 8 years old. He married Catherine Stone in 1929, the same year he graduated from Ohio State University, and they had four children. He moved to Chicago and worked there as an illustrator.

His first novel, &quot;Death from a Top Hat&quot;, appeared in 1938.

He was one of the four founding members of the Mystery Writers of America, which presents the annual Edgar Awards in various categories of mystery writing. All of his novels were written before the founding of this group, but in 1949 and 1967 Rawson received Special Edgar Awards for his various contributions to mystery writing and the MWA, including the founding of the organization&#x27;s first newsletter, &quot;The Third Degree&quot;. Rawson is also credited with writing the organization&#x27;s first slogan: &quot;Crime Does Not Pay—Enough&quot;.

Rawson was widely admired by his mystery-writing colleagues, and John Dickson Carr, master of &quot;impossible crime&quot; stories, dedicated the 1965 novel &quot;The House at Satan&#x27;s Elbow&quot; to him. Rawson was managing editor of Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine between 1963 and his death in the United Hospital, Port Chester, N.Y., in 1971.

Rawson&#x27;s burial was apparently in New York. Sometime between 2006 and 2011, his name was inscribed on his parents&#x27; double gravestone at a cemetery in Elyria, Lorain County, Ohio, noting the family connection and honoring a hometown boy who achieved fame. However, he is not buried there. The date of his death in this added inscription is incorrectly listed as 1970.

==Works on the screen==

At least two movies were made based on the Merlini books. One of them, &quot;Miracles for Sale&quot; (1939), was based on &quot;Death from a Top Hat&quot; but had no character named Merlini. Instead, Robert Young played the character as &quot;The Great Morgan&quot;. The movie &quot;The Man Who Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot; (1942), starring Lloyd Nolan, was based on &quot;No Coffin for the Corpse&quot;, but the Merlini character was replaced by Michael Shayne, a popular fictional private eye at the time, created by the writer Brett Halliday.

A 30-minute pilot for a television series was created in 1951, but no further episodes were made. &quot;The Transparent Man&quot;, written by Rawson, starred Jerome Thor as The Great Merlini — who in this incarnation was a stage magician — with Barbara Cook as his assistant Julie, and featuring E. G. Marshall as a criminal.

<doc id="465043" wikidata="Q704753" url="?curid=465043" title="Alex Cabrera">
<text>Alexander Alberto Cabrera (born December 24, 1971) is a Venezuelan former first baseman and right-handed batter who played in 2000 for the Arizona Diamondbacks in Major League Baseball (MLB) and for 12 seasons in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). He also played several seasons in the Mexican League and the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League (LVBP).

==Career==
Cabrera signed with the Chicago Cubs as an amateur free agent in 1991 and played in their minor league system through 1996. He moved to the Mexican League, playing for Potros de Minatitlán and Tigres Capitalinos in 1997 and returning to the Tigres in 1998. He attended spring training with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays before the 1998 season. He played for the Koos Group Whales in the CPBL in Taiwan in 1999, then signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2000.

After nine seasons in the minors, Cabrera finally reached the majors with the Diamondbacks. A muscular slugger, Cabrera hit a home run in his first at-bat. He ended the 2000 MLB season with a .262 average, five home runs, 14 RBI, 10 runs, and a .500 slugging percentage in 31 games. After the 2000 season, the Seibu Lions of the Japan Pacific League purchased his contract from Arizona.

In 2001, Cabrera batted .282, with 49 home runs and 124 RBI. He was even better in 2002, with a .336 batting average, 55 home runs, and 115 RBI, winning the Pacific League&#x27;s MVP award. His 55 home runs tied Japan&#x27;s single-season record, equaling the mark set by Sadaharu Oh in 1964 and matched by former MLB player Tuffy Rhodes in 2001. Cabrera stated that he was unable to break the record because pitchers threw him very few strikes after hitting his 55th home run. Wladimir Balentien later broke the home run record, hitting 60 home runs in 2013.

In 2003, Cabrera hit an impressive 50 home runs with 112 RBIs, while batting .324 for Seibu. Injuries limited him to 64 games in 2004, with 25 home runs and 62 RBIs.

On October 26, 2004, Cabrera hit a two-run towering homer as the Seibu Lions defeated the Chunichi Dragons 7–2 in Game 7 of the Japan Series to win their first championship since 1992. The ball bounced off the glass-enclosed private boxes above the left field seats at the Nagoya Dome. It was Cabrera&#x27;s third home run of the series. He also hit a grand slam and a two-run homer in Game 3.

In six seasons with the Lions, Cabrera was a .308 hitter with 246 home runs and 605 RBI in 708 games.

In January 2008, Cabrera signed a one-year contract with the Orix Buffaloes. The contract reportedly required that Cabrera pass a drug test when he reported to the team in February. He obtained free agency rights following the 2009 season after playing 8 years in Japan, thereby removing the designation as a &quot;foreign player,&quot; becoming the fourth non-Japanese player to obtain such classification in NPB.

In three seasons with Orix from 2008 through 2010, Cabrera slugged 73 home runs with 225 RBIs. Cabrera&#x27;s career in NPB ended with 97 games over two seasons for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in 2011 and 2012. 

After leaving Japan, Cabrera continued to play professional winter league baseball for Tiburones de La Guaira in his native Venezuela. In 59 games during the 2013–14 season, Cabrera batted .391, with a record-setting 21 home runs. He broke the league single season home run record set by Bo Díaz, who hit 20 home runs in 1979–80. Cabrera played 14 games for Rojos del Aguila de Veracruz in the Mexican League in April 2014 at the age of 42, batting .404 and hitting 4 home runs. He continued to play in the Venezuelan winter league until 2016–2017, playing 4 games in his final season with Tigres de Aragua.

==Steroid and performance-enhancing drug allegations==
On December 13, 2007, Cabrera was linked to steroid use in the Mitchell Report, one of many MLB players so identified. The report detailed an incident in September 2000 when Cabrera on the Arizona Diamondbacks. Team officials found a package that contained a vial of what they suspected to be anabolic steroids and several hundred pills. Clubhouse attendants claimed the package was intended for Cabrera. The contents of the package were tested, and it was determined that the vial contained the anabolic steroid Winstrol, but the pills were legal, over-the-counter diet pills. Before the tests came back, however, Cabrera&#x27;s contract had been sold to the Seibu Lions, so he was never tested for steroid use. Cabrera denied knowing why the package had been addressed to him.

After the report came out, Cabrera denied ever using steroids.&quot;I couldn&#x27;t have used the substances that are identified. I never had possession of the alleged box that supposedly contained the pharmaceutical drugs.&quot;

During his career in Japan, Cabrera never tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. In 2013, he stated that he never injected himself with or smoked drugs.

In 2014, Cabrera tested positive for stanozolol, which ended his career in the Mexican League. A Mexican sports court later suspended his permanent ban from the league.

In 2016, Cabrera tested positive for adderall while playing in the LVBP. His suspension was overturned by a Venezuelan court later in 2016. He tested positive for stanozolol in December 2016, receiving a 50-game suspension from the LVBP.

Cabrera&#x27;s son Ramón is also a professional baseball player. The younger Cabrera, a switch-hitting catcher, signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates organization in 2008, at the age of 18. Ramón made his major league debut with the Cincinnati Reds on September 5, 2015. Cabrera played against his son in some winter league games.

<text>Oreopithecus (from the Greek , and , , meaning &quot;hill-ape&quot;) is an extinct genus of ape from the Miocene epoch whose fossils have been found in today&#x27;s Tuscany and Sardinia in Italy. It existed 9–7 million years ago in the Tusco-Sardinian area when this region was an isolated island in a chain of islands stretching from central Europe to northern Africa in what was becoming the Mediterranean Sea.

&quot;Oreopithecus&quot; was one of many European immigrants that settled this area in the Vallesian–Turolian transition and one of few hominoids, together with &quot;Sivapithecus&quot; in Asia, to survive the so-called Vallesian Crisis. To date, dozens of individuals have been discovered at the Tuscan localities of Montebamboli, Montemassi, Casteani, Ribolla, and, most notably, in the fossil-rich lignite mine in the Baccinello Basin, making it one of the best-represented fossil apes.

==Evolutionary history==
&quot;Oreopithecus bambolii&quot; was first described by French paleontologist Paul Gervais in 1872, after the discovery of a juvenile mandible in a lignite mine at Montebamboli in 1862 by Tito Nardi, who donate the specimen to Professor Igino Cocchi. In 1890, nearly a dozen new specimens were reported by Guiseppe Ristori, among them an upper jaw. In 1898, a left lower jaw was described by Felice Ottolenghi. In 1907, Giuseppe Merciai reported four maxillae and a lower jaw from the Grosseto mine at Ribolla. During this period there was no consensus whether &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; was a monkey or an ape.

From 1949 onwards, Swiss paleontologist Johannes Hürzeler began to restudy the known material. In 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1958, he claimed &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; were a true hominin—based on its premolars, short jaws and reduced canines, at the time considered diagnostic of the hominin family. This hypothesis immediately became a hotly discussed topic among his fellow paleontolgists. When he toured the world to give a series of lectures, his views generated an enormous press coverage, often being presented as a challenge to the Darwinian descent of man from apes. After Hürzeler was invited to give a lecture in New York in March 1956, the Wenner-Gren Foundation decided to finance excavations in Italy, with the cooperation of the Italian paleontologist Alberto Carlo Blanc. On 2 August 1958, Hürzeler&#x27;s views seemed to be confirmed when he discovered a complete skeleton in Baccinello, which in 1960 he interpreted as a biped because of the short pelvis was closer to those of hominins than those of chimpanzees and gorillas. Hominin affinities claimed for &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; remained controversial for decades until new analyses in the 1990s reasserted that &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; was directly related to &quot;Dryopithecus&quot;. The peculiar cranial and dental features were explained as consequences of insular isolation.

This new evidence confirmed that &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; was bipedal but also revealed that its peculiar form of bipedalism was much different from that of &quot;Australopithecus&quot;. The hallux formed a 100° angle with the other toes, which enabled the foot to act as a tripod in erect posture, but prevented &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; from developing a fast bipedal stride. When a land bridge broke the isolation of the Tusco-Sardinian area , large predators such as &quot;Machairodus&quot; and &quot;Metailurus&quot; were present among the new generation of European immigrants and &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; faced quick extinction together with other endemic genera.

===Taxonomic classification===
Known as the &quot;enigmatic hominoid&quot;, &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; can dramatically rewrite the palaeontological map depending on whether it is a descendant of the European ape &quot;Dryopithecus&quot; or an African anthropoid. Some have suggested the unique locomotory behavior of &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; requires a revision of the current consensus on the timing of bipedality in human developmental history, but there is limited agreement on this point among paleontologists.

Simons (1960) considered &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; closely related to the early Oligocene &quot;Apidium&quot;, a small arboreal anthropoid that lived nearly 34 million years ago in Egypt. &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; shows strong links to modern apes in its postcranium and, in this respect, it is the most modern Miocene ape below the neck, with closest similarities to the postcranial elements of &quot;Dryopithecus&quot;, but its dentition is adapted to a leafy diet and a close link is uncertain. Others claim it to be either the sister taxon to Cercopithecoidea or an even direct human ancestor, but it is usually placed in its own subfamily within Hominidae. It could instead be added to the same subfamily as &quot;Dryopithecus&quot;, perhaps as a distinct tribe (Oreopithecini). A cladistic analysis of &quot;Nyanzapithecus alesi&quot; recovers &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; as a member of the proconsulid subfamily Nyanzapithecinae. A 2023 phylogenetic analysis suggested found a close relationship with gibbons, though the author suggested that this was likely due to having a similar climbing lifestyle and retained plesiomorphies, rather than a real close relationship, but suggested that it was unlikely that &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; was a member of Hominidae.

==Physical characteristics==
&quot;Oreopithecus bambolii&quot; is estimated to have weighed . It possessed a relatively short snout, elevated nasal bones, small and globular neurocranium, vertical orbital plane, and gracile facial bones. The shearing crests on its molars suggest a diet specializing in plant leaves. The very robust lower face, with a large attachment surface for the masseter muscle and a sagittal crest for attachment of the temporal muscle, indicates a heavy masticatory apparatus.

Its teeth were small relative to body size. The lack of a diastema (gap) between the second incisor and first premolar of the mandible indicates that &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; had canines of size comparable to the rest of its dentition. In many primates, small canines correlate with reduced inter-male competition for access to mates and less sexual dimorphism.

===Positional behavior===
Its habitat appears to have been swampy, and not savanna or forest. The postcranial anatomy of &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; features adaptations for suspensory arborealism. Functional traits related to suspensory locomotion include its broad thorax, short trunk, high intermembral index, long and slender digits, and extensive mobility in virtually all joints. Its fingers and arms seem to show adaptations for climbing and swinging.

Its foot has been described as chimp-like, but is different from those of extant primates. The habitual line of leverage of the primate foot is parallel to the third metatarsal bone. In &quot;Oreopithecus&quot;, the lateral metatarsals are permanently abducted so that this line falls between the first and second metatarsals instead. Furthermore, the shape of the tarsus indicate loads on the foot were transmitted to the medial side of the foot instead of the lateral, like in other primates. The metatarsals are short and straight, but have a lateral orientation increase. Its foot proportions are close to the unusual proportions of &quot;Gorilla&quot; and &quot;Homo&quot; but are distinct from those found in specialized climbers. The lack of predators and the limitation of space and resources in &quot;Oreopithecus&quot;″ insular environment favored a locomotor system optimized for low energy expenditure rather than speed and mobility.

&quot;Oreopithecus&quot; has been claimed to exhibit features that are adaptations to upright walking, such as the presence of a lumbar curve, in distinction to otherwise similar species known from the same period. Since the fossils have been dated to about 8 million years ago, this would represent an unusually early appearance of upright posture. However, a reevaluation of the spine from a skeleton of &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; has led to the conclusion that it lacked adaptations for habitual bipedality.

====Semicircular canals====
The semicircular canals of the inner ear serves as a sense organ for balance and controls the reflex for gaze stabilization. The inner ear has three canals on each side of the head, and each of the six canals encloses a membranous duct that forms an endolymph-filled circuit. Hair cells in the duct&#x27;s auditory ampulla pick up endolymph disturbances caused by movement, which register as rotatory head movement. They respond to body sway of frequencies greater than 0.1 Hz and trigger the vestibulocollic (neck) reflex and vestibuloocular (eye) reflex to recover balance and gaze stability. The bony semicircular canals allow estimates of duct arc length and orientation with respect to the sagittal plane.

Across species, the semicircular canals of agile animals have larger arcs than those of slower ones. For example, the rapid leaper &quot;Tarsius bancanus&quot; has semicircular canals much bigger than the slow-climbing &quot;Nycticebus coucang&quot;. The semicircular canals of brachiating gibbons are bigger than those of arboreal and terrestrial quadrupedal great apes. As a rule of thumb, arc size of the ducts &quot;decreases&quot; with body mass and consequently slower angular head motions. Arc size &quot;increases&quot; with greater agility and thus more rapid head motions. Modern humans have bigger arcs on their anterior and posterior canals, which reflect greater angular motion along the sagittal plane. The lateral canal has a smaller arc size, corresponding to reduced head movement from side to side.
Allometric measurements on the bony labyrinth of BAC-208, a fragmentary cranium that preserves a complete, undeformed petrosal bone suggest that &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; moved with agility comparable to extant great apes. Its anterior and lateral semicircular canal sizes fall within the range for great apes.

Its relatively large posterior arc implies that &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; was more proficient at stabilizing angular head motion along the sagittal plane.

===Dexterity===
&quot;Oreopithecus&quot; had hominin-like hand proportions that allowed a firm, pad-to-pad precision grip. Features present in the hands of neither non-human-extant nor fossil apes include hand length, relative thumb length, a deep and large insertion for the flexor pollicis longus, and the shape of the carpometacarpal joint between the metacarpal bone of the index finger and the capitate bone.

At the base of the second metacarpal bone, the facet for the capitate is oriented transversally, as in hominins. The capitate, on the other hand, lacks the waisting associated with apes and climbing, and still present in &quot;Australopithecus&quot;. &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; share the specialised orientation at the carpometacarpal joint with &quot;A. afarenis&quot; and the marked groove for the flexor pollicis longus with &quot;A. africanus&quot;. It is thus likely that the hand morphology of &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; is derived for apes and convergent for early hominins.

<text>In United States law, a motion is a procedural device to bring a limited, contested issue before a court for decision. It is a request to the judge (or judges) to make a decision about the case. Motions may be made at any point in administrative, criminal or civil proceedings, although that right is regulated by court rules which vary from place to place. The party requesting the motion is the &quot;moving party&quot; or &quot;movant&quot;. The party opposing the motion is the &quot;nonmoving party&quot; or &quot;nonmovant&quot;.

==Process==

In the United States, as a general rule, courts do not have self-executing powers. In other words, in order for the court to rule on a contested issue in a case before it, one of the parties or a third party must raise an appropriate motion asking for a particular order. Some motions may be made in the form of an oral request in open court, which is then either summarily granted or denied orally by the court. This is still common with motions made during trial. 

Today, however, most motions (especially on important or dispositive issues that could decide the entire case) are decided after oral argument preceded by the filing and service of legal papers. That is, the movant is usually required to serve advance written notice along with a written legal argument and a supporting factual foundation to explain why the movant is entitled to the relief requested. The legal argument usually comes in the form of a memorandum of points and authorities, while the evidence of the facts supporting the legal argument is normally supplied in the form of affidavits or declarations under penalty of perjury (which may in turn authenticate attached documentary exhibits). 

A few U.S. states have a tradition in which the legal argument comes in the form of an affidavit from the attorney, speaking personally as himself on behalf of their client. In contrast, in most U.S. states, the memorandum is written impersonally, or as if the client were speaking directly to the court, and the attorney reserves declarations of their own personal knowledge to a separate affidavit or declaration (which are then cited to in the memorandum). One U.S. state, Missouri, uses the unique term &quot;suggestions&quot; for the memorandum of points and authorities.

Either way, the nonmovant usually has the opportunity to file and serve papers opposing the motion. In addition, most jurisdictions allow for time for the movant to file reply papers rebutting the arguments made in the opposition.

Customs vary widely as to whether oral argument is optional or mandatory once briefing in writing is complete. Some courts issue tentative rulings before the hearing (after which the losing party may demand oral argument) while others do not. Depending upon the type of motion and the jurisdiction, the court may simply issue an oral decision from the bench (possibly accompanied by a request to the winner to draft an order for the judicial officer&#x27;s signature reducing the salient points to writing), take the matter under submission and draft a lengthy written decision and order, direct the clerk to record the decision in summary form in the minutes of the court (that is, a &quot;minute order&quot; which might record only the disposition of the motion and not the court&#x27;s reasons), or simply fill out a standard court form with check boxes for different outcomes. The court may serve all parties directly with its decision or may serve only the winner and order the winner to serve everyone else in the case.

==Types==
===U.S. federal courts===
====To dismiss====
A &quot;motion to dismiss&quot; asks the court to decide that a claim, even if true as stated, is not one for which the law offers a legal remedy. As an example, a claim that the defendant failed to greet the plaintiff while passing the latter on the street, insofar as no legal duty to do so may exist, would be dismissed for failure to state a valid claim: the court must assume the truth of the factual allegations, but may hold that the claim states no cause of action under the applicable substantive law. A claim that has been presented after the statute of limitations has expired is also subject to dismissal. If granted, the claim is dismissed without any evidence being presented by the other side. A motion to dismiss has taken the place of the common law demurrer in most modern civil practice. When a court dismisses a case, many laypeople state the case was &quot;thrown out.&quot;

Under Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a party may raise by motion any defense, objection, or request that the court can determine without a trial of the general issue. Before the trial starts, the motions can be based on defects in instituting the prosecution, defects in the indictment or information (which can be challenged at any stage but are generally raised before a trial begins). Pleadings in a federal criminal proceeding are the indictment, the information, and the pleas of not guilty, guilty, and &quot;nolo contendere&quot;. A motion under Rule 14 can address the statement of the charges (or individual specifications, see below) or the defendants. In these instances, the motion to dismiss is characterized as a &quot;motion to sever charges or defendants.&quot;

Under Rule 907, (Rules for Courts-Martial), a motion to dismiss is a request to terminate further proceedings on one or more criminal charges and specifications on grounds capable of resolution without trial of the general issue of guilt. A motion may be based on nonwaivable grounds (e.g. lack of jurisdiction or the failure to state an offense) or waivable grounds (denial of a right to a speedy trial, statute of limitation, double jeopardy meaning a person has been previously tried by court-martial or federal civilian court for the same offense, pardon or grant of immunity). Specifications are sometimes referred to as &#x27;counts&#x27; or separate instances of a particular offense which are connected to specific factual evidence. A motion may seek to dismiss these specifications, especially if it is so defective it substantially misled the accused, or it is multiplicious.

Multiplicity, also known as &quot;allied offenses of similar import&quot;, is the situation where two or more allegations allege the same offense, or a situation where one defined offense necessarily includes another. Accounts may also be multiplicious if two or more describe substantially the same misconduct in different ways. For example, assault and disorderly conduct may be multiplicious if facts and evidence presented at trial prove that the disorderly conduct consists solely of the assault. That is to say, if all the elements contained in one are all in another they are allied offenses of similar import.

Discovery motions relate to the necessary exchange of information between the parties. In the common law system, these motions capture an irreducible tension in the legal system between the right of discovery and a duty to disclose information to another.

There are numerous practical differences between the discovery expectations and practices in civil and criminal proceedings. The local rules of many courts clarify expectations with respect to civil discovery, in part because these are often poorly understood or are abused as part of a trial strategy. As a result, civil discovery rules pertain to discretionary discovery practices and much of the argument in this respect centers on the proper definition of the scope of the parties requests. Because criminal prosecutions generally implicate a well-defined constitutional guarantee, criminal discovery is much more focused on automatic disclosure principles, which if found to be violated, will trigger the dismissal of the charges.

Rules 7.1 and 26-37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, are often cited in combination with a specific local rule to form a basis for a civil discovery motion.

Rule 16, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, is the basis for a criminal discovery motion. Rule 906(b)(7), Rules for Courts-Martial a variety of a &quot;motion for appropriate relief&quot; is used as a military law basis for discovery.

====For summary judgment====
A &quot;motion for summary judgment&quot; asks the court to decide that the available evidence, even if taken in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, supports a ruling in favor of the moving party. This motion is usually only made when sufficient time for discovering all evidence has expired. For summary judgment to be granted in most jurisdictions, a two-part standard must be satisfied: (i) no genuine issue of material fact can be in dispute between the parties, and (ii) the moving party must be entitled to judgment as a matter of law. For example, a claim that a doctor engaged in malpractice by prescribing a drug could result in summary judgment if the plaintiff failed to obtain expert testimony indicating that the drug was improperly prescribed. Motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment are types of dispositive motions.

Rule 56, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is the rule which explains the mechanics of a summary judgment motion. As explained in the notes to this rule, summary judgment procedure is a method for promptly disposing of actions in which there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Prior to its introduction in the US in 1934, it was used in England for more than 50 years.

In England motions for summary judgments were used only in cases of liquidated claims, there followed a steady enlargement of the scope of the remedy until it was used in actions to recover land or chattels and in all other actions at law, for liquidated or unliquidated claims, except for a few designated torts and breach of promise of marriage. English Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 3, r. 6; Orders 14, 14A, and 15; see also O. 32, r. 6, authorizing an application for judgment at any time upon admissions. New York was a leader in the adoption of this rule in the US and the success of the method helps account for its current importance as an almost indispensable tool in administrative actions (especially before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which adjudicates employment discrimination claims and the Merit Systems Protection Board which adjudicates federal employment matters).

The &quot;Civil Litigation Management Manual&quot; published by the US Judicial Conference directs that these motions be filed at the optimum time and warns that premature motions can be a waste of time and effort. The significant resources needed to prepare and defend against such motions is a major factor which influences litigants to use them extensively. In many cases, particularly from the defendant&#x27;s (or defense) perspective, accurate or realistic estimates of the costs and risks of an actual trial are made only after a motion has been denied. Overbroad motions for summary judgment are sometimes designed to make the opponent rehearse their case before trial.

Most summary judgment motions must be filed in accordance with specific rules relating to the content and quality of the information presented to the judge. Among other things, most motions for summary judgment will require or include: page limits on submissions by counsel; an instruction to state disputed issues of fact up front; an instruction to state whether there is a governing case; an instruction that all summary judgment motions be accompanied by electronic versions (on a CD-R or DVD-R), in a chambers-compatible format that includes full pinpoint citations and complete deposition and affidavit excerpts to aid in opinion preparation; an instruction that all exhibits submitted conform to specific physical characteristics (i.e. be tabbed with letters or numbers, that pages be sequentially numbered or &quot;Bates-stamped&quot;); an instruction that citations to deposition or affidavit testimony must include the appropriate page or paragraph numbers and that citations to other documents or materials must include pinpoint citations. Many judges also ask the parties to prepare form orders with a brief statements of law to help the judge write the decision. A judge generally issues a tentative ruling on the submitted pleadings, and counsel will be offered an opportunity to respond in a later oral argument. Alternatively, a judge may grant requests for argument in a preargument order which specifies what points will be discussed prior to a decision.

====&quot;In limine&quot;====
A &quot;motion &quot;in limine&quot;&quot; asks the court to decide that certain evidence may or may not be presented to the jury at the trial. A motion in limine generally addresses issues which would be prejudicial for the jury to hear in open court, even if the other side makes a timely objection which is sustained, and the judge instructs the jury to disregard the evidence. For example, the defendant may ask the court to rule that evidence of a prior conviction that occurred a long time ago should not be allowed into evidence at the trial because it would be more prejudicial than probative. If the motion is granted, then evidence regarding the conviction could not be mentioned in front of the jury, without first approaching the judge outside of the hearing of the jury and obtaining permission. The violation of a motion in limine can result in the court declaring a mistrial.

There are three types of motions &quot;in limine&quot;:
* Inclusionary - A motion asking the court to have something included in the trial.
* Exclusionary - A motion asking the court to have something excluded in the trial.
* Preclusionary - A motion asking the court to have something precluded in the trial

====For a directed verdict====
A &quot;motion for a directed verdict&quot; asks the court to rule that the plaintiff or prosecutor has not proven the case, and there is no need for the defense to attempt to present evidence. This motion is made after the plaintiff has rested its case, and prior to the defense presenting any evidence. If granted, the court would dismiss the case.

====For judgment &quot;n.o.v.&quot;====
A &quot;motion for judgment &quot;n.o.v.&quot;&quot; (&quot;non obstante veredicto&quot;, or notwithstanding the verdict) asks the court to reverse the jury&#x27;s verdict on the grounds that the jury could not reasonably have reached such a verdict. This motion is made after the jury&#x27;s verdict. If granted, the court enters a new verdict. This motion can be used in a criminal case only to reverse a guilty verdict; not guilty verdicts are immune to reversal by the court.

Under Rule 50, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the motion for directed verdict and JNOV have been replaced by the motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL), which can be made at the close of the opposing party&#x27;s evidence and &quot;renewed&quot; after return of the verdict (or after the dismissal of a hung jury).

Under Rule 29, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure the &quot;motion for a judgment of acquittal,&quot; or Rule 917, Rules for Courts-Martial the &quot;motion for a finding of not guilty,&quot; if the evidence presented by the prosecution is insufficient to support a rational finding of guilty, there is no reason to submit the issue to a jury.

====For new trial====
A motion for new trial asks to overturn or set aside a court&#x27;s decision or jury verdict. Such a motion is proposed by a party who is dissatisfied with the end result of a case. This motion must be based on some vital error in the court&#x27;s handling of the trial, such as the admission or exclusion of key evidence, or an incorrect instruction to the jury. Generally the motion is filed within a short time after the trial (7–30 days) and is decided prior to the lodging of an appeal. In some jurisdictions, a motion for new trial which is not ruled upon by a set period of time automatically is deemed to be denied.

====To set aside judgment====
A &quot;motion to set aside judgment&quot; asks the court to vacate or nullify a judgment or verdict. Motions may be made at any time after entry of judgment, and in some circumstances years after the case has been closed by the courts. Generally the grounds for the motion cannot be ones which were previously considered when deciding a motion for new trial or on an appeal of the judgment.

====For &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;====
A &quot;motion for &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;&quot; (&quot;not prosecuting&quot;) is a motion by a prosecutor or other plaintiff to drop legal charges. n. Latin for &quot;we do not wish to prosecute,&quot; which is a declaration made to the judge by a prosecutor in a criminal case (or by a plaintiff in a civil lawsuit) either before or during trial, meaning the case against the defendant is being dropped. The statement is an admission that the charges cannot be proved, that evidence has demonstrated either innocence or a fatal flaw in the prosecution&#x27;s claim, or the district attorney has become convinced the accused is innocent. It should be distinguished from the motion for judgment of &quot;non prosequitur&quot;, or judgment of &quot;non pros&quot;, which is a motion in some jurisdictions (e.g. Pennsylvania) by a defendant for a judgment in his favor for failure of the plaintiff to timely prosecute his claim.

====To compel====
A &quot;motion to compel&quot; asks the court to order either the opposing party or a third party to take some action. This sort of motion most commonly deals with discovery disputes, when a party who has propounded discovery to either the opposing party or a third party believes that the discovery responses are insufficient. The motion to compel is used to ask the court to order the non-complying party to produce the documentation or information requested or to sanction the non-complying party for their failure to comply with the discovery requests.

<text>Death from a Top Hat (1938) is a locked-room mystery novel written by Clayton Rawson. It is the first of four mysteries featuring The Great Merlini, a stage magician and Rawson&#x27;s favorite protagonist.

In a poll of 17 detective story writers and reviewers, this novel was voted as the seventh best locked room mystery of all time.

==Plot summary==

&quot;As the story opens, free-lance writer Ross Harte is writing a magazine article on the modern detective story, and most of this article-to-be is included in the first chapter.&quot;

When a magician is found dead inside his locked and (thoroughly) sealed apartment, the police call in Merlini to help explain the impossible, &quot;perhaps on the theory that it takes a magician to catch one.&quot;
All the suspects, however, are accustomed to producing the impossible. They include a professional medium, an escape artist, a couple of magicians, a ventriloquist, and two people who claim to exhibit mental telepathy in their nightclub act.

The first murder victim is found spread-eagled inside a pentagram, surrounded by the trappings of black magic. The second victim, also spread-eagled, seems to have been in two places at once during the first murder. After a number of breakneck chases from one scene to the next, Merlini and his assistant are a couple of steps ahead of the police and provide a far-fetched but logical solution to the impossible crimes.

In between, Merlini and other characters deliver great chunks of informative conversation mixed with paragraphs of information about entirely unrelated but fascinating topics, like yogic bilocation, making the keys of a typewriter move without touching them, and even posing a tricky problem in geometry. The action also stops for a while when Merlini quotes a well-known passage from John Dickson Carr&#x27;s &quot;The Three Coffins&quot; about the nature of locked-room mystery novels, and adds some flourishes of his own in relation to the problems at hand.

The penultimate scene in which the murderer is revealed is enlivened by one of the suspects attempting (on stage) to catch a bullet in his teeth, and all is explained in the final chapter when everyone gathers at Merlini&#x27;s Magic Shop in the best whodunnit tradition.

==Film adaptation==
The book was adapted for the film &quot;Miracles for Sale&quot; (1939) starring Robert Young and directed by Tod Browning, whose last film it was. The film simplifies the complex plot and replaces the character of Merlini with &quot;The Great Morgan&quot; (Mike), played by Young.

<text>Pachuca (; ), formally known as Pachuca de Soto, is the capital and largest city of the east-central Mexican state of Hidalgo, located in the south-central part of the state. Pachuca de Soto is also the name of the municipality for which the city serves as municipal seat. Pachuca is located about north of Mexico City via Mexican Federal Highway 85. 

There is no agreed upon consensus regarding the origins of the word &quot;pachuca&quot;. It has been loosely traced to &quot;pachoa&quot; (&#x27;strait&#x27;, &#x27;opening&#x27;), &quot;pachoacan&quot; (&#x27;place of government&#x27;, &#x27;place of silver and gold&#x27;) and &quot;patlachuican&quot; (&#x27;place of factories&#x27;, &#x27;place of tears&#x27;).

The official name of Pachuca is &quot;Pachuca de Soto&quot; in honor of congressman Manuel Fernando Soto, who is credited with the founding of Hidalgo state. Its nickname of La Bella Airosa (&quot;the airy, beautiful&quot;) comes from the strong winds that blow through the canyons to the north of the city. In the indigenous Otomi language, Pachuca is known as . The area had been long-inhabited; apart from some green obsidian, the mining that Pachuca is most famous for began in the mid-16th century, during Spanish colonial rule.

Pachuca remained a major mining center until the mid-20th century, with the city&#x27;s fortunes fluctuating with the health of the mining sector. In the mid-20th century, a major downturn in mining pushed the city to shift focus from mining to industry, resulting in the revamping of the Universidad Autónoma de Hidalgo. Today, mining forms only a fraction of the municipality&#x27;s economy. One cultural aspect that makes Pachuca unique is the influence of the Cornish miners who immigrated in the 19th century from Great Britain, as many of their descendants remain in Pachuca, and nearby Real del Monte. Furthermore, the Cornish populace helped to shape two local traditions that define the city—fútbol and a dish called &quot;pastes.&quot;

==History==

Evidence of early human habitation in this area is found in Cerro de las Navajas and Zacualtipán, in the Sierra de Pachuca. Here primitive mines to extract green obsidian, arrow heads, scraping tools, and mammoth remains can be traced back as far as 12,000 BCE. An ancient pre-Hispanic obsidian tool-making center has also been found in the small town of San Bartolo near the city. Around 2,000 BCE nomadic groups here began to be replaced by sedentary peoples who formed farming villages in an area then known as Itzcuincuitlapilco, of which the municipality of Pachuca is a part. Later artifacts from between 200 CE and 850 CE show Teotihuacan influence with platforms and figurines found in San Bartolo and in Tlapacoya. Development of this area as a city, however, would lag behind other places in the region such as Tulancingo, Tula and Atotonilco El Grande, but the archeological sites here were on the trade routes among these larger cities.

After the Teotihuacan era, the area was dominated by the Chichimecas with their capital in Xaltocan, who called the area around Pachuca Njunthé. Later, the Chichimecas would found the dominion of Cuauhtitlán pushing the native Otomis to the Mezquital Valley. These conquests coalesced into a zone called Cuautlalpan, of which Pachuca was a part. Fortifications in the area of Pachuca city and other areas were built between 1174 and 1181.
This dominion would eventually be overrun by the Aztec Triple Alliance between 1427 and 1430, with rule in Pachuca then coming from the city of Tenochtitlan. According to tradition, it was after this conquest that mineral exploitation began here and in neighboring Real del Monte, at a site known as Jacal or San Nicolás. The Aztec governing center was where Plaza Juárez in Pachuca city is now.

The Spanish arrived here in 1528, killing the local Aztec governor, Ixcóatl. Credit for the Spanish conquest of the Pachuca area has been given Francisco Téllez, an artilleryman who came to Mexico with Hernán Cortés in 1519. He and Gonzalo Rodriguez were the first Spaniards here, constructing two feudal estates, and calling the area Real de Minas de Pachuca. Téllez was also given credit for laying out the colonial city of Pachuca on the European model but this story has been proven false, with no alternative version. Mining resources were not discovered here until 1552, and there are several versions of this story. The most probable comes from a work called &quot;Descripción Anónima de la Minas de Pachuca&quot; (Anonymous Description of the Mines of Pachuca) written between the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th. This work claims that the first mineral deposits were found by Alonso Rodríguez de Salgado on his ranch on the outskirts of Pachuca in two large hills called Magdalena and Cristóbal. This discovery would quickly change the area&#x27;s economy from agriculture to one dependent almost completely on mining.

As early as 1560 the population of the city had tripled to 2,200, with most people employed in mining in some way. Because of this rapid growth and the ruggedness of the terrain, it was impossible to lay out an orderly set of streets. The first main plaza was placed next to the Asunción Parish, which is now the Garden of the Constitution. Next to the (Royal Safe) was constructed to guard the fifth that belonged to the king.

In 1554, on the , now the site of a tennis club, Bartolomé de Medina found the largest mineral deposits here as well as developed new ways of extracting minerals from ore using the patio process. This caused Pachuca to grow even more with the discovery of new deposits and accelerated extraction processes. Mining operations spread to nearby areas such as Atotonilco, Actopan, and Tizayuca. The population of the town continued to grow, leading Pachuca to be declared a city in 1813.

Mining output had waned by the 18th century due to flooding, but was revived in 1741 by the first Count of Regla, Pedro Romero de Terreros, and his business partner Jose Alejandro Bustamante, who invested in new drainage works. He also discovered new veins of ore, mostly in nearby Real del Monte. By 1746, Pachuca had a population of 900 Spanish, mestizo, and mulatto households, plus 120 Indian ones.

During the Mexican War of Independence, the city was taken by Miguel Serrano and Vicente Beristain de Souza in 1812, which caused the mines here to be abandoned by owners loyal to Spain. The war left the Pachuca area in a state of chaos, both politically and economically. The third Count of Regla brought the first Cornish miners and technology around 1824. The Cornish took over mines abandoned by the Spanish, bringing 1,500 tonnes of more modern equipment from Cornwall. Cornish companies eventually dominated mining here until 1848, when the Mexican–American War forced them to sell out to a Mexican company by the name of Mackintosh, Escondón, Beistegui and John Rule. Mining operations resumed in 1850, especially in the Rosario mine.

Mining operations were disrupted again by the Mexican Revolution in the early 20th century. The city was first taken by forces loyal to Francisco I. Madero in 1911. Roberto Martinez y Martinez, a general under Pancho Villa, entered the city in 1915. Both incursions were due to the economic importance of the mines here. During this time American investors came to Pachuca, again updating the mining technology used here. From 1906 to 1947 the United States Smelting, Refining and Mining Company was the primary producer here, with output reaching its peak in the 1930s. However, by 1947, mining here had become too costly, because of political instability, labor disputes and low prices for silver on the world market. The company sold its interests to the Mexican government in 1965.

The decline in mining here in the mid-20th century had disastrous effects on the city. Many of the abandoned houses and other buildings were in danger of collapse. Under ownership of the Mexican government, mining came to a near standstill. During this time Pachuca&#x27;s economy began to shift from mining to industry. The old Instituto Científico Literario Autónomo de Hidalgo was converted to the Universidad Autónoma del Estado in 1961, which would become one of the impetuses to the growth of the city in the following years, turning out as it did a better-educated and more technical workforce in areas such as law, engineering, business and medicine. In the late 1950s and through the 1960s, some growth was seen in the way of suburban developments for workers in newly built factories.

Population growth returned in the 1970s and continued through the 1990s because of the growth of non-mining industries as well as a development of a large student population for the state university as well as other educational institutions. Another impetus was the movement of many government offices to Pachuca with new government facilities such as the State Government Palace and the State Supreme Court built in the 1970s. Much of the city&#x27;s growth during this time was due to new housing projects, but infrastructure projects such as the new Municipal Market, the remodeling of the Plaza Benito Juárez and the main bus station also took place.

==The city==
The city occupies a small valley and is almost completely surrounded by large hills, which are also covered in colorful housing. The city centre has maintained most of its colonial-era structures, with narrow winding streets. Away from this centre is the more modern Pachuca, with warehouses, factories, supermarkets and a large football stadium called (The Hurricane). The local team has won eight national and international titles here since it was built. The city proper has a population (2005) of 267,751 which is 97% of the population of the municipality. The Pachuca zona metropolitana (ZM) is one of the 56 officially defined areas for the 2005 Census (2010 not released) consisting of the municipalities of Pachuca de Soto, Real del Monte, and Mineral de la Reforma making a total of 7 &quot;municipios&quot;, with a combined population of 438,692 inhabitants , up from 375,022 in 2000, covering 1202 km2. Pachuca was declared the capital of Hidalgo by Benito Juárez in 1869.

===City attractions===

Pachuca is center of one of the most important mining areas in Mexico, and for this reason, most of the city&#x27;s attractions are based on the mining industry. Many of these are located near Hidalgo Street, which is one of the oldest in Pachuca and runs alongside the arcade of the main plaza (Plaza de la Constitución) to Hidalgo Park. The oldest markets and houses are also located on this street, many of which are well-preserved.

;Reloj Monumental
The Monumental Clock of Pachuca is the icon of the city. Donated by Cornishman, Francis Rule, it was built to commemorate the Centennial of Mexico&#x27;s Independence, and was inaugurated on 15 September 1910 (Noche de Grito). The base of the Reloj was made originally for a kiosk but it was decided to put the clock here instead. A group from the city had the idea for the clock, and they, along with Mexican ambassador Jesús Zenil arranged to have the same company that built Big Ben, construct the inner workings. The outer monument portion is Mexican-made and was supervised by engineers Francisco Hernández and Luis Carreón. It is a tower with four parts in Neoclassic style, constructed of white &quot;cantera&quot; stone with a height of 40 meters. In the middle there are four sculpted faces of women done in marble by Carrara, which symbolise the Reform, Liberty, Independence and Constitution.

;Church and ex monastery of San Francisco
The Church and ex monastery of San Francisco were begun in 1596, and the church was completed c. 1660. The façade is in the colonial Spanish Baroque style. The interior conserves aspects of its 16th-century origins, including the groin vault. The church contains oil paintings by regionally well-known artists of the 18th century. The sacristy has a beautiful ritual sinks in sculpted stone, one of which is decorated with Talavera tile from Puebla. It also has paintings depicting the genealogy and life of Francis of Assisi.

The adjoining cloister was completed in 1604. It has not been a monastery for many years, and had a number of subsequent uses. It had greatly deteriorated, until recently restored to house the Centro Cultural Hidalgo. Behind the church is the Chapel of Nuestra Señora de la Luz. Built between the 17th and 18th century, it contains the only Churrigueresque altar in the city. This altar also contains the remains of the Count of Regla, Pedro Romero de Terreros.

The Museum of Photography and Photographic Library of INAH, and the Regional Museum, occupy much of the complex now. The photography museum contains antique photography equipment as well as works by known photographers such as Guillermo Kahlo and Tina Modotti. To the east of the monastery complex is the Bartolomé de Medina Park. The City Theater and the School of Arts face the park.

;Asunción Church
The Asunción Church is the oldest in the city, constructed in 1553, and remodeled several times, with major reconstruction in 1719. The Asunción Chapel has an entrance with two levels. The lower one contains the door and has a round arch, flanked by two pilasters and a Baroque architrave. The upper level has a choir window, with a niche above and topped by a pediment. The bell tower also has two levels, both with round arches.
;Mercantil Bank—Bancomer Building
The Bancomer Building is located at the front of the main plaza. It was designed in the Neoclassical style, and built in 1902. It was first occupied by the Mercantil Bank, then by the Hidalgo Bank and then was converted into the Niágara Hotel. Today it has returned to being a bank. It has a notable façade of brown cantera stone, lightly sculpted, with a keystone in the form of a parchment, cornice, Ionic columns and geometric designed in the upper parts. It is topped by a pediment which contains the figure of a lion.

;Cajas Reales
The Cajas Reales was where miners paid a 20% share of their extractions to the Spanish Crown. It not only collected the taxes, it was the only place that sold the mercury needed to extract silver from ore as a monopoly of the state. It was constructed in the 17th century by viceroy Sebastián de Toledo Márquez Mancera. It is a two-story building with a central patio. The façade contains two towers that flank the main entrance and the north side to serve as guard stations for the building. It has housed the offices of the Compañía Real del Monte y Pachuca since 1850. Emperor Maximillian I stayed here when he visited the city in 1865.
;Methodist Church
The Methodist Church building was built in the early 20th century, and is distinguished by its locally rare Romanesque Revival style. It is considered an important building of the Cornish period in the state.

It remains a Protestant church and contains the Julián Villagrán School.

;Casa Colorado
The Casa Colorado, part of the hacienda of the Conde de Regla, was built in the 18th century. It has an austere façade of a reddish colour, which gives the house its name. The building formerly had an interior courtyard with a Gothic style cloister arcade, but was demolished when enclosed.

In 1886 Governor Francisco Cravioto acquired this building to house state judicial offices. The building served the judiciary through the mid-20th century. Many of the streets connecting from here to nearby Hidalgo Street are named after former notable lawyers and judges.

;Archivo Historico y Museo de Minería
The &quot;Archivo Historico y Museo de Minería&quot;—Historic Archive and Museum of Mining is located on Mina Street in a manor that dates from the 19th century, called the Cajas de San Rafael. The mansion is constructed of cantera stone and occupies a space of 950m2.

It contains documents that trace the history of mining here from 1556 to 1967, and the more than a billion ounces of silver and the five million ounces of gold that have been extracted from the state of Hidalgo during that time. The museum has three exhibition halls, a covered courtyard and a garden which contains mining machinery. such as a steam shovel, a winch and a truck used for transport of ore. The exhibition halls contain displays relating to how minerals are found in nature and the tools and processes used to extract them. It also houses a large collection of documents, a library and a photography laboratory. The documentation contained here was rescued starting in 1987. In 1993 the current site was renovated to house the collection. The collection also includes miners&#x27; personal effects, as well as artworks relating to mining.

;Museo de Mineralogía
The &quot;Museo de Mineralogía&quot;—Museum of Mineralogy belongs to the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo. The mineralogy museum is housed in the old Hospital de San Juan de Dios. It was built and operated by monks until 1869, when the state converted the building into the Instituto Literario y Escuela de Artes y Oficios. The museum exhibits a large collection of mineral specimens from the region.

;Municipal Palace—Rule House
The Municipal Palace or Conde Rule House is located on Leandro Valle and Morelos streets. It is a two-story building constructed at the end of the 19th century. The main entrance is flanked by two pilasters and topped with a pediment decorated with reliefs made of shells.

It belonged to a rich Cornish miner by the name of Francis Rule, and later became the Municipal Palace.

; Macromural

The macromural of Pachuta is located in the Palmitas suburb. It consists of an entire quarter on a hillside painted in colourful murals.

; Other attractions
Formerly there was an English/Cornish neighborhood in the central part of Pachuca. The British Consulate is all that remains there, located in an &quot;English style&quot; residence built at the beginning of the 20th century.

The Mercado de Barreteros is on the Central Plaza, and considered one of the most valuable architectural elements in the city. The lower level is dedicated to services such as cafés, and the upper floor is dedicated to arts and crafts shops. The Monument of Christ the King is located on the Santa Apolonia Mountain and is one of the largest in Mexico.

The Archivo del Estado de Hidalgo—Museum of the State of Hidalgo is located in the Civic Centre of the State Congress. Its collection focuses on the history of the state of Hidalgo, through archival photographs and documents. Its collection also includes national history items.
The Museo El Rehilete is an interactive museum for children with exhibits on archeology, botany, other sciences and the arts.

The Sede del Salón de la Fama del Fútbol&quot;—Hall of Fame of Football is in the shape of a football, and located in Parque David Ben Gurion of the Zona Plateada district. The Universidad de Fútbol&quot;—Football University is the only training facility of its kind in the Americas, and one of only a few in the world.

===Education===
The Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo was constructed over the old Hospital de San Juan de Dios. It is the oldest educational institution in Hidalgo, brought into being at the same time as the state. The school was originally established as the Instituto Literario y Escuela de Artes y Oficios (Literary Institute and School of Arts and Letters) in 1869. The school was initially in a rented house but was moved to the former Hospital of San Juan de Dios in 1875. This building is now the Central Building. The school was based on positivist philosophy and the University motto of &quot;Amor, orden y progreso&quot; (&quot;love, order and progress&quot;) remains to this day. The school was renamed the Universidad de Hidalgo in 1925 and again to the Universidad Autónoma de Hidalgo in 1948. The university was reorganized and expanded in 1961.

A more recently established school opened in 2003 is the Universidad Politécnica de Pachuca (Polytechnic University of Pachuca), which is mostly an engineering school. It was temporarily housed in the old Universidad Pedagógica Nacional buildings, but in 2004 the state of Hidalgo ceded the university the old Santa Barbara Hacienda, with 231 students studying classes in Mechatronics, Information technology and Biotechnology at the new facility. New programs of study in Physical Therapy, Software engineering, Optomechatronics, Information security, Information technologies and communications.

==The English/Cornish influence==
===History===

Beginning in 1824, Cornish miners and English investors came to Pachuca and the neighboring town of Real del Monte to invest and work in the mines here. Some founded the Compañía Real de Monte y Pachuca. Mexico&#x27;s remaining Cornish community represents a largely forgotten immigrant story. In the early 19th century, miners in Cornwall were enduring economic hardships. Ships carrying 125 passengers and some 1,500 tons of equipment sailed out of Falmouth, Cornwall, landing in Veracruz three months later. The treacherous 500-kilometre (300 mi) trek inland killed about half of the miners and their family members, many succumbing to malaria and yellow fever. Those who made it settled in Pachuca and Real del Monte.

The immigrants brought technology, notably the famous high-pressure steam pumping engines designed by Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick, which turned many of the area&#x27;s water-logged mines into huge silver producers. The majority of the immigrants to this region came from Cornish mining areas of Camborne, Redruth and Gwennap. Cornish/English workers and their technology revitalized the silver industry here and miners&#x27; remittances sent back home helped to build the Wesleyan Chapel in Redruth in the 1820s.

;Architecture
Today the Pachuca – Real del Monte District retains much from its period of association with Cornwall and home of one of Mexico&#x27;s most enduring cross cultural pollinations. The miners&#x27; influence is obvious in architecture. Up in the hills around Pachuca, many houses feature distinctly British characteristics: thicker walls, square windows and pitched roofs. Some of Pachuca&#x27;s landmarks have English/Cornish influences. The Spanish Baroque style Reloj Monumental (Monumental Clock) chimes to the tune of Big Ben, and was financed by Francis Rule. The city&#x27;s main Methodist church was built by Cornish miners. The English mining company&#x27;s main office as well as the residence of Francis Rule of Camborne, the last Cornish manager of the Real del Monte mine, still bears his initials. The archives of the company are part of the &quot;Historic Archive and Museum of Mining in Pachuca&quot; (&quot;Museo de Minería&quot;) collections, and contain detailed records of Cornish employees, especially between 1824 and 1849.

===Influences===
The Cornish immigrants married into Mexican families, and even today Cornish surnames are not uncommon in this area with hundreds of Cornish descendants present. One example is Umberto Skewes, who speaks little English but whose grandfather came to Mexico from Cornwall. Skewes is custodian of the English Cemetery, which contains approximately 600 graves, predominantly of Cornish miners and their families. The Cornish-Mexican Cultural Society works to build educational links between Mexico and the United Kingdom. The group has marketed Pachuca and Real del Monte as &quot;Mexico&#x27;s Little Cornwall&quot; through the Mexican embassy in London.

Cornish and English miners introduced to Mexico such things as tennis, golf, rugby, cricket, and chess. However the two introductions which have had the greatest influence on Pachuca&#x27;s identity are football and &quot;pastes&quot;.

====Football====
In 1900 Cornish miners established the Pachuca Athletic Club, which was primarily dedicated to football. Their first game was played in the same year, a fact that is celebrated annually. The first team from Pachuca consisted of Charles Dawe, John Dawe, James Bennetts, John Bennetts, William Blamey, Richard Sobey, William Bragg, William Thomas, Percy Bunt, Lionel Bunt, Albert Pengelly and William Pengelly. The Pachuca club encouraged the formation of teams in Mexico City and Orizaba, the first championship of the new Liga Mexicana de Fútbol Asociación was played in 1902. Other clubs, such as the Reform Athletic Club, El British Club, F. C. and El México Cricket Club were also formed by miners. The first Mexican player appears in the ranks of the Pachuca club in 1908 and by 1915, most of the team was Mexican. Pachuca won the Copa Tower in 1908 and 1912, the precedent of the modern Mexican Cup. The team disbanded in the 1920s but was re-instituted in 1951. Pachuca calls itself the &quot;Cradle of Mexican Football.&quot;

====Pastes====

The Mexican Spanish word &quot;paste&quot; (pronounced PAH-steh) come from the Cornish word pasties, which is basically a semi-circular turnover made with a pastry crust with sweet or savory fillings. Cornish miners brought the recipe with them as they made a good way to bring their midday meal with them to the mines. One feature of both pasties and pastes is that they have a thick braided edge. Originally, this was done to provide the miners a way to hold the turnover without getting the filled portion dirty, as there was no way to wash their hands before eating. The shape and pastry portion of the turnover have remained the same but today, the fillings are decidedly Mexican: mole verde, beans, mole rojo, chicken &quot;tinga,&quot; pineapple, rice pudding and one seasonal specialty is a lamb paste with poblano chili peppers. Pastes are a local delicacy strongly identified with both Pachuca and Real del Monte.

==Festivals==

The Feria de Pachuca is known colloquially by several names such as the Feria Tradicional/Internacional de San Francisco, the Feria de Hidalgo and the Feria de Caballo. It is the most important annual event in the state of Hidalgo, taking place every October in facilities located in the south of Pachuca. The festival began as a liturgical event sponsored by monks at the monastery of San Francisco in the 16th century, which eventually drew dignitaries from surrounding communities. The festival sponsors a number of events such as bullfights, cockfights, charreadas, horse shows, rodeos, crafts and folk dance shows, livestock exhibitions and features regional cuisine. It also host concerts by well-known Mexican musical artists.

Other notable events in the city include the Ramón Noble Guitar Festival and the Feria Hidaltur. The first presents concerts by guitarists of various genres from countries such as Brazil, Spain, the U.S., Israel, England and Mexico. There are classes and workshops by renowned artists as well as a national level competition for classical guitar. The Feria Hidaltur is held in March and April with the purpose of promoting the arts and crafts of Hidalgo state. The festival also has equestrian events, hot-air balloons and other attractions.

==Economy==
Despite its decline in the 20th century, mining still continues to be an important element of Pachuca&#x27;s economy. Pachuca still produces more than 60% of the state&#x27;s gold and more than 50% of its silver. The Mexican Geological Survey is headquartered in the city.

The manufacturing sector was established in the 1950s and has been steadily growing, changing the city&#x27;s traditional mining image. Some of the major industrial employers are Applied Power de México (automotive parts), BARROMEX (machinery), Herramientas Cleveland (machinery and tools) and Embotelladora la Minera (soft drinks). The city also contains over 800 smaller manufacturing enterprises.

The municipality&#x27;s economy also has a large commercial sector, with numerous stores and thirteen public markets. It is also the wholesale center for foodstuffs for most of the state.

Despite all the changes in the 20th century, the center of Pachuca has maintained its provincial feel. This has led the city to promote it as a tourist attraction.

==Pachuca Municipality==

The Pachuca Municipality is increasingly co-extensive with the city, as the city&#x27;s metro area development grows to cover over 60% of the available open space. The municipality contains fifteen other communities, with all but two having less than 1500 people according to the 2005 INEGI census. Only three percent of the municipality population of 275,578 lives outside the city boundaries.

== Mines ==

All of Pachuca’s mines worked silver ore which was dressed using the patio process, similar to at Real Del Monte. The last mine to close was El Álamo in 1993 .

<doc id="465064" wikidata="Q382994" url="?curid=465064" title="Molybdenite">
<text>Molybdenite is a mineral of molybdenum disulfide, MoS2. Similar in appearance and feel to graphite, molybdenite has a lubricating effect that is a consequence of its layered structure. The atomic structure consists of a sheet of molybdenum atoms sandwiched between sheets of sulfur atoms. The Mo-S bonds are strong, but the interaction between the sulfur atoms at the top and bottom of separate sandwich-like tri-layers is weak, resulting in easy slippage as well as cleavage planes.
Molybdenite crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system as the common polytype 2H and also in the trigonal system as the 3R polytype.

==Description==
===Occurrence===

Molybdenite occurs in high temperature hydrothermal ore deposits.
Its associated minerals include pyrite, chalcopyrite, quartz, anhydrite, fluorite, and scheelite. Important deposits include the disseminated porphyry molybdenum deposits at Questa, New Mexico and the Henderson and Climax mines in Colorado. Molybdenite also occurs in porphyry copper deposits of Arizona, Utah, and Mexico.
The element rhenium is always present in molybdenite as a substitute for molybdenum, usually in the parts per million (ppm ) range, but often up to 1–2%. High rhenium content results in a structural variety detectable by X-ray diffraction techniques. Molybdenite ores are essentially the only source for rhenium. The presence of the radioactive isotope rhenium-187 and its daughter isotope osmium-187 provides a useful geochronologic dating technique.

===Features===

Molybdenite is extremely soft with a metallic luster, and is superficially almost identical to graphite, to the point where it is not possible to positively distinguish between the two minerals without scientific equipment. It marks paper in much the same way as graphite. Its distinguishing feature from graphite is its higher specific gravity, as well as its tendency to occur in a matrix.

==Uses==
Molybdenite is an important ore of molybdenum, and is the most common source of the metal. While molybdenum is rare in the Earth&#x27;s crust, molybdenite is relatively common and easy to process, and accounts for much of the metal&#x27;s economic viability. Molybdenite is purified by froth flotation, and then oxidized to form soluble molybdate. Reduction of ammonium molybdate yields pure molybdenum metal, which is used for fertilizer, as a catalyst, and in battery electrodes. By far the most common use of molybdenum is as an alloy with iron. Ferromolybdenum is an important component of high strength and corrosion-resistant steel.

===Semiconductor===
Multilayer molybdenite flakes are semiconductors with an indirect bandgap. In contrast, monolayer flakes have a direct gap. In the early years of the 20th century, molybdenite was used in some of the first crude semiconductor diodes, called cat&#x27;s whisker detectors, which served as a demodulator in early crystal radios. Monolayer molybdenite shows good charge carrier mobility and can be used to create small or low-voltage transistors. The transistors can detect and emit light and may have future use in optoelectronics.

<text>Tracfin (acronym for Traitement du renseignement et action contre les circuits financiers clandestins, &quot;Intelligence Processing and Action Against Clandestine Financial Circuits in English&quot;) is a service of the French Ministry of Finances. It fights money laundering.

Tracfin is a unit of the then French Ministry for Economy, Finance and Industry and the Ministry for the Budget, Public Accounts, the Civil Service and State Reform with a statewide reach. Since its foundation in 1990 its aim is to fight against illegal financial operations, money laundering and terrorism financing. It is now a financial intelligence service attached to the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty (Ministère de l’Économie, des Finances et de la Souveraineté industrielle et numérique) named &quot;Traitement du renseignement et action contre les circuits financiers clandestins&quot; (French financial Unit for Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism). 

Its mission is to collect, analyze and exploit financial intelligence with a triple focus:
* the fight against economic and financial crime; 
* the fight against public finance fraud; 
* the defence of the fundamental interests of the nation, notably in the fight against the financing of terrorism and criminal interference.
