<text>Communities in the United States with a Hispanic-majority population as of the 2010 Census are primarily found in the Southwestern United States and in large metropolitan areas elsewhere in the country. The community with the highest percentage of Hispanic residents (among communities with over 100,000 people) is the unincorporated community of East Los Angeles, California, whose population was 97.1% Hispanic. Among incorporated localities of over 100,000 people, the city of Laredo, Texas has the highest percentage of Hispanic residents at 95.6%.

San Antonio, Texas is the largest Hispanic-majority city in the United States, with 807,000 Hispanics making up 61.2% of its population. New York City has the most Hispanic residents, although it is not Hispanic-majority and as such, is defined as a plurality.

<doc id="463290" wikidata="Q4420937" url="?curid=463290" title="Merit system">
<text>The merit system is the process of promoting and hiring government employees based on their ability to perform a job, rather than on their political connections. It is the opposite of the spoils system.

== History ==

The earliest known example of a merit system dates to the Qin and Han dynasties. To maintain power over a large, sprawling empire, the government maintained a complex network of officials. Prospective officials could come from a rural background and government positions were not restricted to the nobility. Rank was determined by merit, through the civil service examinations, and education became the key for social mobility. After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the nine-rank system was established during the Three Kingdoms period. The concept of a merit system spread from China to British India during the 17th century, and then into continental Europe.

=== United States ===
The United States civil service began to run on the spoils system in 1829 when Andrew Jackson became president. The assassination of United States President James A. Garfield by a disappointed office seeker in 1881 proved its dangers. President Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau who believed that the president owed him a civil service position and in not giving him the position, threatened the very being of the Republican Party. In 1883, the system of appointments to the United States federal bureaucracy was revamped by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, which made the merit system common practice. The merit system determines the fitness of the candidate by the ability to pass a written competitive examination, given by a commission of examiners. The answers submitted by candidates must be unsigned, so as to obviate the possibility of favoritism on the part of the examiners. A list is made of the successful candidates, arranged in the order of their merit as shown by the results of the examination. Appointments must be made from this eligible list in the order of rank unless good cause can be shown why one of higher rank should be set aside for one standing lower on the list.

Proponents of the system admit that the system does not always lead to the choice of most competent candidate but is effective in eliminating those most incompetent. In addition the possible exclusion of most competent candidate is outweighed by the system&#x27;s benefits such as limiting the ability of nepotism and political favoritism. The power of appointment being vested in the president of the United States by the United States Constitution, it is not within the power of the United States Congress to fetter the president&#x27;s action by the enactment of laws restricting the exercise of the power of appointments. Thus, in the United States, the merit system has been extensively applied by the voluntary action of the president following self-imposed rules. It has been judicially determined that the civil-service rules promulgated by the president of the United States do not have the force of general law and confer upon members of the civil service no right to invoke the aid of the courts to protect them against violation thereof. They are the president&#x27;s laws, and the president alone can enforce them. Working under the supervision of the president is the Merit Systems Protection Board. The MSPB follows nine core principles when governing the executive branch workforce.

== Performance assessment ==

=== Forced ranking ===
Forced ranking is a system in which performing employees are ranked into groups a company has established. The term &#x27;Rank and Yank&#x27; was created by the former CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch. The &#x27;Rank and Yank&#x27; idea encouraged terminating the employment of poor performers and replacing them with new personnel. Many like Welch and former Chief Executive of Microsoft believe in replacing poor performers while others, such as Tom Barry, former Managing Director at BlessingWhite, believe in &#x27;re-engaging underperforming employees.&#x27;

=== Consequences of performance assessment ===
As the United States has become anti-bureaucratic, it has moved away from the outdated depiction of merit system. Twenty-eight states have established an &#x27;at will&#x27; employment environment where civil service employees can be fired at any time without cause. In 2014 the Department of Veteran Affairs became overwhelmed with problems with scheduling appointments. Congress called for immediate action and ordered the Department of Veteran Affairs to lay off &#x27;miscreant&#x27; employees. Donald F. Kettl explores in his work, &quot;The Merit Principle in Crisis&quot;, whether &#x27;At will&#x27; practices and whether they&#x27;re beneficial to the bureaucratic practices of the government. Kettl states that due to an increase in government programs, firing &#x27;miscreant&#x27; bureaucratic employees would only &#x27;weaken the government&#x27;s ability to steer&#x27;.

==Pros==
The importance of the merit system in a workplace is to provide good quality work to the public. When merit is truly assessed in the process of hiring or promoting personnel, an honest, effective, and productive workplace is created. Employees build organizations and the service they provide to customers allows the organization to be successful. Without its employees or customers, an organization would be doomed. Motivated and happy employees are the key principle of the merit system. Employees who are satisfied with their jobs are likely to provide a higher level of productivity (more work in less time, costing organizations less money), less likely to quit (low or lower employee turnover rates), great communication for voicing workplace concerns (trust and comfort between supervisor and employees), little to no abuse of company benefits/incentives, i.e.: lunch breaks, sick leave, bonuses, etc. Bottom line, administration is responsible for providing and setting the atmosphere and standards of a workplace that result in success.

==Cons==
The merit system has been criticized that it leads to uncooperative behaviors among employees, creating conflict that can negatively affect productivity. It is based on performance compensation that encourages competition among employees, creating a competitive environment that puts employees at odds with one another. This can lead to unwanted behavior that can affect productivity. Disrupting team unity to look better on reviews and personal goals becomes more important than team goals.

<doc id="463294" wikidata="Q399995" url="?curid=463294" title="Interstate 380 (California)">
<text>Interstate 380 (I-380) is a short east–west auxiliary Interstate Highway in the San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California, connecting I-280 in San Bruno to US Route 101 (US 101) near San Francisco International Airport. The highway primarily consists of only three intersections: I-280, State Route 82 (SR 82/El Camino Real), and US 101. Like the nearby I-280, I-380 never connects to I-80, its parent Interstate Highway. However, there is no rule that says that spur routes need to do so. (Similarly, the spur route I-795 branches off from I-695, a beltway around Baltimore, and is only indirectly linked to I-95.)

I-380 is officially known as the Quentin L. Kopp Freeway, named after the prominent California state senator from San Mateo County. This highway was previously named the Portola Freeway to honor the 18th-century Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portolá, whose expedition in 1769–1770 discovered the San Francisco Bay, from a viewpoint on the Sweeney Ridge located between San Bruno and Pacifica.

==Route description==

I-380 begins at a junction with I-280 in San Bruno. This junction was only partially built, with room to accommodate a proposed freeway extension west toward SR 1. The freeway itself lacks overhead guide signs mentioning I-380. It then travels east through the city of San Bruno, intersecting with SR 82 (El Camino Real) before reaching US 101.

At its terminus at US 101, the mainline lanes of I-380 continue to North Access Road. The ramps to and from southbound US 101 provide connections to collector–distributor roads leading directly to San Francisco International Airport, allowing traffic between the Interstate and the airport to avoid merging with the main traffic lanes of US 101.

I-380 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

==History==

There were plans to extend I-380 west to SR 1 (Cabrillo Highway), but, due to the route&#x27;s passing over the San Andreas Fault and opposition from members of the local community, this project was abandoned. The westbound lanes of I-380 branch off to the right at I-280, leaving a wide, paved space which would carry the freeway extension under I-280 toward SR 1. This space is currently often used as storage space for equipment used in highway maintenance. A pair of unused bridges crossing over the I-280 south to I-380 east offramp remain as evidence.

Chapter 2, Article 3, Section 608 of the California Streets and Highways Code legally defines Route 380 as traveling from &quot;Route 1 near Pacifica to Route 280 in San Bruno&quot;, and the exit numbers assigned at I-280 start at 5 instead of 1 or 0.

==Exit list==
Under the official exit list by Caltrans, mileage is measured from the unconstructed western terminus at SR 1 near Pacifica. It starts at the location of the SR 82 interchange, labeling the start of the I-280 ramps at that same point.

<doc id="463301" wikidata="Q137302" url="?curid=463301" title="Mr. Dressup">
<text>Mr. Dressup is a Canadian children&#x27;s television series, starring Ernie Coombs, a former understudy of Fred Rogers, in the title role. It ran on CBC from 1967 to 1996, soon becoming an iconic presence in Canadian media.

==Production==
&quot;Mr. Dressup&quot; was developed and produced by Daniel McCarthy, who later became the head of children&#x27;s programming for CBC Television, as a replacement for &quot;Butternut Square&quot;, on which Mr. Dressup had been a featured character.

==Premise==

The series starred the actor Ernie Coombs as Mr. Dressup. The show aired every weekday morning, Mr. Dressup would lead children through a series of songs, stories, arts, crafts and imagination games, with the help of his puppet friends—a child named Casey and a dog named Finnegan—who lived with him and often played in the tree-house in Mr. Dressup&#x27;s backyard. Some critics likened the series to the American series &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, which started being broadcast a year later in 1968 on the U.S. network PBS and was produced by Coombs&#x27; former professional associate, Fred Rogers. Judith Lawrence was the puppeteer who created Casey and Finnegan, along with other occasional puppet visitors such as Alligator Al and Aunt Bird.

The set for the show included the inside of Mr. Dressup&#x27;s house, with scenes shot in the living room, kitchen and a playroom. This included the Tickle Trunk (where costumes used in make-believe skits were stored) and a long counter where Casey and Finnegan often appeared. Sometimes, the action moved outside to Casey&#x27;s and Finnegan&#x27;s tree house. Typically during a segment, Mr. Dressup would get a costume from the Tickle Trunk, such as one for an animal, policeman or fireman. Donning the costume, he would play the suggested role. Occasionally, when the Tickle Trunk would not open, Mr. Dressup sang a song and tickled the lock, hence its name. The trunk appeared to be magical as it always had the right costumes, in the right sizes, neatly folded at the top of the piles of costumes. Occasionally, Mr. Dressup would need to make an accessory for his costume, which would lead to a craft. Mr. Dressup would draw or made a craft and would sing a song with the puppets. On occasion, Mr. Dressup would also read a book or show a short documentary to the audience. The films were usually silent and Mr. Dressup narrated. He often drew pictures on his drawing board to either illustrate a short story or to play a game with one of his visitors. He would frequently encourage children to try the craft at home or to sing along with the songs.

In later years, Judith Lawrence chose to retire from the show. Rather than cast a new puppeteer in the roles of Casey and Finnegan, a team of new puppeteers was brought in. They hired Karen Valleau (Chester the Crow), Nina Keogh (Truffles), Jani Lauzon (Granny), Ruth Danziger (Annie), Jim Parker (Alex), and Bob Dermer (Lorenzo the Raccoon). These new characters visited Mr. Dressup and, over time, became the lead puppet characters, with Casey and Finnegan gradually being removed from the show. This was done gradually for a transition before Lawrence&#x27;s retirement.

When Casey and Finnegan stopped appearing on the show, an announcement was made that they were attending kindergarten. With the new characters came new sets, including the community centre. During the last 10 years of the show, singer, musician and Yo-Yo champion Mark Kersey appeared as recurring character &quot;Mark the Repairman&quot;.

==Conclusion==
The final episode of &quot;Mr. Dressup&quot; was taped on February 14, 1996, though Coombs, Valleau, and Keogh returned to star in the 2½ hour long &quot;Mr. Dressup&#x27;s Holiday Special&quot; for CBC in 1997, where Mr. Dressup played Santa Claus at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto while showing other Christmas specials and Canadian short cartoons. Coombs spent most of the next few years touring college campuses giving talks about his time on the show aimed at students who grew up with his series. He died of a stroke at the age of 73, on September 18, 2001, in Toronto, Ontario.

Rebroadcasts of the series continued for a decade after it ended, until CBC announced that it was taking &quot;Mr. Dressup&quot; out of its weekday morning lineup and moving it to Sunday mornings, effective July 3, 2006. The final repeat aired on September 3, 2006. In 2017, episodes from the series were included on encore+, a YouTube channel run by the Canada Media Fund and Google Canada. Although the five episodes made available on YouTube in 2017 were deleted in June 2018, they were re-posted a month later in July 2018.

A three DVD box set of selected episodes, entitled &quot;Mr. Dressup: Tickle Trunk Treasures&quot;, was released in 2002, with Judith Lawrence coming out of retirement to play Casey and Finnegan in new introductions for the set.

Due to the long run of the series, several generations of Canadian children, as well as Americans growing up in northern United States regions that received the CBC signal, grew up watching Mr. Dressup and his adventures. Ernie Coombs and the character of Mr. Dressup have become strong Canadian icons and a part of Canadian pop culture.

In 2010, two elements of the series were preserved for public viewing. They were Casey&#x27;s tree house, which is on display in the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Downtown Toronto, and the Tickle Trunk (with assorted props), which was previously on display in the CBC Museum, close to where the tree house is located. The Tickle Trunk was not placed in another museum after the CBC Museum closed.

On November 26, 2012, Mr. Dressup (along with Casey and Finnegan) were featured in a Google Doodle on the Canadian Google website as a tribute to Coombs&#x27; 85th birthday.

In September 2022, Amazon Prime Video greenlit a documentary about the show. &quot;Mr. Dressup: The Magic of Make-Believe&quot;, directed by Robert McCallum, premiered at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival, where it won the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Documentaries. The widely anticipated documentary premiered on Amazon Prime October 10, 2023.

In coverage of the documentary, McCallum claimed the significance of Casey as a pioneer of LGBTQ representation in children&#x27;s television. Although Mr. Dressup referred to Casey as &quot;he&quot; or &quot;him&quot; in the show, Lawrence, Casey&#x27;s creator and puppeteer, remarked that Casey was a character that both boys and girls could relate to, and stated in the film that whenever she was asked if Casey was a boy or a girl, she would just answer &quot;yes&quot;.

<text>Ethel Kennedy ( ; April 11, 1928 – October 10, 2024) was an American human rights advocate. She was the wife of U.S. senator Robert F. Kennedy, a sister-in-law of U.S. president John F. Kennedy, and a daughter of businessman George Skakel.

==Early life and education==
Ethel Skakel was born on April 11, 1928, in Chicago, Illinois, to businessman George Skakel and Ann Brannack. She was the sixth of seven children, with a younger sister named Ann and five elder siblings: Georgeann, James, George Jr., Rushton, and Patricia. 

Her father George was the founder of Great Lakes Carbon Corporation, which later became a division of SGLCarbon. He was of Dutch descent and a Protestant while Ann was of Irish ancestry and practiced the Catholic faith. Their children were raised Catholic, and Ethel, a devout Catholic herself, attended mass regularly throughout her life. 

Kennedy and her siblings were raised in Greenwich, Connecticut. Ethel attended the all-girls Greenwich Academy and graduated from the Convent of the Sacred Heart in the Bronx in 1945. In September 1945, Ethel began her college education at Manhattanville College, where she was a classmate of her future sister-in-law Jean Kennedy. She received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Manhattanville in 1949.

Ethel first met Jean&#x27;s brother Robert F. Kennedy during a ski trip to Mont Tremblant Resort in Quebec in December 1945. During that trip, Robert began dating Ethel&#x27;s older sister Patricia, but after that relationship ended, he began to date Ethel. She campaigned for Robert&#x27;s older brother John F. Kennedy in John&#x27;s 1946 campaign for Congress in Massachusetts&#x27; 11th congressional district and wrote her college thesis on his book &quot;Why England Slept&quot;.

==Marriage and family==

Robert Kennedy and Ethel Skakel became engaged in February 1950 and were married on June 17, 1950, in a Catholic ceremony at the St. Mary Church in Greenwich, Connecticut. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; noted that the marriage &quot;unites two large fortunes&quot;. 

After Robert graduated from law school at the University of Virginia, the family settled in the Washington, D.C. area, and Robert went to work for the Justice Department. In 1952, Ethel and Robert moved into a rooming house in Boston, Massachusetts, and she helped contribute to her brother-in-law John&#x27;s Senate campaign by organizing &quot;tea parties&quot; for potential voters. Several months after the birth of Ethel&#x27;s fourth child, her parents were both killed in a plane crash in Union City, Oklahoma on October 3, 1955.

In 1956, the Kennedys purchased Hickory Hill from Robert&#x27;s brother John and his wife, Jacqueline. The estate was situated on six acres in McLean, Virginia, (west of Washington, D.C.) with a 13-bedroom mansion. Robert and Ethel held many gatherings at their home and were known for their impressive and eclectic guest lists. Ethel sold Hickory Hill for $8.25 million in December 2009. The couple also owned a home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod.

In 1960, Ethel&#x27;s brother-in-law John F. Kennedy won the presidential election, at which time he appointed Robert to the post of attorney general. In 1962, President Kennedy assigned Ethel and Robert to tour 14 countries on a 28-day goodwill trip. Though the trip was said to be informal, the host countries viewed Robert and Ethel as stand-ins for the President and the First Lady.

On November 22, 1963, Ethel first learned of John&#x27;s assassination from her husband. She had answered the phone, identified the caller as Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director J. Edgar Hoover, and handed the phone to Robert, who then informed her of the shooting. Hoover had never called the Attorney General&#x27;s home before. 

In 1964, Ethel supported her husband while he campaigned for and won a seat in the United States Senate, representing New York. During the campaign, Robert was accused of &quot;carpetbagging&quot;, and Ethel made light of the criticism by suggesting the slogan, &quot;There is only so much you can do for Massachusetts.&quot; 

She urged her husband to enter the Democratic primary for the 1968 presidential election. Biographer Evan Thomas portrayed her as Robert&#x27;s &quot;most consistent advocate of a race for the White House&quot;.

===Children===
Ethel Kennedy was frequently pregnant during her 18-year marriage, giving birth to 11 children: Kathleen in 1951, Joseph in 1952, Robert Jr. in 1954, David in 1955, Mary Courtney in 1956, Michael in 1958, Kerry in 1959, Christopher in 1963, Maxwell in 1965, Douglas in 1967, and Rory, who was born after her father was assassinated in 1968. Kathleen served as lieutenant governor of Maryland from 1995 to 2003, Joseph represented Massachusetts&#x27;s 8th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1987 to 1999, and Robert Jr. ran for president in the 2024 presidential election before becoming U.S. secretary of health and human services. Her grandson, Joseph Kennedy III, also served in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Massachusetts&#x27;s 4th congressional district from 2013 to 2021. Kennedy outlived two of her sons, David and Michael, who respectively died from a 1984 drug overdose and a 1997 skiing accident.

===Husband&#x27;s assassination===

Shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy was mortally wounded by Sirhan Sirhan at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles; he died the following day at the age of 42. Ethel was present at the scene and was three months pregnant with daughter Rory at the time. President Lyndon B. Johnson declared a National Day of Mourning. Ethel sent Johnson a handwritten note on June 19, thanking him and his wife, First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, for the help they had given her and the Kennedy family. After her husband&#x27;s assassination, Ethel publicly stated that she would never marry again, wanting to focus on &quot;furthering his work and legacy&quot;. For a time, she was escorted to dinners, parties, and the theater by singer and family friend Andy Williams.

==Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights==
Ethel Kennedy founded the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights (now known as Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights) in 1968. In February 2001, Kennedy visited Rodolfo Montiel and another peasant activist at their jail in Iguala, presenting Rodolfo with the Chico Mendes Award on behalf of American environmental group the Sierra Club. In March 2016, Kennedy was among hundreds who marched near the home of Wendy&#x27;s chairman Nelson Peltz in Palm Beach, Florida, as part of an effort by the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a farm workers&#x27; group, to convince the company to pay an additional one cent per pound of tomatoes to increase the wages of field workers. Kennedy&#x27;s daughter Kerry was president of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, according to the Fund&#x27;s 2022 annual report. 

==Later life and death==
During the late 1970s, with a renewed commitment to public service, Kennedy focused much of her time and energy on various social causes, including the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Project. In 1992, Kennedy and her son Michael made a cameo appearance on the NBC sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot; in Boston.

During the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Kennedy endorsed Barack Obama. She publicly supported and held fundraisers at Hickory Hill for numerous politicians that included Virginia gubernatorial candidate Brian Moran. Kennedy hosted a $6-million fundraising dinner for Obama at Hickory Hill in June 2008. The $28,500-a-plate dinner was headlined by former Democratic presidential candidate and DNC chairman Howard Dean.

In 2012, Kennedy appeared in a documentary about her life, directed by her youngest child, daughter Rory. The documentary, entitled &quot;Ethel&quot;, covers Kennedy&#x27;s early political involvement, her life with Robert F. Kennedy, and the years following his death when she raised eleven children on her own. It features interviews with Kennedy and her children interspersed with family videos and archival photos.

In her later years, Kennedy resided at the Kennedy Compound in Massachusetts and in Palm Beach, Florida. She died in Boston on October 10, 2024, at the age of 96, after being hospitalized for a stroke she had the week prior. Her funeral was held on October 14 at Our Lady of Victory Church in Centerville, Massachusetts. On October 16, a memorial service was held at the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, D.C., with eulogies given by President Joe Biden and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. She is buried at Arlington National Cemetery alongside her husband, Robert.

==Legacy and awards==
In 1981, President Ronald Reagan honored Kennedy with the Robert F. Kennedy medal in the White House Rose Garden. In 2014, a bridge over the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C., was renamed the Ethel Kennedy Bridge in her honor, in recognition of her advocacy for environmentalism and social causes in the District of Columbia. Also in 2014, Kennedy was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama for her dedication to &quot;advancing the cause of social justice, human rights, environmental protection, and poverty reduction by creating countless ripples of hope to effect change around the world&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Ellen Parker portrays Kennedy in the 1983 miniseries &quot;Kennedy&quot;, set during the Kennedy presidency. Marnie McPhail portrays Kennedy in the 2002 television film &quot;RFK&quot;. Kristin Booth portrays Kennedy in the 2011 miniseries &quot;The Kennedys&quot;, set during the Kennedy presidency, and its 2017 sequel &quot;The Kennedys: After Camelot&quot;.

Taylor Swift was inspired to write &quot;Starlight&quot; after seeing a photo of Robert and Ethel Kennedy. The song is from the perspective of Ethel Kennedy, mentioning meeting &quot;Bobby on the boardwalk&quot; (Robert F. Kennedy) and saying &quot;we could get married / have ten kids and teach &#x27;em how to dream&quot; (referencing the eleven kids they would have).

<doc id="463303" wikidata="Q5326365" url="?curid=463303" title="Earl of Rosslyn">
<text>Earl of Rosslyn is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1801 for Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Baron Loughborough, Lord Chancellor from 1793 to 1801, with special remainder to his nephew Sir James St Clair-Erskine, as Wedderburn had no surviving issue of his own. Wedderburn had already been created Baron Loughborough, of Loughborough in the County of Leicester, in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1780, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body, and Baron Loughborough, of Loughborough in the County of Surrey, in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1795, with the same remainder as the earldom. The 1780 barony became extinct upon his death, but the 1795 barony and the earldom passed, by the special remainder, to his nephew, who thus became the second Earl of Rosslyn. The second Earl was a Lieutenant-General in the Army and also held political office as Lord Privy Seal and Lord President of the Council.

His son, the third Earl, was a General in the Army and held political office as Master of the Buckhounds and Under-Secretary of State for War. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl. He served as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms (Chief Government Whip in the House of Lords) in Lord Salisbury&#x27;s second Conservative administration.

, the titles are held by his great-great-grandson, the seventh Earl, who succeeded his father in 1977. He is a former police officer with the Metropolitan Police Service. Lord Rosslyn is also one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits as a cross-bencher.

The Erskine Baronetcy, of Alva in the County of Clackmannan, was created in 1666 for Charles Erskine in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. He represented Clackmannan and Stirling in the Parliament of Scotland. His eldest son, the second Baronet, was killed at the Battle of Landen in 1693. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baronet. He was one of the Scottish representatives to the 1st Parliament of Great Britain and later represented Clackmannanshire. His eldest son, the fourth Baronet, was killed at the Battle of Lauffeld in 1747. His younger brother and successor, the fifth Baronet, was a Lieutenant-General in the Army and sat as Member of Parliament for Ayr Burghs and Anstruther Easter Burghs. Erskine married Janet Wedderburn, daughter of Peter Wedderburn and sister of Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rosslyn. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned sixth Baronet, who in 1805 succeeded his uncle Lord Rosslyn in the barony of Loughborough and earldom of Rosslyn. See above for further history of the baronetcy.

The family seat is Rosslyn Castle in Midlothian, Scotland. The Earl also owns Rosslyn Chapel.

<text>Horsetooth Mountain is a mountain summit in the foothills of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains of North America. The peak is located in the Horsetooth Mountain Open Space, west (bearing 265°) of downtown Fort Collins in Larimer County, Colorado, United States.

==Mountain==
The mountain is easily distinguishable by the large pegmatite rock formation on its summit known as Horsetooth Rock. The formation is a prominent landmark of the nearby city of Fort Collins and often used as a symbol of that city, appearing in the official city seal. The name comes from its distinctive appearance.

The site was previously private property owned by the Soderburg family. In 1982, it was purchased by the county as an &quot;open space&quot; tax acquisition. It is now a popular destination for hikers as well as mountain bikers, with trails leading to the summit. The summit offers hikers a clear view to the southwest of Longs Peak and Mount Meeker, two rugged mountains in Rocky Mountain National Park.

A daily entrance permit costs $10 per vehicle.

==Wildlife==
Horsetooth Mountain Park not only hosts some spectacular scenery, it is home to a variety of large mammals such as mule deer, American black bears, mountain lions and coyotes.

<doc id="463308" wikidata="Q1090300" url="?curid=463308" title="Earl of Craven">
<text>Earl of Craven, in the County of York, is a title that has been created twice, once in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==History==
The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1664 in favour of the soldier William Craven, 1st Baron Craven, the eldest son of Sir William Craven, Lord Mayor of London in 1610. He was made Viscount Craven, of Uffington in the County of Berkshire, at the same time. Both titles were created with remainder to his kinsmen Sir William Craven and Sir Anthony Craven. Craven had already in 1627 been created Baron Craven, of Hamstead Marshall in the County of Berkshire, with remainder to his brothers John (later Baron Craven of Ryton) and Thomas. In 1665 he was also created Baron Craven, of Hamstead Marshall in the County of Berkshire, with remainder to his kinsman Sir William Craven, the son of Thomas Craven, who was the brother of the aforementioned Sir Anthony Craven. Thomas Craven was the grandson of Henry Craven, brother of the aforementioned Sir William Craven, father of the first Earl.

===Baron Craven===
On the Earl of Craven&#x27;s death in 1697, the barony of 1627 and the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. However, he was succeeded in the barony of 1665 according to the special remainder by his kinsman William Craven, the second Baron. He was the son of the aforesaid Sir William Craven, son of Thomas Craven. Lord Craven notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire. On the death of his younger son, the fourth Baron, the line of the second Baron failed. The late Baron was succeeded by his first cousin, the fifth Baron. He was the son of the Honourable John Craven, the younger brother of the second Baron. Lord Craven had earlier represented Warwickshire in the House of Commons. On his death, the title passed to his nephew, the sixth Baron, the son of Reverend John Craven. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire.

===Earl of Craven, 2nd Creation===
His eldest son, the seventh Baron and first Earl, was a Major-General in the Army, and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire. In 1801, he was created Viscount Uffington, in the County of Berkshire, and Earl of Craven, in the County of York, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This first Earl is not entirely forgotten – Harriette Wilson begins her famous memoir, &quot;I shall not say why and how I became, at the age of fifteen, the mistress of the Earl of Craven.&quot; He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire. His son, the third Earl, was briefly Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire. His son, the fourth Earl, was a Liberal politician and served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard in the Liberal administration of H. H. Asquith. the titles are held by his great-great-grandson, the ninth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1990 (who in his turn had succeeded his elder brother in 1983).

The courtesy title of the Earl&#x27;s eldest son is Viscount Uffington.

===Other family members===
Another member of the Craven family was the traveller Keppel Richard Craven (1779–1851). He was the third and youngest son of the sixth Baron Craven. Also, Louisa, Countess of Craven (1785–1860), wife of the first Earl of the 1801 creation, was a well-known actress.

===Family seat===
The current family seat is Hawkwood House near Waldron, East Sussex. Previous family seats have included Hamstead Marshall Park and Lodge and Ashdown Park in Berkshire, and Coombe Abbey in Warwickshire. William Craven, 6th Baron Craven built Craven Cottage in 1780, later to become the home of Fulham F.C.. In Italy, in Varese, they lived at Villa Craven di Seyssel d&#x27;Aix starting from the mid-19th century.

==Earls of Craven, first creation (1664)==
* William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven, 1st Baron Craven (1608–1697)

==Barons Craven (1626; reverted)==
* William Craven, 2nd Baron Craven (1668–1711)

<text>Earl of Onslow, of Onslow in the County of Shropshire and of Clandon Park in the County of Surrey is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1801 for George Onslow, 4th Baron Onslow.

==History==
The Onslow family descends from Arthur Onslow, who represented Bramber, Sussex and Guildford in the House of Commons. He was the husband of Mary, daughter of Thomas Foote, Lord Mayor of London in 1649, who had been created a Baronet in 1660 (a title which became extinct on his death in 1687). In 1674, Onslow was himself created a Baronet in the Baronetage of England, with the precedence of 1660.

Onslow was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet. He was a prominent politician and served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 1708 to 1710 and as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1713 to 1714. In 1716 he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Onslow, of Onslow in the County of Shropshire and of Clandon Park in the County of Surrey, with remainder, failing male issue of his own, to his uncle Denzil Onslow, and afterwards, to the male heirs of his father. Lord Onslow was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He sat as Member of Parliament for Gatton, Chichester, Bletchingley and Surrey and served as Lord Lieutenant of Surrey. His son, the third Baron, represented Guildford in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Surrey. He was heirless on his death in 1776.

Lord Onslow was succeeded according to the special remainder by his second cousin and heir male of his great-grandfather, who became the fourth Baron. He was the son of Arthur Onslow, Speaker of the House of Commons, elder son of Foot Onslow. He was Member of Parliament for Rye and Surrey and notably served as Treasurer of the Household and as Lord Lieutenant of Surrey. In May 1776, five months before succeeding in the barony of Onslow, he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain in his own right as Baron Cranley, of Imber Court in the County of Surrey. In 1801 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Cranley, of Cranley in the County of Surrey, and Earl of Onslow, of Onslow in the County of Shropshire. The latter titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. A grandson, André George Louis Onslow (1784–1853), was a noted composer, and author of thirty string quartets and other works.

His son, the second Earl, represented Rye and Guildford in the House of Commons. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Earl. He died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his great-nephew, the fourth Earl. He was the son of George Augustus Cranley Onslow, son of Thomas Cranley Onslow, second son of the second Earl. Lord Onslow was a prominent Conservative politician and served as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, as Under-Secretary of State for India and as President of the Board of Agriculture and was also Governor of New Zealand. His eldest son, the fifth Earl, was also a Conservative politician. He notably held office as Under-Secretary of State for War and as Paymaster General during the 1920s.

He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Earl. He served in the Conservative administrations of Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard (Deputy Chief Whip in the House of Lords) for nine years. From 1971 to 2011, the titles were held by his son, the seventh Earl, who succeeded in 1971. The seventh Earl was one of the ninety elected hereditary peers who remained in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sat like his ancestors on the Conservative benches. He is the only hereditary peer to have appeared as a panellist on &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;. Upon his death on 14 May 2011, he was succeeded by his son, now the eighth Earl, who inherited Clandon Park, the 1000-acre agricultural Parkland Estate in Surrey in January 2017.

Another member of the Onslow family was the Conservative politician Cranley Onslow. He was a descendant of George Onslow, eldest son of Lieutenant-General Richard Onslow, nephew of the first Baron and uncle of the first Earl. Also, Admiral Sir Richard Onslow, 1st Baronet, was the second son of Lieutenant-General Richard Onslow. See Onslow baronets of Althain for more information on this branch of the family.

The family seat of the Earls of Onslow is Clandon Park in Surrey. Although Clandon House and gardens were gifted and endowed by the Onslow family to the National Trust in 1955, the surrounding agricultural estate called Clandon Park, covering over 1,000 acres and including areas of Grade II-listed parkland, remains in the ownership of The Earl and Countess of Onslow.

The eighth Earl married Leigh Jones-Fenleigh, at Oakham on 10 September 1999 and they have one daughter.

The family&#x27;s coat of arms is: &quot;Argent a fess gules between six Cornish choughs proper&quot;. The supporters are two falcons, proper, belled or. The crest is made up of an eagle sable preying on a partridge or. The motto is &quot;FESTINA LENTE&quot; (Latin: Make haste slowly), although &quot;SEMPER FIDELIS&quot; (Always faithful) is also used. The coat of arms is the basis of the badge of Onslow St Audreys School in Hatfield, Hertfordshire.

<doc id="463313" wikidata="Q692525" url="?curid=463313" title="Wicket-keeper">
<text>In cricket, the wicket-keeper is the player on the fielding side who stands behind the wicket, ready to stop deliveries that pass the batsman, and take a catch, stump the batsman out, or run out a batsman when occasion arises. The wicket-keeper is the only member of the fielding side permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards. The role of the keeper is governed by Law 27 and of the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;.

== Stance ==
Initially, during the bowling of the ball the wicket-keeper crouches in a full squatting position but partly stands up as the ball is received. Australian wicket-keeper Sammy Carter (1878 to 1948) was the first to squat on his haunches rather than bend over from the waist (stooping).

== Purposes ==

The keeper&#x27;s major function is to stop deliveries that pass the batsman (in order to prevent runs being scored as &#x27;byes&#x27;), but he can also attempt to dismiss the batsman in various ways:
* The most common dismissal effected by the keeper is for him to &quot;catch&quot; a ball that has nicked the batsman&#x27;s bat, called an &quot;edge&quot;, before it bounces. Sometimes the keeper is also in the best position to catch a ball that has been hit high in the air. More catches are taken by wicket-keepers than by any other fielding position.
* The keeper can stump the batsman by using the ball to remove the bails from the stumps, if the batsman is out of his crease after a delivery has passed the stumps into the keeper&#x27;s hands. The keeper must then dislodge the bail(s) and the batsman is out if he is still outside the crease.
* When the ball is hit into the outfield, the keeper moves close to the stumps to catch the return throw from a fielder and, if possible, to &quot;run out&quot; a batsman by collecting the ball in his gloves and putting down the wicket.
* If the batter and non-striker attempt to run a bye following the batsman missing or not playing a shot the wicket-keeper can throw the ball at the stumps after he catches the delivery. In outfield cricket, it is a rare play due to the high chance of the non-striker being put out, but when it happens it is usually an important moment where the batting team is trying to desperately score a run to win or tie a game or to get the stronger batter in a partnership on strike so they can bat instead. This play is common during indoor cricket games due to the shorter distance the non-striker has to run and penalty for a wicket being runs, not the loss of the batter themselves. It is common for indoor cricket wicket-keepers to only wear a single glove in order to make throws to the non-striker&#x27;s end easier to hit with.
* The only example of the obstructing the field dismissal in Test cricket came from a batter attempting to hit the ball away from a catch being taken by the wicket-keeper.

A keeper&#x27;s position depends on the bowler: for fast bowling he will squat some distance from the stumps, in order to have time to react to edges from the batsman, while for slower bowling, he will come much nearer to the stumps (known as &quot;standing up&quot;), to pressure the batsman into remaining within the crease or risk being stumped. The more skilled the keeper, the faster the bowling to which he is able to &quot;stand up&quot;, for instance Godfrey Evans often stood up to Alec Bedser.

Like the other players on a cricket team the keepers will bat during the team&#x27;s batting innings. At elite levels, wicket-keepers are generally expected to be proficient batters averaging considerably more than specialist bowlers. This wicket-keeper-batsman form became popular in the 1990s as the Australian national team saw success when elevating Adam Gilchrist to the team after the retirement of Ian Healy. Healy averaged 27.39 and 4,356 runs total from his 119 Test matches, and is viewed as a specialist wicket-keeper who had improved his marginally effective batting toward the end of his career. Gilchrist on the other hand was a dominating, powerful batsman from the start, playing 96 Test matches with a 47.60 average with 5,570 total runs despite playing 23 fewer matches. Gilchrist&#x27;s success effectively forced the specialist wicket-keeper into extinction at the top levels of the sport as teams could no long afford to pick a mediocre or poor batsman in the position as long as the player who was chosen could perform up to basic standards of the wicket-keeper position when fielding.

== Legal specifications of wicket-keeping gloves ==
Law 27.2, which deals with the specifications for wicketkeepers&#x27; gloves, states that:
*If ... the wicket-keeper wears gloves, they shall have no webbing between the fingers except joining index finger and thumb, where webbing may be inserted as a means of support.
*If used, the webbing shall be a single piece of non-stretch material which, although it may have facing material attached, shall have no reinforcements or tucks.
*The top edge of the webbing shall not protrude beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to the top of the thumb and shall be taut when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended.

== Substitutes ==
Substitutes were previously not allowed to keep wicket, but this restriction was lifted in the 2017 edition of the Laws of Cricket.

This rule was sometimes suspended, by agreement with the captain of the batting side. For example, during the England–New Zealand Test match at Lord&#x27;s in 1986, England&#x27;s specialist keeper, Bruce French, was injured while batting during England&#x27;s first innings. England then used four keepers in New Zealand&#x27;s first innings: Bill Athey kept for the first two overs; 45-year-old veteran Bob Taylor was pulled out of the sponsor&#x27;s tent to keep for overs 3 to 76; Bobby Parks, the Hampshire keeper, was called up for overs 77 to 140; and Bruce French kept wicket for the final ball of the innings.

Arthur Jones was the first substitute to keep wicket in a Test match, when he did so against Australia at The Oval in 1905. Virat Kohli once happened to substitute MS Dhoni, as the latter had to attend for his nature&#x27;s call. This incident happened in 2015 during India vs Bangladesh ODI match.

==Playing without a wicket-keeper==
There is no rule stating a team must play with a wicket-keeper. On 5 June 2015 during a T20 Blast game between the Worcestershire Rapids and the Northamptonshire Steelbacks, Worcestershire chose not to play a wicket-keeper in the 16th over of the match. Their keeper, Ben Cox, became an extra fielder at fly slip while spinner Moeen Ali bowled. The umpires consulted with each other and agreed that there was nothing in the Laws to prevent it from happening.

<doc id="463315" wikidata="Q499592" url="?curid=463315" title="Earl of Romney">
<text>Earl of Romney (pronounced &quot;Rumney&quot;) is a title that has been created twice.

It was first created in the Peerage of England in 1694 in favour of the soldier and politician Henry Sydney. He had been made Baron Milton and Viscount Sydney at the same time in 1689. Sydney was the younger son of Robert Sydney, 2nd Earl of Leicester. He never married and the titles became extinct on his death in 1704.

It was created for the second time in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1801 in favour of Charles Marsham, 3rd Baron Romney. The Marsham family descends from Sir John Marsham, one of the six Clerks of the Court of Chancery from 1638 to 1644 and from 1660 to 1680. In August 1663 he was created a Baronet, of Cuckston in the County of Kent, in the Baronetage of England. His grandson, the fourth Baronet (who succeeded his nephew), was also a Clerk of the Court of Chancery and represented Maidstone in the House of Commons. His son, the fifth Baronet, also sat as Member of Parliament for Maidstone and served as Governor of Dover Castle. In 1716 he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron of Romney, of Romney in the County of Kent.

His grandson, the aforementioned third Baron, represented Maidstone and Kent in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Kent. In 1801 he was created Viscount Marsham, of The Mote in the County of Kent, and Earl of Romney, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was Member of Parliament for Hythe and Downton. His son, the third Earl, represented Kent West in the House of Commons. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl, who held political office in the second Conservative government of Lord Salisbury as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from 1889 to 1892.

The line of his eldest son, the fifth Earl, failed on the death of the latter&#x27;s son, the sixth Earl, in 1975. The late Earl was succeeded by his first cousin, the seventh Earl. He was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Reginald Hastings Marsham, second son of the fourth Earl. the titles are held by his first cousin once removed, the eighth Earl, who succeeded in 2004. He is the son of Colonel Peter William Marsham, son of Sydney Edward Marsham, youngest son of the fourth Earl.

The family seat was at Mote House, near Maidstone, Kent, but since 1891 it has been the Gayton Hall Estate at Gayton near Kings Lynn, Norfolk.

<text>The croaking cisticola (Cisticola natalensis) is an Old World warbler in the family Cisticolidae. It is a resident breeder in Africa south of the Sahara. The croaking cisticola is an insectivorous passerine that is found in rank grassland habitats, often near swamps or water. Male cisticolas are polygamous; the female builds a discreet nest deep in the grasses, often binding living leaves into the soft fabric of felted plant-down, cobwebs, and grass. The croaking cisticola&#x27;s nest is a ball shape with a side entrance; 2-4 eggs are laid.

This is the largest cisticola. This warbler is grey-brown above, heavily streaked with black. The underparts are whitish, and the tail is broad, pale-tipped and flicked frequently. It has a chestnut wing-panel and a heavy bill. It is very similar to other members of its genus. It is best distinguished from its many African relatives by its size and froglike croaking &quot;breep-breep&quot; song. The song is always the easiest identification criterion for this genus. These birds are more easily heard than seen, and because of their small size (about ) not always easy to recognise, particularly outside the breeding season when they seldom emerge from their grasses.

<doc id="463320" wikidata="Q3687845" url="?curid=463320" title="Earl of Chichester">
<text>Earl of Chichester is a title that has been created three times, twice in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The current title was created in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1801 for Thomas Pelham, 2nd Baron Pelham of Stanmer.

==Medieval earls of other places==
Modern sources occasionally refer to medieval earls of Chichester in regard to the d&#x27;Aubignys, Earls of Arundel (created 1143) and/or the (de) Montgomeries, Earls of Shrewsbury (created 1074), previously seized of the fiefdom of and castle of Arundel. As earldoms in that era were less defined – an earl could be referred to by various place names, such as the name of the place where he officiated – reference to those holders as such is deprecated.

==First creation (1644)==
The first formal creation of the earldom was in the Peerage of England in 1644, when Francis Leigh, 1st Baron Dunsmore was made Earl of Chichester (in the County of Sussex), with remainder to his son-in-law Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton (the husband of his daughter Elizabeth). He had already been made a baronet, of Newnham, Warwickshire, in 1618 (in the Baronetage of England), with remainder to the heirs male of his body, and Baron Dunsmore of Dunsmore, Warwickshire, in 1628 (in the Peerage of England), with special remainder to his stepson John Anderson (the son of his second wife Audrey Boteler and Sir Francis Anderson).

Lord Chichester as predicted had no sons. On his death in 1653 his baronetcy became extinct, equally the barony of Dunsmore as his stepson Sir John (who was conferred a baronetcy in 1629) had died childless in 1630. The earldom passed to Lord Southampton (see Earl of Southampton for earlier history of this title), who had no male issue; on his death in 1667 both earldoms became extinct.

===Family background===

;Lord Mayor of London, Sir Thomas Leigh
The first earl was the grandson of Sir William Leigh, third son of Sir Thomas Leigh (c. 1504–1571), Lord Mayor of London for 1558.

;Great-uncles of first Earl paternal ancestors of the Barons Leigh
*Sir William&#x27;s eldest brother Rowland was an ancestor of the recipient of the final, second creation in 1838
*Sir William&#x27;s next-eldest brother Sir Thomas was an ancestor of the recipient of 1643-1786 creation and was made a baronet, of the same territorial designation of these baronies, Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, owning Stoneleigh Abbey.

==Second creation (1675)==

The title was created again in the Peerage of England in 1675 however as a subsidiary/courtesy title when Charles Fitzroy, illegitimate son of Charles II and Barbara Villiers, was created Duke of Southampton, Earl of Chichester and Baron Newbury. These titles ended in 1774 on the death of the third holder, who was in the third generation.

==Third creation (1801)==
;Family background
The Pelham family descends from Thomas Pelham of Laughton, Sussex, who represented Lewes and Sussex in the House of Commons. In 1611 he was created a baronet, of Laughton in the Baronetage of England. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet who sat as MP for East Grinstead and Sussex. His son, the third Baronet, represented Hastings and Sussex in Parliament for many years. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Baronet who was as MP for East Grinstead, Lewes and Sussex, served as a Commissioner of Customs and as a Lord of the Treasury.

;Baron Pelham
In 1706 the fourth baronet was raised to the Peerage of England as Lord Pelham, Baron Pelham, of Laughton. He married as his second wife Lady Grace Holles, daughter of Gilbert Holles, 3rd Earl of Clare (see the Earl of Clare).

;Sons of 1st Baron Pelham serving as Prime Minister
The second son of 1st Baron Pelham was the prominent statesman Henry Pelham, Prime Minister 1743–1754.

Henry&#x27;s older brother became the second Baron and served as Prime Minister 1754-1756 and 1757–1762. He inherited vast estates on the death of John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (1662–1711) (his mother&#x27;s brother) and took by Royal licence the additional surname &#x27;Holles&#x27; in 1711. In 1714 the Earldom of Clare was revived in his favour with special remainder to his younger brother, the earlier Prime Minister. Surpassing this, the next year his maternal uncle&#x27;s title was revived; he was made Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne with similar remainder to his younger brother Henry.

In 1756, Henry Pelham having died without male issue, the childless Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne was created Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne which bore special remainder to Henry Pelham-Clinton, 9th Earl of Lincoln – son of his sister Lucy, wife of Henry Clinton, 7th Earl of Lincoln) (this 9th Earl, created 2nd Duke, married his first cousin Catherine, daughter of Henry). In 1762 he was also made Baron Pelham of Stanmer which bore special remainder to his first cousin once removed Thomas Pelham.

;Effect of Special Remainders
The Duke was childless and on his death in 1768 the barony of Pelham and the creations of 1714 and 1715 became extinct. The dukedom of 1756 passed to the Earl of Lincoln. The Duke was also succeeded in the baronetcy and in the barony of Pelham of Stanmer by first cousin once-removed Thomas Pelham, the second Baron. He was the son of Thomas Pelham, Member of Parliament for Lewes, son of Henry Pelham, third son of the third Baronet. Like his cousins, he was also a politician. He represented Rye and Sussex in the House of Commons and served as a Commissioner of Trade and Plantations, as a Lord of the Admiralty and as Comptroller of the Household. In 1801 he was honoured when he was created Earl of Chichester in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was also an influential politician and held office as Chief Secretary for Ireland, as Home Secretary and as Postmaster General. In 1801, during his father&#x27;s lifetime, he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Pelham of Stanmer. His eldest son, the third Earl, was Lord Lieutenant of Sussex from 1860 to 1886. On his death, the titles passed to his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He sat as Liberal Member of Parliament for Lewes. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He was an Anglican cleric including Rector of Lambeth.

The fifth Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, the sixth Earl, who died of pneumonia on 14 November 1926, age 55. His eldest son succeeded but also died of pneumonia having been Earl for eight days, on 22 November. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the eighth Earl, who was killed in a road accident in Doncaster while on active service in the Second World War. He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Earl, born seven weeks after his father&#x27;s death. If the ninth earl had been born a girl or had not survived early childhood, the title would have passed to Henry George Godolphin Pelham (1875–1949), second son of the fifth Earl. The ninth Lord Chichester has served as a board member of music institutions.

==Notable relations==
* George Pelham, third son of the first Earl, served successively as Bishop of Bristol, Exeter and Lincoln. 
* Frederick Thomas Pelham, second son of the second Earl, was Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy. 
* John Thomas Pelham, third son of the second Earl, was Bishop of Norwich. 
**His eldest son Henry Francis Pelham was Camden Professor of Ancient History at Oxford University.

==Seats and other abodes==
The family laid out Stanmer Park and had built and lavishly decorated successions of Stanmer House, Stanmer, East Sussex which it acquired in 1713. In 1947, death duties following the unexpected deaths of three earls from 1926 to 1944 forced trustees for the then-3-year-old ninth earl to sell the estate to a local Council, the Brighton Corporation. The senior branch of the family owns and occupies Little Durnford Manor, Durnford, Wiltshire since 1966.

<doc id="463321" wikidata="Q1482631" url="?curid=463321" title="Interstate 480 (Nebraska–Iowa)">
<text>Interstate 480 (I-480) is a auxiliary Interstate Highway that connects I-80 in Downtown Omaha, Nebraska, with I-29 in Council Bluffs, Iowa. The portion of I-480 in Nebraska has been named the Gerald R. Ford Expressway, named in honor of the former president, who was a native of Omaha. For most of its length, I-480 is overlapped by a US Highway: for with US Highway 75 (US 75) and for with US 6. I-480 includes the Grenville Dodge Memorial Bridge over the Missouri River.

==Route description==

I-480 begins at an interchange with I-80 to the east and west and with US 75, known as the Kennedy Freeway, to the south. Going north, I-480 passes the Hanscom Park neighborhood to the west and the Vinton Street Commercial Historic District to the east. At exit 1A, I-480 intersects Martha Street, which before January 1, 2003, was the eastern end of Nebraska Highway 38 (N-38). North of Martha Street, I-480 passes the Gerald R. Ford Birthsite and Gardens. At the Leavenworth Street exit, the highway divides the Leavenworth neighborhood from the Old Market neighborhood. Shortly after the Leavenworth Street exit is the Harney Street exit, which provides access to US 6 from eastbound I-480. before the North Freeway interchange, I-480 passes beneath Dodge and Douglas streets, which are the westbound and eastbound lanes of US 6, respectively.

Just to the southwest of the Creighton University campus is the North Freeway interchange, where US 75 leaves eastbound I-480 and joins westbound. The North Freeway was originally planned to be an Interstate Highway, &quot;I-580&quot;, connecting northern Omaha to downtown, but this project was canceled with the interchange in midst of construction. A number of so-called ghost ramps can be found, but these are being eliminated during the reconstruction of this interchange. Here, I-480 turns to the east toward Council Bluffs, Iowa. I-480 passes between the NoDo and Downtown Omaha neighborhoods. Farther east, it dips to the southeast near CHI Health Center Omaha, part of the NoDo neighborhood. Immediately before crossing the Missouri River, US 6 joins I-480 to cross into Iowa. This bridge over the Missouri River was constructed in 1965–1966 to replace the old Ak-Sar-Ben Bridge which had been the first highway bridge across the river in this area.

Upon entering Council Bluffs, I-480 meets up with I-29 just from the Missouri River. On the other side of this interchange, I-480 ends where US 6 traffic encounters signal-controlled intersections.

==History==

In the late 1950s, the construction of what was then referred to as Route 3 was highly controversial. It conveniently crossed through the western and northern edges of Downtown Omaha, two areas city leaders had considered &quot;blighted&quot; since the 1930s. The heavily Catholic, ethnic European neighborhoods the route went through rallied against the demolition of their homes, and the city&#x27;s parks advocates provided resistance as well. Eventually, the Interstate planners won out, and the city&#x27;s historic Jefferson Square was demolished, as well as dozens of homes along the route.

In 1999, a bill was introduced in the US House of Representatives that would have extended I-480 south along US 75 in southern Omaha and in Bellevue, Nebraska, then east through Plattsmouth to connect with I-29 near Glenwood, Iowa, which would have increased the length of I-480 to . However, this bill was tabled in the committee.

In 2004, the Nebraska Department of Roads (now the Nebraska Department of Transportation [NDOT]) began a project to reconstruct the I-480/US 75 interchange. Work took place in three phases spread out over the course of six years. The final phase of the $52-million project was funded with $13 million ($ and $ in , respectively) in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 stimulus money. The project was completed in May 2011 just in time for the College World Series.

In March 2021, the Iowa DOT began a project to improve the I-29/I-480/West Broadway System Interchange at I-480&#x27;s eastern terminus. The project was done to improve traffic flow, safety, and the functional design at that interchange as well as at the adjacent I-29 interchanges at 41st Street, 35th Street, Avenue G and 9th Avenue. The project is projected to be completed by the end of 2024.

<text>Earl of Wilton, of Wilton Castle in the County of Herefordshire, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1801 for Thomas Egerton, 1st Baron Grey de Wilton, along with the subsidiary title of Viscount Grey de Wilton, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Both titles were created with remainder to the second and all younger sons successively of his daughter Eleanor, wife of Robert Grosvenor, 1st Marquess of Westminster.

==History==

The 1st Earl of Wilton was a member of the Egerton family and the eldest son of Sir Thomas Grey Egerton, 6th Baronet of Egerton and Oulton. He had earlier resided at Heaton Hall near Manchester and represented Lancashire in Parliament.

He was a descendant of Sir Roland Egerton, 1st Baronet, who had married Bridget Grey, sister and co-heir of Thomas Grey, 15th Baron Grey de Wilton, who was attainted in 1603 and forfeited his title. In 1756, Thomas Egerton succeeded his father as 7th Baronet and in 1784 was created Baron Grey de Wilton, of Wilton Castle in the County Hereford, in the Peerage of Great Britain, with remainder to the heirs male of his body.

When the 1st Earl of Wilton died in 1814, the Grey de Wilton barony became extinct as he had no male heirs, while the Grey Egerton baronetcy passed to his kinsman John Grey Egerton, who became the 8th Baronet. The titles of &quot;Earl of Wilton&quot; and &quot;Viscount Grey de Wilton&quot; passed, according to the special remainder, to the 1st Earl&#x27;s grandson Thomas Grosvenor, who adopted the surname of Egerton and became the 2nd Earl. He was the second son of Lady Eleanor Egerton (and her husband, the 1st Marquess of Westminster), the younger brother of Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, and the elder brother of Lord Robert Grosvenor, who was created Baron Ebury in 1857. The 2nd Earl notably served as Lord Steward of the Household in 1835, in the Tory administration of Sir Robert Peel.

His eldest son, who became the 3rd Earl of Wilton, had represented Weymouth and Bath in Parliament as a Conservative. In 1875, seven years before the 3rd Earl had succeeded his father, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Grey de Radcliffe, in the County Palatine of Lancaster. However, the 3rd Earl was childless, and on his death in 1885, this barony became extinct. He was succeeded in his other titles by his younger brother, who became the 4th Earl of Wilton.

On the death in 1999 of his great-grandson, the 7th Earl of Wilton, the line of the 2nd Earl failed. He was succeeded according to the special remainder by his kinsman Francis Egerton Grosvenor, 6th Baron Ebury (a great-great-grandson of Robert Grosvenor, 1st Baron Ebury, younger brother of the second Earl), who became the 8th Earl of Wilton.

<text>The Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service (SFS) is the school of international relations at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. It grants degrees at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Founded in 1919, SFS is the oldest continuously operating school for international affairs in the United States, predating the U.S. Foreign Service by six years. 

SFS was established by Edmund A. Walsh with the goal of preparing Americans for various international professions in the wake of expanding U.S. involvement in world affairs after World War I. Today, the school hosts a student body of approximately 2,250 from over 100 nations each year. It offers an undergraduate program based in the liberal arts, which leads to the Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service (BSFS) degree, as well as eight interdisciplinary graduate programs. 

Based in Washington, D.C., the school also maintains campuses in Doha, Qatar, and Jakarta, Indonesia. SFS is a founding member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs (APSIA), a consortium of the world&#x27;s leading public policy, public administration, and international affairs schools.

==History==
===20th century===

With the help of Georgetown University president Fr. John B. Creeden, S.J., Fr. Walsh spearheaded the founding of the School of Foreign Service and its establishment was announced on November 25, 1919. The school&#x27;s use of the name “Foreign Service” preceded the formal establishment of the U.S. Foreign Service by six years. The school was envisioned by Fr. Walsh to prepare students for all major forms of foreign representation from commercial, financial, consular to diplomatic.

In 1921, it graduated its first class of Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service (BSFS) undergraduate students. The following year, the school began to offer the first international relations graduate program in the United States, the Master of Science in Foreign Service (MSFS).

In August 1932, the SFS was moved to the Healy Hall, a National Historic Landmark. In 1958, two years after the death of Fr. Walsh, the school was renamed after him and moved to the Walsh Building in a ceremony dedicated by President Eisenhower in honor of Fr. Walsh.

In 1936, the SFS Division of Business and Public Administration launched the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) degree. In 1957, under the leadership of Fr. Joseph Sebes, S.J, the division was spun off from the SFS, becoming the School of Business Administration — later renamed McDonough School of Business in honor of Robert Emmett McDonough (SFS&#x27;49).

In 1962, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) was founded at Georgetown University as a think tank to conduct policy studies and strategic analyses of political, economic and security issues throughout the world. When Henry Kissinger retired from his position as U.S. Secretary of State in 1977, he declined offers of professorship from Harvard, Yale, Penn, Columbia, and Oxford, and decided to teach at Georgetown SFS instead, making CSIS the base for his Washington operations. In 1986, the university&#x27;s board of directors voted to sever all ties with CSIS.
Since 1982, the school has been housed in the Edward B. Bunn, S.J. Intercultural Center (ICC) on Georgetown&#x27;s main campus. In 1989, the Salaam Intercultural Resource Center, which is located on the top floor of the ICC, was opened in a ceremony presided by President Jimmy Carter. The center is a gift by Hany M. Sala&#x27;am and has housed the school&#x27;s MSFS program since 1989.

In 1975, the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies (CCAS) was launched as the first academic institution in the United States to focusing exclusively on the Arab world. CCAS is a National Resource Center on the Middle East and North Africa (NRC-MENA) and funded by Title VI grants from the U.S. Department of Education, in addition to donation from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) governments. In 1999, King Abdullah II of Jordan (MSFS&#x27;87) dedicated a new facility for the center.

In 1978, the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy (ISD) was founded to bring together diplomats, practitioners and scholars to study diplomatic statecraft theory and practice. Past ISD fellows include Georgian deputy prime minister Giorgi Baramidze and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. From 1975 until 2016, the ISD also awarded the &quot;Edward Weintal Prize for Diplomatic Reporting&quot; to journalists in recognition of their distinguished reporting on foreign policy and diplomacy.

In 1992, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, the SFS launched the Pew Economic Freedom Fellows Program to train future leaders of transitional states from Eastern Europe and post-Soviet countries. Notable fellows include Latvian finance minister Uldis Osis, Kazhastan deputy prime minister Kairat Kelimbetov, and Lithuania president Dalia Grybauskaite, who was later awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree by Georgetown University in 2013.

In 1995, the Security Studies Program (SSP), which was founded in 1977 as the National Security Studies Program (NSSP) and hosted at the U.S. Department of Defense headquarters in the Pentagon, was moved to Georgetown&#x27;s main campus and incorporated into the SFS.

===21st century===
In 2002, the school studied the feasibility of opening a campus in Qatar Foundation&#x27;s Education City in Doha, Qatar. In 2005, the School of Foreign Service in Qatar (SFS-Q) was officially opened and welcomed its first class of undergraduate students. In 2015, the school was renamed to Georgetown University in Qatar (GU-Q) as it broadened its remit to include executive masters and professional programs.

In 2005, Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal gave $20 million to the school&#x27;s Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding to promote interfaith understanding and the study of the Muslim world. The gift was the second-largest ever given to Georgetown at that point, and the center was renamed in his honor.

In 2011, following the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton launched the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS) and served as its founding chair.

In June 2023, the administrators announced the plan to rename the school in honor of the late Madeleine Albright, who served as a professor at SFS both before and after her tenure as U.S. secretary of state. It attracted criticism due to Albright&#x27;s controversial legacy and the lack of consultation with the school&#x27;s community members. In October 2023, Georgetown announced that it was no longer considering renaming the school after Albright.

In November 2023, Indonesian president Joko Widodo announced Georgetown&#x27;s partnership with the Indonesian government to open a satellite campus in the country. In January 2025, Georgetown SFS Asia-Pacific (GSAP) campus was launched in Jakarta, Indonesia, to offer graduate masters and visiting student programs.

==Academics==

===Undergraduate program===
The Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service (BSFS) degree is offered by the School of Foreign Service. The degree is rooted in the liberal arts. Following completion of the core requirements, students declare one of the following interdisciplinary majors:

The school&#x27;s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy also offers the Executive Master in Diplomacy and International Affairs (EMDIA) at the SFS campuses in Doha, Qatar, and Jakarta, Indonesia. SFS is a member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs (APSIA), a global consortium of schools that trains leaders in international affairs.

Additionally, exceptional undergraduate SFS students can apply for the accelerated bachelor’s/master’s dual-degree program, which allows enrollment in one of the graduate programs (e.g. BSFS/MSFS, BSFS/MASIA, etc.) during the final undergraduate year and completion of both degrees in approximately five years.

===Certificates===
Georgetown offers a number of undergraduate and graduate certificate programs: African studies, Arab studies, Asian studies, Australian &amp; New Zealand studies, German and European studies, international business diplomacy (honors program), international development, Muslim-Christian understanding, Jewish civilization, justice &amp; peace studies, Latin American studies, medieval studies, Russian &amp; East European studies, social &amp; political thought, and women&#x27;s and gender studies.

== Rankings ==
Georgetown&#x27;s programs in international relations have consistently ranked among the best in the world in surveys of the field&#x27;s academics that have been published biennially since 2005 by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;. In 2014 and in 2018 &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; ranked Georgetown&#x27;s master&#x27;s programs first in the world and its bachelor&#x27;s programs fourth. In 2024, Georgetown&#x27;s master&#x27;s programs were ranked first by all three groups of respondents: international relations faculty, policymakers, and think tank staffers. Its bachelor&#x27;s programs were ranked first by policymakers and think tank staffers and third by international relations faculty.

In a &quot;Pipeline to the Beltway&quot; survey of makers of American foreign-policy from 2011, Georgetown ranked second overall in the quality of preparation for a career in the U.S. government, regardless of degree earned. In 2023, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Georgetown fifth for graduate studies in global policy and administration. In 2024, &quot;Niche&quot; ranked Georgetown first in the United States for international relations.

==Student life==

There are a vast array of clubs and student organizations at Georgetown that students from the SFS join. The elected representative organization of the SFS is the SFS Academic Council (SFSAC), which advocates for the SFS student body and works with the Dean&#x27;s Office to address student concerns, spearhead new initiatives, and coordinate events. The School of Foreign Service also sponsors a flagship peer-reviewed academic publication, the &quot;Georgetown Journal of International Affairs&quot; (GJIA), which is published by Johns Hopkins University Press and run by undergraduate and graduate students.

==Campuses==

The School of Foreign Service main campus, which is part of the main campus of Georgetown University, is located in the Georgetown neighborhood in Northwest Washington, D.C. In 2005, it opened another campus, the School of Foreign Service in Qatar (also known as SFS-Q or GU-Q), in Qatar Foundation&#x27;s Education City in Doha, Qatar. In 2025, the school opened a facility in Jakarta, Indonesia, known as Georgetown SFS Asia-Pacific (GSAP), in partnership with the Indonesian government. Many SFS undergraduates spend a minimum of one semester or a summer abroad, choosing from direct matriculation programs around the globe as well as programs of other universities and those run by Georgetown, including SFS-Q, GSAP and Villa Le Balze.

<doc id="463326" wikidata="Q5326312" url="?curid=463326" title="Earl of Limerick">
<text>Earl of Limerick is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of Ireland, associated first with the Dongan family, then with the Pery family. It should not be confused with the title Viscount of the City of Limerick (usually shortened to Viscount of Limerick, or Lord Limerick) held by the Hamilton family also Earls of Clanbrassil.

==First creation==
The earldom was created for the first time in 1686 for Sir William Dongan, 4th Baronet, with remainder, failing male issue of his own, to his brothers Robert, Michael and Thomas and the heirs male of their bodies. He had been made Viscount Dungan, of Clane in the County of Kildare in 1661, also in the Peerage of Ireland and with similar remainder. His only son Walter Dungan, Viscount Dungan, was killed at the Battle of the Boyne and Lord Limerick was succeeded according to the special remainders (and normally in the baronetcy) by his brother Thomas Dongan, the second Earl. He was Governor of New York from 1683 to 1688. All three titles became extinct on his death in 1715. The Dungan Baronetcy, of Castletown in the County of Kildare, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland in 1623 for Walter Dungan.
He was the eldest son of John Dongan or Dungan (died 1592), originally of  Fishamble Street, Dublin and his wife Margaret Forster. John Dongan was a civil servant who became a figure of some importance in the Irish Government, and was rich enough in later life to acquire substantial estates in County Kildare.

==Second creation==
The title was created for the second time in 1803 in favour of Edmund Pery, 1st Viscount Limerick. He was the son of the Right Reverend William Pery, Bishop of Limerick from 1784 to 1794. In 1790 the latter was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Glentworth, of Mallow in the County of Cork. He was succeeded by his only son, the second Baron. He represented Limerick City in the Irish House of Commons and was a supporter of the Union with Great Britain. On 29 December 1800 he was created Viscount Limerick, of the City of Limerick, and on 11 February 1803, he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Limerick, of the County of Limerick. Both titles were in the Peerage of Ireland. Lord Limerick sat in the House of Lords as one of the 28 original Irish representative peer from 1800 to 1844. In 1815 he was also created Baron Foxford, of Stackpole Court in the County of Limerick, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, giving him a permanent seat in the Lords. His great-grandson, the third Earl, was a Conservative and Unionist politician and served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1889 to 1892 and from 1895 to 1896. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his half-brother, the fifth Earl. He was a soldier and also served as President of the Medical Research Council between 1952 and 1960. His eldest son, the sixth Earl, was a successful businessman. Lord Limerick also served as Under-Secretary of State of Trade from 1972 to 1974 in the Conservative administration of Edward Heath. As of 2014, the titles are held by his son, the seventh Earl, who succeeded in 2003.

Another member of the Pery family was Edmund Pery, 1st Viscount Pery, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons from 1771 to 1785. He was the elder brother of the first Baron Glentworth.

Some heirs to the earldom have used the title &quot;Viscount Glentworth&quot; as a courtesy title (instead of the &quot;real&quot; title of Baron Glentworth), although there is no such peerage.

The family seat was Dromore Castle, near Pallaskenry, County Limerick.

<text>The Brussels Metro ( ; ) is a rapid transit system serving a large part of the Brussels-Capital Region of Belgium. It consists of four conventional metro lines and three &quot;premetro&quot; lines. The metro-grade lines are M1, M2, M5, and M6 with some shared sections, covering a total of , with 59 metro-only stations. The &quot;premetro&quot; network consists of three tram lines (T4, T7, and T10) that partly travel over underground sections that were intended to be eventually converted into metro lines. Underground stations in the &quot;premetro&quot; network use the same design as metro stations. A few short underground tramway sections exist, so there is a total of of underground metro and tram network. There are a total of 69 metro and &quot;premetro&quot; stations as of 2011.

The Brussels Metro was planned at the beginning of the 1960s to become a fully underground network. The original network, running between De Brouckère and Schuman, was inaugurated on 17 December 1969 as &quot;premetro&quot; tramways, which were later, in 1976, converted into the common section of the first two metro lines. These lines were then considered a single line with two branches, between De Brouckère and Tomberg and De Brouckère and Beaulieu. On 4 April 2009, with the completion of the &quot;loop&quot; of line 2 connecting Delacroix and Gare de l&#x27;Ouest/Weststation, the Brussels Metro was significantly reorganised.

The Brussels Metro is administered by the Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company (STIB/MIVB). In 2011, it was used for 125.8 million journeys, and it was used for 138.3 million journeys in 2012. It is also an important means of transport, connecting with six railway stations of the National Railway Company of Belgium (NMBS/SNCB), and many tram and bus stops operated by STIB/MIVB, as well as with Flemish De Lijn and Walloon TEC bus stops. Additionally, some metro stations offer suburban railway links as part of the Brussels Regional Express Network (RER/GEN) system. 

On 22 March 2016, Maelbeek/Maalbeek metro station was bombed, killing about 20 people and injuring 106. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility.

==History==
===Early history===
The Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company ( or , or ) was created in 1954. The first underground tramway (or &quot;premetro&quot;) line was built between 1965 and 1969, from Schuman to De Brouckère. In 1970, a second line was opened, between Madou and Porte de Namur/Naamsepoort. An underground station at Diamant was opened in 1972 and the Greater Ring line was extended from Diamant to Boileau in 1975. This underground tramway section has not been developed further, and it is used by tramway lines 7 and 25. Rogier station was inaugurated in 1974.

===Opening and extensions===
On 20 September 1976, the first metro line opened. One branch went from De Brouckère to Beaulieu (in Auderghem), and the other one linked De Brouckère with Tomberg (in Woluwe-Saint-Lambert). The same year, the North–South Axis (&quot;premetro&quot;) was opened between Gare du Nord/Noordstation (Brussels-North Station) and Lemonnier. In 1977, two new stations were built; Sainte-Catherine/Sint-Katelijne, which replaced De Brouckère as the last western stop in the City of Brussels, and Demey, which replaced Beaulieu as the last stop of the southern branch.

The next extension was the opening of stations in Molenbeek-Saint-Jean (Beekkant, the new terminus, Etangs Noirs/Zwarte Vijvers and Comte de Flandre/Graaf van Vlaanderen). In 1982, line 1 was split into line 1A from Bockstael (in Laeken, a former municipality now merged with the City of Brussels) to Demey (Auderghem) and line 1B from Saint-Guidon/Sint-Guido (in Anderlecht) to Alma (at the Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) campus in Woluwe-Saint-Lambert). Three years later, line 1A was extended to Heysel/Heizel (near the site of the 1958 World&#x27;s Fair and the Heysel Stadium) at one end and to Herrmann-Debroux at the other. That year also saw the opening of Veeweyde/Veeweide on line 1B, and Louise/Louiza on the &quot;premetro&quot; line under the Small Ring (from Louise/Louiza to Rogier).

This line was extended to Simonis the next year and opened as metro line 2 in 1988, from Simonis to Gare du Midi/Zuidstation (Brussels-South Station). Crainhem/Kraainem and Stockel/Stokkel also opened that year on line 1B. At the other end of this line, Bizet opened in 1992. It was then the turn of line 2 to reach Clemenceau in 1993. The &quot;premetro&quot; section known as the North–South Axis, sometimes referred to as line 3, was extended to Albert that year with five new &quot;premetro&quot; stations (Brussels-South, Porte de Hal/Hallepoort, Parvis de Saint-Gilles/Sint-Gillis Voorplein, Horta and Albert).

In 1998, Roi Baudouin/Koning Boudewijn opened on line 1A. Four stations opened in 2003 on line 1B; La Roue/Het Rad, CERIA/COOVI, Eddy Merckx, and Erasme/Erasmus. With the opening of Delacroix in September 2006, line 2 was extended beyond Clemenceau. A further extension to Gare de l&#x27;Ouest/Weststation (Brussels-West Station) in April 2009 closed the &quot;loop&quot; of line 2 and led to a major restructuring of metro service.

The Brussels Metro system is complemented by an S-train network serving the broader metropolitan region and opened in late 2015.

===2016 Brussels bombings===
On 22 March 2016, the Islamic State bombed Maelbeek/Maalbeek metro station in a terrorist attack that coincided with another bomb attack at Brussels Airport. The bombing at Maelbeek station killed twenty people. The incident prompted the temporary closure of the entire system, and a major reduction in service for several weeks. A fundamental review of security procedures on the metro is underway as of 2016.

==Lines and stations==


The &quot;premetro&quot; lines are powered (like the ground-level tram lines) by overhead lines at 600 V DC; the conventional metro lines use instead an elevated third rail at 900 V DC. They all use standard-gauge. Conventional metro platforms are &quot;high platforms&quot;, built flush with the floor of the metro compartments; &quot;premetro&quot; platforms are the same height, but with a lowered section at least as long as the longest tram, for compatibility with tramways which must be able to take passengers from the sidewalk of a street, or even from the street floor itself. Upgrading a line from &quot;premetro&quot; to metro service includes, among others, raising the whole platform to metro height and replacing the overhead line by a third rail power supply .

===Metro===
There are four conventional metro lines and, , 59 stations (not including &quot;premetro&quot; stations). Most stations are underground, although some on lines 5 and 6 are at ground level. On 4 April 2009, the connection at Gare de l&#x27;Ouest/Weststation that enables line 2 to form a circular line was put into service. As a consequence, the metro network was significantly reorganised. The development plan for this change and related tram and bus network changes was approved by the Brussels-Capital Region in July 2005.

As of 4 April 2009, the four lines are as follows: 
* Line 1 from Gare de l&#x27;Ouest/Weststation to the west to Stockel/Stokkel at the east end (formerly part of line 1B);
* Line 2 is a loop starting and ending in Simonis via the eastern side of the Small Ring (an extension of former line 2 from Delacroix north-bound to Simonis);
* Line 5 from Erasme/Erasmus to the south-west to Herrmann-Debroux to the south-east (combines parts of former lines 1A and 1B);
* Line 6 from Roi Baudouin/Koning Boudewijn to the north-west to Simonis (including the loop of the newly extended line 2; combines the former line 2, the new connection, and a branch of the former line 1A).

===Premetro===

Line 4 and Line 10 are tram lines using the North–South Axis tunnel which crosses the city centre from Brussels-North via Brussels-South to Albert. Line 4 runs from Brussels-North to Stalle Parking in the south. Line 10 runs from Hôpital Militaire/Militair Hospitaal in the north to Churchill in the south. This North–South Axis is being upgraded to metro service; works have begun in 2019, including north-eastward prolongation of the metro tunnel, and the transition to conventional metro is foreseen for 2030.

Line 7 is the main line of the Greater Ring, replacing Tram 23 and Tram 24 as of 14 March 2011. It services the Heysel/Heizel, runs under Laeken Park and then via the Greater Ring to the terminus of Line 10 to terminate one stop later at Vanderkindere for connections to tram lines 4, 10 and 92. The somewhat shorter Line 25 also runs the Greater Ring &quot;premetro&quot;, but with different termini at both ends, and the southern terminus connecting to Boondael/Boondaal railway station.

==Ticketing==
MoBIB is the STIB/MIVB electronic smart card, introduced in 2007, replacing the discontinued paper tickets. It uses contactless technology based on the Calypso system originally developed for Paris and is in some ways similar e.g. to the London&#x27;s Oyster card. All metro stations, buses and trams have MoBIB readers.

There is a very wide range of ticket shares to meet different needs. The cost of travel with STIB/MIVB means of transport (metro, tram and bus) is calculated per hour. As long as the journey does not exceed one hour after the first validation of the ticket, it is possible, for example, to switch from a bus to a metro train within the STIB/MIVB network without paying a second time (i.e. a new validation is required but will not be charged). Each trip has a different cost depending on the type of support purchased. Passengers can purchase monthly passes, yearly passes, 1 and 10-trip tickets and daily and 3-day passes. These can be bought over the Internet, but require customers to have a smart card reader. GO vending machines accept coins, local and international chip and PIN credit and debit cards. 

Moreover, a complimentary interticketing system means that a combined STIB/MIVB ticket holder can also use the train network operated by NMBS/SNCB and/or long-distance buses and commuter services operated by De Lijn or TEC, depending on the option. With this ticket, a single journey can include multiple stages across the different modes of transport and networks.

Following a successful trial in 2019, and expedited by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is now possible to pay for STIB/MIVB journeys using a contactless bank card.

==Rolling stock==
The Brussels Metro is served by 217 carriages of M1-M5 series, manufactured by La Brugeoise et Nivelles, ACEC, Bombardier Transportation, Alstom and CAF and delivered between 1976 and 1999, as well as 21 six-car trainsets of the new M6 series (also known as &quot;Boa&quot;), manufactured by CAF and delivered between 2007 and 2012. A new train type known as M7 series was commissioned on lines 1 and 5 in 2021 and will support full automation.

==Future==
A new metro line 3 is being created from Brussels-North through Schaerbeek towards Bordet. The plan was finally approved in 2013, aiming to start construction in 2018 and operation in 2022. Eventually, this would be linked up with a new southbound line to Uccle (Héros/Helden), which will not be finished before 2025.
In 2021, the &quot;premetro&quot; line from Brussels-North to Albert, the route of tram lines 3 and 4, is being upgraded and will be incorporated into the new metro line 3. The present Lemonnier station will be replaced by a new station named after Toots Thielemans under the /.

<text>Toowoomba ( ), nicknamed &#x27;The Garden City&#x27; and &#x27;T-Bar&#x27;, is a city on the border of South East Queensland and Darling Downs regions of Queensland, Australia. It is located west of Queensland&#x27;s capital, Brisbane. The urban population of Toowoomba as of the was 142,163, having grown at an average annual rate of 1.45% over the previous two decades. Toowoomba is the second-most-populous inland city in Australia after the nation&#x27;s capital, Canberra. It is also the second-largest regional centre in Queensland and is often referred to as the capital of the Darling Downs, or the 4th biggest city in South East Queensland after Brisbane, Gold Coast, &amp; the Sunshine Coast. The city serves as the council seat of the Toowoomba Region.

Toowoomba, one of Australia&#x27;s oldest inland cities, was founded in 1849 on the lands of the Giabal and Jarowair people. The city&#x27;s central streets were named after the history of the House of Stuart. The city became the viceregal summer retreat of Queensland&#x27;s governors. The city witnessed several significant events during Australia&#x27;s Victorian period, including the War of Southern Queensland and Battle of One Tree Hill. During the Federation period, Toowoomba emerged as a major artistic and cultural centre with the establishment of the Austral Society.

Toowoomba, a city renowned for its cathedrals and universities, is celebrated for its preserved Victorian-era and traditional Queenslander architecture, historic churches and gardens, and vibrant food, and coffee culture. The city boasts street art, laneways, and numerous nature trails. The city experiences a distinct four seasons and is home to festivals including the Carnival of Flowers. Notable landmarks include Queens and Laurel Bank Park, the Empire Theatre, St James&#x27; Palace, and Mt Meewah.

==Etymology==
The exact origin of the city&#x27;s current name is unknown, although it is widely accepted that the name derives from an Aboriginal language.

When Toowoomba was first discovered by Europeans, it was named &quot;Drayton Swamp&quot; (in reference to the Toowoomba Swamp) and was often nicknamed &quot;The Swamp&quot;. One theory is that after European settlement, the local Aboriginal people referred to it as &quot;Tawampa&quot;, which is borrowed from &quot;The Swamp&quot;.

Another theory is that it derives from the name &quot;Toogoom&quot;. This theory was first proposed by author Steele Rudd in a letter to the Toowoomba City Council. He claimed that his father told him that in 1848, he first saw Toowoomba and that he assisted in laying it out the following year. He believed that it derived from the native name &quot;Toogoom&quot; because of the reeds that grew in the area. Rudd also wrote that he remembered that the original Aboriginal name for &quot;The Swamp&quot; was &quot;Chinkery Yackan&quot; meaning &quot;water like the stars&quot;.

Another theory was proposed by the wife of pioneer Toowoomba resident Thomas Alford. She claimed to have asked the Aboriginals what they called the area; they replied with &quot;Woomba Woomba&quot;, meaning &quot;the springs and the water underneath&quot;. However, she claimed that the Alfords thought this would not be a suitable name for their house and store, so they added the prefix &quot;too-&quot; and omitted one &quot;Woomba&quot; (as this would be a synonym of &quot;two Woomba&quot;), hence &quot;Toowoomba&quot;.

In 1875, William Henry Groom wrote an account of Toowoomba. He stated that &quot;Toowoomba&quot; derived from the Aboriginal term &quot;great in the future&quot;. However, he did not provide a source for his information.

Another theory was proposed by botanist Archibald Meston in a book titled &quot;A Geographical History of Queensland&quot;. He wrote:

While this melon still exists and can be found in areas along the Balonne and Warrego Rivers, as well as in areas closer to Toowoomba, there is no evidence that the melon grew near the Toowoomba swamps.

A man named Enoggera Charlie proposed another theory in a news story he wrote for the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;. He claimed that when he was looking for work as a tar boy, he camped overnight near the Toowoomba Swamp. He claimed that when he asked a shepherd about the naming of the Toowoomba Swamp, he was told that near the junction of the East and West Swamps, there was a log with an inscription informing swagmen of the way to a well-known homestead where food rations were available. He claimed that the inscription read &quot;To Woombrah&quot;.

A man named Ardlaw Lawrence put forward his theory shortly after Enoggera Charlie. He suggested that the name was an Anglicised form of &quot;Boowoomga&quot;, which comes from the term for &quot;thunder&quot; in the dialect spoken by the Aboriginal tribe inhabiting areas along the Upper Burnett River (including the town of Gayndah). However, it is highly unlikely that this theory is correct, as this dialect was not spoken in the Darling Downs region (but rather in the Wide Bay-Burnett region) and Lawrence did not state why he transferred the name to the Darling Downs. In fact, the distance between Toowoomba and Gayndah is just over 218 kilometres as the crow flies.

In 1899, George Essex Evans published his theory in a pamphlet. He wrote that &quot;Toowoomba&quot; was an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;meeting of the waters&quot;, although no evidence was provided to support this claim.

==Geography==


Toowoomba is on the crest of the Great Dividing Range, around above sea level. A few streets lie on the eastern edge of the range, but the majority of the city is situated west of the divide.

The city is situated on the edge of the range and the low ridges behind it. Two valleys extend north from the southern boundary, originating from springs on either side of Middle Ridge near Spring Street, at an altitude of approximately . These waterways, East Creek and West Creek, converge just north of the CBD to form Gowrie Creek.

Gowrie Creek drains west across the Darling Downs and is a tributary of the Condamine River, part of the Murray–Darling basin. The water flowing down Gowrie Creek travels approximately to the mouth of the Murray River near Adelaide, South Australia. Rain falling on the easternmost streets of Toowoomba flows east to Moreton Bay, a distance of around .

The rich volcanic soil in the region helps maintain the 159 public parks that are scattered across the city. Jacaranda, camphor laurel and plane trees line many of the city streets. The city&#x27;s reputation as &#x27;The Garden City&#x27; is highlighted during the Australian Carnival of Flowers festival held in September each year. Deciduous trees from around the world line many of the parks, giving a display of autumn colour.

==History==
=== Traditional owners of the land ===
Giabal and Jarowair are recognised as the two main Aboriginal language groups of the Toowoomba with Giabal extending south of the city while Jarowair extends north of the city. The Jarowair (also known as Yarowair, Yarow-wair, Barrunggam, Yarrowair, Yarowwair and Yarrow-weir) language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Toowoomba Regional Council, particularly Toowoomba north to Crows Nest and west to Oakey.

This traditional landscape changed dramatically from 1840 with the incursion of British pastoralists into the region. Those Aboriginal Australians that survived the frontier conflict of this time were pushed to the fringe of society in camps and later moved to missions such as Deebing Creek, Durundur and later Barambah (now Cherbourg). Some local Aboriginal Australians worked on the properties around Toowoomba in this contact period. Ceremonies such as the Bonye Bonye festival remained active until the late 19th century – groups from south east and south west Queensland as well as northern New South Wales gathered at Gummingurru, near Gowrie (west of Toowoomba) prior to attending the festival. The Gummingurru site with its ancient stone circles is being restored by the Gummingurru Aboriginal Corporation and is an important ceremonial place for not only the traditional groups but neighbouring groups.

=== British exploration ===
Toowoomba&#x27;s colonial history traces back to when English botanist and explorer Allan Cunningham arrived in Australia from Brazil. He conducted an inland expedition north from the New England region and in June 1827 encountered of rich farming and grazing land, which he named as the Darling Downs, bordered on the east by the Great Dividing Range and west of the settlement of Moreton Bay.

=== British colonisation ===
In 1840, Patrick Leslie (second son of the ninth Laird of Warthill) and Peter Murphy established Toolburra Station south-west of Toowoomba, being the first British pastoralists to take land on the Downs. Later that same year, Eton College graduate, Arthur Hodgson, together with Gilbert Elliot and Cocky Rogers established &quot;Eton Vale&quot; on land which included &quot;The Swamp&quot;, now known as Toowoomba.

In forming Eton Vale, Hodgson&#x27;s brother Christopher Pemberton Hodgson, later described the &quot;constant skirmishes with the natives&quot; to wrest control of the area off the local Aboriginal people. He wrote that hundreds of Aborigines were killed in a bitter war that lasted three years from the time they arrived in the area. The interior of Eton Vale homestead was decorated with spears and boomerangs and other spoil which the Hodgsons had collected after hard fought battles with &quot;the blacks&quot;. Hodgson wrote &quot;who would not rather put a ball in their hearts to rid themselves of their ceremonials and presence at once?&quot;

The general mode of attack by the colonists would involve an early morning raid on the Aboriginal camps. The Hodgsons would &quot;generally employ our [black] boys from distant tribes to act as trackers&quot; to locate defiant groups of Aboriginal people. Sometimes a prisoner was taken and &quot;ordered to conduct us to his own camp on risk of his life&quot; and once at this camp, &quot;we rushed to attack it and we had, notwithstanding, ample revenge&quot;. Hodgson describes how Aborigines would try to recover &quot;the corpses of those who had fallen victims to the white man&#x27;s gun in defiance of a sentry on the lookout&quot;. Those who were at peace with the Hodgson brothers, were kept in line with methods such as the taking of young boys from the tribe as hostages. Hodgson claimed that if the local Aboriginal people were to be considered a species of &quot;simia acaudata&quot; or tail-less monkey, they had to be &quot;hunted down and exterminated&quot;.

=== Town of Toowoomba ===

Towards the end of the 1840s, closer settlement was occurring and the nearby township of Drayton had grown to the point where it had its own newspaper, general store, trading post and the Royal Bull&#x27;s Head Inn, which was built by William Horton and still stands today. The first Britishers began to live at &quot;The Swamp&quot; (Toowoomba) from 1849, where Josiah Dent, William Shuttleworth and William Gurney were employed to cut reeds and timber for use at Drayton. Dent was said to have &quot;lived in a tent, and with his axe, he killed the blacks&quot;.

In 1852, Thomas Alford established the first store at Toowoomba. Land for the town of Toowoomba at &quot;The Swamp&quot; was first surveyed in 1849, then again in 1853.By 1858 Toowoomba was growing fast. It had a population of 700, three hotels and many stores. Land selling at in 1850 was by then . Governor Bowen granted the wish of locals and a new municipality was proclaimed on 24 November 1860.

The first town council election took place on 4 January 1861 and William Henry Groom won. The railway from Ipswich was opened in 1867, bringing with it business development. In 1892, the Under Secretary of Public Land proclaimed Toowoomba and the surrounding areas as a township and in 1904 Toowoomba was declared a city. Pastoralism replaced agriculture and dairying by the 1900s.
In July 1902, 80 subdivided allotments of &quot;The Lilley Estate&quot; owned by the late Sir Charles Lilley, were advertised to be auctioned by Scholefield &amp; Godsall. A map advertising the auction shows that the estate was bordered by Bridge, Mary and Lindsay Streets and overlooking and adjoining the Royal Agricultural Society&#x27;s Showgrounds. 

In 1905, the Royal Agricultural Society and the Drayton and Toowoomba Agricultural and Horticultural Society merged and the Toowoomba Showgrounds on Campbell Street became the sole venue for the annual show.

The Rotary Club of Toowoomba was established in 1930.

During World War II, Toowoomba was the location of RAAF No.7 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot (IAFD), completed in 1942 and closed on 29 August 1944. Usually consisting of 4 tanks, 31 fuel depots were built across Australia for the storage and supply of aircraft fuel for the RAAF and the US Army Air Forces at a total cost of £900,000 ($1,800,000).

In 1985, the show left the Toowoomba Showgrounds for the new site in Glenvale.

Toowoomba was named as Australia&#x27;s Tidiest Town in 2008.

On 10 January 2011, Toowoomba suffered a catastrophic flash flood. Unusually heavy rainfall had occurred in the preceding days, causing the city&#x27;s waterways to become swollen. Around midday, an intense storm moved in from the northeast, completely overwhelming East Creek and West Creek which run through the CBD. fell in one day
with rainfall peaking at over one 10-minute interval. The flood caused damage to properties and infrastructure, and resulted in the deaths of 2 people in Toowoomba.

At the , the Urban Centre of Toowoomba recorded a population of 100,032 people. Of these:
* Age distribution: Residents had a similar distribution of ages to the country overall. The median age was 38 years, the same as the national median of 38 years. Children aged under 15 years made up 19.1% of the population (national average is 18.7%) and people aged 65 years and over made up 13.1% of the population (national average is 10.7%).
* Ethnic diversity : 79.1% were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 66.7%; the next most common countries of birth were England 1.9%, New Zealand 1.4%, India 1.2%, Philippines 0.8% and South Africa 0.6%. At home, 84.6% of residents only spoke English; the next most common languages spoken at home were Arabic 0.8%, Mandarin 0.8%, Dinka 0.4%, Tagalog 0.3% and Punjabi 0.3%.
* Finances: The median household weekly income was $1,206, compared to the national median of $1,438. This difference is also reflected in real estate, with the median mortgage payment being $1,517 per month, compared to the national median of $1,755.
* Housing: The majority (76.3%) of occupied private dwellings were separate houses, 16.1% were semi-detached (row or terrace houses, townhouses etc.), and 6.4% were flats, units or apartments. The average household size was 2.4 people.
* Transport: On the day of the Census, 0.8% of employed people travelled to work on public transport, and 77.9% by car (either as driver or as passenger).

==Climate==

Toowoomba has a temperate climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;) or otherwise known as a warm temperate climate with warm summers and cool winters. The city&#x27;s inland location as well as elevation and exposed location on the Great Dividing Range influence its climate in several notable ways: Toowoomba experiences more frequent high winds, hail, fog, low maximum temperatures and is even known to have the odd snowfall. As a result, the city has a reputation for being cooler than many other towns and cities in Queensland. Toowoomba is generally sunny, receiving 103.9 clear days annually on average, mostly in winter.

Daily maximum temperatures in Toowoomba average {{convert|28|C}} in summer and {{convert|17|C}} in winter. Unlike most of inland Queensland, summer temperatures above {{convert|33|C}} are uncommon, whilst winter days rarely above {{convert|23|C}}. Winter nights seldom drop below {{convert|0|C}}; however, in a situation somewhat unique among Queensland cities, snow has been reported on the higher parts of the city on several occasions; this is a trait it shares with the Granite Belt to the south along the Great Dividing Range. Light frost will be experienced several nights each winter in the city centre, more often in the western suburbs.
According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the highest temperature ever recorded in Toowoomba was {{convert|40.8|C}} on 12 February 2017, while the lowest was {{convert|-4.4|C}} on 12 July 1965.

Average annual rainfall is {{convert|735|mm|in|abbr=on}}, which peaks in the warm season. Rainfall in the eastern suburbs along the Great Dividing Range nudges {{convert|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year. The majority of Toowoomba&#x27;s rain falls from November to March, with January and February being the peak rainy months. Like most of south-east Queensland, severe thunderstorms can be a threat and Toowoomba may occasionally be affected by ex-tropical cyclones.

==Architecture and heritage==
{{main|List of sites on the Queensland Heritage Register in Toowoomba}}


Toowoomba&#x27;s history has been preserved in its buildings. Examples of architecture drawing from the city&#x27;s wealthy beginnings include Toowoomba City Hall which was Queensland&#x27;s first purpose-built town hall, the National Trust Royal Bull&#x27;s Head Inn and many examples in the heritage-listed Russell Street. Immediately to the east of the CBD is the Caledonian Estate, an area of turn-of-the-20th-century housing, ranging from humble workers cottages to large stately homes, in the classic wooden Queenslander style.

Toowoomba is also home to the Empire Theatre, which was originally opened in June 1911, as a silent movie house. In February 1933, fire broke out, almost completely destroying the building. However, the Empire was rebuilt and reopened in November 1933. The architectural styling of the new Empire Theatre was art deco, in keeping with the trend of the 1930s. After years of neglect, the Empire Theatre was extensively renovated in the late 1990s, but retains much of its art deco architecture and decorations, especially the proscenium arch. Able to seat approximately 1,500 people, the Empire Theatre is now the largest regional theatre in Australia.

The former Drayton railway station now functions as the DownSteam heritage railway and museum. Rollingstock includes the only surviving C16 Class, No. 106 &quot;Pride of Toowoomba&quot;, Built in 1914 and originally retired in Cairns by 1964.

The city also is home to the Cobb &amp; Co Museum, hailing to the famous mail company&#x27;s beginnings as a small mail run in the 1800s to transport mail and passengers to Brisbane and beyond. It also houses Australia&#x27;s largest collection of horse-drawn vehicles. The museum has undergone a A$8 million redevelopment before reopening in September 2010.

===Festivals===

Toowoomba is nationally renowned for the annual Carnival of Flowers, held each year in September. Many of the city&#x27;s major parks and gardens are especially prepared for the carnival, including an important home garden competition and parade of flower floats. Buses bring people from around the nation, and a popular way to arrive at the carnival from Brisbane is on chartered antique steam and diesel trains, which captures the yester-year aspect of travel to Toowoomba with 19th-century wooden carriages. The &quot;Food and Wine Festival&quot;, which usually spans 3 days, happens every year during the Carnival of flowers. It provides entertainment, food and drinks and is a well-known spectacle of the Carnival.

In 1953 the Carnival of Flowers was the subject of a sponsored film produced by the Queensland Minister for Lands and Irrigation. The &quot;Carnival of Flowers&quot; depicts the floral parade, the home gardens competition and the crowning of the Floral Queen and is a wonderful portrait of life in 1950s Queensland.

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Carnival of Flowers was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an &quot;Events and festivals&quot;.

The Toowoomba Carnival of Flowers received the Gold Award for Major Festival and Event at the Queensland Tourism Awards in 2015, 2016 &amp; 2017, and Australian Tourism Awards in 2016 &amp; 2017. In 2017, 255,639 people recorded as having attended the event.

Toowoomba also hosts &#x27;First Coat Art and Music Festival&#x27;. First Coat is a street art festival, held annually in May. As a result of the festival, over 50 pieces of large-scale, public art exist throughout the Toowoomba CBD, which has led to a transformation of previously underutilised lane and alleyways, as well as a reduction in costs associated with graffiti management.

Toowoomba was previously home to Easterfest, which was held annually over the Easter weekend but was discontinued after 2015 due to budgetary constraints. 

In March 2024, the innaugral Toowoomba Fashion Festival was held. It hosted three runways featuring emerging and established designers. The festival is an annual event aimed at reinvigorating the fashion industry in regional Australia.

===Food===
Toowoomba was home to the Weis Bar, famous for being the birthplace of the Weis brand, until 2021 when the parent company Unilever relocated production to a factory in Western Sydney and the bar was closed down.

==Infrastructure==

There is also the Toowoomba Hospice, a community-based private healthcare facility providing palliative care to the terminally ill.

===Water===
Toowoomba&#x27;s third water storage Cressbrook Dam was completed in 1983 and supplied water to Toowoomba in 1988. It has a full capacity of about {{convert|80000|Ml|e9cuft|abbr=off}} bringing total capacity of the three dams, Cooby, Perseverance, and Cressbrook, to {{convert|126000|Ml|e9cuft|abbr=off}}. The city also has underground supplies in fractured basalt of the rock unit known as the Main Range Volcanics. Toowoomba also sits above the eastern edge of the Great Artesian Basin and to the west underground water is available beneath unconsolidated alluvium.

Rainfall during the period from 1998 to 2005 was 30% below the long term average, consistent with a prolonged drought; with this trend continuing through to the spring of 2007. In mid-2005, the water situation for the city was becoming critical with water supply levels below 30%. Environmental flows from Cressbrook Dam into Cressbrook Creek were allowed to cease as Toowoomba approached level five water restrictions. During March 2006 the surface water storage in the dams fell below 25% of full capacity, falling further to 12.8% on 10 March 2008 and reaching an all-time low of 7.7% in December 2009.

The former Toowoomba Mayor Di Thorley proposed a controversial potable reuse project under the Toowoomba Water Futures plan which would result in water reclaimed from the Wetalla Sewage Treatment Plant being returned to Cooby Dam to provide 25% of the potable water supply for Toowoomba. Other water supply options include importing water from Oakey Creek Groundwater Management Area (average TDS 1660 mg/L), importing water from Condamine Groundwater Management Area (average TDS 740 mg/L), and water from coal seam gas production (TDS 1200–4300 mg/L).

On 29 July 2006, Toowoomba City Council conducted a poll of Toowoomba residents on the proposal to use this multi-barrier filtration system for filtering sewage for drinking purposes. The poll question was: &quot;Do you support the addition of purified recycled water to Toowoomba&#x27;s water supply via Cooby Dam as proposed by Water Futures – Toowoomba?&quot; 38% of voters supported the proposal and 62% opposed. This meant that despite dams reaching critical levels, the city rejected the use of recycled water in a plebiscite. Since the public rejection in 2006 of adding recycled sewage to the drinking water supply, water conservation measures have included harvesting stormwater for use in public parks and adding filtered groundwater to the town water supply. The city was under level 5 water restrictions as of 26 September 2006. This prohibits residents from using town water on their lawns, gardens or cars, and residents are strongly urged to cut down on water consumption.

In 2007, the Toowoomba City Council commenced a bore drilling program to augment the dwindling dam supplies and constructed several subartesian bores across the city and one artesian bore at Wetalla in the city&#x27;s north. Many of the subartesian bores provided potable water with a reliable yield and have been developed into production however the artesian bore&#x27;s water quality was very poor, prohibiting development as a potable source. This was an expensive setback for the city as the cost was over A$2 million for drilling to over {{cvt|700|m}}. In January 2008, yield testing had been stalled due to the unavailability of appropriate pumping equipment. The Toowoomba Regional Council began supplementing the city&#x27;s water supply with bore water from the Great Artesian Basin in September 2009. Groundwater has become a significant contributor to the city&#x27;s water supply needs and now constitutes one third of the total volume of water treated for reticulated supply ({{convert|160|Ml|cuft}} per week).

The state government has built a $187 million pipeline from Wivenhoe Dam to Toowoomba. Water pumping along the {{cvt|38|km|mi|abbr=on}} pipeline to Cressbrook Dam began in January 2010.

<text>The fork-tailed drongo (Dicrurus adsimilis), also called the common drongo or African drongo, is a small bird found from the Sahel to South Africa that lives in wooded habitats, particularly woodlands and savannas. It is part of the family Dicruridae and has four recognized subspecies, &quot;D. a adsimilis&quot;, &quot;D. a. apivorus&quot;, &quot;D. a. fugax&quot; and &quot;D. a. jubaensis&quot;. Like other drongos, the fork-tailed is mostly insectivorous; its diet mainly consists of butterflies, termites, and grasshoppers.

Physically, this species is characterized with a narrow fork-shaped tail, red-brownish eyes, and black plumage throughout all of its body. These birds nest close to wetlands, forests, and farms and the breeding season varies depending the region. The female usually lays one to four eggs, which hatch in 15 to 18 days.

The fork-tailed drongo is known for its ability to deceptively mimic other bird alarm calls in order for a certain animal to flee the scene so it can steal their food (kleptoparasitism). They are also known for their aggressive and fearless behavior, often attacking and driving away much larger animals, including birds of prey, when their nest is in danger. Due to its extensive range and stable population, the fork-tailed drongo is classified by the IUCN Red List as a least-concern species.

== Taxonomy ==
The fork-tailed drongo was described by Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1794. Its populations are genetically distinct, and four races are usually accepted, though as of 2023, &quot;D. a. divaricatus&quot; and &quot;D. a. lugubris&quot; are included within the taxon by the IOC. The races &quot;D. a. modestus,&quot; together with &quot;D. a. coracinus&quot; and &quot;D. a. atactus&quot; are usually split as a separate species, the velvet-mantled drongo, &quot;D. modestus&quot; (Hartlaub, 1849).

::Range: Southwestern Chad east to Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia, south to northern Democratic Republic of the Congo, northern Uganda, and northern Kenya.

==Distribution and habitat==
The fork-tailed drongo is a common and widespread resident breeder in Africa south of the Sahara. This insect-eating bird is usually found in open woodland, savanna and forest edge and is tolerant of arid climates. Its range was formerly considered to include Asia, but the Asian species is now called the black drongo (&quot;D. macrocercus&quot;). The bird can be found at heights as high as 2200 meters.

==Description==
The bird possesses a robust black beak and red eyes. When born, they lack feathers, exhibiting reddish skin, an orange beak, yellow gape flange, brown eyes, and a black beak. Juvenile fork-tailed drongos are dark brown tone with some buff-colored feather tips, a less pronounced tail fork, brown or grey eyes, and a pale mouth. While resembling adults, they lack the glossy shine on the lower body and display pale feathers on certain areas. Both sexes share a black body with a blue-green iridescence in specific regions. The underside, including the belly, is uniformly black, contrasting with the glossy black-blue upper body. Their lengthy tail is deeply forked and black, measuring approximately 115–126 mm in length and 19–23 mm in depth. They feature short legs and a wingspan of 134 mm. Their bill is characterized by a depth of 0.4 mm and a length of 2.8 mm.

Following breeding, adult birds experience a complete molt, usually taking place between December and March in Southern Africa, with varying months in other areas. Young birds maintain their immature plumage until the next breeding season. The partial post-juvenile molt initiates prior to the growth of new wing and tail feathers following the nesting period. Instances of leucism have been observed in the fork-tailed drongo.

=== Vocalizations ===
This bird is notably vocal, often commencing the dawn chorus and often is the last heard at dusk. Their pre-dawn calls comprise variations such as &quot;jwaaa-jwaaa&quot; and &quot;jeewy-jeeerr&quot;. They exhibit a diverse repertoire of vocalizations, ranging from sharp calls, brief whistles, and squeaks to fluid, raspy, and scratchy notes delivered rapidly or with extended pauses. Their repertoire includes calls like &quot;chyup&quot;, &quot;tjaaa&quot;, the resounding &quot;jer-woo&quot;, and the whistled &quot;jee-lu&quot;. Mated pairs participate in coordinated duets lasting 4–5 minutes. Their songs feature soft, high-pitched, nasal, or melodious whistles, chirps, grinding sounds, and liquid chattering.

These birds produce specific drongo calls and mimic other bird species such as bocage&#x27;s bushshrike, thrushes, tchagras, bulbuls, birds of prey and owls. They have also been observed imitating the mewings of cats and the alarm calls of meerkats.

== Behavior ==
===Feeding===

This species is mostly insectivorous and occasionally eats fishes and other birds, furthermore they may take nectar and eat plants when available too. Predominant preyed animals are butterflies, beetles, caterpillars, grasshoppers, honey bees, moths, termites and weevils, especially common species being the angola white lady, &quot;macrotermes natalensis&quot;, &quot;cyrtacanthacris aeruginosa&quot;, and the desert locust. Sometimes they might also eat small fishes by swooping down from a perch hovering over water and dipping, it has been observed small birds being captured with their claws or bills, namely the bronze mannikin. Plants take around 15% of their diet, usually eaten are the &quot;moringa oleifera&quot;, &quot;azadirachta indica&quot; and the &quot;dialium guineense&quot;. This bird is solitary in its hunting. This species spends about 62% of the day feeding during the dry season, and 56% of the day during rainy seasons.

Typically, the fork-tailed drongo perches at a height ranging from to , adopting an erect posture from which they swiftly pursue insects by flycatching, plunge diving, or seizing them on the ground before returning to the same branch. This species is capable of holding large items with their claws and rending them with their bills. They frequently inhabit savanna fires, where they capture fleeing insects and other prey seeking refuge from the flames. These birds maintain a commensalist relationship with large mammals, trailing animals such as elephants and giraffes that disturb insects in the vicinity, thereby flushing out potential prey.

=== Kleptoparasitism ===

A tactic employed by the fork-tailed drongo to acquire food is an opportunistic kleptoparasitism. The drongo will give genuine alarm calls to signal the presence of predators to other animals, but occasionally, it will issue a false alarm call to displace those animals and steal their food. These birds may also engage in direct attacks on other species or do so after a failed false alarm attempt.

It has been observed that fork-tailed drongos spend approximately 29% of their time trailing other animals. Species such as southern pied babblers, sociable weavers, wattled starlings and meerkats, which forage on the ground, are often targeted by fork-tailed&#x27;s kleptoparasitism. This behavior arises because drongos lack the necessary morphological adaptations to effectively hunt certain prey that are more nutritious and calorific, hence resorting to kleptoparasitism. These birds frequently assume leadership roles in mixed-species foraging flocks, serving as sentinels alongside other species. This cooperative strategy reduces the risk of predation and enhances the foraging success of the associated species. Simultaneously, the drongo exploits these associations to increase opportunities for kleptoparasitism.

Although in doubt, researchers have considered the possibility that these drongos possess a theory of mind, a trait not fully demonstrated in any animal other than humans. This is attributed to the birds&#x27; adaptability in response to feedback. They may vary their tactics by occasionally emitting either genuine or deceptive alarm calls. Approximately a quarter of their food intake is estimated to result from kleptoparasitism, with an additional 10% acquired by capturing prey flushed by associated species. Furthermore, the prey caught using this strategy are typically larger than those acquired through self-foraging. After emitting a deceptive call, the drongo will follow up with an &#x27;all clear&#x27; signal, to minimize the disruption to the foraging activities of other animals and increases the frequency of genuine alarm calls in order to gain the trust back.

A study has cast doubt on the widespread assumption that the fork-tailed drongo relies heavily on its kleptoparasitic tactics. Instead, these birds may deploy such strategies primarily in times of food scarcity, such as during droughts and on cold days. Even though the biomass intake when doing kleptoparasitism is higher, it also poses risks as a foraging tactic and may result in additional foraging costs compared to self-foraging.

=== Breeding ===

During the breeding season, these birds often nest close to wetlands, forests, and farms, benefiting from the favorable nesting sites and materials provided by the microhabitat and vegetation. They exhibit monogamous behavior and are known for their aggressiveness towards other drongos, as well as nest predators like crows, birds of prey, hornbills, shrikes, small mammals, and large snakes. Partners perch together, performing duets, and displaying behaviors such as tilting and nodding their heads. Brood parasitism on groundscraper thrush have been observed.

The breeding season typically extends from March to September north of the equator and from September to January south of it. The timing of the egg-laying season varies significantly between regions. The number of broods ranges from one to four, and if a clutch is lost early in the season, they may replace it. Nests are usually positioned 2.2 to 17 meters above the ground, constructed between horizontal branches, and feature saucer-shaped structures crafted from plant stems, lichens, small roots, tendrils, and cobwebs. Eggs are laid at intervals of 24 to 48 hours. Incubation, lasting 15 to 18 days, begins only after the clutch is complete. Both male and female birds feed the chicks, providing flies, beetle larvae, lizards, and seeds. The nestling period typically spans from 16 to 22 days.

Drongos are frequently utilized as brood hosts by African cuckoos (21.8% of nests), and in the Kalahari Desert, it has been discovered that Jacobin cuckoos also parasitize drongo nests. Drongo eggs display a diverse array of colors and patterns, which the cuckoos mimic. Experiments indicate that drongos can detect and reject 93.7% of introduced eggs.

==Conservation status==
Due to their very large range, stable population trend and size, the fork-tailed drongo is considered to be a least-concern species by the IUCN Red List, though the subspecies &quot;D. a. modestus,&quot; previously considered a separated species, was considered a near-threatened. The fork-tailed drongo faces threats from pesticide use, which diminishes their prey availability, and habitat destruction due to farmland expansion. However, the species is unlikely to be threatened in the near future as it benefits from tree clearance in dense forests.

<doc id="463333" wikidata="Q5326360" url="?curid=463333" title="Earl of Powis">
<text>Earl of Powis (Powys) is a title that has been created three times. The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1674 in favour of William Herbert, 3rd Baron Powis, a descendant of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (c. 1501–1570). In 1687, he was further honoured when he was made (and as detailed at the article of) Marquess of Powis.

The title was created again in 1748 in the Peerage of Great Britain for Henry Arthur Herbert, the husband of Barbara, daughter of Lord Edward Herbert, brother of William, 3rd Marquess of Powis. He notably represented Bletchingley and Ludlow in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire and Shropshire. Herbert had already been created Baron Herbert of Chirbury in 1743 and was made Baron Powis and Viscount Ludlow at the same time he was given the earldom. In 1749 he was also created Baron Herbert of Chirbury and Ludlow, with remainder firstly to his brother Richard Herbert and secondly to his kinsman Francis Herbert, of Ludlow. His son, the second Earl, was also Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire and Shropshire. However, on his death in 1801 all the titles became extinct (the persons in remainder to the 1749 barony had died without heirs before the 2nd Earl).

The title was created for the third time in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1804 when Edward Clive, 2nd Baron Clive (being son-in-law of the 1st Earl of the previous creation), was made Earl of Powis, in the County of Montgomeryshire. He had previously represented Ludlow in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire and Montgomeryshire. Clive was the husband of Lady Henrietta, daughter of the 1st Earl of Powis of the 1748 creation and sister and heiress of the 2nd Earl. He had already been created Baron Clive, of Walcot in the County of Shropshire, in 1794, in the Peerage of Great Britain, and was made Baron Powis, of Powis Castle in the County of Montgomery, Baron Herbert, of Chirbury in the County of Shropshire, and Viscount Clive, of Ludlow in the County of Shropshire, at the same time he was given the earldom. Clive was the son of the famous soldier Robert Clive, who had been raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Clive of Plassey in the County of Clare, in 1762. Known as &quot;Clive of India&quot;, he is regarded as a key figure in the establishment of British India.

The 1st Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, the 2nd Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Ludlow and served as Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire. In 1807, Lord Powis assumed by Royal licence the surname and arms of Herbert. His son, the 3rd Earl, represented Shropshire North in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire. He was succeeded by his nephew, the 4th Earl. He was the son of Lieutenant-General The Rt Hon. Sir Percy Egerton Herbert, second son of the 2nd Earl. Lord Powis was Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire. In 1890, he married Violet Ida Evelyn Herbert (who later became, in 1903, the 16th Baroness Darcy de Knayth, &quot;suo jure&quot;). Their eldest son Percy Robert Herbert, Viscount Clive, died of wounds received fighting in the Battle of the Somme; their second son Mervyn Horatio Herbert, Viscount Clive, succeeded his mother in the barony on her death in 1929. However, he too predeceased his father and was succeeded in the barony by his daughter Davina as the &quot;suo jure&quot; 18th Baroness Darcy de Knayth.

Lord Powis was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the 5th Earl. He was the son of the Hon. Colonel Edward William Herbert, son of the Hon. Robert Charles Herbert, fourth son of the second Earl. On his death the titles passed to his younger brother, the 6th Earl. He was succeeded by his second cousin, the 7th Earl. He was the son of the Right Reverend Percy Mark Herbert, Bishop of Blackburn and of Norwich, son of Major-General the Hon. William Henry Herbert, fifth son of the second Earl. the peerages are held by his son, the 8th Earl, who succeeded in 1993. Lord Powis is also Lord of the Manor of Clun.

The Hon. Robert Henry Clive, second son of the 1st Earl, married Harriett Windsor (later Baroness Windsor), in 1819. Their grandson Robert Windsor-Clive, 14th Baron Windsor, was created Earl of Plymouth in 1905. Consequently, the present holder of the earldom of Plymouth is also in remainder to the earldom of Powis and its subsidiary titles. George Windsor-Clive, second son of the Hon. Robert Henry Clive and Lady Windsor, was Member of Parliament for Ludlow for many years.
Another branch of the Clive family was founded by Reverend Benjamin Clive, uncle of the 1st Baron Clive. Members of this branch include George Clive, Edward Clive, George Clive, Edward Clive, Sir Sidney Clive and Sir Robert Clive.

The actor Colin Clive, known for starring in the iconic 1931 horror film &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, was also a member of the family, descending from the 1st Baron Clive. Colin Clive appeared in the 1935 biopic film about the life of his ancestor, &quot;Clive of India&quot;.

The family seat is Powis Castle, near Welshpool, Montgomeryshire, Wales.

<doc id="463334" wikidata="Q1156052" url="?curid=463334" title="DVD+RW Alliance">
<text>The DVD+RW Alliance is a group of electronic hardware, optical storage and software manufacturers who in 1997 created and promoted a format standard of recordable and rewritable DVDs, known as the &quot;plus&quot; format. As of 2004, plus format DVDs were available in three forms: DVD+R, DVD+RW, and DVD+R DL. In late 2005 DVD+RW DL was developed but never produced commercially.

==Mission==

The Alliance seeks to develop and promote a format of rewritable DVDs that is universally compatible with both DVD drives in personal computers (PCs) and standalone consumer products (i.e. DVD players and DVD recorders) to allow a greater convergence in function between the two.

==Working groups==

The Alliance has two major working groups. The DVD+RW Product Promotions Group is responsible for the promotion work of the Alliance for the plus format and plus format products. The DVD+RW Compatibility and Convergence Group is responsible for working on the technical issues involved in the compatibility between the various hardware products using the plus format.

==Leading members==

Eight companies form the leadership of the Alliance:

* Dell Computer Corp.
* HP (Hewlett-Packard Co.)
* Mitsubishi Chemical Corp.
* Royal Philips Electronics N.V.
* Ricoh Company, Ltd.
* Sony Corp.
* Thomson SA (RCA)
* Yamaha Corp.

The above-mentioned companies are only the leadership of the alliance and don&#x27;t form the whole alliance itself.

==Rival formats==

Competing standards developed by the rival DVD Forum are for the &quot;dash&quot; formats (DVD-R, DVD-RW, and DVD-RAM). Alliance leaders Philips, Sony and Thomson were also founding members of the DVD Forum, established in 1995. , both plus and dash formats seem equally popular with customers, and both are compatible with the vast majority of DVD players.

<doc id="463336" wikidata="Q460791" url="?curid=463336" title="Thomas Wright (astronomer)">
<text>Thomas Wright (22 September 171125 February 1786) was an English astronomer, mathematician, instrument maker, architect and garden designer. He was the first to describe the shape of the Milky Way and to speculate that faint nebulæ were distant galaxies.

==Early life==
Wright was born at Byers Green in County Durham, being the third son of John and Margaret Wright of Pegg&#x27;s Poole House. His father was a carpenter. He was educated at home as he suffered from speech impediment, and then at King James I Academy. In 1725 he entered into a clock-making apprenticeship to Bryan Stobart of Bishop Auckland, continuing to study on his own. He also took courses on mathematics and navigation at a free school in the parish of Gateshead founded by Dr Theophilus Pickering. Then he went to London to study mathematical instrument-making with Heath and Sisson, and made a trial sea voyage to Amsterdam.

In 1730, he set up a school in Sunderland, where he taught mathematics and navigation. He later moved back to London to work on a number of projects for his wealthy patrons. He travelled in 1746-7 to Ireland which resulted in a book, &quot;Louthiana&quot;, with plans and engravings of the ancient monuments of County Louth, published in London in 1748. That was before he retired to County Durham and built a small observatory at Westerton.

==Astronomy==
Wright&#x27;s publication &quot;An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe&quot; (1750) explained the appearance of the Milky Way as &quot;an optical effect due to our immersion in what locally approximates to a flat layer of stars.&quot; This work influenced Immanuel Kant in writing his &quot;Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens&quot; (1755). The theory was later empirically advanced by William Herschel in 1785, leading to galactocentrism (a form of heliocentrism, with the Sun at the centre of the Milky Way). Another of Wright&#x27;s ideas, which is also often attributed to Kant, was that many faint nebulæ are actually incredibly distant galaxies. Wright wrote:
Kant termed these &quot;island universes.&quot; However &quot;scientific arguments were marshalled against such a possibility,&quot; and this view was rejected by almost all scientists until 1924, when Edwin Hubble showed &quot;spiral nebulæ&quot; were distant galaxies by measuring Cepheids.

In his letters, Wright emphasised the possible enormity of the universe, and the tranquility of eternity:
==Garden design==
Wright has been credited with work for William Capel, 3rd Earl of Essex at Cassiobury Park in Watford, illustrating his designs in &quot;A Walk in Cassiobury Gardens&quot; and &quot;Views of Cassiobury&quot;. In &quot;Grotesque Architecture&quot; of 1767 there is a design for a rockwork bridge to decorate &quot;the fine piece of water&quot; he had &quot;with great pleasure seen... at Cassiobury&quot;, believed to be by Wright. A man of talents, he also gave the Earl&#x27;s daughters mathematical instruction. Another patron was the Earl of Halifax, at Horton House.

In the 1750s, he laid out the grounds of Netheravon House, Wiltshire and after 1753, completed the design and construction of Horton Hall in Northamptonshire and gardens. He designed in 1769 the folly or eye-catcher known as Codger Fort at Rothley, Northumberland, on the Wallington Hall estate.

One of the largest existing examples of Wright&#x27;s work is the Stoke Park Estate. The estate was remodelled by Wright between 1748 and 1766.

== Death ==
Wright died in 1786 in Byers Green and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew&#x27;s, South Church, Bishop Auckland. He was survived by his illegitimate daughter.

<doc id="463338" wikidata="Q1277131" url="?curid=463338" title="Earl Nelson">
<text>Earl Nelson, &quot;of Trafalgar and of Merton in the County of Surrey&quot;, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 20 November 1805 for the Rev. William Nelson, 2nd Baron Nelson, one month after the death of his younger brother Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson, the famous naval hero of the Napoleonic Wars and victor of the Battle of Trafalgar of 21 October 1805 (during which he was killed in action). The title is extant, the present holder being Simon Nelson, 10th Earl Nelson, who has an heir apparent. The family seat of Trafalgar House in Wiltshire (also known as Standlynch Park) was sold in 1948 by Edward Nelson, 5th Earl Nelson.

==History==
The title was created on 20 November 1805 for the Reverend William Nelson, 2nd Baron Nelson, who was a son of the Reverend Edmund Nelson (1722–1802) and an elder brother of Horatio Nelson. The Nelson family had been settled in Norfolk for many generations, and the Reverend Edmund Nelson was Rector of Hillborough and of Burnham Thorpe in that county. He married Catherine Suckling, whose maternal grandmother Mary was the sister of both the 1st Earl of Orford and the 1st Baron Walpole of Wolterton. Their fifth but third-surviving son was the renowned naval commander Horatio Nelson.

After defeating the French at the Battle of the Nile in 1798, Horatio Nelson was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain on 6 November 1798 as Baron Nelson, of the Nile, and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. In 1799, he was created Duke of Bronte (Italian: &quot;Duca di Bronte&quot;), of the Kingdom of Sicily, by King Ferdinand III of Sicily, which title he was given royal sanction to use in Britain.

After defeating the Danish fleet at the Battle of Copenhagen in April 1801, Nelson was further honoured when he was made Viscount Nelson, of the Nile, and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body, on 22 May 1801. On 18 August of the same year, he was created Baron Nelson, of the Nile, and of Hillborough in the County of Norfolk, with remainder, in default of male issue of his own, to his father and the heirs male of his body, and failing them to the heirs male of the body severally and successively of his sisters Susannah Bolton and Catherine Matcham. Both titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

Nelson was killed at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805. Since he had no legitimate children, the barony of 1798 and the viscountcy became extinct upon his death.

He was succeeded in the barony of 1801 according to the special remainder (and also in the dukedom of Bronte) by his elder brother the Reverend William Nelson, who became the second Baron. On 20 November 1805, the second Baron was created Viscount Merton, of Trafalgar and of Merton in the County of Surrey, and Earl Nelson, of Trafalgar and of Merton in the County of Surrey, in honour of his late brother and with similar remainder to the barony of 1801. Both titles are in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The first Earl died without surviving male issue and was succeeded in the dukedom of Bronte by his daughter Charlotte, wife of the 2nd Baron Bridport.

The first Earl was succeeded in the British titles (according to the special remainders) by his nephew Thomas Bolton, the second Earl. He was the eldest son of the aforementioned Susannah Bolton, a sister of the first Earl and the wife of Thomas Bolton of Wells in Norfolk. The second Earl assumed the surname of Nelson upon succeeding to the peerages. He only held the titles for eight months and on his early death, the titles passed to his eldest son, the third Earl. He was succeeded by his third but eldest surviving son, the fourth Earl. He never married and on his death in 1947, the titles passed to his eighty-seven-year-old younger brother, the fifth Earl. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the sixth Earl, who was a lecturer in astronomy and anthropology. Two of his younger brothers, the seventh and eighth Earls, both succeeded in the titles.

, the peerages are held by Simon John Horatio Nelson, 10th Earl Nelson (born 1971), a great-grandson of the fifth Earl. He succeeded in 2009 and is the eldest son of Peter John Horatio Nelson, the ninth Earl.

Two other members of the family also had distinguished naval careers. The Hon. Maurice Horatio Nelson (1832–1914), third son of the second Earl, was a rear-admiral in the Royal Navy. His eldest son, Maurice Henry Horatio Nelson (1864–1942), was a captain in the Royal Navy.

==Coat of arms==
Arms were granted to Admiral Horatio Nelson and confirmed on 20 October 1797. Nelson&#x27;s paternal arms (&quot;Or, a cross flory sable over all a bendlet gules&quot;) were augmented to honour his naval victories. After the Battle of Cape St Vincent (14 February 1797), Nelson was created a Knight of the Bath and was granted heraldic supporters (appropriate for peers) of a sailor and a lion.

In honour of the Battle of the Nile in 1798, the Crown granted him an augmentation of honour blazoned &quot;On a chief wavy argent a palm tree between a disabled ship and a ruinous battery all issuant from waves of the sea all proper&quot;, the Latin motto &quot;Palmam qui meruit ferat&quot; (&quot;let him who has earned it bear the palm&quot;), and added to his supporters a palm branch in the hand of the sailor and in the paw of the lion, and a &quot;tri-colored flag and staff in the mouth of the latter&quot;.

<doc id="463340" wikidata="Q1291549" url="?curid=463340" title="Henk Rogers">
<text>Henk Rogers is an Indonesian-Dutch video game designer and entrepreneur. He is known for producing Japan&#x27;s first major turn-based role-playing video game &quot;The Black Onyx&quot;, securing the rights to distribute the Russian puzzle video game &quot;Tetris&quot; on video game consoles where the game found popularity, and as the founder of Bullet-Proof Software (later called Blue Planet Software) and The Tetris Company, which licenses the &quot;Tetris&quot; trademark. He was instrumental in resolving licensing disputes that brought &quot;Tetris&quot; to the Game Boy. Today, he is managing director of The Tetris Company.

==Early life==
In 1972 Henk Rogers graduated from Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. He later relocated to Hawaii, where he pursued studies in Computer Science at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.

While studying at the University, Henk met his future wife, Akemi. He followed her to Japan, her home country, and after three extended visits, they married in 1977 and settled down there; they lived in the family compound owned by his father-in-law. Henk was involved with his family business at the time. They have four children together.

==Career==
During the 1980s, as the founder and CEO of Bullet-Proof Software, Rogers developed an interest in &quot;Tetris&quot;, a game designed by Alexey Pajitnov that was gaining popularity in Europe. Rogers perceived the game as having enormous global market potential and decided to acquire its rights. To achieve this, he negotiated a deal with Nintendo to secure the rights for their upcoming Game Boy system, and then made a trip to the Soviet Union to deal with Elektronorgtechnica, a software development company. During his meeting with ELORG&#x27;s management, he managed to convince them about Tetris&#x27; prospects in the global market, resulting in a successful deal.

The deal with Elorg granted Rogers international rights to &quot;Tetris&quot; for home gaming systems. From there, he promoted the game, which ultimately became a global hit, primarily due to its release on Nintendo&#x27;s handheld gaming system, the Game Boy. This success led to the establishment of The Tetris Company, co-founded by Rogers and Pajitnov.

Beyond &quot;Tetris&quot; and other video game endeavors, Rogers has founded or cofounded several community and sustainability-oriented organizations and companies.

The first of these was Blue Planet Foundation, a 501(c)(3) public charity focused on activities of advocacy, which Rogers founded in 2007 to build awareness and fostering action for clean energy in Hawaii. In 2015, the foundation led the campaign to make Hawaii the first state in the United States of America with a 100% renewable energy law.

Following this, Rogers joined his daughter Maya Rogers and local angel investor Chenoa Farnsworth to launch Blue Startups, a Honolulu-based startup accelerator to mentor, invest in, and encourage the founding of technology startups, particularly ones servicing the cross-Pacific region and/or several targeted interest areas.

In 2015, Rogers then founded Blue Planet Energy, a energy storage systems (i.e., batteries) provider. Blue Planet Energy&#x27;s lithium-ion batteries use a lithium ferrous phosphate (LFP) chemistry instead of nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) chemistry. Rogers believes LFP to be more environmentally friendly because the batteries are noncombustible and do not require rare earth elements.

Rogers is also chairman of the Pacific International Space Center for Exploration Systems (PISCES) and founder of the International MoonBase Alliance, which developed the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS), a 1,200 square-foot Mars and moon analog habitat on Mauna Loa. PISCES&#x27; core mission is to develop and grow an aerospace industry in Hawaii through applied research, workforce development and economic development initiatives.

==In media==
Rogers is portrayed by Welsh actor Taron Egerton in the 2023 film &quot;Tetris&quot;.

<doc id="463349" wikidata="Q3301793" url="?curid=463349" title="Hydrocele testis">
<text>A hydrocele testis is an accumulation of clear fluid within the cavum vaginale, the potential space between the layers of the tunica vaginalis of the testicle. It is the most common form of hydrocele and is often referred to simply as a &quot;hydrocele&quot;. A primary hydrocele testis causes a painless enlargement in the scrotum on the affected side and is thought to be due to the defective absorption of fluid secreted between the two layers of the tunica vaginalis (investing membrane). A secondary hydrocele is secondary to either inflammation or a neoplasm in the testis.

A hydrocele testis usually occurs on one side, but can also affect both sides. The accumulation can be a marker of physical trauma, infection, tumor or varicocele surgery, but the cause is generally unknown. Indirect inguinal hernia indicates an increased risk of hydrocele testis.

==Signs and symptoms==

A hydrocele testis feels like a small fluid-filled balloon inside the scrotum. It is smooth and is mainly in front of the testis. Hydrocele testes vary greatly in size and are typically painless and harmless. However, as the fluid continues to accumulate and the scrotum further enlarges, more discomfort can be expected. Large hydroceles will cause discomfort because of their size. Sometimes pain can be in both testicles as pressure from the enlarged area puts pressure against the unaffected area which can cause discomfort to the normal testicle. It has also been found to decrease a man&#x27;s sex drive and make him less active for fear of enlarging the mass. As the fluid of a hydrocele testis is transparent, light shone through the hydrocelic region will be visible from the other side. This phenomenon is called transillumination.

Symptoms of a hydrocele testis can easily be distinguished from testicular cancer, as a hydrocele is soft and fluid-filled, whereas testicular cancer feels hard and rough.

===Fertility===
A hydrocele testis is not generally thought to affect fertility. However, it may be indicative of other factors that may affect fertility.

==Cause==
During embryogenesis, the testis descends through the inguinal canal, drawing a diverticulum of peritoneum into the scrotum as it descends. This peritoneal tissue is known as the processus vaginalis. Normally, the communication between the processus vaginalis and the peritoneum is obliterated, and the tunica vaginalis is the tissue that remains overlying the testis and the epididymis. Congenital hydrocele testis results when the processus vaginalis remains, allowing fluid from the peritoneum to accumulate in the scrotum.

==Diagnosis==
Through diagnostic ultrasound the accumulation of fluids can be diagnosed correctly.

==Treatment==
The fluid accumulation can be drained by aspiration, but this may be only temporary. A more permanent alternative is a surgical procedure, generally, an outpatient ambulatory (same-day) procedure, called a hydrocelectomy. There are two surgical techniques available for hydrocelectomy.

; Hydrocelectomy with Excision of the Hydrocele Sac: Incision of the hydrocele sac after complete mobilization of the hydrocele. Partial resection of the hydrocele sac, leaving a margin of 1–2 cm. Care is taken not to injure testicular vessels, epididymis, or ductus deferens. The edge of the hydrocele sac is oversewn for hemostasis (von Bergmann&#x27;s technique) or the edges are sewn together behind the spermatic cord (Winkelmann&#x27;s or Jaboulay&#x27;s technique). Hydrocele surgery with excision of the hydrocele sac is useful for large or thick-walled hydroceles and multilocular hydroceles.
; Hydrocele Surgery with Plication of the Hydrocele Sac: The hydrocele is opened with a small skin incision without further preparation. The hydrocele sac is reduced (plicated) by suture Hydrocele surgery: Lord&#x27;s technique. The plication technique is suitable for medium-sized and thin-walled hydroceles. The advantage of the plication technique is the minimized dissection with a reduced complication rate.

If the hydrocele is not surgically removed, it may continue to grow. The hydrocele fluid can be aspirated. This procedure can be done in a urologist&#x27;s office or clinic and is less invasive, but recurrence rates are high. Sclerotherapy, the injection of a solution following aspiration of the hydrocele fluid may increase success rates. In many patients, the procedure of aspiration and sclerotherapy is repeated as the hydrocele recurs.

<doc id="463350" wikidata="Q324986" url="?curid=463350" title="Chikamatsu Monzaemon">
<text>was a Japanese dramatist of jōruri, the form of puppet theater that later came to be known as bunraku, and the live-actor drama, kabuki. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; has written that he is &quot;widely regarded as the greatest Japanese dramatist&quot;. His most famous plays deal with double-suicides of honor bound lovers. Of his puppet plays, around 70 are &quot;jidaimono&quot; (時代物) (historical romances) and 24 are &quot;sewamono&quot; (世話物) (domestic tragedies). The domestic plays are today considered the core of his artistic achievement, particularly works such as &quot;The Courier for Hell&quot; (1711) and &quot;The Love Suicides at Amijima&quot; (1721). His histories are viewed less positively, though &quot;The Battles of Coxinga&quot; (1715) remains praised.

==Biography==
Chikamatsu was born Sugimori Nobumori to a samurai family. There is disagreement about his birthplace. The most popular theory suggests he was born in Echizen Province, but there are other plausible locations, including Hagi, Nagato Province. His father, Sugimori Nobuyoshi, served the &quot;daimyō&quot; Matsudaira in Echizen as a medical doctor. Chikamatsu&#x27;s younger brother became a medical doctor, and Chikamatsu himself wrote a book on health care.
In those days, doctors who served the &quot;daimyōs&quot; held samurai status. But Chikamatsu&#x27;s father lost his office and became a &quot;rōnin&quot;, a masterless samurai. At some point in his teens, between 1664 and 1670, Chikamatsu moved to imperial capital Kyoto with his father where he served for a few years as an obscure page for a civil noble family, but other than that, little is known about this period of Chikamatsu&#x27;s life. He published his first known literary work in this period, a haiku that appeared in 1671. After serving as a page, he next appears in records of the Gonshō-ji (近松寺) temple (long suggested as the origin of his pen name &quot;Chikamatsu&quot;, which is kun reading of 近松) in Ōmi Province, in present-day Shiga Prefecture.

With the production in 1683 of his puppet play in Kyoto about the Soga brothers (&quot;The Soga Successors&quot; or &quot;The Soga Heir&quot;; &quot;Yotsugi Soga&quot;), Chikamatsu became known as a playwright. &quot;The Soga Successors&quot; is believed to have been Chikamatsu&#x27;s first play although sometimes 15 earlier anonymous plays are contended to have been by Chikamatsu as well. Chikamatsu also wrote plays for the kabuki theatre between 1684 and 1695, most of which were intended to be performed by a famous actor of the day, Sakata Tōjūrō (1647–1709). After 1695, and until 1705, Chikamatsu wrote almost exclusively Kabuki plays, and then he abruptly almost completely abandoned that genre. The exact reason is unknown, although speculation is rife: perhaps the puppets were more biddable and controllable than the ambitious kabuki actors, or perhaps Chikamatsu did not feel kabuki worth writing for since Tōjūrō was about to retire, or perhaps the growing popularity of the puppet theater was economically irresistible. C. Andrew Gerstle argues that Chikamatsu&#x27;s collaborations with various performers affected his development as a playwright. His collaborations with kabuki practitioners led to more realistic characters, while his later collaboration with Takeda Izumo led to a heightened theatricality.

In 1705, Chikamatsu became a &quot;Staff Playwright&quot; as announced by early editions of &quot;The Mirror of Craftsmen of the Emperor Yōmei&quot;. In 1705 or 1706, Chikamatsu left Kyoto for Osaka, where the puppet theater was even more popular. Chikamatsu&#x27;s popularity peaked with his domestic plays of love-suicides, and with the blockbuster success of &quot;The Battles of Coxinga&quot; in 1715, but thereafter the tastes of patrons turned to more sensational gore fests and otherwise more crude antics; Chikamatsu&#x27;s plays would fall into disuse, so even the actual music would be lost for many plays. He died January 6, 1725, in either Amagasaki in Hyōgo, or Osaka.

In 1706, he wrote a three-act puppet play entitled &quot;Goban Taiheiki&quot; (&quot;A chronicle of great peace played on a chessboard&quot;), based on the story of the Forty-seven rōnin; this became the basis of the later and much better-known &quot;Chūshingura&quot;.

Currently, 130 plays have been verified to have been authored by Chikamatsu, with another 15 plays (mostly early Kabuki works) suspected to also have been penned by him.

==Quotations==
* &quot;Art is something that lies in the slender margin between the real and the unreal.&quot; — Chikamatsu Monzaemon, &quot;Naniwa Miyage&quot;

==Reception==
Chikamatsu&#x27;s &quot;bunraku&quot; (&quot;jōruri&quot;) pieces, of which 24 are &quot;sewamono&quot; (domestic plays), came to be regarded as high literature in the Meiji and Taishō eras. Many have argued that his genius was &quot;his masterful depiction of the passions, obsessions, and irrationality of the human heart.&quot; While Chikamatsu&#x27;s &quot;jidaimono&quot; (history plays) were considered more important in his own time, the domestic tragedies are now &quot;the main focus of critical attention and the more frequently performed&quot;, praised as deeply drawn in their portrayals of commoners. &quot;The Love Suicides at Sonezaki&quot; (1703), one of the earliest domestic plays in puppet theater, was a hit that revived the fortunes of the Takemoto Theater in Osaka. While it is not considered as strong as his later play &quot;The Love Suicides at Amijima&quot; (1721), Donald Keene praised the death passage as &quot;one of the loveliest passages in Japanese literature&quot;. Also, it was written in &quot;Early Modern Japanese Literature: An Anthology, 1600–1900&quot; that &quot;The Drum of the Waves of Horikawa&quot; (1707) is &quot;of considerable interest for its exploration of female sexuality and its implicit critique of the life of lower-level samurai&quot;. Rei Sasaguchi listed the same play as one of Chikamatsu&#x27;s most striking &quot;bunraku&quot; works along with &quot;The Couriers of Love to the Other World&quot;.

&quot;The Love Suicides at Amijima&quot; is generally regarded as the greatest of his domestic plays, though &quot;The Courier for Hell&quot; (1711), &quot;The Uprooted Pine&quot; (1718), and &quot;The Woman-Killer and the Hell of Oil&quot; (1721) have also been praised as works &quot;of exceptional power&quot;. The last of the three initially was not well-received, and acquired a high reputation only in the late 19th century. Robert Nichols wrote that &quot;The Almanac of Love&quot; (1715) is highly regarded. Kenneth P. Kirkwood argued that the work is somewhat thin in texture but &quot;nevertheless reveals the playwright&#x27;s skill in making a dramatic plot out of the slightest materials.&quot; In a review of Gerstle&#x27;s &quot;Chikamatsu: Five Late Plays&quot;, Katherine Saltzman-Li praised the &quot;depth of character&quot; achieved in &quot;Twins at the Sumida River&quot; (1720) through the various allusions.

The histories are mostly considered weaker, with Nichols writing that character in them tends to be subordinated to plot. &quot;The Battles of Coxinga&quot; (1715), however, ran for seventeen months and became the classical model for later history plays. It remains in the repertoires of both the &quot;bunraku&quot; and &quot;kabuki&quot; traditions, and Donald Keene referred to it as the only &quot;jidaimono&quot; &quot;with real literary value&quot;. &quot;Keisei hotoke no hara&quot; (1699) and &quot;Keisei mibu dainembutsu&quot; (1702) are among the most renowned kabuki plays, though Keene argued that even they are &quot;inferior in every respect&quot; to the &quot;jōruri&quot; works written around the same period. Nichols listed &quot;The Courtesan&#x27;s Frankincense&quot;, &quot;The Tethered Steed&quot;, and &quot;Fair Ladies at a Game of Poem-Cards&quot; as the best histories. Anne Walthall at UC Irvine said that the &quot;vivid portrayal of interpersonal relations and individual personality [in &quot;Love Suicides on the Eve of the Kōshin Festival&quot;] provides excellent evidence why Chikamatsu&#x27;s domestic plays have become more popular than his historical dramas.&quot; &quot;Devil&#x27;s Island&quot;, the second scene of the second act of &quot;Heike and the Island of Women&quot; (1719), became part of the kabuki repertory in the 19th century and today is usually performed in jōruri and kabuki as a single play.

<text>Interstate 180 (I-180) is a north–south spur highway in Illinois that runs from Princeton to the small town of Hennepin at its southern terminus. It is long.

==Route description==

I-180 begins as a continuation of Illinois Route 71 (IL 71) at a diamond interchange with IL 26 northeast of Hennepin. The interchange is located adjacent to a former steel mill that was most recently operated by ArcelorMittal but closed in 2009 and demolished in 2017. The freeway travels northwest, carrying I-180 and IL 26 in a concurrency, and crosses the Illinois River on the north side of Hennepin to enter Bureau County.

On the west side of the river, IL 26 separates from I-180 and the freeway crosses over IL 29 before splitting at a Y interchange. I-180 turns north, intersecting an expressway that connects to IL 29, and travels northeast across Big Bureau Creek to intersect IL 26. The freeway intersects US Route 6 (US 6) east of Princeton and continues due north to its terminus, a trumpet interchange with I-80. I-180 has four lanes for most of its length, though an additional southbound lane exists prior to the IL 29 exit.

==History==
Construction of I-180 was completed in 1969. The freeway was built primarily to connect I-80 to a new Jones and Laughlin Steel Company steel plant built in 1965 in Hennepin. In August 1970, the U.S. General Accounting Office published a report criticizing the Federal Highway Administration for prioritizing I-180 over spurs in larger metropolitan areas, including Tucson, Arizona and Tacoma, Washington. The report also stated that steel plant officials had demanded construction of the spur to allow trucks from the plant to easily access I-80. The steel plant closed in 2009 and has since been demolished.

I-180 is one of the least traveled Interstates in the nation, serving 1,950–3,600 vehicles per day .

In the 2010s, work started to reconstruct portions of the bridge carrying I-180 over the Illinois River. A three-year project to rebuild the deck began in 2020.

<text>Rödermark is a town in the Offenbach district in the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Darmstadt in Hesse, Germany, southeast of Frankfurt am Main and northeast of Darmstadt.

==Geography==

===Location===
The town lies mostly in the &quot;Messeler Hügelland&quot;, a part of the Lower Main Plain with gentle hills. Differences in elevation are slight, reaching from about 130 m above sea level on the Rodau riverside flats east of Ober-Roden up to about 200 m above sea level on the Bulau. Rödermark is surrounded by greenbelts, found mainly in the area of the river Rodau. The Rodau crosses the municipal area from west to east. The northern areas of Bulau, Messenhausen and Waldacker have a mainly residential function, whereas the main centres of Ober-Roden and Urberach offer a complete infrastructure. The nearest Autobahn interchanges are ten kilometres away, and Frankfurt Airport some 25 km away. Rödermark lies within the area covered by the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund, and on the grounds of Rödermark-Ober-Roden station’s favourable location, it is the terminus of Rhine-Main S-Bahn line S1 and a station on RMV line 61.

The fiftieth parallel of north latitude (50°N) passes through the municipal area.

===Neighbouring communities===
Rödermark borders in the north on the town of Dietzenbach, in the east on the town of Rodgau, in the south on the communities of Eppertshausen and Messel (both in Darmstadt-Dieburg) and in the west on the town of Dreieich.

===Constituent communities===
Rödermark’s &quot;Stadtteile&quot; are Messenhausen with 796 inhabitants, Ober-Roden with 12,749 inhabitants, Urberach with 11,537 inhabitants, Waldacker with 2,885 inhabitants and Bulau (as at 30 June 2007).

====Ober-Roden====
The community of Ober-Roden, which until 1977 was self-administering, is today the biggest of the five constituent communities. Through suburbanization in the 1960s and 1970s, Ober-Roden became an important residential community for commuters.

The town library, the cultural hall, the daycare centre and the primary school all stand right on the brook, the Rodau, in Ober-Roden’s centre and together with the stately Gothic Parish Church of St. Nazarius (locally sometimes called the &quot;Rodgaudom&quot; – Rodgau &quot;Cathedral&quot; – although it is no such thing), some timber-frame houses and a comfortable outdoor café lend the town centre a certain flair.

Ober-Roden is the location of the comprehensive school and &quot;Europaschule&quot; (European school) Oswald-von-Nell-Breuning-Schule

=====Transport in Ober-Roden=====

Ober-Roden is a local rail transport hub. From here begins line S 1 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn towards Wiesbaden by way of Offenbach Ost, Frankfurt Hbf and Frankfurt-Höchst. Also found in Ober-Roden is an operational midpoint on the Dreieich Railway (&quot;Dreieichbahn&quot;) offering links to Urberach and Dreieich (from Dreieich-Buchschlag to Langen, Darmstadt, Frankfurt Airport and Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof) and serving Dieburg in the other direction. From there connections are available to Aschaffenburg, Darmstadt and places in the Odenwald.

In connection with the plans for the &quot;Regionaltangente West&quot; (RTW) project, running the Dreieichbahn with RTW trains was in the past considered. For Ober-Roden this would have meant a direct rail link with Frankfurt Airport. The financing for the needed line expansion, however, is long-term, and the project, at least for the present, does not appear in the general transport plan.

====Urberach====
Urberach was until 31 December 1976 a self-administering community in what was then the Dieburg district. Since municipal reform came into force in Hesse on 1 January 1977, Urberach has been a constituent community of Rödermark, and since then has also belonged to the Offenbach district. Nevertheless, Urberach dwellers today still feel more of a connection with Dieburg and Darmstadt than with Offenbach.

Rödermark has developed itself in all its constituent communities into an attractive residential and living area. Adding to the town’s attractiveness are in particular the new work done on part of the town core in 2003 and 2004, the many shops there together with the market halls on the outskirts, a bathhouse with sauna facilities and greenspace (back in operation in June 2006 after conversion), the hilly location of Bulau with its great worth as a recreation area and other similar things.

Urberach was in the past a centre for the potter’s craft. A pottery museum, a pottery market and the clay vessel in Urberach’s coat of arms all recall this great tradition.

Urberach has been since 2002 the seat of the newly founded &quot;Berufsakademie Rhein-Main&quot;, a professional academy whose focus is on economics and business informatics.

Urberach dwellers call themselves &quot;Orwischer&quot;.

==History==
Rödermark was founded on 1 January 1977 out of the up until this point self-administering communities of Ober-Roden and Urberach. On 23 August 1980, Rödermark was officially granted town rights. The name goes back to the late mediaeval communal forest (&quot;marca raodora&quot;) known as the Rödermark.

Celtic finds have been unearthed in archaeological digs in town.

===History of Ober-Roden===
There is some likelihood that there was once a convent in the community that was put under the Lorsch Abbey by Abbess Aba in 786, but final proof of this is still lacking. The settlement of &quot;Rotaha&quot; had its first documentary mention in 790 in a donation to the Lorsch Abbey. Furthermore, a Frankish nobleman named Erlulf donated all his holdings in Ober-Roden, Nieder-Roden and Bieber to the Lorsch Abbey on 22 April 791.

In 903, the &quot;Rotaha&quot; monastery was confirmed as the Lorsch Abbey’s tenant. The parish church in Ober-Roden is, like the abbey itself, consecrated to Saint Nazarius, and was Mother Church for Urberach, Nieder-Roden, Messel and Dudenhofen.

As part of the &quot;Amt&quot; of Steinheim, the village was sold in 1425 by the former landlords, the Lords of Eppstein, to Electoral Mainz. For the next several centuries the Electoral Prince-Archbishop of Mainz was the landlord.

In 1576 there were 80 households here, but in 1681 there were only 31 households and 117 inhabitants.

In 1786, the communally held land shared by Ober-Roden and several other villages was partitioned and shared out among Ober-Roden, Nieder-Roden, Urberach, Messel, Dietzenbach, Hainhausen, Jügesheim and Dudenhofen.

The &quot;Amtsvogtei&quot; of Dieburg passed with Ober-Roden after Secularization to Hesse. In 1829, Ober-Roden had 1,295 inhabitants. In 1832, the place passed from the &quot;Landratsbezirk&quot; of Langen to the Offenbach district. From 1874 to 1977, the community belonged to the Dieburg district.

In 1896, the &quot;Rodgaubahn&quot; (railway) from Offenbach am Main by way of Ober-Roden to Dieburg was built, as was the &quot;Dreieichbahn&quot; by way of Urberach to Sprendlingen in 1905.

In 1939, the community had 3,608 inhabitants. In 1957, Messenhausen merged with Ober-Roden after having shared with it the same mayor since 1821, while still keeping its own municipal budget. In 1977 in the course of municipal reform in Hesse, Ober-Roden was merged with Urberach, whereupon the new amalgamated municipality became Rödermark.

===History of Urberach===
Urberach was named for the first time in 796 as a branch parish of Ober-Roden according to the Lorsch codex. The place had its first documentary mention in 1275 as &quot;Orbruch&quot;. Electoral Mainz acquired the lordly rights over Urberach in the Late Middle Ages. The village belonged to the Mainz &quot;Amt&quot; of Dieburg.

In 1280, part of Urberach ended up with Frankfurt as a fief.

In 1305, an estate from &quot;Urbruch&quot; belonged to Ober-Roden.

In 1425, Urbruch and Ober-Roden were sold to the Archbishop of Mainz.

In 1706, the Archbishop of Mainz, Lothar Franz von Schönborn, ceded &quot;Urbarach&quot; to Count Johann Philipp of Isenburg-Büdingen in exchange for Weisenau and Hechtsheim. Urberach thenceforth belonged to the &quot;Amt&quot; of Philippseich, a younger line of the House of Isenburg.

In 1786 the Röder Mark was dissolved.

After the Principality of Isenburg-Birstein was dissolved in 1816, Urberach passed to the Grand Duchy of Hesse and has been Hessian ever since. In 1821, the community was grouped into the &quot;Landratsbezirk&quot; of Offenbach and in 1832 assigned to the Offenbach district. From 1874 to 1977, Urberach belonged to the Dieburg district.

The population figure rose from 1,488 in 1861 to 2,807 in 1939 and 9,558 in 1978. In 1977 in the course of municipal reform in Hesse, Urberach was merged with Ober-Roden, whereupon the new amalgamated municipality became Rödermark.

===History of Messenhausen===
The village had its first documentary mention in 1282. In the time that followed, the Lords of Eppstein enfeoffed various noble families with Messenhausen. Up until the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Lords of Frankenstein had been the fiefholders for centuries. In 1806, the community passed to the Grand Duchy of Hesse.

In 1821, Messenhausen’s mayoral office was united with Ober-Roden’s, although each place maintained its own budget up until 1957, when Messenhausen joined Ober-Roden. Messenhausen had 80 inhabitants in 1829 and 605 in 1978.

==Churches==
Rödermark’s traditional character is Catholic. Owing to migration into the town in the latter half of the 20th century, however, many Evangelical Christians now also live here. Today there are five Christian parishes:

* St. Nazarius Ober-Roden (Catholic)
* Ober-Roden (Evangelical)
* St. Gallus Urberach (Catholic)
* Petrusgemeinde Urberach (Evangelical)
* Free Evangelical parish of Rödermark

The oldest ecclesiastical building in Rödermark is the &quot;Dreifaltigkeitskapelle&quot; (“Trinity Chapel”) on the way into the community of Messenhausen (built in 1820).

==Politics==

===Town council===
The municipal elections held from 2006 to 2021 yielded the following results:
===Mayors===
Rödermark’s mayors since 1977 have been:
*Karl Martin Rebel, CDU (1977–1982)
*Walter Faust, CDU (1982–1993)
*Alfons Maurer, CDU (1993–2005)
*Roland Kern, AL/Greens (2005–2019)
*Jörg Rotter, CDU (2019–present)

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Rödermark is twinned with:
* Tramin an der Weinstraße, Italy (1975, originally with Urberach)
* Saalfelden am Steinernen Meer, Austria (1976, originally with Ober-Roden)
* Bodajk, Hungary (1992)
* Pleśna, Poland (2022)

<text>Hugh Lamprey (2 August 1928 - 10 February 1996) was a British ecologist and bush pilot. After travelling on student expeditions to Iceland, the Himalayas, and the Canary Islands, he served in Palestine and Egypt as a tank officer. Subsequently he obtained a position in Tanganyika, and in the Game Department in 1953, he designed methods of estimating game densities that are still widely used. He applied these to studies of food sources of Tsetse flies (specifically &quot;Glossina swynnertoni&quot;) in Kenya.

In 1975 he prepared a United Nations Environment Programme report on desertification in the African Sahel region, in which he concluded that &quot;the desert southern boundary has shifted south&quot; by an average of in the preceding 17 years. This statement has been instrumental to the belief that desertification is a great threat to the world and especially Africa.

<doc id="463361" wikidata="Q34128" url="?curid=463361" title="Tahitian language">
<text>Tahitian (autonym: , , part of , , languages of French Polynesia) is a Polynesian language, spoken mainly on the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Eastern Polynesian group.

As Tahitian had no written tradition before the arrival of the Western colonists, the spoken language was first transcribed by missionaries of the London Missionary Society in the early 19th century.

==Context==
Tahitian is the most prominent of the indigenous Polynesian languages spoken in French Polynesia (). The latter also include:
*Marquesan, spoken by about 8,000 people in the Marquesas Islands, with two sub-divisions, North-Western () and South-Eastern ()
*Paumotu (), spoken by about 4,000 people in the Tuamotu Islands
*Austral, spoken by about 3,000 people in the Austral Islands
*Rapa, spoken by about 400 people on Rapa Iti
*Raivavae, spoken by about 900 people in the Austral Islands
*Mangareva, spoken by about 600 people in the Gambier Islands

==History==
When Europeans first arrived in Tahiti at the end of the 18th century, there was no writing system and Tahitian was only a spoken language. Reports by some early European explorers including Quirós include attempts to transcribe notable Tahitian words heard during initial interactions with the indigenous people of Marquesa. Aboard the Endeavour, Lt. James Cook and the ship&#x27;s master, Robert Molyneux, transcribed the names of 72 and 55 islands respectively as recited by the Tahitian arioi, Tupaia. Many of these were &quot;non-geographic&quot; or &quot;ghost islands&quot; of Polynesian mythology and all were transcribed using phonetic English spelling. In 1797, Protestant missionaries arrived in Tahiti on a British ship called &quot;Duff&quot;, captained by James Wilson. Among the missionaries was Henry Nott (1774–1844) who learned the Tahitian language and worked with Pōmare II, a Tahitian king, and the Welsh missionary, John Davies (1772–1855), to translate the Bible into Tahitian. A system of five vowels and nine consonants was adopted for the Tahitian Bible, which would become the key text by which many Polynesians would learn to read and write. John Davies&#x27;s spelling book (1810) was the first book to be printed in the Tahitian language. He also published a grammar and a dictionary of that language.

== Phonology ==
Tahitian features a very small number of phonemes: five vowels and nine consonants, not counting the lengthened vowels and diphthongs. Notably, the consonant inventory lacks any sort of phonemic dorsal consonants.

There is a five-vowel inventory with vowel length:
When two vowels follow each other in a V1V2 sequence, they form a diphthong when V1 is more open, and as a consequence more sonorant, than V2. An exception to this rule is the sequence , which never becomes the diphthong . Two vowels with the same sonority are generally pronounced in hiatus, as in &#x27;November&#x27;, but there is some variability. The word &#x27;June&#x27; may be pronounced , with hiatus, or , with a diphthong.

Next follows a table with all phonemes in more detail.

The glottal stop or is a genuine consonant. This is typical of Polynesian languages (compare to the Hawaiian okina and others). See Typography below.

Tahitian makes a phonemic distinction between long and short vowels; long vowels are marked with macron or . For example, , meaning &#x27;to pick, to pluck&#x27; and , &#x27;to break out&#x27;, are distinguished solely by their vowel length. However, macrons are seldom written among older people because Tahitian writing was not taught at school until 1981.

In rapid speech, the common article is pronounced with a schwa, as .

Also in rapid speech, sequences are dissimilated to , so &#x27;man, male&#x27; is pronounced , &#x27;president&#x27; becomes . Intervening syllables prevent this dissimilation, so &#x27;eye&#x27; is never pronounced with a .
While standard Tahitian only has as a result of dissimilation, the dialects of the Leeward Islands have many cases of corresponding to standard Tahitian . For example, inhabitants of Maupiti pronounce their island&#x27;s name .

Finally there is a , a trema put on the i, but only used in when used as a reflexive pronoun. It does not indicate a different pronunciation. Usage of this diacritic was promoted by academics but has now virtually disappeared, mostly because there is no difference in the quality of the vowel when the trema is used and when the macron is used.

Tahitian syllables are entirely open, as is usual in Polynesian languages. If a content word is composed of a single syllable with a single vowel, its vowel must be long. Thus, every Tahitian content word is at least two moras long.

=== Stress ===
Stress is predictable in Tahitian. It always falls on one of the final three syllables of a word, and relies on the distinction between heavy and light syllables. Syllables with diphthongs or with long vowels are both considered to be heavy. Other syllables are considered to be light. Heavy syllables always bear secondary stress. In general main stress falls on the penultimate syllable in a word. However, if there is a long vowel or diphthong in the last syllable, that syllable receives main stress. If there is a long vowel in the antepenultimate syllable, and the penultimate syllable is light, the antepenultimate syllable receives main stress.

There is another type of words whose stress pattern requires another rule to explain. These include &#x27;first&#x27;, &#x27;shoe&#x27;, &#x27;king&#x27;, all of which are stressed on the antepenultimate syllable. In all these words, the last two vowels are identical, and are separated by a glottal stop. One can posit that in such words, the last syllable is extrametrical, and does not count towards stress assignment.
This extrametricality does not apply in the case of words with only two syllables, which remain stressed on the penultimate syllable.

In compound words, each morpheme&#x27;s stressed syllable carries secondary stress, and the stressed syllable of the last morpheme carries primary stress. Thus, for example, &#x27;airplane&#x27;, from &#x27;bird&#x27; and &#x27;leave&#x27;, is pronounced .
Tahitian has reduplication as well. The endings of some verbs can be duplicated in order to add a repetitive sense to the verb. For example, becomes , &#x27;do quickly&#x27; becomes , and &#x27;to tear&#x27; becomes . In reduplicated verbs, the final verb ending bears main stress while the earlier ones bears secondary stress.

When suffixes are added to a word, primary and secondary stresses in the root word are maintained as secondary and tertiary stresses, and a new primary stress is calculated for the word. Tertiary and secondary stress are often merged. The suffix does not always carry main stress. For example, when the nominalizing suffix is applied to verbs, regular stress assignment results in the last syllable of the root verb being stressed. This is due to the destressing of the V in . To give an example, the word &#x27;life&#x27;, from &#x27;to live&#x27; and , is pronounced with antepenultimate stress.

Prefixes added to a root word do not carry primary stress. For example, &#x27;vision&#x27;, related to &#x27;vision&#x27;, is stressed on the second syllable, and not the first, even though it has a long vowel. This can also be seen with the verb &#x27;to be understood&#x27;. When combined with the causative prefix , it becomes , which is stressed on the penultimate syllable.

== Typography ==
In former practice, the Tahitian glottal stop () used to be seldom written, but today it is commonly spelled out, although often as a straight apostrophe or a curly apostrophe preferred typographically, see below) instead of the turned curly apostrophe used in Hawaiian (locally named ). Alphabetical word ordering in dictionaries used to ignore the existence of glottal stops. However, academics and scholars now publish text content with due use of glottal stops.

Although the use of and is equal to the usage of such symbols in other Polynesian languages, it is promoted by the and adopted by the territorial government. There are at least a dozen other ways of applying accents. Some methods are historical and no longer used. At this moment, the seems to have not made a final decision yet whether the should appear as a normal letter apostrophe () or a turned letter apostrophe (, called in Hawaiian).

As the ASCII apostrophe () is the character output when hitting the apostrophe key on a usual French AZERTY keyboard, it has become natural for writers to use the punctuation mark for glottal stops, although to avoid the complications caused by automatic substitution of basic punctuation characters for letters in digital documents, and the confusion with the regular apostrophe used in multilingual texts mixing Tahitian with French (where the apostrophe marks the elision of a final schwa at end of common pronouns, prepositions or particles, and the orthographic suppression of the separating regular space before a word starting by a vowel sound, in order to indicate a single phonemic syllable partly spanning the two words), the saltillo () may be used instead.

Today, macronized vowels and are also available on mobile devices, either by default or after installing an application to input vowels with macron as well as the . 

Tahitian is one of the few Austronesian languages – along with standard Samoan or Volow – that do not have a phoneme , and do not use the letter &quot;K&quot;.

== Grammar ==
In its morphology, Tahitian relies on the use of &quot;helper words&quot; (such as prepositions, articles, and particles) to encode grammatical relationships, rather than on inflection, as would be typical of European languages. It is a very analytic language, except when it comes to the personal pronouns, which have separate forms for singular, plural and dual numbers.

===Personal pronouns===
Like many Austronesian languages, Tahitian has separate words for inclusive and exclusive we, and distinguishes singular, dual, and plural.

==== Singular ====
* ( after &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot;) &#x27;I, me&#x27;: &#x27;I have eaten the fish&#x27;; &#x27;I will go to school tomorrow&#x27;.
* &#x27;you&#x27;: &#x27;You have eaten the fish&#x27;; &#x27;You damaged our car&#x27;.
* &#x27;he, she&#x27;: &#x27;He/she ate the fish&#x27;; &#x27;Why is she here/why did she come here?&#x27;; &#x27;He/she is not here&#x27;.

==== Dual ====
* &#x27;(inclusive) we/us two&#x27;: &#x27;We (us two) have eaten the fish&#x27;; &#x27;Let&#x27;s go&#x27; (literally &#x27;go us two&#x27;); &#x27;Our friend has arrived&#x27;.
* &#x27;(exclusive) we/us two&#x27;: &#x27;We have eaten the fish&#x27;; &#x27;Titaua and I will return/go home&#x27;; &#x27;That is our house&#x27;.
* &#x27;you two&#x27;: &#x27;You two ate the fish&#x27;; &#x27;You (two) go&#x27;; &#x27;This book belongs to both of you&#x27;.
* &#x27;they two&#x27;: &#x27;They (they two) have eaten the fish&#x27;; &#x27;Where are they (they two) from?&#x27;; &#x27;He/she and Pa stayed home&#x27;.

==== Plural ====
* &#x27;(inclusive) we&#x27;: &#x27;Who are we waiting for/expecting?&#x27;, &#x27;There won&#x27;t be any of our food more left&#x27;.
* &#x27;(exclusive) we, they and I&#x27;: &#x27;We came with Herenui&#x27;; &#x27;You saw us/you have seen us&#x27;.
* &#x27;you (plural)&#x27;: &#x27;You (all) go, I will follow&#x27;; &#x27;Who went fishing with you (all)?&#x27;
* &#x27;they/them&#x27;: &#x27;They have quarrelled with Teina&#x27;; They have the strongest team.

===Word order===
Typologically, Tahitian word order is VSO (verb–subject–object), which is typical of Polynesian languages, or verb-attribute-subject for stating verbs/modality (without object). Some examples of word order are:



===Articles===

====Definite article====
The article is the definite article and means &#x27;the&#x27;. In conversation it is also used as an indefinite article for &#x27;a&#x27; or &#x27;an&#x27; – for example:
* – &#x27;the house&#x27;; – &#x27;the man&#x27;

The plural of the definite article &quot; is – for example:
* – &#x27;the houses&#x27;; – &#x27;the men&#x27;

&quot; alone (with no plural marking) can also encode an unspecified, generic number – for example:

* – &#x27;the person&#x27; or &#x27;people&#x27; 
vs.
* – &#x27;the people&#x27; 

====Indefinite article====

The indefinite article is 

For example;
* – &#x27;a person&#x27;

The article &quot; also introduces an indefinite common noun.

For example;
* – &#x27;a person&#x27;
* – &#x27;a woman&#x27;
* – &#x27;(many) women&#x27;

In contrast, means &#x27;a certain&#x27;.

For example;
* – &#x27;a certain house&#x27;
The article is used with proper nouns and pronouns and implies &#x27;it is&#x27;.

For example;
* – &#x27;(it is) Tahiti&#x27;
* – &#x27;(it is) they&#x27;

===Aspect and modality markers===

Verbal aspect and modality are important parts of Tahitian grammar, and are indicated with markers preceding and/or following the invariant verb. Important examples are:

* &quot;: continuous aspect; expresses an ongoing action or state.
*: – , &quot;Mary will sing tonight&quot;
*: – , &quot;He is always late&quot;
* : expresses a finished action, in a consequent state different from a preceding state. [&quot;&quot; does not indicate surprise]
*: – , &quot;I am angry&quot;
* : indicates progressive aspect.
*: – , &quot;I am planting the taro&quot;
* indicates a finished action or a past state.
*: – , &quot;She was born in Tahiti&quot;
* indicates an action finished in the immediate past.
*: – , &quot;He just came&quot;
* indicates a wish, desire, hope, assumption, or condition.
*: – , &quot;Hurry up!&quot;
* indicates a command or obligation.
*: – &quot;Bend down!&quot;
* indicates negative imperative.
*: – &quot;Don&#x27;t speak!&quot;
* , indicates a condition or hypothetical supposition.
*: – &quot;If the boat had capsized, we would all be dead&quot;
* expresses negation.
*: – , &quot;I will not return&quot;

== Taboo names – ==

In many parts of Polynesia the name of an important leader was (and sometimes still is) considered sacred (&quot;tapu&quot;) and was therefore accorded appropriate respect (&quot;mana&quot;). In order to avoid offense, all words resembling such a name were suppressed and replaced by another term of related meaning until the personage died. If, however, the leader should happen to live to a very great age this temporary substitution could become permanent.

In the rest of Polynesia &quot;tū&quot; means &#x27;to stand&#x27;, but in Tahitian it became because the word was included in the name of king Tū-nui-ēa-i-te-atua. Likewise &quot;fetū&quot; (&#x27;star&#x27;) has become in Tahiti and &quot;aratū&quot; (&#x27;pillar&#x27;) became . Although (&#x27;big&#x27;) still occurs in some compounds, like , the usual word is (which is a common word in Polynesian languages for &#x27;large&#x27;). The term fell into disuse, replaced by or . Currently means &#x27;path&#x27; while means &#x27;road&#x27;.

Tū also had a nickname, Pō-mare (literally means &#x27;night coughing&#x27;), under which his dynasty has become best known. By consequence (&#x27;night&#x27;) became (currently only used in the Bible, &quot;&quot; having become the word commonly in use once again), but (literally &#x27;cough&#x27;) has irreversibly been replaced by .

Other examples include:
* (&#x27;water&#x27;) became as in the names of Papeari, Papenoo, Papeete
* (&#x27;sleep&#x27;) became (the original meaning of which was &#x27;to lie down&#x27;).

Some of the old words are still used on the Leewards.

<text>Events from the year 1921 in France.

==Incumbents==
*President: Alexandre Millerand 
*President of the Council of Ministers: Georges Leygues (until 16 January), Aristide Briand (starting 15 January)

==Events==

Alexandre Millerand had been elected president of the republic in 1920, with Georges Leygues taking his place as prime minister. Frequent changes of ministry had shown that even in peace times an unstable government was in a difficult situation. In a time of unrest and insecurity, the interests of the government might be wholly prejudicial to those of the country.

Millerand&#x27;s acts during his ministry both in his domestic and his foreign policy had met with the unanimous approval of the nation, and his popularity reached its height in September 1920, when by 695 votes out of 892 he was elected president of the republic. Among the members of Parliament opposed to his appointment there were many keen partisans of the leader whose eminent qualities had been put to the test during a period of over eight months. They did not wish to see Millerand occupying a merely representative position, which is all the French constitution allows to the president. They wanted to see so able a man at the helm of the ship of state, with real and not apparent power. Hopes were therefore raised in some quarters that the constitution would be amended to give more scope to the president. But these hopes were dashed to the ground when, on 12 January, Leygues retired from office.

The Chamber of Deputies, by dismissing the minister selected by Millerand, expressed its wish to give power to a strong man whose conduct was not to be modified by any influence. Lack of firmness was the principal fault with which Leygues was charged by the majority of the Parliament. As a matter of fact, the dismissal of the premier was expected as an imminent event when Parliament reopened on 11 January.

On that day Raoul Péret, who was reelected chairman of the Chamber, delivered a most interesting speech dealing with the difficulties of the moment. Leygues&#x27; request for the postponement of the intended interpellations of several deputies until after the inter-Allied conference due on the 19th was refused in the House by 447 votes out of 563. The cabinet was therefore compelled to retire. Next day the Senate met and reelected Léon Bourgeois as its chairman.

Millerand confided to Péret, chairman of the Chamber, the task of constituting a new ministry. After having endeavoured to obtain the cooperation of various personalities specially designated by the voice of public opinion, Péret found he was unable to surmount the difficulties caused by private antagonisms. He was particularly unsuccessful in obtaining the support of Aristide Briand and Raymond Poincaré, whose views on certain points of foreign policy differed from his own.

Thereupon Briand was entrusted with the difficult task of forming a cabinet. Briand had already been premier three times. Born in 1862 at Nantes, he was first elected deputy in 1902 for the Department of Loire, which reelected him until 1914. He was minister of public instruction in 1906, minister of justice in 1908, and prime minister in 1909. He was again prime minister in 1913 and, during the war, from 1915 to 1917. In 1919 he was reelected deputy by the Department of Loire-Inférieure, the chief town of which is his native place.

Like most French politicians Briand had gradually changed his mind in the course of the last years before the war. From fervent socialism he turned towards moderate opinions; as they say in France, &quot;he put water into his wine&quot;.

On 16 January Briand succeeded in constituting his cabinet as follows:

In accordance with the suggestion made by the British government that, owing to the French ministerial crisis, the inter-Allied conference should be postponed, the new government agreed that the conference should take place on 24 January.

On 17 January nine under-secretaries of state were appointed as follows:

The new cabinet appeared before Parliament on 20 January, the ministerial declaration being read by Briand in the Chamber and by Pierre Marraud in the Senate. This long declaration, modelled on the usual patterns, expressed much that was encouraging, but was not as explicit as the remarkable speech which Briand delivered on the following day, and which dealt with the political programme of the new government. In regard to foreign policy, Briand expressed his firm intention to make Germany pay, and he also promised to make every effort toward the revival of diplomatic relations with the Vatican.

The Chamber expressed its confidence in the new cabinet by 462 votes out of 539.

On the 24th, the Paris conference opened at the Foreign Office, with Briand in the chair. Eight days had been sufficient for him to make himself familiar with the grave problems of the moment, and France realized and valued the marvellous effort of the new premier.

The leading personalities of the delegations at the conference were: for France, Briand, Louis Barthou, and Philippe Berthelot; for Britain, David Lloyd George and Lord Curzon; for Italy, Count Carlo Sforza, Count Lelio Bonin Longare, and Marquis Pietro Tomasi Della Torretta; for Belgium, Henri Jaspar and Georges Theunis; and for Japan, Viscount Kikujiro Ishii.

The conference lasted five days, and was marked by a complete agreement among the Allies. The terms of the conditions of disarmament and reparations fixed by unanimous accord were forwarded to Germany.

On the day before the conference ended (28 January) there took place the solemn burial of the Unknown Soldier under the Arc de Triomphe. Barthou, the war minister, delivered a most moving oration, and Lloyd George who was present threw into the grave Britain&#x27;s floral tribute.

Amongst the significant events which occurred in January, the dissolution of the General Confederation of Labour (C.G.T.) is not the least important. The breaking-up of this organization was promulgated on the 13th by the Tribunal Correctionnel following on the revolutionary strikes which had occurred in April and May 1920. The majority of the nation approved of this course. Many workmen themselves had protested against certain strike-orders, given by their leaders, as was alleged, for merely political or revolutionary purposes; and no doubt the C.G.T. had lost the support of public opinion.

Before the close of January there was a distinct improvement in the value of the franc, which dropped from sixty to fifty-two for the pound sterling.

During the whole of February French opinion watched the attitude of Germany with no little expectancy.

On the 1st Millerand expressed his most ardent congratulations to Briand and his colleagues on the part they had taken in the Paris conference. The results of the conference were placed before the Chamber by Briand on 3 February, and after discussing the question for seven days, the House expressed its confidence in the cabinet by 387 votes out of 522.

On 19 February, three more generals were promoted &quot;marshals of France&quot;, &quot;viz.&quot;, General Émile Fayolle, General Louis Franchet d&#x27;Esperey, and General Hubert Lyautey. These, together with Marshal Joseph Joffre, Marshal Ferdinand Foch, and Marshal Philippe Pétain, raised the number of French marshals to six.

During February Marshal Józef Piłsudski, the head of the Polish state, paid a visit to France in the interests of Franco-Polish amity.

Franco-British friendship was also deepened as a result of Lloyd George&#x27;s reply to the German delegation at the London conference. Indeed, never since the armistice had the Entente Cordiale been so greatly appreciated in France. The results of the conference were approved by the Chamber on 17 March, after a two days&#x27; debate, by 490 votes out of 559. French troops joined British and Belgian battalions in the further occupation of German territory. The Chamber had already authorized the minister of war, on 4 March, to incorporate the conscripts born in 1901.

The government also cultivated Franco-American relations. On 19 March René Viviani, a former prime minister, was sent to the United States, where he was received in special audience by President Warren G. Harding.

Meanwhile, questions of finance were before both houses of Parliament. Early in April the Senate discussed expenditure on foreign affairs, finally agreeing to the proposals of the government. The Senate also agreed to the government&#x27;s request for 120 million francs for the continuance of French propaganda in Syria. The budget of 1921 was finally discussed by the Senate on 16 April. One of the provisions of the Finance Law limited the number of ministries in future to twelve, and of under-secretaries of state to four.

On 12 April, by a unanimous vote of the Chamber, the dignity of Marshal of France was granted to the late General Joseph Gallieni, who defended Paris in 1914.

An event of national importance of a much earlier date was commemorated by Joan of Arc&#x27;s day (8 May) instituted as a national holiday by the law of July 1920. On 16 April Marraud, minister of the interior, sent to the prefects a circular regarding this celebration, requesting them to take the necessary steps in order to solemnize the day with great display. He pointed out that the memory of Jeanne d&#x27;Arc should not be the exclusive possession of any one religious body, but should be the common property of the whole nation. These sentiments, echoed by a cabinet minister, reflected the government&#x27;s changed attitude towards the Catholic Church which culminated in the endeavour to reestablish diplomatic relations with the Vatican.

As regards the inter-Allied decisions, the Senate on 21 April ratified the laying of a 50% tax on German imports as decided at the last London conference. In the following week Briand started for London to attend the inter-Allied conference. From London, on 2 May, he instructed the war minister by telephone to call back the 1919 class to the colours, in view of the possible decision of the Allies to occupy the Ruhr district, in accordance with the scheme drawn up by Marshal Foch. But as on 10 May Germany acceded to the Allied terms, this possibility did not arise. Nevertheless, the 1919 class were not liberated until 21 June.

It is worthy of note that May Day passed off in France without any popular manifestations. All the more remarkable were the other celebrations during May. On the 4th and 5th France recalled the hundredth anniversary of the death of Napoleon; on the 8th Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&#x27;s day was fitly observed; while on the 15th an important meeting of athletic societies was held at Lille which Millerand attended, thus giving his high approval to the general tendency towards the encouragement of sport in France.

The London conference was followed by a debate in Parliament on the government&#x27;s foreign policy. For six days, from 19 to 25 May, the government was subjected to attacks, which the prime minister met successfully, carrying with him the Chamber, which gave him a vote of confidence of 390 votes out of 552.

On 27 May, the Chamber passed a resolution authorizing the free import of wheat, and on 7 June the peace treaty with Hungary was ratified.

During the last days of June parliamentary circles were somewhat excited by the bankruptcy of the &quot;Banque Industrielle de Chine&quot;, and the government was once again strongly attacked by several deputies on account of its supposed relations with the bank.

On 1 July, the &quot;Journal Officiel&quot; published the result of the census taken in March, according to which the total population was found to be 37,499,300, as against over 38,000,000 in 1911. The drop was chiefly due to the loss of 1,500,000 men in the war.

Owing to a heatwave at the beginning of July, the government decided not to hold the annual review of troops which was due to take place on the race-course of Longchamp, near Paris, on the morning of the National Day, 14 July. But as usual the French government received on that day the congratulations of foreign governments. The United States happily timed for 14 July the arrival in Paris of their new ambassador, Myron T. Herrick, a well-known Francophile. Briand met Herrick at the Gare Saint-Lazare, and he was given a good reception all along his route. General indignation was expressed at an attempt to assassinate him on 19 October at the American embassy.

The end of July was marked by a great maritime display at Le Havre, attended by Millerand as well as the minister of marine. This had been set up by the &quot;Maritime and Colonial League&quot; to help the recovery of the French navy and merchant fleet. A further step in the same direction was the creation in October of an Academy of Shipping constituted by leading personalities of the shipping world for the revival of the shipping trade and the improvement of freight conditions.

On 6 August Mgr. Bonaventure Ceretti handed to Millerand, at the Château de Rambouillet, his credentials as legate from the pope to the government of the French Republic. &quot;This reception&quot;, said the legate, &quot;which in other times would have been merely a happy incident of no great consequence, today constitutes an event of historic importance, and it is especially to you and to your distinguished predecessor that should be attributed the merit of having prepared the way for its realization.&quot; Without waiting for the formal approval of Parliament, Briand sent Auguste Jonnart as extraordinary ambassador to the Vatican. This action was brought up in the Senate on 8 December, and led to a fierce debate, the question being treated by the government as one of confidence. The Left, with Gaston Doumergue as its chief spokesman, strongly opposed the government, stating the dangers to which the &quot;laicality&quot; of the republic would be exposed by the appointment of a French ambassador to the Vatican. Doumergue was successfully opposed by some Alsatian senators who said that this standpoint had been abandoned during the war. In the end the Senate on 15 December passed a vote of confidence in the government, approving of the revival of diplomatic relations between France and the Vatican.

A few days after the arrival of Mgr. Ceretti, France welcomed members of the American Legion who had crossed the Atlantic to pay a visit to the battlefields. On 11 September celebrations were held at Meaux to mark the seventh anniversary of the victory of the Marne. Barthou, the minister of war, attended the ceremony together with Marshal Joffre and General Maunoury.

Meanwhile, a general strike had broken out in the north of France, in support of a strike of textile workers owing to a threat to reduce wages. The dispute was finally settled by the intervention of the government.

On 2 October Georges Clemenceau, the &quot;Tiger&quot;, who had just returned from his tiger shooting in India, reentered the political arena for the first time since his resignation, by delivering a speech at Sainte-Hermines in La Vendée on the occasion of the unveiling of his own monument. Replying to the many reproaches levelled at him since his return to private life, he said that it was his successors who had not upheld the rights of France under the Treaty of Versailles. &quot;Yesterday&quot;, he declared, &quot;we were victorious. May we not be put today in such a position that we shall wonder whether we are still victorious!&quot; These words referred to the charge brought against Clemenceau of having sacrificed the rights of France to what is called &quot;the policy of alliances&quot;. The conflict of these two principles has placed all the French premiers since the armistice on the horns of a dilemma. They have had to choose repeatedly between insisting on the rights of France in their integrity, especially the claim to reparation in full from Germany, and consenting to concessions required by their allies. If they lean to the former alternative, they have to face a protest from the Left; if to the latter, they incur the censure of the Right and Centre. Briand in this respect has fared no better than his predecessors. On 9 October he delivered a speech at St. Nazaire which contained an eloquent statement of the results of the war and the aspirations of France, but gave no clear indication of the way to obtain the realization of these aspirations. The tone of the press showed that the country was somewhat disappointed.

Parliament reopened on 18 October, and then began a keen fight against the government, carried on by the Right and Centre parties reinforced by the old followers of Clemenceau. Eighteen deputies had sent in notice of interpellation on the government&#x27;s policy. Léon Daudet, the Royalist deputy, led the attack, criticizing the government for having given up the customs-line of the Rhine which constituted the most important security for the payment of Germany&#x27;s war debt. Maurice Barrès levelled the same reproach at Briand. He insisted that France should have a &quot;Rhine policy&quot;, and his speech met with the approval of the majority of the Chamber. On the 25th André Tardieu, one of the negotiators of the Treaty of Versailles, in continuing the debate severely indicted the Left party, the &quot;Bloc des gauches&quot;, the leading party before the war, which is now endeavouring to regain its lost supremacy from the &quot;Bloc National&quot;, constituted by the last elections of 1919. Édouard Herriot, the mayor of Lyon, one of the most prominent members of the &quot;Bloc des gauches&quot;, vigorously refuted the charges of Tardieu. On 26 October the Chamber finally passed a vote of confidence in the government by 339 votes out of 517.

Early in October, the minister of justice issued instructions to all the presidents of tribunals of France that the seconds of a duel should be prosecuted as accomplices in the offense, thus making the legislation in regard to duelling much more stringent. In the course of the same month Marraud, minister of the interior, gave notice of the introduction of a bill for the greater decentralization of the administration of France.

France having decided to take part in the Washington conference, the opening of which had been fixed for 12 November, Marshal Foch sailed for the United States on 22 October on board the new liner &quot;Paris&quot;, the largest French vessel afloat, which had been put into service by the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique on 15 June on the Havre-New York line; and on 29 October, Briand left France for Washington, accompanied by Albert Sarraut, minister for the colonies, René Viviani, ex-prime minister, Philippe Berthelot, general secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the other members of the delegation.

On the 21st, Briand delivered a sensational speech at Washington, in which he exposed the German danger. The delegates of the Allied countries approved of this statement, but the questions of naval disarmament and the Japanese alliance monopolized the attention of the conference to the exclusion of the vital questions of reparations and disarmament of Germany. As was expected, Briand had to face severe criticism when on 8 December he made a statement on the Washington conference before the Senate.

During the absence of the premier, Millerand attended at Montpellier, together with four ministers, the celebration of the seventh centenary of the Faculty of Medicine, which took place on 6 November.

A few days later, a great debate on the budget took place in the Chamber. Paul Doumer, minister for finance, announced a serious deficit. Several deputies took occasion to criticize the defective yield of the income tax. An ex-minister, Louis Deschamps, made an attack on the government monopolies, alleging that the state was a bad trader - an opinion general in France. The discussion of the budget lasted until 15 December, when the Chamber, in a night sitting, finally voted the whole of the credits asked for by the government. A few days later, on the 24th, the question of the bankruptcy of the Banque Industrielle de Chine, which had happened in the last days of June, was brought up again in the Chamber. The government met successfully a strong attack on its attitude towards this bank, but, as a consequence of this attack, Philippe Berthelot, general secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose brother was the chairman of the bank, retired from office. On the 27th, after a long debate, the Chamber expressed its confidence in the government by 391 votes out of 604.

The year 1921 was one of slow recovery for France. The output of mines and factories has been notably increased, but the trading conditions are still unsatisfactory. It is believed in many quarters that the law instituting the eight-hour day is one of the chief reasons for the slowness in the revival of industry, and there is little doubt that the efforts which are being made by a few Socialists to extend this regulation to agriculture will be checked by Parliament. As regards the financial situation, it is noticeable that the government have decided not to issue any new loans, as these have the disadvantage of drawing private capital away from industry. The government hope to do more for reestablishing the public finances by encouraging the recovery of trade. But despite all this many Frenchmen believe that France needs reparations in order to restore her ruins, and that her revival depends on the payment of the German war debt. In the last days of 1921 the country was looking towards Cannes, where a new inter-Allied conference was due to take place.

<text>Bevil Gordon D&#x27;Urban Rudd (5 October 1894 – 2 February 1948) was a South African athlete, the 1920 Olympic Champion in the 400 metres.

== Biography ==
Rudd was born in Kimberley. He was the son of Henry Percy Rudd and Mable Mina Blyth; paternal grandson of Charles Rudd, who co-founded the De Beers diamond mining company, and Frances Chiappini and maternal grandson of Captain Matthew Smith Blyth CMG, chief magistrate of the Transkei, and Elizabeth Cornelia Philpott.

During his schooling at St. Andrew&#x27;s College, Grahamstown (Upper House) he excelled both as a student and as an athlete, and he was granted a scholarship for the University of Oxford. Rudd served in the First World War, and was awarded a Military Cross for bravery.

Ruud won two British AAA Championships titles in the 440 yards and 880 yards events at the 1920 AAA Championships. The following month at the 1920 Olympic Games held in Antwerp, Belgium, Rudd won his gold medal.

Rudd finished runner-up in both the 440 and 880 yards at the 1921 AAA Championships before completing his studies in England, and returning to South Africa, working as a sports journalist.

He married Ursula Mary Knight, daughter of Clifford Hume Knight the Italian Consul to Cape Town, in 1926; they had at least two sons: Bevil John Blyth Rudd and Clifford Robin David Rudd, the South African Cricketer.

In 1930, he became an editor for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, a position he held until after the Second World War. Shortly after his return to South Africa, he died there at age 53.

<text>Raphaël Poirée (born 9 August 1974) is a retired French biathlete who was active from 1995 to 2007. With his 44 World Cup victories and several World Championship medals he ranks among the most successful biathletes ever.

== Sports career ==
Poirée was born in Rives, Isère in France and like the rest of his colleagues in the French biathlon and cross-country skiing team, was a sport soldier.

Poirée has four IBU World Cup titles (1999−00, 2000−01, 2001−02 and 2003−04). He has also come second once, in 2005−06 and third once, in the 2004−05 season. Poirée has had 103 World Cup podium finishes, 44 in first place, 39 in second, and has come third 20 times. In the Winter Olympics, Poiree has one silver and two bronze medals. At the World Championships however, he has seven gold medals, three silver and seven bronze.

Raphaël Poirée was one of the best mass start biathletes of his time, with 9 1st places, 4 2nd places, and 3 3rd places in his World Cup career, second only to Ole Einar Bjørndalen who got 10 1st places, 5 2nd places and 4 3rd places in the same time frame. Poirée also won 4 out of the 7 World Championship mass start races he took part in.

Poirée also had five victories at the Holmenkollen ski festival biathlon competition with three mass starts (2000, 2002, and 2004), one pursuit (2004) and one individual (2007).

After winning the gold medal at the World Championships in Antholz in 2007, Poiree announced the end of his career after that World Cup season. He eventually chose to retire after the Holmenkollen World Cup meet (i.e. before the season&#x27;s last WC meet, in Khanty-Mansyisk in Russia the week after); his last competition was the Mass start race on Sunday 11 March, where he finished in second place after a cm-close last sprint to the finish line against his long-time competitor Ole Einar Bjørndalen of Norway.

==Personal life==
He married Norwegian biathlete Liv Grete Skjelbreid Poirée on 27 May 2000 in Norway. They first met at the 1992 Junior World Championships and began dating in 1996. They have three daughters together, Emma (born 27 January 2003), Anna (born 10 January 2007) and Lena (born 10 October 2008). They have a flat in La Chapelle-en-Vercors, France, but live mostly in Liv Grete&#x27;s home village of Hålandsdal, Norway. The Poirées are the only husband and wife to win medals in the same Olympics for different nations. At the 2002 Winter Olympics, France&#x27;s Raphaël and Norway&#x27;s Liv won matching silver medals in the biathlon. In July 2013, the couple announced that they were separating.

In 2009, Poirée was involved in a quad-bike accident which nearly left him paralysed. One month after undergoing neck and back surgery he was released from hospital.

He speaks French, English, Norwegian and Italian

<doc id="463375" wikidata="Q1348255" url="?curid=463375" title="Sir John Pringle, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir John Pringle, 1st Baronet (10 April 1707 – 18 January 1782) was a British physician who has been called the &quot;father of military medicine&quot; (although Ambroise Paré and Jonathan Letterman have also been accorded this sobriquet).

==Biography==
===Youth and early career===
John Pringle was the youngest son of Sir John Pringle, 2nd Baronet, of Stichill, Roxburghshire (1662–1721), by his spouse Magdalen (d. December 1739), daughter of Sir Gilbert Eliott, 3rd Baronet, of Stobs.

He was educated at St Andrews, at Edinburgh, and at Leiden. In 1730 he graduated with a degree of Doctor of Physic at the last-named university, where he was an intimate friend of Gerard van Swieten and Albrecht von Haller.

He settled in Edinburgh at first as a physician, but between 1733 and 1744 was also Professor of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh University.

In 1742 he became physician to the Earl of Stair, then commanding the British army in Flanders. About the time of the battle of Dettingen in Bavaria in June 1743, when the British army was encamped at Aschaffenburg, Pringle, through the Earl of Stair, brought about an agreement with the Marshal of Noailles, the French commander, that military hospitals on both sides be considered as neutral, immune sanctuaries for the sick and wounded, and should be mutually protected. The International Red Cross, as constituted by the modern Geneva Conventions, developed from this conception and agreement.

In 1744 he was appointed by the Duke of Cumberland physician-general to the forces in the Low Countries. In 1749, having settled in a smart house in Pall Mall, London, he was made physician in ordinary to the Duke of Cumberland.

On 1 April 1752 he married Charlotte (d. Dec 1753) second daughter of Dr William Oliver (1695–1764) of Bath, the inventor of Bath Oliver biscuits, but they had no issue.

In 1760, he wrote an appreciation of the Life of General James Wolfe.

On 5 June 1766 John Pringle was created a baronet, and in 1774 he was appointed Physician to His Majesty King George III.

He was also a frequent travelling companion to Benjamin Franklin. The successful London bookseller Andrew Millar noted Pringle and Franklin as dinner guests at his home.

===Academia===
His first book, &quot;Observations on the Nature and Cure of Hospital and Jayl Fevers&quot;, was published in 1750, and in the same year he contributed to the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; of the Royal Society three papers on &quot;Experiments on Septic and Antiseptic Substances&quot;, which gained him the Copley Medal. Two years later he published his important work, &quot;Observations on the Diseases of the Army in Camp and Garrison&quot;, which entitles him to be regarded as the founder of modern military medicine.

In November 1772 he was elected President of the Royal Society, a position he held until 1778. In this capacity he delivered six discourses, which were afterwards collected into a single volume (1783).

In 1735, Pringle became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.

Pringle was a regular correspondent and friend of James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, the Scottish philosopher. Monboddo was an important thinker in pre-evolutionary theory, and some scholars actually credit him with the concept of evolution; however, Monboddo was also quite eccentric, which was one reason for Monboddo&#x27;s not receiving credit for the evolution concepts. It was in a letter to Pringle in 1773 that Monboddo revealed he did not really hold to a belief of men being born with tails, which was the chief point of his ridicule.

At the age of 73 he went, briefly, to Edinburgh in 1780, but returned to London in September 1781, and died in the following year.

==Legacy==
There is a monument to Pringle in Westminster Abbey, executed by Joseph Nollekens. At his death, his baronetcy became extinct.

After a legal case in 2004, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh was able to open to the public the Pringle papers that it holds.

<doc id="463385" wikidata="Q6467545" url="?curid=463385" title="Labour candidates and parties in Canada">
<text>There have been various groups in Canada that have nominated candidates under the label Labour Party or Independent Labour Party, or other variations from the 1870s until the 1960s. These were usually local or provincial groups using the Labour Party or Independent Labour Party name, backed by local labour councils made up of many union locals in a particular city, or individual trade unions. There was an attempt to create a national Canadian Labour Party in the late 1910s and in the 1920s, but these were only partly successful.

The Communist Party of Canada (CPC), formed in 1921, fulfilled some of labour&#x27;s political yearnings from coast to coast, and then the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) – Worker Farmer Socialist was formed in 1932. With organic ties to the organized labour movement, this was a labour party by definition. Prior to the CCFs formation in 1932, the Socialist Party of Canada was strong in British Columbia and in Alberta before World War I, while the Dominion Labour Party and the Canadian Labour Party were strong in Alberta through the 1920s and 1930s, and the Independent Labour Party led by J. S. Woodsworth was strong in Manitoba in the 1920s and 1930s.

An Edmonton-based Independent Labour Party ran candidates in the 1921 Alberta general election. It was independent in the sense that it was separate from the Edmonton Labour Council, which was dominated by international craft unions. Later, many of its proponents joined the CPC. A number of local Labour parties and clubs participated in the formation of the CPC in 1921. The Independent Labour Party (Manitoba), the Canadian Labour Party, the Dominion Labour Party, and other labour groups helped found the CCF in 1932.

==Members of Parliament==
The first Labour Member of Parliament (MP) was Arthur Puttee who founded the Winnipeg Labour Party, and was elected to the House of Commons from Winnipeg, Manitoba in a 1900 by-election and kept his seat at the 1900 federal election held later the same year. Other MPs elected under the Labour or Independent Labour label include:
*Ralph Smith, a miner, ran as an Independent Labour candidate in Vancouver in the 1900 federal election but took his seat in the Canadian House of Commons as a Liberal. He was subsequently re-elected as a Liberal in the 1904 and 1908 before being defeated in 1911.
*Alphonse Verville was elected as a Labour candidate in a 1906 by-election in Maisonneuve, Quebec. He was re-elected in 1908 and 1911. He grew close to the Liberals during his service as MP, and he ran and was re-elected as a Laurier Liberal in the 1917 federal election. 
* James Lockwood ran as a Labour party candidate in the 1917 federal election in Algoma West, but was defeated.
* John Wilfred Kennedy was elected as a United Farmers of Ontario-Labour MP for Glengarry and Stormont in a 1919 by-election. He was re-elected as a Progressive MP in the 1921 federal election and was defeated in 1925.
*William Irvine, a close friend of J.S. Woodsworth, represented the riding of East Calgary (Calgary East), Alberta as a Labour MP from 1921 to 1925. He also served as a United Farmers of Alberta MP for Wetaskiwin from 1926 to 1935, during which time he helped found the CCF. He sat as a CCF MP for Cariboo, British Columbia from 1945 to 1949.
*Joseph Shaw represented West Calgary (Calgary West), Alberta as a Labour MP from 1921 to 1925. (He later also sat as a Liberal MLA from 1926 to 1930.)
* Herbert Bealey Adshead was Labour MP for Calgary East from 1926 to 1930.
* Angus MacInnis was an Independent Labour Party MP from 1930 to 1935 and sat as a CCF MP from 1935; 
*A. A. Heaps was elected as a Labour MP for Winnipeg North in 1925, 1926 and 1930 and was re-elected as a CCFer in 1935; 
* J. S. Woodsworth founded the Manitoba Independent Labour Party in December 1920. He served as an MP from 1921 until his death in 1942, at first as an ILP MP, later as a CCF MP. He was the first leader of the CCF after its founding in 1932. 
*Humphrey Mitchell was elected as a Labour MP representing Hamilton East in a 1931 by-election. Close to William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s Liberals, he did not get along with other Labour and Independent Labour MPs and refused to join the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation when it was founded in 1932. The CCF ran a candidate against Mitchell in 1935 (the Liberals did not) and the vote split resulted in Mitchell&#x27;s defeat by the Conservative candidate. In 1941 he was appointed to the federal Cabinet as Minister of Labour and soon after returned to the House of Commons as a Liberal MP via a by-election in Welland.

MacInnis, Heaps and Woodsworth joined the Ginger Group of left wing MPs prior to forming the CCF. Alberta Labour MPs Irvine and Shaw, and its UFA MPs, also were in the Ginger Group.

==Members of provincial legislatures==

===In Nova Scotia===
Four Independent Labour Party (ILP) MLAs and one Farmer-Labour MLA (all but one from Cape Breton) were elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in the 1920 general election. They joined with six United Farmer MLAs to form the official opposition in the legislature with United Farmer MLA Daniel G. MacKenzie as leader. All the United Farmer and ILP MLAs were defeated in the 1925 general election. A single Labour MLA, Archibald Terris was elected in 1928 representing Cumberland County; he did not run for re-election in 1933.

*D. W. Morrison, ILP, (Cape Breton), 1920-1925
*Arthur R. Richardson, Farmer-Labour, (Cape Breton), 1920-1925
*Joseph Steele, ILP, (Cape Breton), 1920-1925
*Arthur Forman Waye, ILP, (Cape Breton), 1920-1925
*Archibald Terris, ILP, (Cumberland), 1920–1925, 1928-1933

The Nova Scotia Co-operative Commonwealth Federation began running candidates with the 1933 general election and became the New Democratic Party in 1961. In 1982 the Cape Breton Labour Party was formed by MLA Paul MacEwan after he was expelled from the NDP. It ran 14 candidates in the 1984 general election but MacEwan was the only candidate to win the seat. The party soon dissolved and MacEwan was re-elected in 1988 as an independent before joining the Nova Scotia Liberal Party in 1990.

===In Quebec===

A number of members of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec were labelled &quot;Parti ouvrier&quot; (Labour Party) from the 1890 election until the 1931 election. They represented predominantly labour-class neighbourhoods in Montreal and Quebec City and consisted of:

* Joseph Béland, MLA for the district of Montréal n°1 from 1890 to 1892;
* Joseph-Alphonse Langlois, MLA for Saint-Sauveur from 1909 to 1916;
* Aurèle Lacombe, MLA for Montréal-Dorion from 1919 to 1923;
* Adélard Laurendeau, MLA for Maisonneuve from 1919 to 1923;
* Joseph Gauthier, MLA for Montréal-Sainte-Marie from 1921 to 1923;
* Pierre Bertrand, MLA for Saint-Sauveur from 1923 to 1927;
* William Tremblay, MLA for Maisonneuve from 1927 to 1931;

===In Ontario===

*Daniel John O&#x27;Donoghue was the first Labour candidate elected to a Canadian legislature when in 1874 he was elected to the Ontario legislature as the candidate of the Ottawa Trades Council.
*Allan Studholme was elected the first Labour Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in the Ontario legislature in a 1906 by-election in Hamilton East. He remained in office until his death in 1919.

A number of Labour MLAs were elected in the 1919 provincial election which led to the formation of a United Farmers of Ontario-Labour coalition government. Labour MLAs included: 
*James Bertram Cunningham, Labour, Sault Ste Marie 
*John Govenlock, Labour, Huron Centre, (1919)
*Frank Greenlaw, Labour, St. Catharines, (1919)
*George Grant Halcrow, Labour, Hamilton East, (1919)
*Peter Heenan, Labour, Kenora, (1919, 1923, returned as Liberal 1934, 1937 see Liberal-Labour))
*Karl Homuth, Labour-UFO, Waterloo S., (1919, as Labour 1923, 1926, Conservative 1929, d. 1930)
*Morrison MacBride, Labour, Brantford (1919, 1923, returned as Independent 1934, Ind. Liberal 1937 d. 1938)
*Harry (Henry) Mills, Labour, Fort William, (1919)
*Walter Rollo, Labour, Hamilton W., (1919) Minister of Labour and leader of the Labour group in the legislature (1919-1923)
*Hugh Stevenson, Labour, London, (1919)
*Charles Swayze, Labour, Niagara Falls, (1919)
*Thomas Tooms, Labour, Peterborough W., (1919)

The last Labour MLA elected to the legislature was Earl Hutchinson who was elected in Kenora in 1929 and re-elected in 1934. He agreed to resign shortly after his re-election to allow former Labour MLA Peter Heenan to seek the Kenora seat in a by-election so that he could be appointed to the provincial cabinet by the newly elected Liberal government of Mitchell Hepburn. Hutchinson accepted an appointment by Hepburn to the post of vice-chairman of the Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Board shortly after leaving politics.

The Ontario Co-operative Commonwealth Federation was formed in 1932 with the support of a number of Independent Labour Party clubs and won its first seat in the 1934 provincial election, Samuel Lawrence in Hamilton East.

In 1944, two CCF MPPs, Arthur Nelson Alles (Essex North) and Leslie Hancock (Wellington South) left the CCF to sit as Independent Labour MPPs after the CCF rejected a proposal by the Communist Labor-Progressive Party to form a CCF-Liberal-LPP coalition to oust the Progressive Conservative government of George Drew. The two did not run in the 1945 Ontario general election and Alles was succeeded in Essex North by Alexander Parent, running as a Liberal-Labour candidate with the support of both the Liberal Party and the LPP. Parent initially joined the Liberal caucus but left in January 1946 in order to sit as a &quot;straight Labor representative&quot;, caucusing with Labor-Progressive MPPs J.B. Salsberg and A. A. MacLeod.

===In Manitoba===

*Reverend A. E. Smith was a Dominion Labour Party (DLP) MLA in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1920 to 1922. In 1925 he joined the Communist Party of Canada and was a prominent party leader until his death. 
*Fred Dixon was the DLP&#x27;s leader in the early 1920s and a Manitoba MLA from 1914 to 1923.

As well, Alberta Labour candidates, under the labels of the Dominion Labor Party and Canadian Labor Party, ran with some success at the civic level in Edmonton, Calgary, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge and coal-mining towns, such as Drumheller and Blairmore (which even elected a Communist Party-dominated town council in the 1930s).

===In British Columbia===

*Although there were no parties in the British Columbia legislature until 1903, various candidates began to declare for labour parties in the 1890s. In 1894 Robert Macpherson, running for the leftist Nationalist Party, won a seat in Vancouver City.
*The first to succeed, in the 1898 election, was Ralph Smith, in the coal-mining riding of South Nanaimo. Once the party system was introduced, Smith joined the Liberal Party and was re-elected as a Liberal in the 1903 and then won a seat as MP in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1904 and 1908 elections, but was defeated for his seat in the 1911. He returned to provincial politics and won his seat again as part of the province&#x27;s first Liberal government in the wake of the general election of 1916. He served as Finance Minister in that government until his death in 1917, and was succeeded by his wife, Mary Ellen Smith, who won the resulting by-election and sat as an Independent Liberal, later becoming the first female cabinet minister in the British Empire.
*Thomas Uphill was the Labour MLA for Fernie in the British Columbia Legislative Assembly from 1920 until 1960. He was elected as a Federated Labour Party candidate in the 1920 British Columbia general election, re-elected as part of the Canadian Labour Party slate in 1924 continued to run and win as an Independent Labour or Labour candidate rather than join the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation until his last victory in 1956. Uphill retired, undefeated, in 1960. From 1941 until 1952 the CCF unsuccessfully ran candidates against him. They did not stand against Uphill beginning in the 1953 election. The Labor-Progressive Party, with which Uphill had sympathies, never stood candidates against him.

==Parties ==

In 1917, the Trades and Labour Congress (TLC) national convention in Toronto passed a resolution calling on provincial labour federations to establish a political party which would unite socialist and labour parties in the province and eventually form a national party. A Canadian Labour Party was formed, and endorsed several candidates in the 1917 federal election. The leadership of the TLC changed in 1918, however, and the new leaders favoured the &quot;non-partisan&quot; approach of American Federation of Labor leader Samuel Gompers. The CLP was abandoned, as such.

Between 1920 and 1926, provincial parties (or provincial wings of national bodies) were founded in British Columbia, Manitoba, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec.

The Federated Labour Party was created by the British Columbia Federation of Labour in 1920, absorbing the Social Democratic Party and part of the Socialist Party of Canada.

From 1906 to 1909, there was a Canadian Labour Party of B.C. (CLP(BC)). This party was a split from and rival to a group calling itself the Independent Labour Party.

A later Independent Labour Party was organized in British Columbia in 1926 by the Federated Labour Party and Canadian Labour Party (B.C. section) branches. In 1928, it severed its CLP(BC) connections. In 1931, it reorganized, and was renamed the Independent Labour Party (Socialist). The following year it became the Socialist Party of Canada.

In Manitoba, a Dominion Labour Party (DLP) had been created in 1918. This was a reformist party, although more explicitly socialist than the previous such organizations in the province (see Winnipeg Labour Party, Manitoba Independent Labour Party, Manitoba Labour Party, Labour Representation Committee). The DLP elected several members to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in 1920. It was taken over by rightist elements affiliated with the American Federation of Labour later in the year, and most of the MLAs formed a new Independent Labour Party.

The Alberta wing of the Dominion Labour Party was formed in 1920. Unlike the Manitoba DLP, radicals did not lose control of this group. and it was not split by a radical-versus-reformist schism. It remained a viable organization until the 1930s, in an alliance with the Canadian Labour Party (see below). It elected a few MPs in Calgary in the 1921, 1925, 1926 and 1930 federal elections. Both the DLP and the CLP helped found the CCF in 1932.

In Saskatchewan, the Independent Labour Party was formed in 1931 and led by M.J. Coldwell, It merged with the United Farmers of Canada (Saskatchewan Section) to form the Farmer-Labour Group in 1932. This group became the Saskatchewan CCF in 1934.

The Ontario Labour Party was created in 1922, led by James Simpson of the Independent Labour Party, and the Reverend A. E. Smith, later of the Communist Party of Canada.

In 1921, Simpson also revived the Canadian Labour Party. The CLP was intended to be an umbrella organization for the various labour parties throughout the country. It formed alliances with the Federated Labour Party, Ontario Labour Party, Dominion Labour Party and other groups, including local labour councils, (although not with the Manitoba ILP). The Alberta wing of the CLP was founded in 1922. Between 1922 and 1924, the provincial and city branches of the Workers Party of Canada (the legal face of the Communist Party of Canada) also joined the CLP. It was never a strong central organization, however, and never elected a candidate at the national level. The CLP ceased to exist in most parts of the country after 1929, when the Communists withdrew. In Alberta, the CLP survived until 1942, in arms-length alliance with the Alberta Co-operative Commonwealth Federation after 1932.

==Liberal-Labour==

At various times in political history of Canada and of Ontario, candidates have sought election as Liberal-Labour candidates.

==Conservative Labour==
Conservative Labour was the label used by Conservative Party of Canada politician Henry Buckingham Witton as a candidate in Hamilton, Ontario from 1872 to 1875. Witton may have added &quot;Labour&quot; to the Conservative Party name because Hamilton is a largely industrial city. The first workingman ever to sit in parliament in Canada, Witton was elected largely on the strength of the Hamilton labour movement. Indeed, his candidacy was aided by workers throughout southern Ontario, as can be seen by the very supportive coverage he received in the (Toronto) &quot;Ontario Workman&quot;.

Witton was employed as a master painter at the Great Western Railway Shops when he was elected in the 1872 federal election, and sat with the Conservative caucus of Sir John A. Macdonald before being defeated in the 1874 election. He ran again in an 1875 by-election but was again defeated.

==Farmer-Labour==

Across Canada, labour and the farmers movements, particularly the United Farmers, formed alliances, and often ran joint candidates. The Progressive Party of Canada was effectively a coalition of farmer and labour groups.

John Wilfred Kennedy, a farmer, was elected as a United Farmers of Ontario-Labour MP for Glengarry and Stormont in a 1919 by-election. He was re-elected as a Progressive MP in the 1921 federal election and was defeated in 1925.

Agnes Macphail, who was first elected to the House of Commons as a Progressive, was re-elected in 1935 as a UFO-Labour candidate before being defeated in 1940. She was a supporter of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, but ran as UFO-Labour because the UFO, of which she was a member, had disaffiliated from the CCF in 1934 after a brief association.

A small number of candidates ran under the &quot;Farmer-Labour&quot; banner in federal elections of the 1930s and 1940s, although there was no organized party. None of these candidates ever won election to the House of Commons. One of these candidates was Beatrice Brigden who was the first Farmer-Labour candidate from Brandon, Manitoba. She ran in 1930, but was defeated by David Wilson Beaubier. Farmer-Labour co-operation would be enshrined as a guiding principle of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, founded in 1932, and of its successor, the NDP.

===Ontario===
Labour and Independent Labour Party Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) joined with members of the United Farmers of Ontario to form a Farmer-Labour coalition government from 1919 to 1923 with E. C. Drury as Premier of Ontario.

===Alberta===
The Labour MLAs elected in 1921 (six at the most at any one time) worked with the United Farmers of Alberta government during its 14 years in power, and one even sat as a cabinet minister in the UFA cabinet for five years.
Alberta&#x27;s Labour MPs and its UFA MPs, who together held all the Alberta seats from 1921 to 1925, were active in the Ginger Group.

===Saskatchewan===
The United Farmers and the Independent Labour Party merged to form the Farmer-Labour Group in 1932. In the 1934 provincial election, the Farmer-Labour Group won almost 24% of the popular vote and 5 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, where it became the official opposition to the Liberal government. After the election, it became the Saskatchewan section of the CCF.

===Nova Scotia===
Eleven United Farmers and Labour candidates were elected to the Nova Scotia Legislative Assembly in the 1920 general election forming the official opposition in the province.

===New Brunswick===
In the 1920 provincial election, nine United Farmers candidates and two Farmer-Labour candidates were elected to the legislature. They sat together and allowed the incumbent Liberals to maintain confidence in a minority government situation. None of the MLAs were re-elected in the 1925 election.

<text>The Socialist Party of Canada (SPC) was a political party that existed from 1904 to 1925, led by E. T. Kingsley. It published the newspaper, &quot;Western Clarion&quot;.

==History==

===Establishment===
The Socialist Party of Canada was founded at the Socialist Party of British Columbia&#x27;s fourth annual convention on December 30–31, 1904. Delegates at the convention were urged to consider organizing the nucleus of a federal party, noting the acceptance of the platform with socialist parties and organizations in other provinces. Socialist organizations quickly approved the party formation, and the new party executive met for the first time on February 19, 1905.

The party, which had a revolutionary Marxist orientation, called for the overturn of the capitalist system through militant political action. Given this goal, compromise through trade unionism and limited political reforms was rejected. 

=== Party manifesto and membership ===

The party&#x27;s manifesto, which went through five editions by 1920, was its most influential and widely read publication. The manifesto traced the history of class struggle and the exploitation of labour, concluding that:

Out of these conditions has arisen the Socialist Party of Canada, the nucleus of the revolt of the slaves of Canada against capitalism. Its policy is to educate the slaves of Canada to an understanding of their position and organize them for concerted political action, to the end that they may wrest the powers of State from the hands of capital, and use them to strip the master class of its property rights in the means of production and to make these the collective property of the producers.
The SPC platform similarly called for socialization of the means of production:

Therefore, we call upon all workers to organise under the banner of the Socialist Party of Canada with the object of conquering the public powers, for the purpose of setting up and enforcing the economic program of the working class as follows:

1. The transformation, as rapidly as possible, of capitalist property in the means of wealth production (natural resources, factories, mills, railroads, etc.) into the collective property of the working class.

2. The organisation and management of industry by the working class.

3. The establishment, as speedily as possible, of production for use instead of production for profit.
The SPC was structured as a network of local organizations, each conducting education and propaganda in their respective communities. Provincial-level executives coordinated these activities in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, and the Maritimes. The governing Dominion Executive Committee was headquartered in British Columbia and consisted almost entirely of BC residents. 

Although a national convention was never held, E.T. Kingsley was regarded as the movement&#x27;s leader until about 1912. The foremost exponent of Impossibilism, Kingsley called for a social revolution to redistribute wealth through political organization, education, and propaganda. 

While the party&#x27;s platform was Marxist, its membership was diverse. Besides Marxists, there were social democrats, militant trade unionists, and left-leaning federations of Ukrainians, Finns, Letts, and Jews. Ultimately, the varying factions did not coalesce and schisms occurred, including such breakaway formations as the Social Democratic Party of Canada and the Socialist Party of North America.

Nevertheless, the SPC was Canada&#x27;s third largest political party until the outbreak of the First World War. It also enjoyed some success at the provincial electoral level, with SPC deputies sponsoring legislation that addressed worker concerns such as health and safety.  
===Electoral participation===

The SPC was strongest in British Columbia where it won seats in the province&#x27;s legislature from 1903 to 1912. In the provincial election of 1907, the SPC garnered over 5,000 votes. The apex was the 1909 election, when it collected over 11,000 votes — about 22 percent of the total ballots cast in the seats contested. During this period, the leadership of the Vancouver Trades and Labor Council consisted of committed SPC members who also played a role in stymying efforts to establish a rival labour party. However, disappointing federal election results in 1911 and the resignation of the provincial house leader, J. H. Hawthornthwaite, over his involvement in land speculation, precipitated a decline. The two SPC deputies elected in the 1912 election defected to the Liberals in 1914.

In 1909, SPC member Charlie O&#x27;Brien was elected to the Alberta legislature.

In Manitoba, the Manitoba branch of the SPC was initially a rival to Winnipeg&#x27;s reform labour groups. It may also have been responsible for the defeat of centrist labour candidate Fred Dixon in the election of 1910. The resulting backlash from trade unions weakened the SPC for a number of years. In 1920, George Armstrong was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba on a United Labour list. However, he was defeated in 1922 due in part to opposition from communist politicians in the city.

===World War I and its aftermath===
The SPC paid a heavy price for its opposition to Canadian entry into the world war including harassment and intimidation from government authorities. Individual members were also targeted, including Ginger Goodwin, who died at the hands of police in 1918 while evading conscription. 

In the fall of 1918 &quot;Western Clarion&quot; was banned by the federal government. On January 11, 1919, a new publication called &quot;The Red Flag&quot; was launched by the SPC to work around the proscription of its predecessor. The first issue noted the state&#x27;s interference with the postal service and its censorship of party correspondence:
The official organ has been suppressed... Leaflets mailed have been confiscated and complaints ignored. Almost every letter which arrives at this office bears unmistakable signs of having been opened, though no censorship mark to that effect is on them. All such letters are unduly delayed, being some four, five and six weeks in the mails before delivery...

Moreover, letters and parcels which we have dispatched have failed to reach their destination. The mail of individual party members also suffers from the same despicable secret censorship. Our protests and complaints to heads of departments result only in officially equivocal and evasive replies.

The ban was lifted in 1920.

In the wake of the Russian Revolution and the Winnipeg General Strike, a number of the SPC&#x27;s supporters became attracted to Bolshevism and the ideas of Lenin and Trotsky. Others gravitated toward an evolutionary or gradualist socialist position.

SPC members, notably George Armstrong and William Pritchard, were among the strike leaders put on trial following the Winnipeg confrontation.

In 1919, SPC members, including Pritchard, were instrumental in founding One Big Union in Canada. 

In 1920, a split occurred when many of the party&#x27;s members left to join the Federated Labour Party, which had been formed by the British Columbia Federation of Labour. Others joined the labour and independent labour parties that were being formed across the country.

In 1921, most of the Marxist SPC members left to join the Workers Party, which was the public face of the nascent Communist Party of Canada.

In 1925, the Socialist Party of Canada formally disbanded. Many of the remaining members joined the Independent Labour Party.

<doc id="463391" wikidata="Q2992408" url="?curid=463391" title="Confederation of Regions Party of Canada">
<text>The Confederation of Regions Party (CoR) was a right-wing federal political party in Canada founded in 1984 by Elmer Knutson. It was founded as a successor to the Western Canada Federation (West-Fed), a non-partisan organization, to fight the Liberal Party of Canada. The CoR aimed to fill the void on the right of the political spectrum left by the decline of the Social Credit Party of Canada and the growing unpopularity among westerners of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada under the leadership of Brian Mulroney.

The party also attracted significant support as a protest vote against official bilingualism among some voters who were not necessarily ideologically opposed to mainstream Canadian political parties on other issues. The party proposed dividing Canada into four &#x27;regions&#x27;, western Canada, Atlantic Canada, Ontario and Quebec, each with an equal number of seats in the House of Commons of Canada.

In the 1984 federal election, it nominated 55 candidates, who won 65,655 votes in total, or 0.52% of the popular vote across the country. The party took 2.2% of the vote in Alberta and peaked with 6.7% in Manitoba.
In the 1988 federal election, its 51 candidates won 41,342 votes, 0.31% of the popular vote. One of its candidates was Paul Fromm, leader of the far-right groups Citizens for Foreign Aid Reform and Canadian Association for Free Expression. &quot;(See also: Confederation of Regions Party candidates, 1988 Canadian federal election)&quot;.

The party&#x27;s greatest success came in New Brunswick, where its provincial wing, the New Brunswick Confederation of Regions Party, held the status of official opposition from 1991 to 1995. After the demise of CoR, many former supporters joined the Reform Party of Canada.

==Provincial wings==

The CoR captured about 2% of the vote in provincial elections in the 1988 Manitoba election and the 1990 Ontario election.

===Alberta===

The CoR&#x27;s Alberta wing nominated candidates in the 1986 provincial election and the 1993 provincial election. In 1986, the party nominated six candidates, who won a total of 2,866 votes, or 0.40% of the total. In 1993, the party nominated 12 candidates, who won 3,556 votes, or 0.36% of the total.

On 17 June 1996, the Chief Electoral Officer of Alberta, cancelled the registration of the Confederation of Regions Party of Alberta and the party was struck from the Register of Alberta Political Parties because the party failed to comply with the registration requirements of the Election Finances and Contributions Disclosure Act. The COR Party was struck from the register because two conflicting groups in the party claimed different persons were officers of the party. The party presented different addresses of record. The conflicting groups had different interpretations of the COR Party Constitution. As the Chief Electoral Officer did not have the authority to resolve such issues, he referred the participants in the dispute to the courts. Neither side in the dispute applied to the courts in an effort to resolve the problem, and the party did not run any candidates 1997 election nor any election since.

==Party program==

The party program was set out in a website that aimed to re-establish CoR as a federal political party. Grammatical, punctuation and formatting errors have been left intact.

:COR wants to become a nationwide Federal Party, and wishes to represent all Canadians who want to live in a true democracy, restore Canada&#x27;s prosperity and rebuild its National Institutions.

:We want to become an egalitarian, populist party slightly to the right of center in the political spectrum

:We aspire to be the elected representative of all Canadians who embrace these views about their nation.

:A Canada that follows a policy of &quot;CANADA FIRST&quot;

:A Canada that practices true democracy, where individual rights are paramount, majority rule is applied, minorities are protected by law and all citizens are equal

:A Canada that teaches its people about their true history, celebrates their contributions, achievements and sacrifices and takes pride in its unique heritage and tradition

:A Canada that is viewed by all as a land of &quot;the true north, strong and free&quot;

:A Canada whose multi-racial and multi-cultural heritage is acknowledged but where Canadian nationality is neither divided or hyphenated and where one official language and one legal system based on common law serves to unite its people

:We believe that Canada has evolved into four economic, geographic, commercial and political regions which, has the potential to become one strong and united nation once Canadians have been allowed to draft and ratify a true Constitution for Canada at a constituent assemble of elected delegates.

:COR (whose name is derived from its belief) believes that in such a &quot;CONFEDERATION of REGIONS&quot; EACH REGION SHOULD BE FREE TO DEVELOP ITS POTENTIAL TO THE FULL WHILST COMPLEMENTING THE CANADIAN NATION AS A WHOLE

:We believe that during the last 25 years Canadians have been unable to change things because of the political and economic bankruptcy of old line parties who encourage the enshrinement of flawed vision of Canada&#x27;s future, a politically imposed Canadian Constitution, the greed of big business and the existence of an &quot;establishment&quot; consists of institutionalized elites who strive to retain power by maintaining the status quo and perpetuating myths about Canada&#x27;s past.

:Our goals have been shaped by events of our times such as the latest recession that our politicians were eventually obliged to acknowledge and the presence of an ever growing number of homeless and hungry Canadian men, women and children who are now walking the streets and roads of this land in search of personal pride and dignity and a restored sense of what is means to be a Canadian.

:Our policies have also been influenced by the cavalier attitude of the present government with regard to how its spends the taxpayer&#x27;s dollar, its contempt for the nation&#x27;s ever increasing national debt and its inability to address the rising unemployment that is eroding the foundations of Canadian society and which is now impacting negatively on Canadians from all walks of life.

:THE OVERRIDING GOAL OF THE POLICIES IS TO RESTORE CANADIAN PROSPERITY AND BUILD CANADIAN DEMOCRACY.

<doc id="463392" wikidata="Q7987651" url="?curid=463392" title="Western Canada Concept">
<text>The Western Canada Concept was a Western Canadian federal political party founded in 1980 to promote the separation of the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, and the Yukon and Northwest Territories (which included present-day Nunavut) from Canada in order to create a new nation.

The party argued that Western Canada could not receive fair treatment while the interests of Quebec and Ontario dominated Canadian politics. The party gained popularity in Alberta when western alienation was at its height following the federal Liberal government announcement of the National Energy Program in October 1980.

The most prominent leader of the party was Doug Christie, a British Columbia lawyer best known for having represented neo-Nazis James Keegstra, Ernst Zündel and Wolfgang Droege. To distance itself from Christie, the national party expelled him from the leadership in 1981 and denied him a membership in the party&#x27;s Alberta branch. He later became leader of British Columbia&#x27;s provincial branch of the party and ran for the party at the national and provincial levels several times. In 2005, he announced the creation of the Western Block Party which would be a western version of the &quot;Bloc Québécois&quot;.

At the time of his death in 2013, Christie maintained a website with the &quot;Western Canada Concept&quot; name; however, Western Canada Concept was no longer a registered political party.

==Provincial wings==
===Alberta===
The Alberta wing first ran for office in by-elections to the 19th Alberta Legislature. One member of the party, Gordon Kesler, was elected in a 1982 provincial by-election in Olds-Didsbury riding that drew national attention. Kesler became leader of the Alberta WCC with his election to the legislature. The best showing for the party came later in the same year in the 1982 Alberta general election, where they ran almost a full slate of candidates and took 11.8 per cent of the vote. But the party did not elect any MLAs, and Kesler lost his own seat.

In 1984, Kesler was replaced by Jack Ramsay, later a federal Reform Member of Parliament. Some of the more doctrinaire figures in the party opposed Ramsay&#x27;s leadership, claiming that he was not genuinely committed to western independence. The party ran 20 candidates in the 1986 Alberta general election, but won less than one percent of the popular vote.

In 1987, a group of Alberta members who were dissatisfied with the party&#x27;s leadership and direction left the party to establish the Western Independence Party.

===British Columbia===
In British Columbia, the party continued to exist far longer than in other provinces. It ran candidates from the early 1980s until the mid-2000s, under the leadership of Doug Christie. It never won a seat.

===Manitoba===
The Manitoba branch of the party only ran in the 1986 Manitoba general election and some by-elections, never winning a substantial portion of the votes. 

===Saskatchewan===
The Saskatchewan branch of the party attracted two sitting members of the Legislative Assembly who represented the party for a few months in 1986 before being kicked out of the party.

<text>In the Company of Men is a 1997 American black comedy film, written and directed by Neil LaBute and starring Aaron Eckhart, Matt Malloy, and Stacy Edwards. The film, which was adapted from a play written by LaBute and served as his feature film debut, won him the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay.

The film revolves around two male co-workers, Chad and Howard, who, angry and frustrated with women in general, plot to toy maliciously with the emotions of a deaf female subordinate. It was first written as a play, which debuted at Brigham Young University in December 1992, and received a 1993 Drama AML Award from the Association for Mormon Letters.

==Plot==
Chad and Howard are two middle management employees at a corporation, temporarily assigned to a branch office away from home for six weeks. Embittered by bad experiences with women, Chad and Howard form a mean-spirited revenge scheme to find an insecure woman, romance her simultaneously, and then break up with her at the same time. Chad is the originator and driving force behind the scheme, while Howard is the more passive of the two, which leads to a later conflict with the scheme.

Chad decides upon Christine, a deaf co-worker who is so self-conscious that she wears headphones so people, thinking that she is listening to music, are compelled to get her attention visually without immediately learning that she is deaf. Chad and Howard decide to each ask her out, and over the course of several weeks, date her simultaneously.

In the meantime, things with the project go wrong; a fax Chad is supposed to have made to the home office is &quot;lost&quot; and a presentation Chad is supposed to deliver to the home office is unable to be carried out successfully after some documents are allegedly printed so lightly that they are illegible. These mishaps culminate in Howard being demoted and Chad taking his place as the head of the project after Chad places the blame for the mishaps unfairly on Howard. Chad eventually sleeps with Christine, and she falls in love with him. When Christine eventually breaks this news to Howard, Howard tells Christine the truth about their scheme, and tells her that he loves her. Christine is shocked by the revelation, and refuses to believe that Chad would do this. When she confronts Chad, he admits the truth. Christine angrily slaps Chad, but Chad is unashamed of his behavior, and cruelly taunts Christine, who collapses into tears after he leaves her.

Weeks later, Howard confronts Chad back home at his apartment. Howard is now apparently in the bad graces of the company, having been moved to a lower floor, while Chad is doing well, and thus offering to say something on Howard&#x27;s behalf. Nevertheless, Howard is not worried about work; he confesses to Chad that he really loved Christine. At this point, Chad, despite having previously told Howard that his girlfriend, Suzanne, had left him, shows Howard that she is still there, asleep in his bed. Chad says that he carried out the plan &quot;because I could,&quot; and cruelly asks Howard how it feels to have truly hurt someone. Howard, who had never done anything like that before, leaves, horrified. He vomits down the stairwell.

Howard later travels back to the city and to a bank where he sees Christine working, and tries to speak to her, but she looks away in anger. He loudly pleads with her to &quot;listen&quot; to him, but his pleas literally fall on deaf ears.

==Cast==
* Aaron Eckhart as Chad
* Matt Malloy as Howard
* Stacy Edwards as Christine 
* Mark Rector as John
* Jason Dixie as Intern

==Themes==
&quot;In the Company of Men&quot; features several themes such as retro-sexism and role reversals. An example of role reversal is that in the beginning Howard plans with Chad to destroy an innocent young woman, yet by the end of the film Chad has &quot;destroyed&quot; Howard.

==Release==
&quot;In the Company of Men&quot; was screened in the Dramatic competition at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival and in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. Shortly after its premiere at Sundance, Alliance Independent Films acquired worldwide distribution rights outside North America to the film. In March 1997, Sony Pictures Classics acquired North American distribution rights to the film, beating out studios such as Fox Searchlight Pictures and Orion Pictures.

===Box office===
&quot;In the Company of Men&quot; opened in a limited release in eight theaters in the United States on August 1, 1997, and grossed $100,006, with an average of $12,500 per theater. The film&#x27;s widest release was 108 theaters, earning $2,804,473.

===Critical reception===
The film received very positive reviews from critics and has a score of 89% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 56 reviews with an average rating of 7.90/10. The critical consensus states &quot;Neil LaBute&#x27;s pitch-black comedy is a masterful exploration of male insecurity, and it&#x27;s elevated by a breakout performance by Aaron Eckhart as a businessman who likes to play psychological games.&quot; The film also has a score of 81 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 25 critics. In January 1998, it was included on Siskel and Ebert&#x27;s &quot;Best Films of 1997&quot; episode.

==== Retrospective lists ====
The character of Chad was also nominated by the American Film Institute for their list of AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains, but did not make it into the top 100.

&quot;In the Company of Men&quot; was listed on Empire&#x27;s 500 Greatest films of all time at number 493.

===Accolades===
==Home media==
The DVD of the film contains two commentary tracks, one with director Neil LaBute, and the other with stars Aaron Eckhart, Matt Malloy, and Stacy Edwards.

<text>The Grey Party of Canada was a political party in Canada. The party was a protest movement started by senior citizens who want to make views known on specific issues including tax credits for seniors, saving Medicare, and free medications for seniors.

The Grey Party was founded in January 2002 by Jim Webb of New Brunswick, who once ran federally for the Confederation of Regions Party in Saint John, New Brunswick and twice for the New Brunswick Confederation of Regions Party in the provincial riding of Saint John Lancaster.

In the 2003 New Brunswick general election, the party nominated 10 candidates in the province&#x27;s 55 ridings, including 23-year-old Mark LeBlanc who ran in the riding of Saint John Kings. At the time, having a 23-year-old candidate for a senior-focused party was a newsmaker. Grey Party candidates received 1,550 votes (0.4% of the popular vote).

The party was deregistered by Elections New Brunswick on October 22, 2004.

<doc id="463404" wikidata="Q580943" url="?curid=463404" title="Nitzer Ebb">
<text>Nitzer Ebb () are an English EBM group formed in 1982 by Essex school friends Vaughan &quot;Bon&quot; Harris (programming, synthesizers, drums, vocals), Douglas McCarthy (vocals), and David Gooday (drums). The band were originally named La Comédie De La Mort but soon discarded that and chose the name Nitzer Ebb by cutting up words and letters and arranging them randomly to create something Germanic without using actual German words.

==History==

=== Initial releases (1983–1987) ===
The group released their demo &quot;Basic Pain Procedure&quot; in 1983, but it was two years until they met PWL producer Phil Harding, who produced their 1985 debut single &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Funny How Your Body Works?&quot; and helped them set up their own label, Power Of Voice Communications. The band at the time was inspired by the post-punk scene and specifically acts like &quot;Siouxsie and the Banshees, Killing Joke and Bauhaus who were having a big influence on us, in some ways stylistically but also in the energy that they gave&quot;.

They released three more singles on their own label, &quot;Warsaw Ghetto&quot; (1985), &quot;Warsaw Ghetto Remixes&quot; (1986) and &quot;Let Your Body Learn&quot; (1986), before signing to Mute Records in 1986. The singles &quot;Murderous&quot; (1986) and &quot;Let Your Body Learn&quot; (1987) followed, building their reputation in the Industrial Rock and EBM scenes, as well as making inroads into the developing Chicago House scene.

&quot;Join In The Chant&quot; (1987) became part of the Balearic beat scene that influenced the UK acid house scene.

===International success, disbandment (1987–1995)===
Their debut album &quot;That Total Age&quot; was released in 1987. Depeche Mode, longtime friends and label mates of the band, invited them to open for the European leg of their successful Music For The Masses Tour in 1987. 

David Gooday left after the tour and they completed their next album &quot;Belief&quot; (1989) as a duo. Mark &#x27;Flood&#x27; Ellis became their new producer. They recruited Julian Beeston to assist them on their own world tour, and he soon became a regular contributor both on and off stage.

In 1989, they teamed with German EBM pioneers Die Krupps to rerecord their 1981 single &quot;Wahre Arbeit - Wahrer Lohn&quot; as &quot;The Machineries of Joy&quot;.

The third Nitzer Ebb album &quot;Showtime&quot;, released in 1990, revealed a less confrontational sound. The single &quot;Fun to Be Had&quot; (1990) featured a remix by George Clinton and was a hit on the US dance chart. 

Their fourth album, &quot;Ebbhead&quot; (1991), showcased a more traditional songwriting style with an emphasis on melodic choruses was produced by Alan Wilder from Depeche Mode and Flood. They promoted the album with a global tour that took them from the southern U.S. to northern Siberia (in the Siberian city of Barnaul).

Their fifth album, &quot;Big Hit&quot; (1995), featured a greater use of &#x27;real&#x27; instruments, especially guitars and drums. McCarthy and Harris recruited Jason Payne (percussion), to their main line-up and brought in John Napier (guitar, percussion) to assist with live performances.

&quot;Big Hit&quot; was the final release by the band for almost 15 years. McCarthy was a regular collaborator with Alan Wilder&#x27;s Recoil project, and he records with French electronic producer Terence Fixmer as Fixmer/McCarthy. Bon Harris moved to Los Angeles, where he became a successful producer and recorded as 13mg and as a member of Maven.

===Reunion (2006–present)===

Nitzer Ebb began work on new material in Los Angeles in early 2007, with a retrospective documentary still in the pipeline. During 2007, Nitzer Ebb continued its trend of replacing drummers as Kourtney Klein left the band to be replaced by Jason Payne. A first track, &quot;Once You Say&quot;, with Depeche Mode songwriter Martin L. Gore on backing vocals, was played in June 2007 by Dave Clarke in his White Noise show on VPRO&#x27;s 3 Voor 12. This track, along with &quot;Payroll&quot;, were debuted live as Nitzer Ebb played a handful of shows and festivals during 2007. These tracks were then featured on Nitzer Ebb&#x27;s album, &quot;Industrial Complex&quot;.

McCarthy and Harris reunited up with Jason Payne and producer Flood to finish up the first new Nitzer Ebb record in over a decade. In the meantime, &quot;Fixmer/McCarthy&quot; released its second album in June 2008, &quot;Into the Night&quot;.

The band announced a US tour for fall–winter 2009 and were selected as the opening act of the January and February European and Russian dates of Depeche Mode&#x27;s Tour of the Universe in 2010.

In 2019, the band announced a North American tour that included the original band members David Gooday and Simon Granger. In 2021, the band continued more tour dates including in Europe.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Harris and McCarthy got together to work on a side project called D-R-A-G.

In November 2021, McCarthy collapsed before a show in Palm Beach, Florida and had to go to the hospital. The band emphasized it was due to complications from a pre-existing illness and it had nothing to do with COVID-19. The band went on to perform with Harris on lead vocals.

==Influences and legacy==
The single &quot;Murderous&quot; has been sampled by other electronic music acts, such as Information Society (on &quot;Now That I Have You&quot;) and Kode IV (on &quot;Success&quot;). Nitzer Ebb&#x27;s early tracks also made inroads to techno culture, notably in Richie Hawtin&#x27;s 1999 DJ mix, &quot;Decks, EFX &amp; 909&quot;.

<doc id="463407" wikidata="Q910386" url="?curid=463407" title="Taxiway">
<text>A taxiway is a path for aircraft at an airport connecting runways with aprons, hangars, terminals and other facilities. They mostly have a hard surface such as asphalt or concrete, although smaller general aviation airports sometimes use gravel or grass.

Most airports do not have a specific speed limit for taxiing (though some do). There is a general rule on safe speed based on obstacles. Operators and aircraft manufacturers might have limits. Typical taxi speeds are 20–30 knots (37–56 km/h; 23–35 mph).

== High-speed exit ==
Busy airports typically construct high-speed or rapid-exit taxiways to allow aircraft to leave the runway at higher speeds. This allows the aircraft to vacate the runway quicker, permitting another to land or take off in a shorter interval of time. This is accomplished by reducing the angle the exiting taxiway intercepts the runway at to 30 degrees, instead of 90 degrees, thus increasing the speed at which the aircraft can exit the runway onto the taxiway.

==Markings==
*Normal Centerline A single continuous yellow line, in width.
*Enhanced Centerline The enhanced taxiway center line marking consists of a parallel line of yellow dashes on either side of the taxiway centerline. Taxiway centerlines are enhanced for 150 feet (46 m) before a runway holding position marking. The enhanced taxiway centerline is standard at all FAR Part 139 certified airports in the US.
*Taxiway Edge Markings Used to define the edge of the taxiway when the edge does not correspond with the edge of the pavement. 
**Continuous markings consist of a continuous double yellow line, with each line being at least in width, spaced apart. They divide the taxiway edge from the shoulder or some other abutting paved surface not intended for use by aircraft. 
**Dashed markings define the edge of a taxiway on a paved surface where the adjoining pavement to the taxiway edge is intended for use by aircraft, e.g., an apron. These markings consist of a broken double yellow line, with each line being at least in width, spaced apart (edge to edge). These lines are 15 feet (4.6 m) in length with 25 foot (7.6 m) gaps. 
*Taxi Shoulder Markings Taxiways, holding bays, and aprons are sometimes provided with paved shoulders to prevent blast and water erosion. Shoulders are not intended for use by aircraft, and may be unable to carry the aircraft load. Taxiway shoulder markings are yellow lines perpendicular to the taxiway edge, from taxiway edge to pavement edge, about 3 metres.
*Surface Painted Taxiway Direction Signs Yellow background with a black inscription, provided when it is not possible to provide taxiway direction signs at intersections, or when necessary to supplement such signs. These markings are located on either side of the taxiway.
*Surface Painted Location Signs Black background with a yellow inscription and yellow and black border. Where necessary, these markings supplement location signs located alongside the taxiway and assist the pilot in confirming the designation of the taxiway on which the aircraft is located. These markings are located on the right side of the centerline.
*Geographic Position Markings These markings are located at points along low visibility taxi routes (when Runway visual range is below 1200 feet (370 m)). They are positioned to the left of the taxiway centerline in the direction of taxiing. Black inscription centered on pink circle with black inner and white outer ring. If the pavement is a light colour then the border is white with a black outer ring.

* Runway Holding Position Markings These show where an aircraft should stop when approaching a runway from a taxiway. They consist of four yellow lines, two solid and two dashed, spaced six or twelve inches (15 or 30 cm) apart, and extending across the width of the taxiway or runway. The solid lines are always on the side where the aircraft is to hold. There are three locations where runway holding position markings are encountered: Runway holding position markings on taxiways; runway holding position markings on runways; taxiways located in runway approach areas.
* Holding Position Markings for Instrument Landing System (ILS) These consist of two yellow solid lines spaced two feet (60 cm) apart connected by pairs of solid lines spaced ten feet (3 metres) apart extending across the width of the taxiway.
* Holding Position Markings for Taxiway/Taxiway Intersections These consist of a single dashed line extending across the width of the taxiway.
* Surface Painted Holding Position Signs Red background signs with a white inscription to supplement the signs located at the holding position.

The taxiways are given alphanumeric identification. These taxiway IDs are shown on black and yellow signboards along the taxiways.

==Signs==

Airport guidance signs provide direction and information to taxiing aircraft and airport vehicles. Smaller airports may have few or no signs, relying instead on airport diagrams and charts.

There are two classes of signage at airports, with several types of each:
=== Operational guidance signs ===
*Location signs – yellow on black background. Identifies the runway or taxiway the aircraft is currently on or is entering.
*Direction/Runway exit signs – black on yellow. Identifies the intersecting taxiways the aircraft is approaching, with an arrow indicating the direction to turn.
*Destination signs – black on yellow, similar to the direction signs. They indicate a destination at the airport and always have an arrow showing the direction of the taxi route to that destination. When the inscription for two or more destinations having a common taxi route are placed on a sign, the destinations are separated by an interpunct (•) and only one arrow is used.
*Stop Bar signs – white on blue background. The designation consists of the letter S followed by designation of the taxiway on which the Stop Bar is positioned. This sign is not standard.
*Other – many airports use conventional traffic signs such as stop and yield signs throughout the airport.
===Mandatory instruction signs===
Mandatory instruction signs are white on red. They show entrances to runways or critical areas. Vehicles and aircraft are required to stop at these signs until the control tower gives clearance to proceed.

*Runway signs – White text on a red background. These signs identify a runway intersection ahead, e.g., runway 12-30 in the photo above.
*Frequency change signs – Usually a stop sign and an instruction to change to another frequency. These signs are used at airports with different areas of ground control.
*Holding position signs – A single solid yellow bar across a taxiway indicates a position where ground control may require a stop. If two solid yellow bars and two dashed yellow bars are encountered, this indicates a holding position for a runway intersection ahead; runway holding lines must never be crossed without permission. At some airports, a line of red lights across a taxiway is used during low visibility operations to indicate holding positions. An &quot;interrupted ladder&quot; type marking with an &quot;ILS&quot; sign in white on red indicates a holding position before an ILS critical area.

==Lights==
For night operations, taxiways at major airports are equipped with lights, although many small airports are not equipped with taxiway lighting.

*Taxiway Edge Lights: used to outline the edges of taxiways during periods of darkness or restricted visibility conditions. These fixtures may be elevated or in-pavement and emit blue light normally. Where a four-way intersection crosses, the light at the centre of the crossing may be omnidirectional and emit yellow light. Where a road for ground vehicles only meets a taxiway or at an end of usable service area for a ramp or taxiway, the light at the edge of the road or the final taxiway edge light may emit red light. Taxiway edge lights are spaced at a minimum of 50 to a maximum of 200 feet apart. On straightaways, the spacing is typically 200 feet. These lights can be closer together at taxiway intersections.
*Taxiway Centerline Lights: They are steady burning and emit green light located along the taxiway centerline. Where a taxiway crosses a runway, or where a &quot;lead-off&quot; taxiway centreline leads off of a runway to join a taxiway, these lights will alternate yellow and green. Taxiway Centerline Lights are spaced at either 50 or 100 foot intervals depending on the minimum authorized visibility. On curved taxiway segments, Taxiway Centerline Lights may be required to be closer together.
*Clearance Bar Lights: Three in-pavement steady-burning yellow lights installed at holding positions on taxiways
*Runway Guard Lights: Either a pair of elevated flashing yellow lights installed on either side of the taxiway, or a row of in-pavement yellow lights installed across the entire taxiway, at the runway holding position marking at taxiway/runway intersections. 
*Stop Bar Lights: A row of red, unidirectional, steady-burning in-pavement lights installed across the entire taxiway at the runway holding position, and elevated steady-burning red lights on each side used in low visibility conditions (below 1,200 ft RVR). A controlled stop bar is operated in conjunction with the taxiway centerline lead-on lights which extend from the stop bar toward the runway. Following the ATC clearance to proceed, the stop bar is turned off and the lead-on lights are turned on.

<text>The mechanical structure of an aircraft is known as the airframe. This structure is typically considered to include the fuselage, undercarriage, empennage and wings, and excludes the propulsion system.

Airframe design is a field of aerospace engineering that combines aerodynamics, materials technology and manufacturing methods with a focus on weight, strength and aerodynamic drag, as well as reliability and cost.

==History==

Modern airframe history began in the United States during the Wright Flyer&#x27;s maiden flight, showing the potential of fixed-wing designs in aircraft.

In 1912 the Deperdussin Monocoque pioneered the light, strong and streamlined monocoque fuselage formed of thin plywood layers over a circular frame, achieving .

=== First World War ===
Many early developments were spurred by military needs during World War I. Well known aircraft from that era include the Dutch designer Anthony Fokker&#x27;s combat aircraft for the German Empire&#x27;s , and U.S. Curtiss flying boats and the German/Austrian Taube monoplanes. These used hybrid wood and metal structures.

By the 1915/16 timeframe, the German Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft firm had devised a fully monocoque all-wood structure with only a skeletal internal frame, using strips of plywood laboriously &quot;wrapped&quot; in a diagonal fashion in up to four layers, around concrete male molds in &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; halves, known as &quot;Wickelrumpf&quot; (wrapped-body) construction - this first appeared on the 1916 LFG Roland C.II, and would later be licensed to Pfalz Flugzeugwerke for its D-series biplane fighters.

In 1916 the German Albatros D.III biplane fighters featured semi-monocoque fuselages with load-bearing plywood skin panels glued to longitudinal longerons and bulkheads; it was replaced by the prevalent stressed skin structural configuration as metal replaced wood. Similar methods to the Albatros firm&#x27;s concept were used by both Hannoversche Waggonfabrik for their light two-seat CL.II through CL.V designs, and by Siemens-Schuckert for their later Siemens-Schuckert D.III and higher-performance D.IV biplane fighter designs. The Albatros D.III construction was of much less complexity than the patented LFG &quot;Wickelrumpf&quot; concept for their outer skinning.

German engineer Hugo Junkers first flew all-metal airframes in 1915 with the all-metal, cantilever-wing, stressed-skin monoplane Junkers J 1 made of steel. It developed further with lighter weight duralumin, invented by Alfred Wilm in Germany before the war; in the airframe of the Junkers D.I of 1918, whose techniques were adopted almost unchanged after the war by both American engineer William Bushnell Stout and Soviet aerospace engineer Andrei Tupolev, proving to be useful for aircraft up to 60 meters in wingspan by the 1930s.

=== Between World wars ===

The J 1 of 1915, and the D.I fighter of 1918, were followed in 1919 by the first all-metal transport aircraft, the Junkers F.13 made of Duralumin as the D.I had been; 300 were built, along with the first four-engine, all-metal passenger aircraft, the sole Zeppelin-Staaken E-4/20. Commercial aircraft development during the 1920s and 1930s focused on monoplane designs using Radial engines. Some were produced as single copies or in small quantity such as the Spirit of St. Louis flown across the Atlantic by Charles Lindbergh in 1927. William Stout designed the all-metal Ford Trimotors in 1926.

The Hall XFH naval fighter prototype flown in 1929 was the first aircraft with a riveted metal fuselage : an aluminium skin over steel tubing, Hall also pioneered flush rivets and butt joints between skin panels in the Hall PH flying boat also flying in 1929. Based on the Italian Savoia-Marchetti S.56, the 1931 Budd BB-1 Pioneer experimental flying boat was constructed of corrosion-resistant stainless steel assembled with newly developed spot welding by U.S. railcar maker Budd Company.

The original Junkers corrugated duralumin-covered airframe philosophy culminated in the 1932-origin Junkers Ju 52 trimotor airliner, used throughout World War II by the Nazi German Luftwaffe for transport and paratroop needs. Andrei Tupolev&#x27;s designs in Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union designed a series of all-metal aircraft of steadily increasing size culminating in the largest aircraft of its era, the eight-engined Tupolev ANT-20 in 1934, and Donald Douglas&#x27; firms developed the iconic Douglas DC-3 twin-engined airliner in 1936. They were among the most successful designs to emerge from the era through the use of all-metal airframes.

In 1937, the Lockheed XC-35 was specifically constructed with cabin pressurization to undergo extensive high-altitude flight tests, paving the way for the Boeing 307 Stratoliner, which would be the first aircraft with a pressurized cabin to enter commercial service.

=== Second World War ===
During World War II, military needs again dominated airframe designs. Among the best known were the US C-47 Skytrain, B-17 Flying Fortress, B-25 Mitchell and P-38 Lightning, and British Vickers Wellington that used a geodesic construction method, and Avro Lancaster, all revamps of original designs from the 1930s. The first jets were produced during the war but not made in large quantity.

Due to wartime scarcity of aluminium, the de Havilland Mosquito fighter-bomber was built from wood—plywood facings bonded to a balsawood core and formed using molds to produce monocoque structures, leading to the development of metal-to-metal bonding used later for the de Havilland Comet and Fokker F27 and F28.

=== Postwar ===

Postwar commercial airframe design focused on airliners, on turboprop engines, and then on jet engines. The generally higher speeds and tensile stresses of turboprops and jets were major challenges. Newly developed aluminium alloys with copper, magnesium and zinc were critical to these designs.

Flown in 1952 and designed to cruise at Mach 2 where skin friction required its heat resistance, the Douglas X-3 Stiletto was the first titanium aircraft but it was underpowered and barely supersonic; the Mach 3.2 Lockheed A-12 and SR-71 were also mainly titanium, as was the cancelled Boeing 2707 Mach 2.7 supersonic transport.

Because heat-resistant titanium is hard to weld and difficult to work with, welded nickel steel was used for the Mach 2.8 Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 fighter, first flown in 1964; and the Mach 3.1 North American XB-70 Valkyrie used brazed stainless steel honeycomb panels and titanium but was cancelled by the time it flew in 1964.

A computer-aided design system was developed in 1969 for the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, which first flew in 1974 alongside the Grumman F-14 Tomcat and both used boron fiber composites in the tails; less expensive carbon fiber reinforced polymer were used for wing skins on the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II, F/A-18 Hornet and Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit.

=== Modern era ===

The vertical stabilizer of the Airbus A310-300, first flown in 1985, was the first carbon-fiber primary structure used in a commercial aircraft; composites are increasingly used since in Airbus airliners: the horizontal stabilizer of the A320 in 1987 and A330/A340 in 1994, and the center wing-box and aft fuselage of the A380 in 2005.

The Cirrus SR20, type certificated in 1998, was the first widely produced general aviation aircraft manufactured with all-composite construction, followed by several other light aircraft in the 2000s.

The Boeing 787, first flown in 2009, was the first commercial aircraft with 50% of its structure weight made of carbon-fiber composites, along with 20% aluminium and 15% titanium: the material allows for a lower-drag, higher wing aspect ratio and higher cabin pressurization; the competing Airbus A350, flown in 2013, is 53% carbon-fiber by structure weight. It has a one-piece carbon fiber fuselage, said to replace &quot;1,200 sheets of aluminium and 40,000 rivets.&quot;

The 2013 Bombardier CSeries have a dry-fiber resin transfer infusion wing with a lightweight aluminium-lithium alloy fuselage for damage resistance and repairability, a combination which could be used for future narrow-body aircraft. In 2016, the Cirrus Vision SF50 became the first certified light jet made entirely from carbon-fiber composites.

In February 2017, Airbus installed a 3D printing machine for titanium aircraft structural parts using electron beam additive manufacturing from Sciaky, Inc.

== Safety ==

Airframe production has become an exacting process. Manufacturers operate under strict quality control and government regulations. Departures from established standards become objects of major concern.

A landmark in aeronautical design, the world&#x27;s first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet, first flew in 1949. Early models suffered from catastrophic airframe metal fatigue, causing a series of widely publicised accidents. The Royal Aircraft Establishment investigation at Farnborough Airport founded the science of aircraft crash reconstruction. After 3000 pressurisation cycles in a specially constructed pressure chamber, airframe failure was found to be due to stress concentration, a consequence of the square shaped windows. The windows had been engineered to be glued and riveted, but had been punch riveted only. Unlike drill riveting, the imperfect nature of the hole created by punch riveting may cause the start of fatigue cracks around the rivet.

The Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop, first flown in 1957 became a costly lesson in controlling oscillation and planning around metal fatigue. Its 1959 crash of Braniff Flight 542 showed the difficulties that the airframe industry and its airline customers can experience when adopting new technology.

The incident bears comparison with the Airbus A300 crash on takeoff of the American Airlines Flight 587 in 2001, after its vertical stabilizer broke away from the fuselage, called attention to operation, maintenance and design issues involving composite materials that are used in many recent airframes. The A300 had experienced other structural problems but none of this magnitude.

==Alloys for airframe components==
As the twentieth century progressed, aluminum became an essential metal in aircraft. The cylinder block of the engine that powered the Wright brothers’ plane at Kitty Hawk in 1903 was a one-piece casting in an aluminum alloy containing 8% copper; aluminum propeller blades appeared as early as 1907; and aluminum covers, seats, cowlings, cast brackets, and similar parts were common by the beginning of the First World War. In 1916, L. Brequet designed a reconnaissance bomber that marked the initial use of aluminum in the working structure of an airplane. By war’s end, the Allies and Germany employed aluminum alloys for the structural framework of fuselage and wing assemblies.

The aircraft airframe has been the most demanding application for aluminum alloys; to chronicle the development of the high-strength alloys is also to record the development of airframes. Duralumin, the first high-strength, heat treatable aluminum alloy, was employed initially for the framework of rigid airships, by Germany and the Allies during World War I. Duralumin was an aluminum-copper-magnesium alloy; it was originated in Germany and developed in the United States as Alloy 17S-T (2017-T4). It was utilized primarily as sheet and plate.

Alloy 7075-T6 (70,000-psi yield strength), an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy, was introduced in 1943. Since then, most aircraft structures have been specified in alloys of this type. The first aircraft designed in 7075-T6 was the Navy’s P2V patrol bomber. A higher-strength alloy in the same series, 7178-T6 (78,000-psi yield strength), was developed in 1951; it has not generally displaced 7075-T6, which has superior fracture toughness.

Alloy 7178-T6 is used primarily in structural members where performance is critical under compressive loading.

Alloy 7079-T6 was introduced in the United States in 1954. In forged sections over 3 in. thick, it provides higher strength and greater transverse ductility than 7075-T6. It now is available in sheet, plate, extrusions, and forgings.

Alloy X7080-T7, with higher resistance to stress corrosion than 7079-T6, is being developed for thick parts. Because it is relatively insensitive to quenching rate, good strengths with low quenching stresses can be produced in thick sections.

Cladding of aluminum alloys was developed initially to increase the corrosion resistance of 2017-T4 sheet and thus to reduce aluminum aircraft maintenance requirements. The coating on 2017 sheet - and later on 2024-T3 - consisted of commercial-purity aluminum metallurgically bonded to one or both surfaces of the sheet.

Electrolytic protection, present under wet or moist conditions, is based on the appreciably higher electrode potential of commercial-purity aluminum compared to alloy 2017 or 2024 in the T3 or T4 temper. When 7075-T6 and other Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys appeared, an aluminum-zinc cladding alloy 7072 was developed to provide a relative electrode potential sufficient to protect the new strong alloys.

However, the high-performance aircraft designed since 1945 have made extensive use of skin structures machined from thick plate and extrusions, precluding the use of alclad exterior skins. Maintenance requirements increased as a result, and these stimulated research and development programs seeking higher-strength alloys with improved resistance to corrosion without cladding.

Aluminum alloy castings traditionally have been used in nonstructural airplane hardware, such as pulley brackets, quadrants, doublers, clips and ducts. They also have been employed extensively in complex valve bodies of hydraulic control systems. The philosophy of some aircraft manufacturers still is to specify castings only in places where failure of the part cannot cause loss of the airplane. Redundancy in cable and hydraulic control systems permits the use of castings.

Casting technology has made great advances in the last decade. Time-honored alloys such as 355 and 356 have been modified to produce higher levels of strength and ductility. New alloys such as 354, A356, A357, 359 and Tens 50 were developed for premium-strength castings. The high strength is accompanied by enhanced structural integrity and performance reliability.

Electric resistance spot and seam welding are used to join secondary structures, such as fairings, engine cowls, and doublers, to bulkheads and skins. Difficulties in quality control have resulted in low utilization of electric resistance welding for primary structure.

Ultrasonic welding offers some economic and quality-control advantages for production joining, particularly for thin sheet. However, the method has not yet been developed extensively in the aerospace industry.

Adhesive bonding is a common method of joining in both primary and secondary structures. Its selection is dependent on the design philosophy of the aircraft manufacturer. It has proven satisfactory in attaching stiffeners, such as hat sections to sheet, and face sheets to honeycomb cores. Also, adhesive bonding has withstood adverse exposures such as sea-water immersion and atmospheres.

Fusion welded aluminum primary structures in airplanes are virtually nonexistent, because the high-strength alloys utilized have low weldability and low weld-joint efficiencies. Some of the alloys, such as 2024-T4, also have their corrosion resistance lowered in the heat-affected zone if left in the as-welded condition.

The improved welding processes and higher-strength weldable alloys developed during the past decade offer new possibilities for welded primary structures. For example, the weldability and strength of alloys 2219 and 7039, and the brazeability and strength of X7005, open new avenues for design and manufacture of aircraft structures.

==Light aircraft==
Light aircraft have airframes primarily of all-aluminum semi-monocoque construction, however, a few light planes have tubular truss load-carrying construction with fabric or aluminum skin, or both.
Aluminum skin is normally of the minimum practical thickness: 0.015 to 0.025 in. Although design strength requirements are relatively low, the skin needs moderately high yield strength and hardness to minimize ground damage from stones, debris, mechanics’ tools, and general handling. Other primary factors involved in selecting an alloy for this application are corrosion resistance, cost, and appearance. Alloys 6061-T6 and alclad 2024-T3 are the primary choices.

Skin sheet on light airplanes of recent design and construction generally is alclad 2024-T3. The internal structure comprises stringers, spars, bulkheads, chord members, and various attaching fittings made of aluminum extrusions, formed sheet, forgings, and castings.

The alloys most used for extruded members are 2024-T4 for sections less than 0.125 in. thick and for general application, and 2014-T6 for thicker, more highly stressed sections. Alloy 6061-T6 has considerable application for extrusions requiring thin sections and excellent corrosion resistance. Alloy 2014-T6 is the primary forging alloy, especially for landing gear and hydraulic cylinders. Alloy 6061-T6 and its forging counterpart 6151-T6 often are utilized in miscellaneous fittings for reasons of economy and increased corrosion performance, when the parts are not highly stressed.

Alloys 356-T6 and A356-T6 are the primary casting alloys employed for brackets, bellcranks, pulleys, and various fittings. Wheels are produced in these alloys as permanent mold or sand castings. Die castings in alloy A380 also are satisfactory for wheels for light aircraft.

For low-stressed structure in light aircraft, alloys 3003-H12, H14, and H16; 5052-O, H32, H34, and H36; and 6061-T4 and T6 are sometimes employed. These alloys are also primary selections for fuel, lubricating oil, and hydraulic oil tanks, piping, and instrument tubing and brackets, especially where welding is required. Alloys 3003, 6061, and 6951 are utilized extensively in brazed heat exchangers and hydraulic accessories. Recently developed alloys, such as 5086, 5454, 5456, 6070, and the new weldable aluminum-magnesium-zinc alloys, offer strength advantages over those previously mentioned.

Sheet assembly of light aircraft is accomplished predominantly with rivets of alloys 2017-T4, 2117-T4, or 2024-T4. Self-tapping sheet metal screws are available in aluminum alloys, but cadmium-plated steel screws are employed more commonly to obtain higher shear strength and driveability. Alloy 2024-T4 with an anodic coating is standard for aluminum screws, bolts, and nuts made to military specifications. Alloy 6262-T9, however, is superior for nuts, because of its virtual immunity to stress-corrosion cracking.

<text>The Fartown Ground or just simply Fartown is a sports ground located in the Huddersfield suburb of Fartown in West Yorkshire, England and is predominantly famous for being the home ground of Huddersfield Rugby League Club from 1878 to 1992. The grounds consisted of a rugby ground, a cricket ground used by Yorkshire County Cricket Club, Bowling greens and a running track as well as a pavilion. It was the scene of many great games, including the Challenge Cup finals of 1908 and 1910, several Challenge Cup semi finals, John Player Cup finals and international matches.

Although the stands were all demolished, the pitch, floodlights and bankings where the terraces once stood are still there, Huddersfield RLFC played their last game there on 23 August 1992, up until the mid 2000s the club&#x27;s junior and reserves sides still played on the pitch at Fartown but the stands were already demolished by then. The ground had fallen into serious decline in the 1980s, The Main stand was closed in 1986 due to safety issues after the Bradford City stadium fire in 1985 and partly reopened in 1989, a large chunk of the terrace side was condemned and never reopened, the supporters club building was demolished in 2009 after a fire.

It also hosted an FA Cup semi final game between Blackburn Rovers and Sheffield Wednesday in 1882.

Huddersfield are still known as &quot;Fartown&quot; or &quot;the Fartowners&quot; by many of their older supporters. The highest attendance at the stadium to watch a Huddersfield game was 32,912 against Wigan on 4 March 1950, although a Challenge Cup semi-final played 19 April 1947 attracted a crowd of 35,136.

==History==
The ground was originally known as the St John&#x27;s Ground, after Huddersfield St John&#x27;s Cricket Club who became its original occupants in 1868, the ground had previously been owned by the proprietor of the George Hotel in Huddersfield.

In 1875 St John&#x27;s Cricket Club merged with Huddersfield Athletic Club to form the Huddersfield Cricket and Athletic Club. The name of the stadium was also changed to Fartown Grounds.

Although the athletic club had formed a rugby football section in 1867, Fartown was initially used for athletics festivals alterations made in the summer of 1878 meant that rugby could begin at the start of the 1878–79 season with the visit of Manchester Rangers on 2 November. The venue quickly became synonymous with Huddersfield RLFC.

Senior football was played at Fartown just once, an FA Cup semi final in 1882, organised as part of an attempt by the Football Association to promote the game of association football in what was, at the time, a predominantly rugby focused town. Blackburn Rovers drew 0–0 with Sheffield Wednesday, forcing a replay at Fallowfield in Manchester. Blackburn eventually won 5–1, and went on to lose 1–0 in the final to Old Etonians.

On 10 April 1882 (Easter Monday), the North of England v South of England men&#x27;s Lacrosse match was played at the Fartown ground, with the North winning 2–0, &quot;in the presence of a large number of spectators&quot;. (see match report: &#x27;Athletic News&#x27; 12 April 1882).

The Challenge Cup finals of 1908 and 1910 were played at Fartown with a replay at the ground required in 1910.

On 11 August 1943 an exhibition baseball game was staged between two teams of American soldiers which attracted 2,400 curious spectators.

In March 1973 the ground hosted its first John Player Trophy final, 10,102 spectators saw Leeds beat Salford 12–7. Leeds would feature in 2 semi finals a decade later, in December 1982, Leeds beat Widnes 8–2 in front of 7,247 fans and a year later the Loiners would beat Leigh 18–11 in front of 5,740 fans in what was the ground&#x27;s last major fixture.

The ground hosted its last Challenge Cup semi final in April 1976 when St Helens narrowly beat Keighley 5–4 in front of a crowd of 9,829.

The 1980s saw the stadium decline rapidly as Huddersfield RLFC struggled to pull in spectators. The main stand was closed due to storm damage in 1986. A new board of directors took over in 1989 when and injected some much needed financial resources into the club. As well as beginning to improve the playing staff, the new owners also carried out a considerable amount of work on the Fartown stadium and by the end of the 1989–90 season significant progress was being made.

Huddersfield RLFC moved to Huddersfield Town F.C.&#x27;s Leeds Road stadium in 1992, and then to the McAlpine Stadium in 1994, although they continued to use Fartown as a training base until 2004. The ground is now rather dilapidated, and is only used for staging amateur rugby league games.

==Cricket==
The rugby ground was adjoined by a cricket field, once considered to be the finest wicket in Yorkshire. A total of 76 first-class and 9 list A one-day matches were played on the pitch, the first on 28 August 1873 when Yorkshire played Nottinghamshire, and the last on 17 August 1955, when Yorkshire defeated Gloucestershire by 67 runs.

Yorkshire also played games against the touring Australians and South Africans at Fartown and an England XI played the Australians there in 1884. The first county one day game played there was held on 1 June 1969 in the Player&#x27;s County League against Sussex while the last came on 9 May 1982 in the John Player League when Yorkshire played Worcestershire.

Yorkshire&#x27;s highest score at Fartown was the 579 for 6 declared they accumulated against Glamorgan in 1925 while Middlesex scored 527 in 1887. Worcestershire were dismissed for 24 in 1903 while Yorkshire were humiliated for 31 by Essex in 1935. AJ Webbe scored an unbeaten 243 in Middlesex&#x27;s run spree in 1887 while the prolific Percy Holmes scored 220 not out for the Tykes against Warwickshire in 1922. A.W. Mold took 9 for 41 for Lancashire in a Roses Match in 1890 while CT Spencer took 9 for 63 for Leicestershire in 1954.

==Rugby League Test Matches==
The list of international rugby league matches played at Fartown is.

==Rugby League Tour Matches==
Fartown also saw Huddersfield, the county team Yorkshire and a Northern Rugby Football Union select side play host to international touring teams from Australia (sometimes playing as Australasia) and New Zealand from 1907 to 1973.

Huddersfield also faced Australia in the first game of their 1992 Rugby League World Cup final tour, losing 66–2 at the Leeds Road ground on 9 October 1992.

<text>The king rail (Rallus elegans) is a waterbird, the largest North American rail.

==Description==

Distinct features are a long bill with a slight downward curve, with adults being brown on the back and rusty-brown on the face and breast with a dark brown cap. They also have a white throat and a light belly with barred flanks. Undertail coverts are white and are displayed by the male during courtship. Immature birds are covered in down, with light brown on the head and darker brown on the back and wings.

This bird&#x27;s call is a low repeated grunt transcribed as &quot;kek-kek-kek&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
This bird breeds in marshes in eastern North America. Birds along the southeastern coasts of the United States are permanent residents. Other birds migrate to the southern United States and Mexico; in Canada, they are found in southern Ontario. An adult king rail will molt completely after nesting and it becomes flightless for almost a month.

==Ecology==
This bird is diurnal, contrasting with its smaller, nocturnal relatives.

===Breeding===
The nest is a raised platform built with marsh vegetation and covered by a canopy. This is to hide the eggs of this bird from predators that are searching from above.

The king rail interbreeds with the clapper rail (&quot;Rallus crepitans&quot;) where their ranges overlap; It can be argued that these two birds belong to the same species according to the biological species concept.
The king rail lays a clutch of 6 to 14 pale buff eggs with brown spotting. They usually measure . Both parents incubate the eggs for 21 to 23 days. When the eggs hatch, the young are covered in down and are able to leave the nest. They are not able to feed themselves, though, and thus must rely on their parents for food for up to six weeks after they hatch.

===Feeding===
This rail forages in shallow water near cover and eats mainly aquatic insects and crustaceans. It forages by probing the mud while moving around in shallow water.

The chicks are fed small arthropod prey by their parents. The prey is transferred from one parent&#x27;s beak to that of the chick.

Males often give food to whomever they pursue during courtship.

==Status==
These birds are still common in some coastal areas, although interior populations have declined due to habitat loss. In Michigan, it is considered a legally protected state endangered species, at an imperiled level.

<text>Nerekhta () is a town in Kostroma Oblast, Russia. Population: 

==History==
The first historical record of the town is in the records of Pereslavl-Suzdal Monastery in 1214. The town does not retain many marks of antiquity, apart from several 17th-century churches. It has been known for its textiles since the 19th century.

== Etymology ==
The town is named after a river on which it&#x27;s located. There are several other rivers named Nerekhta in central Russia, and this hydronym is believed to come from a substrate Finno-Ugric language (cf. &#x27;cape, foreland&#x27;). The reconstruction &quot;*(i)ne-(j)еr-еxta&quot; (&#x27;river of a big lake&#x27;) is viewed by Aleksandr Matveyev as unconvincing, since there are no big lakes within the basins of any rivers named Nerekhta.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Nerekhta serves as the administrative center of Nerekhtsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of oblast significance of Nerekhta—an administrative unit with a status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Nerekhta is incorporated within Nerekhtsky Municipal District as Nerekhta Urban Settlement.

==Transportation==
Railway lines connect the town to Yaroslavl, Kostroma, and Ivanovo.

==Sports==
The bandy club Start plays in a recreational league. It will participate in the Russian Rink Bandy Cup 2017.

<doc id="463425" wikidata="Q2592" url="?curid=463425" title="Kostroma">
<text>Kostroma (, ) is a historic city and the administrative center of Kostroma Oblast, Russia. A part of the Golden Ring of Russian cities, it is located at the confluence of the rivers Volga and Kostroma. In the 2021 census, the population is 267,481.

==History==
===Under the Rurikids===
The official founding year of the city is 1152 by Yury Dolgoruky. Since many scholars believe that early Eastern Slavs tribes arrived in modern-day Belarus, Ukraine and western Russia AD 400 to 600, Kostroma could be much older than previously thought.

The city has the same name as the East Slavic goddess Kostroma.

Like other towns of the Eastern Rus, Kostroma was sacked by the Mongols in 1238. It then constituted a small principality, under leadership of Prince Vasily of Kostroma, a younger brother of the famous Alexander Nevsky. Upon inheriting the grand ducal title in 1271, Vasily didn&#x27;t leave the town for Vladimir, and his descendants ruled Kostroma for another half a century, until the town was bought by Ivan I of Moscow.

As one of the northernmost towns of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, Kostroma served for grand dukes as a place of retreat when enemies besieged Moscow in 1382, 1408, and 1433. In 1375, the town was looted by Novgorod pirates (&quot;ushkuiniks&quot;). The spectacular growth of the city in the 16th century may be attributed to the establishment of trade connections with English and Dutch merchants (Muscovy Company) through the northern port of Archangel. Boris Godunov had the Ipatiev and Epiphany monasteries rebuilt in stone. The construction works were finished just in time for the city to witness some of the most dramatic events of the Time of Troubles.

The heroic peasant Ivan Susanin became a symbol of the city&#x27;s resistance to foreign invaders; several monuments to him may be seen in Kostroma. The future Tsar, Mikhail Romanov, also lived at the monastery. It was here that an embassy from Moscow offered him the Russian crown in 1612.

===Under the Romanovs===
A wooden house of Mikhail Romanov is still preserved in the monastery. There are also several old wooden structures transported to the monastery walls from distant districts of the Kostroma Oblast.
In 1773, Kostroma was devastated by a great fire. Afterwards the city was rebuilt with streets radiating from a single focal point near the river. They say that Catherine the Great dropped her fan on the city map, and told the architects to follow her design. One of the best preserved examples of the 18th century town planning, Kostroma retains some elegant structures in a &quot;provincial neoclassical&quot; style. These include a governor&#x27;s palace, a fire tower, a rotunda on the Volga embankment, and an arcaded central market with a merchant church in the center.

===During and after the Russian Revolution===
The First Workers&#x27; Socialist Club based in Kostroma was one of the best documented workers&#x27; clubs run by Proletkult. Organised around the principle of a &quot;public hearth&quot; (obshchestvennyi ochag) this club combined both practical support for workers in need of accommodation, food or furniture, as well as providing a focus for popular education.

===Nuclear power referendum===
The Nuclear Power Referendum was arranged in 1990 in the Kostroma area. 90% of the voting population were against nuclear power in the area. A Kostroma Nuclear Power Plant has been proposed.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Kostroma is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Kostromskoy District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the city of oblast significance of Kostroma—an administrative unit with a status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Kostroma is incorporated as Kostroma Urban Okrug.

==Geography==
The city is located at the confluence of the rivers Volga and Kostroma.

===Climate===
Kostroma has a continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;). It has long, very cold winters and short warm summers.
== Sights and landmarks ==

Built in 1559–1565, the five-domed Epiphany Cathedral was the first stone edifice in the city; its medieval frescoes perished during a fire several years ago. The minster houses the city&#x27;s most precious relic, a 10th-century Byzantine icon called Our Lady of St. Theodore. It was with this icon that Mikhail Romanov was blessed by his mother when he left for Moscow to claim the Russian throne. They say that just before the Revolution of 1917, the icon blackened so badly that the image was hardly visible; it was interpreted as a bad sign for the Romanov dynasty.

The Ipatyevsky monastery survives mostly intact, with its 16th-century walls, towers, belfry, and the 17th-century cathedral.

Apart from the monasteries, most of the city churches were either rebuilt or demolished during the Soviet years. The only city church that survives from the 17th-century &quot;golden age&quot; is the Resurrection church on the Lowlands (Russian: церковь Воскресения на Дебре). As the story goes, the church was commissioned by one merchant who ordered in England ten barrels of dye but received ten barrels of gold instead. He resolved that the unearned gold was the devil&#x27;s gift and decided to spend it on building a church. Two other 17th-century temples, of rather conventional architecture, may be seen on the opposite side of the Volga.

Among the vestiges of the Godunov rule, a fine tent-like church in the urban-type settlement of Krasnoye-na-Volge (formerly an estate of Boris Godunov&#x27;s brother) may be recommended.

==Transportation==
The city is served by the Kostroma Airport. Since 1887 there has been a railway connection between Kostroma and Moscow.

<doc id="463429" wikidata="Q462148" url="?curid=463429" title="Ultra Vivid Scene">
<text>Ultra Vivid Scene was an American alternative rock band, started by Kurt Ralske.

== Background ==
Former Nothing But Happiness and Crash guitarist Ralske started Ultra Vivid Scene in 1987, was signed to 4AD Records in 1988, and released his first UVS EP, &quot;She Screamed&quot;, in 1988. The debut album &quot;Ultra Vivid Scene&quot; released October 1988, was written, produced and performed entirely by Ralske, whose influences include The Velvet Underground and The Jesus and Mary Chain. The second album, &quot;Joy 1967-1990&quot;, was released in April 1990. The same month they played their first tour dates in the United Kingdom. 

The last album, &quot;Rev&quot;, was released in October 1992, and was performed by a band comprising Julius Klepacz (drums) and Jack Daley (bass) with Ralske on vocals and guitar. This album was picked up by the Chaos imprint of Columbia Records (Sony Music Distribution) during the time rival Warner Bros. was having some success with its imprints&#x27; 4AD relationships (4AD/Sire, 4AD/Elektra, 4AD/Reprise). 

As a live act, Ultra Vivid Scene performed only a handful of US dates in support of the first album in 1989. The second album in 1990 was supported by one month of touring in Europe and two months in the US. 1993 saw one month of US tour dates for the third and final album.

Ralske has gone on to do solo work, and has also produced albums for such artists as Rasputina, Ivy and Charles Douglas. His last known musical endeavor was his 2001 solo release &quot;Amor 0 + 01&quot;. Since that time, Ralske has worked as a visual artist.

===Videos===

In the &quot;Mercy Seat&quot; video, a young Moby appears playing the guitar, as he performed with the group at the time that single was released.

The 1990 video for the song &quot;Special One&quot; featured guest singer Kim Deal from Pixies.

<text>The Kostroma () is a river in the European part of Russia. It flows through the Kostroma and Yaroslavl Oblasts, and becomes a left tributary of the Volga, which it enters at the Gorky Reservoir, at the city of Kostroma.

Prior to the flooding of the Gorky Reservoir in 1955-1957, the Kostroma River flowed into the Volga within the city limits of Kostroma. The Ipatiev Monastery stands at the old confluence of the Kostroma and the Volga.

The river is long, and its drainage basin covers . The average water flow is at the town of Buy, from the mouth, and at the mouth

Major tributaries include the Vocha, Mezenda, Vyoksa, Tyobza, and Shacha on the left, and the Shugoma, Svetitsa, Selma, Monza, and Obnora on the right. Before the establishment of the Gorky Reservoir, the Sot and Mesa were also tributaries; they now flow directly into the reservoir.

The towns of Soligalich and Buy stand on the river.

The Kostroma freezes up in November and thaws in April or early May.

The Kostroma begins near the village of Knyazhevo Chuhlomskogo in the Kostroma Oblast. The upper river is relatively narrow and winding, but it soon gathers the water of many tributaries, increasing its width to about or . In the upper and middle reaches of the riverbed there are rapids, and the banks are often wooded and sometimes steep. Here it is suitable for swimming due to the large amount of snags and debris.

By the time it flows past the town of Buy, the width of the river exceeds ; from this point on the river is navigable. From here down to the reservoir it begins to form large bends and oxbow lakes, and sometimes floods.

The last of the Kostroma&#x27;s course form the border between the Yaroslavl and Kostroma oblasts.

== Etymology ==
The river bears the name of the Slavic goddess Kostroma.

<text>The Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL) is an implementation of the POSIX Threads specification for the Linux operating system.

==History==
Before the 2.6 version of the Linux kernel, processes were the schedulable entities, and there were no special facilities for threads.
However, it did have a system call — — which creates a copy of the calling process where the copy shares the address space of the caller. The LinuxThreads project used this system call to provide kernel-level threads (most of the previous thread implementations in Linux worked entirely in userland). Unfortunately, it only partially complied with POSIX, particularly in the areas of signal handling, scheduling, and inter-process synchronization primitives.

To improve upon LinuxThreads, it was clear that some kernel support and a new threading library would be required. Two competing projects were started to address the requirement: NGPT (Next Generation POSIX Threads) worked on by a team which included developers from IBM, and NPTL by developers at Red Hat. The NGPT team collaborated closely with the NPTL team and combined the best features of both implementations into NPTL. The NGPT project was subsequently abandoned in mid-2003 after merging its best features into NPTL.

NPTL was first released in Red Hat Linux 9. Old-style Linux POSIX threading is known for having trouble with threads that refuse to yield to the system occasionally, because it does not take the opportunity to preempt them when it arises, something that Windows was known to do better at the time. Red Hat claimed that NPTL fixed this problem in an article on the Java website about Java on Red Hat Linux 9.

NPTL has been part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux since version 3, and in the Linux kernel since version 2.6. It is now a fully integrated part of the GNU C Library.

There exists a tracing tool for NPTL, called POSIX Thread Trace Tool (PTT). And an Open POSIX Test Suite (OPTS) was written for testing the NPTL library against the POSIX standard.

==Design==
Like LinuxThreads, NPTL is a 1:1 threads library. Threads created by the library (via &quot;pthread_create&quot;) correspond one-to-one with schedulable entities in the kernel (&quot;processes&quot;, in the Linux case). This is the simplest of the three threading models (1:1, N:1, and M:N). New threads are created with the clone() system call called through the NPTL library. NPTL relies on kernel support for futexes to more efficiently implement user-space locks.

<doc id="463434" wikidata="Q230415" url="?curid=463434" title="Judith Anderson">
<text>Dame Frances Margaret Anderson (10 February 18973 January 1992), known professionally as Judith Anderson, was an Australian actress who had a successful career in stage, film, and television. 

A pre-eminent stage actress in her era, she won two Emmy Awards and a Tony Award, and was also nominated for a Grammy Award and an Academy Award. She is considered one of the 20th century&#x27;s greatest classical stage actors.

==Early life==
Frances Margaret Anderson was born in 1897 in Adelaide, South Australia, the youngest of four children born to Jessie Margaret (née Saltmarsh; 19 October 1862 – 24 November 1950), a former nurse, and Scottish-born James Anderson Anderson, a sharebroker and pioneering prospector.

She attended a private school, Norwood, where her education ended before graduation.

==Career==
===Early acting===
She made her professional debut (as Francee Anderson) in 1915, playing Stephanie at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, in &quot;A Royal Divorce&quot;. Leading the company was Scottish actor Julius Knight, whom she later credited with laying the foundations of her acting skills. She appeared alongside him in adaptations of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, &quot;Monsieur Beacauire&quot;, and &quot;David Garrick&quot;. In 1917, she toured New Zealand.

===Early years in America===
Anderson was ambitious and wanted to leave Australia. Most local actors went to London, but the war made this difficult, so she decided on the US. She travelled to California, but was unsuccessful for four months, then moved to New York, with an equal lack of success.

After a period of poverty and illness, she found work with the Emma Bunting Stock Company at the Fourteenth Street Theatre in 1918–19. She then toured with other stock companies.

===Broadway and film===
She made her Broadway debut in &quot;Up the Stairs&quot; (1922) followed by &quot;The Crooked Square&quot; (1923), and she went to Chicago with &quot;Patches&quot; (1923). She appeared in &quot;Peter Weston&quot; (1923), which only had a short run.

One year later, she had changed her acting forename (albeit not for legal purposes) to Judith and had her first triumph with the play &quot;Cobra&quot; (1924) co-starring Louis Calhern, which ran for 35 performances. Anderson then went on to &quot;The Dove&quot; (1925), which went on for 101 performances and really established her on Broadway.

She toured Australia in 1927 with three plays: &quot;Tea for Three&quot;, &quot;The Green Hat&quot;, and &quot;Cobra&quot;. Back on Broadway, she was in &quot;Behold the Bridegroom&quot; (1927–28) by George Kelly, and had the lead role in &quot;Anna&quot; (1928). She replaced Lynn Fontanne during the successful run of &quot;Strange Interlude&quot; (1929).

Anderson made her film debut in a short for Warner Bros., &quot;Madame of the Jury&quot; (1930). She made her feature-film debut with a role in &quot;Blood Money&quot; (1933).

In 1931, she played the Unknown Woman in the American premiere of Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;As You Desire Me&quot;, which ran for 142 performances. (It was filmed the following year with Greta Garbo in the same role.) She was in a short-lived revival of &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; (1932), then did &quot;Firebird&quot; (1932), &quot;Conquest&quot;, &quot;The Drums Begin&quot; (both 1933), and &quot;The Mask and the Face&quot; (1933, with Humphrey Bogart). Anderson then focused on Broadway with &quot;Come of Age&quot; (1934) and &quot;Divided By Three&quot; (1934).

===Broadway star===
She had a big hit with the lead in Zoe Akins&#x27; &quot;The Old Maid&quot; (1935) from the novel by Edith Wharton, in the role later played on film by Miriam Hopkins. It ran for 305 performances.

In 1936, Anderson played Gertrude to John Gielgud&#x27;s Hamlet in a production that featured Lillian Gish as Ophelia. In 1937, she joined the Old Vic Company in London and played Lady Macbeth opposite Laurence Olivier in a production by Michel Saint-Denis, at the Old Vic and the New Theatre.

She returned to Broadway with &quot;Family Portrait&quot; (1939), which she adored, but only it had a short run. She later toured in the show.

===&quot;Rebecca&quot;===
Anderson then received a career boost when she was cast in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940). As the housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, she was required to mentally torment the young bride, the &quot;second Mrs. de Winter&quot; (Joan Fontaine), even encouraging her to commit suicide, and to taunt her husband (Laurence Olivier) with the memory of his first wife, the never-seen &quot;Rebecca&quot; of the title. The film was a huge critical and commercial success, and Anderson was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the 13th Academy Awards.

===1940s===

Anderson was second billed in an Eddie Cantor comedy, &quot;Forty Little Mothers&quot; (1940) at MGM. She stayed at that studio for &quot;Free and Easy&quot; (1941), then went over to RKO to play the title role in &quot;Lady Scarface&quot; (1941).

In 1941, she played Lady Macbeth again in New York City opposite Maurice Evans in a production staged by Margaret Webster, a role she was to reprise with Evans on television, firstly in 1954 and then again in 1960 (the second version was released as a feature film in Europe). This ran for 131 performances.

Anderson made her appearance in Robinson Jeffers&#x27; &quot;The Tower Beyond Tragedy&quot; at the outdoor Forest Theater in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, on July 2–5, 1941. This was the first time it played in a professional manner. John Burr&#x27;s &quot;Carmel Pine Cone&quot; review admired Anderson&#x27;s performance and proclaimed the production was “an unqualified success.&quot; Director Charles O&#x27;Neal persuaded Anderson to appear in both &quot;The Tower Beyond Tragedy&quot; and the &quot;Family Portrait.&quot;

She returned to films to make four movies at Warner Bros.: &quot;All Through the Night&quot; and &quot;Kings Row&quot; (both 1942), and &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; (both 1943).

In 1942–43, on stage she played Olga in Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot;, in a production, which also featured Katharine Cornell, Ruth Gordon, Edmund Gwenn, Dennis King, and Alexander Knox. (Kirk Douglas, playing an orderly, made his Broadway debut in the production.) It ran for 123 performances. The production was so illustrious, it was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;.

Anderson returned to Hollywood to appear in &quot;Laura&quot; (1944). She briefly returned to Australia to tour American army camps. She was back in Hollywood to appear in &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (1945), &quot;The Diary of a Chambermaid&quot; (1946), and &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot; (1946). Anderson had rare top billing in &quot;Specter of the Rose&quot; (1946), written and directed by Ben Hecht. She returned to support roles for &quot;Pursued&quot; (1947), &quot;The Red House&quot; (1947), and &quot;Tycoon&quot; (1947).

===&quot;Medea&quot;===
In 1947, she triumphed as Medea in a version of Euripides&#x27; eponymous tragedy, written by poet Robinson Jeffers and produced by John Gielgud, who played Jason. She was a friend of Jeffers and a frequent visitor to his home Tor House in Carmel. She won the Tony Award for Best Actress for her performance. The show ran for 214 performances. Anderson then toured throughout the country with it.

===1950s===
On the big screen, Anderson played a golddigger in Anthony Mann&#x27;s Western &quot;The Furies&quot; (1950) and made her TV debut in a 1951 adaptation of &quot;The Silver Cord&quot; for &quot;Pulitzer Prize Playhouse&quot;. She guest-starred on TV shows such as &quot;The Billy Rose Show&quot; and &quot;Somerset Maugham TV Theatre&quot;.

She returned to Broadway with &quot;The Tower Beyond Tragedy&quot; by Jeffers (1950), and toured &quot;Medea&quot; in German in 1951. She was in a New York revival of &quot;Come of Age&quot; in 1952. She was Herodias in &quot;Salome&quot; (1953) and played in &quot;Black Chiffon&quot; on &quot;The Motorola Television Hour&quot;.

In 1953, she was directed by Charles Laughton in his own adaptation of Stephen Vincent Benét&#x27;s &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; with a cast also featuring Raymond Massey and Tyrone Power. Then, she did &quot;In the Summer House&quot; (1953–54) on Broadway.
On television, she was in &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1954) with Maurice Evans, for which she won an Emmy Award for Best Actress in a Single Performance, and &quot;The Elgin Hour&quot;. She was in several episodes of &quot;The Star and the Story&quot; and an episode of &quot;Climax! &quot;, as well as playing Memnet in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s epic &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956).

In 1955, she toured Australia with &quot;Medea&quot;. In 1956, she was in a production of &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; for &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot;.

Anderson appeared in a 1958 adaptation of &quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot; for &quot;The DuPont Show of the Month&quot; and played the memorable role of Big Mama, alongside Burl Ives as Big Daddy, in the screen adaptation of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s play, &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1958). She followed it with a return to Broadway, in the short-lived &quot;Comes a Day&quot; by Speed Lampkin (1958). &quot;I don&#x27;t profess to know much about films&quot;, she said around this time. &quot;I seldom see one.&quot;

Anderson reprised her performance as &quot;Medea&quot; for TV in 1959; in the same year, she appeared in a small-screen adaptation of &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; with Laurence Olivier. She had a role in the &quot;Wagon Train&quot; episode &quot;The Felizia Kingdom Story&quot;, and appeared in several episodes of &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; and one of &quot;Our American Heritage&quot;. 

===1960s===
In 1960, she played Madame Arkadina in Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; first at the Edinburgh Festival, and then at the Old Vic, with Tom Courtenay, Cyril Luckham and Tony Britton.

That year she also performed in &quot;Cradle Song&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot; (both 1960) for TV. She won The Emmy Award for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, for once again playing Lady MacBeth. She had support roles in &quot;Cinderfella&quot; (1960) and &quot;Why Bother to Knock&quot; (1961).

In 1961, she toured an evening in which she performed &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Medea&quot; and &quot;Tower&quot;. Anderson was in &quot;The Ghost of Sierra de Cobre&quot; (1964) for TV.

In 1966 ,she did a performance on stage in &quot;Elizabeth the Queen&quot;, which received poor reviews.

She received acclaim for her lead performance in a TV version of &quot;Elizabeth the Queen&quot; (1968, with Charlton Heston). She followed it with &quot;The File on Devlin&quot; (1969) and &quot;A Man Called Horse&quot; (1970). The latter was her first feature since &quot;Why Bother to Knock&quot;.

In 1970, she realised a long-held ambition to play the title role of &quot;Hamlet&quot; on a national tour of the United States and at New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall.

==Spoken word and radio==
She also recorded many spoken-word record albums for Caedmon Audio from the 1950s to the 1970s, including scenes from &quot;Macbeth&quot; with Maurice Anderson (Victor, in 1941), an adaption of &quot;Medea&quot;, Robert Louis Stevenson verses, and readings from the Bible. She received a Grammy nomination for her work on the &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; recording.

;Radio broadcasts
==Return to Australia==
Anderson returned briefly to Australia. She guest-starred in &quot;Matlock Police&quot; and was in the film &quot;Inn of the Damned&quot; (1974).

Her other credits that decade included &quot;The Borrowers&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Chinese Prime Minister&quot; (1974)

==Later career==
In 1982, she returned to &quot;Medea&quot;, this time playing the Nurse opposite Zoe Caldwell in the title role. Caldwell had appeared in a small role in the Australian tour of &quot;Medea&quot; in 1955–56. She was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play.

In 1984, she appeared in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; as the Vulcan High Priestess T&#x27;Lar.

That same year, she commenced a three-year stint as matriarch Minx Lockridge on the NBC serial &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;. When asked why, she replied &quot;Why not? It&#x27;s practically the same as doing a play.&quot;

She had professed to be a fan of the daytime genre – she had watched &quot;General Hospital&quot; for 20 years – but after signing with &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, she complained about her lack of screen time. The highlight of her stint was when Minx tearfully revealed the horrific truth that she had switched the late Channing Capwell with Brick Wallace as a baby, preventing her illegitimate grandson from being raised as a Capwell. This resulted in her receiving a Supporting Actress Emmy nomination although her screen time afterwards diminished to infrequent appearances. After leaving the series, she was succeeded in the role by the quarter-century younger American actress Janis Paige.

In later years, she starred as Minx Lockridge in the daytime NBC soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; from 1984 until 1987.
Her last movies were &quot;The Booth&quot; and &quot;Impure Thoughts&quot; (both 1985).

==Personal life==
Anderson was married twice and declared that &quot;neither experience was a jolly holiday&quot;:
* Benjamin Harrison Lehmann (1889–1977), an English professor at the University of California at Berkeley; they wed in 1937 and divorced in August 1939. By this marriage, she had a stepson, Benjamin Harrison Lehmann Jr. (born 1918).
* Luther Greene (1909–1987), a theatrical producer, and she were married in July 1946 and divorced in 1951.

==Death==
Anderson spent much of her life in Santa Barbara, California, where she died of pneumonia in 1992, aged 94.

==Honours==
Anderson was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1960 and thereafter was often billed as &quot;Dame Judith Anderson&quot;.

On 10 June 1991, in the 1991 Australian Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, she was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), &quot;in recognition of service to the performing arts&quot;.

<text>There is a 3D online virtual world created by Will Harvey and Jeffrey Ventrella. There Inc. was founded in the spring of 1998. Closed beta began in July 2001, with various stages of beta following, and ending with an October 2003 launch date. On March 9, 2010 - one week after the announcement of its closure on March 2, 2010 - There.com shut its doors to the public.

On May 18, 2011, Michael Wilson announced that There.com will be re-opening, on the There.com homepage. All previous members will have access to their old avatars.

On May 2, 2012, There reopened to the public for a monthly subscription fee.

==Corporate history==
From 1998 - 2003, Tom Melcher served as chief executive of There Inc. and There.com Melcher was previously an Executive Vice President for CNET. Mr. Melcher once described There.com&#x27;s archetypal user as &quot;the woman who is in her 30s, single, really overweight, lives in a small town.&quot; In 2003, Melcher stepped down as CEO.

In June 2004, There Inc. went through a restructuring and announced major layoffs. In April 2005, There Inc. announced that the commercial side of the company would be branching out to form two companies: Forterra Systems (the government-contracted client) and Makena Technologies (the commercial client).

In 2006, Makena Technologies announced a partnership with MTV Networks to provide the technology platform for their virtual worlds which include Virtual Laguna Beach, The Virtual Hills, Virtual Pimp My Ride, Virtual Real World, Virtual Newport Harbor, Virtual VMAs (Video Music Awards), Virtual Kaya, Virtual Rob and Big and Virtual Life of Ryan. Makena Technologies also has a partnership with Trilogy Studios.

Corporate brands that had a presence in There.com included Coca-Cola, CosmoGIRL!, Humane Society of the U.S., Capitol Music Group, Paramount Studios, bebe, NaCo USA, K-SWISS, Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, Nike, Levi&#x27;s, and Scion.

In 2008, Makena Technologies launched ThereConnect, allowing There.com members to showcase their in-world profiles, skills, groups and upcoming events on their Facebook pages. They also announced ThereIM, a lightweight instant messaging client where users can communicate with other members’ avatars, whether or not they are signed into the virtual world.

On March 9, 2010 at 11:59 PM Pacific Standard Time, There.com shut down its virtual world for the final time. The CEO of There, inc., has stated very clearly (both privately and publicly) that Makena has no plans of re-opening There.com. There.com offered refunds for all &quot;Therebucks&quot; purchased between February 1, 2010 and March 9, 2010. As of April 1, refunds are no longer available.

On May 18, 2011, Michael Wilson announced that There.com will be re-opening. On May 2, 2012, There re-opened to the public.

==Details==
There is a venue for socializing with less role-playing than is typically found in MMORPGs. Billed on its homepage as &quot;...an online getaway where you can hang out with your friends and meet new ones...&quot;, There defines itself as a service providing a shared experience that allows people to interact in an online society. As of There&#x27;s reopening in May, 2012, the virtual world is only open to ages 18 and older.

Each new member can enter the community by choosing a unique name and a male or female avatar. The avatar&#x27;s name and gender are permanently set, but various attributes such as hair color and style, head and body shapes, skin and eye color, clothing, etc. can be changed as desired. Through their avatars, members can communicate in real-time using emotions, body language, text chat and voice to express themselves.

In addition to customizing their avatars, members can create their own items, such as clothing, vehicles, buildings and furniture, and sell them to others for use in the world. Each object created undergoes a community based submission procedure to ensure its accuracy as well as compliance with international copyright laws. Detailed instructions are available at the developer site provided by Makena, and in world classes are offered for the novice as well as experienced graphic artist. All classes are without charge and open to all.
Most items such as furniture are designed to be used within houses or zones, although some items such as vehicles and dogs are not, due to their mobile nature. Monetary transactions in There&#x27;s economy are done using Therebucks (T$), virtual currency. Therebucks can be purchased directly from There at 1,800 Tbux to US$1.

Members of There.com can participate in activities such as racing vehicles, playing cards, flying, designing homes, playing paintball, hoverboarding and training virtual pets. There is also access to special interest groups devoted to topics including recreation, business, the environment, education and the arts.

In September 2007, all members of There Philippines were moved to the original version. They were required to change usernames (if necessary), and could not bring anything with them but during the change.

===Life in There===
Each new member can enter the community by choosing a unique name and a male or female avatar. The avatar&#x27;s name and gender are permanently set, but various attributes such as hair color and style, head and body shapes, skin and eye color, clothing, etc. can be changed as desired.

Arranging content within houses or zones to create living quarters, meeting places, game rooms, movie sets, race tracks, mazes, yard sales—in short, whatever the member can imagine using available materials. In addition to houses, &quot;fun zones&quot;, and &quot;frontier zones&quot; which maintain a fixed presence and location in the world, There also features &quot;porta-zones&quot;, portable zones that can be relocated or removed from the world when not in use. Porta-zones (or &quot;PAZs&quot;) do not incur rental fees when not in the world. Houses and zones are rented from There on a monthly basis. Neighborhoods and neighborhood lots are the most recent additions to There&#x27;s suite of porta-zones. Members are able to design custom content using There-provided tools and templates, Gmax, and a graphics editor such as Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro or The Gimp. These can then be bought, sold, and traded in the There world. Most items such as furniture were designed to be used within houses or zones, although some items such as vehicles and dogs are not due to their mobile nature. Monetary transactions in There&#x27;s economy are done using a form of virtual currency called Therebucks. Therebucks can be purchased directly from There.

===Size===
As of March 2009, &quot;There&quot; contained 14 major islands, dozens of smaller islands, over 1 million members, and many community places including businesses.

<doc id="463439" wikidata="Q557286" url="?curid=463439" title="Gorch Fock (1933)">
<text>Gorch Fock I (ex Tovarishch, ex Gorch Fock) is a German three-mast barque, the first of a series built as school ships for the German Reichsmarine in 1933.

After World War II she was taken as war reparations by the Soviet Union and renamed &quot;Tovarishch&quot;.
In the 1990s she spent a short period under the Ukrainian flag and a prolonged stay in British ports due to lack of funds for necessary repairs.

After being acquired by sponsors, she sailed to her original home port of Stralsund where her original name of &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; was restored on 29 November 2003. She now serves as a museum ship, and extensive repairs were carried out in 2008.

In 1958 the Federal German government built a replacement training ship which is still in service, also named .

==History and details==
The German school ship &quot;Niobe&quot;, a three-masted barque, capsized on 26 July 1932 in the Baltic Sea near Fehmarn due to a sudden squall, killing 69. The loss prompted the German Navy to order a new training vessel built. Flags were lowered to half-mast from Flensburg to Konstanz as a public outpouring of grief gripped the nation. The Prussian State Mint issued a &quot;Niobe&quot; memorial coin to help raise money for a replacement ship, and soon earned 200,000 Reichsmarks towards the effort.

A request for proposal went out to all the major shipyards, including Deutsche Werke, Howaldtswerke, and Germaniawerft for the &quot;Project 1115 Replacement Niobe&quot;. Joh. C. Tecklenborg, who had built one of Germany&#x27;s previous training ships, &quot;Grossherzog Friedrich August&quot;, had just gone out of business and was unable to compete. Dr Wilhelm Süchting&#x27;s design for Blohm+Voss, who had also built the German training ship, &quot;Prinzess Eitel Friedrich&quot;, won the bid, and construction began at their yard in Hamburg on 2 December 1932. She was completed in a record 100 days. 

On 3 May 1933 the ship was launched and named &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; in honor of German writer Johann Kinau, who wrote under the pseudonym &quot;Gorch Fock&quot;. Kinau had died in the 1916 Battle of Jutland aboard the cruiser . 10,000 spectators attended &quot;Gorch Fock&#x27;s&quot; launching, including Johann Kinau&#x27;s mother. The launching was presided by Admiral Erich Raeder, and christened by Marie Fröhlich of the &quot;German Woman&#x27;s Fleet Association&quot;, with the &quot;Karlsruhe&quot; on station as a guard of honor.

Commissioned by the German Navy on 26 June 1933, &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; is a three-masted barque. She has square sails on the fore and main masts, and is gaff rigged on the mizzen. The steel hull has a sparred length of , a width of and a draught of . She has a displacement at full load of 1510 tons. Her main mast stands high above deck and she carries 23 sails totalling . She is equipped with an auxiliary engine of .

The training ship was designed to be robust and safe against capsizing. More than 300 tons of steel ballast in the keel give her a righting moment large enough to bring her back in the upright position even when she heels over to nearly a 90°.

&quot;Gorch Fock&quot; served as a training vessel for the German Reichsmarine prior to World War II. During the war, she was a stationary office ship in Stralsund, until she was officially reactivated on 19 April 1944. On 1 May 1945, the crew scuttled her in shallow waters off Rügen in an attempt to avoid her capture by the Soviets, who already had fired at her for 45 minutes with tanks.

The Soviets ordered Stralsund-based company &quot;B. Staude Schiffsbergung&quot; to raise and salvage her, which after some difficulties was done in 1947 at a cost of 800,000 Reichsmark (equivalent to million euros). She was under restoration between 1948 and 1950. She was then named &quot;Tovarishch&quot; (Russian for &quot;Comrade&quot;) in 1951 and put into service as a training vessel. Her new home port was Odessa. She participated in many Tall Ships&#x27; Races and cruised far and wide on the seven seas. She made a voyage around the world in 1957 and won the Operation Sail race twice, in 1974 and 1976.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, &quot;Tovarishch&quot; sailed under the Ukrainian flag (home port Kherson) until 1993, when she needed repairs and was deactivated for lack of funds. In 1994, she sailed from Kherson to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where private sponsors wanted to have her repaired. This stalled because of the high costs, and, declared unseaworthy, she was left moored at Middlesbrough&#x27;s Middlehaven for five years. During this time, she was continually crewed by cadets from the Kherson State Maritime Academy (the crews were changed twice yearly), and provided with electricity and provisions. In August 1999, with funding secured for her restoration, the ship was transported to Wilhelmshaven, where she stayed in dock for four years until finally transferred to Stralsund in 2003. On 29 November 2003 the ship was re-christened &quot;Gorch Fock&quot;.

As of 2011 the ship is in poor but stable condition. There is about six million dollars worth of restoration work required to bring this ship back to sailing condition. The museum had a dismal tourist season, resulting in a fifty thousand dollar loss in revenue from previous years. This has forced a layoff of five workers. The ship was renovated at a shipyard in Stralsund in 2024.

==Sister ships==

The design of &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; proved highly successful. She was the first of a series of five sister ships built by Blohm &amp; Voss, and a number of South American school ships are also based on the same design. Of the three original sister ships, only is an exact replica of &quot;Gorch Fock&quot;. &quot;Horst Wessel&quot; and are longer, and all three have slightly more powerful auxiliary engines.

===USCGC &quot;Eagle&quot; (ex &quot;Horst Wessel&quot;)===

&quot;Horst Wessel&quot; was launched in 1936—the growing Reichsmarine needed more school ships. Her home port was Kiel. At the end of World War II, she became one of several war reparations and was assigned to the United States. After some repairs in Wilhelmshaven and Bremerhaven, she was sailed by her German crew including the Captain together with American sailors to her new home port of New London, Connecticut. Since then, she has sailed under the name for the United States Coast Guard.
===&quot;Sagres&quot; (ex &quot;Albert Leo Schlageter&quot;)===
&quot;Albert Leo Schlageter&quot; was launched on 30 October 1937. She was confiscated by the United States after World War II and then sold to Brazil, where she sailed as a school ship under the name &quot;Guanabara&quot;. In 1961, the Portuguese Navy bought her to replace the previous school ship &quot;Sagres&quot; (which was later transferred to Hamburg, where she is a museum ship under her original name &quot;Rickmer Rickmers&quot;). The Portuguese named her also. She still sails as of 2015, having completed a circumnavigation on 24 December 2010.
===&quot;Mircea&quot;===
 was built by Blohm &amp; Voss for the Romanian Navy. She was launched in 1938 and has always sailed under the Romanian flag (except for a short period after World War II, when she was confiscated by the Soviet Union). She is the only one of the sister ships that is truly identical to &quot;Gorch Fock&quot;. She was overhauled at the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyards in Hamburg in 1966, and she still sails .
===&quot;Herbert Norkus&quot;===
Named after the Hitler Youth martyr Herbert Norkus, another ship of the &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; design—with the same dimensions as &quot;Horst Wessel&quot;—was begun at the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard. However, the unfinished ship had to be launched prematurely on 7 November 1939 because the slipway had to be cleared to build submarines. The hull stayed in the harbor of Hamburg throughout World War II. It was damaged in a bomb raid in 1945, and instead of being sold to Brazil as had been considered, ended up being filled with gas grenades and sunk in the Skagerrak in 1947.

The yards, which had been prepared, but not yet mounted, and the tackle, which had not yet been rigged, were later used for &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; built in 1958.

===&quot;Gorch Fock&quot;===

As Germany had lost all of its training vessels as war reparations after World War II, the West German Bundesmarine decided in 1957 to have a new training ship built following the plans for &quot;Gorch Fock&quot;. The new ship was a modernized rebuild of &quot;Horst Wessel&quot;. Coincidentally, her design had been influenced by another shipwreck: whereas the 1933 &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; was built in response to the &quot;Niobe&quot; disaster, the plans of &quot;SSS Gorch Fock&quot; were altered somewhat after the sinking of in 1957.

The modern-day was launched on 23 August 1958 and commissioned on 17 December of that year.
===Latin American ships===
A number of similar ships have been built by the Astilleros Celaya S.A. shipyard in Bilbao for Latin American Navies, possibly following the Blohm &amp; Voss design. The hulls and rigging of these ships are very similar, the main differences are in the superstructure and they also have larger tanks for both diesel and water, and they are also longer. These ships are (1967, Colombia), (1976, Ecuador), (1979, Venezuela), and (1982, Mexico).

<doc id="463443" wikidata="Q3267048" url="?curid=463443" title="Rice burner">
<text>Rice burner is a pejorative term originally applied to Japanese motorcycles and which later expanded to include Japanese cars or any East Asian-made vehicles. Variations include rice rocket, referring most often to Japanese superbikes, rice machine, rice grinder or simply ricer.

Riced out is an adjective denigrating a badly customized sports car, &quot;usually with oversized or ill-matched exterior appointments&quot;. Rice boy is a US derogatory term for the driver or builder of an import-car hot rod. The terms may disparage cars or car enthusiasts as imposters or wanna-bes, using cheap modifications to imitate the appearance of high performance.

The term is often defined as offensive or racist stereotyping. In some cases, users of the term assert that it is not offensive or racist, or else treat the term as a humorous, mild insult rather than a racial slur.

==Early usage 1917 to 1930s==
Examples of &quot;rice burner&quot; used literally, meaning one who burns rice or rice fields, as in stubble burning, date to 1917. In 1935 it appeared in a US newspaper caption with a racial connotation, disparaging East Asian people.

==Korean War early 1950s==
Canadian troops in the Korean War initially referred to the Korean labor and support unit providing their food, water, ammunition and other supplies as &quot;G Company&quot; which was code for the racist slur gook. They quickly became known instead as &quot;rice burners,&quot; due to the Canadians&#x27; admiration for their Korean support unit&#x27;s demonstrated strength and stamina in carrying loads over rough terrain, sometimes in snow and ice. While dehumanizing the Koreans as machines that ran on rice was a form of contempt, it was condescendingly approved by the men serving at the time as an improvement over the word it replaced. Comparably, Alaskan slang for a sled dog is &quot;fish burner,&quot; as in a beast of burden that runs on fish.

==UK 1960s==
&quot;Rice-burner&quot; appeared in the British motorcycling magazine &quot;The Motor Cycle&quot; in 1966 as a generally disparaging term for Japanese motorcycles.

==US 1970s==
By the 1970s, rice burner was a US English slang term for the Vietnamese people during and after the Vietnam War. It was used in the US by &quot;Detroit loyalists&quot; to disparage more economical Japanese competitors of the US car industry during the 1970s energy crisis. It continued to appear in US publications through the 2002 to as a put-down for Japanese and other Asian cars.

==UK 1980s==
&quot;The Rice Burner&quot; was a turbocharged Kawasaki Z1000-engined drag-bike, built and raced by North Coventry Kawasaki, a retail motorcycle business in Coventry, England, specializing in turbocharged conversion kits for street and competition machines procured from Jack O&#x27;Malley, of Orient Express, New York.

==Poser stereotype==
T-Mobile&#x27;s 2005 &quot;Poser Mobile&quot; parody advertisements created a stereotypical caricature &quot;rice burner&quot; or &quot;boy racer&quot; car as perceived by critics of the import scene, along with such cars&#x27; drivers, whose appearance and behavior is comically aspirational and &quot;phony&quot;, contrasted with people whose clothing, speech, and cars are more &quot;authentic&quot;. The video, online and point-of-purchase display ad campaign, created by the Publicis agency&#x27;s Seattle office, was about the &quot;Poser Mobile Posse&quot;, including &quot;Big Spenda Lopez&quot;, &quot;The Fee Jones&quot;, &quot;25 cent Chang&quot; who are weak imitations of both real hip hop performers and a &quot;real&quot; mobile phone provider.

<doc id="463446" wikidata="Q6696066" url="?curid=463446" title="LucasVarity">
<text>LucasVarity plc was a UK automotive parts manufacturer, created by a merger of the British Lucas Industries plc, and the North American Varity Corporation in August 1996.

==History==

LucasVarity traces its history back to the 1850s when Joseph Lucas, a jobless father of six, sold paraffin oil from a barrow cart around the streets of Hockley. In 1860, he founded the firm and his 17-year-old son Harry joined the firm around 1872. At first it made general pressed metal merchandise, including plant pot holders, scoops and buckets, and later in 1875 lamps for ships. Together with the historic Canadian farm equipment maker Massey Ferguson the company was formed in August 1996, by the merger between what was then called Lucas Industries plc and the North American Varity Corporation, successor to Massey Ferguson. 
===Foundation===
At the time of the merger, Lucas employed 46,000 people compared with Varity&#x27;s 9,000. LucasVarity announced plans for a £65 million pound savings programme. The areas streamlined included the treasury, communications and marketing departments, as well as divisional managers. &quot;The merger created a unique opportunity to reassess the skills and competencies we require in the senior management team&quot;, said LucasVarity Chief Executive Victor A. Rice.

===Attempted relocation to the United States===
In 1998, the management attempted to shift the company&#x27;s head office and primary listing to the United States. The company suffered an embarrassing defeat in a shareholder vote, amid claims that its directors were looking to cash in on the much higher pay packets available in the United States. Victor Rice suffered a barrage of criticism from shareholders and the British media.

===Sale to TRW===
Following this defeat, an offer was made by TRW, an American company specializing in satellites, defence and automotive parts, to purchase the company in an all-cash offer, which was accepted in March 1999.

===Subsequent history===
TRW quickly sold Lucas Diesel Systems to Delphi, which was then a USA based automotive parts and systems manufacturer with a large presence in Europe, during January 2000. The diesel fuel injection equipment research, engineering and manufacturing business of Lucas, known in later years as Lucas Diesel Systems Ltd (and previously CAV Ltd) continues at all of its original worldwide sites (with the exception of those in Japan and South Carolina, USA which had closed by this time). The business name has been changed to Delphi and the business is a major part of its Powertrain Division.

Lucas Aerospace (by then called TRW Aeronautical Systems) was sold to Goodrich Corporation, which itself is now part of UTC Aerospace Systems.

TRW itself was later acquired by Northrop Grumman, who sold the automotive assets of Lucas, Varity and TRW&#x27;s own automotive group to the Blackstone Group as TRW Automotive.

In September 2004 Elta Lighting Ltd., a UK-based automotive electrical components supplier, acquired a license from TRW Automotive to use the Lucas name and logo on products in the UK and Europe. This saw the familiar green and white &#x27;Lucas&#x27; logo return to the UK after several years absence. Now trading under the name of &#x27;Lucas Electrical&#x27; the company concentrates on after-market component supply rather than as an original equipment supplier to manufacturers. Initially the Lucas name was used on Elta&#x27;s existing product of automotive light bulbs but has been gradually expanded to cover much the same range as the original Lucas company- light units, batteries, switches and controls, ignition components, remanufactured starter motors and alternators, wiper blades and electrical accessories. Operations and manufacturing take place at several locations in the UK as well as overseas.

==Operations==
At formation LucasVarity was managed in seven divisions. The current ownership of these divisions is detailed below.

<text>James Davies Lightbody (March 16, 1882 – March 2, 1953) was an American middle distance runner, winner of six Olympic medals (two of which are no longer recognized by the International Olympic Committee following its downgrading of the 1906 Intercalated Games) in the early 20th century.

Lightbody, born in Pittsburgh and graduating from Central High School in Muncie, Indiana, had great success at the 1904 Summer Olympics, held in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. He was not favoured in any of the three individual events in which he competed, but nevertheless won all three of them.

First, he won the 2590 metre steeplechase, sprinting to the 800 metres title days later. Finally, he won the 1500 metres in a new world record. Later that day, he added a second place to his tally, when he competed with the Chicago Athletic Association in the 4-mile team event.

In 1905, Lightbody won AAU titles in both the 800 and 1500 metres, and the following year he competed in his second Olympics, the 1906 Intercalated Games of in Athens. He successfully defended his 1500 metres title, and placed second in the 800 metres.

Lightbody competed again in the 1908 Summer Olympics. In the 800 metres, he placed only fourth in his first round heat. Lightbody lost a close race to fellow American James Sullivan in the first round of the 1500 metres, eliminating him from further competition. He was defeated by a mere ten yards by Harry Sewell in the first round of the 3200 metre steeplechase and did not qualify for the final.

Lightbody died in 1953, two weeks short of his 71st birthday in Charleston, South Carolina.

<text>Urban-type settlement is an official designation for lesser urbanized settlements, used in several Central and Eastern European countries. The term was primarily used in the Soviet Union and later also for a short time in socialist Bulgaria and socialist Poland. It remains in use today in nine of the post-Soviet states.

The designation was used in all 15 member republics of the Soviet Union from 1922. It was introduced later in Poland (1954) and Bulgaria (1964). All the urban-type settlements in Poland were transformed into other types of settlement (town or village) in 1972. In Bulgaria and five of the post-Soviet republics (Armenia, Moldova, and the three Baltic states), they were changed in the early 1990s, while Ukraine followed suit in 2023. Today, this term is still used in the other nine post-Soviet republics – Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan. It is also used in Transnistria, an unrecognised breakaway state in Moldova.

What counts as an urban-type settlement differs between time periods and countries and often between different divisions of a single country. However, the criteria generally focus on the presence of urban infrastructure or resort facilities for urban residents.

==Soviet Union==
In the Soviet Union, the criteria of urban-type settlements were set independently by the Soviet republics. Those criteria, however, only differed very slightly from one republic to another.

===Russian SFSR===
In the Russian SFSR, urban-type settlements were subdivided into three types:
*Work settlements (): localities with factories, mining industry, power stations, construction industry, with population of at least 3,000 and with at least 85% of the population being workers, professionals, and the members of their families;
*Resort settlements (): localities focusing on resort and health facilities (around beaches, mineral water spas, etc.), with population of at least 2,000, with at least 50% of the average annual population being non-permanent residents;
*Suburban settlements (dacha settlements, ): settlements with a focus on private summer-time and weekend recreation, with no more than 25% of the permanent population being employed in the agricultural sector.

===Ukrainian SSR===
In 1981, the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR defined an urban-type settlement as follows:
&quot;To the category of an urban-type settlement may be included any settlement located near industrial enterprises, buildings, railroad connections, hydro-technical constructions, and enterprises in production and refining of agrarian products as well as settlements that include higher or middle occupation educational establishments, science-researching institutions, sanatoria, and other stationary treatment and recreation establishments that have a state housing provided to no less than 2,000 inhabitants. 

The term was introduced in Ukraine in 1920s and became official since the resolution of the Central Executive Committee of Ukraine of October 28, 1925 replacing all towns (mistechko) as urban-type settlement.

==Modern usage==
=== Azerbaijan ===
As of 2011, there were 256 urban-type settlements in Azerbaijan.

===Belarus===

According to a 1998 law of Belarus, there are three categories of urban-type settlement in the country:
*Urban settlements: with population over 2,000, industrial enterprises and developed residential infrastructure.
*Resort settlements: with population of at least 2,000, sanatoriums, resorts or other health recuperation establishments, and developed residential infrastructure.
*Worker settlements: with population at least 500, servicing industrial enterprises, construction sites, railroad stations, electric stations, or other industrial objects.

=== Georgia ===
As of 2014, there were 47 urban-type settlements in Georgia. Eight of them are located on the territory of the partially recognized states of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and are de facto not under the control of the Georgian government.

=== Kazakhstan ===
As of 2019, there were 48 urban-type settlements in Kazakhstan.

=== Kyrgyzstan ===
In accordance with the 2008 Law on Administrative and Territorial Subdivision of Kyrgyzstan, urban-type settlements are those that comprise economically significant facilities such as industrial plants, railway stations, construction sites, etc., as well as settlements with a recreational potential with population of at least 2,000. In exceptional cases, administrative, economic and cultural centers with a potential of economical development and population growth can be classified as urban-type settlements.

===Russia===

====Inhabited localities====
In modern Russia, the task of deciding whether an inhabited locality meets the criteria of urban-type settlements is delegated to the federal subjects. In most cases, the federal subject&#x27;s legislative body is responsible for all administrative and territorial changes, including granting and revoking of the urban-type settlement and town status.

====Administrative divisions====
Apart from being used to refer to a type of inhabited locality, the term &quot;urban-type settlement&quot; and its variations is also used to refer to a division of an administrative district, and sometimes to a division administratively subordinated to a city district of a city of federal subject significance. This kind of administrative division is equal in status to the towns of district significance and selsoviets, and is normally centered on an inhabited locality with urban-type settlement status. As of 2013, the following types of such entities are recognized:
*Resort settlement (): in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast
*Settlement (): in the Republic of Dagestan and the Sakha Republic; in Krasnoyarsk and Stavropol Krais
*Settlement administration (): in Altai Krai
*Settlement administrative okrug (): in Bryansk Oblast
*Settlement council (): in the Republic of Bashkortostan and the Udmurt Republic; in Altai Krai; in Tambov Oblast
*Settlement municipal formation (): in Leningrad Oblast
*Settlement okrug (): in Krasnodar Krai; in Belgorod and Ulyanovsk Oblasts
*Suburban settlement (): in Moscow and Omsk Oblasts
*Urban settlement (): in the Chuvash Republic; in Amur, Rostov, Smolensk, Tver, and Voronezh Oblasts
*Urban settlement (urban-type settlement) (): in Kostroma Oblast
*Urban-type settlement (): in the Republic of Buryatia, the Chechen Republic, the Mari El Republic, and the Republic of Tatarstan; in Astrakhan, Kemerovo, Kirov, Murmansk, Nizhny Novgorod, Oryol, Sakhalin, Tula, Volgograd, and Vologda Oblasts
*Urban-type settlement administrative territory (): in the Komi Republic
*Urban-type settlement of district significance (): in Kaliningrad Oblast and Nenets Autonomous Okrug
*Urban-type settlement (settlement council) (): in the Republic of Khakassia
*Urban-type settlement under district jurisdiction (): in Kurgan Oblast
*Urban-type settlement (urban settlement) (): in the Tuva Republic
*Urban-type settlement with jurisdictional territory (): in Arkhangelsk Oblast
*Work settlement (): in the Republic of Mordovia; in Krasnoyarsk Krai; in Belgorod, Chelyabinsk, Kursk, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk, Omsk, Penza, Ryazan, and Yaroslavl Oblasts

=== Tajikistan ===
As of January 1, 2018, there were 57 urban-type settlements in Tajikistan.

=== Turkmenistan ===
As of February 1, 2016, there were 76 urban-type settlements in Turkmenistan.

===Uzbekistan===
As of January 1, 2011, 1,065 settlements have urban-type settlement status in Uzbekistan.

== Former usage ==

=== Armenia ===
Urban-type settlements existed in Armenia until the 1990s. Currently, all of them have been converted into cities or villages.

=== Baltic states ===
In Estonia, the urban-type settlements were created in 1945 during the Estonian SSR. In the 1990s most of them were transformed into cities.

The urban-type settlements existed in Latvia from 1949 to 1993, when they were converted into cities and rural settlements.

Lithuania formerly used the urban-type settlement (Lithuanian: &quot;miesto tipo gyvenvietė&quot;, &quot;m.t.g.&quot;) system until 1995.

=== Bulgaria ===
In Bulgaria, the first urban-type settlements (Bulgarian: селище от градски тип) were formed in 1964. In the 1990s they were transformed into villages and cities.

=== Moldova ===
The urban-type settlement system was used on the territory of Moldova since 1924. In the 1990s they were converted either into cities or rural settlements. The disputed and unrecognized Transnistria continues to use this system.

=== Poland ===
The urban-type settlements (Polish: &quot;osiedle typu miejskiego&quot;) were used in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic from 1954 to 1972. Nowadays, Poland has cities, villages and settlements.

===Ukraine===
Ukraine formerly used the urban-type settlement (Ukrainian: селище міського типу, с.м.т.) system until 2023. On 24 October 2023 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed Law No. 8263 that abolished the concepts of &quot;urban-type settlement&quot; and &quot;rural-type settlement&quot; in Ukraine. The law came into an effect on January 26, 2024. Since then, settlements that belonged to the category of &quot;urban-type settlements&quot; have been classified as &quot;settlements&quot; (Ukrainian: селище). The law was meant to facilitate &quot;de-Sovietization of the procedure for solving certain issues of the administrative and territorial system of Ukraine&quot;.

In 1991 there were 921 urban-type settlements in Ukraine.

<text>Al-Iskandariya or Alexandria (, also given as Iskandariyah, Iskanderiyah, Iskanderiya, Iskanderiyeh or Sikandariyeh or Al Askandariyah) is an ancient city in central Iraq, one of a number of towns in the Near East founded by and named after Alexander the Great (&quot;Al-Iskandar&quot; in Arabic). It is a majority Shia Arab district including Musayyib and Jurf Al Sakhr. The district capital is located about 70 kilometres (45 mi) south of Baghdad, near the Euphrates River.

==History==
In ancient times Alexandria stood halfway between Babylon (the place of Alexander&#x27;s death) and Seleucia on the Tigris (the capital of the Seleucid Empire, very near to modern Baghdad).

Buildings are mostly constructed with brick, mud, and sheet metal. The nearby city of Musayyib houses the largest power plant in Iraq. The Hateen Munitions Complex located in and around Alexandria housed the majority of the munitions for the former regime. There are also apartments in Iskandariya, called the Hateen Apartments, which received their name from all the workers at the munitions plant living there.

===Saddam Hussein&#x27;s nuclear programme===

During the late 1980s, Alexandria was the site of a major element of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s programme to acquire nuclear weapons. The Al Qaqaa State Establishment, located in the town, is believed to have been put in charge of developing the non-nuclear components for a nuclear weapon. It was subsequently inspected by United Nations weapons inspectors and officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In 1989, the British journalist Farzad Bazoft was arrested there after visiting Alexandria to check reports that an explosion at the Al Qaqaa plant had killed 7000 people. He was subsequently executed by the Iraqi authorities.

The town is also the location of a major factory, the al-Quds General Company for Mechanical Industries. In 2001, the Iraqi government explored the possibility of establishing a joint Iraqi-Belarusian tractor factory on the site.

===During the 2003 invasion of Iraq===

Alexandria is one of the last big towns before Baghdad and possesses a major military air base, and as such was a major target for United States forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It fell quickly but was subsequently the scene of a number of lethal insurgent attacks against U.S. forces and the post-Saddam Iraqi security forces. On June 19, 2003, a soldier from the 804th Medical Brigade was killed when the military ambulance in which he was traveling was hit by a rocket propelled grenade near Alexandria. Another attack, on May 11, 2007, killed a soldier from the 18th Military Police Brigade. Three US Paratroopers from the Army&#x27;s 82nd Airborne Division were killed by a roadside bomb on January 27, 2004 and another bombing on February 4 killed yet another soldier.

Forward Operating Base Alexandria, or FOB Iskandariyah a U.S. Military installation was established in Alexandria in May 2003.

On February 10, a car bomb outside a police station killed at least 45 Iraqis and wounded 150. No coalition forces were killed or injured, but commentators suggested that the attack was both a strike against pro-coalition Iraqi forces and an attempt to create conflict between Shia and Sunni Muslims.

On March 25, 2016 a terrorist believed to be affiliated with Islamic State of Iraq blew himself up at a soccer game in this town. The incident happened during an award ceremony following the game. The blast reportedly killed at least 31 people and injured more than 70 others. The town&#x27;s mayor was among the casualties. Video surfaced on the Internet which claimed to show the bombing.

This town is the location of Al Qa&#x27;qaa, a major industrial facility and the location of the Al Qa&#x27;qaa high explosives controversy.

<doc id="463461" wikidata="Q146021" url="?curid=463461" title="Pinus peuce">
<text>Pinus peuce (Macedonian pine or Balkan pine) (Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian: молика, molika; Bulgarian: бяла мура, byala mura) is a species of pine native to the mountains of North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Albania, Montenegro, Kosovo, the extreme southwest of Serbia, and the extreme north of Greece, growing typically at (600-) 1,000-2,200 (-2,300) m altitude. It often reaches the alpine tree line in this area. The mature size is up to 35–40 m height, and 1.5 m trunk diameter. However, the height of the tree diminishes strongly near the upper tree line and may even obtain shrub sizes.

It is a member of the white pine group, &quot;Pinus&quot; subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;, and like all members of that group, the leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. They are 6–11 cm long. Its pine cones are mostly 8–16 cm long, occasionally up to 20 cm long, green at first, becoming yellow-brown when mature, with broad, flat to downcurved scales. The 6–7 mm long seeds have a 2 cm wing and can be wind-dispersed, but are also very often dispersed by spotted nutcrackers.

The species was first described in scientific literature by August Grisebach in 1844, based on field observations of montane pines on Baba Mountain, above Bitola.

==Use==
Macedonian pine is one of the most valuable conifer species in the Balkan Peninsula. Its durable wood is highly valued in construction, furniture production, wood-carving and cooperage. The tree is also exceptionally good at adapting to severe mountain climate conditions, which makes it a valuable species for afforestation on high terrain for protection against erosion. The local population use &quot;P. peuce&quot; resin to cure wounds, pectoral, skin and stomach diseases, varicose veins and other illnesses.

Macedonian pine is also a popular ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, giving reliable steady though not fast growth on a wide range of sites. It is very tolerant of severe winter cold, hardy down to at least -45 °C, and also of wind exposure. It is locally naturalised in Punkaharju in eastern Finland.

Like other European and Asian white pines, Macedonian pine is very resistant to white pine blister rust (&quot;Cronartium ribicola&quot;). This fungal disease was accidentally introduced from Europe into North America, where it has caused severe mortality in the American native white pines (e.g. western white pine, sugar pine, whitebark pine) in many areas. Macedonian pine is of great value for research into hybridisation and genetic modification to develop rust resistance in these species; hybrids with eastern white pine inherit some resistance.

==Other==
Synonyms include &quot;Pinus cembra&quot; var. &quot;fruticosa&quot; Griseb., &quot;Pinus excelsa&quot; var. &quot;peuce&quot; (Griseb.) Beissn., &quot;Pinus peuce&quot; var. &quot;vermiculata&quot; Christ, and Balkan pine.

<text>The square-tailed drongo (Dicrurus ludwigii), formerly the common square-tailed drongo, is a passerine bird in the family Dicruridae. It is a common resident breeder in parts of southern Africa.

These insectivorous birds are usually found in forests or dense bush. They are aggressive and fearless birds, given their small size, at , and will attack much larger species if their nest or young are threatened. The male is mainly glossy black, although the wings are duller. The female is similar but less glossy. The bill is black and heavy, and the eye is red. This species is similar to the fork-tailed drongo, but is smaller, and the shorter tail lacks the deep fork which gives the latter species its name. The fork-tailed drongo is also typically found in more open habitat. The common square-tailed drongo has short legs and sits very upright whilst perched prominently, like a shrike. It flycatches or take prey from the ground. The call is a harsh &quot;&quot;. Two to three eggs are laid in a cup nest in a fork high in a tree.

==Taxonomy==
The square-tailed drongo was described by the Scottish zoologist Andrew Smith in 1834 from birds observed around Port Natal (now Durban) in South Africa. He coined the binomial name &quot;Edolius ludwigii&quot;. The specific epithet was chosen to honour the German botanist Baron von Ludwig who collected plants in South Africa between 1805 and 1847. It is now placed with the other drongos in the genus &quot;Dicrurus&quot; that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816. Based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2018, the taxonomy of the square-tailed drongo complex was reorganised. Sharpe&#x27;s drongo which had previously been treated as a subspecies of &quot;Dicrurus ludwigii&quot; was promoted to species rank becoming &quot;Dicrurus sharpei&quot;. But those birds previously in &quot;Dicrurus ludwigii sharpei&quot; occurring between Senegal and the Niger River were considered as a separate species, the western square-tailed drongo (&quot;Dicrurus occidentalis&quot;).

Four subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;D. l. muenzneri&quot; Reichenow, 1915 – south Somalia and east Kenya to Tanzania, north Mozambique
* &quot;D. l. saturnus&quot; Clancey, 1976 – Angola (except northwest), north Zambia, north Mozambique
* &quot;D. l. tephrogaster&quot; Clancey, 1975 – Malawi, south and central Mozambique
* &quot;D. l. ludwigii&quot; (Smith, A, 1834) – South Africa to Limpopo River

<text>Gauche Socialiste () is an officially recognised faction within the political party Québec solidaire and an affiliate of the reunified Fourth International.

== Origins ==

It was formed in 1983 by Trotskyists who left or were expelled from the Revolutionary Workers League/Ligue Ouvrière Révolutionnaire when the group turned away from Trotskyism in the early 1980s. &quot;Gauche Socialiste&quot; members had previously been in the &quot;Organisation Combat Socialiste&quot;, which existed from 1980 to 1982, and were briefly part of the Mouvement socialiste, which was founded in 1981.
Gauche Socialiste is the Quebec section of the reunified Fourth International. The group publishes the periodical &quot;La Gauche&quot;. The group&#x27;s counterpart in English Canada was Socialist Challenge which later joined the New Socialist Group and formed a Fourth International Caucus within it.

In 2002, Gauche Socialiste participated in the creation of the Union des forces progressistes (UFP) and subsequently in 2006 supported the creation of Québec solidaire through the merger of the UFP and Option citoyenne. In 2007, GS was one of two groups to receive party recognition as a collective (faction).

<doc id="463469" wikidata="Q207762" url="?curid=463469" title="Tree line">
<text>The tree line is the edge of a habitat at which trees are capable of growing and beyond which they are not. It is found at high elevations and high latitudes. Beyond the tree line, trees cannot tolerate the environmental conditions (usually low temperatures, extreme snowpack, or associated lack of available moisture). The tree line is sometimes distinguished from a lower timberline, which is the line below which trees form a forest with a closed canopy.

At the tree line, tree growth is often sparse, stunted, and deformed by wind and cold. This is sometimes known as (German for &quot;crooked wood&quot;).

The tree line often appears well-defined, but it can be a more gradual transition. Trees grow shorter and often at lower densities as they approach the tree line, above which they are unable to grow at all. Given a certain latitude, the tree line is approximately 300 to 1000 meters below the permanent snow line and roughly parallel to it.

==Causes==

Due to their vertical structure, trees are more susceptible to cold than more ground-hugging forms of plants. Summer warmth generally sets the limit to which tree growth can occur: while tree line conifers are very frost-hardy during most of the year, they become sensitive to just 1 or 2 degrees of frost in mid-summer. A series of warm summers in the 1940s seems to have permitted the establishment of &quot;significant numbers&quot; of spruce seedlings above the previous treeline in the hills near Fairbanks, Alaska. Survival depends on a sufficiency of new growth to support the tree. Wind can mechanically damage tree tissues directly, including blasting with windborne particles, and may also contribute to the desiccation of foliage, especially of shoots that project above the snow cover.

The actual tree line is set by the mean temperature, while the realized tree line may be affected by disturbances, such as logging, or grazing Most human activities cannot change the actual tree line, unless they affect the climate. The tree line follows the line where the seasonal mean temperature is approximately . The seasonal mean temperature is taken over all days whose mean temperature is above . A growing season of 94 days above that temperature is required for tree growth.

Because of climate change, which leads to earlier snow melt and favorable conditions for tree establishment, the tree line in North Cascades National Park has risen more than in 50 years.

== Types ==

Several types of tree lines are defined in ecology and geography:

===Alpine===

An alpine tree line is the highest elevation that sustains trees; higher up it is too cold, or the snow cover lasts for too much of the year, to sustain trees. The climate above the tree line of mountains is called an alpine climate, and the habitat can be described as the alpine zone. Treelines on north-facing slopes in the northern hemisphere are lower than on south-facing slopes, because the increased shade on north-facing slopes means the snowpack takes longer to melt. This shortens the growing season for trees. In the southern hemisphere, the south-facing slopes have the shorter growing season.

The alpine tree line boundary is seldom abrupt: it usually forms a transition zone between closed forest below and treeless alpine zone above. This zone of transition occurs &quot;near the top of the tallest peaks in the northeastern United States, high up on the giant volcanoes in central Mexico, and on mountains in each of the 11 western states and throughout much of Canada and Alaska&quot;. Environmentally dwarfed shrubs (&quot;krummholz&quot;) commonly form the upper limit.

The decrease in air temperature with increasing elevation creates the alpine climate. The rate of decrease can vary in different mountain chains, from per of elevation gain in the dry mountains of the western United States, to per in the moister mountains of the eastern United States. Skin effects and topography can create microclimates that alter the general cooling trend.

Compared with arctic tree lines, alpine tree lines may receive fewer than half of the number of degree days (above ) based on air temperature, but because solar radiation intensities are greater at alpine than at arctic tree lines the number of degree days calculated from leaf temperatures may be very similar.

At the alpine tree line, tree growth is inhibited when excessive snow lingers and shortens the growing season to the point where new growth would not have time to harden before the onset of fall frost. Moderate snowpack, however, may promote tree growth by insulating the trees from extreme cold during the winter, curtailing water loss, and prolonging a supply of moisture through the early part of the growing season. However, snow accumulation in sheltered gullies in the Selkirk Mountains of southeastern British Columbia causes the tree line to be lower than on exposed intervening shoulders.

In some mountainous areas, higher elevations above the condensation line, or on equator-facing and leeward slopes, can result in low rainfall and increased exposure to solar radiation. This dries out the soil, resulting in a localized arid environment unsuitable for trees. Many south-facing ridges of the mountains of the Western U.S. have a lower treeline than the northern faces because of increased sun exposure and aridity. Hawaii&#x27;s treeline of about is also above the condensation zone and results due to a lack of moisture.

===Exposure===
On coasts and isolated mountains, the tree line is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce tree growth. In addition, the lack of suitable soil, such as along talus slopes or exposed rock formations, prevents trees from gaining an adequate foothold and exposes them to drought and sun.

===Arctic===

The Arctic tree line is the northernmost latitude in the Northern Hemisphere where trees can grow; farther north, it is too cold all year round to sustain trees. Extremely low temperatures, especially when prolonged, can freeze the internal sap of trees, killing them. In addition, permafrost in the soil can prevent trees from getting their roots deep enough for the necessary structural support.

Unlike alpine tree lines, the northern tree line occurs at low elevations. The Arctic forest–tundra transition zone in northwestern Canada varies in width, perhaps averaging and widening markedly from west to east, in contrast with the telescoped alpine timberlines. North of the arctic tree line lies the low-growing tundra, and southwards lies the boreal forest.

Two zones can be distinguished in the Arctic tree line: a forest–tundra zone of scattered patches of &quot;krummholz&quot; or stunted trees, with larger trees along rivers and on sheltered sites set in a matrix of tundra; and &quot;open boreal forest&quot; or &quot;lichen woodland&quot;, consisting of open groves of erect trees underlain by a carpet of &quot;Cladonia&quot; spp. lichens. The proportion of trees to lichen mat increases southwards towards the &quot;forest line&quot;, where trees cover 50 percent or more of the landscape.

===Antarctic===
A southern treeline exists in the New Zealand Subantarctic Islands and the Australian Macquarie Island, with places where mean annual temperatures above support trees and woody plants, and those below do not.
Another treeline exists in the southwesternmost parts of the Magellanic subpolar forests ecoregion, where the forest merges into the subantarctic tundra (termed Magellanic moorland or Magellanic tundra). For example, the northern halves of Hoste and Navarino Islands have Nothofagus antarctica forests but the southern parts consist of moorlands and tundra.

==Worldwide distribution==

===Alpine tree lines===
The alpine tree line at a location is dependent on local variables, such as aspect of slope, rain shadow and proximity to either geographical pole. In addition, in some tropical or island localities, the lack of biogeographical access to species that have evolved in a subalpine environment can result in lower tree lines than one might expect by climate alone.

Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between .

Here is a list of approximate tree lines from locations around the globe:
===Arctic tree lines===

Like the alpine tree lines shown above, polar tree lines are heavily influenced by local variables such as aspect of slope and degree of shelter. In addition, permafrost has a major impact on the ability of trees to place roots into the ground. When roots are too shallow, trees are susceptible to windthrow and erosion. Trees can often grow in river valleys at latitudes where they could not grow on a more exposed site. Maritime influences such as ocean currents also play a major role in determining how far from the equator trees can grow as well as the warm summers experienced in extreme continental climates. In northern inland Scandinavia there is substantial maritime influence on high parallels that keep winters relatively mild, but enough inland effect to have summers well above the threshold for the tree line. Here are some typical polar treelines:

===Antarctic tree lines===
Trees exist on Tierra del Fuego (55°S) at the southern end of South America, but generally not on subantarctic islands and not in Antarctica. Therefore, there is no explicit Antarctic tree line.

Kerguelen Island (49°S), South Georgia (54°S), and other subantarctic islands are all so heavily wind-exposed and with a too-cold summer climate (tundra) that none have any indigenous tree species. The Falkland Islands (51°S) summer temperature is near the limit, but the islands are also treeless, although some planted trees exist.

Antarctic Peninsula is the northernmost point in Antarctica (63°S) and has the mildest weather—it is located from Cape Horn on Tierra del Fuego—yet no trees survive there; only a few mosses, lichens, and species of grass do so. In addition, no trees survive on any of the subantarctic islands near the peninsula.
Southern Rata forests exist on Enderby Island and Auckland Islands (both 50°S) and these grow up to an elevation of in sheltered valleys. These trees seldom grow above in height and they get smaller as one gains altitude, so that by they are waist-high. These islands have only between 600 and 800 hours of sun annually. Campbell Island (52°S) further south is treeless, except for one stunted Spruce, probably planted in 1907. The climate on these islands is not severe, but tree growth is limited by almost continual rain and wind. Summers are very cold with an average January temperature of . Winters are mild but wet. Macquarie Island (Australia) is located at 54°S and has no vegetation beyond snow grass and alpine grasses and mosses.

Per Japanese census data, the population of Samukawa has recently plateaued after a long period of growth.

==History==
The village of Samukawa was founded in 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. It was linked with Chigasaki Station by the Sagami Line in 1921. A spur line extending from Samukawa to the west led to development of housing and industry, increasing the population of Samukawa such that by 1940 it was granted town status. The Sagami Naval Arsenal of the Imperial Japanese Navy was located in Samukawa until the end of World War II. In 2002, a large quantity of mustard gas was found buried under its former site.

==Government==
Samukawa has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 18 members. Samukawa contributes one member to the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Kanagawa 12th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Samukawa has a mixed economy. Industry includes factories operated by Nissan Kohki, a subsidiary of Nissan Motors producing automotive engines.

==Education==
Samukawa has five public elementary schools and three public middle schools operated by the town government. The town has one public high school operated by the Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education
