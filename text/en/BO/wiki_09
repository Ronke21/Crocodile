The province is in the western part of the country in Region 4 and covers . It shares of the border with Iraq, and also bordering on the provinces of Kermanshah, Lorestan, and Khuzestan.

== Etymology ==

==History==

=== Pre-history ===
The name &quot;Ilam&quot; comes from &quot;Elam&quot;, the pre-historic civilization that ruled the area in modern southwest Iran from 2700 BC to 539 BC. Archaeological findings dates human settlement of the area to around 5000 BC.

Ashurbanipal, the then king of Assyria, invaded Elam in 639 BC and totally destroyed it. Although not as united as before, the Elamites survived and continued to live in the area after the invasion. Between 612 and 546 BC, Elam was incorporated into the Median Empire and later into the Achaemenid Empire in 539 BC. During the Achaemenid Empire, Elam lost its independence forever and became the third province of the empire after Persis and Media.

During the reign of the Medes, Achaemenids, Seleucids and Parthians, owing to its proximity to the districts of Hamadan, Kurdistan, Kermanshah, Lorestan and, most notably, Susa, the area and its settlements took on importance.

During the Sassanid era, the present-day Ilam was composed of two states: Mehrjanqazaq in the east, which was the modern day Darreh Shahr and Masbasan in the west.

=== Arab reign ===
After the Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia in 640 AD, the Arabs named the area the &quot;Land of the Mountains,&quot; or &quot;Jibal&quot;. During the Arabs&#x27; rule, the kingdom of Jibal, whose capital was Seymareh, was one of the territories under the control of Baghdad and Basra, and lasted until 961 CE.

The Rashidun Caliphate conquered Mesopotamia by 640 CE and later the whole Sasanid Empire by 643 CE and kept the control until their collapse in 661 CE. Prior to their collapse, civil war had taken over the caliphate, after which Muawiyah faction won and thus established the Umayyad Caliphate. The Umayyad controlled the area until their own collapse in 750 AD, after which the Abbasid Caliphate took over and reigned for around two hundred years until 945 CE. After conquering the western Iran in 945 CE, the Buyid Dynasty ruled over this area until 1055.

=== Kurdish reign ===
For 270 years, between 1155 and 1424, the reigned the Zagros Mountains, especially areas around Lorestan. Hazaraspids who are also known as Lorestan Atabegs were composed of two groups, the Little Lor, who were mostly of Lor descent and Big Lor Atabegs who were of Kurdish descent. The former controlled parts of present-day provinces of Markazi, Hamedan, Kermanshah, Lorestan, Khuzestan and Ilam.

From 961 to 1015, the Ḥasanwayhid dynasty ruled over western Iran under the influence of the Buyid Dynasty. Centred at Dinawar, near present-day Kermanshah, Hasanwyhids, Kurdish Muslims with ties to the Kurdish Barzikani tribe, controlled central areas of the Zagros Mountains. At its greatest extent, the dynasty included the modern-day areas around Khorramabad, Borujerd, Nahavand, Asadabad, Borujerd, Ahwaz, Ilam, Kermanshah, Hulwan and Kirkuk. The Ḥasanwayhid dynasty was overthrown by the Annazids, who, with help of the Buyid dynasty, controlled the area until their collapse in 1116 CE.

=== Khorshidi dynasty ===

The capital of Little Lor was Shapourkhwast or the modern-day Khorramabad, especially the Falak-ol-Aflak Castle. The Little Lor Atabegs or the Khorshidi dynasty ruled over the area for over 412 years, from 1184 to 1597 CE, after which Shah Abbas the Great executed the last ruler, Shahverdi Khan, and replaced Shahverdi&#x27;s nephew, Hossein Beyg/Khan, thus ending the rule of Little Lor and beginning of the Vali/Wali dynasty also known as Feyli Vali.

=== Qajar era (1789–1925) ===
During the Qajar era, Lorestan was divided into two regions: Poshtkoh (present-day Ilam province) with the center of Ilam city and Pishkouh (present-day Lorestan) with the center of Khorramabad. Poshtkhouh literally means “back of mountain” and it was due to the fact that Ilam was situated at the westernmost parts of the Zagros Mountains and to the rest of the country it was plainly considered at the back of mountains.

From that point on, Ilam was ruled independently from Lorestan, and the governor reported directly to the central government, thereby ending Lorestan control of Ilam and Poshtkouh. The two districts were later renamed &quot;Deh-e Bala&quot; and &quot;Deh-e Pa&#x27;een&quot;, which basically means the upper and lower villages. During the rule of Hossein Qoli Khan over &quot;Deh-e Bala&quot; (1863-1900 CE), it was renamed to &quot;Hossein-Abad Poshtkuh&quot;.

The Vali Castle of Ilam was built by the next Vali, Gholamreza Khan Feyli, in 1908. The castle is now a nationally registered heritage and also the Ilam Museum of Anthropology.

=== 20th century ===
Following the establishment of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1925, Reza Shah suppressed the local governments to consolidate his dominance. In 1928, the government forces took over Poshtkouh and Gholamreza Khan Feyli, the last Feyli governor left Poshtkouh with any resistance and went to Iraq, thus abolishing the rule of the Feylis in Ilam after 332 years. A year later, in 1929, &quot;Hossein-Abad&quot; was renamed to &quot;Ilam&quot; by the suggestion of Academy of Persian Language and Literature.

On November 7, 1937, the parliament passed a law on the political division of the country under the title of &quot;Act of Division of the Country and the Duties of the Governors&quot;, thereby dividing the country into 6 provinces and 50 counties. Poshtkouh, being a county, was part of the &quot;West Province&quot;.

The 1937 political division law did not last long and a while later on January 9, 1938, an amendment was passed which divided the country into 10 province and 49 counties. Based on the new division, &quot;Ilam&quot; was a county of the &quot;Fifth Province&quot;.

In 1964, Darreh Shahr, Abdanan and Dehloran from Lorestan province and Mousian from Khuzestan were annexed to Ilam, thus upping its status to &quot;general governorate&quot; as part of the Kermanshah Province. Ilam subsequently became a province in March 1974.

After the Islamic Revolution, Ilam was of the main battlegrounds of the Iran-Iraq war for years. The war began with the Iraqi invasion of western and southwestern parts of Iran on September 22, 1980. As a border province, Ilam was a constant target for the Iraqi bombing campaign and suffered heavily in terms of economic infrastructure. The war left Ilam province devastated for years, making it one of the least developed provinces in Iran.

== Geography ==

Ilam province, with an area of , is the 22nd largest province in Iran. It is located in the southwest of the country, in Central Zagros, and is bordered by Iraq to the west, Khuzestan province to the south, Lorestan province to the east, and Kermanshah province to the north.

Ilam province is situated at the southwestern edge of the Zagros Mountains and right at the transition between the Arabian and the Iranian plateaus. Because of this, it is divided into two distinct natural areas; The northern and eastern parts are mountainous, whereas the southwest is covered with low plains that extend to the Iraqi and Khuzestan borders.

The mountains in the north and east are mostly parallel, running in the northwest–southeast direction. These mountains are separated by plains and rolling hills that are mostly used to grow crops and orchards by settlers.

The most prominent mountain in Ilam province is Kabir Kouh, which is located in the eastern part of the province, stretching 160 km from near Pol-e Zal in the southeast to Mishkhas village near Ilam city in the northwest. The highest point in the province, Kan Seifi peak with above sea level, is part of Kabir Kouh range.

Other major mountains include:
* Manesht and Qolarang near Ilam
* Sharah-Zoul and Bankoul in Eywan
* Qalajeh and Ahuran in Chardavol
* Dinar Kouh, in Abdanan
* Anaran and Siah Kouh in central Dehloran
* Laneh and Charmin near Lumar
* Chaman-Ghir and Sivan near Mishkhas.


Contrary to the north, the south and southwestern part of the province is covered with low-lying plains with elevation varying between above sea level. Despite receiving little precipitation, large areas of these low lands, notably Dehloran, Musian and Dasht Abbas, are cultivated owing to a combination of factors such as rivers flowing from the mountains to the east, dams and irrigation networks.

The Ghamasiab river, after running through Kermanshah province, flows toward Ilam. Upon arriving at the point where the borders of Ilam, Lorestan and Kermanshah provinces meet, it is named Seymareh. It then flows west and southward and somewhere near Kal Sefid Village, Darreh Shahr, is joined by the Kashkan river and together they create the Karkheh river, the third longest river in Iran with a length of around 755 km. Seymareh and Karkheh constitute the Ilam&#x27;s eastern border with Lorestan province.
Because of the terrain, the permanent and seasonal rivers and stream that originate from Ilam highlands either fall into Seymareh, such as Chardavol, Garab, Seekan, Darreh Shahr and Majeen rivers; or, flow westward toward the low lands and into Iraq and Khuzestan, such as Ghanghir, Ghodar-Khosh, Kanjan-Cham, Roud Ghavi, Changouleh Meymeh, Murmuri, Doiraj and Siah Ghav rivers.

Apart from some few springs here and there, such as Siah-Ghav Twin Lakes near Abdanan, there are no major natural bodies of water in the province. There are, however, four dam that provide important drinking water, these include Ilam, Seymareh, Eywan and Doiraj dams.

=== Biodiversity ===

==== Flora ====
With about 31% of its territory covered with scattered to dense forests of mostly Persian oak, Ilam ranks 3rd in the country after Kohgiluyeh and Lorestan provinces, excluding the northern provinces of Mazandarn and Gilan. The highlands and the forests of the province are the habitat of many animals including the Asian black bear, Caracal, Caucasian squirrel, Eastern imperial eagle, Golden eagle, Black kite, Black stork, Blunt-nosed viper, and the endangered Persian leopard. Ilam is home to the endangered Spider-tailed horned viper, a unique species only found in Ilam province in the world.

More than of the province, around 31% of its territory, is covered with scattered to dense forests. This is about one third of the total forests in the Zagros Mountains. The predominant species of these forests are Persian oak, though other trees such as wild almond, hawthorn, Persian turpentine, Montpellier maple and Judas can be found.

The Arghavan Canyon near Ilam is known for the pink blooms of the Judas-trees, which flower in Spring.

==== Fauna ====

Due to its geographical location, natural conditions and the diversity of its habitats, Ilam province is home to 32 mammals and 183 birds. The mountainous areas, specifically, host mammals such as:

* wild goat, Asiatic mouflon, Argali, goitered gazelle
* the endangered Persian leopard and Asiatic cheetah
* as well as Caracal, Eurasian lynx, Asian black bear, Brown bear, wolf, Golden jackal, Red fox and wild boar
* smaller species such as Caucasian squirrel, rabbits, Long-eared hedgehog, European hedgehog, Indian crested porcupine and weasels.

Ilam province is only area in the world in which the spider-tailed horned viper can be found.

=== Nature conservatories ===

About 13% of the total territory of Ilam province is under the protection and monitoring of local and national natural reserves organizations. There are four protected areas, which in total, cover :

In addition to the protected areas mentioned above, there are:

&quot;Tang-e Bina and Bijar&quot; hunting prohibited area: around in area, near Chavar;

&quot;Arghavan Valley forest reserve&quot; near Ilam city: known for its pink spring blossoms of Judas tree; and,

&quot;Largh forest reserve&quot;: known for its Pterocarya fraxinifolia trees. These trees are usually found in the rain forests of Northern Iran, but surprisingly grow in this small patch of land in &quot;Lart Valley&quot; near Badreh.

And two nationally registered natural heritage sites:
* Razyaneh Canyon: a deep and narrow canyon carved by streams in the rock beds near Chenar Bashi, deep, in width, long; and,
* Dehloran: an area near Dehloran that includes hot water and bitumen springs, as well as &#x27;bat caves&#x27;.

=== Landslides ===
One of the largest landslides in the eastern hemisphere and world is believed to have occurred in Ilam Province, more specifically, in the &quot;Kabir Kuh&quot; anticline at Gorz-e Langar in Darreh Shahr county. According to Harrison and Falcon in their article on Royal Geographical Society, published in 1937, the Seymareh landslide moved as much as of rock as far as . It is suspected that an earthquake could have triggered such a large landslide.

=== Climate ===

Due to the influence of various factors such as altitude, proximity to the Arabian desert, the plains of Khuzestan and Iraq, the climate of the province is very diverse.

Different atmospheric systems affect the province, causing fall, winter, spring, and occasionally summer precipitation. The Mediterranean and Black Sea air masses from the west, trigger autumn and winter rains in the province.

The Red Sea and Saudi desert currents, too, bring winter and spring rains. The very same currents and the vast Iraqi plain to the west are the main causes of hot weather in summers. On the other hand, the northern air masses entering the country in winter from Siberia lower the temperatures and cause freezing in northern parts of the province.

Ilam province is considered as one of the tropical regions of the country, but due to difference in altitudes, temperature and precipitation, three different types of climate can be observed:
* Mountainous areas of the north and northeast, which have cold climate and long winters. The minimum temperature in winter reaches and the amount of precipitation exceeds per year.
* The plains of the west and southwest of the province have dry hot climate. The maximum temperature in these areas can exceed . The rainfall in these areas is about per year.
* Other areas have temperature to warm climate with hot summers and mild winters. Temperatures can go as low as in higher altitudes and in summers it can go above in lower altitudes. Annual precipitation in these areas varies between and .
=== Floods ===

Occasional heavy rainstorms in spring and autumn bring, sometimes, huge floods. The steep slopes of Zagros Mountains, soil type, lack of vegetation are among some of the reasons why Ilam province is prone to flooding. Moreover, majority of communities in Ilam province are located in the floodplains, at the foothills of mountains, on river banks and near sources of water, so there is always risk of flooding with potential human and financial costs. According to the available statistics, Mehran and Dehloran counties are at the highest risk of flooding due to their lower elevation compared to the rest of the province and the subsequent concentration and joining of rivers and streams.

The latest flood happened in March and April 2019, in which most of country, including Ilam province, experienced levels of flooding. On April 1, 2019, the flood destructed many bridges including the Gavmishan bridge in Darreh Shahr, an important bridge over Karkheh River which connects south of the province to Lorestan and rest of the country. The bridge was reopened months later on October 6, 2019.

=== Dust ===
Ilam is occasionally affected by dust, especially in summers. It has become more frequent in the last ten years. The cities of Mehran and Dehloran are at the highest risk in the province, due to lower elevation and proximity to the deserts of Iraq and Saudi Arabia. However, in case of large dust storms, the western part of the country could be affected. The successive droughts of the recent decade in Iran and the long wars in Iraq and Syria have also exacerbated the issue.

==Demographics==
===Language and ethnicity===
Ilam Province has a diverse linguistic presence, albeit having the smallest population in Iran. This diversity derives from the geographical location of the province, positioned in the transitional zone between Kurdish and the Southwestern Iranian language bloc. The predominant language is Kurdish, more specifically the Southern Kurdish dialects Kalhori, Elami, Malekshahi, Laki and the Khezeli dialect closely related to Laki. Kurdish is the dominant language in the cities of Ilam, Mehran, Eyvan, Abdanan, Sarableh, Lumar and Pahleh, and Cheshmeh-ye Shirin Shah Ahmad is the southern-most Kurdish-speaking settlement in the province.

Luri is spoken in the southern parts of the province and is the predominant language in Murmuri, Haft Cheshmeh and many smaller villages. The city of Darreh Shahr has a Luri-speaking majority with a significant Kurdish-speaking minority. Two linguistically distinctive Luri dialects called Hinimini and Shuhani are also spoken in the province. Shahrak-e Changuleh is the largest Shuhani-speaking settlement, while Hinimini is spoken in and around Zarangush.

Arabic is spoken in smaller settlements near the border to Khuzestan Province including in Shahrak-e Zu ol Faqari.

==== Kurdish tribes ====
The north is mostly inhabited by the Kurdish Kalhuri and Feyli tribes. The Feyli tribes include the Malekshahi, Khezel, Arkawâzi, Beyrey, Shuhan and Ali Sherwan tribes.

=== Religion ===
As of 2011, 99.62% of the population are Muslim.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the province&#x27;s population was 530,464 in 110,515 households. The following census in 2011 counted 557,599 people in 135,499 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the province as 580,158 people in 159,310 households. Ilam is presently the least populated province in Iran.

=== Administrative divisions ===
The province of Ilam is divided into 12 counties, 28 districts and 52 rural districts. Following the approval of the government cabinet, Holeylan County was established on 4 January 2020, having been a district of Chardavol County prior to that, becoming the 11th county of the province. Chavar District was separated from Ilam County and elevated to county status.

The population history and structural changes of Ilam province&#x27;s administrative divisions over three consecutive censuses are shown in the following table.

=== Cities ===
According to the 2016 census, 395,263 people (over 68% of the population of Ilam province) live in the following cities:

Ilam province is the least populated province in Iran. Ilam, the provincial capital, has a population of 194,030; All other towns have less than 35,000 population.

== Culture ==
The original inhabitants of Ilam were the Guitians and the Kassites, and with the arrival of the Aryans in Iran, the Medes settled in the Zagros region. Throughout history, many people have settled and ruled in the region and as the result, today, Ilam is inhabited by Kurds, Lurs, Laks and Arabs. For the same reasons, the culture of the Ilamians is diverse, mostly a blend of many cultures.

=== Handicrafts ===
Embossed kilim is a combination of simple kilim and carpet knot in its text, which is considered as the most important and original handicraft in Ilam province. Ilam&#x27;s embossed kilim is different from other parts of the country. Upon its creation by Sahar Chalanghar, a resident of Zanjireh village of Sarableh county, Ilam&#x27;s embossed kilim became popular both in Iran and the world. Now, there are more than 4,500 weavers of this specific type of kilim in Ilam province, producing around 3,000m2 annually. It is estimated that around 50% of those involved in all handicrafts work in Ilam province are in the field of kilim production.

&quot;Ilam&#x27;s embossed kilim&quot; is different from other parts of the country because a weaver named &quot;Sahar Chalangar&quot;, a resident of Zanjireh village (one of the functions of Sarablah city of Ilam province), succeeds in performing a prominent role in a part of his woven kilim by using a carpet knot. From this, a background is provided for the growth and promotion of embossed kilims. Ilam&#x27;s embossed kilim has received a national hologram and has been registered as a souvenir and brand of Ilam province. Ilam was subsequently appointed as the national capital of embossed kilim.

=== Cuisine ===

Ilam&#x27;s cuisine, like its culture is a blend of Kurdish and Luri cuisines. Some of the local traditional dishes are:

== Government ==
The highest government authority of the province is the governor-general, who is appointed by the Minister of Interior given cabinet approval. The governor-general, subsequently appoints county governors. The incumbent governor-general is Qasem Soleimani Dashtaki, who has been in office since October 2017.

== Economy ==
With about 0.99% contribution to the national GDP as of 2016, Ilam is one of the least developed provinces in Iran, ranked 26th out of 31. Most economic activities in the province are focused on agriculture and animal husbandry in the rural communities; and, skilled trades, public and private services in urban areas. The industry has a small share in the economy of the province and there are few factories.

=== Agriculture ===

The largest sector of Ilam&#x27;s economy is agriculture, though much smaller compared to other provinces of Iran. There are more than 55,000 farmers in Ilam province. It is estimated that, about 50% of all households in the province are either directly or indirectly involved in agricultural activities.

In 2018 harvest year, of land (11.1% of the territory of Ilam province) were cultivated for various crops such as wheat, barley, forage maize, corn, watermelon, melon and cucumber, producing 700,732 tons of produce in total, 14% through dry farming. Ilam is the bottom 3rd province in the country in terms of crop yield at 3.14 tons per hectare, only surpassing Kohgiluyeh and Kurdestan. For comparison, the average yield is 9.88 tons per hectare and highest is 25.64 tons per hectare in Alborz province.

The farming lands of Ilam, like its geography, are divided; The northern and eastern parts of the province are mountainous and despite the presence of water resources, cultivable lands are limited to inter-mountain plains, foothills and river banks; On the contrary, the hot climate plains of the south and southwest such as Hojandan-Dasht, Amir-Abad, Mehran, Mosian, Dehloran and Dasht-Abbas, are large in size but limited in water resources.

As of 2019, the total area of all orchards in Ilam province was , making it the last in the country. In total, these orchards produced 15,409 tons of fruits, or 0.1% of the country&#x27;s production. The most grown horticultural products are: grapes, walnut, pomegranate, peach, olive and fig.

=== Industry ===

The industry sector of Ilam&#x27;s economy is poorly-developed even non-existent; As of 2017, the total number of industrial workshops (ten or more employees) in the province is just 52, 85% of which have under 50 employees. These workshops have 3,350, almost completely (96%) male, employees in total, accounting to a mere 0.6% of Ilam&#x27;s population. As a comparison, the number of the same type of workshops is 6,806 for Tehran and 3,892 for Isfahan provinces, indicating how underdeveloped Ilam&#x27;s industry sector is. According to the latest statistics, Ilam is the least industrial province in Iran. In recent years, some efforts went into stimulating Ilam&#x27;s industry by building industrial towns and areas, providing encouraging opportunities for businesses such as cheaper land, utilities and tax. Since 2005, 8 such towns and 5 areas have been built.

The largest companies in Ilam province are:

=== Energy ===
With an estimated 14 trillion m3 of gas reserves and 17 billion barrels of oil reserve, equal to 6% and 11% of Iran&#x27;s reserves respectively, Ilam ranks 2nd and 3rd in the country in terms of gas and oil. Ilam province produces more than 230,000 barrels of oil per day and 1.5 billion cubic meters of gas per year, accounting to about 90% of western Iran&#x27;s oil and gas, making Ilam the energy hub of western Iran. The most important oil and gas fields in Ilam are: Dehloran, Tang-e Bijar, Chashmeh Khosh, Paydar-e Gharb, Azar and Danan. Despite the huge oil and gas reserves in the province, there are few downstream processing plants including:
=== Mining ===
Ilam province is part of the Zagros sedimentary structure and is completely covered with sedimentary rocks of different ages. In other words, there are no phenomena of magmatism and metamorphism in the province. Therefore, the province&#x27;s metal mineral reserves are negligible. There are, however, substantial non-metallic reserves of gypsum, limestone, sandstone, dolomite, shale, bitumen, celestine, building stone and facade stone. The province&#x27;s gypsum is more than 99 percent pure and can be found in colossal amounts in Dehloran, Mehran and Bouli of Abdanan. Dehloran Gypsum Factory produces a premium quality product in the country.

The limestone reserves are also very significant in size and very high in purity (93-99.9%). Ilam Cement Factory, founded 1989 to use these mines, produces one of the finest cements in Iran and has won many national and international awards. There are also large amounts of celestine discovered northwest of Dehloran. Celestine is used in oil well drilling industry.

The most valuable mineral in the province is bitumen. It is found as gilsonite and has a purity of more than 70%. Bitumen is found in Eyvan, Dehloran and Malekshahi counties. Ilam province is the 2nd province in the country in terms of production and reserves of bitumen. Eyvan has the largest reserves of bitumen in the province and is considered the largest bitumen mine in the Middle East. Ilam&#x27;s bitumen reserves are estimated at 465,000 tons proven and likely up to 900,000 tons. In some places in the province, liquid bitumen seeps to the ground and creates springs. &quot;Dehloran Bitumen Spring&quot; is a nationally registered natural monument in Iran.

Salt stone has been recovered in Baloutestan area of Zarin Abad. There&#x27;s also veins of blue salt excavated near Dashtalak (Mimak) and Majeen (Darreh Shahr).

Given the geology of the province, building stones can also found in large amounts; White and black marble stone have been discovered near the city of Ilam.

About 2.2 million tons of mineral were excavated in 2019 and Ilam&#x27;s reserves are estimated at around 1 billion tons.

<text>Kerman province () is the largest of the 31 provinces of Iran. Its capital is the city of Kerman.

The province is in the southeast of Iran. In 2014 it was placed in Region 5. Mentioned in ancient times as the Achaemenid satrapy of Carmania, Kerman province has an area of , encompassing nearly 11% of the land area of Iran.

==History==
According to a text from the 8th century commontly attributed to the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi, present-day Kerman province was situated in the southern quarter of the Sasanian Empire. The main city of the region from the Sasanian era to the 10th century was Sirjan.

Early Muslim geographers considered the area as part of the hot climatic zone and the mountainous interior as home of predatory people including the Kufečs (or Kofejān). Hamdallah Mustawfi stated that predatory beasts roamed the area which by then had undergone forestation.

In the 13th century it came under the rule of the Qutlugh-Khanids founded by ethnic Khitans, than under the Mongol Empire. It was under the Timurid empire in 15th century.

==Demographics==
=== Language ===
The main languages of Kerman province are Persian and Garmsiri. Smaller languages include Achomi, Turkic dialects and a Median-type dialect spoken by the Jewish and Zoroastrian communities.

The Persian varieties can be considered one single Kermani accent and they are sufficiently close to Standard Persian which they share intelligibility with.

==Geography==

The altitudes and heights of the province are the continuation of the central mountain ranges of Iran. They extend from the volcanic folds beginning in Azerbaijan and, by branching out in the central plateau of Iran, terminate in Baluchestan. These mountain ranges have brought about vast plains in the province. The Bashagard and Kuhbonan Mountains are the highest in this region and include peaks such as Toghrol, Aljerd, Palvar, Sirach, Abareq and Tahrood. Other ranges that stretch out from Yazd to Kerman and Challeh-ye-Jazmoorian include high peaks like Hazaran which is 4,501 meters above sea level (ASL), Kuh-e Shah 4,402 meters ASL, Joupar, Bahr Aseman and Khabr mountain in Khabr National Park and others.

Most of the province is largely steppe or sandy desert, although there are some oases where dates, oranges (said to be the best in Iran), and pistachios are cultivated. In antiquity &quot;Carmanian&quot; wine was famed for its quality [Strabo XV.2.14 (cap. 726)]. The province is dependent on qanats (underground water channels) for its irrigation. In the central parts, Mount Hezar is the highest peak, 4501 meters above sea level.

Kerman is prone to natural disasters. A recent flood for example, unearthed the archeological ancient city of Jiroft, in the south of Kerman province. Arg-é Bam on the other hand, the world&#x27;s largest adobe structure, was destroyed in an earthquake in December 2003. On February 22, 2005, a major earthquake killed hundreds of residents in the town of Zarand and several nearby villages in north Kerman.

==Economy==
As of 1920, the province was known for the quality of its caraway. Today, Kerman is where a large portion of Iran&#x27;s auto industry is based. Sirjan, a specially designated economic zone, is considered a passageway for transfer of imported commercial goods from the south (through the Persian Gulf). 

Arg e Jadid, is another specially designated economic zone of Iran, located in Kerman province. 

Furthermore, Kerman province is famous for its abundance of pistachio fields both in the city itself and surrounding ones such as Rafsanjan, Ravar and Nooq.
The Gol Gohar mine, the largest iron mine in Iran, is located in Kerman province.

<text>USS &quot;James K. Polk&quot; (SSBN-645), a fleet ballistic missile submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for James K. Polk (1795–1849), the eleventh President of the United States (1845–1849). She was later converted into an attack submarine and redesignated SSN-645.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract for &quot;James K. Polk&quot;″s construction was awarded on 1 November 1962, and her keel was laid down on 23 November 1963 by the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation at Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 22 May 1965, sponsored by Hazel (Hooper) Rivero, wife of Admiral Horacio Rivero, Jr., the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, and commissioned on 16 April 1966 with Commander R.M. Douglass commanding the Gold Crew and Commander F.D. McMullen, Jr., commanding the Blue Crew.

==Service history==

&quot;James K. Polk&quot; sailed to Charleston, South Carolina in September 1966 to load Polaris ballistic missiles for her initial deterrent patrol. After completion of her shakedown, she operated on strategic deterrent patrols in the Atlantic Ocean and completed 19 of them between September 1966 and May 1971.

In July 1971, &quot;James K. Polk&quot; began her first at Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia, for nuclear refueling and conversion of her ballistic missile system to support the Poseidon C-3 ballistic missile. She completed her conversion in late 1972 and commenced a rigorous schedule of sea trials and exercises, culminating in the Demonstration and Shakedown Operation (DASO) of her Poseidon missile system, which tested her ballistic missile system and crew by requiring the launch of a Poseidon C-3 missile from the submarine.

&quot;James K. Polk&quot; resumed deterrent patrols in the Atlantic Ocean in May 1973 with her new Poseidon missiles. She conducted her second overhaul at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, after completing her 50th deterrent patrol in September 1981. She completed overhaul in 1983 and conducted seven more successful deterrent patrols.

&quot;James K. Polk&quot; returned to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in January 1986 for a third overhaul after completing her 58th deterrent patrol. She departed Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in November 1988, then headed south for her post-overhaul DASO. In May 1989 she began her final series of Poseidon strategic deterrent patrols.

&quot;James K. Polk&quot; celebrated her 25th year of commissioned service in April 1991. She finished her 66th and final strategic deterrent patrol in August 1991.

===Conversion to attack submarine===
In August 1992, &quot;James K. Polk&quot; began a nineteen-month shipyard conversion that removed her ballistic missiles and deactivated her missile tubes, converted her into an attack submarine, and installed Dry Deck Shelters on her deck which would allow her to support special warfare operations. Upon completion of this conversion in March 1994, her hull classification symbol was changed from SSBN-645 to SSN-645 to reflect her conversion from a fleet ballistic missile submarine to an attack submarine.

After conversion, &quot;James K. Polk&quot; completed three extended deployments to the Mediterranean Sea, participating in numerous special forces and North Atlantic Treaty Organization exercises.

==Deactivation, decommissioning, and disposal==
On 9 January 1999, &quot;James K. Polk&quot; was deactivated at Norfolk, Virginia. On 8 July 1999, she was decommissioned at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Ship-Submarine Recycling Program was accomplished on 26 April 2000.

==Commemoration==
&quot;James K. Polk&quot;″s sail is on display at the National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

<doc id="448078" wikidata="Q174010" url="?curid=448078" title="Kermanshah province">
<text>Kermanshah province () is one of the 31 provinces of Iran, bordering Iraq. Its capital is the city of Kermanshah.

According to a 2014 segmentation by the Ministry of Interior, it is the center of Region 4, with the region&#x27;s central secretariat located in Kermanshah. 

A majority of people in the province are Shia, and there are Sunni and Yarsani minority groups.

== History ==

The province has a rich Paleolithic heritage. Many caves with Paleolithic remains have been surveyed or excavated there. some of these cave sites are located in Bisetun and north of Kermanshah. The first known physical remains of Neanderthal man in Iran was discovered in Bisitun Cave. Do-Ashkaft Cave, Kobeh, Warwasi, and Mar Tarik are some of the Middle Paleolithic sites in the region. Kermanshah also has many Neolithic sites, of which the most well-known are Ganj Dareh, Sarab, and Asiab. At Ganj Dareh, the earliest evidence for goat domestication have been documented. 

In May 2009, based on a research conducted by the University of Hamedan and UCL, the head of Archeology Research Center of Iran&#x27;s Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization announced that the oldest prehistoric village in the Middle East dating back to 9800 B.C., was discovered in Sahneh, located in west of Kermanshah.

The monuments found in Kermanshah show two glorious periods, the Achaemenid and Sassanid eras. The mythical ruler of the Pishdadian is described as founding the city while Tahmores Divband built it. An alternative narrative is that the construction was by Bahram IV of the Sassanid dynasty during the 4th century CE. Kermanshah reached a peak during the reign of Hormizd IV and Khosrau I of Sassanids, before being demoted to a secondary royal residence.

The city suffered major damage during the Arab invasions but recovered in the Safavid period to make great progress. Concurrent with the Afghan attack and the fall of Isfahan, Kermanshah was almost completely destroyed by the Ottoman invasion.

During the Iran–Iraq War the province suffered heavy fighting. Most towns and cities were badly damaged and some like Sar-e Pol-e Zahab and Qhasr-e-Shirin were almost completely destroyed.

The November 2017 Iran–Iraq earthquake killed more than 600 people.

On 28 December 2017, Kermanshah became one of several Iranian provinces to break out into protests. The Supreme Leader of Iran has blamed western interference. Some female organizations such as The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) have taken partial credit for the organization of these protests.

== Historical attractions ==
Various attractions exist that date from the pre-Islamic era, such as the Kohneh Bridge, to contemporary parks and museums. Some of the more popular sites are:

=== Bisotun ===

: Darius the Great&#x27;s inscription at Bisotun, which dates to 522 BCE, lies some 1300 meters high in the mountains, and counts as one of the most famous sites in Near Eastern archeology. The site is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and has been attracting visitors for centuries. The Behistun inscription is to Old Persian cuneiform what the Rosetta Stone is to Egyptian hieroglyphs: the trilingual inscription (in Old Persian, Elamite and Akkadian) was crucial in the decipherment of the script. The relief above the inscription depicts Darius facing nine rebels who objected to his crowning. At the king&#x27;s feet lies Gaumata. The location of this important historical document is not coincidental: Gaumata, a usurper who is depicted as lying at Darius&#x27; feet, was a Medean and in Achaemenid times Behistun lay on the Medea-Parsa highway.
: Behistun is also notable for three reliefs at the foot of the hill that date from the Parthian era. Among them is a Hellenistic-era depiction of the divinity Bahram as the Greek hero Hercules, who reclines with a goblet in his hand, a club at his feet and a lion-skin beneath him. Because it lies on the route of an ancient highway, this life-size rock sculpture may reflect Bahram&#x27;s status as patron divinity of travelers.

=== Taq-e Bostan ===
: The rock reliefs at Taq-e Bostan lie northeast of Kermanshah, where a spring gushes from a mountain cliff and empties into a large reflecting pool. One of the more impressive reliefs, inside the largest grotto (&quot;ivan&quot;), is the oversized depiction of Sassanid king Khosrau II (591–628 CE), who appears mounted on his favorite charger, Shabdiz. Both the horse and the rider are arrayed in full battle armor.
: There are two hunting scenes on complementary sides of the &quot;ivan&quot;: one depicts an imperial boar hunt and the other depicting the king stalking deer. Elephants flush out the boar from a marshy lake for the king who stands poised with bow and arrow in hand while he is serenaded by female musicians following in other boats. These royal hunting scenes are narrative murals in stone are count among the most vivid of all Iranian rock reliefs.
: The Taq-e Bostan reliefs are not limited to the Sassanid era. An upper relief depicts the 19th century Qajar king Fath-Ali shah holding court.

=== The Kangavar archaeological complex ===
: Kangavar is the site of the archaeological remains of a vast Hellenic-style edifice on a raised platform. The visible remains at the site date to early Sassanid times, but the platform of the complex may be several centuries older. By the time excavation began in 1968, the complex had been preemptorily associated with a comment by Isidore of Charax who referred to a temple of Anahita at Concobar (the Greek name of Kangavar, which was then in Lower Medea). Despite archaeological findings to the contrary, the association with the divinity of fertility, healing, and wisdom has made the site a popular tourist attraction. The vast edifice was built of enormous blocks of dressed stone with an imposing entrance of opposed staircases that may have been inspired by the Apadana in Persepolis.

<doc id="448079" wikidata="Q241119" url="?curid=448079" title="Khuzestan province">
<text>Khuzestan province () is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. Located in the southwest of the country, the province borders Iraq and the Persian Gulf, covering an area of . Its capital is the city of Ahvaz. Since 2014, it has been part of Iran&#x27;s Region 4.

== Etymology ==

Once one of the most critical regions of the Ancient Near East, Khuzestan comprises much of what historians refer to as ancient Elam, whose capital was in Susa. The Old Persian term for Elam was when they conquered it from the Elamites. This element is present in the modern name. Khuzestan, meaning &quot;the Land of the Khuz,&quot; refers to the original inhabitants of this province. In the Achaemenid Empire, this term is &quot;Huza&quot; or &quot;Huja&quot;, as in the inscription on the tomb of Darius the Great at Naqsh-e Rostam. They are the &quot;Shushan&quot; of Hebrew sources, a borrowing from Elamite &quot;Šuša&quot;. In Middle Persian, the term evolved into &quot;Khuz&quot; and &quot;Kuzi.&quot; The pre-Islamic Partho-Sasanian inscriptions give the province the name Khwuzestan. The name of the city of Ahvaz also has the same origin as the name Khuzestan, being an Arabic broken plural from the compound name, &quot;Suq al-Ahvaz&quot; &quot;Market of the Huzi&quot;. This was the medieval name of the town that replaced the pre-Islamic name.

The entire province was still known as &quot;the Khudhi&quot; or &quot;the Khuji&quot; until the reign of the Safavid king Tahmasp I (r. 1524–1576) and, in general, the course of the 16th century. The southern half of the province—south, southwest of the Ahvaz Ridge, had come by the 17th century to be known, at least to the imperial Safavid chancery, as &quot;Arabistan&quot;. A contemporaneous history, the &quot;Tarikh-e Alam-ara-ye Abbasi&quot; by Iskandar Beg Munshi, written during the reign of Abbas the Great (r. 1588–1629), regularly refers to the southern part of Khuzestan as &quot;Arabistan&quot;. The northern half continued to be called Khuzestan. In 1925, the entire province regained its old name, and the term Arabistan was dropped.

There is also a very old folk etymology which maintains the word &quot;khuz&quot; stands for sugar and &quot;Khuzi&quot; for people who make raw sugar. The province has been a cane sugar-producing area since the late Sassanian times, such as the sugar cane fields of the Dez River side in Dezful. Khuzhestanis cultivate sugarcane even today in Haft Tepe. The province&#x27;s name in Syriac is Beth Huzaye.

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===
The province of Khuzestan is one of the centres of ancient civilization, and one of the most important regions of the Ancient Near East, based around Susa. The first large scale empire based here was that of the powerful 4th millennium BC Elamites.

Archeological ruins verify the entire province of Khuzestan to be home to the Elamite civilization, a non-Semitic, and non-Indo-European-speaking kingdom, and
&quot;the earliest civilization of Persia&quot;. The name &quot;Khuzestan&quot; is derived from the Elamite (&quot;ʰŪvja&quot;), likely pronounced /xuʒa/, later Middle Persian &quot;Hūzīg&quot;, Arabic &quot;al-Xūzīya&quot;.

In fact, in the words of Elton L. Daniel, the Elamites were &quot;the founders of the first &#x27;Iranian&#x27; empire in the geographic sense.&quot; Hence the central geopolitical significance of Khuzestan, the seat of Iran&#x27;s first empire.

In 640 BC, the Elamites were defeated by Ashurbanipal, coming under the rule of the Assyrians who brought destruction upon Susa and Chogha Zanbil. But in 538 BC, Cyrus the Great was able to re-conquer the Elamite lands after nearly 80 years of Median rule. The city of Susa was then proclaimed as one of the Achaemenid capitals. Darius the Great then erected a grand palace known as &quot;Apadana&quot; there in 521 BC. But this astonishing period of glory and splendor of the Achaemenian dynasty came to an end by the conquests of Alexander of Macedon. The Susa weddings was arranged by Alexander in 324 BC in Susa, where mass weddings took place between the Persians and the Macedonians. After Alexander, the Seleucid dynasty came to rule the area.

As the Seleucid dynasty weakened, Mehrdad I the Parthian (171–137 BC), gained ascendency over the region. During the Sassanid dynasty this area thrived tremendously and flourished, and this dynasty was responsible for the many constructions that were erected in Ahvaz, Shushtar, and the north of Andimeshk.

During the early years of the reign of Shapur II (AD 309 or 310–379), Arabs crossed the Persian Gulf from Bahrain to &quot;Ardashir-Khora&quot; of Fars and raided the interior. In retaliation, Shapur II led an expedition through Bahrain, defeated the combined forces of the Arab tribes of &quot;Taghleb&quot;, &quot;Bakr bin Wael&quot;, and &quot;Abd Al-Qays&quot; and advanced temporarily into Yamama in central Najd. The Sassanids resettled these tribes in Kerman and Ahvaz. Arabs named Shapur II, as &quot;Shabur Dhul-aktāf&quot; after this battle.

The existence of prominent scientific and cultural centers such as Academy of Gundishapur which gathered distinguished medical scientists from Egypt, the Byzantine Empire, and Rome, shows the importance and prosperity of this region during this era. The Jondi-Shapur Medical School was founded by the order of Shapur I. It was repaired and restored by Shapur II (a.k.a. &quot;Zol-Aktaf&quot;: &quot;The Possessor of Shoulder Blades&quot;) and was completed and expanded during the reign of Anushirvan.

=== Muslim conquest of Khuzestan ===
The Muslim conquest of Khuzestan took place in 639 AD under the command of Abu Musa al-Ash&#x27;ari from Basra, who drove the Persian satrap Hormuzan out of Ahvaz. Susa later fell, so Hormuzan fled to Shushtar. There his forces were besieged by Abu Musa for 18 months. Shushtar finally fell in 642 AD; the Khuzistan Chronicle records that an unknown Arab, living in the city, befriended a man in the army, and dug tunnels through the wall in return for a third of the spoil. The Basrans purged the Nestorians—the Exegete of the city and the Bishop of Hormizd, and all their students—but kept Hormuzan alive.

There followed the conquests of Gundeshapur and of many other districts along the Tigris. The Battle of Nahāvand finally secured Khuzestan for the Muslim armies.

During the Muslim conquest the Sassanids were allied with non-Muslim Arab tribes, which implies that those wars were religious, rather than national. For instance in 633–634, Khaled ibn Walid leader of the Muslim Army, defeated a force of the Sassanids&#x27; Arab auxiliaries from the tribes of Bakr, &#x27;Ejl, Taghleb and Namer at &#x27;Ayn Al-Tamr.

The Muslim settlements by military garrisons in southern Iran was soon followed by other types of expansion. Some families, for example, took the opportunity to gain control of private estates. Like the rest of Iran, the Muslim conquest thus brought Khuzestan under the rule of the Arabs of the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, until Ya&#x27;qub bin Laith as-Saffar, from southeastern Iran, raised the flag of independence once more, and ultimately regained control over Khuzestan, among other parts of Iran, founding the short-lived Saffarid dynasty. From that point on, Iranian dynasties would continue to rule the region in succession as an important part of Iran.

In the Umayyad period, large groups of nomads from the &quot;Hanifa&quot;, &quot;Banu Tamim&quot;, and &quot;Abd al-Qays&quot; tribes crossed the Persian Gulf and occupied some of the richest Basran territories around Ahvaz and in Fars during the Second Fitna in 661–665 / 680–684 AD.

During the Abbasid period, in the second half of the 10th century, the &quot;Assad&quot; tribe, taking advantage of quarrels under the Buwayhids, penetrated into Khuzestan, where a group of &quot;Tamim&quot; had been living since pre-Islamic times. However, following the fall of the Abbasid dynasty, the flow of Arab immigrants into Persia gradually diminished, but it nonetheless continued. In the latter part of the 16th century, the &quot;Bani Kaab&quot; (pronounced Chaub in the local Gulf dialect), from Kuwait, settled in Khuzestan. And during the succeeding centuries, more Arab tribes moved from southern Iraq to Khuzestan.

===Qajar period===
According to C.E. Bosworth in &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;, under the Qajar dynasty &quot;the province was known, as in Safavid times, as Arabistan, and during the Qajar period was administratively a governor-generalate.&quot; Half of Khuzestan was not known as Arabistan. Khuzestan&#x27;s northern, more populous parts, with the capital at Shushtar, retained the old name, but also occasionally was incorporated into the district of the Greater Lur due to the large Bakhtiari population in half of Khuzestan.

In 1856, in the course of the Anglo-Persian War over the city of Herat, the British naval forces sailed up the Karun river all the way to Ahvaz. However, in the settlement that followed, they evacuated the province. Some tribal forces, such as those led by Sheikh Jabir al-Kaabi, the Sheikh of Mohammerah, fared better in opposing the invading British forces than those dispatched by the central government, which was quite feeble. But, the point of the invasion of the province and other coastal regions of southern Persia/Iran were to force the evacuation of Herat by the Persians and not the permanent occupation of these regions.

===Pahlavi era===

In the two decades before 1925, although nominally part of Persian territory, the western part of Khuzestan functioned for many years effectively as an autonomous emirate known as &quot;Arabistan&quot;. The eastern part of Khuzestan was governed by Bakhtiari khans. Following Sheikh Khazʽal Ibn Jabir&#x27;s rebellion, the western part of Khuzestan&#x27;s emirate was dissolved by Reza Shah government in 1925, along with other autonomous regions of Persia, in a bid to centralize the state. In response Sheikh Khaz&#x27;al of Muhammerah initiated a rebellion, which was quickly crushed by the newly installed Pahlavi dynasty with minimal casualties. A low level conflict between the central Iranian government and the Arab nationalists of the province continued since.

The name of &#x27;Khuzistan&#x27; came to be applied to the entire territory by 1936. Over the next decades of the Pahlavi rule, the province of Khuzestan remained relatively quiet, gaining to hold an important economic and defensive strategic position.

===Islamic Republic===
====After the revolution====
With the Iranian Revolution taking place in early 1979, local rebellions swept the country, with Khuzestan being no exception. In April 1979, an uprising broke out in the province, led by the Arab separatist group Arab Political and Cultural Organisation (APCO), seeking to gain independence from the new theocratic rule.

The Iranian Embassy siege of 1980 in London was initiated by an Arab separatist group as an aftermath response to the regional crackdown in Khuzestan, after the 1979 uprising. Initially it emerged the terrorists wanted autonomy for Khuzestan; later they demanded the release of 91 of their comrades held in Iranian jails.
The group which claimed responsibility for the siege &quot;the Arab Popular Movement in Arabistan&quot; (See Arab separatism in Khuzestan) gave a number of press conferences in the following months, referring to what it described as &quot;the racist rule of Khomeini&quot;. It threatened further international action as part of its campaign to gain self-rule for Khuzestan. But its links with Baghdad served to undermine its argument that it was a purely Iranian opposition group; there were allegations that it was backed by Iran&#x27;s regional rival, Iraq. Their leader (&quot;Salim&quot; – Awn Ali Mohammed) along with four other members of the group were killed and the fifth member, Fowzi Badavi Nejad, was sentenced to life imprisonment.

====Iran–Iraq war====
During the Iran–Iraq War, Khuzestan was the focus of the Iraqi invasion of Iran, leading to the flight of thousands of the province&#x27;s residents. As a result, Khuzestan suffered the heaviest damage of all Iranian provinces during the war. Iraq&#x27;s President Saddam Hussein felt confident that the Arab population of the Khuzestan would react enthusiastically to the prospect of union with Iraq. However, resistance to the invasion was fierce, stalling the Iraqi military&#x27;s advance, and ultimately opening a window of opportunity for an Iranian counter-offensive.

What used to be Iran&#x27;s largest refinery at Abadan was destroyed, never to fully recover. Many of the famous &quot;nakhlestans&quot; (palm groves) were annihilated, cities were destroyed, historical sites were demolished, and nearly half the province captured by the invading Iraqi army. This created a mass exodus into other provinces that did not have the logistical capability of taking in such a large number of refugees.

However, by 1982, Iranian forces managed to push Iraqi forces out of Iran. The Battle of Khorramshahr (one of Khuzestan&#x27;s largest cities and the most important Iranian port prior to the war) was a turning point in the war, and is officially celebrated every year in Iran.

The city of Khorramshahr was almost completely destroyed as a result of the scorched earth policy ordered by Iraq&#x27;s leader, Saddam Hussein. However, Iranian forces were able to prevent the Iraqis from attempting to spread the execution of this policy to other major urban centres.

From 22 September 1980 to the last day of the war, this province was always the scene of Iran&#x27;s various operations to recapture the areas occupied by the Iraqi army forces. At the beginning of the war, cities such as Abadan, Susangerd, Bostan, Dezful, Andimeshk, Khorramshahr, and Ahvaz, which were the capital of the province, were regularly targeted by Iraqi army rocket and artillery attacks. The long-term occupation of some areas of the province, further contributed to the damage to natural and human capital in the province.

Since the war, the speed of growth and development of the province has been very slow. Khuzestan, despite benefiting from abundant natural resources including oil, has many economic, environmental, social, and construction problems, among others. High unemployment rate, water crisis, high dust, and lack of civil infrastructure are among the factors that sparked high dissatisfaction among residents. The frustrations typically manifested in protests and rallies.

====2005–present====
In 2005, Ahvaz witnessed a number of terrorist attacks, which came following the violent Ahvaz riots. The first bombing came ahead of the presidential election on 12 June 2005. In 2011, another wave of protests by Arab tribes occurred mostly in the urban area of Ahvaz. Before the Iran–Iraq War of the 1980s, the Arabs of Khuzestan mostly resided in the rural regions along the Karkhe and Karun rivers in the southwest of the province and the number living in cities was very limited because the Arab tribes were still following a nomadic lifestyle. But after the end of the war, most of the refuged Arabs were relocated by the government to the urban centres and smaller towns. This conversion of lifestyle directly from nomadic to city life caused many problems and conflicts in the structure of their societies and ultimately has led to some unrest. An unfinished building collapsed in Khuzestan province in June 2022. It was reported that thirteen people were arrested over the collapse. The incident also caused demonstrations in the region.

==Demographics==
=== Languages ===
Apart from Persian, other languages and dialects are also spoken in Khuzestan. For instance, a portion of Khuzestan&#x27;s populace speaks Arabic (Khuzestani Arabic). Another part of Khuzestanis speak in Bakhtiari dialect. Neo-Mandaic is spoken by no more than a few dozen elderly Mandaeans.

===Ethnicity===
Khuzestan is known for its ethnic diversity; the population of Khuzestan consists of Lurs, Arabs, Qashqai people of the Afshar tribe, Persians (Dezfuli-Shushtari, Mahshahrys, Behbahani),Mandean, Kurds and Iranian Armenians. Khuzestan&#x27;s population is predominantly Shia Muslim, but there are small Christian, Jewish, Sunni and Mandean minorities.

During a research that was commissioned by the General Culture Council in 2010 and based on a field survey and a statistical community among the residents of 288 cities and about 1400 villages across the country, the percentage of ethnic groups that were sampled in this survey in this province was as follows. Arabs was 33.6%. Persians 32.2%, Lurs 30%, Turkish speakers 2.5%, Kurds 1%, Other 0.7%.

===Population===
According to the 1996 census, the province had an estimated population of 3.7 million people, of which approximately 62.5% were in the urban centres, 36.5% were rural dwellers and the remaining 1% were non-residents. According to the most recent census taken in 2016, the province had 4,710,509 inhabitants.

At the time of the 2006 National Census, the province&#x27;s population was 4,192,598 in 862,491 households. The following census in 2011 counted 4,531,720 people in 1,112,664 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the province as 4,710,509 in 1,280,645 households.

=== Administrative divisions ===
The population history and structural changes of Khuzestan province&#x27;s administrative divisions over three consecutive censuses are shown in the following table.

=== Cities ===
According to the 2016 census, 3,554,205 people (over 75% of the population of Khuzestan province) live in the following cities:

==Overview==
The seat of the province has for most of its history been in the northern reaches of the land, first at Susa (Shush) and then at Shushtar. During a short spell in the Sasanian era, the capital of the province was moved to its geographical center, where the river town of Hormuz-Ardasher, founded over the foundation of the ancient Hoorpahir by Ardashir I, the founder of the Sasanian Dynasty in the 3rd century CE. This town is now known as Ahvaz. However, later in the Sasanian time and throughout the Islamic era, the provincial seat returned and stayed at Shushtar, until the late Qajar period. With the increase in the international sea commerce, arriving on the shores of Khuzistan, Ahvaz became a more suitable location for the provincial capital. The River Karun is navigable all the way to Ahvaz (above which, it flows through rapids). The town was thus refurbished by the order of the Qajar king, Naser al-Din Shah and renamed after him, Nâseri. Shushtar quickly declined, while Ahvaz/Nâseri prospered to the present day.

Since the early 1920s, tensions on religious and ethnic grounds have often resulted in separatist violence, including an insurgency in 1979, an embassy siege, unrest in 2005, bombings in 2005–06 and protests in 2011. The Iranian regime has drawn harsh criticism from international human rights organizations for its repressive measures against the religious and ethnic minorities in the region. However, the internal conflict was brought to a temporary halt in 1980 when Khuzestan was invaded by Ba&#x27;athist Iraq, leading to the Iran–Iraq War where Khuzestanis of all backgrounds fought alongside the Iranian military in resisting the Iraqi offensive. Currently, Khuzestan has 18 representatives in Iran&#x27;s parliament, the Majlis. Meanwhile, it has six representatives in the Assembly of Experts, including Ayatollahs Mousavi Jazayeri, Ka&#x27;bi, Heidari, Farhani, Shafi&#x27;i, and Ahmadi.

== Geography and climate ==
The province of Khuzestan can be basically divided into two regions; the rolling hills and mountainous regions north of the Ahvaz Ridge, and the plains and marsh lands to its south. The area is irrigated by the &quot;Karoun&quot;, &quot;Karkheh&quot;, &quot;Jarahi&quot; and &quot;Maroun&quot; rivers. The northern section maintains a non-Persian Bakhtiari minority, while the southern section always had diverse minority groups known as Khuzis. Since the 1940s, a flood of job seekers from all over Iran to the oil and commerce centers on the Persian Gulf Coast has made the region more Persian-speaking. Presently, Khuzestan still maintains its diverse group, but does have Arabs, Persians, Bakhtiari and ethnic Qashqais and Lors.

Khuzestan has great potential for agricultural expansion, which is almost unrivaled by the country&#x27;s other provinces. Large and permanent rivers flow over the entire territory contributing to the fertility of the land. Karun, Iran&#x27;s most effluent river, 850 kilometers long, flows into the Persian Gulf through this province. The agricultural potential of most of these rivers, however, and particularly in their lower reaches, is hampered by the fact that their waters carry salt, the amount of which increases as the rivers flow away from the source mountains and hills. In case of the Karun, a single tributary river, Rud-i Shur (&quot;Salty River&quot;) that flows into the Karun above Shushtar contributes most of the salt that the river carries. As such, the freshness of the Karun waters could be greatly enhanced if the Rud-i Shur could be diverted away from the Karun. The same applies to the Jarahi and Karkheh in their lower reaches. Only the Marun is exempt from this.

The climate of Khuzestan is generally very hot and occasionally humid, particularly in the south, while winters can be cold and dry. Summertime temperatures routinely exceed almost daily and in the winter it can drop below freezing, with occasional snowfall in mountains. Khuzestan is one of the hottest places on earth with maximum temperatures in summer exceeding sometimes. Reliable measurements in the city range from . Khuzestan has desert conditions and experiences many sandstorms.

== Water ==
Iran ranks among the most water stressed countries in the world. However, Khuzestan province suffers from major water problems that were aggravated by corruption in Iran&#x27;s water supply sector, lack of transparency, neglect of marginalized communities, and political favoritism. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other politically connected entities control water resources, prioritizing projects for political and economic gain rather than public need. They divert supplies to favored regions, causing shortages in vulnerable provinces like Khuzestan and Sistan-Baluchestan. For example, water diversion projects in Isfahan and Yazd provinces receive priority despite critical shortages in Khuzestan and Sistan-Baluchestan. Reports also indicate that certain agricultural and industrial enterprises with ties to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps have received significant amounts of water, while small farmers and rural communities struggle with severe shortages.

Iran&#x27;s central government prioritizes water allocation for industrial and urban centers, often at the expense of rural and minority populations. These groups face severe water shortages, ecological degradation, and a loss of livelihoods. This pattern of unequal development not only exacerbates regional disparities but also fuels social unrest and environmental crises. Iran&#x27;s water policy is also characterized by an overreliance on dam construction and large-scale diversion projects, primarily benefiting politically connected enterprises and urban elites. This has led to the drying of rivers, wetlands, and other vital ecosystems, intensifying dust storms and land subsidence in regions like Khuzestan and Sistan-Baluchestan. Such environmental degradation, combined with insufficient governmental oversight and transparency, worsens living conditions for marginalized communities, reinforcing cycles of poverty and socio-political marginalization.

=== Migration from Khuzestan province ===
Historically, Khuzestan, one of Iran&#x27;s most water-rich provinces, has been hit hard by the mismanagement of water resources. The drying of rivers, including the Karkheh and Karun, has made agriculture unsustainable in many parts of the province. In recent years, Khuzestan has witnessed a significant exodus of its rural population as people move to cities for work and better living conditions. The situation has been exacerbated by periodic dust storms, which further degrade the environment and make life untenable in affected regions. This environmental migration from Khuzestan has led to social tensions in the region, as local communities face declining living standards and heightened unemployment.

==Politics==

Khuzestan is ethnically diverse, home to many different ethnic groups. This has a bearing on Khuzestan&#x27;s electoral politics, with ethnic minority rights playing a significant role in the province&#x27;s political culture. The province&#x27;s geographical location bordering Iraq and its oil resources also make it a politically sensitive region, particularly given its history of foreign intervention, notably the Iraqi invasion of 1980.

Some ethnic groups complain over the distribution of the revenue generated by oil resources with claims that the central government is failing to invest profits from the oil industry in employment generation, post-war reconstruction and welfare projects. Low human development indicators among local Khuzestanis are contrasted with the wealth generation of the local oil industry. Minority rights are frequently identified with strategic concerns, with ethnic unrest perceived by the Iranian government as being generated by foreign governments to undermine the country&#x27;s oil industry and its internal stability. The politics of Khuzestan therefore have international significance and go beyond the realm of electoral politics.

According to Jane&#x27;s Information Group, &quot;Most Iranian Arabs seek their constitutionally guaranteed rights and do not have a separatist agenda. ... While it may be true that some Arab activists are separatists, most see themselves as Iranians first and declare their commitment to the state&#x27;s territorial integrity.&quot;

== Culture ==
=== In literature ===
Khuzestan has long been the subject of many a writer and poet of Persia, banking on its ample sugar production to use the term as allegory for sweetness. Some popular verses are:

&quot;Her lips aflow with sweet sugar,
The sweet sugar that aflows in Khuzestan.&quot;
&quot;Nizami&quot;

&quot;Your graceful figure like the cypress in Kashmar,
Your sweet lips like the sugar of Khuzestan.&quot;
&quot;Nizari Qohistani&quot;

&quot;So Sām hath not need ride afar
from Ahvaz up to Qandehar.&quot;
&quot;Ferdosi&quot;

=== Traditions and religion ===

The people of Khuzestan are predominantly Shia Muslims, with small Sunni Muslim, Jewish, Christian, and Mandaean minorities. Khuzestanis are also very well regarded for their hospitality and generosity.

=== Cuisine ===

Seafood is the most important part of Khuzestani cuisine, but many other dishes are also featured. The most popular Khuzestani dish is &quot;Ghalyeh Mahi&quot;, a fish dish that is prepared with heavy spices, onions and cilantro. The fish used in the dish is locally known as &quot;mahi soboor&quot; (shad fish), a species of fish found in the Persian Gulf. Other provincial specialties include &quot;Ghalyeh Meygu&quot; (&quot;shrimp casserole&quot;), &quot;ashe-mohshala&quot; (a Khorramshahri breakfast stew), &quot;sær shir&quot; (a Dezfuli breakfast of heavy cream), &quot;hælim&quot; (a Shushtari breakfast of wheatmeal with shredded lamb), and &quot;kohbbeh&quot; (a deep-fried rice cake with ground beef filling and other spices of Arabic origin, a variant on Levantine kibbeh).

=== Historical figures ===
Many scientists, philosophers, and poets have come from Khuzestan, including Abu Nuwas, Abdollah ibn-Meymun Ahvazi, the astronomer Nowbækht-e Ahvazi and his sons as well as Jorjis, the son of Bakhtshua Gondishapuri, Ibn Sakit, Da&#x27;bal-e Khazai and Sheikh Mortedha Ansari, a prominent Shi&#x27;a scholar from Dezful.

=== Attractions of Khuzestan ===
Iran National Heritage Organization lists 140 sites of historical and cultural significance in Khuzestan, reflecting the fact that the province was once the seat of Iran&#x27;s most ancient empire.

Some of the more popular sites of attraction include:

* Choqa Zanbil: The seat of the Elamite Empire, this ziggurat is a magnificent five-story temple that is one of the greatest ancient monuments in the Middle-East today. The monolith, with its labyrinthine walls made of thousands of large bricks with Elamite inscription, manifest the sheer antiquity of the shrine. The temple was religiously sacred and built in the honor of Inshushinak, the protector deity of the city of Susa.
* &quot;Shush-Daniel&quot;: Burial site of the Jewish prophet Daniel. He is said to have died in Susa on his way to Jerusalem upon the order of Darius. The grave of Ya&#x27;qub bin Laith as-Saffar, who rose against the oppression of the Umayyad Caliphate, is also located nearby.
* Dezful (&quot;Dezh-pol&quot;), whose name is taken from a bridge (&quot;pol&quot;) over the Dez river having 12 spans built by the order of Shapur I. This is the same bridge that was called &quot;Andamesh Bridge&quot; by historians such as Istakhri who says the city of Andimeshk takes its name from this bridge. Muqaddasi called it &quot;The City of the Bridge.&quot;
* Shushtar, home to the famous Shushtar Watermills and one of the oldest fortress cities in Iran, known as the &quot;City of Forty Elders&quot; in local dialect. In and around Shushtar, there are many displays of ancient hydraulic engineering. There are also the Band Mizan and Band Qeysar, 2000-year-old dams on the Karoun river and the famous Shadervan Bridge which is over 2000 years old. The Friday Mosque of Shushtar was built by the Abbasids. The mosque, which features &quot;Roman&quot; arches, has 54 pillars and balconies.
* Izeh, or &quot;Izaj&quot;, was one of the main targets of the invading Islamic army in their conquest of Persia. &quot;Kharezad Bridge&quot;, one of the strangest bridges of the world, was situated in this city and was named after Ardeshir Babakan&#x27;s mother. It is built over cast pillars of lead each 104 meters high. Ibn Battuta, who visited the city in the 14th century, refers to many monasteries, caravanserais, aqueducts, schools, and fortresses in the town. The brass statue of &quot;The Parthian Man&quot;, kept at the National Museum of Iran, is from here.
* Masjed Soleiman, another ancient town, has ancient fire altars and temples such as &quot;Sar-masjed&quot; and &quot;Bard-neshondeh&quot;. It is also the winter&#x27;s resting area of the Bakhtiari tribe, and where William Knox D&#x27;Arcy dug Iran&#x27;s first oil well.
* Abadan is said to be where the tomb of Elijah, the long lived Hebrew prophet is.
* &quot;Iwan of Hermes&quot;, and &quot;Iwan of Karkheh&quot;, two enigmatic ruins north of Susa.

== Economy ==

Khuzestan is the major oil-producing region of Iran, and as such is one of the wealthiest provinces in Iran. Khuzestan ranks third among Iran&#x27;s provinces in GDP.

In 2005, Iran&#x27;s government announced it was planning the country&#x27;s second nuclear reactor to be built in Khuzestan province. The 360 MW reactor will be a light water PWR Reactor.

Khuzestan is also home to the Arvand Free Trade Zone. It is one of six economic Free Trade Zones in Iran, including the PETZONE (Petrochemical Special Economic Zone in Mahshahr).

=== Shipping ===
The Karun River is the only navigable river in Iran. The British, up until recent decades, after the discovery by Austen Henry Layard, transported their merchandise via Karun&#x27;s waterways, passing through Ahvaz all the way up to Langar near Shushtar, and then sent by road to Masjed Soleimanthe site of their first oil wells in the Naftoon oil field. Karoun is capable of the sailing of fairly large ships as far up as Shushtar.

Karkheh, Jarrahi, Arvandrood, Handian, Shavoor, Bahmanshir (Bahman-Ardeshir), Maroon-Alaa&#x27;, Dez, and many other rivers and water sources in the form of &quot;Khurs&quot;, lagoons, ponds, and marshes demonstrate the vastness of water resources in this region, and are the main reason for the variety of agricultural products developed in the area.
=== Agriculture ===
The abundance of water and the fertility of the soil have made this region a rich and well-endowed land. The variety of agricultural products such as wheat, barley, oilseeds, rice, eucalyptus, medicinal herbs; the existence of many palm and citrus farms; the proximity of mountains suitable for raising olives, and of course sugar cane—from which Khuzestan takes its name—all show the great potential of this fertile region. In 2005, 51,000 hectares of land were planted with sugar canes, producing 350,000 tons of sugar. The abundance of water supplies, rivers, and dams, also have an influence on the fishery industries, which are prevalent in the area.

The Abadan island is an important area for the production of datepalms, but it has suffered from the invasion of the Iraqi army during the Iran–Iraq War. The palm groves are irrigated by tidal irrigation. At high tide, the waterlevel in the rivers is set up and the river flow enters the irrigation canals that have been dug from the river towards the inland plantations. At low tide, the canals drain the unused part of the water back to the river.

=== Industry ===

There are several cane sugar mills in Khuzestan province, among them &quot;Haft Tepe&quot; and &quot;Karun Agro Industry&quot; near Shushtar.

The Karun 3 and 4, and Karkheh Dam, as well as the petroleum reserves provide Iran with national sources of revenue and energy. The petrochemical and steel industries, pipe making, the power stations that feed the national electricity grid, the chemical plants, and the large refineries are some of Iran&#x27;s major industrial facilities.

===Oil===
The province is also home to Yadavaran Field, which is a major oil field in itself and part of the disputed Al-Fakkah Field. Khuzestan holds 80% of Iran&#x27;s onshore oil reserves, and thus 57% of Iran&#x27;s total oil reserves, making it indispensable to the Iranian economy.

<text>Qazvin province (; ) is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. It is in the northwest of the country, with the city of Qazvin as its capital.

The province was carved out of Tehran and Zanjan provinces in 1993. The province was made a part of Region 1 upon the division of the provinces into 5 regions solely for coordination and development purposes on June 22, 2014.

==History==

Qazvin was the location of a former capital of the Persian Empire and contains over 2000 architectural and archeological sites. It is a provincial capital today that has been a cultural center of mass throughout history.

Archeological findings in the Qazvin plain reveal the existence of urban agricultural settlements as far back as 7000 BC. The name “Qazvin” or “Kasbin” is derived from Cas, an ancient tribe that lived south of the Caspian Sea millennia ago. The Caspian Sea itself in fact derives its name from the same origin. Qazvin geographically connects Tehran, Isfahan, and the Persian Gulf to the Caspian seacoast and Asia Minor, hence its strategic location throughout the ages.

Qazvin has been a hotbed of historical developments in Iranian history. In the early years of the Islamic era Qazvin served as a base for the Muslim forces. Destroyed by Genghis Khan (13th century), the Safavid monarchs made Qazvin the capital of the Safavid empire in 1548 only to have it moved to Isfahan in 1598. During the Qajar dynasty and contemporary period, Qazvin has always been one of the most important governmental centers due to its proximity to Tehran. Abbas Mirza, a Crown Prince and Minister of Commerce, was also the governor of Qazvin.

Qazvin is situated close to Alamut, where the famous Hasan-i Sabbah, founder of the secret Ismaili order of the Assassins, operated from.

Qazvin is where the coup d&#x27;état of General Reza Khan, with his Russian-trained Cossack brigade, was launched from – which led to the founding of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1921.

1962 Buin Zahra earthquake killed 12.225 people.

==Demographics==
===Language and ethnicity===
The majority of people in the northeast of the province, in Alamut, are Mazandarani or Gilaks who speak a dialect of the Mazandarani or Gilaki language. However, other sources claim that the majority of people in Alamut are ‘Tats’.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the province&#x27;s population was 1,127,734 in 294,305 households. The following census in 2011 counted 1,201,565 inhabitants living in 352,472 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the province as 1,273,761 people in 397,165 households.

===Historical mosques===
After Islam, the abundant attendance of mystics (ascetics), as well as the prevalence of tradition (Hadith), religious jurisprudence (Fegh´h), and philosophy in Qazvin, led to the emergence of many mosques and religious schools among which the most magnificent ones are:

<text>Qom province () is one of the 31 provinces of Iran with 11,237 km², covering 0.89% of the total area of the country. Its capital is the city of Qom.

The province is in the central part of the country and was formed from part of Tehran province in 1995. The province was designated as part of Region 1 following the division of Iranian provinces into 5 regions which took place on June 22, 2014, for the purposes of coordination and development.

==History==
Qom is thought to have existed in pre-Islamic ages. Archeological discoveries indicate Qom as a residential area from the 5th millennium BCE. According to the pre-Islamic remaining relics and historical texts, Qom was a large city. &#x27;Kom&#x27; was the name of the ancient rampart of the city of Qom, thus, the Arabs called it Qom during the Arab conquests of Iran.

It was during the reign of the second caliph Umar, that the Muslims captured Qom&#x27;s center. In 644-645 CE, Abu Moosa Ashari, dispatched forces under his command to Qom. Conflicts arose between the invading Arabs and the residents of the area.

During the persecution of the Alavids by the Abbasids and Umayyads, many Alavids fled to Qom, making it their permanent home. The Caliph Al-Ma&#x27;mun sent forces to Qom in the year 825 CE, resulting in a public massacre and destruction of the city.

On hearing of the demise of al-Ma&#x27;mun, the inhabitants of Qom revolted and were successful in overthrowing the representative of the Caliph in 831 CE. However, al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s successor, al-Mu&#x27;tasim, dispatched forces to Qom in order to curb the riots and once again the city was set aflame. The unrest continued until the Buwayhid dynasty (&quot;Al e Booyeh&quot; in Persian) came to power, being of the Alavid community. It was during this reign that the city of Qom expanded and thrived.

In the Saljuqi era the city flourished once more. During the first wave of the Mongol invasion, the city witnessed destruction, but after Mongol rulers, particularly after Sultan Öljeitü Khoda bandeh of the Ilkhanate dynasty converted to Islam, the city received special attention, thus witnessing a revival once again.

In the late 14th century, the city came under the plunder of Tamerlane when the inhabitants were massacred again. During the periods of the rule of the &quot;Qarah Qoyoonloo&quot;, &quot;Aq Qoyoonloo&quot;, and especially during the reign of the Safavids, Qom gained special attention and gradually developed.

By 1503, Qom became one of the important centers of theology in relation to the Shia Islam and became a vital pilgrimage site and religious pivot.

During the Afghan invasion, the city of Qom suffered heavy damages, and its inhabitants witnessed severe economic hardships. Qom further sustained damages during the reigns of Nader Shah, and the conflicts between the two households of Zandieh and Qajar in order to gain power in Iran.

In 1798, Qom came under the control of Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar. On being victorious over his enemies, Fath Ali Shah made repairs to the sepulcher and shrine of Ma&#x27;soumeh, fulfilling his vow.

The city of Qom thrived in the Qajar era. After Russian forces entered Karaj in 1915, many of the inhabitants of Tehran moved to Qom. The transfer of the capital from Tehran to Qom was discussed, but the British and Russians demolished the plan by bringing the monarch of the times, Ahmad Shah Qajar under pressure. Coinciding with this period, a &#x27;National Defense Committee&#x27; was set up, and Qom turned into a political and military apex against the Russian and British colonial powers. Qom was also the center from which Ayatollah Khomeini based his opposition to the Pahlavi dynasty, while in Iran.

==Geography==
The climate of Qom Province varies between a desert and semi-desert climate and comprises mountainous areas, foothills, and plains. Due to being located near an arid region and far inland, it experiences a dry climate, with low humidity and scanty rainfall. Thus, agriculture is not possible in most of its areas, especially near the salt lake regions. Qom province has two large salt lakes, namely: Howz e Soltan Lake, which lies 36 km due north of Qom, and Namak Lake which lies 80 km due east of Qom. Nearly a fifth of Namak Lake lies within Qom Province.

=== City of Qom ===

Today, Qom is considered one of the focal centers of the Shiah branch of Islam. Its theological center and the shrine of Ma&#x27;soomeh are prominent features of the provincial capital of Qom. Outside the city is Jamkaran, another site of religious pilgrimages.

Qom has at times again been considered as a possible candidate for moving the political capital of Iran, as Tehran faces an increasing probability of an overdue major earthquake and is notorious for its pollution and traffic congestion. The conservative factions are favorable to this idea while the business and economic base of Tehran opposes any such moves.

In 2009 it was disclosed that a mountain range near Qom is the site of Iran&#x27;s second uranium enrichment facility, containing 3000 gas centrifuges.

== Politics ==

Qom Province is a politically conservative region.

<doc id="448092" wikidata="Q168949" url="?curid=448092" title="Semnan province">
<text>Semnan province () is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. It is in the north of the country. Its capital is the city of Semnan.

The province of Semnan covers an area of 96,816 square kilometers and stretches along the Alborz mountain range, bordering on Kavir desert in its southern parts. The province was made part of Region 1 on 22 June 2014, as the provinces were grouped into 5 regions for coordination and development purposes.

==History==

In the Median and Achaemenid times, Semnan was one of the largest provinces of the empires, and corresponded to the borders of the ancient region of Parthia.

During the Islamic era, Semnan was part of the historical region of &quot;Gomess&quot; or &quot;Komesh&quot;.

==Demographics==
===Language and ethnicity===
Various ethnic groups with Kurdish, Turkish, Lor, Arab, Baloch and Gilak origins are settled in this province and it is also known as the Island of the Tribes due to the variety of ethnic groups living in the province.

The Semnani languages (known also as Komisenian languages) spoken in the province are a group of Northwestern Iranian languages, (only 68,700 native speakers in 2019) of Iran. These languages are accorded only &quot;dialect&quot; status in some sources. Most of the Semnani languages are descendants of the extinct Parthian while Semnani proper has been placed among the Caspian languages descended from the extinct Median.

There are six Semnani languages named in the literature, these being Semnani, Biyabunaki, Sangsari, Sorkhei, Aftari and Lasgerdi – of which some may only be dialects, although there has been little published concerning the relationships between them.

Semnani proper (Semnani: سمنی زفون), like other Caspian languages, bears some resemblance to the Old Iranian Median language but was influenced by Parthian in a later process.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the province&#x27;s population was 570,835 in 159,791 households. The following census in 2011 counted 631,218 people in 186,114 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the province as 702,360 in 215,571 households.

Semnan province is located on the southern slopes of the Alborz mountain range. The height of the province decreases from north to south until it reaches the desert. The area of this province is 96000 square kilometers and it is 5.6% of the area of Iran.

===Administrative divisions===
The population history and structural changes of Semnan province&#x27;s administrative divisions over three consecutive censuses are shown in the following table.

=== Cities ===
According to the 2016 census, 560,502 people (nearly 80% of the population of Semnan province) live in the following cities:

==Geography==

The province is divided into two parts: a mountainous region and the plains at the foot of the mountains. The former offers scope for recreational activities as well as being a source for minerals, while the latter encompasses some ancient cities of Iran, including one of the capitals of the ancient Parthian Empire.

The province neighbors Golestan and Mazandaran Provinces to the north, North Khorasan province to the northeast, Tehran and Qom Provinces to the west, Isfahan province to the south, South Khorasan province to the southeast, and Razavi Khorasan province to the east.

===Abr forest===

This forest lies in Semnan province near its border with Golestan province. It is one of the oldest forests in Iran and a remnant of the third geological age. The Iranian Roads Ministry&#x27;s decision to build a road through the forest sparked widespread protests last year.

The environmentalists, backed by the country&#x27;s media, began a wide campaign against the ministry&#x27;s decision, which finally led the Prosecutor General to order a halt in the construction of the road. However, all these efforts came to naught when it was announced in April 2008 that the government granted permission to the Roads Ministry to construct the road.

<text>Fanny Efimovna Kaplan (; real name Feiga Haimovna Roytblat; ; February 10, 1890 – September 3, 1918) was a Russian Socialist-Revolutionary who attempted to assassinate Vladimir Lenin. She was arrested and executed by the Cheka in 1918.

Born into a Jewish family, Kaplan served a sentence of hard labor during the tsarist years for her revolutionary activities. As a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, Kaplan viewed Lenin as a &quot;traitor to the revolution&quot; when the Bolsheviks enacted one-party rule and banned her party. On August 30, 1918, she approached Lenin, who was leaving a Moscow factory, and fired three shots, which badly injured him. Interrogated by the Cheka, she refused to name any accomplices and was executed. The Kaplan attempt and the Moisei Uritsky assassination were used by the government of Soviet Russia for the reinstatement of capital punishment, which had been abolished by the Russian Provisional Government in March 1917.

==Early life==
Relatively little is known for certain about Kaplan&#x27;s background. She was born into a Jewish family. Her father was a teacher, and she had seven siblings. There has been confusion about her full name. Vera Figner (in her memoirs, &quot;At Women&#x27;s Katorga&quot;), stated that Kaplan&#x27;s original name was Feiga Khaimovna Roytblat-Kaplan (Фейга Хаимовна Ройтблат-Каплан). However, other sources have stated that her original family name was Roytman (Ройтман), corresponding to the common German and Yiddish surname Reutemann (). She was also sometimes known by the given name Dora.

Kaplan was home educated and soon left home to work as a milliner in Odessa. She became a political revolutionary at an early age and joined a socialist group, the Socialist Revolutionaries (SRs). In 1906, when she was 16 years old, Kaplan was arrested in Kiev over her involvement in a terrorist bomb plot to blow up the city&#x27;s governor, Vladimir Sukhomlinov. She was captured after a bomb she and her romantic partner were working on accidentally exploded. She was committed for life to the katorga, a hard labour prison camp. She served in the Maltsev and Akatuy prisons of Nerchinsk katorga, Siberia, where she lost her sight, which was partially restored later. She was released on March 3, 1917, after the February Revolution overthrew the imperial government. As a result of her imprisonment, Kaplan suffered from continuous headaches and periods of blindness.

Kaplan became disillusioned with Lenin in 1917–1918, due to conflict between the SRs and the Bolsheviks. The latter had strong support in the soviets, but in the November 1917 elections to the Constituent Assembly, non-Bolsheviks were the majority. When the Assembly met in January 1918, a Socialist Revolutionary was elected president. The Bolsheviks responded by dissolving the Constituent Assembly. By August 1918, the Bolsheviks had banned most other parties. Most recently, they had banned the Left Socialist Revolutionaries (Left SRs), formerly the Bolsheviks&#x27; main coalition partners, who had rebelled against them in July in opposition to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Kaplan decided to assassinate Lenin because she considered him &quot;a traitor to the Revolution&quot;.

==Assassination attempt==

On August 30, 1918, Lenin spoke at the Hammer and Sickle, an arms factory in southern Moscow. As Lenin left the building and before he had entered his car, Kaplan called out to him. When Lenin turned towards her, she fired three shots with a FN M1900 pistol. One bullet passed through Lenin&#x27;s coat, and the other two struck him. One passed through his neck, punctured part of his left lung, and stopped near his right collarbone; the other lodged in his left shoulder.

Lenin was taken back to his living quarters at the Kremlin. He feared that others might be planning to kill him and refused to leave the security of the Kremlin to seek medical attention. Doctors were brought in to treat him but could not remove the bullets outside a hospital. Despite the severity of his injuries, Lenin survived, but his health never fully recovered from the attack. It has been speculated that the shooting contributed to the strokes that incapacitated and eventually killed him in 1924.

==Capture and execution==
There are contradictory stories of her capture. According to the testimony of Deputy Commissar S. N. Batulin, he was within 20 steps of Lenin when he heard three shots and saw Lenin face down on the ground. Afterwards, he identified a woman who he felt looked suspicious and detained her. That turned out to be Kaplan. However, the factory commissar N. I. Ivanov claimed to have arrested her after she had been identified by several children, who had followed her down the street. During interrogation by the Cheka, she made the following statement:

Kaplan referenced the Bolsheviks&#x27; growing authoritarianism, citing their forcible shutdown of the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, the elections to which they had lost. When it became clear that Kaplan would not implicate any accomplices, she was executed in Alexander Garden. The order was carried out by the commander of the Kremlin, the former Baltic sailor P. D. Malkov and a group of Latvian Bolsheviks on September 3, 1918, with a bullet to the back of the head. Her corpse was bundled into a barrel and set alight. The order came from Yakov Sverdlov, who only six weeks earlier had ordered the murder of the Tsar and his family.

===Guilt===

Grigory Semyonov, a military commander in the SR who later turned state&#x27;s evidence against the group, testified in 1922 that Kaplan had been a member of his organization and that he regarded her as the &quot;best person to carry out the attack on Lenin&quot;.

Some historians such as Dmitri Volkogonov, Arkady Vaksberg and Donald Rayfield have questioned the actual role of Kaplan in the assassination attempt. Volkogonov suggested that &quot;it is more likely&quot; that Kaplan was actually not the culprit and described her assassination attempt as &quot;another of the many mystifications of Bolshevik history&quot;. Vaksberg stated that Lidia Konopleva, another SR, was the culprit and believed that it would be all too comforting that Lenin narrowly avoided being assassinated by a woman whose personality is so far from the stereotype of a national hero. In particular, it had been suggested that she was working on behalf of others and, after her arrest, assumed sole responsibility. The main arguments put forth in that and other versions is that she was nearly blind, and none of the witnesses actually saw her fire the gun. Another argument points to the contradiction between the official Soviet account and official documents, particularly a radiogram by Yakov Peters that mentions the arrest of several suspects, instead of only one. Furthermore, the bullet removed from Lenin&#x27;s neck after his death was found to have been fired from a weapon other than the one that Kaplan had. Semion Lyandres went so far as to argue that Kaplan was not even an SR.

==Legacy==

Despite her refusal to name accomplices, the official announcement of the assassination attempt had Sverdlov blame the Right SRs although it denied any involvement. Moisei Uritsky, the People&#x27;s Commissar for Internal Affairs in the Northern Region and the head of the Cheka in Petrograd, had been assassinated nearly two weeks prior to the attack on Lenin. The Cheka did not find any evidence linking both events, but their occurrence in quick succession appeared significant in the context of the intensifying civil war. The Bolsheviks&#x27; reaction was an abrupt escalation in the persecution of their opponents.

An official decree announcing the Red Terror was issued only hours after the Kaplan shooting and called for an &quot;all-out struggle against enemies of the revolution&quot;. In the next few months, about 800 Right SRs and other political opponents of Bolsheviks were executed. During the first year, the scope of the Red Terror expanded significantly.

== In fiction ==

In the 1939 Soviet film &quot;Lenin in 1918&quot; directed by Mikhail Romm, Natalia Efron portrays Kaplan. In the 1934 Hollywood film &quot;British Agent&quot; directed by Michael Curtiz, Corinne Williams and Zozia Tanina portray Kaplan. In the West German TV series &quot;&quot; (1967), Peggy Parnas portrays Franja Kaplan. In the 1983 British TV series &quot;Reilly, Ace of Spies&quot;, Sara Clee portrays Kaplan. The life of Fanny Kaplan has also been portrayed in a Ukrainian film &quot;My Grandmother Fanny Kaplan&quot; (2016) directed by Olena Demyanenko.

Kaplan has been the subject of or character in several plays (including &quot;Fanny Kaplan&quot; by Venedikt Yerofeyev; &quot;Kill me, o my beloved!&quot; by Elena Isaeva; &quot;The Bolsheviks&quot; by Mikhail Shatrov) and books (&quot;Europe Central&quot; by William T. Vollmann). Pamela Adlon&#x27;s character in &quot;History of the World, Part II&quot;, Fanny Mudman, is loosely based on Kaplan, most notably when she attempts to kill Lenin.

<text>Sistan and Baluchestan province () is the second largest of the 31 Provinces of Iran, after Kerman Province, with an area of 180,726 km2. Its capital is the city of Zahedan. The province is in the southeast of the country, bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The name of the region was Baluchistan at first. Later it became «Baluchistan and Sistan», and today it has become «Sistan and Baluchestan».

==History==

In the inscriptions at Behistun and Persepolis, Sistan is mentioned as one of the eastern territories of Darius the Great. The name Sistan, as mentioned above, is derived from Saka (also sometimes &quot;Saga&quot;, or &quot;Sagastan&quot;), a Central Asian tribe that had taken control over this area in the year 128 BC. During the Arsacid dynasty (248 BC to 224 AD), the province became the seat of Suren-Pahlav Clan. From the Sassanid period until the early Islamic period, Sistan flourished considerably.

During the reign of Ardashir I of Persia, Sistan came under the jurisdiction of the Sassanids, and in 644 AD, the Arab Muslims gained control as the Persian empire was in its final moments of collapsing.

During the reign of the second Sunni caliph, Omar ibn Al-Khattab, this territory was conquered by the Arabs and an Arab commander was assigned as governor. The famous Persian ruler Ya&#x27;qub-i Laith Saffari, whose descendants dominated this area for many centuries, later became governor of this province. In 916 AD, Baluchestan was ruled by the Daylamids and thereafter the Seljuqids, when it became a part of Kerman. Dynasties such as the Saffarids, Samanids, Qaznavids, and Seljuqids, also ruled over this territory.

In 1508 AD, Shah Ismail I of the Safavid dynasty conquered Sistan. After the assassination of Nader Shah in 1747, Sistan and Balochistan became part of the Brahui Khanate of Kalat, which ruled it till 1896. Afterwards, it became part of Qajar Iran.

== Water ==
Iran ranks among the most water stressed countries in the world. Sistan-Baluchestan province suffers from major water problems that were aggravated by corruption in Iran&#x27;s water supply sector, lack of transparency, neglect of marginalized communities, and political favoritism. The IRGC and other politically connected entities control water resources, prioritizing projects for political and economic gain rather than public need. They divert supplies to favored regions, causing shortages in vulnerable provinces like Khuzestan and Sistan-Baluchestan. For example, water diversion projects in Isfahan and Yazd provinces receive priority despite critical shortages in Khuzestan and Sistan-Baluchestan. Reports also indicate that certain agricultural and industrial enterprises with ties to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) have received significant amounts of water, while small farmers and rural communities struggle with severe shortages.

Iran&#x27;s central government prioritizes water allocation for industrial and urban centers, often at the expense of rural and minority populations. These groups face severe water shortages, ecological degradation, and a loss of livelihoods. This pattern of unequal development not only exacerbates regional disparities but also fuels social unrest and environmental crises. Iran&#x27;s water policy is also characterized by an overreliance on dam construction and large-scale diversion projects, primarily benefiting politically connected enterprises and urban elites. This has led to the drying of rivers, wetlands, and other vital ecosystems, intensifying dust storms and land subsidence in regions like Khuzestan and Sistan-Baluchestan. Such environmental degradation, combined with insufficient governmental oversight and transparency, worsens living conditions for marginalized communities, reinforcing cycles of poverty and socio-political marginalization.

<text>Isaac Ingalls Stevens (March 25, 1818 – September 1, 1862) was an American military officer and politician who served as governor of the Territory of Washington from 1853 to 1857, and later as its delegate to the United States House of Representatives. During the American Civil War, he held several commands in the Union Army. He was killed at the Battle of Chantilly, while at the head of his men and carrying the fallen colors of one of his regiments against Confederate positions. According to one account, at the hour of his death Stevens was being considered by President Abraham Lincoln for appointment to command the Army of Virginia. He was posthumously advanced to the rank of Major General. Several schools, towns, counties, and lakes are named in his honor.

Descended from early American settlers in New England, Stevens – a man who stood just tall – overcame a troubled childhood and personal setbacks to graduate at the top of his class at West Point before embarking on a successful military career. He was a controversial and polarizing figure as governor of the Washington Territory, where he was both praised and condemned. He was described by one historian as the subject of more reflection and study than almost the rest of the territory&#x27;s 19th-century history combined. Stevens&#x27; marathon diplomacy with Native American tribes sought to avoid military conflict in Washington; however, when the Yakama War broke out as Native Americans resisted European encroachment, he prosecuted it mercilessly. His decision to rule by martial law, jail judges who opposed him, and raise a &quot;de facto&quot; personal army led to his conviction for contempt of court, for which he famously pardoned himself, and a rebuke from the President of the United States. Nonetheless, his uncompromising decisiveness in the face of crisis was both applauded by his supporters and noted by historians.

Isaac Stevens was the father of Hazard Stevens, the hero of the Battle of Suffolk and one of the first men to summit Mount Rainier.

==Early life and education==
Stevens was born in North Andover, Massachusetts, to Isaac Stevens and Hannah Stevens (née Cummings), a descendant of early Puritan settlers from a gentry family that had produced several distinguished members of the clergy and military. He was a cousin of brothers Moses Tyler Stevens and Charles Abbot Stevens. As a young man, he was noted for his intelligence, particularly his mathematical acuity. His diminutive stature – in adulthood he stood tall – has been attributed to a possible congenital gland malfunction.

Stevens resented his father, described by historian Kent Richards as a &quot;stern taskmaster&quot;, whose unrelenting demands on his son pushed the young man to his breaking point. While working on the family farm, Stevens once nearly died of sunstroke. After Stevens&#x27; mother died in a carriage accident, his widowed father married a woman whom Stevens disliked. According to Stevens, he came close to suffering a mental breakdown in his youth.

Stevens graduated from the male prep school Phillips Academy in 1833 and was accepted to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He graduated in 1839 at the top of his class.

==Career==
Stevens was the adjutant of the Corps of Engineers during the Mexican–American War, seeing action at the siege of Vera Cruz and at Cerro Gordo, Contreras, and Churubusco. In the latter fight, he caught the attention of his superiors, who rewarded him with the brevet rank of captain. He was again cited and breveted for gallantry at the Battle of Chapultepec, this time to the rank of major. Stevens participated in combat at Molino del Rey, and the Battle for Mexico City, where he was severely wounded. He later wrote a book on his adventures, &quot;Campaigns of the Rio Grande and Mexico, with Notices of the Recent Work of Major Ripley&quot; (New York, 1851).

He superintended fortifications on the New England coast from 1841 until 1849. He was given command of the U.S. Coast Survey office in Washington, D.C., working closely with the Survey&#x27;s superintendent Alexander D. Bache. Stevens served in that role until March 1853.

===Governor of Washington (1853–1857)===

Stevens was a firm supporter of former brigadier general Franklin Pierce&#x27;s candidacy for President of the United States in 1852, as both men had served in the Mexican–American War. Stevens was rewarded by President Pierce on March 17, 1853 by being named governor of the newly created Washington Territory. (The position also included the title of Superintendent of Indian Affairs for that region). Stevens chose to add one more duty as he traveled west to the territory he would govern: the government was calling for a surveyor to map an appropriate railroad route across the northern United States, hoping that a transcontinental railroad would open up Asian markets. With Stevens&#x27; engineering experience (and likely the favor of Pierce yet again, as well as Secretary of War Jefferson Davis), he won the bid. His party, which included George Suckley, John Mullan and Fred Burr, son of David H. Burr, spent most of 1853 moving slowly across the prairie, surveying the way to Washington Territory. There Stevens met George McClellan&#x27;s party, which had surveyed the line between the Puget Sound and the Spokane River. He took up his post at Olympia as governor in November that year.

As a result of his expedition, Stevens wrote a third book, &quot;Report of Explorations for a Route for the Pacific Railroad near the 47th and 49th Parallels of North Latitude, from St. Paul, Minnesota, to Puget Sound&quot;, (commissioned and published by the United States Congress) (2 vols., Washington, 1855–1860).

Stevens was a controversial governor in his time. Historians consider him even more controversial, for his role in compelling the Native American tribes of Washington Territory by intimidation and force, into signing treaties that ceded most of their lands and rights to Stevens&#x27; government, likely forging some of the signatures. These included the Treaty of Medicine Creek, Treaty of Hellgate, Treaty of Neah Bay, Treaty of Point Elliott, Point No Point Treaty, and Quinault Treaty. During this time, the Governor imposed martial law to better impose his will on the Indians and whites who opposed his views. The consequent political and legal battles would soon overshadow the Indian war.

Stevens did not hesitate to use his troops for vengeance, and waged a brutal winter campaign against the Yakama tribe, led by Chief Kamiakin. This, along with his unjustified execution of the Nisqually chieftain Leschi, led to widespread pleas to President Pierce to remove Stevens from his post. Two men were particularly vocal in their opposition to Stevens and his policies, territorial judge Edward Lander and influential private citizen Ezra Meeker. While Meeker was ignored, Lander was arrested by Stevens&#x27; forces due to his opposition. Pierce refused to remove Stevens from his position, but eventually sent word to the governor expressing his disapproval. Any opposition eventually died down, as most white settlers in Washington Territory felt that Stevens was on &quot;their side&quot;, while they considered Meeker to be too sympathetic to Native Americans.

As a result of this public perception, Stevens was popular enough to be elected as the territory&#x27;s delegate to the United States Congress in 1857 and 1858. The tensions between whites and Native Americans would be left for others to resolve. Stevens is often charged with responsibility for the later conflicts in eastern Washington and Idaho, especially the war fought by the United States against Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce, These events were decades in the future when Stevens left Washington State for good in 1857.

===Martial law===
In January 1856, Governor Stevens declared to the territorial House of Representatives in Olympia that &quot;war shall be prosecuted until the last hostile Indian is exterminated&quot;, although there is uncertainty among historians about whether this was a call for genocide or instead for war crimes against certain &quot;hostile Indians&quot;.

In April 1856, Governor Stevens removed settlers whom he believed to be aiding the enemy (in many cases because they had married into local tribes) and placing them in the military&#x27;s custody. Governor Stevens declared martial law in Pierce County in order to conduct a military trial of those settlers. He next declared martial law in Thurston County. But only the territorial legislature had the authority to declare martial law, and representatives fought Stevens&#x27; effort to abrogate their authority. A bitter political and legal battle ensued.

Stevens was forced to repeal the declaration and fight subsequent calls for his removal. His decision to use martial law was the result of his determination to enforce a blockhouse policy in the war against the Indians of the Puget Sound region. Indian raids on scattered settlements and an intimidating attack on the city of Seattle in February 1856 resulted in Governor Stevens concluding that he needed to concentrate on defensive measures, given the limited number of men at his disposal. He determined that the white population should be concentrated at specific strongly protected points. For that reason, the volunteers under Stevens&#x27; command built a series of forts and blockhouses along the Snoqualmie, White, and Nisqually rivers. Once completed, Stevens ordered the settler population to leave their claims and take temporary residence in these safer areas.

Once Stevens proclaimed martial law, he raised a new and more significant issue. Stevens&#x27; proclamation of martial law in Pierce County stated:

On May 11, 1856, attorneys George Gibbs and H. A. Goldsborough sent a letter to the Secretary of State denying that the war situation throughout the territory, and especially in Pierce County, was as grave as Governor Stevens had declared at the time of proclaiming martial law. They said that Stevens&#x27; allegations made against Charles Wren, John McLeod, John McField, Lyon A. Smith, and Henry Smith, were based wholly on suspicion. They asserted that the only factual related evidence was that on Christmas Day, a party of Indians had visited McLeod&#x27;s cabin and had forced him to give them food. Gibbs and Goldsborough declared that:

The territorial organic act designated the governor as &quot;commander-in-chief of the militia thereof,&quot; but there were not a regularly constituted militia. Stevens assumed his powers from his control of local volunteer troops, which had been organized to meet the necessities of the situation. These had not been authorized either by the federal government or by the territorial legislature. Stevens&#x27; position as Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the territory had a broad administrative responsibility but possessed no direct military power. On May 24, 1856, following a legal opinion rendered by Judge Chenoweth, ruling that Stevens had no legal power to declare martial law, Governor Stevens rescinded his proclamation in Pierce and Thurston counties.

===Civil War===
After the Civil War began in 1861, and following the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run, Stevens was commissioned in the army again. He was appointed as colonel of the 79th New York Volunteers, known as the &quot;Cameron Highlanders.&quot; He was promoted to a brigadier general on September 28, 1861, and fought at Port Royal. He led the Second Brigade of the Expeditionary Forces sent to attack the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina. He led a division at the Battle of Secessionville, where he led an attack on Fort Lamar, in which 25% of his men were casualties.

Stevens was transferred with his IX Corps division to Virginia to serve under Major General John Pope in the Northern Virginia Campaign and the Second Battle of Bull Run. He was killed in action at the Battle of Chantilly on September 1, 1862, after picking up the fallen regimental colors of his old regiment, shouting &quot;Highlanders, my Highlanders, follow your general!&quot; Charging with his troops while carrying the banner of Saint Andrew&#x27;s Cross, Stevens was struck in the temple by a bullet and died instantly.

He was buried in Newport, Rhode Island, at Island Cemetery. In March 1863, he was posthumously promoted to major general, backdated to July 18, 1862.

Stevens had married. His son, Hazard Stevens, had become a career officer and was also injured in the Battle of Chantilly. He survived and eventually became a general in the U.S. Army and an author. Together with P. B. Van Trump, he participated in the first documented ascent of Mount Rainier in Washington State.

==Death on battlefield==

A combination of an increasingly violent thunderstorm and unrelenting Confederate fire had slowed the advance of the 79th New York Regiment to a crawl. Five successive regimental color bearers had died leading the line. When Stevens saw that yet another soldier who was carrying the regimental flag had been shot, he raced from his position in the rear, through the panicked body of his men, to wrench the flag from the wounded man&#x27;s grasp. According to witnesses, the injured color bearer - knowing the regimental flag would be a target - yelled at Stevens &quot;for God&#x27;s sake, General, don&#x27;t take the colors!&quot;

Stevens ignored the man&#x27;s appeal and seized the colors, at which point his own son, Hazard, who was serving in the regiment, was shot and injured by a Confederate volley. Hazard Stevens cried out to his father for help, to which the general replied, &quot;I can&#x27;t attend to you now, Hazard. Corporal Thompson, see to my boy&quot;. Stevens turned to his men and yelled, &quot;Follow your General!&quot; Facing the Confederate line and waving the recovered regimental colors, Stevens proceeded to charge the Confederate positions, his men following in close order. The renewed advance forced the defending Louisianans to fall back into the woods.

Stevens led his men over the abandoned Confederate ramparts, pursuing the retreating Confederate forces into the forest. At that moment, a Confederate bullet struck Stevens in the head, killing him instantly. As he collapsed, his body twisted, wrapping itself in the flag that he was still carrying and staining it with his blood. According to a period newspaper report, Stevens&#x27; body was recovered an hour after his death, his hands still clenched around the staff of the flag.

He was buried in Island Cemetery in Newport, Rhode Island.

==Legacy==
===Reputation===
Historians have generally viewed Stevens as a complicated figure. According to historian David Nicandri, the four years in which he ruled Washington &quot;takes up a greater volume of concern and consciousness than the entire balance of the territorial officialdom up until the time Washington becomes a state in 1889&quot;. Accounts of Stevens&#x27; tenure have been highly polarized. Writing in 1972, Richards observed that nearly all accounts of his tenure have either &quot;condemned&quot; or &quot;uncritically applauded&quot; him. Ezra Meeker, a historian, settler, and contemporary opponent of Stevens, described him as one who would &quot;take no counsel, nor brook opposition to his will&quot;.

===Posthumous promotion===
In March 1863, at the request of President Abraham Lincoln, the United States Senate posthumously advanced Stevens to the rank of Major General. According to George Cullum&#x27;s &quot;Biographical Register of the Officers and Graduates of the United States Military Academy&quot; &quot;at the very hour of his death, the President and Secretary of War were considering the advisability of placing Stevens in command of the Army in which he was serving&quot;.

===Memorials===
A marker at Ox Hill Battlefield Park, site of the Battle of Chantilly, commemorates the approximate place where Stevens fell while leading his men.

In Washington, Stevens County is named in his honor, as is Lake Stevens. Several Washington public schools, including Seattle&#x27;s Isaac I. Stevens Elementary School, Port Angeles&#x27; Stevens Middle School, and Pasco&#x27;s Isaac Stevens Middle School, are also named in his honor, as is the Washington State University dormitory Stevens Hall. The Washington chapter of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War is known as Isaac Stevens Camp No. 1.

In addition, Stevensville, Montana, Stevens County, Minnesota, and Idaho&#x27;s Stevens Peak, Upper Stevens Lake, and Lower Stevens Lake are named in tribute to Stevens.

The United States Army previously maintained two military posts named after Stevens: Fort Stevens in Washington, D.C., and Fort Stevens in Oregon.

===Biographies===
Hazard Stevens wrote a biography of his father, &quot;The Life of Isaac Ingalls Stevens&quot; (1900). Kent Richards&#x27; biography, &quot;Isaac I. Stevens: Young Man in a Hurry&quot; (1979), remains in print as of 2016.

===Hall of fame===
In 1962, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

<text>Zanjan province () is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. Its capital is the city of Zanjan. It is a mountainous province with close to 22,000 km2 of land placed in Iran&#x27;s Region 3. Two-thirds of the people of the province live in the cities, mainly the capital and Abhar.

== History ==
In Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;, the city is referred to as Aganzana. It is said that the Sassanid king Ardashir I of Persia reconstructed the city and called it Shahin. Later it was renamed Zangan, whose present name is the Arabicized form. In past times Zanjan&#x27;s name was Khamseh, which means &quot;province with five tribes.&quot; Zanjan province incorporates areas of the former Gerrus province.

=== Former names ===
At least since the era of the Zand dynasty, Zanjan and its surrounding areas were called Khamseh. In a book named &quot;Mojmal al-Tawarikh-e Golestaneh&quot;, while discussing the events of the Karim Khan Zand era, it mentions the Mahal-e Khamseh (literally, &quot;Khamseh areas&quot;) in reference to the regions of Zanjan province. The use of Khamseh for Zanjan could precede the Zand era, since after the death of Nader Shah and the collapse of the great unification of the Afshar tribes, the tribe of Afshar-e Khamseh returned to the Mahal-e Khamseh. The tribe&#x27;s name, therefore, had already contained the suffix of &quot;Khamseh&quot; since the era of Nader Shah, and possibly before they had left the Zanjan area to accompany Nader. It can be concluded that at least since the time of Nader and the Afsharids, the area was called Khamseh.

It has been said that when Karim Khan Zand left Ardabil and Khalkhal to suppress Zaki Khan in Kashan, he entered Zanjan, and in Abhar he delegated the governorship of three areas of Mahal-e Khamseh to Zolfagharkhan-e Sultan Irluy-e Afshar. This is another indication of the area&#x27;s having been named Khamseh at the time of Zands.

During the following time of the Qajars, Zanjan province was also known as Khamseh. In the book &quot;Esker-ol-Tavarikh&quot;, Etemad Al-Saltaneh discusses Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar just before the formation of the Qajar dynasty, using the title of &quot;Hakem-e Khamseh&quot; (Governor of Khamseh). In addition, Mirza Abolhasan Khan Shirazi in his travelogue in the year 1229 Hijri (around 1814) mentions Khamseh. Among European travellers, the first person who used the name Khamseh for the province where Zanjan was located was Pierre Amédée Jaubert, sent by Napoleon Bonaparte to visit Fath Ali Shah&#x27;s court, and in the year 1804 visited Zanjan city.

==Demographics==

<text>The Carol Burnett Show is an American variety/sketch comedy television show that originally ran on CBS from September 11, 1967, to March 29, 1978, for 279 episodes, and again with nine episodes in fall 1991. It starred Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman, Vicki Lawrence, and Lyle Waggoner. In 1975, frequent guest star Tim Conway became a regular cast member after Waggoner left the series. In 1977, Dick Van Dyke replaced Korman, but it was agreed that he was not a match and he left after 10 episodes.

The series originated in CBS Television City&#x27;s Studio 33, and won 25 primetime Emmy Awards. In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; number 17 on its list of the 60 Greatest Shows of All Time, and in 2007 it was included on the list of &quot;Time&quot;″s 100 Best TV Shows of All Time. In 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; #23 on its own list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.

After the original run ended, material from 1972 to 1977 (seasons 6–10) was repackaged as a half-hour series known as Carol Burnett and Friends, which has aired in various syndicated outlets more-or-less continuously since the original series ended. Because of this format, material from the first five seasons did not air, outside of their original run, until 2019 when MeTV acquired the rights to these earlier seasons and began airing them. The cast has periodically reunited for various one-off specials and short appearances, and several members of the cast went on to star in &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; (1983–1990), a half-hour situation comedy based on &quot;The Family&quot; sketch series from &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;.

==Background==
By 1967, Carol Burnett had been a popular veteran of television for 12 years, having made her first appearances in 1955 on &quot;The Paul Winchell Show&quot; and the sitcom &quot;Stanley&quot; starring the comedian Buddy Hackett. In 1959, she became a regular supporting cast member on the CBS-TV variety series &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;. Departing the series in the spring of 1962, she pursued other projects in film, Broadway productions, and headlining her own television specials. Burnett signed a contract with CBS for 10 years which required her to do two guest appearances and a special a year. Within the first five years of this contract, she had the option to &quot;push the button&quot;, a phrase the programming executives used, and be put on the air in 30 one-hour, pay-or-play variety shows.

After discussion with her husband Joe Hamilton, in the last week of the fifth year of the contract, Burnett decided to call the head of CBS Michael Dann and exercise the clause. Dann, explaining that variety is a &quot;man&#x27;s genre&quot;, offered Burnett a sitcom called &quot;Here&#x27;s Agnes&quot;. Burnett had no interest in doing a sitcom, and because of the contract, CBS was obliged to give Burnett her own variety show.

The popular and long-running variety show not only established Burnett as a television superstar, but it also made her regular supporting cast household names. It was nominated for 70 Emmys and won 25 times.

==Production==
===Cast===

In addition to Carol Burnett, the cast consisted of:
*Vicki Lawrence
*Harvey Korman (seasons 1–10)
*Lyle Waggoner (seasons 1–7)
*Tim Conway (seasons 9–11; frequent guest performer in seasons 1–8)
*Dick Van Dyke (first half of season 11)
Comedic actor Harvey Korman had done many guest shots in TV sitcoms. From 1963 to 1967, he had been a semi-regular on the CBS variety series &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot;. Burnett already had become an admirer of Korman&#x27;s talent as a sketch comedian on that series. When Kaye&#x27;s program ended in the spring of 1967, Burnett insisted that he be signed for her series and Korman immediately joined &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; as a regular.

Actor Lyle Waggoner had recently auditioned for the title role in the ABC series &quot;Batman&quot; but was passed over in favor of Adam West. Shortly after, Waggoner auditioned for the Burnett show and was immediately hired. He would often play a handsome man for Burnett to fawn over. His participation on the series was somewhat modeled on Durward Kirby of &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;, as Waggoner was also the show&#x27;s announcer in addition to playing in sketches.
Vicki Lawrence, a young singer from The Young Americans, wrote a letter to Burnett when she was 17, remarking on their physical resemblance. This led to her audition and getting hired to play Burnett&#x27;s kid sister in numerous &quot;Carol and Sis&quot; sketches.

===Costumes===
Bob Mackie created all of the costumes, including evening gowns, character outfits and dance clothing for guests during the run of the show, including the iconic curtain dress from the &quot;Went with the Wind!&quot; sketch, which is now housed in the Smithsonian Institution. Burnett credited him with coming up with comedic touches for various characters, such as the tight-legged skirt for Mr. Tudball&#x27;s secretary, Mrs. Wiggins. She told Mackie the skirt was too baggy in the back for her physique, but he told her to stick her bottom out to fill it, resulting in the character&#x27;s distinctive posture and walk. In a 2003 interview with Terry Gross, she said Mackie would put rice in the “older woman” undergarments, where typically cotton would’ve been used, to make the saggy breasts have weight and movement as the characters walked or danced, such as when Burnett portrayed Norma Desmond or Charo&#x27;s mother. Burnett estimated that Mackie had created 17,000 outfits for the show, and said his costume work added more humor to some of the skits Burnett felt were weaker than others.

===Guests===
Jim Nabors was the guest star on every season premiere of the show. Burnett considered Nabors to be her annual good luck charm.

Celebrity guests who appeared on a semi-regular basis included Steve Lawrence (29 appearances), Ken Berry (20 appearances), Eydie Gorme, Nanette Fabray (13 appearances), Bernadette Peters and Mel Torme (10 appearances).

Other notable guests include Olivia De Havilland, Lucille Ball, Joanne Woodward, Rita Hayworth, Dinah Shore, Rock Hudson, Cher, Martha Raye, Maggie Smith, Don Rickles, George Carlin, Gloria Swanson, Ella Fitzgerald, Joan Rivers, Rita Moreno, Tony Randall, Betty White, Phyllis Diller, Eddie Albert, Carol Channing, Betty Grable, Sid Caesar, Jonathan Winters, Jean Stapleton, Robert Goulet, William Conrad and Liza Minnelli.

Also, several notable character actors were used in the comedy sketches in featured roles, especially in the earlier seasons. Such actors include William Schallert, Isabel Sanford, Vivian Bonnell, and Reta Shaw. Lesser-known actors who appeared include Brad Trumbull, Bob Duggan, Dick Patterson, and Inga Neilsen.

===Opening===
A favorite feature consisted of an unrehearsed question-and-answer segment with the audience in CBS Studio 33 lasting about three to four minutes at the start of most shows. Burnett stated that she borrowed the concept from Garry Moore, who did the same on his variety show, but never taped it. Burnett asked for the lights to be turned up (&quot;Let&#x27;s turn up the lights...&quot;) and then randomly picked audience members who raised their hands. Burnett often ad-libbed funny answers, but occasionally ended up as the straight (wo)man. For example:

:Young woman: &quot;Have you ever taken acting lessons?&quot;
:Carol: &quot;Yes, I have.&quot;
:Young woman: &quot;Do you think it did any good?&quot;

===Rehearsals and ad-libs===
The show was rehearsed each day until its two Friday tapings. Differently colored cue cards (black, blue, green, and red) were used for each major performer (&quot;Carol Burnett: Bump-Up the Lights&quot;). The second taping was fairly routine until Tim Conway came aboard as a guest star.
As a recurring guest star from the show&#x27;s launch and later a regular cast member, Conway inserted unrehearsed bits into sketches that became known to the staff as &quot;Conway&#x27;s Capers&quot;. Conway would play the first taping straight, but (if the sketch had played well in the first taping, and could be used) would ad-lib bizarre scenarios during the second. Some notable clips included Conway as a Nazi interrogator berating an American captive (Lyle Waggoner). Using a Hitler puppet and a pencil as a &quot;club&quot;, Conway sang &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Working on the Railroad&quot; as Waggoner tried in vain to ignore him. Some, like the Hitler puppet, made it into the final broadcast; others, like a notably convoluted story about Siamese elephants joined at the trunk (ad-libbed during a 1977 &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; sketch), were edited, the uncensored version only appearing years later on CBS specials. Conway&#x27;s favorite victim was Harvey Korman, who often broke character reacting to Conway&#x27;s zaniness, such as when Conway played a dentist misusing Novocain or the recurring role of &quot;The Oldest Man&quot; – an elderly, shuffling, senile man who slowly rolled down stairs and fell prey to various mechanical mishaps (including an electric wheelchair and an automated dry-cleaning rack).

===Ending===
The show also became known for its closing theme song, written by Burnett&#x27;s husband, Joe Hamilton, with these lyrics: 
:&quot;I&#x27;m so glad we had this time together&quot;
:&quot;Just to have a laugh or sing a song&quot;
:&quot;Seems we just get started and before you know it&quot;
:&quot;Comes the time we have to say, &quot;So long.&quot;&quot;

At the close of each episode, Burnett tugged her ear. This silent message was meant for her grandmother, who raised her, and meant she was thinking of her at that moment. After her grandmother&#x27;s death, Burnett continued the tradition.

==Broadcast==
When &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; made its network debut on CBS-TV on September 11, 1967, it was scheduled on Mondays at 10:00 pm (EST) opposite NBC&#x27;s &quot;I Spy&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Big Valley&quot;. At the end of its first season and through the spring of 1971, it consistently ranked among the top-30 programs. (For the 1969–70 season, it posted its highest rating ever, ranking at number 13.) For season five, CBS moved the show to Wednesdays at 8:00 pm (EST), where its chief competition was NBC&#x27;s &quot;Adam-12&quot; and the ABC sitcoms &quot;Bewitched&quot; and &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot;. Despite the schedule change, the show continued to do well until the fall of 1972, when the ratings slipped. In December 1972, CBS again moved &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; to Saturdays at 10:00 pm (EST) where, for the next four years, it not only received solid ratings, but was also part of a powerhouse Saturday-night lineup of primetime shows that included &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, and &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;.

In the 1973–74 season, the &quot;Family&quot; sketches (with Burnett as Eunice, Korman as her husband Ed, and Lawrence as Eunice&#x27;s mother) were introduced and the &quot;Carol and Sis&quot; segments were phased out. At the end of that season (the series&#x27; seventh), after having been with &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; from the beginning, Lyle Waggoner left the series to pursue other acting opportunities. The following season, Waggoner&#x27;s spot as a supporting regular remained vacant. Don Crichton, the lead male dancer on the show, began to inherit some of Waggoner&#x27;s duties. Then in season nine, because of his many popular guest appearances on the series, Tim Conway was signed as a full-time regular, joining Korman and Lawrence.
In November 1976, the series&#x27; tenth year, &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; presented what would become one of its best-known and most well-regarded sketches: &quot;Went with the Wind!&quot; a parody of the 1939 film &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, which had its television debut on NBC the week before. After the 1976–77 season ended, Harvey Korman decided to leave the series. After a decade of working with Burnett and winning several Emmy Awards, Korman had been offered a contract by ABC to headline his own series. Also, the ratings had begun to decline with the series ending its 10th season in 44th place as opposed to the previous year&#x27;s Nielsen rating at No. 29. Nevertheless, CBS renewed Burnett&#x27;s show for an 11th season.

Dick Van Dyke, fresh from headlining his own short-lived Emmy-winning variety series, &quot;Van Dyke &amp; Company&quot;, was brought in to replace Korman. However, his presence did not help stem the sagging ratings, as the show faced new competition in ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. After three months, Van Dyke departed the show, and CBS, in a desperate attempt to save the series, moved &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; from Saturdays at 10:00 pm (EST) to Sundays at the same hour, beginning in December 1977. Regular guest stars Steve Lawrence and Ken Berry were brought in to fill the void left by Korman and Van Dyke. The ratings improved considerably.

CBS wanted to renew the show for another year, but by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre, despite her success in it. With the changes in cast along with the mediocre ratings, she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out. Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later. Thus, on March 29, 1978, in a special two-hour finale entitled &quot;A Special Evening with Carol Burnett&quot;, &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; left primetime television after 11 years, finishing its last season in 66th place. Reruns were aired during the summer of 1978.

==Characters and sketches==


This is only a short list with brief descriptions of the show&#x27;s well-known characters and sketches.

*As the Stomach Turns – a soap opera parody taking place in the fictional town of Canoga Falls with Burnett as the main character Marian Clayton
*Carol and Sis – Burnett as Carol and Vicki Lawrence as her sister Chris with Korman as Carol&#x27;s husband Roger
*Charwoman – Burnett&#x27;s signature character, an unnamed charwoman, most often in a musical number, whose animated image has been used in the opening credits, and also in the opening and closing credits of &quot;Carol Burnett and Friends&quot;
*The Family – Burnett and Korman as Eunice and Ed Higgins, a married couple, with Lawrence portraying Eunice&#x27;s very difficult mother &quot;Mama&quot; Thelma Harper
*Nora Desmond – Burnett as a has-been silent film actress and Korman as her bald, dutiful butler Max in the take-off of the 1950 film &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;
*The Oldest Man – Conway as Duane Toddleberry, an old, slow-moving man, usually in various situations involving Korman being annoyed with his lack of speed
*V.I.P. – Korman as F. Lee Carman, who interviews famous &quot;celebrities&quot;, parodied by Burnett, such as Julia Wild (Julia Child), Shirley Dimple (Shirley Temple) and Mae East (Mae West), as well as other guests such as a nudist
*Movie Parodies, spoofs of popular movies, most notably Went with the Wind!; others included &quot;Jowls&quot;, &quot;Mildred Fierce&quot;, &quot;The Lavender Pimpernel&quot;, &quot;Natural Velvet&quot; and more.
*Mrs. Wiggins – Conway as Mr. Tudball, a businessman who speaks in a mock Romanian accent, putting up with his empty-headed secretary Mrs. Wiggins played by Burnett.
*The Queen, Burnett as a monarch patterned after Queen Elizabeth II, Harvey Korman as her consort and Tim Conway as Private Arthur Newberry.
*Commercial Parodies, spoofs of then-current television commercial spots.

==After the series==

===Continuations and revivals===
In the fall of 1977, while the series was still running in prime time, the comedy sketches of the show were re-edited into freestanding programs; the resulting show enjoyed success for many years in syndicated reruns as &quot;Carol Burnett and Friends&quot;, a half-hour edition of selected 1972–77 material.

In the spring of 1979, a year after &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; left the air, Burnett and her husband Joe Hamilton were dining in a restaurant with friends, including Tim Conway. At that gathering, Burnett got wistful and started reminiscing about the show and making suggestions to Conway concerning sketches that she wished they could be creating if the show were still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series. Taking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979. CBS already had its schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea. However, ABC was interested, and as a result, four postscript episodes of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; were produced. Under the title &quot;Carol Burnett &amp; Company&quot;, the show premiered on Saturday, August 18, 1979, and included many favorite sketches such as &quot;Mr. Tudball and Mrs. Wiggins&quot;, &quot;The Family&quot;, &quot;As The Stomach Turns&quot;, and Burnett doing her impersonation of Queen Elizabeth II. Its format was very much similar to Burnett&#x27;s series, with two exceptions. Due to the unavailability of Harvey Korman (who, ironically, had been under contract to ABC since he had left Burnett&#x27;s show in 1977), comic actors Kenneth Mars and Craig Richard Nelson were added to the supporting cast, joining Lawrence and Conway. Ernie Flatt, who had been the choreographer on Burnett&#x27;s show for its entire 11-year run, was replaced by the show&#x27;s lead dancer Don Crichton. The guest stars in that four-week period were (chronologically) Cheryl Ladd, Alan Arkin, Penny Marshall, and Sally Field. The reviews of the series were very favorable, with several critics heartily welcoming Burnett back to weekly television, albeit on a limited basis. The ratings also were respectable and plans were announced for the program to become a yearly summer event, but it never happened.

In 1980, Joe Hamilton produced &quot;The Tim Conway Show&quot;, a variety series in the same vein with Conway as host and much of the staff of &quot;Carol Burnett &amp; Company&quot; carrying over. Harvey Korman would join Conway as a co-host later in the show&#x27;s short run; it ended in 1981.

The &quot;Family&quot; sketches led to a 1982 CBS made-for-television film called &quot;Eunice&quot; starring Burnett, Korman, Lawrence, Betty White, and Ken Berry. The success of this program spawned a spin-off sitcom titled &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, starring Vicki Lawrence and Ken Berry, which ran from 1983 to 1990. It occasionally featured Burnett and Korman guest-starring as Eunice and Ed Higgins; Burnett&#x27;s involvement in &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; was limited due to her divorce from producer Joe Hamilton. In the first year and a half of the show&#x27;s run, Korman also appeared as narrator Alastair Quince, introducing each episode (a parody of Alastair Cooke hosting &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;) and he also directed 31 episodes of the series.

NBC aired a comedy half-hour repertory series called &quot;Carol &amp; Company&quot; that premiered in March 1990. It proved to be moderately successful in the ratings and was renewed for a second season. The regulars on the show included Peter Krause, Jeremy Piven, Terry Kiser, Meagen Fay, Anita Barone, and Richard Kind (and occasional guest stars, including Betty White and Burt Reynolds); each week&#x27;s show was a different half-hour comedy play. This program lasted until July 1991.

CBS brought back &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; for another run in the fall of 1991; new regulars included Meagen Fay and Richard Kind (brought over from the NBC show), and Chris Barnes, Roger Kabler, and Jessica Lundy. However, the times had changed and Burnett&#x27;s humor was tame compared to the edgier comedy popular in the 1990s. The series failed to catch on with the public and only six episodes of this revival were aired.

In 1996, reruns of the syndicated &quot;Carol Burnett and Friends&quot; package aired on The Family Channel. It also aired on TV Land from 2004 to 2005. Beginning in January 2015, the show airs on MeTV at 11:00 PM ET.

The episodes of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; from 1967 to 1972 had never been released in syndication until 2019, when MeTV added the episodes to its library on April 14, 2019.

==Legacy==
Considering her large body of work, and due in great part to this TV show, Burnett received Kennedy Center Honors in 2003, and was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in October 2013.

In 2009, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;Went with the Wind&quot; number 53 on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes.

On September 13, 2016, Burnett released her memoir about the show titled &quot;In Such Good Company: Eleven Years of Laughter, Mayhem, and Fun in the Sandbox&quot;. The book, full of anecdotes about the 1967–1978 variety series, covers the history of how Burnett created the show, how she cast her co-stars, the co-star she once fired (and quickly rehired), and all of the show&#x27;s memorable characters. The audio format of the book, which she narrated, won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.

==Home media==
In the early 2000s, certain full-length episodes of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; were released on VHS and DVD by Columbia House on a subscription basis (now discontinued). Guthy-Renker released another DVD collection, &quot;The Carol Burnett Show Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;.

In August 2012, Time–Life released &quot;The Carol Burnett Show - The Ultimate Collection&quot; on DVD in Region 1. This 22-disc set features 50 episodes from the series, selected by Burnett. It also contains bonus features, including interviews with the cast, featurettes, sketches that were never aired, and a 24-page commemorative booklet.

In August 2015, Time–Life released &quot;The Carol Burnett Show - The Lost Episodes&quot; on DVD in Region 1. This 22-disc set features 45 episodes from the series&#x27; first five years (1967–72), selected by Burnett. It also contains bonus features, including interviews with the cast, featurettes, and a 24-page commemorative booklet. Previously, due to an ongoing legal battle with the production company Bob Banner Associates, the episodes from those seasons had never appeared in syndication nor been released on home media.

On April 27, 2020, Shout! Factory announced that all 11 seasons of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; would be available for viewing through their streaming channel beginning June 1, 2020, kicked off by a two-day marathon of episodes hand-picked by Burnett. The marathon would be available on Shout! Factory&#x27;s website, streaming device channel, Twitch channel, and YouTube channel on May 30 and 31, 2020. This is the first time the complete series will be available on a streaming platform, although the episodes themselves are all edited down to 22 minutes, resulting in 30 minutes removed from each episode. These same episodes, edited-down from the original broadcast 52 minutes to 22 minutes, were subsequently carried by Amazon Prime Video.

==Repeat broadcasts==
Half-hour edited episodes are broadcast on MeTV and full hour episodes on the Catchy Comedy channel.

<text>Saloio is a brand of Portuguese cheese manufactured in the region of Ponte do Rol, north of Lisbon. It is made from sheep&#x27;s milk with no salt. It is a firm cheese usually served in small cylinders that are 5 cm wide and 6 cm high.

Another meaning of &quot;saloio&quot; is of a non-urban person, i.e., a person living outside a large city in the countryside. Originally it was a term applied to someone who lives in the rural areas surrounding Lisbon, the capital of Portugal.

<text>Lucas &quot;Luke&quot; Cage, born Carl Lucas and also known as Power Man, is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Archie Goodwin, George Tuska, Roy Thomas, and John Romita Sr. in 1972, he was the first African–American superhero by Marvel Comics to be the main character in his own series. Stories featuring Luke Cage often relate to issues of race and class. His origin invokes criticism of police brutality and the prison system in the United States, and his 1970s stories focus on his efforts to support himself as a businessman. His creators were initially inspired by Blaxploitation cinema and subsequently by the Black Power movement. The character was intensely masculine and sexualized in his 20th century appearances, but these aspects were tempered as Cage&#x27;s focus shifted to his life as a husband and father.

Cage was introduced in &quot;Luke Cage, Hero for Hire&quot; #1 (June 1972); he was the first Black superhero to star in his own regular title. His series was renamed &quot;Power Man&quot; with issue #17 (1974) and then &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; with issue #50 (1978), when Iron Fist became his costar. The series ended after issue #125 (1986), and he then briefly starred in the miniseries &quot;Cage&quot; (1992). The character was generally neglected and received little commercial success or broad popularity in the 1990s. 

However, writer Brian Michael Bendis redesigned Cage for &quot;Alias&quot; (2001), and the character then appeared in another series titled &quot;Cage&quot; (2002) under the Max imprint. In 2004, Bendis incorporated Cage into the Avengers. He wrote Cage as a main character in &quot;The New Avengers&quot; (2004–2010), &quot;The Pulse&quot; (2004), &quot;The Mighty Avengers&quot; (2013–2015), and &quot;The Defenders&quot; (2017–2018). Other series featuring Luke Cage have been published, such as &quot;Luke Cage: Noir&quot; (2009), a new volume of &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; (2016), the comedic series &quot;CAGE!&quot; (2016), and &quot;Luke Cage: Gang War&quot; (2023).

Carl Lucas gained superhuman strength and unbreakable skin after being the subject of an experiment while in prison. Having been falsely imprisoned, he uses his powers to escape and starts a business as the Hero for Hire under the name Luke Cage. He then teams up with Iron Fist and clears his name. He marries Jessica Jones and they have a daughter together while Cage joins the New Avengers, the Mighty Avengers, and the Defenders. Cage runs in the New York mayoral election against Wilson Fisk and is elected mayor. Along with Iron Fist and Jessica Jones, Cage&#x27;s supporting characters include his friend David Griffith and the doctor Claire Temple. His archenemy is Diamondback, a career criminal and Cage&#x27;s friend-turned-enemy who caused him to be wrongfully arrested. Other recurring villains faced by Cage include Black Mariah, Cockroach Hamilton, Comanche, Cottonmouth, Gideon Mace, and Shades.

Mike Colter portrays Luke Cage in &quot;Jessica Jones&quot; (2015), &quot;Luke Cage&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Defenders&quot; (2017) in Marvel&#x27;s Netflix television series within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

==Publication history==
=== Creation ===

Luke Cage was created by Archie Goodwin, John Romita Sr., Roy Thomas, and George Tuska. Marvel Comics publisher Stan Lee wanted to create a character based on the Blaxploitation subgenre of action films popular in the 1970s. The films, such as &quot;Shaft&quot; (1971) and &quot;Super Fly&quot; (1972), were the inspiration for Luke Cage. Lee worked with Thomas on the initial premise of a hero who asks payment for his work. Thomas attributed many of the creative decisions to Lee.

When developing Cage&#x27;s abilities, Thomas was inspired by the Philip Wylie novel &quot;Gladiator&quot; (1930). In the novel, the character Hugo Danner discovers he is bulletproof after examining where he is struck by machine gun fire during World War I. Dan Hagen of &quot;Back Issue!&quot; compared Cage&#x27;s origin to &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; by Alexandre Dumas, to which Thomas said that the book may have had &quot;a conscious or subconscious effect&quot; on Lee or Goodwin.

Romita created Cage&#x27;s initial design, and Tuska became the series&#x27; main artist. Goodwin wrote the first stories featuring Luke Cage. Billy Graham, the only Black artist working at Marvel at the time, was also brought on to ensure that Tuska&#x27;s &quot;African-American characters looked African-American&quot;. It was determined that he would at some point take over as artist for the character.

Marvel had previously created two Black superheroes: Black Panther and Falcon. However, Luke Cage was the first of Marvel&#x27;s African–American characters to lead his own series. He was developed during a period of increasing racial diversity in comic books and popular media more broadly. American society at the time was undergoing a shift in racial attitudes, and calls for social justice and against racism were increasing. The character was distinct from other superheroes because he lived in poverty and struggled with practical affairs like supporting himself and starting a business. During internal deliberations, Marvel determined that Cage had the best marketing potential of their properties.

=== 1970s ===
Cage was introduced in &quot;Luke Cage, Hero for Hire&quot;, in 1972. The series alternated between its continuing plot of Cage trying to support himself and address problems in his personal life, alongside secondary plots each issue in which Cage completed a job as a hero for hire. Goodwin wrote the first four issues before Steve Englehart became the writer. Tuska was the series&#x27; artist, but Graham worked as inker and frequently shared responsibilities with Tuska as penciler. Englehart and Tuska came into conflict while working on &quot;Luke Cage, Hero for Hire&quot;. Englehart wrote subplots for the series, only for Tuska to disregard them and say &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel like drawing that&quot;. In issue #8 (1973), Luke Cage is described with the racial slur &quot;schvartze&quot;. According to Englehart, he was not aware it was a slur and was tricked into adding it by Tuska. Englehart printed an apology in issue #11.

Marvel made a stronger push toward representation of Black characters in 1973. Reframing the character, the company announced that &quot;much of Cage&#x27;s jivin&#x27; slang will be eliminated&quot;. Cage made an appearance outside of his own series when he fought with Spider-Man in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #123 (1973). The issue was illustrated by Gil Kane and John Romita Sr. Graham became the main artist for Luke Cage beginning with issue #13 (1973). The character and the series were renamed &quot;Power Man&quot; in issue #17 (1974). The name was inspired by the Black power movement, and according to Thomas the change was made in an attempt to increase sales. Cage appeared in &quot;The Defenders&quot; #17–19 (1974–1975), which had him fight the Defenders before they work together to stop the Wrecking Crew.

Cage did not have a dedicated writer in the issues after Englehart&#x27;s departure, so several writers briefly contributed. Tuska remained active as an artist for the series at this time. Don McGregor eventually requested writing duties for &quot;Power Man&quot;, and he worked on issues #28 and #30–35. A production problem prevented him from writing issue #29, leaving issue #28&#x27;s cliffhanger open as an alternate story was featured in issue #29. McGregor made various additions to the character during his brief run, including several of Cage&#x27;s classic villains. McGregor glamorized Cage&#x27;s ability to persevere through suffering. The series went through several artists at this time. Cage also co-starred in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #168 (1976), when Roy Thomas used him to briefly replace the Thing as a member of the Fantastic Four. Marv Wolfman became Cage&#x27;s writer after issue #36 (1976). &quot;Power Man&quot; was accompanied by an annual edition the same year, created by Chris Claremont. The duo of Claremont and John Byrne were then made artists for the series, continuing a period of collaborations between the two.

The martial arts superhero Iron Fist joined the series as a co-star in issue #48 (1978), and the series was renamed &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; with issue #50 (1978). They were grouped together after neither character proved popular enough to support his own series. Jo Duffy, a fan of both characters, was appointed as its writer at her request beginning with issue #56. Cage&#x27;s innocence was proven in this story arc, and he was no longer written as an escaped convict. To elevate Luke Cage and Iron Fist, Duffy and artist Trevor Von Eeden began with a story in which the characters encountered the X-Men and the Living Monolith before returning them to more mundane environments.

=== 1980s–1990s===
&quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; received its long-term artist when Kerry Gammill was added for issue #61 (1980). Gammill continued drawing the series until issue #79 (1982), and Duffy continued writing it until issue #84 (1982). Their editor, Dennis O&#x27;Neil, disliked the light-hearted and humorous tone that Duffy had used for the series. Denys Cowan took over for Gammill. Bob Layton was announced as Duffy&#x27;s replacement, but he never began and O&#x27;Neil filled in until Kurt Busiek became writer with issue #90 (1983). Busiek continued the light-hearted tone and he too was removed from the series, ending his run on issue #102 (1984). The series had no dedicated creators or storylines until Christopher Priest became the writer from issue #111 (1984) until the series&#x27; cancellation with issue #125 (1986), working alongside artist M. D. Bright. Priest, who was himself Black, was criticized within Marvel for reducing Cage&#x27;s use of stereotypical Black dialogue.

After Marvel canceled &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot;, Cage spent the remainder of the decade making guest appearances in other comics. He was revitalized with a new series, &quot;Cage&quot;, in 1992. This series removed the blaxploitation elements of the character, tempering him and putting him in common street clothes. With minimal resemblance to the original depiction of the character, the series was not well-received and it sold poorly. It was canceled after 20 issues. Cage then made an appearance in &quot;Marvels&quot; (1994), where artist Alex Ross used Jim Brown as a model for Luke Cage&#x27;s design. The character made an appearance in a parody edition of &quot;What If&quot; where he found and wielded Mjolnir, the hammer of Thor. Another attempt was made to revive the character in 1996 with the publication of a new Luke Cage and Iron Fist duo series, &quot;Heroes for Hire&quot;, but it was canceled after 19 issues.

=== 2000s ===

By the start of the 21st century, Luke Cage was not meaningfully used by Marvel and was seen as outdated following the end of the blaxploitation era. The writer Brian Michael Bendis created an updated version of Luke Cage in 2001, making him a supporting character in the series &quot;Alias&quot;, in which Cage is a romantic interest for the main character Jessica Jones. According to Bendis, he was teased by his colleagues for his insistence on the character&#x27;s inclusion, who called it a &quot;man-crush&quot;. A new &quot;Cage&quot; series was published under the adult-targeted Max imprint in 2002, featuring more explicit content. Created by Brian Azzarello, Richard Corben, and José Villarrubia, this series portrayed the Black community in a more stereotypical way and had Cage work as muscle for hire in less heroic circumstances. It has been described as Luke Cage redesigned for hip-hop culture.

Bendis used Cage again as a main character in &quot;The New Avengers&quot;, which took place after the 2004 &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot; storyline. He decided to have Cage shave his head in the second issue, inspired by a similar style change by comedian Damon Wayans, and the new look became standard for the character&#x27;s appearance. Cage concurrently returned in Bendis&#x27;s next Jessica Jones series, &quot;The Pulse&quot;, beginning in 2004. Jones is pregnant with Cage&#x27;s daughter throughout this series, and issues #11–14 (2005–2006) feature the child&#x27;s birth and Cage&#x27;s subsequent marriage proposal to Jones. Her acceptance and their wedding are depicted in &quot;The New Avengers Annual&quot; #1 (2006). Cage was also one of the guest stars in the Black Panther storyline &quot;Bad Mutha&quot; in 2006, along with Blade and Brother Voodoo.

Cage&#x27;s continued appearances in &quot;The New Avengers&quot; focused on his new life as a husband and father. This coincided with the company-wide storylines &quot;Civil War&quot;, &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;, &quot;Dark Reign&quot;, and &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot;, between 2005 and 2012. &quot;Civil War&quot; compels him to fight against other superheroes and send his family into hiding. Cage invokes Black history in order to challenge Iron Man&#x27;s strict adherence to the law, recalling slavery and the civil rights movement. Cage then has his own subplot in &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;, in which he aligns with Norman Osborn in order to locate his kidnapped daughter. Cage remains a major character in &quot;The New Avengers&quot; until its conclusion in &quot;The New Avengers: Finale&quot; (2010). He was simultaneously a major character in &quot;House of M: Avengers&quot; (2008), where he is depicted in his original design. A film noir version of Luke Cage was also depicted in &quot;Luke Cage Noir&quot; (2009–2010), set in the 1920s.

=== 2010s–2020s ===
&quot;The New Avengers: Luke Cage&quot; was published in 2010, containing the three-part &quot;Town Without Pity&quot; storyline set in Philadelphia, written by John Arcudi and illustrated by Eric Canete. It was published alongside a one-shot in which Daredevil and Cage fight for charity, written by Antony Johnston and illustrated by Sean Chen. &quot;Avengers Origins: Luke Cage&quot; was then published in 2013, written by Michael Benson and Adam Glass. Cage was one of several Black superheroes teamed together in &quot;The Mighty Avengers&quot; (2013–2014) and &quot;Captain America and the Mighty Avengers&quot; (2014–2015).

A new volume of &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; began publication in 2016 as part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel branding, written by David F. Walker and illustrated by Sanford Greene. &quot;CAGE!&quot; was published the same year as a comedic interpretation of Cage&#x27;s original design. This series, first announced in 2007, was written and illustrated by Genndy Tartakovsky. A new &quot;Luke Cage&quot; series began publication in 2017 to coincide with the &quot;Luke Cage&quot; television series. The first five issues made up the &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; story arc, written by David F. Walker and illustrated by Nelson Blake. The series was then rebranded under Marvel Legacy, which adjusted the series&#x27; numbering. The &quot;Caged&quot; story arc was published as issues #166–170. Walker remained as the writer while Guillermo Sanna and Marcio Menyz were its artists. It was canceled in 2018 after issue #170. Brian Michael Bendis wrote &quot;The Defenders&quot; with artist David Marquez in 2017, placing Cage in a team alongside Iron Fist, Jessica Jones, and Daredevil to coincide with the television adaptations of these characters. The same year, Cage also appeared in a new team led by Black Panther, The Crew in a series written by Ta-Nehisi Coates. Cage worked alongside Storm, Misty Knight, and Manifold.

The three-issue series &quot;Luke Cage: Everyman&quot; was released in 2018 as the second publication in the Marvel Digital Original line, written by Anthony Del Col and illustrated by Jahnoy Lindsay.

A miniseries titled &quot;Luke Cage: City of Fire&quot; began production, written by Ho Che Anderson, with an expected release date in 2021. The series would have featured a story about police brutality based on the murder of George Floyd, but Marvel canceled it shortly before its release out of fear that it would provoke retaliation. According to Anderson, executives told him it was canceled so he would not be &quot;attacked by right-wing nuts&quot;. Cage appeared as a major character in the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Reign&quot; event in 2021, which ended with him becoming mayor of New York City. He then received his own tie-in series for the &quot;Gang War&quot; event that began in 2023. &quot;Luke Cage: Gang War&quot; was written by Rodney Barnes and illustrated by Ramon Bachs, depicting Cage&#x27;s time as mayor and his decision to resume vigilantism.

== Characterization ==

=== Fictional character biography ===
Carl Lucas is a resident of Harlem. He was in a gang with his friend Willis Stryker until having regrets about a criminal life and leaving. When Stryker&#x27;s girlfriend breaks up with him and seeks out Lucas, Stryker frames Lucas for drug possession. Lucas is sent to prison and is abused when he refuses to be an informant. He agrees to a dangerous experiment in the hope that it will help him get parole, but the experiment is sabotaged by a racist corrections officer in an attempt to kill him. The experiment inadvertently gives Lucas superhuman strength and nearly impenetrable skin, which he uses to escape. When he stops a robber and receives a cash reward, he decides to start a business as a super-powered private detective. Lucas takes on a new name, Luke Cage, and he later starts calling himself Power Man.

When Cage is blackmailed by Bushmaster to kidnap Misty Knight, he meets Knight&#x27;s boyfriend, Iron Fist. They work together to prove Cage&#x27;s innocence, and they become partners as the Heroes for Hire. Cage becomes a fugitive again when he is blamed for Iron Fist&#x27;s apparent death, but Iron Fist is eventually found to be alive. For a time, Cage moves his Hero for Hire operations to Chicago. Cage moves away from hero work as a bodyguard and bar owner, and he has a sexual encounter with his friend Jessica Jones. The two fall in love while working on a bodyguard job together for Matt Murdock, Daredevil&#x27;s alter ego. They go on to have a daughter together and marry each other. Cage was one of several heroes who responded to a breakout from the supervillain prison the Raft, and they join together to become the New Avengers. He refuses to register after the Superhero Registration Act is passed and he aligns with Captain America&#x27;s resistance, separating him from his family and making him a fugitive.

Cage&#x27;s daughter is kidnapped by a shapeshifting alien Skrull during the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;. In his desperation, he agrees to register and aligns with then-head of S.H.I.E.L.D., the villain Norman Osborn, and he recovers his daughter. He then attacks Osborn&#x27;s henchmen, sparing Osborn only because of his assistance in finding the child. After Osborn&#x27;s rule ends, Cage becomes the leader of another group of New Avengers and takes command of the reformed supervillain team the Thunderbolts. Cage retires from heroism after realizing the stakes of living his lifestyle while having a child, but he later joins the Mighty Avengers and then a new version of the Defenders. He is diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy as a consequence of his violent lifestyle. Cage runs to be mayor of New York, challenging Mayor Wilson Fisk. Following Fisk&#x27;s arrest, Cage runs unopposed and is elected.

=== Personality and motivations ===
Cage was shaped by his life in poverty in Harlem, where he was forced to become a criminal and learn to survive. While in poverty, he expresses more frustration when his enemies destroy his office than when they attack him personally, understanding that he will have to pay to fix the damage. He has disdain for the wealthy East Side in Manhattan, seeing the neighborhood and its residents as artificial. He takes satisfaction in his business as he becomes more successful and upgrades his office. After moving his operations to Times Square, he retains his previous office over a grindhouse theater in a poorer part of the city to ensure that he is still accessible to the working class. His financial concerns are alleviated after he partners with his wealthier ally Iron Fist.

The character&#x27;s anger defines Cage when he is first introduced, bitter about the injustice of his false imprisonment. His experiences living in Harlem and being experimented on in prison made him cynical. Cage is believed dead after he receives his powers, separating him from society more than a traditional superhero. Rather than act purely out of altruism, Cage seeks compensation for heroic acts. He believes that this altruism is unrealistic when race and class are taken into consideration. Despite this, he sometimes refuses to accept a fee. By the third issue of &quot;Luke Cage, Hero for Hire&quot;, Cage returns his fee to a widowed mother whose husband had hired him.

Cage is portrayed as highly masculine, especially in the context of African–American culture. This is closely associated with his origin inspired by Blaxploitation films, where such hypermasculinity is common. He is written as promiscuous and highly sexual, especially in his youth. He is embarrassed by this past when his old sexual partners continue making advances after he is married. Other characters understand him to be a &quot;cape chaser&quot; who had regular sexual encounters with female superheroes. As Cage&#x27;s character evolved, more nuanced traits were allowed to develop as he became husband and father and as he balanced his superheroism between street crime and more traditional supervillains. His characterization underwent a major shift in &quot;The New Avengers&quot;, which reframes him as a paternal figure who cares for his infant daughter while serving as a mentor for younger superheroes who are racial minorities. He is shown as a responsible, caring father while other heroes are fighting. Part of his motivation for joining the team is so that his soon-to-be-born daughter will be able to hear that her father was an Avenger. This leads to further conflict with Cage&#x27;s split roles as a father and a superhero, as the dangerous nature of his work puts his daughter at risk and causes his wife to doubt his sincerity about prioritizing the family. His romantic relationship with Jessica Jones became his primary focus, eventually accompanied by their daughter together.

Cage does not present himself aesthetically as a traditional superhero. He does not consistency use a superhero name or wear a superhero costume. He does not have a secret identity, though he changed his name to Luke Cage while in hiding after escaping prison. Cage wears an extravagant street-clothes outfit in his original design, featuring a bright yellow top with a collar and open front, black spandex pants, yellow-trimmed boots, a chain belt, metal bracelets, and a metal headband. This outfit both reflects his inability to afford more sophisticated costumes and balances the seriousness of the character. When the character chooses these outfits, he remarks that the chains will remind him of his past imprisonment, as well as the possibility that he could be imprisoned again. He similarly chooses the name Cage to invoke his origin as a prisoner. He later wears more casual outfits like a t-shirt with jeans. Cage is associated with a catchphrase, &quot;Sweet Christmas!&quot;, which he often exclaimed in the 1970s.

=== Powers and abilities ===
Luke Cage has superhuman strength and durability. He gained his powers through an experiment, described as an &quot;electro-biochemical process&quot; that was intended to improve human healing by speeding up cellular regeneration. Cage&#x27;s skin is as strong as steel, his muscles and bones are much denser than those of an average human, and he can heal three times as quickly. Cage&#x27;s powers are more defensive than active, making him a relatively passive character in combat. When the character was created, a rule was implemented that he could not use his powers to leap high into the air, but this rule was broken by his sixth appearance. Besides his superhuman abilities, Cage is street smart and a skilled fighter.

== Themes ==
Race and its social implications are prominent in Luke Cage stories. Luke Cage is symbolic of the resistance to racism that defined the Black identity in the United States, and the character explores problems faced by African–Americans because of institutional racism. Cage&#x27;s symbolism arises from his being a Black man with bulletproof skin. The fact that his powers are derived from his skin creates a contrast where his skin is both what causes him to be persecuted and what gives him the ability to fight back. The character originated from the Black power movement, although this interpretation of the character receded by the 1980s as the Black power movement declined in prominence and the Black power hero moved out of the cultural zeitgeist. 

Prison reform had become a major political issue in the years leading up to Cage&#x27;s debut, and &quot;Luke Cage, Hero for Hire&quot; introduced the character alongside a criticism of police brutality and the prison system in the United States. Cage&#x27;s origin as both a superhero and a prisoner makes him distinct from other superheroes with more traditionally noble origins. Unlike the heroic experiment that gave Captain America his superpowers and the science-fiction themes of later superheroes, Cage is given his powers in the less glamorous environment of a prison experiment. Shortly after Cage&#x27;s first appearance, news of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study became public as a real-life example of Black men being experimented on.

Issues relating to class are a regular feature in Luke Cage stories, and Cage&#x27;s persona draws from a tradition of urban folk heroes who represent the working class. This contrasted him from Marvel&#x27;s other well known Black superhero of the time, the Black Panther, the king of a highly developed African nation. Cage&#x27;s origin gives focus to the financial aspects of superheroism as the character has to fund his own operations. Cage operates out of New York like many other Marvel Comics superheroes, but his origin is in the inner city as opposed to more affluent or suburban areas. This setting depicts less desirable aspects of New York City relative to the settings of other superhero stories, showing a poorer, rougher area.

Cage&#x27;s public blending of his career and his heroism subverts the usual trope of heroes trying to keep these things separate. The transactional nature of Cage&#x27;s heroism challenges the notion of a selfless hero being morally superior. It indicates that social privilege and financial stability are necessary for a hero to act without compensation, which is not an option for working class heroes like Luke Cage. This theme became less prominent a few years into Luke Cage&#x27;s publications as the series shifted toward more traditional heroics to boost sales. Cage&#x27;s balancing of his life as a father and as a superhero then became a major theme used to comment on the fatherhood of Black men and domestic life more generally. Several franchise-wide storylines took place while Cage learned to become a father, presenting obstacles for the character in his attempts to prioritize his family. Cage&#x27;s role in these stories subverts common ideas of absent fathers and masculinity being incompatible with domesticity when he remains committed to his responsibility as a father.

== Supporting characters ==

Luke Cage is closely tied to the character Iron Fist. They were brought together for the shared series &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; in 1978 where they came to be partners. Cage&#x27;s primary romantic interest is Jessica Jones. Their relationship becomes central to his character after their marriage, and they have a daughter named Danielle. Cage formed a team, the Defenders, with Jones, Iron Fist, and Daredevil. He has worked with other teams, including the New Avengers.

In the first issues of his original series, Cage is established with the supporting characters Claire Temple, a doctor who operates a clinic with the man who gave Cage his powers, and David Griffith, the nephew of his landlord who becomes a friend of Cage. Cage&#x27;s first love interest is Reva Connors. In his origin story, Willis Stryker competes with Cage for her attention, eventually framing Cage and getting him sent to prison. Connors is then accidentally killed in a mob hit targeting Stryker.

=== Villains ===
Luke Cage&#x27;s original nemesis is his friend-turned-rival Willis Stryker, who calls himself Diamondback. The pair were partners who became involved in gangs, but Cage left the lifestyle while Stryker became more involved in it. Diamondback becomes his own version of a hero for hire, using trick knives with different functionalities. Shades and Comanche are also villains Cage encounters in his origin, meeting them as fellow prisoners during his origin story. Other recurring villains introduced in Cage&#x27;s original series include Gideon Mace, Black Mariah, Chemistro, Stiletto, Steeplejack, Cockroach Hamilton, Mr. Fish, and Piranha Jones.

Cage&#x27;s earliest villains were underworld criminals, typically working for a crime boss or a criminal organization. He has faced several villains of this type, including Cottonmouth, Diamondback, Steeplejack, and Stilleto. Many of Cage&#x27;s villains are people who became criminals because they were unable to achieve social mobility, including Big Brother, Chemistro, Mr. Fish, and Piranha Jones. Cage shares the name &quot;Power Man&quot; with the villain Erik Josten, introduced in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #21 (1965), and the two first encounter one another in &quot;Power Man&quot; #21 (1974).

&quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; writer Jo Duffy commented on the difficulty of writing villains for the titular characters, saying that they are too strong to fight common criminals but too weak to fight powerful supervillains. To address this, she introduced the superpowered swordsman El Águila and the scheming mountaineer Montenegro.

== Reception and legacy ==
Luke Cage was created as African-American heroes were first becoming acceptable to the American public, and the writers at Marvel developed the character to support this movement. Cage was positively received by readers when he was introduced, both for representation that came with an African–American superhero and for the means of exploring class and race in comic books. The 2016 television adaptation of Luke Cage similarly debuted during a period of renewed interest in how police brutality in the United States affects Black men.

Although the character was successful, Cage did not achieve the same popularity as Marvel&#x27;s more well-known characters. Marvel introduced several Black superheroes shortly after Luke Cage&#x27;s success, including Blade and Brother Voodoo in 1973 as well as Storm and Black Goliath in 1975. Black Panther received his own series in 1974. As solo characters, none of these were as successful as Luke Cage. Like these heroes, Cage was defined by his Blackness when he was introduced and was portrayed in a stereotypical manner, which received mixed reception from critics. Cage did not have significant effect on the Marvel Universe, leaving the niche of an influential African–American superhero unfilled for the time.

Several individual Luke Cage stories have received critical praise. &quot;Hero for Hire&quot; #9 (1973) has Cage pursue one of Marvel&#x27;s most imposing supervillains, Doctor Doom, over a $200 debt. &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; #50 (1978) saw Cage clear his name as a fugitive and marked the beginning of his sharing a series with Iron Fist as the Heroes for Hire. &quot;New Avengers&quot; #22 (2006) defined the character&#x27;s motives as he sided against Iron Man in the &quot;Civil War&quot; event. The miniseries &quot;Luke Cage: Noir&quot; (2009) reimagined Cage as a detective in a story praised for its style.

Cage was satirized by the Milestone Comics character &quot;Buck Wild, Mercenary Man&quot;. The actor Nicolas Cage, born Nicolas Coppola, was a fan of Luke Cage and chose his stage name as an homage to the character.

&quot;Wizard Magazine&quot; ranked Luke Cage 34th in their &quot;Top 200 Comic Book Characters&quot; list. &quot;Gizmodo&quot; ranked Luke Cage 23rd in their &quot;Every Member Of The Avengers&quot; list. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Luke Cage 11th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every Avenger ever&quot; list.

==In other media==

Mike Colter portrayed Luke Cage in &quot;Jessica Jones&quot; (2015), &quot;Luke Cage&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Defenders&quot; of Marvel&#x27;s Netflix television series within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Adaptations of Luke Cage have appeared in animated series like &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;The Super Hero Squad Show&quot; and &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot;. The character appears in several video games, including the &quot;&quot; series, &quot;Marvel Heroes&quot;, and &quot;Lego Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&quot;.

Quentin Tarantino considered making a film about Luke Cage in the early 1990s, hoping to cast Laurence Fishburne in the starring role, but he lost interest in the idea after his friends insisted that this was poor casting and he should instead choose Wesley Snipes. Producer Edward R. Pressman worked with Stan Lee on a possible Luke Cage film in 1995 starring Fishburne as the titular character. It would have been written by John Singleton and Joseph Dougherty, adapting the original series and the 1992 &quot;Cage&quot; miniseries and pitting Cage against the villain Moses Magnum. Another possible Luke Cage film was optioned by Columbia Pictures in 2003 with Ben Ramsey writing and John Singleton directing. Singleton considered Tyrese Gibson for the role of Luke Cage and Terrence Howard as Diamondback.

<doc id="448121" wikidata="Q1307876" url="?curid=448121" title="Siege of Fort Ticonderoga (1777)">
<text>The siege of Fort Ticonderoga occurred between 2 July and 6 July 1777 at Fort Ticonderoga, near the southern end of Lake Champlain in the state of New York. Lieutenant General John Burgoyne&#x27;s 8,000-man army occupied high ground above the fort, and nearly surrounded the defenses. These movements precipitated the occupying Continental Army, an under-strength force of 3,000 under the command of General Arthur St. Clair, to withdraw from Ticonderoga and the surrounding defenses. Some gunfire was exchanged, and there were some casualties, but there was no formal siege and no pitched battle. Burgoyne&#x27;s army occupied Fort Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, the extensive fortifications on the Vermont side of the lake, without opposition on 6 July. Advance units pursued the retreating Americans.

The uncontested surrender of Ticonderoga caused an uproar in the American public and in its military circles, as Ticonderoga was widely believed to be virtually impregnable, and a vital point of defense. General St. Clair and his superior, General Philip Schuyler, were vilified by Congress. Both were eventually exonerated in courts martial, but their careers were adversely affected. Schuyler had already lost his command to Horatio Gates by the time of the court martial, and St. Clair held no more field commands for the remainder of the war.

==Background==

In September 1775, early in the American Revolutionary War, the American Continental Army embarked on an invasion of Quebec. The invasion ended in disaster in July 1776, with the army chased back to Fort Ticonderoga by a large British army that arrived in Quebec in May 1776. A small Continental Navy fleet on Lake Champlain was defeated in the October 1776 Battle of Valcour Island. The delay required by the British to build their fleet on Lake Champlain caused General Guy Carleton to hold off on attempting an assault on Ticonderoga in 1776. Although his advance forces came within three miles of Ticonderoga, the lateness of the season and the difficulty of maintaining supply lines along the lake in winter caused him to withdraw his forces back into Quebec.

===British forces===

General John Burgoyne arrived in Quebec in May 1777 and prepared to lead the British forces assembled there south with the aim of gaining control of Ticonderoga and the Hudson River valley, dividing the rebellious provinces. The British Infantry included; 9th, 20th, 21st, 24th, 47th, 53rd, 62nd Regiments of Foot, King&#x27;s Loyal Americans, and Queen&#x27;s Loyal Rangers. The British force also consisted of a sizable Hessian force consisting of Prinz Ludwig&#x27;s Dragoons and Specht&#x27;s, Von Rhetz&#x27;s, Von Riedesel&#x27;s, Prinz Frederich&#x27;s, Erbprinz&#x27;s and Breyman&#x27;s Jäger regiments.

Most of these forces had arrived in 1776, and many participated in the campaign that drove the American army out of Quebec.

The total size of Burgoyne&#x27;s regular army was about 7,000. In addition to the regulars, there were about 800 Indians, and a relatively small number of Canadiens and Loyalists, who acted primarily as scouts and screening reconnaissance. The army was also accompanied by more than 1,000 civilians, including a pregnant woman, and Baroness Riedesel with her three small children. Including these non-military personnel, the total number of people in Burgoyne&#x27;s army was more than 10,000.

Burgoyne and General Carlton re-sited the troops at Fort Saint-Jean, near the northern end of Lake Champlain, on 14 June. By 21 June, the armada carrying the army was on the lake, and they had arrived at the unoccupied Fort Crown Point by 30 June. The Indians and other elements of the advance force laid down such an effective screen that the American defenders at Ticonderoga were unaware of either the exact location or strength of the force moving along the lake. While en route, Burgoyne authored a proclamation to the Americans, written in the turgid, pompous style for which he was well-known, and frequently criticized and parodied.

===American defenses===

American forces had occupied the forts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point since they captured them in May 1775 from a small garrison. In 1776 and 1777, they undertook significant efforts to improve the defenses surrounding Ticonderoga. A peninsula on the east side of the lake, renamed Mount Independence, was heavily fortified. To the north of old Fort Ticonderoga, the Americans built numerous redoubts, a large fort at the site earlier French fortifications, and a fort on Mount Hope. A quarter-mile long floating bridge was constructed across the lake to facilitate communication between Ticonderoga and Mount Independence.

Command at Ticonderoga went through a variety of changes early in 1777. Until 1777, General Philip Schuyler had headed the Continental Army&#x27;s Northern Department, with General Horatio Gates in charge of Ticonderoga. In March 1777 the Continental Congress gave command of the whole department to Gates. Schuyler protested this action, which Congress reversed in May, at which point Gates, no longer willing to serve under Schuyler, left for Philadelphia. Command of the fort was then given to General Arthur St. Clair, who arrived only three weeks before Burgoyne&#x27;s army.

The entire complex was manned by several under-strength regiments of the Continental Army and militia units from New York and nearby states. A war council held by Generals St. Clair and Schuyler on 20 June concluded that &quot;the number of troops now at this post, which are under 2,500 effectives, rank and file, are greatly inadequate to the defense&quot;, and that &quot;it is prudent to provide for a retreat&quot;. Consequently, plans were made for retreat along two routes. The first was by water to Skenesboro, the southernmost navigable point on the lake. The second was overland by a rough road leading east toward Hubbardton in the New Hampshire Grants (present-day Vermont).

The American force only consisted of two regiments, three composite units, and other undermanned corps; Francis&#x27; and Marshall&#x27;s Massachusetts Regiments, and Hale&#x27;s, Cilley&#x27;s and Scammell&#x27;s New Hampshire Continentals.
===Sugar Loaf===
A height called Sugar Loaf (now known as Mount Defiance) overlooked both Ticonderoga and Independence, and large cannons on that height would make the fort impossible to defend. This tactical problem had been pointed out by John Trumbull when Gates was in command. It was believed to be impossible for the British to place cannons on the heights, even though Trumbull, Anthony Wayne, and an injured Benedict Arnold climbed to the top and noted that gun carriages could probably be dragged up.

The defence, or lack thereof, of Sugar Loaf was complicated by the widespread perception that Fort Ticonderoga, with a reputation as the &quot;Gibraltar of the North&quot;, &quot;had&quot; to be held. Neither abandoning the fort nor garrisoning it with a small force (sufficient to respond to a feint but not to an attack in strength) was viewed as a politically viable option. Defending the fort and the associated outer works would require all the troops currently there, leaving none to defend Sugar Loaf. Furthermore, George Washington and the Congress were of the opinion that Burgoyne, who was known to be in Quebec, was more likely to strike from the south, moving his troops by sea to New York City.

Following the war council of 20 June, Schuyler ordered St. Clair to hold out as long as he could, and to avoid having his avenues of retreat cut off. Schuyler took command of a reserve force of 700 at Albany, and Washington ordered four regiments to be held in readiness at Peekskill, further down the Hudson River.

==Battle==
===British advance===
On 1 July, General St. Clair was still unaware of the full strength of Burgoyne&#x27;s army, which lay just away. Burgoyne had deployed Fraser&#x27;s advance force and right column on the west side of the lake, hoping to cut off the defenses at Mount Hope. Riedesel and the German column were deployed on the east side of the lake, where their objective was Mount Independence and the road to Hubbardton. Burgoyne gave the order to advance on 2 July.

On the morning of 2 July, St. Clair decided to withdraw the men occupying the defence post at Mount Hope, which was exposed and subject to capture. The detachment there set fire to the works and retreated to the old French lines (so-called because they were the site of the French defence in the 1758 Battle of Carillon), getting away not long before the arrival of Burgoyne&#x27;s advance guard. That afternoon, a company of British soldiers and Indians came toward those lines, but not near enough to do significant damage, and opened fire. St. Clair ordered his men to hold their fire until the enemy was closer, but James Wilkinson fired at a British soldier, spurring the untrained defenders to follow suit. The soldier Wilkinson fired at fell, and the British troops fled. When the man was captured, it turned out he was uninjured, and that he had fallen down because he was drunk. Through the deception of placing him with a man posing as a captured Loyalist, St. Clair learned the nature of the opposing forces.

Fraser&#x27;s advance forces occupied Mount Hope on 3 July. Burgoyne ordered some of the scouts and Indians over to the east side of the lake for reconnaissance ahead of the German column, and brought some of the Germans over to the west side. Some of the British camp was placed close enough to the American lines that they were harassed by gunfire. This did not prevent the British from making repairs to the bridges on the portage road between Ticonderoga and Lake George.

British engineers discovered the strategic position of Sugar Loaf, and realized that the American withdrawal from Mount Hope gave them access to it. Starting on 2 July, they began clearing and building gun emplacements on top of that height, working carefully to avoid notice by the Americans. They spent several days drawing some of their larger guns up the slope. Burgoyne&#x27;s objective was to spring the trap only when Riedesel&#x27;s Germans were in position to cut off the American retreat.

===American retreat===
On 4 July, the Americans held a quiet celebration with some toasts to commemorate the previous year&#x27;s Declaration of Independence. That night the British lost their element of surprise when some Indians lit fires on Sugar Loaf, alerting the Americans to their presence there. On the morning of 5 July, St. Clair held a war council in which the decision was made to retreat. Since their position was completely exposed, they delayed departure until nightfall, when their movements would be concealed. In a conversation with one of his quartermasters, St. Clair observed that he could &quot;save his character and lose the army&quot; by holding the fort, or &quot;save the army and lose his character&quot; if he retreated, giving a clear indication of the political reaction he was expecting to his decision.

All possible armaments, as well as invalids, camp followers, and supplies were loaded onto a fleet of more than 200 boats that began to move up the lake toward Skenesboro, accompanied by Colonel Pierse Long&#x27;s regiment. Owing to a shortage of boats, four invalids were left behind, as were the very largest cannons and a variety of supplies—everything from tents to cattle. The rest of the army crossed to Mount Independence and headed down the Hubbardton road, which Riedesel&#x27;s forces had not yet reached. A handful of men were left at the pontoon bridge with loaded cannons to fire on British attempts to cross it, but they were drunk when the British arrived the next morning.

The British occupied the forts without firing a single shot, and detachments from Fraser&#x27;s and Riedesel&#x27;s troops set out in pursuit of the retreating Americans on the Hubbardton road, while Burgoyne hurried some of his troops up the lake toward Skenesboro.

==Aftermath==

At least seven Americans were killed and 11 wounded in skirmishing prior to the American retreat. British casualties were not tallied, but at least five were killed in skirmishes.

The Americans made good time on the Hubbardton road. Most of the force reached Castleton—a march of —on the evening of 6 July. The British pursuit resulted in the Battle of Hubbardton when they caught up with the rear guard on the morning of 7 July, but this enabled the main American body to escape, eventually joining forces with Schuyler at Fort Edward. The smaller American force that had fled by boat to Skenesboro fought off Burgoyne&#x27;s advance force in the Battle of Fort Anne, but was forced to abandon equipment and many sick and wounded in skirmishing at Skenesboro.

The confrontation at Ticonderoga did not substantially slow Burgoyne&#x27;s advance, but he was forced to leave a garrison of more than 900 men in the Ticonderoga area, and wait until 11 July for the dispersed elements of his army to regroup at Skenesboro. He then encountered delays in traveling the heavily wooded road between Skenesboro and Fort Edward, which General Schuyler&#x27;s forces had effectively ruined by felling trees across it and destroying all its bridges in the swampy terrain. Burgoyne&#x27;s campaign ultimately failed and he was forced to surrender after the Battles of Saratoga. General Gates reported to Governor George Clinton on 20 November that Ticonderoga and Independence had been abandoned and burned by the retreating British.

===Political and public outcry===

The political and public outcry after the withdrawal was significant. The Congress was appalled, and criticized both Schuyler and St. Clair for the loss. John Adams wrote, &quot;I think we shall never be able to defend a post until we shoot a general&quot;, and George Washington said it was &quot;an event of chagrin and surprise, not apprehended nor within the compass of my reasoning&quot;. Rumors circulated that St. Clair and Schuyler were traitors who had taken bribes in exchange for the retreat.

Schuyler was eventually removed as commander of the Northern Department, replaced by General Gates; the fall of Ticonderoga was among the reasons cited. St. Clair was removed from his command and sent to headquarters for an inquiry. He maintained that his conduct had been honorable, and demanded a review by court martial. The court martial was not held until September 1778 due to political intrigues against Washington; St. Clair was completely exonerated, although he was never given another field command. Schuyler was also cleared of any wrongdoing by a court martial.

The news made headlines in Europe. King George is reported to have burst into the chambers of the scantily clad Queen, exclaiming, &quot;I have beat them! I have beat all the Americans!&quot; The French and Spanish courts were less happy with the news, as they had been supporting the Americans, allowing them to use their ports, and engaging in trade with them. The action emboldened the British to demand that Spain and France close their ports to the Americans; this demand was rejected, heightening tensions among the European powers.

==In popular culture==
Fort Ticonderoga in 1777, the siege and the aftermath, including the ordeal of escaping civilians and escaping--and pursuing--troops provide the setting for key portions of Diana Gabaldon&#x27;s &quot;An Echo in the Bone&quot;, the seventh book in her &quot;Outlander&quot; series of historical fantasy novels.

<text>Gérard Brach (23 July 1927 – 9 September 2006) was a French screenwriter best known for his collaborations with the film directors Roman Polanski and Jean-Jacques Annaud. He directed two movies: &quot;La Maison&quot; and &quot;Le Bateau sur l&#x27;herbe&quot;.

== Biography ==
Brach was born in Montrouge, Paris, where he grew up in poverty. At the age of 16, he was persuaded by his family to enlist in the Charlemagne division of the Waffen-SS, reportedly witnessing action at the Battle of Königsberg towards the end of World War II. After the war, he contracted tuberculosis and ended up spending five years in a sanatorium, undergoing a series of operations that left him with only one lung. While a patient at the sanatorium he befriended the Dadaist poet Benjamin Péret, who introduced him to André Breton, author of the &quot;Surrealist Manifesto&quot; and a major influence on Brach&#x27;s early work.

By the late 1950s Brach had entered the film industry, undertaking a number of roles – from acting in minor parts on several films to working as a runner for the producer Pierre Roustang. The poverty he experienced at this time was such that he often let himself be locked in production offices at night so he could have a place to sleep; to kill his hunger, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; later reported, he &quot;ate baguettes laced with vinegar&quot;. From 1959 to 1962 he was employed as a publicist for Twentieth-Century Fox.

In 1959, Brach met Roman Polanski for the first time while working abroad in Poland, and began collaborating with him on a number of different projects. Both men later moved to London, where they wrote the scripts for &quot;Repulsion&quot; and &quot;Cul-de-Sac&quot; in short order. Brach remained in Britain for several years before returning to France to helm &quot;La Maison&quot; (1970), his first attempt at film direction. A year later he directed &quot;Le Bateau sur l’herbe&quot;, which starred Jean-Pierre Cassel and was nominated for the Grand Prix and the Prix du Jury at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival. Neither film made much impact at the box office. He had further success, however, with his screenplays, working alongside directors of international renown such as Jean-Jacques Annaud, Michelangelo Antonioni, Andrei Konchalovsky and Bertrand Blier.

In later years Brach suffered from intense agoraphobia, which prevented him from leaving his Paris apartment. His illness, he claimed in an interview, arrived &quot;like a black cloud out of nowhere in the early 1980s&quot;, making him &quot;break out in a cold sweat, shake and freeze in panic&quot; as soon as he stepped outside. He received treatment for his affliction, but never managed to defeat it completely.

== Personal life and death ==
Brach was married twice. His first wife, with whom he had a son, divorced him in 1955. He met his second wife, Elisabeth, in 1969; they wed in Brach&#x27;s bedroom eleven years later, as by this time his agoraphobia was too severe for him to marry in public. He died of heart failure on 9 September 2006 in Paris, aged 79.

<text>The Beryciformes are a poorly-understood order of carnivorous ray-finned fishes consisting of 7 families, 30 genera, and 161 species. They feed on small fish and invertebrates. Beyond this, little is known about the biology of most member species because of their nocturnal habits and deepwater habitats. All beryciform species are marine and most live in tropical to temperate, deepwater environments. Most live on the continental shelf and continental slope, with some species being found as deep as . Some species move closer to the surface at night, while others live entirely in shallow water and are nocturnal, hiding in rock crevices and caves during the day. Several species are mesopelagic and bathypelagic. Beryciformes&#x27; bodies are deep and mildly compressed, typically with large eyes that help them see in darker waters. Colors range from red to yellow and brown to black, and sizes range from . Member genera include the alfonsinos, squirrelfishes, flashlight fishes, fangtooth fishes, spinyfins, pineconefishes, redfishes, roughies, and slimeheads. A number of member species are caught commercially, including the alfonsino, the splendid alfonsino, and the orange roughy, the latter being much more economically important. Some species have bioluminescent bacteria contained in pockets of skin or in light organs near the eyes, including the anomalopids and monocentrids.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==

Beryciforms first appeared during the Late Cretaceous period and have survived to today in relative abundance. They are considered the most primitive order in Acanthopterygii, and as such are split off at the base of the cladogram below from the rest of the member orders. Beryciforms are distinguished by having 18–19 caudal fin rays, as opposed to percomorphs, which have 17. Having fewer caudal fin rays is considered a sign of a more recently evolved species among fish. The whalefishes, beardfishes, gibberfishes, and pricklefishes were once considered members of Beryciformes, but have since been assigned to separate orders.

A recent phylogeny based on the work Betancur-Rodriguez &quot;et al.&quot; 2017. The Gibberichthyidae (gibberfishes) and Hispidoberycidae (spiny-scale pricklefish) of suborder Stephanoberycoidei were not examined.
==Older classification==
The order contains 7 families, 30 genera, and 161 species:

* Order Beryciformes
** Suborder Berycoidei
*** Berycidae (alfonsinos, nannygais)
** Suborder Holocentroidei
*** Holocentridae (soldierfishes, squirrelfishes)
** Suborder Trachichthyoidei
*** Anomalopidae (flashlight fishes, lanterneye fishes)
*** Diretmidae (spinyfins)
*** Monocentridae (pineconefishes, pineapple fishes)
*** Trachichthyidae (incl. Anoplogastridae)(slimeheads, redfishes, roughies, fangtooth fishes)
* Order Cetomimiformes
** Family Rondeletiidae (redmouth whalefishes)
** Family Barbourisiidae (red/velvet whalefishes)
** Family Cetomimidae (flabby whalefishes)
* Order Stephanoberyciformes
** Family Melamphaidae (bigscale fishes)
** Family Gibberichthyidae (gibberfishes)
** Family Hispidoberycidae (Spiny-scale pricklefishes)
** Family Stephanoberycidae (pricklefishes)

==Human interaction==
The Beryciformes are generally not important to humans, and their trend towards living in deeper waters generally keeps many species away from human activity. Several species are found in the aquarium trade, however. Pineapplefishes are of interest to fishkeepers for their bright colors, while squirrelfishes&#x27; shallower reef habitats and bright red colors make them more easily collected. Flashlight fishes are also kept as pets because of the bioluminescent organs underneath their eyes. The alfonsinos and orange roughy are of a different interest to humans, targeted by deepwater commercial fisheries. Increased catches could lead to steep population declines for these species as their extended lifespans make them vulnerable to overfishing. The orange roughy, for example, can live up to 149 years, but takes anywhere from 23 to 40 years to begin reproducing. Despite these risks, most of the species that have been evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) are listed as Least Concern or Data Deficient; only a few are classified as Vulnerable.

==Timeline of genera==
The Beryciformes first appeared in the Late Cretaceous and still survive today in relative abundance.

<doc id="448135" wikidata="Q875120" url="?curid=448135" title="SC Cambuur">
<text>SC Cambuur, also known as Cambuur Leeuwarden, or simply Cambuur, () is a Dutch professional football club from the city of Leeuwarden formed on 19 June 1964. They currently play in the Eerste Divisie, the second tier of Dutch football, following relegation from the Eredivisie in the 2022–23 season. The home ground of the club is the 15,000-capacity Kooi Stadion, which opened in 2024. The club usually plays in yellow shirts and blue shorts. The origin of the club&#x27;s emblem is the coat of arms of the House of Cammingha, a Frisian noble family. Their main rivals are SC Heerenveen.

==History==

Founded in 1964, Cambuur has played a total of seven seasons in the top-flight Eredivisie. In the 1980s and 1990s, the club was a regular contender in the Eerste Divisie playoffs. Cambuur won the Eerste Divisie title in 1992 and gained promotion to the Eredivisie, but was relegated two seasons later in 1994. In 1998, the club was promoted again to the Eredivisie, but again was relegated after just two years in the top-flight in 2000. Troubled times followed which brought the &quot;folk club&quot; close to bankruptcy in 2005. The rebuilding started in 2006 and since 2010, the club has been in a relatively stable financial condition.

In 2009, the club almost won the playoff against Eredivisie side Roda JC, only losing on penalties. In 2010, the club came in second, again just narrowly missing promotion. Cambuur welcomed during these play-offs more than 40,000 spectators in just two weeks. Another estimated 7,000 fans watched the final play-off match against Roda on a large screen in the city centre of the city of Leeuwarden. More than 1.4 million people watched the final play-off match on television, which appeared to be another record for a play-off promotion match in the Netherlands. In total, more than 4.5 million people watched the play-off matches between Cambuur, PEC Zwolle and Roda JC on television that year.

Cambuur won the Eerste Divisie championship in the 2012–13 season, awarding the club promotion to the Eredivisie for the 2013–14 season. On 1 May 2016, Cambuur were relegated to the Eerste Divisie after losing 6–2 away to PSV.

Cambuur were denied promotion to the 2020–21 Eredivisie as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite being in first place of the 2019–20 Eerste Divisie.

Cambuur won the 2020-21 Eerste Divisie to return to the Eredivisie. In the 2021-2022 Eredivisie season they would finish in 9th place, a record high for the club. The 2022-23 season went terribly for the club, and on the 6th of May 2023 the club would be relegated back to the Eerste Divisie following a 3–0 loss away to FC Utrecht.

==Supporters==
Cambuur has a group of ultras, known as the M.I.-Side, who stand on the north and south stands at the Cambuur Stadion. The name derives from the street names in which the stands are built: &quot;M&quot; stands for Marathonstraat and &quot;I&quot; for Insulindestraat. Most of the hardcore fans of Cambuur are sitting close to the stand of the away fans on the northern side of the stadium. They are among the most notorious in the Netherlands. In the 2009–10 season, the average attendance was 8,600 fans per game, and more than 6,500 season tickets were sold. That was a new record for Cambuur, as these numbers were achieved while the club was in the second division but even higher than when it played in the Eredivisie. In the 2009–10 season, the club sold out six regular season matches with 10,000 fans per game, another milestone for the Leeuwarden-based club. Never before in the second division it had sold out that many regular season matches.

<text>The Scarpe () is a river in the Hauts-de-France region of France. It is a is long left-bank tributary of the river Escaut (Scheldt). The source of the river is at Berles-Monchel near Aubigny-en-Artois. It flows through the towns of Arras, Douai and Saint-Amand-les-Eaux. The river ends at Mortagne-du-Nord, where it flows into the Scheldt. Scarpe Mountain in Alberta, Canada, was named after the river. The navigable waterway and its coal barges also feature in the novels by 19th century author Émile Zola.

== Navigation ==

The river was made navigable by 15 weirs and locks over about two thirds of its length (), divided into the Upper Scarpe (, 23 km, 9 locks) from Arras to Courchelettes, the Middle Scarpe through Douai, and the Lower Scarpe (, 36 km, 6 locks) from Douai to the Escaut. The Middle Scarpe is no longer navigable, bypassed by the high-capacity Canal Dunkerque-Escaut.

== History ==
This river was navigated from the Escaut up to Douai as early as 638, but improvements with flash locks were required to give access to the important town of Arras, reached in 1613. This remained a shallow navigation, with locks of varying width and length, until it was improved to the Becquey gauge in the 1840s. The enlargement to Freycinet gauge was completed by about 1890. Today the Lower Scarpe is closed from the Douai junction to Saint-Amand-les-Eaux pending dredging and identification of a new owner and operator.

The river and its valley were important battlegrounds in the Battle of the Scarpe in the First World War. The valley of the Scarpe has been designated as a protected Ramsar site since 2020.

<text>Iran is subdivided into thirty-one provinces ( &quot;ostân&quot;), each governed from a local centre, usually the largest local city, which is called the capital (Persian: , &quot;markaz&quot;) of that province. The provincial authority is headed by a governor-general (Persian: &quot;ostândâr&quot;), who is appointed by the Minister of the Interior subject to approval of the cabinet.

== Modern history ==
Iran has held its modern territory since the Treaty of Paris in 1857. Prior to 1937, Iran had maintained its feudal administrative divisional structure, dating back to the time the modern state was centralized by the Safavid dynasty in the 16th century. Although the boundaries, roles, and rulers changed often. On the eve of the Persian Constitutional Revolution in 1905, Iran was composed of Tehran, being directly ruled by the monarch; four &quot;eyalats&quot; ( &quot;elâyât&quot; pl., &quot;elayat&quot; sin.), ruled by Qajar princes; and various &quot;velayats&quot; ( &quot;velâyât&quot; pl., &quot;velayat&quot; sin.). Nomadic tribal confederations, such as the Bakhtiari people and Qashqai people, were largely independent of the domestic administrative divisions and were autonomous.

With the Constitutional Revolution, and the formation of the first National Consultative Assembly, Iran&#x27;s administrative subdivisions were legally defined in 1907. Any change in the boundaries of &quot;eyalats&quot;, &quot;velayats&quot;, or their respective sub-districts was banned as per the Iranian constitution, except with the passage of a new law by the assembly. As per the 1907 law, the following were defined:

On 22 October 1911, Iranian National Consultative Assembly passed another law, titled &quot;The law of Election of National Consultative Assembly&quot; (). This law presented a complete list of all &quot;Eyalats&quot; and &quot;Velayats&quot; of the country, as well as their constituent districts and cities. This list presented the grouping of various towns and districts into electoral districts for the purpose of the election. According to this law, in 1911, Iran was made up of 27 administrative subdivisions, the region of Tehran, 4 &quot;eyalats&quot;, and 22 &quot;velayats&quot;. Below is a list:

In 1937, Iran was reorganized to form ten numbered provinces with subordinate governorates: Gilan, Mazandaran, East Azerbaijan, West Azerbaijan, Kermanshah, Khuzestan, Fars, Kerman, Khorasan, and Isfahan.

Iran has had a historical claim to Bahrain as its 14th province: Bahrain province, which was under British colonial occupation until 1971. Prior to 1957, Bahrain was placed under Fars province. During Safavid Iran, Bahrain was subordinate to Bushehr governorship and Zubarah (located in modern-day country of Qatar) was its capital city. In 1737, under Afsharid dynasty Bahrain was made subject to Fars governorship. This claim was reasserted by the new theocratic Iranian leadership after 1979 with the famous 1981 coup attempt that occurred.

From 1960 to 1981, the governorates were gradually raised to provincial status one by one. Since then several new provinces have been created, most recently in 2010 when the new Alborz province was split from Tehran province, and before that in 2004 when the province of Khorasan was divided into three provinces.
==Information==

==Current provinces==

According to &quot;Donya-e-Eqtesad&quot;, between 2017 and 2019, some 11 of the 20 poorest Iranian cities were in the province of Sistan and Baluchestan. Three other markedly poor cities were located in Kerman province.


==Provincial abbreviations==

Table below shows the provinces&#x27; abbreviation, which can be used in postal addresses and academic affiliations for the sake of simplicity.

==Historical provinces==

<text>Ivan &quot;Ivo&quot; Visin (3 November 1806 – 17 August 1868) was a naval captain of the Austro-Hungarian Navy and an explorer.

==Biography==
Visin was born in Prčanj, then under the occupation of the French Empire. At the request of the government of the Habsburg monarchy, he became the first Croat to circumnavigate the globe in a vessel called &quot;Splendido&quot; between 1852 and 1859. The journey started in Antwerp and ended successfully in Trieste. The ship was 30 m long with 311 tonnes of cargo. For this undertaking of historical importance for the empire, he had been decorated with a flag of honour &quot;Merito navali&quot; by the Austrian Emperor Franz Josef. The trophy is on display in Birth of Our Lady church in Prčanj. Later, Visin became an honorary citizen of Trieste.

<doc id="448166" wikidata="Q775807" url="?curid=448166" title="Half-elf">
<text>A half-elf is a mythological or fictional being, the offspring of an immortal elf and a mortal man. They are often depicted as very beautiful and endowed with magical powers; they may be presented as torn between the two worlds that they inhabit. Half-elves became known in modern times mainly through J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth writings but have origins in Norse mythology. A half-elf appeared in Lord Dunsany&#x27;s 1924 book &quot;The King of Elfland&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

In Middle-earth, half-elves are the children of Elves and Men, and can choose either Elvish immortality or the mortal life of Men. The elf-maidens Lúthien and Arwen in Tolkien&#x27;s works both chose mortality to be with the Men that they loved. Scholars have noted that this enabled Tolkien to explore several key themes, including love and death, time and immortality. As a Catholic, he believed that Men, freely choosing to let go, gain release from the world&#x27;s limitations; whereas if they tried to hold on to life and material things, they would end in darkness. His Elves – except for half-elves – were unable to gain this release. In &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; Tolkien wrote that since men write fairy-stories, these concern the escape from death; and conversely that Elves would tell human-stories about the escape from deathlessness. Since their popularisation by Tolkien, half-elves have become widely-known in role-playing games, and in turn in video games and spin-off films. The role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; features its own race of half-elves, including the character &quot;Tanis Half-Elven&quot;.

== Norse mythology ==

In Norse mythology, a half-elf is the offspring of an elf and a human. Major examples include Skuld and Högni. Högni was a hero in &quot;Thidreks saga&quot;, born to a human queen when an elf visited her while the king was away. Skuld was a Danish princess, as told in &quot;Hrólf Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;. King Helgi, sleeping alone as he had not been invited to King Adils&#x27;s wedding, let in a ragged person on a midwinter night. As she slept, he saw she was a radiantly beautiful woman dressed in a silk gown. She told him he had freed her from a curse and asked to leave. He asked her to stay and marry him, and she agreed. They slept together. She told him they would have a child, and asked him to visit the child the next winter at the harbour. The King forgot to do so, but three years later the woman, an elf, returned and left a daughter at his door. She told him that the child&#x27;s name was Skuld, which means &quot;what you should do&quot;. She said that the King would gain the reward for breaking the curse, but that the King&#x27;s people would suffer as the King had not done as she had asked. She never came back, but Skuld was always angry.

The scholar Hilda Ellis describes Skuld as evil, recalling that in the saga, Skuld used magic to raise an army against Hrólf, her half-brother. As quickly as Hrólf&#x27;s warriors kill Skuld&#x27;s men, they spring up, fighting more strongly than ever. Leading the fight for Hrólf, Bodvar Bjarki calls Skuld&#x27;s men &quot;draugar&quot;, &#x27;undead&#x27;, saying &quot;they are grimmest to deal with after they are dead, and against this we have no power.&quot; Ellis comments that Skuld is one of the Norse women involved in &quot;everlasting battle&quot; who share the names of Valkyries, females who guide the souls of the dead. She notes that Skuld is &quot;said to be the child of an elf-woman&quot;, but that it is difficult &quot;to decide how accurately the term [elves] is used&quot;, as its meaning shifts between the sagas and the &quot;Edda&quot; poems.

Högni too is &quot;essentially a demonic character&quot;, his name connected to the German &quot;Hexe&quot;, &#x27;witch&#x27;, and to the English &quot;hag&quot;; the scholar Alexander Krappe sees his being the son of an elf as fitting in to that role, while his daughter Hildegund similarly has &quot;certain magical qualities&quot;, such as awakening fallen warriors.

== Lord Dunsany ==

Perhaps the earliest published half-elf in modern literature is the character Orion in Lord Dunsany&#x27;s 1924 &quot;The King of Elfland&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. The lord of Erl sends his son, Alveric, to fetch the King of Elfland&#x27;s daughter, Lirazel, as his bride; the couple have a son, Orion. Lirazel, pining for Elfland, returns there. Alveric and his father search for her helplessly. Lirazel now longs for her mortal husband and half-elven son. The King of Elfland changes Erl into a part of Elfland, and the family live forever in a timeless realm.

In 1977, two members of the folk rock band Steeleye Span (Bob Johnson and Pete Knight) created a concept album also named &quot;The King of Elfland&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, inspired by Lord Dunsany&#x27;s book. Christopher Lee appears as the narrator and the King of Elfland.

== Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth ==

In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth, the &quot;Half-elven&quot; (Sindarin singular &quot;Peredhel&quot;, plural &quot;Peredhil&quot;, Quenya singular &quot;Perelda&quot;) are the children of the union of Elves and Men. Of these, the most significant were the products of couplings between the Eldar (the Elves who followed the Call to Valinor) and the Edain (the Men of the Three Houses of early Men who allied themselves with the Eldar in their war against Morgoth). Three recorded unions of the Edain and Eldar generated descendants: Idril and Tuor; Lúthien and Beren; and Arwen and Aragorn. The first two couples wed during the final part of the First Age of Middle-earth, while the third married at the end of the Third Age (some 6500 years later). The third couple descended not only from the first two couples, but also from the twins Elros and Elrond, who chose mankind and elvenkind respectively—thereby severing their fates and those of their descendants. In Appendix A of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, Tolkien notes that by the marriage of Arwen and Aragorn &quot;the long-sundered branches of the Half-elven were reunited and their line was restored&quot;. The second union was the only one of the three marriages in which the Elf involved (Idril) did not become mortal; instead Tuor was joined to the Elves. In all these cases, the husband was a mortal Man, while the wife was Elven.

=== Beren and Lúthien ===

The first of these was between the mortal Beren, of the House of Bëor, and Lúthien, daughter of the Elf Thingol, king of the Sindar, and Melian, a Maia. Beren died in the quest for the Silmaril, and in despair, Lúthien&#x27;s spirit departed her body and made its way to the halls of Mandos. Mandos allowed them a unique fate, and they were re-bodied as mortals in Middle-earth, where they dwelt until their second deaths. Their son Dior, heir of the Sindarin kingdom of Doriath and of the Silmaril, was thus one-quarter Elvish by blood and one-quarter Maian, and half-human. He was killed while still young, when the sons of Fëanor sacked Doriath. Dior&#x27;s wife was Nimloth, a Sindarin Elf, and with her he had three children, Elwing and two sons (thus, half-elven but not between Edain and Eldar, men and Elves of the highest blood).

=== Tuor and Idril ===

The second marriage of Men and Elves in the First Age was between Tuor of the House of Hador, another branch of the Edain, and Idril Celebrindal, an Elf, though half Noldorin and half Vanyarin in ancestry. Their son was Eärendil. After the fall of Gondolin, Eärendil also escaped to the Mouths of Sirion, and married Elwing who was also half-elven. They had twin sons, Elrond and Elros.

=== Aragorn and Arwen ===

Uniquely, Eärendil and Elwing, together with their sons Elrond and Elros, were granted their choice of fates: to be counted as Elves (free to dwell in the blessed Undying Lands for as long as Arda endures) or to be counted as Human (entitled to the Gift of Men whereby, through death, their spirits are freed to enter the unknown beyond Arda). Should this Choice not have been granted, they, like all other Half-Elves, would have been automatically mortal. Elros chose to be counted among mortals, and became Tar-Minyatur, the first king of Númenor. He finally took his death (for those kings had the freedom and grace to die at will) at the age of five hundred. The descendants of Elros were not given this choice, but their lifespan was several times that of ordinary Men. In later times the Númenórean kings, descendants of Elros, regretted their forefather&#x27;s choice, and this helped lead to the Downfall of Númenor. Elrond chose to be counted among the Elves, joining the court of Gil-galad until the end of the Second Age. He also founded Rivendell in the Second Age. He married the Elf Celebrían, daughter of Celeborn and Galadriel, and sailed into the West at the conclusion of the War of the Ring. The children of Elrond were also given choice of kindred, and therefore Arwen could choose to be counted among the Edain even though her father hoped she would accompany him to Elvenhome in the West. But she chose otherwise, marrying Aragorn II Elessar, king of the Reunited Kingdom, at the start of the Fourth Age, and bringing noble elvish blood into his dynasty. He ruled for 120 years, choosing to die at a great age for a man, but while still in full health. She died alone at the age of 2,901 years, grieving the brevity of her mortal happiness.

=== Line of the Half-elven in Middle-earth ===

=== Other lines ===

According to &quot;the tradition of [the] house&quot; mentioned in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the line of Princes of Dol Amroth originated from the union of Imrazôr the Númenórean, a Prince of Belfalas, and Mithrellas, a Silvan Elf and companion of Nimrodel, an Nandorin Elf from Lothlórien. They had two children: a boy Galador and a girl Gilmith, though it is said that Mithrellas later vanished in the night. Galador, according to this tradition, became the first Prince of Dol Amroth. Tolkien initially worked on a genealogical table linking Imrazôr&#x27;s children with Imrahil, but eventually abandoned it. The claim of elvish heritage figures in the perception of Prince Imrahil among the people of Minas Tirith, illustrated by the following line of dialogue: &quot;Belike the old tales speak well; there is Elvish blood in the veins of that folk, for the people of Nimrodel dwelt in that land once long ago&quot;. Legolas, an Elf of Mirkwood, believed as much about Prince Imrahil&#x27;s alleged heritage upon meeting him during the events of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. He remarked that &quot;long since the people of Nimrodel left the woodlands of Lórien, and yet still one may see that not all sailed from Amroth&#x27;s haven west over water&quot;, though the matter is probed no further.

In &quot;The Hobbit&quot; reference is made to a rumour among Hobbit folk that a Took ancestor of Bilbo Baggins had long ago taken a &quot;fairy&quot; (i.e. Elf) wife, but the allegation is immediately dismissed as a simplistic explanation for the sometimes atypical behaviour of the Took clan. Even if hobbits have some elvish blood, however, they are &quot;endearing rather than frightening&quot;, unlike other half-human hybrids such as Dracula.

In &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot; (published in two parts), the young Tolkien originally intended Eärendil, then spelled Earendel, to be the first of the Half-elven. Early versions of &quot;The Tale of Beren and Lúthien&quot; had Beren as an Elf. The earliest version of the tale of Túrin Turambar had Tamar, the character Tolkien later renamed Brandir, as a Half-elf; Tolkien mentioned this in a way that implied he did not consider Half-elven descent especially remarkable at the time he wrote that story.

=== Interpretations ===

The Tolkien scholar Richard C. West notes the resemblance between the half-elves Arwen and Lúthien, and analyses Arwen&#x27;s understanding of her fateful choice, between love for Aragorn and mortality on the one hand, and her father&#x27;s wishes and immortality on the other. West analyses the scene at the camp on Weathertop where Aragorn recounts to the hobbits in poetry and prose the tale of Beren and Lúthien, with West highlighting Aragorn&#x27;s words and &quot;pensive mood&quot; as he tells them that Lúthien &quot;chose mortality, and to die from the world, so that she might follow [Beren]&quot; and that &quot;together they passed, long ago, beyond the confines of this world&quot; and that she &quot;alone of the Elf-kindred has died indeed and left the world, and they have lost her whom they most loved&quot;. West speculates that Aragorn may be thinking here of the consequences of what will happen should Arwen marry him, and later states that he finds &quot;the lonely death of Arwen the most moving tragedy within [&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;]&quot;. A similar conclusion regarding Aragorn&#x27;s feelings at Weathertop is drawn by the scholar of medieval English literature John M. Bowers in his work on the influence of Geoffrey Chaucer on Tolkien. Bowers, looking at both the Weathertop scene and &#x27;The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&#x27;, states that like certain pilgrims in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, Aragorn&#x27;s stories of his ancestors &quot;open a window into his private desires and fears&quot;.

The scholar of English literature Anna Vaninskaya studies how Tolkien uses fantasy to examine the issues of love and death, time and immortality. Given that Tolkien&#x27;s Elves are immortal, they face the question of death from a unique vantage-point. Sarah Workman writes that in the &quot;Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&quot;, Arwen&#x27;s mourning of Aragorn serves to overcome what Peter Brooks called (she writes) the &quot;meaningless&quot;, interminable nature of immortality. Workman quotes Brooks&#x27;s statement that &quot;all narration is obituary&quot; and states that it is in that conception that Tolkien valued Arwen&#x27;s fate: it is Arwen&#x27;s &quot;mourning gaze that allows for the transmission of Aragorn&#x27;s memory&quot;, or in Tolkien&#x27;s words which she quotes, &quot;And long there he lay, an image of the splendour of the Kings of Men in glory undimmed&quot;.

Critics including the Polish scholar of religion in literature and film, Christopher Garbowski, note that while Tolkien contrasts Elves and Men throughout &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, he introduces the conceit that an Elf may marry a Man on condition of surrendering her immortality, something that happens exactly twice in Middle-earth: with Lúthien, and then with Arwen.

The scholar of English literature Catherine Madsen notes the reflection of mortality in the &quot;fading&quot; of Middle-earth from the enormous powers like Morgoth and Elbereth that battled in the First Age. She writes that &quot;Aragorn is a hero and a descendant of heroes, but he is brought up in hiding and given the name of Hope [Estel]; Arwen possesses the beauty of Lúthien, but she is born in the twilight of her people and her title is Evenstar; these two restore the original glories only for a little while, before the world is altered and &#x27;fades into the light of common day&#x27;&quot;. Rateliff, writing on the theme of the evocation of loss in Tolkien&#x27;s works, describes the &#x27;Gift of Men&#x27; as being &quot;to accept loss and decay as essential parts of the world&quot; and draws parallels with other writings by Tolkien: &quot;The Elves cling to the past and so are swept away with it; in a fallen world, acceptance of the inevitability of death is the only way to pass beyond the world&#x27;s limitations, for Brendan or Niggle or Arwen.&quot;

The medievalist Verlyn Flieger wrote that nobody knows where Men go to when they leave Middle-earth, and that the nearest Tolkien came to dealing with the question was in his essay &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; &quot;where, after speculating that since &#x27;fairy-stories are made by men not by fairies&#x27;, they must deal with what he called the Great Escape, the escape from death. He went on to the singular assertion that &#x27;the Human-stories of the elves are doubtless full of the Escape from Deathlessness&#x27;.&quot; Flieger suggests that two of the &quot;human stories&quot; of Tolkien&#x27;s Elves really focus on this kind of escape, the &quot;Tale of Beren and Lúthien&quot; and the &quot;Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&quot;, where in both cases a half-elf makes her escape from deathlessness. Shippey comments that &quot;the themes of the Escape from Death, and the Escape from Deathlessness, are vital parts of Tolkien&#x27;s entire mythology.&quot; In a 1968 broadcast on BBC2, Tolkien quoted French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir and described the inevitability of death as the &quot;key-spring of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;&quot;. In their annotated and expanded edition of Tolkien&#x27;s essay (&quot;Tolkien On Fairy-stories&quot;), Flieger and textual scholar Douglas A. Anderson provide commentary on &#x27;the Escape from Deathlessness&#x27; passage, referencing Tolkien&#x27;s views in a 1956 letter, that:

Flieger remarks further that by attaching herself to men&#x27;s lives and deaths, Lúthien is running against the current of elven life, but at the same time, by undergoing death and darkness Beren and she manage to come to the light. What is more, Flieger writes, their union creates a new race, the half-elven, who have the privilege of choosing either fate, and &quot;new hope for both races&quot;. She notes that Tolkien described the story as &quot;Release from Bondage&quot;, meaning death, release from deathlessness, and explains &quot;Through death, men can let go; in their deathlessness, elves cannot. The half-elven can also be released from bondage, freed from the earth, if they wish. Tolkien makes no promises; what&#x27;s to come is still unsure.&quot; In her view, this is the Catholic Tolkien&#x27;s key point, that being able to let go means trusting in faith. Holding on to life, or to physical treasures like the Silmaril which gets Thingol killed, is &quot;folly&quot;. Thingol was in the light of the Two Trees, but by grasping Middle-earth, Lúthien, and finally the Silmaril, he journeys into and ends in darkness. It is the opposite of Lúthien&#x27;s journey.

== In role-playing games ==

Both Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1954) and Dunsany&#x27;s &quot;The King of Elfland&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1924) greatly increased popular awareness of half-elves. As a result, half-elves have become common in other fantasy writings and role-playing games, the best-known being the 1974 &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Half-elves are also featured in the role-playing game &quot;Pathfinder&quot;.

=== Dungeons &amp; Dragons ===

&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; has featured its own race of half-elves as a player character option in multiple editions of the game. Josh Williams of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; stated that &quot;half-elves are popular because they&#x27;re a great choice for those wanting to play as a fantasy race without stepping too far away from humanity&quot;. Williams commented that &quot;half-elves struggle to fit in&quot; when growing up but &quot;thanks to being born of two worlds, half-elves are perfect for players wishing to be the charismatic diplomat of the group&quot;. Gus Wezerek, for &quot;FiveThirtyEight,&quot; reported that of the 5th Edition &quot;class and race combinations per 100,000 characters that players created on D&amp;D Beyond from&quot; August 15 to September 15, 2017, half-elves were the third most created at 10,454 total, preceded by elves (16,443) and humans (25,248). The three most popular class combinations with the half-elf were bard (1,808), warlock (1,401) and rogue (1,325). Wezerek noted &quot;some of the common character choices can be explained by the game&#x27;s structure of racial bonuses&quot;. Matthew Byrd, for &quot;Den of Geek&quot; in 2023, also highlighted that half-elves have &quot;stats/attributes&quot; reflective of two races which offer &quot;some unique role-playing options&quot; and that mechanically the race has &quot;benefited from a pretty generous base stat distribution and useful base skills&quot;. However, the terminology and the way in which the game structures inherited mechanical traits for characters with mixed ancestry, such as half-elves, has been criticised. As a result, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; is moving away from having the half-elf as a distinct race in the game and it is not listed in the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2024) as a character option.

A well-known character from &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fiction is Tanis Half-Elven. Tanis is a player character in the spin-off 1988 video game &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Heroes of the Lance&quot;. He is a miniature lead figure in Ral Partha&#x27;s &quot;Dragonlance Heroes&quot; boxed figures set, described by a critic as &quot;Tanis is dressed as a typical ranger in leathers and fur-lined shirt and boots. The vest has a design worked into it, as does his dagger scabbard. The belt has a pouch attached. Tanis&#x27;s face is finely chiseled with a neatly groomed beard, although he appears gaunt. His left hand clutches his bow.&quot; Tanis is played by Michael Rosenbaum in the 2008 animated film &quot;&quot;. Tanis, like all &quot;Dragonlance&quot; heroes, is a flawed character; Lauren Davis of &quot;io9&quot; comments that he is &quot;consumed by his inability to fit completely into either the human or elven worlds&quot;. Rob Bricken, also of &quot;io9&quot;, writes that Tanis is &quot;A bastard (in the technical sense) half-elf who doesn&#x27;t truly belong in the world of either race; he&#x27;s a capable leader of the group although he&#x27;s often plagued by self-doubt. He left Qualinesti, a land of elves, because their leader&#x27;s daughter Laurana was in love with him and her father was having none of it. He&#x27;s currently in love with a swordswoman named Kitiara, who&#x27;s the half-sister of Caramon and Raistlin.&quot;

<text>Decoys is a 2004 Canadian science fiction horror film directed by Matthew Hastings and written by Tom Berry and Hastings. The cast included Kim Poirier and Nicole Eggert. It was filmed in Ottawa, Ontario and originally broadcast on the Sci Fi Channel. A sequel, &quot;Decoys 2: Alien Seduction&quot;, was released in 2007.

==Plot==
A jock sneaks into his supposed girlfriend&#x27;s house with flowers for her. It is cold inside and when he approaches his girlfriend&#x27;s room he finds a dead man with his mouth wide open. He then spots two more corpses.

Elsewhere, Luke Callahan and Roger, two college freshmen and virgins, are desperate to get laid. While doing their laundry after drinking too much beer, Luke meets two seductive girls named Lily and Constance. When Lily deliberately leaves a roll of quarters in the laundry, an inebriated and horny Luke goes to return them to her. He finds her room is unlocked and he decides to sneak in, finding that it is very cold inside. But when the girls suddenly return, he decides to hide in the closet. Luke watches as the girls open the windows and let the cold winter air surround them, seemingly arousing and comforting them as they strip naked, much to Luke&#x27;s amusement. He then watches in horror and confusion as reptilian tentacles unfold from their chests and sexually arouse them while Constance sprays Lily down with a can of liquid nitrogen. Luke, horrified and intrigued, decides to get to the bottom of the mystery.

Meanwhile, the police find the body of a young man named Bobby from the college, frozen from the inside out and his mouth wide open with a look of terror on his face. He oddly also has a noticeable erection. The forensic scientists assume a &quot;keg drinking tube&quot; was shoved down his throat, not realizing it was actually Lily, who shoved her alien tentacle down his throat while having sex with him. Luke, with his girlfriend Alex, decides to try to find out what these aliens are and if needed, exterminate them.

Luke and Roger&#x27;s friend Gibby wanders into a cemetery with his girlfriend Natasha. They enter a mausoleum and begin to have sex on a cement slab. As Gibby ejaculates, Natasha reveals that she is an alien as her tentacles emerge from her chest and immobilize Gibby. a toothy ovipositor tentacle unfolds and is shoved down his throat as part of the alien mating process. After completing the mating process, Gibby freezes solid and dies, thus not surviving the mating process, much to Natasha&#x27;s disappointment.

In an effort to catch the aliens in the act and prove their existence, Luke and Alex hatch a plan to record them. Luke plants a camera in his bedroom and manages to get a very-horny Lily to go to bed with him. While Alex watches from a different room, Luke and Lily disrobe and prepare to have sex. As Lily mounts him, Luke notices a strange green organ between her breasts. The camera suddenly malfunctions, and Lily realizes she&#x27;s being recorded. Angered, Lily prepares to rape Luke to death and unleashes her tentacles but accidentally knocks over a candle, which starts a fire. Seemingly vulnerable to the heat, Lily screams and sheds her human form, letting Luke see what the aliens look like in their true form; humanoid reptilians. Lily escapes, but Luke and Alex fail to capture any evidence.

Constance, meanwhile, becomes emotionally engaged with Roger, explains to him that the aliens have come to Earth to impregnate men, as their race is dying out. To save their people, the aliens persuade men to come with them, promising sex. However, the &quot;mating&quot; process involves sticking their tentacles down the male&#x27;s throat. Most men die because they cannot survive the cold temperature. Roger allows Constance to &quot;mate&quot; with him after she explains everything as she has fallen in love with him when she wasn&#x27;t supposed to. She explains that they&#x27;re merely trying to survive and that they don&#x27;t want anyone to die. He agrees to allow her to impregnate him, giving her race a chance to survive. Luke comes in just in time to see an alien crawl out of Roger&#x27;s mouth. Roger dies soon after, leaving Constance horrified because she didn&#x27;t want him to die.

Luke has discovered that, while the aliens love the cold, they hate heat. Luke has also discovered that Gibby is dead at this point having been frozen by Natasha. Luke teams up with Detective Amanda (his former girlfriend) and obtains a home-made flamethrower, determined to put an end to the aliens&#x27; terror. Luke confronts the aliens and kills Natasha and Lily by burning them, not realizing the truth of their mission. He then chases Constance and confronts her, but the flamethrower runs out of propane. Seeing him vulnerable, Constance leaps on top of him, knocking him to the ground. She straddles him and beats him down, then releases her tentacles, preparing to throat-rape him. However, just before Luke is impregnated, Amanda shows up and shoots Constance, knocking her off. Using an ax, Luke breaks open high-pressure pipes and kills Constance with steam. Luke now has solid evidence of the aliens&#x27; existence as there were witnesses who saw them in their true form, and he leaves Amanda to deal with them while he runs off with Alex.

Alex takes Luke to her apartment, and the two profess their love for each other. They take off their clothes and prepare to have sex. Alex mounts Luke, and tells him she can finally have her way with him. There&#x27;s a sudden flashback to the very beginning of the movie when the jock finds the dead men. He looks up and sees Alex who then says &quot;You&#x27;re early&quot;. Luke realizes Alex is an alien, minutes too late. He screams as she pins him down and her tentacles appear. The camera zooms out of the room as Luke&#x27;s screams fade away as he is presumably raped and impregnated.

<text>Viscount of Arbuthnott is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1641, along with the subsidiary title Lord Inverbervie, for Sir Robert Arbuthnott. The Viscount of Arbuthnott is the hereditary chief of Clan Arbuthnott.

At the time of the 16th Viscount&#x27;s death in 2012, the family held the genealogical record of being one of an unbroken male line living in the same spot for more than 800 years. Around 1188, William the Lion granted ancestor Hugh de Swinton the lands of Arbuthnott, where the family estate and clan association headquarters remain to this day.

All Scottish viscounts have &#x27;of&#x27; in their titles, contrary to English viscounts who are styled simply &#x27;Viscount X&#x27;. However, most Scottish viscounts have now adopted the English practice; only the Viscount of Arbuthnott and, to a lesser extent, the Viscount of Oxfuird, continue to use &#x27;of&#x27;.

The family seat is Arbuthnott House, Arbuthnott, near Inverbervie in Kincardineshire, although the current Viscount and his wife do not live there. Rather, the heir apparent and his family live within the Arbuthnott House.

<text>Pingu is an animated children&#x27;s television series originally produced in Switzerland. It was co-created by Otmar Gutmann and Erika Brueggemann. It centres on the titular anthropomorphic emperor penguin and his family, who live in the South Pole. The series aired on SF DRS for four series from 7 March 1990 to 9 April 2000, and was produced by the Swiss animation studio Pingu Filmstudio; with Swiss toy company Editoy AG, and later on, Pingu BV handling IP ownership of the series.

The series has been popular outside of Switzerland, particularly in the United Kingdom and Japan, in part due to its lack of a real spoken language. Nearly all dialogue is in an invented grammelot &quot;penguin language&quot; referred to as &#x27;Penguinese&#x27; or &#x27;Pinguish&#x27;, consisting of babbling, muttering, and the titular character&#x27;s characteristic sporadic honking sound, which can be popularly recognized as &quot;Noot noot!&quot; or other variants, accompanied by turning his beak into a megaphone-like shape. In the first four series, all the characters were performed by Italian voice actor Carlo Bonomi, using a language of sounds he had already developed and used earlier for Osvaldo Cavandoli&#x27;s &quot;La Linea&quot;. 

After British children&#x27;s company HIT Entertainment purchased Pingu BV in 2001, they produced a revival run of Pingu for two additional series in the United Kingdom through their in-house studio Hot Animation, which aired on CBeebies from 1August 2003 to 3March 2006. It was nominated for a BAFTA award in 2005. The characters were jointly voiced by David Sant and Marcello Magni. A computer-animated revival series produced in Japan, entitled &quot;Pingu in the City&quot;, ran for two seasons on NHK from 7October 2017 until 30March 2019. A third revival series, being animated in stop-motion like the original, is currently under development at Mattel Television and Aardman Animations.

The IP rights to Pingu are currently held by an entity owned by HIT/Mattel named Joker, Inc., which is usually called through its trade name &quot;The Pygos Group&quot; on copyright and trademark notices related to the &quot;Pingu&quot; property.

==Storyline==

The program is set in Antarctica and focuses around penguin families living and working in igloos. The main character, Pingu, belongs to one such family. He frequently goes on adventures with his little sister, Pinga, and often gets into mischief with his best friend, Robby, and his love interest, Pingi.

==Production history==
In 1984, Erika Brueggemann was working at Schweizer Fernsehen (the German-speaking division of SRG SSR) when she was introduced to animator Otmar Gutmann. Gutmann pitched a clay animation show starring sea lions who crawled around in a funny way. Erika Brueggemann liked the idea of a clay cartoon character, but she preferred the clay penguins that Gutmann had made. She suggested that the main character should walk upright like a human and asked, &quot;Why not a penguin?&quot;

Brueggemann&#x27;s colleague, Guido Steiger, agreed with her idea. Gutmann was not immediately convinced, since he had already created many sea lion characters out of plasticine, but he eventually pushed forward with the penguin idea too. According to Erika Brueggemann, she gave &quot;countless demonstrations on my part about how &#x27;my&#x27; penguin had to move and act&quot;. From this framework, Brueggemann, Gutmann and their team created a seven-minute pilot, &quot;Pingu: Eine Geschichte Für Kinder Im Vorschulalter&quot;, which was finished in 1986.

The pilot was screened at the 1987 Berlin Film Festival, where it won the Kleiner Baer award. Its positive reception persuaded the director of Schweizer Fernsehen, , to commission an entire series of &quot;Pingu&quot; cartoons.

The series began production in 1988 and started airing on SF DRS from 1990–2000, originally consisting of 104 five-minute episodes and one special 25-minute episode. The original stories were written by Brueggemann and Guido Steiger, and some of the later stories were written by Silvio Mazzola. These episodes were animated at Trickfilmstudio in Russikon, Switzerland. In the styling of voices, a retroscript was chosen, and all voices were performed by Italian voice actor Carlo Bonomi without a script, using a language of noises he had already developed and used for Osvaldo Cavandoli&#x27;s &quot;La Linea&quot;. This feature enabled people of diverse linguistic backgrounds to follow the story.

In 1993, David Hasselhoff released a single titled &quot;Pingu Dance&quot;, a rap song (in Switzerland only) based on the &quot;Pingu&quot; shorts and featuring samples of Penguinese. A portion of the song is used as the theme to &quot;Pingu&quot; in the third and fourth series, as well as the re-dubs of the first two series. It was also heard in the re-dubbed version of the episode &quot;Pingu Looks After the Egg&quot; (retitled &quot;Pingu Helps with Incubating&quot;), replacing the &quot;Woodpeckers from Space&quot; song from the original version.

A special 25-minute episode, &quot;Pingu at the Wedding Party&quot;, was also produced in 1997 and introduced a family of green penguins.

===HIT Entertainment buyout===
On 29October 2001, HIT Entertainment bought the rights to the series, including the original 104 episodes and the wedding special, for £15.9 million. HIT later revived the show and produced a further 52 episodes from 2003–2006. These episodes were animated through stop motion like the original, but used resin casts of the original clay puppets, which had deteriorated by this time.

The HIT Entertainment episodes were made by a completely new team at HOT Animation, but co-creator Erika Brueggemann still traveled to the company&#x27;s headquarters in the United Kingdom to check on production. At the time, she said, &quot;Last year a production company from England bought everything... I traveled to Manchester last summer and met their highly motivated team who worked with great commitment, humor and responsibility towards children. I think Pingu is in good hands now.&quot;

Contrary to some sources, there was never any CGI used in these later episodes. When HIT Entertainment bought the rights, Carlo Bonomi was replaced with new voice actors Marcello Magni and David Sant. Magni and Sant, Italian and Spanish actors based in London, both had mime and clowning backgrounds and were already aware of the clown language grammelot, on which the penguin language was based.

In February 2012, Mattel acquired Pingu through its purchase of HIT Entertainment which was rebranded to Mattel Television shortly after.

===Japanese popularity and &quot;Pingu in the City&quot;===
From its debut in the country in 1992, &quot;Pingu&quot; became well known in Japan. According to writer Silvio Mazzola in 1996, &quot;Pingu&quot; was most popular with high-school girls, with over 90% of Japanese girls aged 13–17 knowing about it. In 2020, an exhibition event commemorating the 40th anniversary of the original &quot;Hugo&quot; animation was held in Tokyo. &quot;Pingu&quot; currently airs as part of NHK&#x27;s children&#x27;s program &quot;Nyanchu&#x27;s World&quot;, and also on Cartoon Network Japan. Various merchandise exclusive to the country has been created, including tie-in toys with KFC and Mister Donut, as well as various video games.

A Japanese-produced reboot of the series, titled was announced in 2017. It premiered on NHK-E on 7October 2017. Unlike its previous series, it is computer-animated, and features Pingu and his family moving to a big city. Each episode involves Pingu attempting to help out anyone there with their jobs, although he usually messes it up. The series was produced by Polygon Pictures in the same style of the original stop motion series through computer animation. It was directed by Naomi Iwata and written by both Kimiko Ueno and Shigenori Tanabe, with music done by Ken Arai. It features voices by Ryota Iwasaki and Fumiya Tanaka, in a similar style to Carlo Bonomi, David Sant, and Marcello Magni.

===Second revival===
On 21October 2024, it was announced that a remake of the series was being co-developed by Aardman Animations and Mattel Television.

==Reception==
&quot;Pingu&quot; has received mostly positive reviews. Common Sense Media gave it 4 out of 5 stars, stating: &quot;Parents need to know that this claymation series is funny, endearing, and entertaining. Although [it] is appropriate for all ages, the plots might be difficult for the youngest viewers to follow&quot;. According to a 2008 &quot;Slate&quot; article, the series is &quot;an international sensation&quot;, but still remains obscure among American audiences.

<text>Peter Checkland (born 18 December 1930, in Birmingham, UK) is a British management scientist and emeritus professor of systems at Lancaster University. He is the developer of soft systems methodology (SSM): a methodology based on a way of systems thinking systems practice. Systems practice is the idea of uncovering an optimal solution within complex environments, thus leading to a thorough understanding of the system, analysing and adapting to change in the environment. In an important way his work preceded data science and change management disciplines in the next century.

== Biography ==
Checkland attended George Dixon&#x27;s Grammar School, and in 1954 received a M.A. degree in chemistry at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he graduated with 1st class honours.

He worked in the industry for 15 years as a manager in ICI&#x27;s chemicals business. At the end of the 1960s he joined the pioneering department of Systems Engineering at Lancaster University, where he became professor of Systems. At Lancaster he led a programme of action research. This research team developed a new way of tackling problem situations faced by managers – Soft Systems Methodology. The SSM approach is now used and taught worldwide. Since the 1990s he is Professor Emeritus of Systems in Lancaster University Management School.

Peter Checkland worked on the editorial board of journals such as European Journal of Information Systems; the International Journal of Information Management; the International Journal of General Systems; the Systems Practice; and the Systems Research journal.

In 1986 Peter Checkland was president of the Society for General Systems Research, now International Society for the Systems Sciences. In May 1996 he was awarded an honorary degree from the Open University as Doctor of the University. In 2004 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Economics, Prague. In 2007 he was awarded the Beale Medal by the OR Society, in recognition of his sustained and significant contribution to the philosophy, theory and practice of operational research. In 2008 he received the INCOSE Pioneer Award.

<text>Cabo Delgado is the northernmost province of Mozambique. It has an area of and a population of 2,320,261 (2017). As well as bordering Mtwara Region in the neighboring country of Tanzania, it borders the provinces of Nampula and Niassa. The region is an ethnic stronghold of the Makonde tribe, with the Makua and Mwani as leading ethnic minorities.

Pemba is the capital of the province; other important cities include Montepuez and Mocímboa da Praia.

==History==

The province shares its name with Cape Delgado (), a coastal headland on the border between Mozambique and Tanzania, which forms the northernmost point in Mozambique.

On 25 September 1964, FRELIMO guerrillas arrived from Tanzania and, with help from some individuals of the surrounding population, attacked a Portuguese administrative post in the province. This raid marked the beginning of the Mozambican War of Independence, part of the Portuguese Colonial War, the former of which was an armed struggle between the Portuguese colonial authorities in the then-Portuguese Overseas Province of Mozambique and the independence movement. This province was the focus of Operation Gordian Knot, where the Portuguese forces attempted to wipe out the guerrilla bases in the province.

===Jihadist insurgency===

Beginning in October 2017, armed Islamist extremists linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) launched a jihadist insurgency in the Cabo Delgado region. The militants launched attacks and committed mass beheadings, and in August 2020 seized the port town of Mocimboa da Praia. The group sometimes refers to itself as &quot;al-Shabaab&quot;, although they do not have known links with the Somali al-Shabaab, a different jihadist group. The International Crisis Group reported in March 2021 that while ISIL has contact with the jihadists in Mozambique and has given some level of financial assistance, ISIL likely does not exert command and control authority over the group.

Mozambique Defence Armed Forces have been battling the extremists. Many civilians have been displaced by the fighting. In September 2020, ISIL insurgents captured Vamizi Island in the Indian Ocean. Over fifty people were beheaded by terrorists in the province in April 2020 and a similar number in November 2020. In March 2021, the NGO Save the Children reported that Islamist militants were beheading children, some as young as 11.

On March 24, 2021, the militants seized Palma, murdering dozens of civilians and displacing more than 35,000 of the town&#x27;s 75,000 residents. Many fled to the provincial capital, Pemba. In July 2021 the Southern African Development Community deployed its military mission to the province.

As of February 2022, there are still a few civilians being killed due to the lingering insurgency and several insurgent camps were found by the Mozambican authorities.

== Demographics ==
===Languages===
After the 2007 Census it was found that native speakers of Makhuwa were 67%, Portuguese 6%, Makonde 3%, Mwani, a Swahili dialect, 5%, and Swahili proper 1.5%. Of unknown language were a 16%.

===Religion===
Mozambique is a majority-Christian country; however two northern provinces have an Islamic majority – Niassa (61 percent) and Cabo Delgado (54 percent). In the north of the province, Islam has few adherents in the Mueda Plateau, a region inhabited mostly by the Makonde people; the coastal districts of the northeast, inhabited by the Mwani people are instead overwhelming Muslim. The Makhuwe are nominal Catholic or Muslim adherents, forming Muslim majorities in the central strip of the province.
In Cabo Delgado, only three districts have a Catholic majority – Muidumbe (67 percent) and Mueda (54 percent) in the north and Namuno (61 percent) in the south. Two other districts have significant Catholic populations – Nangade (42 percent Catholic, 36 percent Muslim) in the north and Chiure (44 percent Muslim, 42 percent Catholic) in the South, whilst twelve have Muslim majorities, including Pemba; four are more than 90 percent Muslim. Coastal administrative posts are all over 75 percent Muslim.

<doc id="448195" wikidata="Q599489" url="?curid=448195" title="Euphorbus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Euphorbus (Ancient Greek: Εὔφορβος &quot;Euphorbos&quot;) was a Trojan hero during the Trojan War.

== Description ==
John Tzetzes describes Euphorbus as handsome man with &#x27;the loveliest locks among the curly-haired&#x27;, into which with gold and other ornaments were braided. Homer describes his hair as like that of the Charites, and as being bound with gold and silver.

== Family ==
In the &quot;Iliad&quot; Euphorbus is described as the son of Panthous and Phrontis, and thus also brother to Polydamas and Hyperenor. In his &quot;Chiliades&quot; or &quot;Book of Histories&quot;, Tzetzes relays that Orpheus gives Euphorbus&#x27; parents as the naiad Abarbarea and Boucolides.

== Mythology ==

In the &quot;Iliad&quot; Euphorbus wounded Patroclus before the Achaean hero was killed by Hector, and was then killed by Menelaus in the fight for Patroclus&#x27; body. Tzetzes relates that Euphorbus was the second to strike Patroclus with the god Apollo being the first.

In Homer&#x27;s account Menelaus is prevented from taking Euphorbus&#x27; armour through the actions of Apollo, who, in disguise, drew Hector&#x27;s attention to Euphorbus&#x27; death. but other sources claim that the shield was taken by Menelaus who dedicated it as an offering in a temple. According to Pausanias this was the temple of Hera in Argos, though Diogenes Laërtius claimed it was the temple of Apollo at Didyma.

== Reincarnation ==

Several sources from the 4th Century BCE onwards relate a tradition in which Euphorbus was the subject of reincarnation. These accounts often includes a story of someone who claimed that they used to be Euphorbus travelling to a temple and identifying an offering within as the shield that Euphorbus had used at Troy. Several versions also assert that the 6th century BCE philosopher Pythagoras claimed to be a reincarnation of Euphorbus. 

The Roman author and grammarian Aulus Gellius states that it was well known that Pythagoras claimed to have been a reincarnation of Euphorbus and adds that Dicaearchus and Clearchus give further details of the chain of reincarnations claimed by Pythagoras. The Greek sophist Philostratus also includes the story of Pythagoras&#x27; claim in his &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot;.

The poet Ovid includes both the details of verification via shield and the later reincarnation as Pythagoras in his epic poem &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. The 3rd century CE biographer Diogenes Laërtius reports this story in his &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;, giving as a source the Greek philosopher Heraclides of Pontus. In this account Pythagoras claimed that Euphorbus was one reincarnation in a string of previous lives which began with the Argonaut Aethalides. Aethalides&#x27; father, Hermes, offered to grant him any wish except for immortality, and Aethalides therefore chose to be able to remember, even in death, everything that had happened to him. In this variant of the story after Aethalides had lived as Euphorbus he became Hermotimus, who, wishing to prove that he had previously been Euphorbus, travelled to the Temple of Apollo at Didyma, and pointed out the shield of Euphorbus which had been dedicated there by Menelaus.

Although Heraclides is the earliest surviving source for the Pythagorean tradition, Walter Burkert suggests that the fact that the story is also known to Dicaearchus suggests that the tradition predates Heraclides, but nonetheless credits Heraclides with combining different independent traditions of euphorbian reincarnations.

<doc id="448199" wikidata="Q1785991" url="?curid=448199" title="Force-field analysis">
<text>In social science, force-field analysis provides a framework for looking at the factors (&quot;forces&quot;) that influence a situation, originally social situations. It looks at forces that are either driving the movement toward a goal (helping forces) or blocking movement toward a goal (hindering forces). The principle, developed by Kurt Lewin, is a significant contribution to the fields of social science, psychology, social psychology, community psychology, communication, organizational development, process management, and change management.

==History==
Lewin, a social psychologist, believed the &quot;field&quot; to be a Gestalt psychological environment existing in an individual&#x27;s (or in the collective group) mind at a certain point in time that can be mathematically described in a topological constellation of constructs. The &quot;field&quot; is very dynamic, changing with time and experience. When fully constructed, an individual&#x27;s &quot;field&quot; (Lewin used the term &quot;life space&quot;) describes that person&#x27;s motives, values, needs, moods, goals, anxieties, and ideals. 

Lewin believed that changes of an individual&#x27;s &quot;life space&quot; depend upon that individual&#x27;s internalization of external stimuli (from the physical and social world) into the &quot;life space&quot;. Although Lewin did not use the word &quot;experiential&quot; (see experiential learning), he nonetheless believed that interaction (experience) of the &quot;life space&quot; with &quot;external stimuli&quot; (at what he calls the &quot;boundary zone&quot;) was important for development (or regression). For Lewin, the development (or regression) of an individual occurs when their &quot;life space&quot; has a &quot;boundary zone&quot; experience with external stimuli. Note it is not merely the experience that causes a change in the &quot;life space&quot;, but the acceptance (internalization) of external stimuli.

Lewin took these same principles and applied them to the analysis of group conflict, learning, adolescence, hatred, morale, German society, etc. This approach allowed him to break down common misconceptions of these social phenomena and to determine their basic elemental constructs. He used theory, mathematics, and common sense to define a force field and hence to determine the causes of human and group behaviour.

<doc id="448201" wikidata="Q310435" url="?curid=448201" title="Louis the Blind">
<text>Louis the Blind ( – 5 June 928) was king in Provence and Lower Burgundy from 890 to 928, and also king of Italy from 900 to 905, and also the emperor between 901 and 905, styled as Louis III. His father was king Boso, from the Bosonid family, and his mother was Ermengard, a Carolingian princess. In 905, he was blinded and lost Italy, retreating to his remaining domains in Provence and Lower Burgundy.

In historiography, he is stilled as King of Provence, or King of Burgundy. 

==Early reign==
Born c. 880, Louis was the son of Boso, the usurper king of Provence, and Ermengard, a daughter of Emperor Louis II. Upon Boso&#x27;s death on 11 January 887, Louis was still a child, and under guardianship of his mother. Instead of unilaterally proclaiming her son as the new king in regions previously held or claimed by his father, she decided to improve Louis′ claims, and thus approached her relative, the emperor Charles the Fat. In May, Ermengard traveled to Charles′ court with Louis, and received confirmation of family estates. Charles also adopted Louis, and put both mother and son under his protection.

In May 889, Ermengard traveled to the court of Charles&#x27; successor, Arnulf, to make a new submission, while at the same time seeking the blessing of Pope Stephen V. The short work, &quot;Visio Karoli Grossi&quot;, may have been written shortly after Charles&#x27; death to support Louis&#x27;s claim. If so, Louis must have had the support of Fulk the Venerable, Archbishop of Reims. On the other hand, the &quot;Visio&quot; may have been written later, circa 901, to celebrate (and support) Louis&#x27;s imperial coronation.

In August 890, at the Diet of Valence, a council of bishops and feudatories of the realm, after hearing the recommendation of the pope, and receiving notification of Charles the Fat&#x27;s previous agreement to the proposition, proclaimed Louis as king in Lower Burgundy and Provence.

His kingdom was smaller than his father&#x27;s initial realm, as it did not include Upper Burgundy (lost to Rudolph I of Burgundy), nor any of West-Frankish Burgundy, absorbed by Richard the Justiciar, Duke of Burgundy. This meant that Louis′ kingdom was restricted to the environs of Vienne and Provençal regions. Since he was still young, local barons elected Ermengard to act as his regent, with the support of Louis&#x27;s uncle, Richard the Justiciar. In 894, Louis himself did homage to Arnulf.

In 896, Louis waged war on the Saracens. Throughout his reign he fought with these Saracen pirates, who had established a base at Fraxinet in 889 and had been raiding the coast of Provence, alarming the local nobility.

==Conflict with Berengar==
In 900, Louis, as the grandson and heir of the Emperor Louis II, was invited into Italy by various lords, including Adalbert II, Margrave of Tuscany, who were suffering under the ravages of the Magyars and the incompetent rule of Berengar I. Louis thus marched his army across the Alps and defeated Berengar, chasing him from Pavia, the old Lombard capital, where, in the church of San Michele, he was crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy on 12 October 900. He travelled onwards to Rome, where, in 901, he was crowned emperor by Pope Benedict IV. However, his inability to stem the Magyar incursions and impose any meaningful control over northern Italy saw the Italian nobles quickly abandon his cause and once again align themselves with Berengar. In 902, Berengar defeated Louis&#x27;s armies and forced him to flee to Provence and promise never to return.

In 905, Louis, after again listening to the Italian nobles who were tired of Berengar&#x27;s rule, this time led by Adalbert I of Ivrea, launched another attempt to invade Italy. Once again throwing Berengar out of Pavia, he marched and also succeeded in taking Verona with only a small following, after receiving the promise of support from the bishop, Adalard. Partisans of Berengar in the town soon got word to Berengar of Louis&#x27;s exposed position at Verona and his limited support. Berengar returned, accompanied by Bavarian troops, and entered Verona in the dead of night. Louis sought sanctuary at the church of St Peter, but he was captured. On 21 July 905, Louis had his eyes put out (for breaking his oath), and was forced to relinquish his royal Italian and imperial crowns. Later, Berengar became emperor. After this last attempt to restore his power over Italy, Louis continued to rule Provence for over twenty years, though his cousin Hugh, count of Arles, was the dominant figure in the territory.

Louis returned to Vienne, his capital, and by 911, he had put most of the royal powers in the hands of Hugh. Hugh was made Margrave of Provence and Marquis of Vienne and moved the capital to Arles. As regent, Hugh married Louis&#x27;s sister Willa. Louis lived out his days until his death in obscurity, and through his life he continued to style himself as Roman emperor. He was succeeded by his brother-in-law in 928.

==Marriages and heirs==
In 899, Louis III was betrothed to Anna of Constantinople, the daughter of Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise and his second wife, Zoe Zaoutzaina. The evidence for this is a letter by Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos in which he testifies that Leo VI had united his daughter to a Frank prince, a cousin of Bertha, to whom came later a great misfortune. That unfortunate prince could only be Louis III, whose mother Irmingardis was a first cousin of Bertha and who was blinded on 21 July 905. This betrothal occurred shortly before the fall of Taormina to the Arabs, and was part of extended diplomatic activities meant to strengthen Byzantine alliances with the western powers to preserve Byzantine territory in southern Italy.

The question of whether the betrothal was ever followed up by an actual marriage is still a matter of some controversy. Louis fathered a son called Charles-Constantine, who would become Count of Vienne. Charles&#x27; mother is not named in any sources. There has been modern speculation, proposed by Previté-Orton and championed by Christian Settipani, that she was Anna,the daughter of Leo VI and Zoe Zaoutzaina, based both upon the documented betrothal, as well on the onomastic evidence, stating that Charles-Constantine&#x27;s name points to a Byzantine mother. Shaun Tougher doubts they were ever married.

Detractors of the theory point out that when Anna was born, however, she was the daughter of a concubine who later became empress. Her father, at the time of Charles&#x27; birth, was the reigning emperor, therefore the silence of primary sources works against this theory. In addition, Liutprand of Cremona makes no mention of this, and it would have been very interesting to him, given that he was a thorough gossip, had been ambassador to Constantinople and devoted several chapters to the misadventures of Louis in Italy with no mention of these Byzantine connections. René Poupardin believed that Constantine was not a baptismal name, but Settipani disagrees. Richer specifically stated that Charles&#x27; ancestry was tainted with illegitimacy and mentioned nothing of his mother&#x27;s supposed illustrious Byzantine parentage.

Christian Settipani challenges that theory by stating that the only reason why René Poupardin made him a bastard of Louis III was a passage by Richerius claiming that &quot;Charles Constantine (...) was from a royal race, but which nobility had been vilified by a bastard ancestry remounting to his great-great-grandfather&quot;, proving nothing about Charles-Constantine&#x27;s mother. Such a union would also account for the mention of Greek merchants in Louis’ privilege of 921.

In 914, Louis entered a second union, which would then be either his first or second marriage, by marrying Adelaide, daughter of Rudolph I of Upper Burgundy, likely mother of Rudolph, the other documented son of Louis the Blind. 

In December 915, his daughter, Anna of Provence, married Berengar. It has been suggested, largely for onomastic reasons, that Anna was a daughter of Louis III and his wife Anna, daughter of Leo VI the Wise. In that case, she would have been betrothed to Berengar while still a child and only become his &quot;consors&quot; and &quot;imperatrix&quot; in 923.

<doc id="448213" wikidata="Q7935882" url="?curid=448213" title="Viscount of Oxfuird">
<text>Viscount of Oxfuird is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1651 for Sir James Makgill, 1st Baronet, along with the subsidiary title of Lord Makgill of Cousland, also in the Peerage of Scotland, with remainder to his &quot;heirs male of tailzie and provision whomsoever&quot;. He had already been created a baronet, of Makgill, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 19 July 1625, with remainder to heirs male whatsoever. The remainder to &quot;heirs male whatsoever&quot; was a Scottish concept that permitted inheritance by persons not descended from the original grantee, but descended in the male line from male-line ancestors of the grantee. However, on the death of the first Viscount&#x27;s son, the second Viscount, the Lordship and Viscountcy were assumed (wrongfully according to a 1977 decision by the House of Lords) by his daughter Christian, as heir of tailzie and provision. Her son Robert Maitland Makgill also voted as &quot;Viscount of Oxfuird&quot; at the election of Scottish representative peer in 1733.

However, according to a decision by the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords in 1977 the rightful heir to the Baronetcy, Lordship and Viscountcy was the second Viscount&#x27;s kinsman David Makgill, the &quot;de jure&quot; third Viscount of Oxfuird (d. 1717). He was the eldest son of Sir James Makgill (d. 1661), grandson of Sir James Makgill (d. 1579), great-uncle of the first Viscount of Oxfuird. His son, the fourth Viscount, attempted to prove his claim, but was unsuccessful. Thereafter, the matter was generally left alone.

However, according to the decision by the Committee for Privileges, the rightful descent of the titles was to have been as follows. On the death of the fourth Viscount the claim passed to his kinsman John Makgill, the &quot;de jure&quot; fifth Viscount. He was the grandson of Reverend John Makgill, third son of the aforementioned Sir James Makgill (d. 1661). His younger son George Makgill, the &quot;de jure&quot; seventh Viscount, fought in the Jacobite army of Bonnie Prince Charles, was attainted but later pardoned. His great-grandson John Makgill, the &quot;de jure&quot; tenth Viscount, resumed the claim to the Baronetcy, Lordship and Viscountcy. Shortly after his death in 1906 the matter was resolved in his favour in regard to the Baronetcy, but the Lordship and Viscountcy still remained dormant. Consequently, his son George Makgill, the &quot;de jure&quot; eleventh Viscount, became the eleventh Baronet, of Makgill. He continued to petition for the revival of the lordship and viscountcy.

However, it was not until 1977 that his son Sir Donald Makgill, 12th Baronet, of Makgill, had the claim admitted by the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords and was issued with a writ of summons to the House of Lords as the twelfth Viscount of Oxfuird. His nephew, the thirteenth Viscount, was a Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords and was until his death in 2003 one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that were allowed to remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. He was succeeded by his eldest twin son. he is the present holder of the titles.

Holders of the title often style themselves, technically incorrectly, as &#x27;Viscount Oxfuird&#x27;, although the correct form &#x27;Viscount &quot;of&quot; Oxfuird&#x27; is also used.

The title of the Viscountcy is pronounced &quot;Oxfurd&quot;. The Viscounts&#x27; seat was the original Oxenfoord Castle in Midlothian, built by the MakGills in the 16th century.

The Viscount of Oxfuird is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Makgill.

<text>Zambesia, historically known as Sebitwane country, Makololo country, and Sekeletu country, is a region with deep cultural and historical significance situated in southern Africa. The area&#x27;s history predates the establishment of British and German protectorates in the late 19th century. However, following the colonial divisions and the subsequent independence of neighboring states, the Zambesi peoples found themselves divided among multiple countries, leading to cultural fragmentation and struggles for recognition and self-determination.

==History==

The region known as Zambesia has a rich and diverse history, with its roots tracing back to ancient cultures and societies that flourished along the Zambezi, Kwando, Linyanti, and Chobe Rivers. It was formerly referred to as Sebitwane country, Makololo country, and Sekeletu country. However, with the advent of colonial powers in the late 1800s, the region underwent significant changes.

==Modern challenges==
In the present day, Zambesians continue to face a range of challenges that impact their livelihoods, culture, and rights.

===Lack of indigenous status===
Zambesians lack legal recognition as indigenous peoples within the broader context of Namibia. While the Namibian Constitution prohibits discrimination based on ethnic or tribal affiliation, there is no specific national legislation addressing the rights of indigenous peoples or minorities. This lack of recognition has implications for their political representation and protection of economic, social, and cultural rights.

===Isolation and discrimination===
Geographical isolation and limited infrastructure have led to economic challenges for Zambesians, particularly those residing in the Caprivi Strip. Subsistence farming along the rivers remains a common way of life, yet job opportunities and public investments are limited. As a result, poverty rates remain high, and development is hampered.

===Business development, land disputes, and environmental degradation===
Controversies have arisen over land use decisions, such as the approval of a multinational foreign company to lease communal land for a tobacco plantation in Zambesia. This decision has sparked criticism due to concerns over its impact on traditional livelihoods, food security, and environmental degradation. The region&#x27;s potential in sectors like agriculture and tourism remains largely untapped.

===Freedom of speech and political participation===
Zambesians face limitations on their freedom of expression and political engagement. Restrictions on public demonstrations and meetings related to self-determination and political views have led to challenges in expressing their desires for political autonomy and representation.

==Legal cases==

Zambesia&#x27;s history includes legal cases of significance. The Caprivi Treason Trial, one of the largest trials in Namibia&#x27;s history, saw the arrest and subsequent acquittal of numerous individuals associated with the Caprivi Liberation Army. The trial, ongoing in some aspects, has brought attention to issues of justice and compensation for those involved.

==UNPO membership==
In international forums, the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) serves as a platform for advocating the rights and representation of marginalized communities worldwide. The region of Zambesia finds representation within UNPO through the efforts of the Movement for the Survival of the River Races in Zambesia (MOSURIRAZA), a non-violent membership-based organization led by Coordinator General Ben Siyambango. MOSURIRAZA&#x27;s dedication to empowering Zambesian voices and raising awareness about the challenges faced by the region aligns with UNPO&#x27;s mission of amplifying the concerns of unrepresented nations and peoples.

<doc id="448227" wikidata="Q319410" url="?curid=448227" title="Tiberius Gemellus">
<text>Tiberius Julius Caesar Nero, known as Tiberius Gemellus (10 October AD 19 – 37/38), was the son of Drusus and Livilla, the grandson of the Emperor Tiberius, and the cousin of the Emperor Caligula. &quot;Gemellus&quot; is a nickname meaning &quot;the twin&quot;. His twin brother, Germanicus Gemellus, died as a young child in AD 23. His father and older cousins died, and are suspected by contemporary sources as having been systematically eliminated by the powerful praetorian prefect Sejanus. Their removal allowed Gemellus and Caligula to be named joint-heirs by Tiberius in 35, a decision that ultimately resulted in Caligula assuming power and having Gemellus killed (or forced to kill himself) in late 37 or early 38.

==Background==
Gemellus was born the son of Drusus Julius Caesar and Livilla on 10 October AD 19, the same day his uncle Germanicus died in Syria. His paternal grandparents were emperor Tiberius and his wife, Vipsania Agrippina, with his maternal grandparents being general Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor. He was the twin brother of Germanicus Gemellus and the younger brother of his sister Julia. The birth of Gemellus and his twin were celebrated by Tiberius, who claimed that never before in the history of Rome had twins been born to a man as high in rank as Drusus, and the event was commemorated on the reverse of coins. His twin died while still a child in 23.

As a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, Gemellus was a close relative of all five Julio-Claudian emperors. On his father&#x27;s side, he was the grandson of emperor Tiberius, and his adoptive great-grandfather was the founder of the Roman Empire, Augustus. On his mother&#x27;s side, he was also Augustus&#x27; great-grandnephew, the nephew of Claudius, the cousin of Caligula, and the first cousin once removed of Nero.

==Life==
===Downfall of his relatives===
In the spring of 22, his father Drusus received &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot; (tribunician power) from the Senate, a clear sign that Drusus was Tiberius&#x27; heir. However, the following year marked a turning point for his father when his dispute with the powerful praetorian prefect Lucius Aelius Sejanus reached a critical point. In the account of Tacitus, Sejanus began plotting against Drusus to secure his position. On 14 September 23, his father died from what passed as natural causes. According to Cassius Dio and Tacitus, his father was poisoned by his wife Livilla at the behest of Sejanus. The exact cause of the feud is unknown.

His father&#x27;s death not only devastated Tiberius but also challenged the future of the principate. Tiberius still trusted Sejanus and had no suspicion. Since Gemellus was too young, Tiberius adopted his great-nephews by Germanicus, Nero and Drusus, and recommended them to the Senate. Nero was given the office of quaestor five years in advance and was married to Gemellus&#x27; sister Livia to combine the families of both possible successors. However, neither would live to succeed Tiberius.

By 26, the emperor had withdrawn from politics altogether and moved to Capri, leaving the management of the empire to Sejanus who then began eliminating other members of the imperial family. In 28/29, Nero was charged by the Senate with homosexuality for which he was exiled to the island of Ponza. Germanicus&#x27; son Drusus was imprisoned within the dungeon under the Imperial palace on the Palatine Hill, where he starved to death not long after. Nero died in exile in 33. Suetonius says Tiberius promoted the rise of Sejanus to secure the succession of Gemellus, his natural grandson, at the expense of Germanicus&#x27; sons Nero and Drusus.

Sejanus remained powerful until his sudden downfall and summary execution in October 31, the exact reasons for which remain unclear. On 26 October 31, just eight days after his death, his wife Apicata committed suicide. According to Cassius Dio, she left a message for the emperor: his son had been murdered by his wife Livilla and her lover, Sejanus. The story should be read with caution. Barbara Levick says that Sejanus must have murdered Drusus in self-defense because only Tiberius stood between the Praetorian Prefect and the end of his career at the hands of Drusus. Furthermore, she says it is even less likely that Livilla would have been complicit in the destruction of her family, the key to her children&#x27;s future. Levick dismisses the accusation of Apicata as the revenge of a woman whose husband left her for another.

===Succession===
The deaths of his cousins elevated Gemellus and his older cousin Gaius Caesar (Caligula). As there was no formal mechanism for succession of the imperial office, the only legal way in which Tiberius could promote an heir who was too young to assume the political powers of emperor was to bequeath to him his own estate upon which much of the Roman state had come to depend. According to Suetonius, Tiberius had suspicions of Gaius but he detested Gemellus as he believed him to be the result of an adulterous affair by his mother. Gemellus&#x27; young age was another factor in the advancement of Caligula, who was made quaestor in 33. The two were summoned by Tiberius to Capri in 35 where they were made joint-heirs to his estates. Tacitus records that while they were in Capri, Tiberius looked at Caligula in tears, with Gemellus in his arms, and told him: 

Tiberius died on 16 March 37, and Caligula became Emperor. He accomplished this with the aid of Praetorian prefect Macro and the consuls of 37 who agreed to nullify Tiberius&#x27; will, thereby allowing him to inherit all of the estates which otherwise would have been divided with Gemellus. Gemellus was formally granted his &quot;toga virilis&quot; (toga of manhood), was adopted by Caligula, co-opted into the Arval Brethren, and given the title of &quot;princeps iuventutis&quot; (leader of the youth). His &quot;tirocinium&quot;, the public ceremony where young men donned the toga and became eligible for military service, was held in July 37, and a &quot;congiarium&quot; of 75 denarii was distributed to each citizen by Caligula. Comments by Tacitus and Suetonius that Gemellus was still a child this year, despite the fact that he was 18, may refer to his mental development. This would explain why he had not yet received the toga of manhood.

It is possible that his adoption meant an official recognition and acceptance as Caligula&#x27;s heir. Philo saw this as a ploy to put Gemellus under Caligula&#x27;s &quot;patria potestas&quot; (power of a father), and perhaps to convince the Senate to go along with nullifying Tiberius&#x27; will. Adopting Gemellus gave Caligula time to deal with the succession issue.

===Death===
Following an illness suffered by Caligula, Gemellus was put to death in late 37 or early 38. Cassius Dio places his death, and that of Caligula&#x27;s father-in-law, Marcus Junius Silanus, in late 37. Their replacements in the Arval Brethren were not found until 24 May 38. He goes on to explain that Gemellus waited for a chance to benefit from Caligula&#x27;s illness. According to Philo, Caligula&#x27;s pretended reason was a conspiracy. Suetonius says that Gemellus took medicine for a chronic cough and that the smell was detected, leading to accusations of taking an antidote for poison. He was ordered by Caligula to commit suicide, for which soldiers gave him a sword and had to help him, because he is said not to have known how to kill himself with it.

Dio notes that Gemellus was charged with praying for and anticipating Caligula&#x27;s death. The historian Anthony Barrett observes that Gemellus would have represented Caligula during his illness at nonpolitical events with his uncle Claudius representing the emperor at games. He suggests that Caligula viewed anything that Gemellus did in his name with paranoia although Gemellus&#x27;s only named supporter (to the extent that he should co-rule with Caligula) was Aulus Avilius Flaccus, the prefect of Egypt.

No mention of his death was made by Caligula to the Senate, and Gemellus&#x27;s tomb makes no mention of his adoptive relation to the emperor, simply reading: 

==In popular culture==
Gemellus is played by Douglas Melbourne in the episode &quot;Zeus, by Jove!&quot; of the 1976 BBC TV series &quot;I, Claudius&quot;.

Gemellus is played by Bruno Brive in the 1979 film &quot;Caligula&quot;.

<doc id="448229" wikidata="Q605787" url="?curid=448229" title="Tete Province">
<text>Tete is a province of Mozambique. It has an area of 98,417 km2 and a population of 2,648,941 (2017 census).

Tete is the capital of the province. The Cahora Bassa Dam is situated in this province.

== Districts ==

On March 21, 2013, Mozambique&#x27;s Assembly of the Republic authorized the creation of 13 new districts throughout the nation. Two were added to Tete. Tete Province&#x27;s districts include:
*Angónia District
*Cahora-Bassa District
*Changara District
*Chifunde District
*Chiuta District
*Tete, the capital city of the province
*Doa District
*Macanga District
*Magoé District
*Marávia District
*Marara District
*Moatize District
*Mutarara District
*Tsangano District
*Zumbo District

== Demographics ==
==Tete Fossil Forest==
A fossil site of global significance covers almost 1500 square km of the region. Well-preserved fossil wood from the Late Permian provides an insight into the flora of the area just prior to the end-Permian mass extinction. Many species are recorded, notably of conifers, all within the Matinde Formation which comprises sandstones, siltstones and coal beds. Marking its importance, the International Union of Geological Sciences has included the site within its &#x27;First 100 IUGS Geological Heritage Sites&#x27; list, published in October 2022. The forest is located in the district of Magoé, between Cahora Bassa and Magoé and approximately 250 km west of the city of Tete.

== Coal resources ==
=== History of coal discovery ===
In 1859 Richard Thornton completed the first studies of coal occurrence in the Tete Province as part of an exhibition under Dr. David Livingstone. In his report from the trip, Mr. Thornton stated that the coal, which was dug by natives from an outcropping seam on the bank of the River Muntizi, showed no tendency to cake; was free-burning; contained very little sulphur or iron although a large proportion of ash along with a small amount of gaseous matter 

=== Coal reserves ===
The Tete Province is reported to host coal reserves of approximately 6.7 billion tons, of which 3 billion tons represent sub-economic or economic grades. The province was then regarded geologically as the largest undiscovered coal province in the world and it is estimated that the Province could be producing 25% of the world&#x27;s coking coal by 2025.

==== Moatize coal deposit ====

The largest coal reserve presently discovered in the Tete Province is the Moatize metallurgical and thermal coal deposit which contains 2.4 billion tons of coal and is located with the Moatize sub-basin. Vale SA bid US$122.8 million for exploration and development rights of the project in 2008. Today, the project is a working mine which has now doubled its original output and is producing 22 million metric tons of coal per year

=== Local coal geology ===
Most coal resources are located within the remnants of the Ecca Rock Group, member of the Karoo Supergroup, and are hosted within the Zambezi graben. The coal seams were formed during the early and late Permian and deposits are associated with non-marine terrestrial clastic sedimentary sequences of the Karoo Supergroup. Depositional environments were primarily fluvial and deltaic but also included some minor lacustrine and shoreline settings.

=== Coal licenses ===
In Mozambique, 95% of coal licenses issued have been granted to forty different companies operating within the Tete Province. On 29 September 2011 the Mozambican government suspended the issuing of new coal licenses in the Tete Province in order to assess to what extent companies currently hold licenses in the Province and whether they are complying with contracts signed by the government.

=== Investment in coal development ===
A large amount of investment has been made portending to the development of coal resources and infrastructure required for mining and development. The International Finance Corporation, member of the World Bank Group has announced that it will invest up to US$5 million in Baobab Resources Plc&#x27;s exploration projects with the intention of fostering economic development.

In 2011 Vale approved a US$6 billion expansion of its Moatize coal project in order to increase output from 11 million tons per year mined initially to 22 million tons per year.

The Mozambican government have undertaken a US$375 million refurbishment of the 600 km rail link between Moatize and Beira which was severely damaged during the Mozambican Civil War. Furthermore, a deep-water international port facility is being constructed in Beira. In addition to this port at Beira, a coal terminal at Chinde, north of Beira is being planned by coal producers that will have a 20 million tonne terminal and whose opening will coincide with the beginning of production at the Zambeze Project, owned by Rio Tinto, in 2015. The link between Beira Port and the Tete Province is being referred to as the &#x27;Beira Corridor&#x27;, along which there are now plans to upgrade all major rail freight routes so that they have the capacity to transport coal resources.
=== Community impacts ===

Local communities have been relocated from their land in order for the development of coal resources to commence. Vale relocated 5,000 people into new &#x27;settlements&#x27; in order to develop its projects. The &#x27;settlements&#x27; offered new housing and infrastructure however, people must pay for any energy which they consume.

Rio Tinto have established the &#x27;Riversdale Training Centre&#x27;, Tete, where currently 28,300 candidates are registered and 1,172 people have been trained in various civil trades and building. At the Moatize Coal Mine, 90% of Vale&#x27;s employees and contractors are Mozambicans.

<text>The Adele language is spoken in central eastern Ghana and central western Togo. It belongs to the geographic group of Ghana Togo Mountain languages (traditionally called the &quot;Togorestsprachen&quot; or Togo Remnant languages) of the Kwa branch of Niger–Congo.

<doc id="448233" wikidata="Q1247822" url="?curid=448233" title="Burnham-on-Sea">
<text>Burnham-on-Sea is a seaside town in Somerset, England, at the mouth of the River Parrett, upon Bridgwater Bay. Burnham was a small fishing village until the late 18th century when it began to grow because of its popularity as a seaside resort.

Burnham-on-Sea forms part of the parish of Burnham-on-Sea and Highbridge and shares a town council with its neighbouring small market town of Highbridge. According to the 2011 census the population of the parish (including Highbridge) was 19,576, of which the most populous wards &#x27;Burnham Central&#x27; and &#x27;Burnham North&#x27;; totalled 13,601.

Burnham-on-Sea is famous for its low lighthouse. The lighthouse was built in 1832 and is a Grade-II listed building with a red and white striped facade.

The position of the town on the edge of the Somerset Levels and moors where they meet the Bristol Channel, has resulted in a history dominated by land reclamation and sea defences since Roman times. Burnham was seriously affected by the Bristol Channel floods of 1607, with the present curved concrete wall being completed in 1988. There have been many shipwrecks on the Gore Sands, which lie just offshore and can be exposed at low tides. Lighthouses are hence prominent landmarks in the town, with the original lighthouse known as the Round Tower built to replace the light on the top of the 14th-century tower of St Andrews Church. The pillar or High Lighthouse and the low wooden pile lighthouse or &quot;Lighthouse on legs&quot; on the beach were built to replace it. The town&#x27;s first lifeboat was provided in 1836 by the Corporation of Bridgwater.

== History ==
The name Burnham is derived from &quot;Burnhamm&quot;, as it was called in the will of King Alfred, made up from the Old English words &quot;Burna&quot; meaning stream and &quot;Hamm&quot; for enclosure. On-Sea was added later as there are several other towns of the same name in England.

The history of Burnham-on-Sea is the history of the reclamation of the Somerset Levels from the River Severn and the Bristol Channel. The Romans were the first peoples to try to reclaim the Somerset levels, and it was their people who were probably the first settlers in the high sand dunes behind the River Parrett. This could have been in part to maintain navigational systems, to aid ships entering the River Parrett and what is now Highbridge. When the Romans left, the system of drainage they installed was not maintained, and the areas reverted to become a tidal salt flat during the Anglo Saxon period.

It is likely that at the time of the Norman Domesday book, settlements existed at Burnham and Huntspill, their common boundary running along what is now the Westhill Rhyne. The church at Burnham and its lands were given to Gloucester Abbey in the 12th century, later transferred to Wells Cathedral along with up to 50 houses surrounding the church. Burnham was part of the hundred of Bempstone.

One of the earliest recorded incidents to affect the town was the Bristol Channel floods of 1607, since when various flood defences have been installed. In 1911 a concrete wall was built. After the Second World War, further additions to the defences against the sea were added by bringing part of the remains of a Mulberry harbour used for the Normandy Landings, and burying them in the sand. Today the town is defended from flooding by a large curved concrete wall, completed in 1988 following serious flooding in 1981. The wall runs along the Esplanade, and serves as the canvas for a wide variety of graffiti and street art.

 was a in the United States Navy built in 1918 to 1919. In 1940 she was transferred to the British under the agreement with the United Kingdom exchanging American destroyers for bases in the Atlantic. She transferred to the Royal Navy where she served as HMS &quot;Burnham&quot; (H82) during the Second World War. In 1942, &quot;Burnham&quot; was formally adopted by Burnham-on-Sea. In 1944, she was used on aircraft training duties in the Western Approaches Command, which allowed a contingent from the ship to visit the town and march through its streets. &quot;Burnham&quot; was reduced to reserve at Milford Haven, Wales, in November 1944. She was ultimately scrapped at Pembroke, in December 1948.

== Geography ==

Burnham-on-Sea is notable for its beach and mudflats, the danger they pose to individuals and shipping, and the efforts to which locals have gone in defending their town and preventing loss of life. Burnham is close to the estuary of the River Parrett where it flows into the Bristol Channel, which has the second highest tidal range in the world. At , it is second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.
Burnham&#x27;s extensive mud flats are characteristic of Bridgwater Bay and the rest of the Bristol Channel, where the tide can recede for over . Bridgwater Bay consists of large areas of mud flats, saltmarsh, sandflats and shingle ridges, some of which are vegetated. It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1989, and is designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention.

Apex Leisure and Wildlife Park, in the south-west corner of Burnham-on-Sea, north of the River Brue, occupies an area of more than . The park was created from excavated clay pits, which were flooded, and the lakes are now home to many types of wildlife and leisure activities.

Hinkley Point is a headland extending into Bridgwater Bay west of Burnham-on-Sea, one the opposite side the mouth of the River Parrett. The landscape of Hinkley Point is dominated by two closed nuclear power stations: Hinkley Point A and Hinkley Point B, and Hinkley Point C, which is under construction.

=== Climate ===
Along with the rest of South West England, Burnham has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter, mean minimum temperatures of are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

=== Sea defences ===
Burnham was seriously affected by the Bristol Channel floods of 1607, and various flood defences have been installed since then. In 1911, a concrete sea wall was built, and after World War II further additions to the defences were made using the remains of a Mulberry harbour.

On 13 December 1981, a large storm hit the North Somerset coast. Meteorological conditions resulted in a very intense secondary low-pressure area moving rapidly at into the Bristol Channel, with pressure dropping from between 00:00 and 18:00. This caused a large rising surge in sea level, with the maximum surge at Hinkley Point measured at above the tidal level Ordnance Datum (OD) at 20:25, and measured at Avonmouth. The wind was measured at from the west. Over topping of the sea defences along a stretch of the Somerset coast at 22 locations from Clevedon to Porlock began after 19:30, and continued until about 21:30 when the wind speed had reached from the west. Although there was no loss of life, the resultant flooding covered of land, affecting 1,072 houses and commercial properties, with £150,000 worth of livestock killed and £50,000 of feed and grain destroyed. Wessex Water Authority estimated the total cost of the damage caused at £6M. This resulted in a three-year programme of sea defence assessment, repair and improvement.

Burnham, being the largest occupied town within the 1981 surge affected area, also bore the brunt of the resultant damage. 400 properties were affected, with pavements, stone and concrete from the sea wall ripped up and the Esplande destroyed; total damage within the parish was estimated at £1.5M. Although emergency repairs were undertaken, Wessex Water Authority began planning new sea defences for the town. Construction work started in 1983 on a £7M scheme, creating what was then Britain&#x27;s biggest wave return wall. The scheme raised the level of the sea wall and the promenade by , by creating a long and high sea wall, and a new wider Esplanade. Taking five years to complete and coming into operation in 1988, beach access is now via a series of raised steps for visitors, with three vehicle access points which can be closed during storms using sealed gates.

=== Lifeboats and BARB ===
There have been many shipwrecks on the Gore Sands. The first lifeboat was sent to Burnham by the Bridgwater Corporation in 1836, and a replacement boat in 1847.

The first Royal National Lifeboat was funded by the town of Cheltenham, and arrived in 1866. The lifeboat was removed in 1930 because of the difficulty in getting a full crew, and because the launching arrangements were not suitable for a powered boat. The current Burnham-on-Sea Lifeboat Station is the base for Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) search and rescue operations. The present station was opened in 2003. It operates two inshore lifeboats (ILBs), a B Class rigid-hulled boat and an inflatable D Class.

The Burnham-on-Sea Area Rescue Boat now known as BARB Search &amp; Rescue was set up in 1992 to fund and operate rescue craft in the Bridgwater Bay area. BARB&#x27;s boat house on the sea front was built in 1994 by the &quot;Challenge Anneka&quot; TV show. In 2002, Lelaina Hall, a five-year-old girl from Worcester, died on the mud flats before help could reach her. The outcry over her death prompted a Western Daily Press campaign to fund an inshore hovercraft.
BARB currently operates the &quot;Spirit of Lelaina&quot; alongside her sister hovercraft the &quot;Light of Elizabeth&quot;, which is named after Lelaina&#x27;s sister.

== Governance ==
The civil parish of Burnham-on-Sea and Highbridge has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. In recent years the parish council has become a significant grant funder of local organisations and events. There is currently a debate underway about the correct disbursement and monitoring of these grants, following allegations of impropriety regarding some councillors.

Burnham was a large ancient parish, and until the late 19th century included the then hamlet of Highbridge and rural areas around Edithmead. In 1894 Highbridge became a separate civil parish, itself divided in 1896 between the new civil parishes of North Highbridge (within Highbridge Urban District) and Burnham Without. Burnham itself became Burnham Urban District, renamed Burnham-on-Sea Urban District in 1917. In 1933 it annexed Highbridge Urban District. This combined urban district became a civil parish in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. Unitl April 2023, the town now fell within the non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed under the same legislation. On 1 April, all Somerset councils were replaced with a single unitary authority, Somerset Council, which is responsible for running all council services.

There are two electoral wards in the town itself (Central and North) making the total population at the 2011 census mentioned above of 13,601.

It falls within the Bridgwater county constituency which elects one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, by the first past the post voting system. Prior to Brexit in 2020, it was within the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.

== Landmarks ==

=== Lighthouses ===
Because of its position near the mouth of the River Parrett, and the constantly shifting sands of the Bristol Channel, there has always been a significant risk to shipping in the area. As a result, several lighthouses, have been built.

The original lighthouse, known as the Round Tower, was built after the local vicar, either John Goulden in 1764 or Walter Harris in 1799, raised a subscription amongst the local population to replace the light on the top of St Andrews Church tower. The four-storey Round Tower was built next to the church. It was taken over and improved by Trinity House in 1815, and operated until 1832, following which the top two storeys were removed.
The pillar or High Lighthouse was designed and built by Joseph Nelson for Trinity House in 1830, and equipped with a paraffin lamp. The ground floor was in diameter and the top room . It was automated in 1920. In 1992, it was sold to a member of the Rothschild family, who owned it until 1996, when it was bought at auction by Patrick O&#x27;Hagan. Conversion for residential use included the removal of the 6th floor and the construction of stairs where there had previously only been ladders. A Grade II listed building, it is now available for holiday lets.

The low wooden pile lighthouse or &quot;Lighthouse on legs&quot;, or &quot;Nine Pins&quot;, was built two years later, also by Joseph Nelson, to complement the High Lighthouse. It is a total of high, with the light being at above the sand. It stands on nine wooden piers, some with plate metal reinforcement. The structure is whitewashed with a vertical red stripe on the sea side. The lights were inactive between 1969 and 1993, but were recommissioned when the High Lighthouse lights were permanently deactivated. They have a focal plane of and provide a white flash every 7.5 seconds, plus a directional light (white, red, or green depending on direction) at a focal plane of .

=== Pier ===

A stone pier was erected in 1858 by the Somerset Central Railway. Soon afterwards, in 1860, a steamer service to Wales was inaugurated, but it was never a commercial success, and ended in 1888. The pier retains its railway lines under a surface coating of concrete.

The concrete pier, built in 1911–1914, is claimed to be the shortest pier in Britain. However it is merely a beach pavilion, and is thus discounted by many pier experts. In 2008, it was rated amongst the top five piers in Britain by the &quot;Daily Express&quot;.

=== The Royal Clarence Hotel ===
The hotel was built in 1796 and incorporated the first bar in Burnham-on-Sea.

=== Listed buildings ===
The Esplanade along the sea front contains several listed buildings from the early 19th century, including number 44, which is also known as Steart House, and numbers 46 and 47.

On Berrow Road, near the High Lighthouse, numbers 4, 6 and 8 were part of a terrace built between 1838 and 1841. Number 31 was previously a lodge. On the corner of Berrow Road and Sea View is a drinking fountain from 1897 with a single dressed stone pier and moulded plinth, topped by a cast iron urn. Each side has the lions head design with those on the north and south sides giving water into a Purbeck Marble bowl.

== Education ==
Primary schools in the town providing education for children up to the age of 11 include: Berrow Church of England Primary School, Burnham-on-Sea Community Infants School, St Andrew&#x27;s Church of England Junior School, St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School and Nursery.

The nearest secondary school is The King Alfred School, a coeducational comprehensive school located in Highbridge. The school is a specialist Sports College. In 2007, the school celebrated its 50th anniversary. The facilities of the dual-use King Alfred Sports Centre, which is next to the school site, are shared between the school and town.

== Religious sites ==

The parish church, St. Andrew&#x27;s, is a Grade I listed building dating from the 14th century. It has a high tower, which leans significantly from the vertical, caused by its poor foundations. During the 18th century, a light was placed on the tower to guide fishing boats into the harbour. The church contains a number of marble carvings designed by Sir Christopher Wren for the private chapel in the Palace of Westminster.
There is also an unofficial mosque by Burnham Swimming Centre, otherwise the nearest official mosque would be in Weston-super-mare.

There are also places of worship for Baptists, Methodists, Roman Catholics and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in the town.

== Transport ==
Burnham-on-Sea railway station was the terminus of the Burnham branch of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, but the tracks continued onto the jetty, where ferry services to South Wales could be boarded. The station opened in 1858 as Burnham, and was renamed Burnham-on-Sea in 1920. It closed to scheduled passenger traffic in 1951 and stopped being used for excursions in 1962. It finally closed to goods traffic in 1963.

The former Great Western Railway station is now known as Highbridge and Burnham. The station was opened as &quot;Highbridge&quot; on 14 June 1841, when the Bristol and Exeter Railway opened its broad gauge line as far as Bridgwater. A road crossed the line at the north end of the platforms, and a goods shed was provided beyond this on the west side of the line. The Bristol and Exeter Railway amalgamated with the Great Western Railway on 1 January 1876.

The town is approximately from the M5 motorway and the A38 road.

There are two main bus routes serving Burnham-on-Sea. These are service 21A from Taunton operated by The Buses of Somerset and service 20 from Weston-super-Mare operated by First West of England.

== Culture and sport ==
The town is part of the West Country Carnival circuit.

Burnham and Berrow Golf Course lies at the North of the town and is a 36-hole championship.

Burnham-on-Sea is a noted venue for kitesurfing, as well as other water sports, and has its own sailing club.

Land side many activities cater for either the dominant resident elderly population or the seasonal tourists, including bowls, and there is also a swimming pool and sports academy.

The Burnham-on-Sea rugby union club was formed in 1887. It was wound up after World War 2 and subsequently reformed. After winning the Tribute Somerset Premier in the 2008–09 they were promoted to the Western Counties North, a level seven rugby union league for clubs based in the south-west of England.

The Burnham-on-Sea cricket club was established in 1861 and has played continuously since then. They currently play in the Somerset Cricket League Premier Div. The ground is in Stoddens Road and boasts fine facilities. The best-known player in the club&#x27;s history is Sammy Woods, who played Test cricket for England and Australia during the 1890s. The club has also provided a number of players for Somerset in the County Championship competition.

In 2016 the town held the Burnham Spray Jam which decorated the streets with artwork from John D&#x27;Oh, Andrew Burns Colwill, SPZERO, Irony, Cheba, Diff, Angus, The Agent, Miss Wah, 23 Magpies, Korp and many others. This year the Spray Jam has been incorporated into BOSfest which will also include music, poetry and street entertainment.

The town is home to multi-award winning eat:Festivals, who organise three food and drink festivals in this town and in 9 other Somerset towns. The festivals have very high sustainability standards and are always free to attend. Featuring workshops, demos, master classes alongside over 100 local producers from within 25 miles and lots of free entertainment.

== Notable residents ==
Thomas Alan Stephenson, a marine biologist, was born in the town in 1898, and it was also the birthplace of John Pople, a theoretical chemist, in 1925. The novelist Isobel English was sent to La Retraite, a Burnham-on-Sea convent school, in 1920. Arthur Gilbert, confirmed as the world&#x27;s oldest triathlete in 2011, lives and competes in the town. George Shelley of X Factor boy band Union J lived in Burnham-on-Sea and attended The King Alfred School, Highbridge, where he studied his GCSEs. Also resident is world champion Scottish Darts player Gary Anderson.

<text>Sofala is a province of Mozambique. It has a population of 2,259,248 (2017 census). Beira is the capital of the province, named for the ruined port of Sofala which is to the south.

==History==
Portuguese landholder and imperialist established a base at the river mouth at what is now Beira in 1884.

Sofala Province is one of the strongholds of the RENAMO. In late 1978 RENAMO guerrillas were &quot;ranging into Sofala Province and launching attacks along the Beira–Chimoio road and rail line, the Dondo–Inhaminga corridor&quot;.
Some of the more scarcely populated areas of the province are affected by landmines; defensive rings around villages were still common in some rural areas according to mid 1990s reports by Oxfam.

In March 2019, the province was severely affected by Cyclone Idai, with its capital city of Beira being largely destroyed. The flooding resulting from this storm was widespread throughout the province and the rest of Central Mozambique.

== Demographics ==
== Geography ==

Sofala Province, in central-eastern Mozambique, covers an area of . The province is bordered to the north by Tete Province, to the northeast by Zambezia Province, to the south by Inhambane Province, and to the west by Manica Province.
Rivers flowing through the province include the Chiveve River, the Buzi River, the Save River, which flows along the Inhambane provincial border, and the Púnguè River, which flows into the sea at Beira. On the Urema River, a tributary of the Púnguè, the river forms the lagoon which are home to hundreds of hippopotamus. The valleys of the province are subject to flooding; in late January 2012, unusually heavy rain caused widespread flooding along the banks of the Púnguè and the Save, and other major rivers in Africa such as the Zambezi and Limpopo, leading over 100,000 people in total to be evacuated.

Gorongosa National Park, at the southern end of the Great African Rift Valley, covers several thousand square kilometres, including the valley floor and parts of surrounding forested plateaus, which contain miombo and montane forests. The park contains the Mount Gorongosa, a mountain which is considered sacred to the people of the country. On the eastern slope of the mountain is a number of vegetation zones according to elevation, and there are numerous limestone caves in the vicinity.

===Districts===

Sofala Province is divided into the 13 districts of:
*Beira District
*Buzi District
*Caia District
*Chemba District
*Cheringoma District
*Chibabava District
*Dondo District
*Gorongosa District
*Marromeu District
*Machanga District
*Maringué District
*Muanza District
*Nhamatanda District

==Economy==

The city of Beira, the provincial capital and Mozambique&#x27;s second-largest city and the busiest port in the country, plays a key role in the local economy. Principal exports include ores, tobacco, food products, cotton, hides and skins, with the chief imports including fertilizers, equipment and textiles, liquid fuels and wheat. The Mozambique Company had their headquarters in Beira, during the building of the railway across the country. Many buildings remain from the colonial period, it is &quot;as famed for its seafood as for its tawdry nightlife&quot;. The Makuti Lighthouse of Beira was built in 1904. The oil trade has been important to the regional economy, with Beira connected by pipeline to Zimbabwe in 1960. The port of Beira is crucial for the trade in oil involving Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia and Congo. In the 21st century, agricultural productivity in the province has shown significant improvement, reducing poverty. The Austrian Development Cooperation has played a major role in investment in the province.

<text>Tete is the capital city of Tete Province in Mozambique. It is located on the Zambezi River, and is the site of two of the four bridges crossing the river in Mozambique. A Swahili trade center before the Portuguese colonial era, Tete continues to dominate the west-central part of the country and region, and is the largest city on the Zambezi. In the local language, Nyungwe, Tete (or Mitete) means &quot;reed&quot;.

==History==
The region was an important Swahili trade center before the Portuguese colonial era. On the east coast of Africa the Portuguese were drawn to Mozambique and the Zambezi river by news of a local ruler, the Munhumutapa, who was said to have had fabulous wealth in gold. In their efforts to reach the Munhumutapa, the Portuguese established in 1531 two settlements far up the Zambezi – one of them, at Tete, some from the sea. The Munhumutapa Kingdom and gold mines remained autonomous and mostly isolated from the Portuguese. But in this region of east Africa – as in Portuguese Guinea and Angola in the west – Portuguese involvement became sufficiently strong to survive into the third quarter of the 20th century. Under Portuguese influence Tete had become a market centre for ivory and gold by the mid-17th century. Given a Portuguese town charter in 1761, it became a city of the Portuguese Overseas Province of Mozambique in 1959. After the Portuguese Colonial War in Portuguese Africa and the April 1974 military coup in Lisbon, the then Portuguese Overseas Province of Mozambique become an independent state. The newly independent People&#x27;s Republic of Mozambique, created in 1975 after the exodus of Mozambique&#x27;s ethnic Portuguese, descended into civil war between 1977 and 1992.

== Transportation ==
Chingozi Airport on the northeastern side of the city has a 2.4 km paved runway. The one-kilometre-long Samora Machel Bridge, finished in 1973 by the Portuguese and designed by Edgar Cardoso, is a vital link on the major highway linking not just the northern and southern parts of the country, but Zimbabwe and Malawi as well. A second bridge south of the city was opened in late 2014 to allow traffic to Zambia or Malawi to bypass the provincial capital. Tete&#x27;s bridges, the rail Dona Ana Bridge, and the Armando Emilio Guebuza Bridge at Caia are the only bridges across the lower Zambezi.

== Demographics ==
Projected to be the ninth fastest growing city on the African continent between 2020 and 2025, with a 5.56% growth. 

==Climate==
Tete has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;).

<doc id="448239" wikidata="Q51665" url="?curid=448239" title="Jewish views on Jesus">
<text>Adherents of Judaism do not believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah or Prophet nor do they believe he was the Son of God. In the Jewish perspective, it is believed that the way Christians see Jesus goes against monotheism, a belief in the absolute unity and singularity of God, which is central to Judaism; Judaism sees the worship of a person as a form of idolatry, which is forbidden. Therefore, considering Jesus divine, as “God the Son”, is forbidden.

Judaism&#x27;s rejection of Jesus as the Messiah is based on Jewish eschatology, which holds that the coming of the true Messiah will be associated with events that have not yet occurred, such as building the Third Temple, a Messianic Age of peace, and the ingathering of Jews to their homeland.

Judaism does not accept any of the claimed fulfilments of prophecy that Christianity attributes to Jesus. In the State of Israel, Israeli Jews who endorse the belief that Jesus is the Messiah or Christ are not considered Jews either by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel nor by the Israeli government.

==Background==
The belief that Jesus is God, the Son of God, or a person of the Trinity, is incompatible with Jewish theology. Jews believe Jesus did not fulfill messianic prophecies that establish the criteria for the coming of the Messiah. Judaism does not accept Jesus as a divine being, an intermediary between humans and God, a messiah, or holy. Belief in the Trinity is also held to be incompatible with Judaism, as are a number of other tenets of Christianity.

===Jewish theology===

====Oneness and indivisibility of God====

In Judaism, the idea of God as a duality or trinity is heretical – it is even considered by some polytheistic. According to Judaic beliefs, the Torah rules out a trinitarian God in Deuteronomy (6:4): &quot;Hear Israel, the LORD is our God, the LORD is one.&quot;

Judaism teaches that it is heretical for any man to claim to be God, part of God, or the literal son of God. The Jerusalem Talmud states explicitly: &quot;If a man claims to be God, he is a liar.&quot;

Paul Johnson, in his book &quot;A History of the Jews&quot;, describes the schism between Jews and Christians caused by a divergence from this principle:

To the question, Was Jesus God or man?, the Christians therefore answered: both. After 70 AD, their answer was unanimous and increasingly emphatic. This made a complete breach with Judaism inevitable.

In the 12th century, the preeminent Jewish scholar Maimonides codified core principles of Modern Judaism, writing &quot;[God], the Cause of all, is one. This does not mean one as in one of a pair, nor one like a species (which encompasses many individuals), nor one as in an object that is made up of many elements, nor as a single simple object that is infinitely divisible. Rather, God is a unity unlike any other possible unity.&quot; Some Orthodox Jewish scholars note that the common poetic Jewish expression, &quot;Our Father in Heaven&quot;, was used literally by Jesus to refer to God as &quot;his Father in Heaven&quot; (cf. Lord&#x27;s Prayer).

====God is not corporeal====
Maimonides&#x27; 13 principles of faith includes the concept that God has no body and that physical concepts do not apply to him. In the &quot;Yigdal&quot; prayer, found towards the beginning of the Jewish prayer books used in synagogues around the world, it states &quot;He has no semblance of a body nor is He corporeal&quot;. It is a central tenet of Judaism that God does not have any physical characteristics; that God&#x27;s essence cannot be fathomed.

==Jesus as the Jewish Messiah==

Judaism&#x27;s idea of the messiah differs substantially from the Christian idea of the Messiah. In orthodox Rabbinic Judaism the messiah&#x27;s task is to bring in the Messianic Age, a one-time event, and a presumed messiah who is killed before completing the task (i.e. compelling all of Israel to walk in the way of Torah, repairing the breaches in observance, fighting the wars of God, building the Temple in its place, gathering in the dispersed exiles of Israel) is not the messiah. Maimonides states,
Jews believe that the messiah will fulfill the messianic prophecies of the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel. Judaism interprets Isaiah 11:1 (&quot;And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a twig shall grow forth out of his roots.&quot;) to mean that the messiah will be a patrilineal bloodline descendant of King David. He is expected to return the Jews to their homeland and rebuild the Temple, reign as king, and usher in an era of peace and understanding where &quot;the knowledge of God&quot; fills the earth, leading the nations to &quot;end up recognizing the wrongs they did Israel&quot;. Ezekiel states the messiah will redeem the Jews.

The Jewish view of Jesus is influenced by the fact that Jesus lived while the Second Temple was standing, and not during an exile. Being conceived via the Holy Spirit (as espoused by orthodox Christian doctrine), it would be impossible for Jesus to be a patrilineal bloodline descendant of King David. He never reigned as king, and there was no subsequent era of peace or great knowledge. Jesus died without completing or even accomplishing part of any of the messianic tasks, which Christians say will occur at a Second Coming. Rather than being redeemed, the Jews were subsequently exiled from Judaea, and the Temple destroyed (as of yet is has not been rebuilt). These discrepancies were noted by Jewish scholars who were contemporaries of Jesus, as later pointed out by Nachmanides, who in 1263 observed that Jesus was rejected as the messiah by the rabbis of his time.

Moreover, Judaism sees Christian claims that Jesus is the textual messiah of the Hebrew Bible as being based on mistranslations, given that Jesus did not fulfill any of the Jewish Messiah qualifications.

===Prophecy and Jesus===

According to the Torah ( and ), the criteria for a person to be considered a prophet or speak for God in Judaism are that he must follow the God of Israel (and no other god); he must not describe God differently from how he is known to be from Scripture; he must not advocate change to God&#x27;s word or state that God has changed his mind and wishes things that contradict his already-stated eternal word. There is no concept of the Messiah &quot;fulfilling the law&quot; to free the Israelites from their duty to maintain the &quot;mitzvot&quot; in Judaism, as is understood in much of Christianity or some Messianic Judaism.

Deuteronomy 13:1 says, &quot;Be careful to observe only that which I enjoin upon you; neither add to it nor take away from it.&quot;

Even if someone who appears to be a prophet can perform supernatural acts or signs, no prophet or dreamer can contradict the laws already stated in the Tanakh. Thus, any divergence espoused by Jesus from the tenets of scriptural Judaism would disqualify him from being considered a prophet in Judaism. This was the view adopted by Jesus&#x27; contemporaries, as according to rabbinical tradition as stated in the Talmud (Sotah 48b) &quot;when Malachi died the Prophecy departed from Israel.&quot; As Malachi lived centuries before Jesus it is clear that the rabbis of Talmudic times did not view Jesus as a divinely inspired prophet. Furthermore, the Bible itself includes an example of a prophet who could speak directly with God and could work miracles but was &quot;evil&quot;, in the form of Balaam.

===Jesus and salvation===

Judaism does not share the Christian concept of salvation, as it does not believe people are born in a state of sin. Judaism holds instead that man is born to strive for perfection, and to follow the word of God. 
Sin is then divided into two categories; transgression against God (through a failure to fulfill ritual obligations, such as not sanctifying the Sabbath), and transgression against man (through a failure to fulfill moral obligations, such as committing gossip). To gain absolution, a person can repent of that sin, regret the sin, and commit to never do the sin again. God will then forgive their transgression against Him, although one may still be punished depending on the severity of the sin. If a sin is committed against man, the person needs to gain forgiveness from the one he sinned against; it cannot be forgiven by God or another person.

==Jesus in rabbinical literature==

===The Talmud===

Various works of classical Jewish rabbinic literature are thought to contain references to Jesus, including some uncensored manuscripts of the Babylonian Talmud and the classical midrash literature written between 250 CE and 700 CE. There is a spectrum of scholarly views on how many of these references are actually to Jesus.

Christian authorities in Europe were largely unaware of possible references to Jesus in the Talmud until 1236, when a convert from Judaism, Nicholas Donin, laid thirty-five formal charges against the Talmud before Pope Gregory IX, and these charges were brought upon rabbi Yechiel of Paris to defend at the Disputation of Paris in 1240. Yechiel&#x27;s primary defence was that the Yeshu in rabbinic literature was a disciple of Joshua ben Perachiah, and not to be confused with Jesus (&quot;Vikkuah Rabbenu Yechiel mi-Paris&quot;). At the later Disputation of Barcelona (1263) Catalonian rabbi Nachmanides made the same point.

Jacob ben Meir (11th century), Jehiel ben Solomon Heilprin (17th century), and Jacob Emden (18th century) support this view, but not all rabbis took this view. &quot;The Kuzari&quot; by Yehuda Halevi (), understood these references in Talmud as referring to Jesus of Nazareth based on evidence that Jesus of Nazareth lived 130 years prior to the date that Christians believe he lived. Profiat Duran&#x27;s anti-Christian polemic &quot;Kelimmat ha-Goyim&quot; (&quot;Shame of the Gentiles&quot;, 1397) makes it evident that Duran gave no credence to Yechiel&#x27;s theory of two Jesuses.

Modern scholarship on the Talmud has a spectrum of views. From Joseph Klausner, R. Travers Herford and Peter Schäfer, who see some traces of a historical Jesus in the Talmud, to the views of Johann Maier and Jacob Neusner, who consider that there are little or no historical traces and texts have been applied to Jesus in later editing, to others such as Daniel Boyarin (1999), who argue that Jesus in the Talmud is a literary device used by Pharisaic rabbis to comment on their relationship to and with early Jewish Christians.

The Vatican&#x27;s papal bull issued in 1554 censored the Talmud and other Jewish texts, resulting in the removal of references to Yeshu. No known manuscript of the Jerusalem Talmud makes mention of the name, although one translation (Herford) has added it to &quot;Avodah Zarah 2:2&quot; to align it with similar text of &quot;Chullin 2:22&quot; in the Tosefta. In the Munich (1342 CE), Paris, and Jewish Theological Seminary of America manuscripts of the Talmud, the appellation &quot;Ha-Notzri&quot; is added to the last mention of a Yeshu in &quot;Sanhedrin 107b&quot; and &quot;Sotah 47a&quot; as well as to the occurrences in &quot;Sanhedrin 43a&quot;, &quot;Sanhedrin 103a&quot;, &quot;Berachot 17b&quot; and &quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; 16b-17a. Student, Zindler and McKinsey &quot;Ha-Notzri&quot; is not found in other early pre-censorship partial manuscripts (the Florence, Hamburg and Karlsruhe) where these cover the passages in question.

Although &quot;Notzri&quot; does not appear in the Tosefta, by the time the Babylonian Talmud was produced, &quot;Notzri&quot; had become the standard Hebrew word for Christian and the &quot;Yeshu Ha-Notzri&quot; found in the Talmud has become the controversial rendition of &quot;Jesus the Nazarene&quot; in Hebrew. For example, by 1180 CE the term &quot;Yeshu Ha-Notzri&quot; can be found in the Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; (&quot;Hilchos Melachim&quot; 11:4, uncensored version).

===&quot;Toledot Yeshu&quot;===
In the &quot;Toledot Yeshu&quot; the name of Yeshu is taken to mean &quot;yimakh shemo&quot; (&quot;May his name be erased)&quot;. In all cases of its use, the references to Yeshu are associated with acts or behaviour that are seen as leading Jews away from Judaism to &quot;Minuth&quot;, or &quot;heresy&quot; , &quot;apostasy&quot;. Historically, the portrayals of Jesus in the Talmud and Jewish literature were used to justify antisemitic sentiments.

===Maimonides===
Maimonides lamented the pains that Jews felt as a result of new faiths that attempted to supplant Judaism, specifically Christianity and Islam. Referring to Jesus, he wrote:
Concerning Jesus of Nazareth who imagined himself to become the Messiah and was put to death by the court, the Prophet Daniel said already: &quot;also the rebellious sons of thy people will lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they will stumble.&quot; (Dan.11,14) And can there be a greater stumbling block than this: All the prophets affirmed that the Messiah would redeem Israel, save them, gather their dispersed and strengthen the commandments, but he caused Israel to be destroyed by the sword, their remnants to be dispersed, and humiliated, their changing the Torah, and misleading the world to serve gods besides the Lord.

Nonetheless, Maimonides continued, developing a thought earlier expressed in Judah Halevi&#x27;s &quot;Kuzari&quot;,
Yet no man can grasp the thoughts of the Creator of the world, for our ways are not His ways, and our thoughts are not His thoughts; And all these ways of Jesus of Nazareth and of This Ismaelite who rose after him, were only to clear the way for Messiah the King.&quot; ... .&quot; when the Messiah will really arise and he will succeed and will reign supreme, at once they shall all return and will know that they inherited lies from their forefathers and that their prophets and forefathers have misled them. (&quot;Hilkhot Melakhim&quot; 11:10–12.)

====&quot;Epistle to Yemen&quot;====
Jesus is mentioned in Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Epistle to Yemen&quot;, written about 1172 to Rabbi Jacob ben Netan&#x27;el al-Fayyumi, head of the Yemenite community:
==In Karaite Judaism==
The historical view of Jesus within Karaite Judaism is a complex one. While Karaites share Rabbanite views in rejecting Christian beliefs of Jesus&#x27; divinity and claims to messiahship, Karaites throughout history have held warmer opinions about him. Karaite scholar Jacob Qirqisani stated that some Karaites of his day believed that: 

Persian historian and Islamic theologian Al-Shahrastani reported that Karaites believed that Jesus was indeed a righteous man, but was not a prophet, and that the Gospels were not divinely revealed, but created and compiled by Jesus and his disciples. &quot;Hakham&quot; Abraham Firkovich believed Jesus himself was actually a Karaite. Controversial &quot;hakham&quot; Seraya Shapshal said:

==As a Nazarene==

In addition to being a place-name, Nazarenes were Jews who committed to certain extreme observances of religious practice, such as shaving their heads and abstaining from various activities, foods or practices, spending time in contemplation in the desert and so on. They continue being recognized as Jews, and believe Jesus lived around 130 or 140 CE and was conflated with Neoplatonic beliefs into what became the New Testament. To them, he was not God or God&#x27;s son.

==Positive historical re-evaluations==
Considering the historical Jesus, some modern Jewish thinkers have come to hold a more positive view of Jesus, arguing that he himself did not abandon Judaism and/or that he benefited non-Jews. Among historic Orthodox rabbis holding these views are Jacob Emden, Eliyahu Soloveitchik, and Elijah Benamozegh.

Moses Mendelssohn, as well as some other religious thinkers of the Jewish Enlightenment, also held more positive views. Austrian-born philosopher Martin Buber also held Jesus in great regard. A positive view of Jesus is fairly represented among modern Jews in the currents of Reform (Emil G. Hirsch and Kaufmann Kohler), Conservative (Milton Steinberg and Byron Sherwin,), and Jewish Renewal (Zalman Schachter-Shalomi).

Some modern Orthodox rabbis, such as Irving Greenberg and Jonathan Sacks, also hold positive views (Greenberg theorizes Jesus as &quot;a &quot;messiah, but not The Messiah&quot;).

Rabbi Shmuley Boteach takes this even further, following the research of Hyam Maccoby. Boteach authored &quot;Kosher Jesus&quot; in 2012, in which he depicts Jesus as &quot;a Jewish patriot murdered by Rome for his struggle on behalf of his people.&quot; Opinions of the merits of the book differ, with Israeli-American Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, President of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, praising it as &quot;courageous and thought-provoking&quot;. Boteach said that the book &quot;traces the teachings of Jesus to their original sources: the Torah, the Talmud and rabbinic literature&quot;.

<doc id="448242" wikidata="Q622799" url="?curid=448242" title="Niassa Province">
<text>Niassa is a province of Mozambique with an area of 129,056 km2 and a population of 1,810,794 (2017). It is the most sparsely populated province in the country. Lichinga is the capital of the province. There are a minimum estimated 450,000 Yao people living in Mozambique. They largely occupy the eastern and northern part of the Niassa province and form about 40% of the population of Lichinga, the capital of this province.
The Ruvuma River forms much of the northern boundary of the province with Ruvuma Region, Tanzania, while Lake Niassa forms the western border of the province, separating it from Malawi. 75% of the province remains untouched by development, and remains free of landmines. The province shares the Niassa National Reserve with neighboring Cabo Delgado Province.

==Districts==
Niassa Province is divided into the 16 districts of:
*Cuamba District
*Lago District
*Lichinga District
*Majune District
*Mandimba District
*Marrupa District
*Maúa District
*Mavago District
*Mecanhelas District
*Mecula District
*Metarica District
*Muembe District
*N&#x27;gauma District
*Nipepe District
*Sanga District
*Chimbunila District

and the municipalities of:
*Cuamba
*Lichinga
*Metangula

== Demographics ==
=== Languages ===
After the 2007 Census it was found that native speakers of Makhuwa were 42%, speakers of the Yao language 31%, speakers of the Nyanja or Chewa language a 11%, and Portuguese speakers 9%.

=== Religion ===
The majority in Niassa province practice Islam. Monotheist religion adherence was asked in the 2007 census (Protestant / Catholic / Muslim / Zion) leaving aside so-called traditional religion followers. Answers provided a majority of protestants (74%) in the administrative post of Cobue, bordering Lake Niassa and inhabited mostly by the Nyanja. The majority of the Yao are nominal Muslim (a fact that can be recognized in a map&#x27;s administrative posts north of the river Messalo). South of the river, the Makhuwas follow the Catholic or Islamic faith. 
== Education ==
In 1998, a provincial college was built in Lichinga to train teachers. Partially financed by the Irish Embassy in Maputo, it graduates 60 teachers per year. Apart from training teachers for local schools, the college offers primary school education to the local Lichinga community and works towards reducing the impact of HIV/AIDS in Niassa province.

<doc id="448243" wikidata="Q622794" url="?curid=448243" title="Nampula Province">
<text>Nampula is a province of northern Mozambique. It has an area of and a population of 5,758,920, making it the most populous province in Mozambique (2017 census). Nampula is the capital of the province.

==History==
Under Portuguese rule this province was named Moçambique but with independence, the name Mozambique was used for the entire country and the province renamed for its capital.
The island, Ilha de Moçambique, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992. Massive refugee movements due to 15 years of civil war have destroyed a unique coexistence of many cultures on this island.

==Geography==

Nampula Province is located in northeastern Mozambique. It is bordered on the north by Cabo Delgado Province and the Lúrio River, which the Mozambican government has plans to build a 120-megawatt hydroelectric plant on to supply electricity to the province and Cabo Delgado Province. Napula Province borders Niassa Province to the northwest and west, Zambezia Province to the southwest, and the Indian Ocean to the east. The Ligonha River separates it from Zambezia Province; the Makua peoples inhabit the area to the north of the river. From the south, the Malema River flows from the Namuli hills into the Ligonha. The Meluli River flows down through the province in a southeasterly direction, flowing into the Indian Ocean to the south of Angoche Island.

To the west of the city of Nampula, which lies in the heart of the province, are several hilly areas. Mountains in the province include Mount Inago (1804 m), Mount Ribaue, Mount Panda and Mount Nairucu.

==Districts==

Nampula Province is divided into the 18 districts of:
* Angoche District

==Economy==
The region is a major producer of cotton, and is known as the Cotton Belt of Nampula. Also produced in the province are cashew nuts, tobacco, gems and other minerals. Many of the cotton and tobacco farms in Nampula Province are state-owned.

The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was involved in a $507 million project with Mozambique to develop the water delivery system in Nampula Province over five years (2008-2013), to benefit an estimated 1.2 million people. The project aimed to lay down some 16 kilometers of transmission pipes, constructing or rehabilitating four pumping stations and a new distribution center, to raise the height of the Nacala Dam from to and to expand a treatment plant to enable it to process 1041 cubic meters of water per hour. An evaluation report was published in 2020. UNICEF and USAID have subsequently funded and constructed water and sanitation facilities at Ramiane Health Centre and 8 other health centres in Nampula Province.

==Demographics==
According to the 1997 census, the province had 2,975,747 inhabitants and an area of 78,197 square kilometres, hence resulting in a population density of 38.05 inhabitants per km². Between 1997 and 2007, the population grew by 25.34%. At the time of the 2007 census, a population of 3,985,613 residents was recorded. With an area 79,010 square kilometres, the population density was about 50.44 people per km².

<text>The caudate nucleus is one of the structures that make up the corpus striatum, which is part of the basal ganglia in the human brain. Although the caudate nucleus has long been associated with motor processes because of its role in Parkinson&#x27;s disease, it also plays important roles in nonmotor functions, such as procedural learning, associative learning, and inhibitory control of action. The caudate is also one of the brain structures that compose the reward system, and it functions as part of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop.

== Structure ==
Along with the putamen, the caudate forms the dorsal striatum, which is considered a single functional structure; anatomically, it is separated by a large white-matter tract, the internal capsule, so it is sometimes also described as two structures—the medial dorsal striatum (the caudate) and the lateral dorsal striatum (the putamen). In this vein, the two are functionally distinct not because of structural differences, but merely because of the topographical distribution of function.

The caudate nuclei are near the center of the brain, sitting astride the thalamus. There is a caudate nucleus in each hemisphere of the brain. Each nucleus is C-shaped, with a wider &quot;head&quot; (&quot;caput&quot; in Latin) at the front, tapering to a &quot;body&quot; (&quot;corpus&quot;) and a &quot;tail&quot; (&quot;cauda&quot;). Sometimes a part of the caudate nucleus is called the &quot;knee&quot; (&quot;genu&quot;). The caudate head receives its blood supply from the lenticulostriate artery; the tail of the caudate receives its blood supply from the anterior choroidal artery.
The head and body of the caudate nucleus form part of the floor of the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle. The body travels briefly towards the back of the head; the tail then curves back toward the anterior, forming the roof of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle. This means that a coronal section (on a plane parallel to the face) that cuts through the tail will also cross the body and head of the caudate nucleus.

===Neurochemistry===
The caudate is highly innervated by dopaminergic neurons that originate from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The SNc is in the midbrain and contains cell projections to the caudate and putamen, using the neurotransmitter dopamine. There are also inputs from various association cortices.

==Motor functions==

===Spatial mnemonic processing===
The caudate nucleus integrates spatial information with motor behavior formulation. Selective impairment of spatial working memory in subjects with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and the knowledge of the disease&#x27;s impact on the amount of dopamine supplied to the striatum have linked the caudate nucleus to spatial and nonspatial mnemonic processing. Spatially dependent motor preparation has been linked to the caudate nucleus through event-related fMRI analysis techniques. Activity in the caudate nucleus was demonstrated to be greater during tasks featuring spatial and motoric memory demands than those that involved nonspatial tasks.
Specifically, spatial working memory activity has been observed, via fMRI studies of delayed recognition, to be greater in the caudate nucleus when the activity immediately preceded a motor response. These results indicate that the caudate nucleus could be involved in coding a motor response. With this in mind, the caudate nucleus could be involved in the recruitment of the motor system to support working memory performance by the mediation of sensory-motor transformations.

===Directed movements===
The caudate nucleus contributes importantly to body and limbs posture and the speed and accuracy of directed movements. Deficits in posture and accuracy during paw-usage tasks were observed after the removal of caudate nuclei in cats. A delay in initiating performance and the need to shift body position constantly were both observed in cats after partial removal of the nuclei.

In monkeys, after the application of cocaine to the caudate nucleus and the resulting lesions produced, there was a &quot;leaping or forward movement&quot;. Because of its association with damage to the caudate, this movement demonstrates the inhibitory nature of the caudate nucleus. The &quot;motor release&quot; caused by this procedure indicates that the caudate nucleus inhibits the tendency for an animal to move forward without resistance.

==Cognitive functions==

===Goal-directed action===
A review of neuroimaging studies, anatomical studies of caudate connectivity, and behavioral studies reveals a role for the caudate in executive functioning. A study of Parkinson&#x27;s patients (see below) may also contribute to a growing body of evidence.

A two-pronged approach of neuroimaging (including PET and fMRI) and anatomical studies expose a strong relationship between the caudate and cortical areas associated with executive functioning: &quot;non-invasive measures of anatomical and functional connectivity in humans demonstrate a clear link between the caudate and executive frontal areas.&quot;

Meanwhile, behavioral studies provide another layer to the argument: recent studies suggest that the caudate is fundamental to goal-directed action, that is, &quot;the selection of behavior based on the changing values of goals and a knowledge of which actions lead to what outcomes.&quot; One such study presented rats with levers that triggered the release of a cinnamon flavored solution. After the rats learned to press the lever, the researchers changed the value of the outcome (the rats were taught to dislike the flavor either by being given too much of the flavor, or by making the rats ill after drinking the solution) and the effects were observed. Normal rats pressed the lever less frequently, while rats with lesions in the caudate did not suppress the behavior as effectively. In this way, the study demonstrates the link between the caudate and goal-directed behavior; rats with damaged caudate nuclei had difficulty assessing the changing value of the outcome. In a 2003-human behavioral study, a similar process was repeated, but the decision this time was whether or not to trust another person when money was at stake. While here the choice was far more complex––the subjects were not simply asked to press a lever, but had to weigh a host of different factors––at the crux of the study was still behavioral selection based on changing values of outcomes.

In short, neuroimagery and anatomical studies support the assertion that the caudate plays a role in executive functioning, while behavioral studies deepen our understanding of the ways in which the caudate guides some of our decision-making processes.

===Memory===
The dorsal-prefrontal cortex subcortical loop involving the caudate nucleus has been linked to deficits in working memory, specifically in schizophrenic patients. Functional imaging has shown activation of this subcortical loop during working memory tasks in primates and healthy human subjects. The caudate may be affiliated with deficits involving working memory from before illness onset as well. Caudate nucleus volume has been found to be inversely associated with perseverative errors on spatial working memory tasks.

The amygdala sends direct projections to the caudate nucleus. Both the amygdala and the caudate nucleus have direct and indirect projections to the hippocampus. The influence of the amygdala on memory processing in the caudate nucleus has been demonstrated with the finding that lesions involving the connections between these two structures &quot;block the memory-enhancing effects of oxotremorine infused into the caudate nucleus&quot;. In a study involving rats given water-maze training, the caudate nucleus was discovered to enhance memory of visually cued training after amphetamine was infused post-training into the caudate.

===Learning===
In a 2005 study, subjects were asked to learn to categorize visual stimuli by classifying images and receiving feedback on their responses. Activity associated with successful classification learning (correct categorization) was concentrated to the body and tail of the caudate, while activity associated with feedback processing (the result of incorrect categorization) was concentrated to the head of the caudate.

===Sleep===
Bilateral lesions in the head of the caudate nucleus in cats were correlated with a decrease in the duration of deep slow wave sleep during the sleep-wakefulness cycle. With a decrease in total volume of deep slow wave sleep, the transition of short-term memory to long-term memory may also be affected negatively.

However, the effects of caudate nuclei removal on the sleep–wakefulness pattern of cats have not been permanent. Normalization occurs by three months after caudate nuclei ablation. This discovery may be due to the inter-related nature of the roles of the caudate nucleus and the frontal cortex in controlling levels of central nervous system activation. The cats with caudate removal, although permanently hyperactive, had a significant decrease in rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) time, which lasted about two months. However, afrontal cats had a permanent decrease in REMS time and only a temporary period of hyperactivity.

Contrasting with associations between &quot;deep&quot;, REM sleep and the caudate nucleus, a study involving EEG and fMRI measures during human sleep cycles has indicated that the caudate nucleus demonstrates reduced activity during non-REM sleep across all sleep stages. Additionally, studies of human caudate nuclei volume in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) subjects established a correlation between CCHS and a significant reduction in left and right caudate volume. CCHS is a genetic disorder that affects the sleep cycle due to a reduced drive to breathe. Therefore, the caudate nucleus has been suggested to play a role in human sleep cycles.

===Emotion===

The caudate nucleus has been implicated in responses to visual beauty, and has been suggested as one of the &quot;neural correlates of romantic love&quot;.

Approach-attachment behavior and affect are also controlled by the caudate nucleus. Cats with bilateral removal of the caudate nuclei persistently approached and followed objects, attempting to contact the target, while exhibiting a friendly disposition by the elicitation of treading of the forelimbs and purring. The magnitude of the behavioral responses was correlated to the extent of the removal of the nuclei. Reports of human patients with selective damage to the caudate nucleus show unilateral caudate damage resulting in loss of drive, obsessive-compulsive disorder, stimulus-bound perseverative behavior, and hyperactivity. Most of these deficits can be classified as relating to approach-attachment behaviors, from approaching a target to romantic love.

===Language===
Neuroimaging studies reveal that people who can communicate in multiple languages activate exactly the same brain regions regardless of the language. A 2006 publication studies this phenomenon and identifies the caudate as a center for language control. In perhaps the most illustrative case, a trilingual subject with a lesion to the caudate was observed. The patient maintained language comprehension in her three languages, but when asked to produce language, she involuntarily switched between the three languages. In short, &quot;these and other findings with bilingual patients suggest that the left caudate is required to monitor and control lexical and language alternatives in production tasks.&quot;

Local shape deformations of the medial surface of the caudate have been correlated with verbal learning capacity for females and the number of perseverance errors on spatial and verbal fluency working memory tasks for males. Specifically, a larger caudate nucleus volume has been linked with better verbal fluency performance.

A neurological study of glossolalia showed a significant reduction in activity in the left caudate nucleus during glossolalia compared to singing in English.

===Threshold control===
The brain contains large collections of neurons reciprocally connected by excitatory synapses, thus forming large network of elements with positive feedback. It is difficult to see how such a system can operate without some mechanism to prevent explosive activation. There is some indirect evidence that the caudate may perform this regulatory role by measuring the general activity of cerebral cortex and controlling the threshold potential.

==Clinical significance==
===Caudate stroke===
Strokes can occur in the caudate nucleus and studies of patients with these kinds of strokes followed the introduction and widespread availability of computed tomography (CT) scanning in the 1970s and early 1980s. Major studies of caudate strokes have included Stein et al. (1984), Weisberg et al. (1984), Mendez et al. (1989), Caplan et al. (1990), Caplan &amp; Helgason (1995), Bokura &amp; Robinson (1997), Kumral et al. (1999), Gnanashanmugam (2011), and Kumral et al. (2023). A number of literature reviews on caudate nucleus strokes have been published, as well as a 1994 meta-analysis of basal ganglia lesions that included analysis of caudate lesions (Bhatia &amp; Marsden, 1994). Caudate strokes are rare, representing only 1% of all strokes in one population of about 3,000 stroke patients. Caudate hemorrhages account for about 7% of all intracerebral hemorrhages. Research on caudate strokes has consisted of small clinical series of patients and case reports. A 2002 review described 108 patients with 119 caudate infarcts that had been characterized, with three of the largest series having a total of 64 patients. In the 1994 meta-analysis, there were 43 patients with lesions confined to the caudate nucleus and 129 patients with lesions involving both the caudate and other structures, with 172 patients in total.

Caudate nucleus strokes can be diagnosed with CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. They are a type of subcortical stroke and are classified as ischemic (infarcts) or hemorrhagic. In one series of patients, 80% of strokes were ischemic and 20% were hemorrhagic. Caudate infarcts can be lacunar infarcts, which are small and are due to a single perforating artery occlusion, or can be striatocapsular (caudate–putamen–internal capsule) infarcts, which are larger and are due to multiple perforating artery occlusion. Caudate nucleus strokes infrequently affect only the caudate, but usually also involve neighboring areas like the anterior portion of the putamen, adjacent anterior limb of the internal capsule, adjacent corona radiata white matter, and globus pallidus. About 25 to 30% of lesions are confined exclusively to the caudate. Caudate strokes are usually unilateral, but can also be bilateral, affecting both the left and right caudate nuclei. In the 1994 meta-analysis, 90% of isolated caudate infarcts were unilateral and 10% were bilateral. Small vessel disease or penetrating-branch disease is a major mechanism of caudate strokes. Major risk factors and causes of caudate infarcts include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, previous myocardial infarct, cigarette smoking, large artery lesions, rupture of internal carotid artery aneurysms, rupture of arteriovenous malformations, cardiac embolism, and carotid artery stenosis and occlusion. Less common risk factors may include non-valvular atrial fibrillation, myocardial dyskinesia, cardiac aneurysm with a mural thrombus, syphilis, Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, and Moyamoya disease. Additionally, a case report of lacunar infarction of the caudate and adjacent structures due to high-dose oral methylphenidate use has been published.

Caudate nucleus strokes have been associated with a variety of clinical symptoms. In studies of patients with caudate infarcts, frequently occurring symptoms have included dysarthria or dysphonia (61–86%), motor weakness (40–100%), and cognitive/behavioral abnormalities (39–78%), including abulia (26–48%), agitation (29%), , hyperactivity, disinhibition (9–11%), executive dysfunction or frontal system abnormalities (26%), memory impairment, minor speech or linguistic deficits (23–50% of left-sided lesions), attention difficulties, and mood changes or depression (14–33%). Motor weakness is often absent, minor/slight, or transient, and reportedly does not occur with lesions confined exclusively to the caudate nucleus. Abulia is defined as decreased spontaneous verbal and motor activity and slowness, with symptoms including apathy, disinterest, flattened affect, lethargy, and lack of initiative for usual daily activities. Cognitive and memory impairment includes poor free recall of episodic and semantic items, verbal amnesia (33% of left-sided lesions), and visual amnesia (right-sided lesions), among other deficits. Less commonly, there are motor disorders (20–23%), like chorea (6–7%), ballism, tremor, parkinsonism (2–3%), and dystonia (9–16%), as well as more severe cognitive and behavioral problems, like psychic akinesia (loss of psychic self-activation) (12%), neglect (10% with right-sided lesions), aphasia (2–5%), and global dementia (9%, or 1 of 11 and with bilateral lesions). Among strokes in general, and/or among basal ganglia strokes specifically, certain sequelae, including apathy, abulia, fatigue, and depression, have been particularly associated with caudate strokes relative to strokes occurring in other regions. Strokes in the caudate nucleus have also been strongly associated with post-stroke restless legs syndrome (RLS). Other behavioral conditions, like obsessive–compulsive disorder, perseverations, and mania, have been reported rarely in individuals with caudate strokes as well. In one case report of bilateral caudate head damage, severe prospective memory impairment was measured, along with other deficits.

The sizes, locations, and involvements of neighboring structures define the symptoms of caudate lesions. Damage to the caudate nucleus usually presents with cognitive and behavioral symptoms rather than with neurological signs. Cognitive and behavioral symptoms are more common than motor problems (e.g., respective rates of 39% vs. 20% in the 1994 meta-analysis). Due to the predominance of cognitive and behavioral symptoms over neurological symptoms, and frequent absence of classical stroke signs, people with caudate strokes can be misdiagnosed as having primarily psychogenic illness. This can result in enduring cognitive and behavioral deficits, which can result in significant functional limitations, being overlooked. The symptoms of caudate strokes are usually more severe and persistent when they are bilateral rather than unilateral. In addition, they are more severe when other adjacent structures are also involved. Mendez et al. (1989) categorized caudate stroke patients into three groups based on stroke location and patterns of clinical symptoms: (1) apathetic or abulic, with difficulties perseverating in tasks (dorsolateral caudate); (2) restless, agitated, hyperactive, disinhibited, inappropriate, impulsive, distractible, and/or inattentive (ventromedial caudate); and (3) affective disturbances (anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder) with psychotic features (hallucinations, delusions) (dorsolateral caudate, with larger lesions and more often extending into adjacent areas). Sometimes, abulia can alternate with periods of disinhibition and agitation in people with caudate strokes. The symptoms of caudate infarcts are assumed to be due to interruption of neural circuits such as cortico–striatal–thalamic–cortical loops.

Caudate nucleus hemorrhages can mimic the symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage and can include headache, nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, decreased level of consciousness, hemiparesis, aphasia, neuropsychological disturbances, disorientation, aphasia, mental confusion, and gaze abnormalities, among others. Caudate hemorrhages are due to rupture of penetrating arteries. Aside from additional acute subarachnoid hemorrhage-like symptoms, symptoms of caudate hemorrhages are similar to those of caudate infarcts, including features like behavioral abnormalities, dysarthria, movement disorders, language disorders, and memory problems.

The prognosis of caudate strokes has been considered good and benign, with majorities of individuals recovering and becoming independent. However, patients with caudate strokes can have residual deficits and dependency needs, can worsen clinically with time, or can require institutionalization. Bokura &amp; Robinson (1997) found that some individuals with caudate strokes deteriorated on the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), a short clinical test of basic cognitive function and impairment, during follow-up over 1 to 2years, whereas patients with other subcortical lesions tended to improve over 2years. People with caudate strokes only rarely die, and generally because of underlying heart disease or other problems rather than the stroke itself. However, although having favorable prognosis in the short-term, and having previously thought to be relatively benign, lacunar strokes in general are associated with greatly increased risk of stroke recurrence, cognitive impairment and dementia, and early death in the mid- to long-term. Treatment of caudate strokes may consist of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents and management of stroke risk factors like hypertension and diabetes mellitus to reduce the risk of additional strokes. On the basis of case reports and small case series, disorders of diminished motivation, like apathy, abulia, and akinetic mutism, secondary to stroke and other causes, may be treated with dopaminergic agents and other pro-motivational medications, including psychostimulants, bupropion, atomoxetine, modafinil, dopamine agonists, levodopa, selegiline, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

===Caudate resection===
The caudate nucleus is sometimes surgically resected to treat glioma that has infiltrated the structure. Opinions in this area are mixed about resecting the caudate, with some authors reporting relatively few deficits upon caudate removal, and others recommending against removal due to poor cognitive and behavioral outcomes, for instance abulia.

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===

A 2013 study has suggested a link between Alzheimer&#x27;s patients and the caudate nucleus. MRI images were used to estimate the volume of caudate nuclei in patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s and normal volunteers. The study found a &quot;significant reduction in the caudate volume&quot; in Alzheimer&#x27;s patients when compared to the normal volunteers. While the correlation does not indicate causation, the finding may have implications for early diagnosis.

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease===

Parkinson&#x27;s disease is likely the most studied basal ganglia disorder. Patients with this progressive neurodegenerative disorder often first experience movement related symptoms (the three most common being tremors at rest, muscular rigidity, and akathisia) which are later combined with various cognitive deficiencies, including dementia. Parkinson&#x27;s disease depletes dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal tract, a dopamine pathway that is connected to the head of the caudate. As such, many studies have correlated the loss of dopaminergic neurons that send axons to the caudate nucleus and the degree of dementia in Parkinson&#x27;s patients. And while a relationship has been drawn between the caudate and Parkinson&#x27;s motor deficiencies, the caudate has also been associated with Parkinson&#x27;s concomitant cognitive impairments. One review contrasts the performance of patients with Parkinson&#x27;s and patients that strictly had frontal-lobe damage in the Tower of London test. The differences in performance between the two types of patients (in a test that, in short, requires subjects to select appropriate intermediate goals with a larger goal in mind) draws a link between the caudate and goal-directed action. However, the studies are not conclusive. While the caudate has been associated with executive function (see &quot;Goal-Directed Action&quot;), it remains &quot;entirely unclear whether executive deficits in [Parkinson&#x27;s patients] reflect pre-dominantly their cortical or subcortical damage.&quot;

===Huntington&#x27;s disease===
In Huntington&#x27;s disease, a genetic mutation occurs in the &quot;HTT&quot; gene which encodes for Htt protein. The Htt protein interacts with over 100 other proteins, and appears to have multiple biological functions. The behavior of this mutated protein is not completely understood, but it is toxic to certain cell types, particularly in the brain. Early damage is most evident in the striatum, but as the disease progresses, other areas of the brain are also more conspicuously affected. Early symptoms are attributable to functions of the striatum and its cortical connections—namely control over movement, mood and higher cognitive function.

===Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder===

A 2002 study draws a relationship between caudate asymmetry and symptoms related to ADHD. The authors used MR images to compare the relative volumes of the caudate nuclei (as the caudate is a bilateral structure), and drew a connection between any asymmetries and symptoms of ADHD: &quot;The degree of caudate asymmetry significantly predicted cumulative severity ratings of inattentive behaviors.&quot; This correlation is congruent with previous associations of the caudate with attentional functioning. A more recent 2018 study replicated these findings, and demonstrated that the caudate asymmetries related to ADHD were more pronounced in the dorsal medial regions of the caudate.

===Schizophrenia===

The volume of white matter in the caudate nucleus has been linked with patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. A 2004 study uses magnetic resonance imaging to compare the relative volume of white matter in the caudate among schizophrenia patients. Those patients with the disorder have &quot;smaller absolute and relative volumes of white matter in the caudate nucleus than healthy subjects.&quot;

===Bipolar type I===
A 2014 study found Type I Bipolar patients had relatively higher volume of gray and white matter in the caudate nucleus and other areas associated with reward processing and decision making, compared to controls and Bipolar II subjects. Overall the amount of gray and white matter in Bipolar patients was lower than controls.

===Obsessive-compulsive disorder===
It has been theorized that the caudate nucleus may be dysfunctional in persons with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), in that it may perhaps be unable to properly regulate the transmission of information regarding worrying events or ideas between the thalamus and the orbitofrontal cortex.

A neuroimaging study with positron emission tomography found that the right caudate nucleus had the largest change in glucose metabolism after patients had been treated with paroxetine. Recent SDM meta-analyses of voxel-based morphometry studies comparing people with OCD and healthy controls have found people with OCD to have increased grey matter volumes in bilateral lenticular nuclei, extending to the caudate nuclei, while decreased grey matter volumes in bilateral dorsal medial frontal/anterior cingulate gyri. These findings contrast with those in people with other anxiety disorders, who evince decreased (rather than increased) grey matter volumes in bilateral lenticular / caudate nuclei, while also decreased grey matter volumes in bilateral dorsal medial frontal/anterior cingulate gyri.

<text>Nampula is the capital city of Nampula Province in Northern Mozambique. With a population of 743,125 (2017 census), it is the third-largest city in Mozambique after Maputo and Matola. The city is located in the interior of Nampula Province, approximately 200 kilometers from the coast and is surrounded by plains and rocky outcrops. The city is a major regional centre for the entire Northern region of Mozambique, as well as parts of Central Mozambique and border areas of Malawi and Tanzania. 

The city links the port city of Nacala with land-locked Southern African countries, particularly Malawi through a road and railway line. The city has a small international airport connecting to Nairobi in Kenya, Johannesburg in South Africa, Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania and is a hub for local transport in northern Mozambique. Nampula is the centre of business in Northern Mozambique, benefitting from highly productive agricultural areas, proximity to the Nacala Development Corridor, and a fast-growing city population. 

Nampula is home to the Mozambican National Ethnographic Museum, several markets, cathedrals, mosques, universities, training institutes and schools. The city is diverse, with the native eMakhuwa population being the largest group but with a visible Indian, European, Chinese, Lebanese, Somali, and Nigerian population.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Nampula&quot; is said to be derived to the eMakhuwa word &quot;Whampula&quot;, which according to local legend refers to a tribal leader of the area in the past. 

== History ==
Nampula is a relatively new city. It was founded by the Portuguese colonial army in 1907 and elevated to city status in 1956. During the Mozambican War of Independence, Nampula was a strategic military centre for the colonial army in the fight against the FRELIMO liberation movement.

After independence in 1975, the Portuguese abandoned Nampula and rural populations migrated to the city, squatting in unplanned areas on the city outskirts. This migratory movement dramatically increased during the Mozambican Civil War, affecting Nampula in the decade between 1982 and 1992. When the war ended the Mozambican Government expected the refugees to return to the countryside, but they remained in the city. After a few years of migratory slow‐down, the growth of the city resumed, as the rapid economic development of Mozambique materialized mostly in the urban areas. Nampula, in the post‐war period, developed into a major Mozambican growth centre, attracting an increasing number of public and private investments in a wide range of economic and social areas. 

In colonial times there was a Nampula Town Hall with a very limited mandate which was dissolved in 1979. The Municipal Council of Nampula was created in 1998, alongside those of other major Mozambican cities. FRELIMO won the first local elections that year, and in the subsequent elections in 2003, 2008, and 2011. An opposition party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), won the 2013 municipal elections, led by Mahamudo Amurane. Mayor Amurane was assassinated in October 2017, and investigations into his death proved to be inconclusive. Amurane&#x27;s death led to a collapse of the MDM&#x27;s support base in Nampula and another opposition party, RENAMO, won subsequent municipal elections led by Paulo Vahanle. 

Since the establishment of the city, Nampula has had numerous mayors:
* Aurélio das Neves
* Germano José Joaquim
* Francisco Joaquim de Lima
* Narciso João Iondela
* Ishaca Abdul Ali Baraca
* Dionísio Cherewa
* Castro Namuaca
* Mahamudo Amurane
* Paulo Vahanle

== Administration ==
Nampula is divided into seven administrative zones, which are also subdivided into localities, as follows: Urbano Central, Anchilo, Muatala, Muhala, Namikopo, Napipine, and Natikiri.

== Population ==
=== Demographics ===
=== Religion ===
Nampula&#x27;s dominant religions are Christianity and Islam. A small community of Hindus are also present in the city. Its Cathedral of Our Lady of Fatima is the archiepiscopal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Nampula.

== Education ==
The city is home to the Faculty of Health Science, Universidade Lurio. In 2009 a course in optometry was launched, the first of its kind in Mozambique. The course was supported through the Mozambique Eyecare Project. The other partners include the Dublin Institute of Technology, University of Ulster and Brien Holden Vision Institute. As of 2019, 61 Mozambican students have graduated with optometry degrees from Universidade Lurio (34 male and 27 female). The optometry course is now fully embedded within Universidade Lurio&#x27;s systems and continues to recruit new students every year. Importantly, optometry is now registered as a profession in Mozambique and is recognized through membership of the African Council of Optometry (AFCO). Of the graduates, 26 are now working in public hospitals. In addition, 10 have university teaching posts (five male and five female). Seven of the graduates have enrolled on postgraduate programmes (five male and seven female).

There is a Portuguese international school, Escola Lusófona de Nampula, as well as four international English schools, with the oldest being Stella Maris International School.

== Transport ==

* The city has an airport, Nampula International Airport, which is located 4 kilometres away from the city centre. Kenya Airways currently operates thrice-a-week flights from Nairobi, while Airlink connects to Johannesburg in South Africa. LAM connects to domestic places like Pemba, Lichinga, Tete, Beira, Vilankulo, Quelimane and Maputo.
* The Nacala railway serves the city. Additionally, a railway workshop is located in the city.
* The bus stand, which can be accessed from any part of the city within 10 minutes, connects with places within Nampula province and in the neighbouring provinces. The tourist location Ilha de Moçambique, is located 200 km east of Nampula and is accessible by numerous minibuses.

== Geography ==
The city of Nampula lies in the centre of the province of Nampula and is surrounded by plains and rocky outcrops. The city lies amongst rolling hills and mountains, typical of the interior of northern Mozambique.

=== Climate ===
Nampula has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification: Aw).

== Notable locals ==
Abel Xavier, a Portuguese football player, Carlos Queiroz, a Portuguese football manager formerly in charge of Real Madrid, and football manager, Paulo Fonseca were also from Nampula, at that time a city of the Portuguese Overseas Province of Mozambique. 

Nazira Abdula, pediatrician and Mozambican Minister of Health, was born in Nampula. 

Rui Águas, Portuguese racing driver, was born in Nampula.

<text>In music, variation is a formal technique where material is repeated in an altered form. The changes may involve melody, rhythm, harmony, counterpoint, timbre, orchestration or any combination of these.

Variation is often contrasted with musical development, which is a slightly different means to the same end. Variation depends upon &quot;one&quot; type of presentation at a time, while development is carried out upon portions of material treated in &quot;many&quot; different presentations and combinations at a time.

==Variation techniques==
Mozart&#x27;s Twelve Variations on &quot;Ah vous dirai-je, Maman&quot; (1785), a French folk song known in the English-speaking world as &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot;, exemplifies a number of common variation techniques. Here are the first eight bars of the theme:
===Melodic variation===
Mozart&#x27;s first variation decorates and elaborates the plain melodic line:
===Rhythmic variation===
The fifth variation breaks up the steady pulse and creates syncopated off-beats:
===Harmonic variation===
The seventh variation introduces powerful new chords, which replace the simple harmonies originally implied by the theme with a prolongational series of descending fifths:
===Minor mode===
In the elaborate eighth variation, Mozart changes from the major to the parallel minor mode, while combining three techniques: counterpoint, suspensions and imitation:
===Other examples===
Variation techniques are frequently used within pieces that are not themselves in the form of theme and variations. For example, when the opening two-bar phrase of Chopin&#x27;s Nocturne in F minor returns later in the piece, it is instantly repeated as an elegant melodic re-working:
Debussy&#x27;s piano piece &quot;Reflets dans l&#x27;eau&quot; (1905) opens with a sequence of chords:

These chords open out into arpeggios when they return later in the piece:
Sometimes melodic variation occurs simultaneously with the original. In Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Waldstein&quot; piano sonata, the main second-subject theme of the opening movement, which is in sonata form, is heard in the pianist&#x27;s left hand, while the right hand plays a decorated version. (See also heterophony.)
While most variations tend to elaborate on the given theme or idea, there are exceptions. In 1819, Anton Diabelli commissioned Viennese composers to create variations on a waltz that he had composed:
Beethoven contributed a mighty set of 33 variations on this theme. The thirteenth of these stands out in its seemingly wilful eccentricity and determination to reduce the given material to its bare bones:
Wilfrid Mellers describes this variation as &quot;comically disruptive... The original tonal sequence is telescoped, the two-bar sequences being absorbed into the silences.&quot;

In a similar fashion, the first of the 24 variations of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot; for piano and orchestra presents a terse summary of Paganini&#x27;s original.

===Variations on material originally by other composers===

Many composers have taken pieces composed by others as a basis for elaboration. John Dowland&#x27;s &quot;Lachrimae&quot; was frequently used by other composers as a basis for sets of variations during the 17th century. Composed in 1700, the final movement of Arcangelo Corelli&#x27;s Violin Sonata Op. 5, No. 9, opens with this rather sparse melodic line:
Corelli&#x27;s fellow-composer and former student Francesco Geminiani produced a &quot;playing version&quot; as follows:
According to Nicholas Cook, in Geminiani&#x27;s version &quot;all the notes of Corelli&#x27;s violin line ... are absorbed into a quite new melodic organization. With its characteristic rhythmic pattern, Geminiani&#x27;s opening is a tune in a way that Corelli&#x27;s is not... whereas in the original version the first four bars consist of an undifferentiated stream of quarter-notes and make up a single phrase, Geminiani&#x27;s version has three sequential repetitions of a distinctive one-bar phrase and a contrasted closing phrase, producing a strongly accented down-beat quality.&quot;

Jazz arrangers frequently develop variations on themes by other composers. For example, Gil Evans&#x27; 1959 arrangement of George Gershwin&#x27;s song &quot;Summertime&quot; from the opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; is an example of variation through changing orchestral timbre. At the outset, Evans presents a single variation that repeats five times in subtly differing instrumental combinations. These create a compelling background, a constantly-changing sonic tapestry over which trumpeter Miles Davis freely improvises his own set of variations. Wilfrid Mellers (1964) wrote that &quot;[i]t called for an improviser of Davis&#x27;s kind and quality to explore, through Gil Evans&#x27; arrangement, the tender frailty inherent in the &#x27;Summer-time&#x27; tune... Between them, solo line and harmonic colour create a music that is at once innocent and tense with apprehension&quot;.

==Variation form==
Variation forms include ground bass, passacaglia, chaconne, and theme-and-variations. Ground bass, passacaglia and chaconne are typically based on brief ostinato motifs providing a repetitive harmonic basis and are also typically continuous evolving structures. Theme-and-variation forms are, however, based specifically on melodic variation, in which the fundamental musical idea, or theme, is repeated in altered form or accompanied in a different manner. Theme-and-variation structure generally begins with a theme (which is itself sometimes preceded by an introduction), typically between eight and thirty-two bars in length; each variation, particularly in music of the eighteenth century and earlier, will be of the same length and structure as the theme. This form may in part have derived from the practical inventiveness of musicians; &quot;Court dances were long; the tunes which accompanied them were short. Their repetition became intolerably wearisome, and inevitably led the player to indulge in extempore variation and ornament&quot;; however, the format of the dance required these variations to maintain the same duration and shape of the tune.

Variation forms can be written as free-standing pieces for solo instruments or ensembles, or can constitute a movement of a larger piece. Most jazz music is structured on a basic pattern of theme and variations.

Examples include John Bull&#x27;s &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot;, Bach&#x27;s &quot;Canonic Variations on &quot;Vom Himmel hoch da komm&#x27; ich her&quot;, &quot;Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor&quot;, Violin &quot;Chaconne&quot;, and (D minor solo violin suite), Corelli&#x27;s &quot;La Folia Variations&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot;, the Finales of his Third &quot;Eroica&quot; and Ninth &quot;Choral&quot; Symphonies, the Finale of Brahms&#x27;s Fourth Symphony, &quot;Variations on a Theme of Haydn&quot;, Op. 56, Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Enigma Variations&quot;, Franck&#x27;s &quot;Variations Symphoniques&quot;, and Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Both Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; Quartet and &quot;Trout&quot; Quintet take their titles from his songs used as variation movements.

Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Berceuse&quot; for piano, Op. 57, was first called &quot;Variantes&quot;, and consists of 16 continuous variations on a ground bass.

==History of variations==
Although the first isolated example emerged in the 14th century, works in theme-and-variation form first emerge in the early sixteenth century. Possibly the earliest published example is the &quot;diferencias&quot; for vihuela by Luis de Narváez (1538). A favorite form of variations in Renaissance music was &quot;divisions&quot;, a type in which the basic rhythmic beat is successively divided into smaller and smaller values. The basic principle of beginning with simple variations and moving on to more elaborate ones has always been present in the history of the variation form, since it provides a way of giving an overall shape to a variation set, rather than letting it just form an arbitrary sequence.

Keyboard works in variation form were written by a number of 16th-century English composers, including William Byrd, Hugh Aston and Giles Farnaby. Outstanding examples of early Baroque variations are the &quot;ciaccone&quot; of Claudio Monteverdi and Heinrich Schütz. Two famous variation sets from the Baroque era, both originally written for harpsichord, are George Frideric Handel&#x27;s &quot;The Harmonious Blacksmith&quot; set, and Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations, BWV 988&quot;.

In the Classical era, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote a great number of variations, such as the first movement of his Piano Sonata in A, K. 331, or the finale of his Clarinet Quintet. Joseph Haydn specialized in sets of double variations, in which two related themes, usually minor and major, are presented and then varied in alternation; outstanding examples are the slow movement of his Symphony No. 103, the &quot;Drumroll&quot;, and the Variations in F minor for piano, H XVII:6.

Ludwig van Beethoven wrote many variation sets in his career. Some were independent sets, for instance the &quot;Diabelli&quot; Variations, Op. 120, and the &quot;Eroica&quot; Variations in E major, Op. 35. Others form single movements or parts of movements in larger works, such as first movement of the Piano Sonata No. 12, Op. 26, or the variations in the final movement of the Third Symphony (&quot;Eroica&quot;). Variation sets also occur in several of his late works, such as the slow movement of his String Quartet No. 12, Op. 127, the second movement of his final Piano Sonata No. 32, Op. 111, and the slow third movement of the Ninth Symphony, Op.125.

Franz Schubert wrote five variation sets using his own lieder as themes. Amongst them is the slow movement of his string quartet &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; D. 810, an intense set of variations on his somber lied (D. 531) of the same title. Schubert&#x27;s Piano Quintet in A (&quot;The Trout&quot;, D. 667) likewise includes variations on his song &quot;The Trout&quot; D. 550. The second movement of the Fantasie in C major comprises a set of variations on &quot;Der Wanderer&quot;; indeed the work as a whole takes its popular name from the lied.

In the Romantic era, the variation form was developed further. In 1824, Carl Czerny premiered his Variations for piano and orchestra on the Austrian National Hymn &quot;Gott erhalte Franz der Kaiser&quot;, Op. 73. Frédéric Chopin wrote four sets for solo piano, and also the Variations on &quot;La ci darem la mano&quot; from Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, Op. 2, for piano and orchestra (1827). Charles-Valentin Alkan wrote multiple variations in his early works. A further example of the form is Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Variations sérieuses&quot;.

Johannes Brahms wrote a number of sets of variations; some of them rely on themes by older composers, for example the Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel (1861; piano), and the Variations on a Theme by Haydn (1873; orchestra). The latter work is believed to be the first set of variations for orchestra alone that was a work in its own right, rather than part of a symphony, suite or other larger work. Karl Goldmark&#x27;s &quot;Rustic Wedding Symphony&quot; (1875) starts out with a set of variations as its first movement. Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot; (1877) and Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Enigma Variations&quot; (1899) are other well-known examples. Anton Arensky&#x27;s &quot;Variations on a Theme by Tchaikovsky&quot; (1894) is among his most popular compositions.

Variation sets have also been composed by notable twentieth-century composers, including

* Sergei Rachmaninoff (&quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot; for piano and orchestra, and his variations for solo piano on themes by Chopin and Corelli), 
* Charles Ives (&quot;Variations on &quot;America&quot;&quot;, 1891), 
* Ernst von Dohnányi (Variations on a Nursery Tune for piano and orchestra, Op. 25, 1914), 
* Arnold Schoenberg (Variations for Orchestra, Op. 31, and Theme and Variations, Opp. 43a and 43b), 
* Igor Stravinsky (&quot;Pulcinella&quot;: XV Gavotta con due variazioni, 1920; Octet: II Tema con variazioni, 1922; &quot;Ebony Concerto&quot;: III, 1945; and &quot;Variations: Aldous Huxley in memoriam&quot;, 1963–64),

An unusual option was taken in 1952 with the Variations on an Elizabethan Theme, a set of six variations on Sellenger&#x27;s Round for string orchestra, in which each variation was written by a different composer: Lennox Berkeley, Benjamin Britten, Arthur Oldham, Humphrey Searle, Michael Tippett, and William Walton.

Graham Waterhouse composed a trio &quot;Gestural Variations&quot; in 1997 and &quot;Variations for Cello Solo&quot; in 2019, and Helmut Lachenmann composed a trio &quot;Sakura-Variationen&quot; on the Japanese song in 2000.

A significant sub-set of the above consists of variations on a theme by another composer.

==Improvised variations==
Skilled musicians can often improvise variations on a theme. This was commonplace in the Baroque era, when the da capo aria, particularly when in slow tempo, required the singer to be able to improvise a variation during the return of the main material. During this period, according to Nicholas Cook, it was often the case that &quot;responsibility for the most highly elaborated stage in the compositional process fell not upon the composer but upon the executant. In their instrumental sonatas composers like Corelli, Geminiani, and Handel sometimes supplied the performer with only the skeleton of the music that was to be played; the ornamentation, which contributes crucially to the music&#x27;s effect, had to be provided by the performer.&quot; Cook cites Geminiani&#x27;s elaboration of Corelli (see above) as an example of an instance &quot;in which the composer, or a performer, wrote down a version of one of these movements as it was meant to be played.&quot;

Musicians of the Classical era also could improvise variations; both Mozart (see Mozart&#x27;s compositional method) and Beethoven made powerful impressions on their audiences when they improvised. Modern listeners can get a sense of what these improvised variations sounded like by listening to published works that evidently are written transcriptions of improvised performances, in particular Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia in G minor&quot;, Op. 77, and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Variations on an Aria by Gluck&quot;, K. 455.

Improvisation of elaborate variations on a popular theme is one of the core genres of jazz. According to William Austin, the practice of jazz musicians &quot;resembles the variations on popular songs composed for the keyboard at the end of the 16th century by Byrd, Bull, Sweelinck and Frescobaldi, more than the cumulative variations of Beethoven and Brahms.&quot; Generally, the theme used is stated quite explicitly at the outset. However, some jazz musicians employ a more oblique approach. According to Gamble, &quot;Charlie Parker&#x27;s performance of &quot;Embraceable You&quot; can be appreciated fully only if we are familiar with the tune, for unlike many jazz performances in which the theme is stated at the beginning, followed by improvisations on the theme, Parker launches almost immediately into improvisation, stating only a fragment of the tune at the end of the piece.&quot; Coleman Hawkins&#x27; famous interpretation of &quot;Body and Soul&quot; shows a similar approach. &quot;On 11 October 1939, Coleman Hawkins went into New York&#x27;s RCA studios with an eight-piece band to record the 1930 composition Body and Soul. It was already a favourite among jazz musicians, but nobody had ever played it like this. Pianist Gene Rodgers plays a straight four-bar introduction before Hawkins swoops in, soloing for three minutes without playing a single note of the tune, gliding over the chord changes with such harmonic logic that he ends up inventing bebop.&quot;

Improvisation by means of spontaneous variations, ornaments, embellishments and/or alterations to a melody is the basis of most sub-Saharan African music (traditional and pop) extending from melody and harmony to form and rhythmic embellishments.

<text>Maputo Province is a province of Mozambique; the province excludes the city of Maputo (which comprises a separate province). The province has an area of and a population of 1,968,906 (2017 census). Its capital is the city of Matola.

==Geography==

Maputo Province is the southernmost province of Mozambique. It borders Gaza Province to the north, the Indian Ocean to the east, the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal to the south, Eswatini to the southwest, and the Mpumalanga province of South Africa to the west and northwest. The Maputo Bay area to the southeast of Maputo is an important conservation area with many reefs and lakes. Of particular note is the Maputo Elephant Game Reserve, which has lakes such as Lagoa Chingute and Lagoa Piti in the vicinity, and the Machangulo Private Nature Reserve further north of this in the Machangulo Peninsula. The largest river of the province, the Maputo River, running from Amsterdam, Mpumalanga in South Africa near the Eswatini border, flows into Maputo Bay to the southeast of Maputo. Also flowing into the bay are the Umbeluzi River and the Incomati River. In the fall of 1999, the Maputo, Umbeluzi, Incompati and Limpopo rivers were affected by severe rainfall, 70 percent higher than normal which caused severe flooding. The Maputo and Incomati burst their banks on 12 January 2000, directly affecting some 40,000, and flooding along the Incomati affected about 20,000 several days later.

To the north of the peninsula is the Inhaca Island (&quot;Ilha da Inhaca&quot;), a subtropical island, about from north to south by from east to west which separates Maputo Bay to the west from the Indian Ocean off its eastern shores. It is protected under the Lubombo Transfrontier Conservation Area, and contains the Reserva da Inhaca. The highest point of the island is Mount Inhaca at on the north-eastern shoreline.

In the northwest of the province, near the South African border is a major reservoir and dam complex, the Corumana Dam, which dams the Sabie River. In 2014 it was reported that hydro-mechanical specialists have been consulted to see a further expansion of the complex, with the aim of increasing the height of the dam from to , and installing crest spillway gates and a fuse plug. The dam is under the responsibility of the water directorate, Direcção Nacional de Águas (DNA).

and the municipalities of:

<text>Elim Garak ( ) is a fictional character from the television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, in which he is portrayed by Andrew J. Robinson.

In the series, Garak is an exiled spy from the Cardassian Union and a former member of the feared Cardassian intelligence group called the Obsidian Order. Garak was exiled to the space station that became known as &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; and established a tailoring business there. While during most episodes of the series, he is indeed a harmless tailor, he is also a complex character whose portrayal often hints at hidden secrets and back-story, and he displays competence in a wide range of skills and knowledge in a crisis. Garak sometimes willfully or coincidentally plays a role in covert operations on the side of the United Federation of Planets running &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. Occasionally, other Cardassians warn Federation personnel that he is &quot;a very dangerous man with a traitorous mind&quot;, but in general he plays a rather positive, though sometimes sinister or multilayered, role during the series.

From a production standpoint, Garak&#x27;s character was expanded from a planned one-time appearance into a pivotal and complex character. Robinson&#x27;s portrayal of Garak also prompted discussion about his character&#x27;s sexuality, with Robinson describing Garak as omnisexual while others interpreted him as gay or bisexual.

==Role==
Garak is introduced in the second episode of the first season of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;Past Prologue&quot;. He appears in the replimat on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, where he introduces himself to the station&#x27;s doctor, Julian Bashir, as Garak, a tailor exiled from Cardassia. In the same episode, it is discovered that Garak was known as &quot;The Spy&quot; to the crew of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, as the only Cardassian left on the station after Cardassia ended their occupation of the nearby planet, Bajor.

Garak often denied involvement with the feared Cardassian intelligence agency, the Obsidian Order, only later to reveal a likely connection. As Garak&#x27;s friendship with Bashir develops, it is revealed that he was one of the Obsidian Order&#x27;s highest ranking operatives, and that he was exiled from Cardassia for unspecified reasons. It is suggested that his exile resulted from either letting prisoners escape during the occupation of Bajor, or the betrayal of Enabran Tain, head of the Order, who is later revealed to be Garak&#x27;s resentful biological father. Garak&#x27;s secrecy keeps him a character of interest and importance; he later uses his contacts with Cardassia and his training in the Obsidian Order to assist the Federation in the war against the Dominion. Garak appears in 37 of the 176 episodes of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, including the series finale, and appears in each of the seven seasons.

==Portrayal==

Garak was intended to be a one-off character; Robinson said that he portrayed the character in the episode for the simple fact that he needed money for that month to pay his bills. The producers were impressed with Robinson&#x27;s performance and decided to develop the character after Robinson agreed to return. The decision to incorporate Garak into more of the series led to Garak becoming a pivotal character—transforming him into a character of importance with unusual complexity and resonance.

Robinson&#x27;s initial performance as Garak received scrutiny as his portrayal was interpreted as Garak being homosexual or bisexual. In particular, Robinson portrayed Garak as having sexual interest in Bashir, and he used that as character motivation as an actor. Robinson denied that his portrayal was intended to portray Garak as homosexual and stated that he was omnisexual. As a result of the controversy, Robinson removed the particular characteristic from Garak.

Garak changes from a simple mysterious character to one of complexity and secrecy. Robinson stated that the complexity of Garak&#x27;s character did not come from his lies, but rather his refusal to elaborate on himself.

Producer and showrunner Ira Behr said that the character was gay, &quot;Garak was clearly gay. I mean, everyone knew it.&quot; Behr said the character was played as such but was not openly declared because the studio would not have approved. Writer Robert Hewitt Wolfe, who wrote a number of episodes with Garak in them, has also stated he wrote the character as gay or bisexual and that &quot;it would not be wrong to interpret Garak as bisexual.&quot;

In the 2024 episode &quot;Fissure Quest&quot;, of the series &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot;, a Garak and a sentient hologram Bashireach from different alternate universesare a married couple in the canon &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

==Character overview==

Garak has a long-standing antagonistic relationship with the prefect of Bajor, Gul Dukat. In the episode &quot;Civil Defense&quot;, Dukat states that it was a mistake for his father to have once trusted Garak and later in &quot;For the Cause&quot;, it is revealed that Garak had Dukat&#x27;s father tortured and killed. During the occupation of Bajor, Garak was a Gul serving the Cardassian mechanized infantry, or so Garak tells Bashir during the episode &quot;The Wire&quot;. The episode &quot;The Die is Cast&quot;, in which Garak was (briefly) reinstated to the Obsidian Order, there is mention of an incident with Dukat and Garak that involved an arms merchant, with Garak admitting he plans to kill Dukat when he returns to Cardassia. Later, Garak fell from grace and was exiled from Cardassia. He fled to the Cardassian space station Terok Nor when the Cardassians withdrew from the station, leaving it to the Federation and Bajorans. The reasons for Garak&#x27;s exile were never stated explicitly. In &quot;The Wire&quot;, a delirious Garak gave three contradictory stories for his exile: first that he had killed some escaping Bajoran prisoners in the last days of the occupation but in the process also killed the daughter of a powerful Cardassian military official; then that he actually took pity on some Bajoran children and allowed them to escape; and finally that he had been framed by his best friend Elim, for letting Bajoran prisoners escape. The name he gives as his friend &quot;Elim&quot;, is actually his own first name, which the others did not know while he was telling the story. In &quot;Improbable Cause&quot;, Garak&#x27;s former mentor Enabran Tain plainly accuses him of betraying Cardassia, but no details are given.

Garak&#x27;s character is elaborated upon when his childhood abuse is revealed. Garak, whose father, Enabran Tain, was the head of the Obsidian Order, is seen to have an acute form of claustrophobia as an adult. His claustrophobia is strongly suggested to have resulted from his father locking him in a closet as punishment for him not doing his chores, often for hours at a time, possibly exacerbated by an incident as an adult where he may have been trapped in a collapsing building. In &quot;Afterimage&quot;, Garak only overcomes an acute attack of this condition with the help of Ezri Dax who was newly posted to &quot;DS9&quot; as the station&#x27;s psychologist when she helps him understand and accept his feelings of guilt over his role in the current war, including decoding Cardassian messages for the Federation.

To gain his father&#x27;s approval, Garak followed in his footsteps and joined the Obsidian Order; at one point, he was stationed on Romulus working as a gardener in the Cardassian embassy as his cover (and was likely involved in the deaths of several Romulan officials), until the Cardassians stationed him on occupied Bajor. In his role as an agent of the Obsidian Order, it is suggested that Garak was one of the most skilled operatives within the organization, with a particular talent for interrogation—both physical and psychological. Garak has shown ability in hand-to-hand combat, computer programming and repair, piloting and code breaking. These talents came to the forefront on many occasions and Captain Sisko made use of them by recruiting Garak to work with Federation personnel, especially during the Dominion War. In &quot;A Time to Stand&quot;, Garak worked with a Starfleet detachment commanded by Captain Sisko during a mission to destroy a vital Jem&#x27;Hadar supply depot.

In the third season of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, during the Romulan–Cardassian attempt to destroy the Founders&#x27; home world, Garak is given the opportunity to return home by proving himself to Tain as a trustworthy operative of the Obsidian Order. Garak is assigned to interrogate and torture &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;&#x27;s chief of security, Odo, whose people had founded the Dominion. Although reluctant, Garak agrees, to demonstrate his loyalty to Tain and to prevent anyone else from taking the assignment. During the interrogation, Garak is surprised to discover that he no longer has the stomach for cold-blooded torture and horrified with how far he takes it before Odo reveals his secret (which is ultimately irrelevant to their mission anyway). Garak returns to &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; with Odo after apologizing to him and the two form a unique bond after realizing that they were more alike than they had originally thought, both longing to return home to their people but forced into exile. Later, during “In Purgatory&#x27;s Shadow”, when Garak goes with Worf to the Gamma Quadrant to try to find surviving members of the failed attack on the Founders, a dying Tain admits before witnesses that he is Garak&#x27;s father, including the depth of his feelings (&quot;I should have killed your mother before you were born. You have always been a weakness I can&#x27;t afford.&quot;), finally telling Garak that he is proud of him as his son.

In the final two seasons, Garak shifted his loyalties completely towards the Federation, primarily because his old political rival, Gul Dukat, seized control of Cardassia and aligned it with the Dominion. Garak uses his knowledge to assist the Federation in its war against the Dominion and Cardassia. With Sisko, Garak tricked the Romulans into entering the Dominion War on the Federation side by forging evidence of a high level Dominion meeting to plan the invasion of Romulus and then planting a bomb on the shuttle of a Romulan senator, when he concludes that the evidence was forged. Garak developed serious psychological trauma knowing that he had contributed to the deaths of his fellow Cardassians, a condition that Ezri Dax in her first case as Counsellor was able to treat to a manageable degree. Towards the end of the war Garak served as a Federation liaison to Legate Damar and his Cardassian rebellion against the Dominion, along with the Bajoran Kira Nerys. In retaliation for the rebellion, the Dominion killed 800 million Cardassians. As a result of the war, and the liberation of Cardassia from Dominion control, Garak&#x27;s exile ends.

In &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; season 5, an alternate reality version of Garak serves aboard the &quot;Defiant&quot;-class &quot;Anaximander&quot; as a surgeon. He has also married a Julian Bashir from a different alternate reality.

===Post-TV series novels===
In the novel &quot;A Stitch in Time&quot; (2000) (), written by Andrew Robinson, Garak&#x27;s life is further explored. The novel focuses on a letter from Garak to Bashir and shows that Garak has become involved in the political and social rebuilding of Cardassia. In the short story &quot;The Calling&quot; within the book &quot;Prophecy and Change&quot; (), his story continues.

In the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; novel &quot;The Never-Ending Sacrifice&quot; (2009), Garak is shown to have become Cardassian Ambassador to the United Federation of Planets. In the novel &quot;Mere Mortals&quot;, part of the &quot;Star Trek: Destiny&quot; trilogy, Garak is summoned to an emergency meeting by Federation President Nanietta Bacco. Bacco had called the unprecedented meeting because the Borg had launched an invasion of local space with the intention to completely wipe out all sentient threats. After some territorial concessions, Garak agreed to attempt to convince the Castellan (head of state) of the Cardassian Union to contribute ships to a massive allied response to the Borg.

In the novel &quot;The Crimson Shadow&quot; (2013), part of the &quot;Star Trek: The Fall&quot; miniseries, the &quot;Enterprise-E&quot; transports Ambassador Garak back home to Cardassia in order to oversee Starfleet&#x27;s final withdrawal from Cardassian space. However, the expected mere formality in Federation-Cardassian relations attracted the attention of Cardassian terrorists who were involved in the assassination of Federation President Bacco. At the end of the novel, Garak decides to run for the office of Castellan, and goes on to win.

==Personality==
Outwardly, Garak is gregarious and polite, traits that he uses to obscure people&#x27;s knowledge, or suspicion, of his work as a spy. Despite his image of an optimistic and well-mannered being, he is widely known to be deceitful, even to those whom he considers to be &quot;friends&quot;; e.g., Doctor Julian Bashir. Garak is secretive, often creating elaborate stories about himself to avoid scrutiny about his exile. As his father Tain once said of him, one of Garak&#x27;s basic philosophies is &quot;Never tell the truth when a lie will do.&quot; He once explained his belief that &quot;the truth is usually just an excuse for a lack of imagination.&quot; At one point, Doctor Bashir told him the story of &quot;The Boy Who Cried Wolf&quot; and upon hearing the moral (&quot;no one believes a liar when he is telling the truth&quot;), Garak insisted that the true moral was, &quot;you should never tell the same lie twice&quot;.

In the episode &quot;Favor the Bold&quot;, Bashir accuses him of being a pessimist and he defends himself by asserting: &quot;I always hope for the best. Experience, unfortunately, has taught me to expect the worst.&quot; On several occasions, when an otherwise trusting or idealistic character expresses a lack of trust in him, he reacts positively, remarking &quot;there may be hope for you yet&quot;.

Garak on numerous occasions is seen to have internal conflicts between his morals and his obligations to the Cardassian central command. Despite substantial evidence to suggest that he was an operative of the Obsidian Order, Garak on several occasions denies having ever been involved with the group, claiming he is just &quot;plain, simple Garak, a tailor on the Promenade&quot; and that his difficulties with the Cardassian government stem from tax evasion. He repeats this story frequently, even to people that he knows are aware of (some of) the truth about his past, and even those who are unaware of Garak&#x27;s past find the assertion to be dubious, at best.

==Mirror universe==
In the mirror universe Garak is a vicious and sadistic Gul in the Cardassian military. He was Intendant Kira&#x27;s second-in-command and resented her authority. Worf&#x27;s mirror universe counterpart personally blamed Garak for losing the Terok Nor station to a Terran (human) slave rebellion, although Garak blamed Kira and attempted to manipulate Worf into trying to get revenge on her.

Robinson reportedly disliked portraying this version of Garak, as he lacked any of his counterpart&#x27;s depth or complexity, instead serving as a mere treacherous minion. This quality was noted in his last appearance when Quark, Rom and Zek travelled to the Mirror Universe, Quark and Rom criticizing Mirror-Garak&#x27;s plans to simply kill them by talking about the elaborate lengths that their Garak would go to, resulting in Mirror-Garak being killed by the Mirror version of Ezri Tigan while he was distracted.

<text>Viscount Falkland is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. The name refers to the royal burgh of Falkland in Fife.

==History==
The title was created in 1620 by King James VI for Sir Henry Cary, a member of the Cary family. He was born in Hertfordshire and had no previous connection to Scotland. He was made Lord Cary at the same time, also in the Peerage of Scotland. His son, the second Viscount, was a prominent statesman. The latter&#x27;s younger son, the fourth Viscount (who succeeded his elder brother), notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire. His son, the fifth Viscount, represented several constituencies in the House of Commons and held office as First Lord of the Admiralty from 1693 to 1694. The Falkland Islands in the south Atlantic are named after him.

Upon his death, the line of the second Viscount failed and the titles were inherited by the fifth Viscount&#x27;s second cousin, the sixth Viscount. He was the grandson of the Hon. Patrick Cary, fifth son of the first Viscount. A lifelong adherent of the exiled Royal Family of Stuart, he was created Earl of Falkland in the Jacobite Peerage on 13 December 1722 by James Francis Edward Stuart (recognised by Jacobites as &quot;King James VIII / III&quot;). He also embraced the Roman Catholic faith. His great-great-grandson, the tenth Viscount, was a colonial administrator and Liberal politician. In 1832, he was created Baron Hunsdon, of Scutterskelfe in the County of York, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom (he was son-in-law of then King William IV). This title gave him an automatic seat in the House of Lords but became extinct on his death in 1884. The Scottish titles were inherited by his younger brother, the eleventh Viscount. He was an Admiral in the Royal Navy.

His nephew, the twelfth Viscount, sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1894 to 1922. He was succeeded by his son, the thirteenth Viscount, who also sat as a Representative Peer between 1922 and 1931. , the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the fifteenth Viscount, who succeeded his father in 1984. He was one of the ninety hereditary peers elected to remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999; he sat as a Crossbencher until his retirement in 2023.

Theoretically, all viscountcies in the Peerage of Scotland have &quot;of&quot; in their titles, but as with other British viscountcies, Scottish viscounts have dropped the practice of using &quot;of.&quot; The only exceptions to this usage are the Viscount of Arbuthnott and, to a lesser extent, the Viscount of Oxfuird.

There is a statue of Viscount Falkland in St Stephens Hall, in the Houses of Parliament. On 27 April 1909, a suffragette named Marjory Hume chained herself to the statue, shouting &quot;Deeds not words&quot;. When the chains were removed, the top half of the spur on Falkland&#x27;s right boot was broken off; the damage can be seen to this day. It is a common misconception that Falkland&#x27;s sword was broken during this incident. Instead, the sword broke shortly after the statue was installed in St Stephens Hall.

<text>The Subaru Baja is an all-wheel-drive, four passenger coupé utility manufactured from 2002 to 2006 by Subaru and marketed for model years 2003 to 2006. The Baja combines the handling and passenger carrying characteristics of a traditional passenger car with the open-bed versatility and load capacity of a very small pickup truck.

The unibody design borrowed heavily from the existing mechanicals, platform and sheet metal of the Subaru Legacy/Outback wagon. Production began on July 18, 2002 as a 2003 model at the Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc. factory in Lafayette, Indiana.

The name &quot;Baja&quot; derives from the Mexican peninsula of Baja California; home to the Baja 1000 off-road race.

== Design and engineering ==
Working with technical support from Subaru Japan, a team led by Peter Tenn, Subaru senior designer, penned the Baja in the United States. According to an August, 2002 interview with Tenn, &quot;the Baja&#x27;s jarring look is homage to rally-race trucks. It&#x27;s supposed to look funky, look different. It doesn&#x27;t fit any category, and we knew that going in. It&#x27;s not like anything else on the road. And that&#x27;s important to a lot of people.&quot;

The Baja followed closely Subaru&#x27;s ST-X (Sport Truck X-perimental) concept vehicle presented at the 2000 Los Angeles International Auto Show and also designed by a special Subaru America design team. The ST-X offered a greater complement of features than the production Baja (power rear window, under floor storage compartment, tailgate cup holders), but nevertheless set the production groundwork for an Outback-based, four-door, car-truck hybrid.

In a package longer than an Outback, the Baja featured a four-seater passenger compartment along with a open bed and drop-down tailgate. A system marketed as the &quot;Switchback&quot; allowed the rear passenger seat to fold down and a small hatch from the open bed to fold inward, allowing an extended length of around to the end of the open tailgate. A light in the instrument cluster signaled an &quot;open&quot; status for the Switchback. An optional bed extender was also offered that would extend the walls of the bed to the edge of the open tailgate. The design featured two stainless steel exposed buttresses behind the passenger compartment, marketed as &quot;Sports Bars&quot;, providing structural reinforcement for the open bed.

Features included tinted rear door windows and rear window; an integrated bed liner; a dual-illumination bed light; four bed tie-down hooks; molded-in recesses to receive standard 2x4&#x27;s to enable customized (e.g., bi-level) storage; standard roof rails with cross bars; a tow rating of , a rear seat center position rigid hinged storage compartment with integral twin cupholders, rear-seat power supply, rear-seat center storage net, map-pockets at rear of each front seat; an under-bed mounted spare tire, operable via a cable winch accessible from an access panel in the bed, and a fold-down license plate holder allowing the plate to be visible with the tailgate down.

== Marketing and sales ==

Subaru marketed the Baja in the United States, Canada and Chile. In the United States and Canada, Subaru marketed the Baja as a &quot;multiple-choice vehicle.&quot; Limited advertising, late arrival of the turbo-charged model, heavily styled lower-body plastic cladding and a yellow-and-silver introductory color scheme discouraged broad appeal. James Healey, writing for &quot;USAtoday&quot; at the time of the Baja&#x27;s introduction called it a &quot;controversial fashion statement with limited utility&quot;.

The Baja received the 2003 and 2004 J.D. Powers&#x27;s APEAL (for Automotive Performance, Execution and Layout Study) Award—measuring owner satisfaction with the design, content, layout and performance of their new vehicles for &quot;Most Appealing Compact Pickup&quot; and the &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; 2006 highest score for reliability in the pickup truck category.

With Subaru projecting to sell 24,000 per year, 30,000 were marketed over four and a half years.

Subaru discontinued Baja production in April 2006. Subaru stock-piled an inventory of 2006 models before discontinuing production, allowing dealers to continue to sell 2006 models as late as February 2008. The Baja was removed from the Subaru USA website on July 31, 2007, following its removal from the Subaru Chile website in April 2007.

In 2007, Subaru of America reached agreement with Toyota Motor Corporation allowing Subaru Indiana to manufacture Camrys to meet Toyota&#x27;s excess demand using surplus manufacturing capacity from its former Baja production line. 

== Model year changes ==
* 2003: the launch model featured leather seats, power driver&#x27;s seat, and sunroof. A lower priced &quot;Sport&quot; model, equipped with cloth interior and manually-adjustable seats followed later in the production year, also without color-keyed exterior door handles and mirrors, four-beam headlamps, leather shift and steering wheel, front door puddle lights or an illuminated ignition key ring.
* 2004: introduced a new 2.5-liter turbocharged model producing . This model featured &quot;Sportshift&quot; (a sport-mode automatic transmission),large hood scoop and color-matched exterior door handles and side mirrors. All models received increased ground clearance to .
* 2005: all models were given a further increase in ride height, a power outlet in the center console, rear seat back net pocket, and turbocharged models with leather offered a new tonneau bed cover.
* 2006: the turbocharged variant received an optional package that included leather trimmed upholstery, heated seats, special alloy wheels, a hard bed cover, and the sport-mode automatic transmission. All models received an enhanced security system.

<text>Wacholder is a juniper-flavored distilled beverage and a regional variety of gin. It is produced predominantly in Westphalia, Emsland, Lippe, and the Rhineland. One of the oldest operating Wacholder distilleries is the Brennerei Eversbusch in Hagen, founded in the 18th century. &quot;Wacholder&quot; is the German word for &quot;juniper&quot;.

In Austria and regions of Bavaria, Wacholder is referred to as &quot;Kranewitter&quot;, which is a regional term for the juniper plant. In Germany, Wacholder spirit can be used as an umbrella term for all juniper-flavored spirits such as Genever, Gin, Köm, Kranewitter, Krambambuli, and Steinhäger. A similar beverage, Borovička, is popular in Slovakia and the Czech Republic.

It is strong-flavored owing to its method of distillation, and is traditionally served chilled as a neat shot, with a beer chaser.

<text>In mathematics, two sets are almost disjoint if their intersection is small in some sense; different definitions of &quot;small&quot; will result in different definitions of &quot;almost disjoint&quot;.

==Definition==
The most common choice is to take &quot;small&quot; to mean finite. In this case, two sets are almost disjoint if their intersection is finite, i.e. if

:formula_1

(Here, &#x27;|&quot;X&quot;&amp;hairsp;|&#x27; denotes the cardinality of &quot;X&quot;, and &#x27;&lt; ∞&#x27; means &#x27;finite&#x27;.) For example, the closed intervals [0, 1] and [1, 2] are almost disjoint, because their intersection is the finite set {1}. However, the unit interval [0, 1] and the set of rational numbers Q are not almost disjoint, because their intersection is infinite.

This definition extends to any collection of sets. A collection of sets is pairwise almost disjoint or mutually almost disjoint if any two &quot;distinct&quot; sets in the collection are almost disjoint. Often the prefix &#x27;pairwise&#x27; is dropped, and a pairwise almost disjoint collection is simply called &quot;almost disjoint&quot;.

Formally, let &quot;I&quot; be an index set, and for each &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;, let &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; be a set. Then the collection of sets {&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; : &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;&amp;hairsp;} is almost disjoint if for any &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; in &quot;I&quot;,

:formula_2

For example, the collection of all lines through the origin in R2 is almost disjoint, because any two of them only meet at the origin. If {&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;} is an almost disjoint collection consisting of more than one set, then clearly its intersection is finite:

:formula_3

However, the converse is not true—the intersection of the collection 
:formula_4 
is empty, but the collection is &quot;not&quot; almost disjoint; in fact, the intersection of &quot;any&quot; two distinct sets in this collection is infinite.

The possible cardinalities of a maximal almost disjoint family (commonly referred to as a MAD family) on the set formula_5 of the natural numbers has been the object of intense study. The minimum infinite such cardinal is one of the classical cardinal characteristics of the continuum.

==Other meanings==
Sometimes &quot;almost disjoint&quot; is used in some other sense, or in the sense of measure theory or topological category. Here are some alternative definitions of &quot;almost disjoint&quot; that are sometimes used (similar definitions apply to infinite collections):

*Let κ be any cardinal number. Then two sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are almost disjoint if the cardinality of their intersection is less than κ, i.e. if
::formula_6
:The case of κ = 1 is simply the definition of disjoint sets; the case of
::formula_7
:is simply the definition of almost disjoint given above, where the intersection of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; is finite.

*Let &quot;m&quot; be a complete measure on a measure space &quot;X&quot;. Then two subsets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; of &quot;X&quot; are almost disjoint if their intersection is a null-set, i.e. if
::formula_8

*Let &quot;X&quot; be a topological space. Then two subsets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; of &quot;X&quot; are almost disjoint if their intersection is meagre in &quot;X&quot;.

<text>Madagascar was once divided into six autonomous provinces ():
#Antananarivo Province
#Antsiranana Province
#Fianarantsoa Province
#Mahajanga Province
#Toamasina Province
#Toliara Province
The provinces were dissolved following the regional subdivision and the constitutional referendum of 2007. A time frame of thirty months (until October 2009) was allowed for the transition. But in the 2010 constitution, six autonomous provinces were listed.

== History ==

The provinces were created in 1946, when Madagascar was a French colony. They were originally five, while the sixth (Diego Suarez/Antsiranana) was created later, but before the provincial elections in 1957. The same provinces continued to exist after the independence in 1960.

The new constitution of 1992 stated that the country should be divided into decentralised territorial entities, without going into detail. By law of 1994, three entity levels were defined: regions, departments and communes. The provinces were not mentioned in the law.

After former president Didier Ratsiraka was re-elected in 1997, he 1998 introduced a revised constitution in which the still existing provinces were transformed to &quot;autonomous provinces&quot;. Before that, no constitution had stated any details about the subdivisions of the country, leaving it to be ruled by law. The autonomous provinces were created in 2000. The official motivation was to make Madagascar a decentralised federal state. Critics say that the hidden motivation was to make sure that Ratsiraka had a solid support from most of the provinces; his party AREMA won the provincial elections 2000 in all provinces except Antananarivo.

With the presidential elections of 2001, in which opposition candidate Ravalomanana claimed that the official figures were fraudulent, the five AREMA provincial governors came out in support of Ratsiraka and even declared themselves independent from the republic.

When Ravalomanana had secured the position as president of the republic, the provincial governors were replaced with PDS&#x27;es (Presidents by special delegation), who are still in place. This effectively put an end to the &quot;autonomous provinces&quot;, although they nominally remain in place because they are included in the constitution.

Rumours about the dissolution of the autonomous provinces had been around for some time, when on 4 April 2007 a constitutional referendum was held, in which the majority of the voters backed a revised constitution without any provinces. The new regions will become the highest level of subdivision.

The years after independence 1960, Madagascar had a French-inspired division system.

During the second republic (1975–1991), Madagascar was divided into four levels of government:
# Faritany (province)
# Fivondronana (or fivondronampokontany)
# Firaisana (or firaisampokontany)
# Fokonolona (or fokontany)

Today, there are five different levels of division:
# Faritany mizakatena (autonomous province) (6)
# Faritra (region) (22)
# Fivondronana (district) (116)
# Kaominina (commune) (1,548)
# Fokontany (16,969)

The constitution of 1992 ruled that the country should be decentralized into territorial entities. The name, number, and limits of territorial entities should be determined by law. The law passed by the national assembly in 1994 defined three such entity levels: region (faritra), department (departemanta) and commune (kaominina). The communes were created in 1996. The existing provinces were not mentioned in the law.

With former president Didier Ratsiraka back in power, the constitution was amended in 1998, to include and specifically mention six autonomous provinces, divided into undefined regions and communes. The autonomous provinces, having the same names and territories as the already existing provinces, were created in 2000. Elections for the six provincial councils were held on 3 December 2000, resulting in an AREMA majority in all provinces except Antananarivo.

During the power struggle after the presidential elections in 2001, five of those provinces, whose governors supported Ratsiraka, declared themselves independent from the republic. The new president, Ravalomanana, replaced the provincial governments by special delegations, appointed by the president. This effectively means that the autonomous provinces have ceased to exist as such, and their dissolution is planned (see below).

In 2004, the regions were finally created by the national assembly in law number 2004-001. Meanwhile, the 28 regions originally proposed had become 22. Although they are subdivisions of the provinces, they are representatives (and representing the people) of the republic, not the province. The regions will also take over the assets of the &quot;ex-Fivondronampokontany&quot;. It is also mentioned that the communes are the only entities that are operational, and there will be an unspecified period of transition to the new system. The departments are not mentioned in the law, instead the designation &quot;components&quot; of the regions is used.

Also in 2004, the already existing Fokontany were redefined in the presidential decree 2004–299. They are subdivisions of the communes and headed by a chief designated by the mayor.

In 2005, a new entity called &quot;districts&quot; (distrika) was created by presidential decree 2005–012, replacing the department level of 1994. There are 116 districts. They have the same boundaries as the old &quot;Sous-préfectures&quot; or &quot;ex-Fivondronampokontany&quot;. They are defined as subdivisions of the regions, and contains one or more &quot;Arrondissements Administratifs&quot;. The chief of a district is designated by the chief of the region.

In the 2007 Constitution the autonomous provinces have been removed. Instead, the regions, the communes and the fokontany (but not the districts) are included. However, in the 2010 constitution, six autonomous provinces were re-listed.

<text>Daniel Rutherford (3 November 1749 – 15 November 1819) was a British physician, chemist and botanist who is known for the isolation of nitrogen in 1772.

==Life==

Rutherford was born on 3 November 1749, the son of Anne Mackay and Professor John Rutherford (1695–1779). He began college at the age of 16 at Mundell&#x27;s School on the West Bow close to his family home, and then studied medicine under William Cullen and Joseph Black at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with a doctorate (MD) in 1772. From 1775 to 1786 he practiced as a physician in Edinburgh.

On 12 April 1782 Rutherford was one of the founding members of the Harveian Society of Edinburgh and served as President in 1787. In 1783 he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1784 he was elected a member of the Aesculapian Club. At this time he lived at Hyndford Close on the Royal Mile a house he (or his father) had purchased from Dunbar Douglas, 4th Earl of Selkirk

He was a professor of botany at the University of Edinburgh and the 5th Regius Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh from 1786 to 1819. He was president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh from 1796 to 1798.

His pupils included Thomas Brown of Lanfine and Waterhaughs.

Around 1805 he moved from Hyndfords Close to a newly built townhouse at 20 Picardy Place at the top of Leith Walk, where he lived for the rest of his life.

He died suddenly in Edinburgh on 15 November 1819. His sister died two days later and the second sister (Scott&#x27;s mother) only seven days after the latter.

==Family==
He was the uncle of novelist Sir Walter Scott.

In 1786 he married Harriet Mitchelson of Middleton.

== Isolation of nitrogen ==

Rutherford discovered nitrogen by the isolation of the particle in 1772. When Joseph Black was studying the properties of carbon dioxide, he found that a candle would not burn in it. Black turned this problem over to his student at the time, Rutherford. Rutherford kept a mouse in a space with a confined quantity of air until it died. Then, he burned a candle in the remaining air until it went out. Afterwards, he burned phosphorus in that, until it would not burn. Then the air was passed through a carbon dioxide absorbing solution. The remaining component of the air did not support combustion, and a mouse could not live in it.

Rutherford called the gas (which we now know would have consisted primarily of nitrogen) &quot;noxious air&quot; or &quot;phlogisticated air&quot;. Rutherford reported the experiment in 1772. He and Black were convinced of the validity of the phlogiston theory, so they explained their results in terms of it.

<doc id="448277" wikidata="Q2454022" url="?curid=448277" title="Burnham-on-Crouch">
<text>Burnham-on-Crouch is a town and civil parish in the Maldon District of Essex, in the East of England; it lies on the north bank of the River Crouch. It is one of Britain&#x27;s leading places for yachting.

The civil parish extends east of the town to the mouth of the River Crouch. It includes the hamlets of Creeksea and Ostend west of the town; Stoneyhills to the north; and Dammer Wick, West Wick and East Wick east of the town.

==History==
According to the Domesday Book of 1086, Burnham was held in 1066 by a thegn called Alward and 10 free men. After 1066 it was acquired by a Norman called Tedric Pointel of Coggeshall whose overlord was Ralph Baynard.
Historically, it has benefited from its location on the coast – first as a ferry port, later as a fishing port known for its oyster beds, and most recently as a centre for yachting.

The parish church of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Burnham on Crouch is a large medieval church dedicated to St Mary the Virgin. The church is first recorded in 1155, when it was given to Little Dunmow Priory, and the Purbeck marble font dates from the twelfth century. The church&#x27;s unusual plaster barrel vault dates from 1775, after the previous roof was destroyed by fire in 1774.

There is also a United Reformed Church in Station Road in Burnham-on-Crouch. It was built in 1950 as the Congregational Church after its predecessor burnt down in 1946. The URC Church was formed when the Congregational church merged with the local Methodist church in 1984. Also on Station Road is the Baptist Church.

There are many listed buildings in the town, including the Grade II* listed Royal Corinthian Yacht Club designed in 1931 by the modernist architect Joseph Emberton. The Mangapps Railway Museum is located nearby.
Although the town has a population of little over 7,500, it is the principal settlement in the wider Dengie peninsula area (population 20,000), meaning it has facilities that are uncommon in small towns, such as a cinema, a laundrette, a post office, 22 licensed drinking establishments and three pharmacies.

Burnham played a significant role in both world wars. A First World War airfield was established in 1915 on agricultural land next to present-day Wick Farm. It was used until early 1919. It was established for use by Home Defence aircraft in order to defend against Zeppelin attack and as a night flight station. The small grass landing field covered an area of about 150 acres. There were no permanent buildings, and the personnel were billeted in tented accommodation. The base was initially established by the Royal Navy Air Service (RNAS) and two Bristol T.B.8s operated from there. The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) took over responsibilities for Home Defence in 1916 and the airfield became a RFC base operating BE type aircraft of 37 Squadron (50th Wing). The airfield was closed in 1919.

During the Second World War, Burnham was the training base for one of the first Commando battalions, led by Lt-Col Dunford-Slater. From 1943 to 1945 it was HMS St Mathew, base for up to 1400 sailors training on minor landing craft. The navy occupied the Royal Corinthian Yacht Club and a site at Creeksea. Unconnected with these activities, the area often witnessed Luftwaffe crashes and bomb, mine and V-weapon explosions – German parachute mines caused fatalities in the town and at nearby Southminster.

Since 1966 Burnham-on-Crouch has had an RNLI lifeboat presence. Initially it operated only during the sailing season, but from 1987 it has done so all year. The on-shore facilities are in the marina with two floating boathouses in Burnham yacht harbour.

==Society and culture==
Burnham-on-Crouch holds a bi-annual charity fund-raising pub crawl, an event which first took place in June 2007. Typically more than 100 local people walk through the town in themed fancy dress raising money for the Samaritans. There is both a summer and winter edition of the crawl.
On the last Saturday of September, the town holds its Illuminated Carnival, which was held for the 100th year in 2008. The carnival takes place on the High Street and Quay with stalls, sideshows and displays, and culminates with a grand illuminated procession in the evening, which leaves from the clock tower and proceeds around the town. There is also a fancy-dress competition for children. The carnival is sponsored by local businesses.

The Essex town is mentioned in the song &quot;Billericay Dickie&quot;, by Ian Dury. This song alludes to Burnham&#x27;s somewhat upmarket status in the county, with the invitation &quot;Oh golly, oh gosh, Come and lie on the couch, With a nice bit of posh, From Burnham-on-Crouch.&quot;

==Transport==

===Railway===

Burnham-on-Crouch railway station is a stop on the Crouch Valley Line, which runs between and . The branch line escaped the Beeching cuts, as it was used to supply the nearby Bradwell nuclear power station. The line was electrified in the 1980s.

Greater Anglia provides regular services to Wickford and Southminster, with direct services extending to and from London Liverpool Street during peak hours, thus allowing the town&#x27;s inclusion in the London commuter belt.

===Buses===
Bus services are operated by First Essex, Stephensons of Essex and Fords Coaches. Routes link the town with Chelmsford, Maldon, Latchingdon, South Woodham Ferrers and Southminster.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Sudbury and the local relay TV transmitters.BBC South East and ITV Meridian can also be received from either the Bluebell Hill or Dover TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Essex, Heart East, Radio Essex and Saint FM, a community based station which broadcast from the town.

The town is served by a local newspaper, the &quot;Maldon and Burnham Standard&quot;.

Burnham-on-Crouch hosts an annual sailing event known as Burnham Week, which takes place in the last week of August. The week includes competitive yacht and dinghy racing on the River Crouch. The event is shared among the four established sailing clubs in Burnham: The Royal Corinthian Yacht Club (linked to the sailing club with the same name in Cowes, Isle of Wight), The Royal Burnham Yacht Club, The Crouch Yacht Club, and The Burnham Sailing Club.

This annual yacht regatta dates back to 1893. In the early years, Burnham Week was regarded as the last event in the sailing calendar. In the days before marinas afforded year-round access, many yachts were laid up for the winter in mud-berths on the east coast rivers. The racing fleets worked their way along the south coast, enjoying various events and regattas, having a final fling at Burnham before laying up. Today, the event is still growing strongly and the various sailing clubs produce many highly regarded sailors. The week provides a range of competitive racing events as well as a full party programme.

===Other sporting activities===

Burnham-on-Crouch has a non-league football club Burnham Ramblers F.C., which plays at Leslie Fields.

There are rugby union, cricket and lawn bowls clubs, all of which compete at local, county and regional levels.

Burnham Golf Club, an 18-hole course, is at Creeksea, approximately 1.5 miles from the town centre.

<text>Manica is a province of Mozambique. It has an area of 62,272 km2 and a population of 1,945,994 (2017 census). The province is surrounded by Zimbabwe to the west, Tete Province to the northwest, Sofala Province to the east, the Save River to the south, and the Zambezi river to the northeast. Chimoio is the capital of the province. The highest mountain in Mozambique, Mount Binga (2436 m), lies in this province on the border with Zimbabwe. The Manica province is divided into nine districts and 34 administrative regions.

==History==
The province was located in the old Manica kingdom which probably existed since medieval times and existed until the 19th century. Several larger towns in the region were founded before the Portuguese arrival.

Later it came under Portuguese influence. The territory of the current province was part of the grant of the Mozambique Company, established in 1891. The territory came under direct control under the Portuguese colonial administration in 1942, the &quot;District of Beira&quot; was established, which came to be known as the &quot;District of Manica and Sofala&quot; in 1947.

On 5 August 1970, this district was divided into &quot;District Vila Pery&quot; (the old name of Chimoio) and &quot;District of Sofala&quot;. During the period of the transitional government (7 September 1974 to 25 June 1975) the District of Vila Pery was renamed &quot;Province of Vila Pery&quot; and later to its present name.

In 2008, when the incumbent president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe lost the first round of the presidential elections, violence broke out in the country. This forced large number of people to flee to Manica.

The province is headed by a provincial governor who is appointed by the President. Raimundo Diomba was the governor from 2005–07, Maurício Vieira from 2007 to 2010. Ana Comoana is the current provincial governor. Landmines are present in the province and deaths caused by them have been reported.

== Demographics ==
== Economy ==

The inhabitants practice subsistence farming. Main products are maize, cassava and goat meat. Agriculture is favoured by the high rainfall and mild climate. Cashews were once an important export product. Manica Province is rich in terms of gold, copper and base metal. Many farm workers from Zimbabwe have migrated to the province because of the conflicts in their country. The total number of such migrants is disputed and may range from 4,000 to 40,000.

==Districts==

Manica Province is divided into 12 districts:

*Báruè District
*Chimoio District
*Gondola District
*Guro District
*Macate District
*Machaze District
*Macossa District
*Manica District
*Mossurize District
*Sussundenga District
*Tambara District
*Vanduzi District
In 2013, the Mozambican government created Chimoio and Macate districts from portions of Gondola District, and Vanduzi District from portions of Manica and Gondola districts.

<doc id="448294" wikidata="Q2575465" url="?curid=448294" title="Crowle, Lincolnshire">
<text>Crowle is a market town in the civil parish of Crowle and Ealand, on the Isle of Axholme in the North Lincolnshire unitary authority of Lincolnshire, England. The civil parish had a population at the 2011 census of 4,828. The town lies on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal.

Notable buildings in the town include the parish church, in which can be seen the Crowle Stone runic cross shaft, and the Gothic revival market hall.

== History ==
Crowle is situated on one of a series of hills which form the Isle of Axholme, left exposed when the area emerged from the Glacial Lake Humber after the last Ice Age, and is separated from the main raised area to the south by a low-lying strip of land. The Isle of Axholme was formerly surrounded by several rivers, and much of the low-lying marshland was regularly inundated by water. The River Don flowed in a north-easterly direction just to the west of Crowle, to join the River Trent at Adlingfleet, but the hydrology of the area was radically altered in the seventeenth century, when Cornelius Vermuyden was appointed by Charles I to drain Hatfield Chase. Major rivers were diverted, and the numerous canals and drainage ditches that cross the fields give the whole area a Dutch character.

Archaeological evidence for early settlement suggests that there were occupation sites scattered throughout the area, rather than a village or town. There is evidence of Neolithic settlers in the form of stone axes and arrowheads, as well as the waste left by tool-making. Shards of Early Bronze Age pottery have been found, and in 1747, a hoard of spearheads and bronze rapiers were found on Crowle Moor, suggesting that settlement continued through the third, second and first millennia BCE. It continued through the Romano-British period, with finds in the parish suggesting a number of farmsteads, similar to those found in excavations at nearby Sandtoft during the construction of the M180 motorway. The grouping together of individual settlements to form a community probably took place in the Anglo-Saxon period.

The top of Mill Hill was used for arable farming from at least Roman times onwards. Field walking conducted between 2002 and 2004 on the east side of Mill Hill suggests that the arable farming was conducted down towards the 5 m contour. Below this point, the land was too damp and used for pasture. Below about 4 m, very little pottery was found. The land was too difficult to work until the invention of the tractor. The town had thirty-one fisheries recorded in the Domesday Book of the late 11th century. The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; recorded: &quot;Manor in Crule, Alwin had one oxgang less than six carucates to be taxed. Land to as many ploughs. Inland at Hubaldstorp. Now a certain Abbot of St. Germains in Selby has there under Geoffrey, one plough in the desmesne, and fifteen villanes and nineteen bordars, having seven ploughs, and thirty-one fisheries of thirty-one shillings. Thirty acres of meadow. There is a church, and wood and pasture one mile long and one mile broad. Value in King Edwards time £12, now £8. Tallaged at 40s.&quot; At the Conquest 1066, Crowle was the most populous and valuable manor in the Isle of Axholme. The Lord Paramount Geoffrey de Wirce, kept a demesne (Area of land) in his own hands. A carucate, approximately 240 acres, is the amount of land that can be worked by a plough team in a year. There are eight oxen in a plough team, hence the oxgang 30 acres.

The parish church building, dedicated to St Oswald, was built soon afterwards, with Norman architecture dating from the twelfth century evident in the south and west walls of the nave and the north wall of the chancel. Some earlier Saxon material was reused, including a decorated cross shaft, now in the west bay of the nave arcade. The decoration includes serpents, two flying dragons, two figures in conversation, a third figure on horseback, and a runic inscription. The building was modified and partially rebuilt in subsequent centuries, including a major restoration in 1884 by A S Ellis of London, and is now a Grade I listed structure, in recognition of its architectural merit. Crowle developed into a market town in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, with the support of the Abbot of Selby, and its first market charter was awarded in 1305.

The economy was agricultural, and included hunting and fishing. The surrounding peat fens was grazed intensively during the summer months, and Crowle common was managed by four grass-men, who controlled the grazing and charged those who brought stock to the common from other areas. During the winter, the stock was kept on higher ground or in yards, as much of the grassland was flooded between November and May. This had a beneficial effect, as water-borne alluvium improved the fertility of the soil. The flooded areas also supported fishing and fowling.

===Drainage===
Some improvements had been made to the water systems of the area by Selby Abbey, both for drainage and for navigation, but the effects of the drainage of Hatfield Chase by Vermuyden in the 1620s were much more significant. The scheme attempted to turn a productive marsh-based peasant economy into an arable system, but the way in which it was financed resulted in much of the reclaimed land being owned by Vermuyden and his adventurers, the Crown, or existing landowners. Many local people lost their livelihoods, as the common land was reduced from between to just . Although reclaimed arable land was offered back to local people for rent, they were stock farmers, and the meadow land and winter fodder were gone. There was widespread unrest throughout the area, particularly as the initial drainage was less than effective, resulting in flooding in both summer and winter, without the benefits of fertilising the soil. Winter fowling and fishing activity was reduced, although of land were eventually awarded to the people of Crowle in compensation for the loss of fisheries. Parts of Crowle were leased to Vermuyden in 1636 by Charles I, based on the original contract under which he got to own one third of the improved lands, but making a profit from the land holdings proved to be very difficult, and he quickly sold the land to the Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery and to Sir Richard Pye.

Between 1590 and 1640, forty new houses were built in the town, and this prosperity continued through the 17th and 18th centuries. It was supported by farming and fishing, by the cutting of peat on the moors, by the cultivation of flax and hemp, and by the production of sackcloth. Transport links were improved by the construction of the Stainforth and Keadby Canal between 1792 and 1802, which passed just to the south of Crowle, providing better access to the River Don and the River Trent. Warping of land became popular in the late 18th century, a process by which agricultural land was flooded by tidal water in a controlled way, so that the sediments it contained, known as warp, were deposited as the tide receded. If the system was well designed, some 2,300 tons per acre (5,800 tonnes per ha) could be deposited over the course of a year, creating new soil to a depth of . An inclosure act was obtained for Crowle in 1785, which specified that the enclosed land should be warped in this way. Crowle Manor was enclosed in 1813, and were warped, at a cost of , which was relatively costly.

===Development===
Crowle, together with the whole of the north Isle of Axholme, thrived in the 19th century. The production of sackcloth was improved by mechanisation, and there was a growth in milling, brewing and agricultural engineering. Other employment was available in a brick and tile works, located to the south of the town centre. The 1893 map shows four windmills in Crowle, one on Godnow Road and three on Mill Road. The growing of hemp in the district had ceased by 1839, to be replaced by flax. Crowle had a mill for processing the flax, which lasted until the early 20th century. It was located to the north of Chancery Lane. Some indication of the prosperity of the town in the late 19th century can be gained from the Market Hall (designed by William Hull) with its elaborate decoration. Crowle was one of the first in the area to have a gas works, which started producing gas in 1854. It was located on the corner of Cross Street and Windsor Road, and had a working capital of £1,800, raised by issuing £10 shares. The gas was used for street lighting. In 1905 there were two breweries in operation, James Fox &amp; Sons operating the one to the north of the town and John Dymond owning the New Trent Brewery.

During this period, the population increased steadily, from 1,343 in 1801 to 1,889 in 1831, 2,548 in 1851 and 3,122 in 1871. A Burial Board was created in 1862, and established a general cemetery on a long plot on Mill Lane, with two mortuary chapels. One of them is now used to store equipment for the maintenance of the cemetery. Education in 1872 was provided by a National School. The parish had been bequeathed three houses, which included common rights and of land, to be used for the education and relief of the poor. The houses were given by Richard Brewer in 1687, Thomas Walkwood in 1692 and Richard Clark in 1721. When the inclosure act was obtained, the land and common rights were consolidated, and the trustees received a little over of tithe-free land and £206, which was used to repair the houses. They were then rented out, and the Charity Commissioners later appropriated the income to fund the National School. Education was managed by a School Board from 1871. White&#x27;s Guide of 1872 includes a list of those engaged in trades and professions, and besides the National School, it lists nine other people under the Academies and Schools section, three of whom took in boarders. Farming was still a major occupation, as that section is much bigger than all the others, but a wide range of occupations are listed, some of which were pursued by women, including a Mrs Ann Bleasby, who was a blacksmith. Opportunities for paid work for the working classes were available at the Flax Mill, but the chief source of employment in 1894 was the harvesting of peat for the Peat Moss Litter Works.

Trade was further enhanced by the arrival of the railways. The Axholme Joint Railway opened on 2 January 1905, linking Crowle to in the north and in the south, where there was an interchange with the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway. A major feature of the railway was Crowle Swing Bridge, which carried it over the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. Construction involved moving of earth to form the embankments on either side of the main span. The opening section of the bridge was built by the Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company, who were based in Darlington. The northern approach, on the Crowle side of the canal, included three brick arches, crossing a minor road and a drainage ditch, a girder bridge which carried the line over the to line of the Great Central Railway, and a further brick arch.

In the mid twentieth century, the economy of Crowle declined somewhat, as there was a decline in agriculture, and the transport links which had once contributed to its success took trade away from it. Despite this, there was an expansion in the number of houses, with residential developments on Mill Hill, Wharf Road, Field Side and Godnow Road, and the construction of the M180 motorway, which skirts the southern edge of the town, provided quick access to major centres of employment and shopping.

On 12 May 2010 the civil parish was renamed from &quot;Crowle&quot; to &quot;Crowle &amp; Ealand&quot;.

==Schools==
The Axholme Academy is the main secondary school serving the town. Before 2012, when it became an academy, it was known as North Axholme School. In 1965, the school organised a historic trip along the Axholme Joint Railway, on which passenger services had been withdrawn in 1933. On 1 April, just 4 days before the railway finally closed, they hired a 4-coach diesel multiple unit, which ran from Goole, via to , and then back to Reedness Junction to reach . 184 pupils, with teachers and invited guests were joined by newspaper reporters and television cameramen for the trip. On the return journey, the train stopped at Ealand Siding and at Crowle for the passengers to get off. The whole journey took 4 hours, at an average speed of and an account of the trip, written by Mr B J Hastings, the geography teacher, was published in the &quot;Lincolnshire Transport Review&quot;. The academy had 29 teachers in 2015, and catered for 400 pupils aged 11 to 18. Primary education is available at Crowle Primary Academy, with 10 teachers and 264 pupils, and at the denominational Saint Norbert&#x27;s Catholic Primary Voluntary Academy, which has five teachers and 120 pupils.

==Religion==
Crowle had several churches in addition to the parish church of St Oswald. These include a Catholic church, dedicated to St Norbert, and non-conformist chapels belonging to the Baptists, Methodists, Primitive Methodists and Congregationalists. The Baptists were active in the town from 1599, and built a chapel at the junction of Eastoft Road and Fieldside in 1820. The original building was demolished in 1879, and a new one built in its place. Due to dwindling congregations, the chapel closed in July 2010, and was sold at auction in March 2011. The site includes a small graveyard, and covenants were put in place to ensure that relatives of those buried could still visit the graves. The Congregationalists built a chapel on the west side of Fieldside in 1880, which has since been converted as a furniture salesroom. The Methodist chapel is on the east side of Fieldside, and the present building dates from 1904. The Sunday School, built in 1888 on the west side of the road, has been converted into a residence. The Primitive Methodists built a chapel on Chapel Street in 1830, and in 1862 moved to a new building on Cross Street. Following closure in 1965, the building was used by various businesses, and was subsequently converted into five town houses.

During the mid-19th century, there was an influx of Irish labourers, and there was nowhere locally for them to receive Mass. The foreman at the gas works, an Italian called Girolamo Vaccari, who changed his name to James Walker, asked Thomas Young of Kingerby Hall, near Market Rasen for help to establish a Catholic community, but the Diocese felt that a new parish in such a remote area would not be viable. Young therefore invited the Canons Regular of Prémontré, a religious order founded by St Norbert, and then based in Antwerp, to live and work in Crowle. A church and an attached house in which the Canons lived was designed by M E Hadfield &amp; Son, who were based in Sheffield, built by George Sinclair, and paid for by Young. Work commenced in 1871, and the building was opened in 1872. A school was built in 1873, and both the church and the house were extended in 1874. A belfry, designed by the Clerk of Works at Lincoln Cathedral, was added in 1949. The canons later came from Tongerlo Abbey in Belgium, and the house ceased to be a priory in 1983.

==Facilities==
There are several community facilities including a Library, a Community Resource Centre, a Youth Centre, a Hall, and a British Legion Club. In 2015, North Lincolnshire Council bought the Market Hall, and converted it, so that it could be used by the youth service. The Youth Club moved there from their former base on Church Lane, which allowed the Boxing Club to expand its activities.

There are a number of retail shops in the town centre, although the economic downturn had resulted in there being several unoccupied shops in 2004. There are also several public houses on the High Street and Market Place. The &quot;White Hart Inn&quot; is a timber-framed, grade II listed building dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, which was subsequently encased and rebuilt in brick, and roughly rendered. An ability to inspect the timbers during building work in the 1980s suggested that it includes two adjoining timber-framed houses. It advertises itself as the oldest inn in the Isle of Axholme. The &quot;Cross Keys Inn&quot; is another grade II listed building, dating from the 18th century and rebuilt in 1832. A stone tablet built into a former carriage opening records this fact, and the structure includes a number of 16-pane and unusual 9-pane sash windows. By 2015 it had become a training centre. The other open pub is the &quot;Red Lion&quot;

==Media==
Television signals are received from either the Emley Moor or Belmont TV transmitters. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Humberside, Capital Yorkshire, Nation Radio East Yorkshire, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire, TX1 Radio, Hits Radio Lincolnshire, Hits Radio East Yorkshire &amp; North Lincolnshire, TMCR 95.3, and Steel FM, a community based online radio station which broadcast from its studio in Scunthorpe. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Doncaster Free Press&quot; (formerly &quot;Crowle Advertiser&quot;).

==Transport==
Crowle is served by buses provided by East Yorkshire and Hornsbys Bus &amp; Coach which gives the town services to towns of Scunthorpe and Goole.
The town is served by Crowle railway station on the South Humberside Main Line, which runs from Doncaster to Scunthorpe.

Crowle North railway station closed to passengers in 1933. It was on the Axholme Joint Railway, which ran from Goole to Lincoln via a connecting spur to the Doncaster to Lincoln Line. The line then closed to freight and excursion services in 1956 to Lincoln and in 1972 to Keadby Power Station as a siding. The site has been for redeveloped for housing, however the station house still survives as a private residence with the old trackbed being converted into a bridleway south towards Belton.
