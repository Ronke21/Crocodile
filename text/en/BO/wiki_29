<text>Yazd (; ) is a city in the Central District of Yazd County, Yazd province, Iran, serving as capital of the province, the county, and the district. At the 2016 census, its population was 529,673. Since 2017, the historical city of Yazd is recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

Because of generations of adaptations to its desert surroundings, Yazd is known for its Persian architecture. It is nicknamed the &quot;City of Windcatchers&quot; ( &quot;Shahr-e Badgirha&quot;) from its many examples. It is also very well known for its Zoroastrian fire temples, ab anbars (cisterns), qanats (underground channels), yakhchals (coolers), Persian handicrafts, handwoven cloth (&quot;Persian termeh&quot;), silk weaving, Persian cotton candy, and its time-honored confectioneries. Yazd is also known as City of Bicycles, because of its old history of bike riders, and the highest number of bicycles per capita in Iran. It is reported that bicycle culture in Iran originated in Yazd as a result of contact with European visitors and tourists in the last century.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Yazd&quot; means &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;holy&quot;; Yazd City means &quot;City of the Holy [One, &quot;i. e.&quot;, God]&quot;. Former names of this city: Kath, Isatis.

== History ==

Archeological evidence 12 kilometers north of Yazd suggests that the area has been populated since the period of the Achaemenid Empire (550 BC–330 BC). In his &quot;Natural History&quot;, Pliny the Elder (died 79 AD) mentions a town in the Parthian Empire (247 BC–224 AD) named &quot;Issatis&quot;, which is seemingly connected to the name of the Asagarta/Istachae/Sagartians. As a result, some scholars have suggested that the name of Yazd was derived from Issatis (also transliterated as Isatichae, Ysatis, Yasatis), and that the latter name started to be used in the Median or Achaemenid eras.

The area encompassing Yazd first started to gain prominence in the Late antiquity, namely under the Sasanian Empire (224–651). Under Yazdegerd I (), a mint was established in Yazd (under the mint abbreviation of &quot;YZ&quot;), which demonstrates its increasing importance. According to the New Persian chronicle &quot;Tarikh-i Yazd&quot; (&quot;History of Yazd&quot;) of 1441, Yazd was re-founded by &quot;Yazdegerd, son of Bahram&quot;, i.e. Yazdegerd II (). The word &quot;yazd&quot; means God. After the Muslim conquest, many Zoroastrians migrated to Yazd from neighboring provinces. By paying a levy, Yazd was allowed to remain Zoroastrian even after its conquest, and Islam only gradually became the dominant religion in the city.

Due to its secluded desert setting and challenging access, Yazd was mostly spared from major conflicts and the devastation and havoc of warfare. For instance, it was a haven for those fleeing from destruction in other parts of the Khwarazmian Empire during the Mongol invasion. In 1272 it was visited by Marco Polo, who remarked on the city&#x27;s fine silk-weaving industry. In the book &quot;The Travels of Marco Polo&quot;, he described Yazd in the following way:

Yazd briefly served as the capital of the Muzaffarid Dynasty in the fourteenth century, and was unsuccessfully besieged in 1350–1351 by the Injuids under Shaikh Abu Ishaq. The Friday (or Congregation) mosque, arguably the city&#x27;s greatest architectural landmark, as well as other important buildings, date to this period. During the Qajar Empire (18th century AD) it was ruled by the Bakhtiari Khans.

Under the rule of the Safavid Empire (16th century), some people migrated from Yazd and settled in an area that is today on the Iran-Afghanistan border. The settlement, which was named Yazdi, was located in what is now Farah City in the province of the same name in Afghanistan. Even today, people from this area speak with an accent very similar to that of the people of Yazd.

One of the notable things about Yazd is its family-centered culture. According to official statistics from Iran&#x27;s National Organization for Civil Registration, Yazd is among the three cities with the lowest divorce rates in Iran.

== Demographics ==
=== Language and ethnicity ===
The majority of the people of Yazd are Persians. They speak Persian with a Yazdi accent, which is different from the Persian accent of Tehran.

During the Pahlavi era, a large group of Kurds from the Gulbaghi tribe were moved from the north of Kurdistan province to the city of Yazd and the cities of Isfahan, Kashan, and Nayin. Today, the Gulbaghi tribe are mostly assimilated elements in the population of these cities.

=== Religion ===
The majority of people in Yazd are Shia Muslims. Yazd is a strongly religious, traditionalist and conservative city. Several city traditions are the Muslim parades and gatherings, which are mainly processions called &quot;azadari&quot; held to commemorate the events experienced by the main Islamic martyrs and other important figures. These huge public gatherings created a series of spaces which, since most are near important urban monuments, are used at other times as hubs from which visitors can tour the main spots in the city.

There is also a sizable population of Zoroastrians in the city. In 2013, Sepanta Niknam was elected to the city council of Yazd and became the first Zoroastrian councillor in Iran. The Pir-e-Naraki sanctuary is one of the important pilgrimage destinations for Zoroastrians, where an annual congregation is held and frequent visits are made during the year; it is now also a famous tourist spot. The story of the last Persian prince to come to Yazd before the arrival of Islam adds to its importance. Such a transformation has occurred several times.

There was once a relatively large Jewish-Yazdi community, however, after the creation of Israel, many have moved there for varying reasons. Former president of Israel Moshe Katsav is an example. 

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 423,006 in 114,716 households. The following census in 2011 counted 486,152 people in 141,572 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 529,673 people in 158,368 households.

==Geography==
=== Climate ===
Yazd has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;). It is the driest major city in Iran, with a yearly precipitation amount that is less than , and has only 11.5 days of precipitation. Summer temperatures are frequently above in blazing sunshine with low humidity, on 35.3 days per year the maximum daily temperature reaches or exceeds . Even at night the temperatures in summer are rather uncomfortable. In the winter, the days remain mild and sunny, but in the morning the thin air and low cloudiness cause cold temperatures, with 24.3 days per year in which the minimum temperature falls below .

Dust events are not uncommon in Yazd, as they happen 52 days per year. Thick haze is much more common (135.8 days annually) and is more frequent in winter.

== Historical sites==

Yazd is an important centre of Iranian architecture. Because of its climate, it has one of the largest networks of &quot;qanats&quot; (underground water supply systems) in the world, and Yazdi &quot;qanat&quot; makers are considered the most skilled in Iran.

To deal with the extremely hot summers, many old buildings in Yazd have magnificent wind towers and large underground areas.

The city is also home to prime examples of &quot;yakhchals&quot;, which were used to store ice retrieved from glaciers in the nearby mountains. Yazd is also one of the largest cities built almost entirely out of adobe.

Yazd&#x27;s heritage as a center of Zoroastrianism is also important. There is a Tower of Silence on the outskirts, and the city has an &quot;ateshkadeh&quot; which holds a fire that has been kept alight continuously since 470 AD. Zoroastrians make up a small minority of the population of Yazd, around 1,000 out of 600,000.

The 11th-century brick mausoleum and shrine Davāzdah Imām is the oldest dated building in the city.

Built in 12th century and still in use, Jame Mosque of Yazd is an example of the finest Persian mosaics and excellent architecture. Its minarets are the highest in the country. Tomb of Sayyed Rukn ad-Din is nearby the mosque.

== Economy ==
Always known for the quality of its silk and carpets, Yazd today is one of Iran&#x27;s industrial centers for textiles. There is also a considerable ceramics and construction materials industry and unique confectionery and jewellery industries. A significant portion of the population is also employed in other industries including agriculture, dairy, metal works, and machine manufacturing. There are a number of companies involved in the growing information technology industry, mainly manufacturing primary materials such as cables and connectors. Currently Yazd is the home of the largest manufacturer of fibre optics in Iran.

Yazd&#x27;s confectioneries have a tremendous following throughout Iran and have been a source of tourism for the city. Confectioners workshops (&quot;khalifehs&quot;, or experts) keep their recipes a guarded secret, and there are many that have remained a private family business for many generations. Baklava, ghotab and pashmak are the most popular sweets made in the city.

In 2000 the Yazd Water Museum opened; it features exhibits of water storage vessels and historical technologies related to water.

Yazd has expanded its industrial fields since the 1980s. With at least three main industrial areas each containing over 70 different factories, Yazd has become one of the most technologically advanced cities of Iran.

== Transportation ==
In addition to its connection with major Iranian cities via Iranian Railways, Yazd is served by the Shahid Sadooghi Airport.

<doc id="451387" wikidata="Q1206796" url="?curid=451387" title="Nishihara, Okinawa">
<text>is a town located in Nakagami District, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. In the Okinawan language, &quot;nishi&quot; means &quot;north&quot; (in standard Japanese, however, it means &quot;west&quot;), as Nishihara was north of the historical Ryukyuan capital of Shuri.

As of October 2016, the town had an estimated population of 34,463 and a density of 2,200 persons per km2. The total area is .

Situated northeast of the city hall of Naha, Nishihara is surrounded by the cities, towns, and villages of Naha, Urasoe, Ginowan, Haebaru, Yonabaru, and Nakagusuku.

Because both the University of the Ryukyus and the Okinawa Christian Junior College are located in Nishihara, and the Okinawa International University is located nearby, Nishihara&#x27;s municipal slogan is &quot;Education Town&quot;.

==Geography==

The north, west, and south of Nishihara are hilly; these areas give way to the low-lying coast in the east of the town.

The highest point in Nishihara is Untamamo (). The low-lying peak, also known as Untamamui in the Okinawan language, sits to the south of the town on the border of Nishihara and the neighboring town of Urasoe. Due to its pyramidal shape, the peak is sometimes known as the &quot;Nishihara Fuji&quot; for its resemblance to Mount Fuji. Untamamo has &quot;utaki&quot;, or places sacred to the Okinawan religion, on both the north and south sides of the peak. Untamamo was the site of fierce fighting during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II; the spontaneous combustion of unexploded ordnance caused numerous mountain fires in the post-war period.

===Administrative divisions===
The town includes twenty-two wards.

==History==

Nishihara was part of the Nishibaru magiri, one of the &quot;magiri&quot;, or administrative units created prior to the establishment of the Ryukyu Kingdom. The &quot;magiri&quot; was administered from the former village of Kōchi; in a later period the administrative center was located in the former village of Unaga.

Nishihara flourished as a center of sugar manufacturing at the beginning of the 20th century. The Japanese government promoted the construction of sugar refineries in the village. In 1944 the Imperial Japanese Army built a military airstrip in the Onaha district of Nishihara; the area was bombed by the United States on October 10 of the same year, causing extensive damage to Onaha. It was near the village of Nishihara that the U.S. 1st Marine Division reached its initial invasion objective on April 4, 1945 during the Battle of Okinawa. The entirety of Nishihara was destroyed as a front line in the battle, and its residents fled to the north and south of Okinawa Island. However, 47% of the population of Nishihara was ultimately killed during World War II.

The Gaja district of Nishihara was the center of initial post-war reconstruction. Rice was planted immediately after the war, but this was soon replaced by the sugarcane cultivation of the prewar period. Nishihara saw the development of business enterprises and residential land development in the mid-1960s; by 1979 the population of Nishihara had increased to the point that the village was elevated to town status. The urbanization of the town continues due to the presence of university facilities and residential developments.

<doc id="451388" wikidata="Q1206950" url="?curid=451388" title="Shimajiri District, Okinawa">
<text>is a district located in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. 

== Etymology ==
Modern translation of Shimajiri means &quot;Butt of the island&quot; which may refer to its southerly position on the island of Okinawa. Compare this to Kunigami District, Okinawa.

However, there are hundreds of geographic references throughout Japan and even into the northern Kuriles using &quot;shiri&quot;, to approximate the &quot;Ainu&quot; word &quot;shir&quot;, meaning &quot;island&quot;. Despite Okinawa being so far south, historically Jōmon culture was dominant as on the mainland, and words likely have survived, though their original meanings have long been lost or modified.

== Population ==
As of 2020, the district has an estimated population of 105,230 and the density of 447.98 persons per km2. The total area is 234.9 km2.

== Geography ==
The district also includes Kume Island, the islands of Iheya and Izena, the Kerama Islands, the Aguni Islands, and the Daitō Islands.

==Towns and villages==
*Haebaru Town
*Kumejima Town
*Yaese Town
*Yonabaru Town
*Aguni Village
*Iheya Village
*Izena Village
*Kitadaitō Village
*Minamidaitō Village
*Tokashiki Village
*Tonaki Village
*Zamami Village

==Mergers==

*On January 1, 2006 the town of Kochinda, and the village of Gushikami merged to form the new town of Yaese.
*On January 1, 2006 the town of Sashiki, and the villages of Chinen, Ōzato and Tamagusuku merged to form the new city of Nanjō.

<doc id="451389" wikidata="Q5119457" url="?curid=451389" title="Kochinda, Okinawa">
<text>was a town located in Shimajiri District, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 17,226 and the density of 1,164.71 persons per km2. The total area is 14.79 km2.

On January 1, 2006, Kochinda, along with the village of Gushikami (also from Shimajiri District), was merged to create the town of Yaese.

The Kochinda area is currently a place of change. Apartments are quickly replacing old businesses and old homes alike. This expansion is to lure people to the area from Naha and Haebaru with cheaper rent and quieter living. It is a small town with excellent schools, a city office, a grocery store, a few gas stations and a hardware store. The local area consists of farm fields, usually filled with sugar cane. It is quiet and clean.

<doc id="451390" wikidata="Q4598006" url="?curid=451390" title="2000 Year Old Man">
<text>The 2000 Year Old Man is a comedy sketch created by Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks in the 1950s and first publicly performed in the 1960s. Brooks plays a 2000-year-old man, interviewed by Reiner in a series of comedy routines that were turned into a collection of records and also performed on television.

==History==
The foundation for the routine was laid during production of &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, where Reiner was an actor and Brooks was a writer. Reiner describes the first instance:

It began as a joke between the two that was then shared at parties. Reiner started bringing a tape recorder to the parties as Brooks never said the same thing twice. Numerous people such as George Burns suggested to the two that they put their material on an album, but only Steve Allen managed to coax the two to come record it in his studio. Reiner recalls the moment he and Brooks realized the first album was going to be a hit:

==Sketch==
Reiner was the straight man, asking interview questions of Brooks, who would improvise answers in a Jewish-American accent. The free-wheeling semi-improvised sketches covered a wide variety of topics from marriage (&quot;I have been married several hundred times&quot;) and children (&quot;I have over 42,000 children and not one comes to visit me!&quot;) to transportation (&quot;What was the means of transportation then? Mostly fear.&quot;).

The quality of the sketch was elevated by the quick improvisational wit of Brooks, who would usually use a question as a springboard to unplanned exposition and tangents that would be as much of a surprise to his partner as it was to the audience. Reiner continued to act as the voice of the audience, providing questions and challenging Brooks&#x27; answers. &quot;He was like a district attorney&quot; claims Brooks. Reiner&#x27;s knowledge of history and momentous events raised the bar on the exchanges. &quot;I knew the questions&quot; quipped Reiner, &quot;but I didn&#x27;t know the answers.&quot; While Reiner deferred the great lines to Brooks, he knew his friend well enough to follow along and cross paths enough to prop him up for more opportunities.

==Recordings and performances==
Their first television appearances performing the sketch were on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in February 1961 and then on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; eight months later.

Reiner and Brooks released five comedy albums. The 2000 Year Old Man character appeared on one track for each of the first three albums and the entirety of the final two.

# &quot;2000 Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks&quot; (1960)
# &quot;2000 and One Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks&quot; (1961)
# &quot;Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks at the Cannes Film Festival&quot; (1962)
# &quot;2000 and Thirteen with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks&quot; (Warner Bros. Records, 1973)
# &quot;The 2000 Year Old Man in the Year 2000&quot; (1997)

&quot;The 2000 Year Old Man in the Year 2000&quot; was released concurrently with a companion book of the same name. It also won the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Comedy Album.

There have also been numerous compilation albums such as &quot;Best of the 2000 Year Old Man&quot; (1968) and &quot;Excerpts from The Complete 2000 Year Old Man&quot; (Rhino Records, 1994).

===Animated special===

A half-hour animated television special, &quot;The 2000 Year Old Man&quot;, premiered January 11, 1975. The dialogue for the special was taken from the live recordings of Reiner and Brooks. This special has since been released on home video. The musical introduction was Bach&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonia to Cantata #29&quot; performed on a Moog synthesizer by Mort Garson.

Most of the jokes were previously heard routines and/or eventually brought to the screen in Brooks&#x27; film &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot; (especially the caveman jokes).

==Legacy==
===Home media===
All five comedy albums were compiled and newly remastered on a 3-CD / 1-DVD box set by Shout! Factory for the 50th anniversary. &quot;The 2000 Year Old Man: The Complete History&quot; DVD was released November 24, 2009, and features an interview with Reiner and Brooks; the 1975 animated &quot;2000 Year Old Man&quot; television special, and clips of the two appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show and The New Steve Allen Show.

The album &quot;2000 Years With Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks&quot; was added to the Library of Congress&#x27; National Recording Registry as part of its 2008 selections.

===Appearances in other media===
Mel Brooks appeared as the 2000 Year Old Man to help celebrate the 2000th episode of the original &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; hosted by Art Fleming (February 21, 1972), in which the three highest-scoring undefeated champions at that point returned to play an abbreviated game for charities. During his pre-game appearance he recounted how the show was done 2,000 years earlier—&quot;It wasn&#x27;t this hippy-happy-dappy game you&#x27;ve got here … the moment you walked out of your cave—Jeopardy!&quot; On the March 17, 2014 (S30E131) airing of the current &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; hosted by Alex Trebek, Reiner and Brooks read an entire category of clues as their characters.

Brooks adapted the character to create the 2500 Year Old Brewmaster for Ballantine Beer in the 1960s. Interviewed by Dick Cavett in a series of ads, the Brewmaster (in a German accent, as opposed to the 2000 Year Old Man&#x27;s Jewish voice) said he was inside the original Trojan horse and &quot;could&#x27;ve used a six-pack of fresh air.&quot;

In the episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; entitled &quot;Homer vs. Patty and Selma&quot;, Brooks appears as himself, riding in a limo being driven by Homer. After Homer incorrectly identifies the act as &quot;The 2000-pound man thing,&quot; he and Brooks engage in a brief sketch, with Homer playing the part of Carl Reiner. When Homer is pulled over by the police, Chief Wiggum offers to give Brooks a ride and says they can do &quot;the $2000-Man thing.&quot; Brooks agrees, but asks that he not play Reiner&#x27;s part—&quot;I &quot;hate&quot; Carl Reiner!&quot;, he says.

In an episode of &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot; entitled &quot;The Option Period&quot;, comedy writer Rick Tahoe uses The 2000 Year Old Man as an example of an ideal comedy sketch.

<text>was a village located in Shimajiri District, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. As of 2003, the village had an estimated population of 5,947 and a density of 602.53 persons per km2. The total area was 9.87 km2. On January 1, 2006, Chinen, along with the town of Sashiki, and the villages of Ōzato and Tamagusuku (all from Shimajiri District), was merged to create the city of Nanjō.

==History==
According to the &quot;Chūzan Seikan&quot; (1650), the creation goddess, Amamikyu, built Chinen Castle soon after forming the Ryukyu Islands. Chinen was important for later lords and kings because of its many holy sites, most notably Sefa-utaki.

The village of Chinen (pronounced shi-nen) was appropriated by the United States in 1948 for the purpose of building a secret Central Intelligence Agency operated logistics base, under US Army cover, known as Camp Chinen. Camp Chinen was closed after it was exposed in The Pentagon Papers. The Pentagon Papers revealed a 1961 memo from General Edward Lansdale to General Maxwell Taylor which states that a CIA support base in Okinawa at Camp Chinen housed a covert prison, in addition to a paramilitary training, research and logistics facility. The memorandum read: 

Upon its closure as a CIA station in July 1972, Camp Chinen served as a US Army Special Forces training center, and as a language school for U.S. soldiers studying Japanese and Korean, and for Japanese forces studying English. Camp Chinen closed in 1975.

<doc id="451395" wikidata="Q1351158" url="?curid=451395" title="Yonabaru, Okinawa">
<text>is a town in Shimajiri District, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. It is located at the southern end of Okinawa Island, on the east coast, overlooking Nakagusuku Bay.

As of 2024, the town has a population of 19,817 and a population density of 3,825 persons per km2. The total area is 5.18 km2, making it the second smallest municipality in Okinawa.

==Geography==
Yonabaru is located 9 km east of Naha City, on the eastern coast of the southern part of Okinawa Island, along Nakagusuku Bay. With an area of 5.18 km², it is the smallest municipality on Okinawa Island, and the second smallest in Okinawa Prefecture after Tonaki Village. 

The town is bordered on the south-east by a forest on a low hill (133m) called Amagoimui (雨乞森) and on the northwest by another called Untamamui (運玉森, 158 m). It mainly develops on flat lands between those hills and Nakagusuku Bay. 

The social banditry that took place in Untamamui is famous in Okinawa through the story of Untama Girū. It was dramatized in a film (Untama Girū) that received the Newcomer Award of the Directors Guild of Japan in 1989 and the Caligari Filmpreis Award at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1990.

===Location===
Until the Second World War, Yonabaru had a good natural harbour on Nakagusuku Bay, used by Yanbaru-sen ships. It was an important place for marine transportation and trade on the eastern coast of Okinawa Island. It was also an important junction point for the land transportation both toward the southern and central parts of the island (Shimajiri and Nakagami). However, after the war, it lost its harbour town characteristic. 

It is still nowadays an important junction point between the southern and central parts of the island for land transportation on the eastern coast.

===Topography and Geology===
If you exclude the land reclaimed on the sea, the topographical and geological features of the town can be divided into two groups. Most of the town corresponds to low hills of mudstone and sandstone of the Tertiary Shimajiri Group, with coastal lowlands along Nakagusuku Bay. However, at the boundary with Ōzato (Nanjō City), around the Ōzato Castle Site Park, Ryūkyū limestone can be observed covering the strata of the Shimajiri Group. 

As a consequence of this geological characteristics, most of the soils in the town are of the jāgaru type. Jāgaru soils are adapted to the cultivation of sugar cane. The muddy earth is also used as a resource for the red roof tiles that are a main production of the town.

===Coastal Area===
Until land was reclaimed on the sea, the coast was an area with quiet waves on Nakagusuku Bay, without much coral reef development. Until the Second World War, it was a spot fit for sea bathing with many nice sand beaches but since the water was really shallow, land started to be reclaimed on the sea after the war. This development on the sea still continues nowadays, with the development of the Nakagusuku Bay Harbour Marine Town Project conjointly with the neighbouring town of Nishihara. 

===Climate===
The town, as the rest of Okinawa Island, has a subtropical climate, with really small seasonal temperature variations. The mean temperature is of 22.3°C, the mean annual rainfall is of 1688 mm, with rainfalls mainly in spring and summer, although they can sometimes start earlier. Typhoons mainly come in summer and autumn. 

===Administrative divisions===
The town includes four wards with twelve settlements.

==History==

References to the area represented by the modern town of Yonabaru may be found in the &quot;Omoro Sōshi&quot;, which makes mention of &quot;Yonaharu&quot; and &quot;Yonaha-bama&quot;. According to the , Shō Hashi, before becoming king, acquired iron from foreign ships that came to Yonabaru to trade, forged from this metal tools for farming, and gave these to the people.

Formerly part of Ōzato Magiri, with the abolition of the magiri in 1908, the area of Yonabaru became part of Ōzato Village. A railway line to Naha opened in 1914 and with it came a period of economic growth. Talk during the early Shōwa period of separate municipal status was interrupted by the Pacific War and the foundation of Yonabaru Town had to wait until 1 April 1949.

<doc id="451399" wikidata="Q1351168" url="?curid=451399" title="Tokashiki, Okinawa">
<text>is a village located in the Kerama Islands in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. The village is part of Shimajiri District. Tokashiki is known for its corals, sea, beach and sun. From Tomari Port in Naha, it takes less than one hour to reach this island.

On 28 March 1945, during World War II, 394 inhabitants, mostly from farmer families, were forced by Japanese soldiers to kill themselves, initially with grenades, after the landing of US troops.

==Geography==

The island of Tokashiki consists of 10 islands of various sizes in the center of the Kerama Islands. The village is located approximately west of Naha, the prefectural capital of Okinawa. These islands are rugged and mountainous.

===Administrative divisions===
The village includes three wards, with the Tokashiki ward being divided in two villages.
*Aharen (阿波連)
*Maejima (前島)
*Tokashiki (渡嘉敷)
**Tokashiki (渡嘉敷)
**Tokashiku (渡嘉志久)

===Climate===

==History==

===Early history===

Prior to World War II Tokashiki produced charcoal for the city of Naha. Bonito fishing was also a mainstay of the population of the island, but as the bonito industry declined, the population of the village was reduced greatly.

===World War II===

The American forces landed on Tokashiki on March 27, 1945, as an early part of the Battle of Okinawa. On the following day, March 28, 1945, 394 inhabitants of Tokashiki, mostly from farming families, killed themselves after the landing of US troops, at the command of Japanese soldiers, in a practice that became known as &quot;shūdan jikketsu&quot;, or group suicide. Residents were taken to a cave and given grenades to kill themselves, resorting to beating each other with clubs and rocks once they ran out of grenades. The group suicide on Tokashiki in late March was a precursor to large-scale group suicides on Okinawa Island in the following months.

===Maejima===
The island Maejima once had a population of 380, but a string of powerful typhoons forced the inhabitants to eventually abandon their homes and leave the island, with the last 4 families leaving in February 1962. From then on the island was uninhabited for 42 years until in 2003 a former resident moved back to the island together with his family. They then left in 2024 leaving the island inhabited again

==Transportation==
Tokashiki port is connected to Naha by ferry. But the small Mitshushima ferry also connect the Aharen port to Zamami and Aka.

==Economy==

===Agriculture===

Tokashiki is home to small-scale farming. A small amount of vegetables are produced in the village.

===Tourism===

The village of Tokashiki is part of Okinawa Kaigan Quasi-National Park and is blessed with a remarkable number of spots of scenic beauty. Due to this, the village has promoted tourism as a primary industry since the reversion of Okinawa Prefecture to Japan in 1972. Numerous tourist facilities such as hotels, esplanades, and viewing towers have been built across Tokashiki Island.

==Noted places==
*Shinrin Park. The park is accessible from the Aharen district only by foot, and consist of a wide grassy area and a large-scale wooden for children. Shinrin Park is quiet as it has relatively few visitors.

<doc id="451400" wikidata="Q145373" url="?curid=451400" title="Zamami, Okinawa">
<text>is a village located in Shimajiri District, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. The village consists of more than 20 islands approximately west of the prefectural capital of Naha. As of October 2020 the village had a population of 892 and a population density of 53.29 persons per km². The total area of the village of Zamami is .

On March 3, 2014 (Coral Day), the Kerama Islands, including Zamami Village, were designated a Japanese National Park. Other designations of Zamami include a two-star rating in the Michelin Green Guide Japan, as well as a “Wetland of International Importance” under the Ramsar Convention (2005).

==Geography==

The principal islands of the village of Zamami include , , , and .

Zamami, Aka, and Geruma islands are the only inhabited islands of the village. Many other uninhabited islands are also a part of the village, including Gahi, Agenashiku, Amuro, Yakabi, Kuba, Ou, and Mukaraku.

The village has many coral-sand beaches. For example, on Zamami Island there is Furuzamami Beach and Ama Beach. On Aka Island there is Nishibama Beach.

The islands are quite mountainous. Zamami Island has an observatory atop its central mountain, Takatsukiyama. Aka and Geruma islands are just as hilly. Like much of the rest of Japan, the steep topography leaves relatively little level land for agriculture and inhabitation.

===Administrative divisions===
The village includes five wards.
*Aka (阿嘉)
*Ama (阿真)
*Asa (阿佐)
*Geruma (慶留間)
*Zamami (座間味)

==History==

Zamami was settled as early as the shell midden period of the Ryukyu Islands. The period corresponds roughly to the Jōmon period (14,000 – 300 BC) of the Japanese home islands. Shell middens in Zamami include the Furuzamami midden on Zamami Island and the Utaha midden on Aka Island.

Zamami emerged under the Ryukyu Kingdom as the Jiyaman magiri. The magiri was a type of regional administrative district in Okinawa in the pre-modern period, and Jiyaman magiri, together with Tōkashichi magiri, controlled the Kerama Islands. Zamami was noted for its excellent port, and due to its proximity to Okinawa Island, was used as a port for trade with China during the fourteenth century. The Chinese vessels would stop in Zamami Island’s Ago-no-Ura bay to wait for favorable winds before proceeding on toward China.

Prior to World War II the village was noted for the production of charcoal used in Naha. The village was noted for its numerous fisherman. Bonito fishing was introduced to Zamami in 1901, the first in Okinawa Prefecture, and the village became a center of katsuobushi, a dried bonito fillet essential to Japanese cuisine. Additionally, from the beginning of the Meiji Period until the Second World War, Yakabi and Kuba islands were mined for copper. Today the islands are uninhabited and landing is prohibited except for official religious services at the islands’ sacred sites.

The island was among the first sovereign Japanese lands containing civilian inhabitants to be invaded by America during World War II. It was taken on March 26, 1945 along with other islands in the Kerama archipelago. Before and during the invasion, citizens of Zamami were ordered by the Japanese military to commit suicide using hand grenades. Controversy surrounding this issue continues to this day. The American military used the Kerama islands as a base to launch their invasion of the main Okinawan island on April 1, 1945.

==Economy==

In stark contrast to its calamitous history at the end of World War II, Zamami is now known as a popular tourist destination. Its economy is based almost entirely on tourism, and 92% of the population is employed in the tourism industry. The main activities on Zamami are scuba-diving, snorkeling, sea kayaking, standup paddleboarding, and fishing. Furuzamami beach is popular for its crystal clear waters teeming with coral and fish. Many people flock to the island in winter and early spring for the chance to see humpback whales. There are many locally operated sightseeing boats for this purpose, as well as observation gazebos located around the island. There are smaller, uninhabited islands nearby which are accessible by boat from Zamami&#x27;s harbour. Visitors to Zamami can rent and ride motor scooters around the island&#x27;s narrow and winding mountain roads.

Only of the Zamami is utilized as farmland, and the village has been reduced to only 35 farming families. The village produces small amounts of peanuts, papaya, potatoes, beef, and goat. The fishing industry is likewise in great decline, with only 42 households engaged in fishing. Mozuku (&quot;Cladosiphon okamuranus&quot;), a type of edible seaweed popular in Okinawan cuisine, is the primary marine product of the village. The Port of Aka on Aka Island is the primary fishing port in the village. The Zamami Village Fisheries Cooperative operates shops on both Zamami and Aka islands that sell fresh-caught fish directly to the public.

==Transportation==

===Ferry===

Zamami can be reached by ferry from Tomari port, which is part of the larger Port of Naha or via the Aharen port from Tokashiki. The primary port in the village is the Port of Zamami, which opened in May 1972. The port is owned and operated by Okinawa Prefecture. The standard Zamami ferry takes one and a half hours, while the high speed passenger ferry, Queen Zamami III, takes 50 minutes to reach the islands from Naha. The ferries stop at both Zamami and Aka before heading back to Naha. The Queen Zamami&#x27;s schedule changes between its first and second trip of the day. The schedule in English can be found here.

=== Bus ===
There is a village-run bus on Zamami Island that brings passengers to either Furuzamami Beach or the Asa Hamlet, or to Ama Beach and the surrounding area. The bus costs ¥300 one way.

===Air===

The Kerama Islands are served by the Kerama Airport, located on Fukaji Island.

==Cultural and natural assets==
Zamami Village hosts four designated tangible cultural properties, at the national or municipal level.

<text>Rona Jaffe (June 12, 1931 – December 30, 2005) was an American novelist who published numerous works from 1958 to 2003. During the 1960s, she also wrote cultural pieces for &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Jaffe was born into a Jewish family in 1931 Brooklyn, New York City. She was the only child of Samuel Jaffe, an elementary-school principal, and his first wife, Diana (&quot;née&quot; Ginsberg). Her grandfather was a construction magnate who built the Carlyle Hotel. Growing up in affluent circumstances on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, she attended the Dalton School before graduating from Radcliffe College in 1951.

==Career==
Jaffe wrote her first book, &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; (1958), while working as an associate editor at Fawcett Publications in the 1950s. It was quickly adapted into a film starring Joan Crawford, also called &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; (1959). The book has been described as distinctly &quot;pre-women&#x27;s liberation&quot; in the way it depicts women in the working world. Camille Paglia noted in 2004 that the book and popular HBO series &quot;Sex and the City&quot; had much in common in that the characters in both (who have similar lives) are &quot;very much at the mercy of cads&quot;.

During the late 1960s, Helen Gurley Brown hired Jaffe to write cultural pieces for &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, with a &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot; slant.

In 1981, Jaffe published &quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot;, which depicted a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;-like game that caused disorientation and hallucinations among its players and incited them to violence and attempted suicide. Written at a time of emerging anxiety over the effects of role-playing games (RPGs), the book might have been loosely based on press accounts of the 1979 &quot;steam tunnel incident&quot; involving the disappearance of Michigan State University student and D&amp;D aficionado James Dallas Egbert III. With both concerns over and interest in role-playing games further stoked by the efforts of anti-RPG campaigners such as Patricia Pulling, founder of the advocacy group Bothered About Dungeons &amp; Dragons (B.A.D.D.), within a year of publication &quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot; was adapted by CBS into a made-for-TV movie called &quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot; (1982), featuring a 26-year-old Tom Hanks in one of his earliest appearances.

In 2005, Jaffe died of cancer while vacationing in London, aged 74.

<doc id="451406" wikidata="Q1212739" url="?curid=451406" title="The Stepford Wives">
<text>The Stepford Wives is a 1972 satirical &quot;feminist horror&quot; novel by Ira Levin. The story concerns Joanna Eberhart, a talented photographer, wife, and young mother who suspects that something in the town of Stepford is changing the wives from free-thinking, intelligent women into compliant wives dedicated solely to homemaking. As her friends slowly transform, Joanna realizes the horrific truth.

The book has had two feature film adaptations, both using the same title as the novel: the 1975 version, and the 2004 remake. Edgar J. Scherick produced the 1975 version as well as all three of the television sequels. Scherick was credited posthumously as producer of the 2004 remake.

In a March 27, 2007, letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Levin said that he based the town of Stepford on Wilton, Connecticut, where he lived in the 1960s. Wilton is a &quot;step&quot; from Stamford, a major city lying away.

== Plot ==
The premise involves the married men of the fictional Fairfield County town of Stepford, Connecticut and their fawning, submissive, impossibly beautiful wives. The protagonist is Joanna Eberhart, a talented photographer newly arrived from New York City with her husband and children, eager to start a new life. 

As time goes on, she becomes increasingly disturbed by the submissive wives of Stepford who seem to lack free will, especially when she sees her once independent-minded friends (Bobbie, Charmaine), fellow new arrivals to Stepford, turn into mindless, docile housewives, each time beginning after a romantic weekend with their respective husbands. All the women deny anything is wrong. Joanna&#x27;s own husband, Walter, who seems to be spending more and more time at meetings of the local men&#x27;s association, mocks her fears.

As the story progresses, Joanna becomes convinced that the wives of Stepford are being poisoned or brainwashed into submission by the men&#x27;s club. She visits the library and researches the pasts of Stepford&#x27;s wives, discovering that some of the women were once feminist activists and successful professionals. The leader of the men&#x27;s club is a former Disney engineer and others are artists and scientists, capable of creating lifelike robots. Her friend Bobbie helps her investigate, going so far as to write to the state department of health to inquire about possible toxins in Stepford. However, eventually, Bobbie is also transformed into a docile housewife after a &quot;romantic getaway&quot; with her husband. 

At the end of the novel, Joanna decides to flee Stepford, but when she gets home, she finds that her children have been taken. She asks her husband to let her leave but he takes her car keys. She manages to escape from the house on foot and several of the men&#x27;s club members track her down. They corner her in the woods, and she accuses them of creating robots out of the town&#x27;s women. The men deny the accusation and ask Joanna if she would believe them if she saw one of the other women bleed. Joanna agrees and they take her to Bobbie&#x27;s house. Bobbie&#x27;s husband and son are upstairs, with loud rock music playing. Bobbie brandishes an unusually large knife at Joanna, who desperately tries to convince herself that her friend isn’t a robot and that the loud music upstairs isn’t meant to cover up her screams as the former stabs her to death. Bobbie beckons her closer and Joanna complies.

In the story&#x27;s epilogue, Joanna has become another Stepford wife gliding through the local supermarket, having given up her career as a photographer because, as she puts it, &quot;housework&#x27;s enough for me&quot;. Ruthanne Hendry (a new resident and the first black woman in Stepford) appears poised to become the next victim.

== Themes ==

=== The reaction of men to feminism ===
Michelle Arrow says: &quot;not only a satire of male fears of women&#x27;s liberation, but a savage view of heterosexual marriage. In this telling, a man would rather kill his wife and replace her with a robot than commit to equality and recognise her as a whole person.&quot;

=== The role of women in the home ===
There are many feminist themes in &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;. The novel tackles the role of women in the nuclear family and the control they have over their bodies by allowing the readers to observe what happens in Stepford when Joanna moves in. Before the women in Stepford turned into lifeless, docile robots, they were avid activists and successful career women who had lives outside of being a wife. However, the men in Stepford were opposed to this, turning their wives into robots and reducing their only purposes in life down to serving their husbands.

===Consent===
The theme of consent is tackled in &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; franchise. The reason why the men in Stepford make their wives into submissive robots is that they are afraid of losing control over their wives. The similarity between sex robots and the women in Stepford is that they are both lifeless and docile, hence the men do not need consent in order to fulfill their sexual desire.

== Adaptations ==
In 1975, the book was adapted into a science fiction thriller directed by Bryan Forbes with a screenplay by William Goldman and starring Katharine Ross, Paula Prentiss, Peter Masterson and Tina Louise. While the script emphasis is on gender conflict and the sterility of suburban living, and thus the science fiction elements are only lightly explored, the movie still makes it much clearer than the book that the women are being replaced by some form of robot. Goldman&#x27;s treatment of the book differed from that of Forbes, with the robots closer to an idealized Playboy Bunny; it has been claimed that the look was scrapped when Forbes&#x27;s actress wife Nanette Newman was cast as one of the town residents.

A 1980 television sequel was titled &quot;Revenge of the Stepford Wives&quot;. In this film, instead of being androids, the wives underwent a brainwashing procedure and then took pills that kept them hypnotized. In the end, the wives broke free of their conditioning and a mob of them killed the mastermind behind the conspiracy.

In a 1987, a television sequel/remake titled &quot;The Stepford Children&quot;, both the wives and the children of the male residents were replaced by drones. It ended with the members of the conspiracy being killed.

A 1996 version called &quot;The Stepford Husbands&quot; was made as a third television movie with the gender roles reversed and the men in the town being brainwashed by a female clinic director into being perfect husbands.

Another film titled &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; was released in 2004. It was directed by Frank Oz and featured Nicole Kidman, Bette Midler, Matthew Broderick, Christopher Walken, Roger Bart, Faith Hill, Glenn Close and Jon Lovitz. It was intended to be more comedic than the previous versions. The new script by screenwriter Paul Rudnick has the women being transformed into carefully controlled cyborgs rather than being murdered and replaced with robots. The script culminates in a twist ending in which it is a powerful woman (played by Glenn Close) who is the evil mastermind of the injustice perpetrated on other women, and features a &quot;Stepfordized&quot; male partner of a gay town resident. Unlike the original novel and most of the adaptations, the perpetrators of the conspiracy neither die nor get away with their crimes; the victims are freed from their control programming and subject their husbands to a taste of their own medicine as restitution. 

Both versions were filmed in various towns in Fairfield County, Connecticut, including Redding, Westport, Darien, New Canaan, Wilton and Norwalk. The 1975 version had several locations in the Greenfield Hill section of Fairfield, including the Eberharts&#x27; house and the Greenfield Hill Congregational Church. Additional scenes from the 2004 movie were filmed in Bedminster, New Jersey, with extras from surrounding communities.

== In language ==
The term &quot;Stepford wife&quot; entered common use in the English language after the publication of Levin&#x27;s book. It is generally used as a derogatory term for a submissive and docile wife who seems to conform to the stereotype of a subservient role in relationship to her husband.

Hornburg is part of the &quot;Samtgemeinde&quot; (&#x27;collective municipality&#x27;) Schladen and home to numerous historically valuable half-timber buildings (&quot;Fachwerkhäuser&quot;). It is located on the German Timber-Frame Road.
Hornburg Castle was first mentioned in a 994 deed as a property of the Bishopric of Halberstadt. In 1005, it was the birthplace of Pope Clement II. The fortress located on a limestone plateau served to control the northern border of the bishopric and the trade routes from Halberstadt to Braunschweig and Hildesheim. It was devastated by Henry the Lion in 1179, during his conflict with the bishop, an ally of Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, who had the castle rebuilt.

In 1528, the attached settlement was denoted as a town by the Halberstadt bishops. It received market rights in 1552. At the same time, Hornburg, thriving from the cultivation of humulus (hop) for beer brewing, was surrounded by a town wall including five gates. The ensemble of about 400 Renaissance timber-framed houses arose after a blaze in 1512 had devastated nearly all of Hornburg&#x27;s buildings. The reconstruction of the town with elaborately carved &quot;Fachwerk&quot; houses was modeled after the townscape of Halberstadt. With the bishopric Hornburg turned Protestant in 1540. The parish church &quot;Beatae Mariae Virginis&quot; is considered one of the first Lutheran hall churches in the region. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War Hornburg was occupied by the Imperial field marshal Johann Tserclaes von Tilly in 1626, but conquered by Swedish troops in 1630. In 1645, the Swedish military Hans Christoff von Königsmarck finally had the castle destroyed. The current building is a reconstruction on a private initiative or Georg Lüdecke in 1927, based on an engraving by Merian from around 1650 with plans by Bodo Ebhardt.

With the secularization of the Halberstadt bishopric in 1648, Hornburg fell to the electors of Brandenburg and after the 1815 Congress of Vienna it became part of the Prussian province of Saxony. Hornburg stayed a Prussian town until 1941, when it was attached to the Free State of Brunswick in the course of the establishment of the City of Salzgitter. Therefore, at the end of World War II Hornburg found itself in British occupation zone and later became a West German town.

<text>, also spelt as Minami Daitō or Minami-Daitō, is the largest island in the Daitō Islands group southeast of Okinawa, Japan. It is administered as part of the village of Minamidaitō, Okinawa. Shimajiri District, Okinawa and has a population of 2,107. The island is entirely cultivated for agriculture. The island has no beaches but has a fishing boat harbor and three cargo and ferry ports; as well as an airport Minami Daito Airport (airport code &quot;MMD&quot;).

==Geography==
Minamidaitōjima is a relatively isolated coralline island, located approximately south of Kitadaitōjima, the second largest island of the archipelago, and from Naha, Okinawa. As with the other islands in the archipelago, Minamidaitōjima is an uplifted coral atoll with a steep coastal cliff of limestone (the former fringing coral reef of the island), and a depressed center (the former lagoon of the island). The island is roughly oval in shape, with a circumference of about , length of and an area of . The highest point is above sea level. The island contains several ponds in the interior, such as the Ōike-pond.

==Climate==
Minamidaitōjima has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;) with hot summers and warm winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year; the wettest month is June and the driest month is February. The island is subject to frequent typhoons.

==History==
It is uncertain when Minamidaitōjima was discovered. It is the most likely that their first sighting was by the Spanish navigator Bernardo de la Torre in 1543, in between 25 September and 2 October, during his abortive attempt to reach New Spain from the Philippines with the . It was then charted, together with Kitadaitōjima, as &quot;The Two Sisters&quot; (). Minamidaitōjima and Kitadaitōjima were possibly again sighted by the Spanish on 28 July 1587, by Pedro de Unamuno who named them the &quot;Useless Islands&quot; (). In 1788 the British captain John Meares named an island in the vicinity “Grampus Island”, but the recorded coordinates are not correct and it is not certain which of the Daitō island he sighted . The French also reported sighting an island in 1807. However, on 2 July 1820 the Russian vessel Borodino surveyed the two Daitō islands, and named the south as &quot;South Borodino Island&quot;. 

The island remained uninhabited until claimed by the Empire of Japan in 1885. In 1900, a team of pioneers from Hachijōjima, one of the Izu Islands located south of Tokyo led by Tamaoki Han&#x27;emon (1838 – 1910), became the first human inhabitants of the island, and started the cultivation of sugar cane. The population reached 4000 in 1919. During this period until World War II, Minamidaitōjima was owned in its entirety by Dai Nippon Sugar (now Dai Nippon Meiji Sugar), which provided community services and subsidized pricing for its employees, and of whom were seasonal workers from Okinawa and Taiwan.

The island was garrisoned by the Japanese military in 1942. As the war situation worsened for Japan, many of the civilian inhabitants were evacuated to Okinawa, Kyushu or Hachijojima in 1944. The island was repeatedly bombed and shelled by the United States Navy from February to June 1945.

After World War II, the island was occupied by the United States, at which time its civilian population was 1426. The island was returned to Japan in 1972.

<text>is a village consisting of the islands of Kitadaitōjima and Okidaitōjima of Shimajiri District, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan.

As of October 2016, the village has an estimated population of 615 and a density of 47 persons per km2. The total area is 13.10  km2. All of the inhabitants live on Kitadaitōjima.

==Geography==

Kitadaitō Island is located about 360 km east of Okinawa Island. It is the easternmost island in Okinawa Prefecture. The island shows characteristic landscape of a raised coral reef island, with a very flat area in its centre.

Okidaitō Island is entirely the private property of the Rasae Group, that used to exploit phosphate ore there. It was then rented by the U.S. Forces in Japan as a shooting range, that started to be used conjointly by the Japan Self Defence Forces in 2015. It is off limits to civilians and currently uninhabited.

=== Area ===
* Kitadaitō Island: 11.94 km²
* Okidaitō Island: 1.15 km²

=== Administrative divisions ===
The village includes four wards.
* Minami (南)
* Minato (港)
* Nakano (中野)
* Rasa (ラサ)

===Group of Water Collecting Ponds===
Kitadaitō Village does not present, as Minamidaitō Village, many natural bogs. There is, in the centre of the island, a large fresh water pond, the level of which changes with the tides due to the freshwater lens effect. This pond used to be a very valuable water resource before the desalination process enabled the creation of a tap water network in the village. It is currently only used for agricultural purposes. 
There are also many artificial water ponds, such as the &quot;East Water Tank&quot; that is the easternmost water tank of Okinawa Prefecture, the &quot;Red Pond&quot; located in front of the sugar factory or the many smaller agricultural ponds. This water is an important resource for the irrigation of the 274 ha (50% of the island area) of sugar cane fields.
The sixteen water ponds of Kitadaitō have been registered on the &quot;One Hundred Noticeable Water Pond List&quot; of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on March the 25th 2010.

Those ponds are important resting places for migrating birds such as ospreys, black kites, grey-faced buzzards or herons and a famous birdwatching spot. Every year on the Sugar Cane Day (4th Sunday of April), the residents and the Children Association clean around the ponds.

==Climate==
Kitadaitō has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;) with very warm summers and mild winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year; the wettest month is June and the driest month is February. The island is subject to frequent typhoons.
==History==
Kitadaitōjima remained uninhabited until formally claimed by the Empire of Japan in 1885. In 1900, a team of pioneers from Hachijōjima became the first human inhabitants of the island, and started the cultivation of sugar cane from 1903. Until World War II, Kitadaitōjima was owned in its entirety by Dai Nippon Sugar (now Dai Nippon Meiji Sugar), which also operated mines for the extraction of guano for use in fertilizer. After World War II, the island was occupied by the United States. The village of Kitadaitō was established in 1946. The island was returned to Japan in 1972.

==Economy==

Formerly heavily dependent on phosphate mining, the village economy is now based on cultivation of sugar cane, commercial fishing, and seasonal tourism. There is no port on the island and ships must be loaded/offloaded by crane.

==Transport==
The island has an airport, Kitadaito Airport, with one flight a day to Minami-Daito Airport

==Education==

There is the Kitadaito Village Kitadaito Elementary-Junior High School (北大東村立北大東小中学校 &quot;Kitadaitō Sonritsu Kitadaitō Shōchūgakkō&quot;) and the Kitadaito Village Kitadaito Kindergarten (北大東村立北大東幼稚園 Kitadaitō Sonritsu Kitadaitō Yōchien&quot;).

<text>is a village occupying Izena Island in the north of Okinawa Prefecture, Japan (though administered as part of Shimajiri District). There are five localities of about equal size and population located on the island: Izena, Nakada, Shomi, Uchihana, and Jicchaku (also called Serikyaku).

Izena&#x27;s primary claim to fame is that it was the birthplace of King Shō En, the first king of the Second Shō Dynasty. It is also the birthplace of the contemporary artist Naka Bokunen and musician (伊禮 俊一 &quot;Irei Shun&#x27;ichi&quot;).

==Geography==
As of 1 October 2020, the island has an estimated population of 1,322 and a density of 86 persons per square kilometer. The total area is .
The island&#x27;s topography features a row of mountains spanning from the northwest to the southeast of the island, with generally flat, arable land covering the remainder. The island has several sandy beaches and designated camping areas with bathroom facilities. The view of Izena&#x27;s rocky southern coastline is well known as one of Japan&#x27;s best, with the rock formations &#x27;Umi Gitara&#x27; and &#x27;Agi Gitara&#x27; dramatically rising from the land and sea.

===Administrative divisions===
The village includes five wards.
*Izena (伊是名)
*Nakada (仲田)
*Uchihana (内花)
*Serikyaku (勢理客)
*Shomi (諸見)

==Climate==
==Economy==
Izena&#x27;s main crops are sugar and the edible seaweed mozuku, but there are also several rice paddies, livestock farms, and a cattle breeding facility. From December through April, sugar is harvested and processed at a refinery on the island before being exported. There is an awamori distillery in Izena Village that produces several varieties of the beverage.

Commerce on the island is limited to a small grocery store, gas station, farmer&#x27;s market, and building supply store that are operated by Japan&#x27;s Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives, several other independently owned convenience stores, restaurants, and bars in each of the island&#x27;s 5 villages, and several hotels along the beach and in the island&#x27;s center. There is a scuba diving shop in Nakada Village open in the summer that provides equipment and tours.

==History==
Izena is one of only a handful of places in Okinawa that was not ravaged by American and Japanese military forces during World War II, although American bombing on the nearby island of Iheya resulted in approximately 50 civilian deaths. When American Marines landed on Izena during the night of June 23, 1945, they encountered no hostile defenses or enemy combatants and left shortly thereafter.

==Cultural Properties==
Izena Village includes many cultural properties.

==Transportation==
The island is accessible by a ferry that makes two daily round trips between Nakada Port and Unten Port in Nakijin Village, which is located North of Nago on Okinawa&#x27;s main island. The ferry trip takes approximately one hour. Izena also has an airfield, though daily service to the island by airplane was halted in 2007.

==Education==
There are a kindergarten, junior high school and elementary school, all located near the center of the island and serving all five villages.
As of 2010, the average size of each grade is 20 students.

Okinawa Prefectural Board of Education operates senior high schools elsewhere in the prefecture.

After graduating from junior high school, students must move to mainland Okinawa if they wish to attend high school. In the sense that they no longer live together, the island&#x27;s youth become independent from their parents at 15 years old.

==Events==
Izena Island hosts an annual triathlon, the Izena 88 (2 km swim + 66 km bike + 20 km run) in the Autumn, participation of which (in 2007) was numbered at around 830. There is also a kids&#x27; triathlon for island residents on the day preceding the main race.

Since 2001, the Okinawa Prefecture Deep Seawater Research Institute has researched the uses of deep seawater on Kumejima, fostering the development of new aquaculture and production industries totaling $20 million in yearly revenue. Due to the deep seawater resource, Kumejima now has the largest market share of Sea Grapes and Kuruma Prawns in Japan.

In March 2013, Okinawa Prefecture completed the world&#x27;s only fully operational Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Demonstration Facility. The facility is open to tours by appointment for free.

<text>is a district located in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, that consists of a single village, Tarama.

==Towns and villages==
*Tarama

==History==

Miyako District was formally established in 1896, and spanned all of the Miyako Islands, which are located approximately west of the prefectural capital of Naha. Miyako Island served as the administrative center of the district. In the administrative reforms of 1908 the former magiri administrative system was abolished, and Miyako District was divided into four villages: Hirara, Shimoji, Gusukube, and Irabu. In 1913 the localities of Nakasuji, Shiokawa, and Minna were separated from Hirara Village to form a fifth village, Tarama. Hirara was elevated to town status in 1924.

The number of municipalities that formed the Miyako District greatly declined after World War II. Hirara was elevated to city status in 1947, leaving the district with fewer villages. A new village, Ueno, was formed in 1948. On October 1, 2005, Hirara, the towns of Irabu and Gusukube, and the village of Ueno merged to form the city of Miyakojima. At present the district consists of a single village, Tarama.

==Transportation==
Tarama Airport in Tarama serves the Miyako District.

<text>is a village located in Miyako District, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. The village consists of Tarama Island and Minna Island between Ishigaki Island and Miyako Island.

, the village has a population of 1,058 residents and 466 households. It has a density of 48.1 persons per km2 and the total area is .

==History==

Under the Ryukyu Kingdom, Tarama is said to have been used as a penal colony for political prisoners.

In 1879, with the abolition of the han system and creation of the prefectures of Japan, Tarama became part of the newly formed Okinawa Prefecture. In 1896 the village became part of Miyako District. In 1908, with the abolishment of the magiri system in Okinawa, the three districts of present-day village, Nakasuzu, Shiyugaa, and Minna, became part of the village of Hirara. They were separated from Hirara in 1913 as part of a further redistricting of Okinawa, and incorporated as the Village of Tarama.

The village hall of Tarama was the first modern tiled structured to be built on the islands, and the first village council consisted of eight citizens. Residents of Minna completed a planned relocation to the Takano district of Hirara in 1961.

Tarama was electrified and received direct telephone service in 1964, and residents were supplied with power for five hours a day. This increased to 17 hours a day by 1969, and the village was fully electrified in 1972. Regular ferry service to the village began in the same period, and Tarama Airport was opened in December 1971.

==Geography==

The two islands of the village, Tarama and Minna, are located at the midpoint between Ishigaki Island and Miyako Island. The islands face the Pacific Ocean to the south and the East China Sea to the north. The two islands have historically suffered from typhoon damage and drought.
===Administrative divisions===
The village is divided in three wards. 
*Minna (水納)
*Nakasuji (仲筋)
*Shiokawa (塩川)

===Climate===
Tarama has tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;), bordering on a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;).
==Demographics==

Tarama has seen population decline since the beginning of the 20th century. In the period prior to World War II typhoon damage and drought caused many residents to leave the island, mostly to Osaka and areas of the newly formed Japanese Empire. Residents of Tarama emigrated to Taiwan, the South Pacific, Korea, and Manchuria in this period. Residents of Minna completed a planned relocation to the Takano district of Hirara in 1961. At present the population of Minna Island has only one household and two people.

==Education==

The Village of Tarama has one preschool, one elementary school, and one junior high school, all named Tarama.

* Tarama Elementary School (多良間小学校)
* Tarama Junior High School (多良間中学校)
* Tarama Kindergarten (多良間幼稚園)

The preschool and Tarama Elementary school are connected, and located directly south of the village hall at the north of the island. Tarama Junior High School is located south of the village hall. Minna, due to its depopulation, no longer has any educational institutions. The village has no high school; students must leave the island to attend high schools in other areas of Okinawa Prefecture.

==Transportation==

Tarama Airport serves the island.

<text>Allan Robert Border (born 27 July 1955) is an Australian cricket commentator and former international cricketer. A batsman, Border was for many years the captain of the Australian team, and led his team to victory in the 1987 Cricket World Cup, the maiden world title for Australia. His playing nickname was &quot;A.B.&quot;. He played 156 Test matches in his career, a record until it was passed by fellow Australian Steve Waugh. Border formerly held the world record for the number of consecutive Test appearances of 153, before it was surpassed in June 2018 by Alastair Cook, and is second on the list of number of Tests as captain.

He was primarily a left-hand batsman but also had occasional success as a part-time left-arm orthodox spinner. Border amassed 11,174 Test runs (a world record until it was passed by Brian Lara in 2006). He hit 27 centuries in his Test career. He retired as Australia&#x27;s most-capped player and leading run-scorer in both Tests and ODIs. His Australian record for Test Match runs stood for 15 years before Ricky Ponting overtook him during the Third Ashes Test against England in July 2009.

Border was one of the 55 inaugural inductees of the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Allan Border was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for his role as a &quot;sports legend&quot;.

In 2016, Border was a recipient of the Queensland Greats Awards. In a fan poll conducted by the CA in 2017, he was named in the country&#x27;s best Ashes XI in the last 40 years.

==Early years==
Born in Cremorne, a North Shore suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Border grew up with three brothers in the nearby suburb of Mosman. His father John, from Coonamble in rural New South Wales, was a wool classer and his mother Sheila was the proprietor of a corner store. The family had a spacious backyard for playing games, and Mosman Oval, the home of district cricket, football, hockey and baseball clubs, was across the street. Border attended North Sydney Boys High School, and earned his leaving certificate in 1972.

Throughout his early years, Border played in cricket teams two or three years older than his age group. He also played for Mosman Baseball Club, where he developed his fielding and horizontal-bat shots. Aged sixteen, he made his début for Mosman in Sydney Grade Cricket as a left arm orthodox spinner and batted at number nine. He won selection for the 1972–73 Combined High Schools team in the intrastate carnival. During this time, he was coached by Barry Knight, a former England international.

==Cricket career==
Border accumulated more than 600 runs in grade cricket in 1975–76, and at the start of the following season, he made two consecutive centuries to earn selection for NSW. In the absence of a number of Test players, Border made his debut against Queensland at the SCG in January 1977. He compiled 36 and took the last three catches of the match, as his team claimed victory. Border resigned from his job as a clerk in the film library of BP to spend the 1977 English season playing for Downend in the Gloucestershire Western League. The highlight of his stay was 159 not out in an invitational match against Cambridge University. In Australia, Border compiled 617 runs at 36.29 average during the 1977–78 Sheffield Shield season. He then returned to England and played for East Lancashire Cricket Club in the Lancashire League, scoring 1191 runs at 56.71 and taking 54 wickets at 18.60.

===Test debut during WSC===
In 1977, the breakaway professional competition World Series Cricket (WSC) signed many players who were then banned from first-class and Test cricket, thus leaving many vacancies in the Australian team. Border started the 1978–79 season with his maiden first-class century, 135 against Western Australia at Perth, and followed up with 114 against Victoria at the SCG. After Australia lost the first two Tests in the Ashes series, Border was selected for his Test debut at the MCG. Making a nervous start, he took more than half an hour to score three runs. He made 29 and was run out for a duck in the second innings while attempting a single. In the following Test at Sydney, he was in a &quot;lonely class of his own&quot; by top-scoring in both innings with 60 not out and 45 not out as Australia lost the match and the Ashes. He used his feet to the spinners as his teammates struggled to cope with the turn. However, after scores of 11 and 1 in the Fifth Test at Adelaide he was dropped for the Sixth Test. This was the only test he missed in his entire career; he played in all of Australia&#x27;s next 153 tests.

Recalled for the First Test against Pakistan at the MCG, Border batted at No. 3 and hit his maiden Test century as Australia reached 3/305, chasing 382 for victory. Border&#x27;s dismissal for 105 triggered a major collapse of seven wickets for five runs as the other batsmen were unable to cope with the swing of Sarfraz Nawaz. Australia lost by 71 runs. Border made 85 and 66 not out as Australia squared the series with a victory in Perth. In his second Test series, he had topped the batting aggregates and averages with 276 runs at 92.00.

=== Post-WSC place ===
In May 1979, the ACB announced an agreement with WSC, which allowed the WSC players to return to international cricket at the start of the 1979–80 Australian season. In the meantime, Australia made two tours, giving the incumbent players an opportunity to press for places in a reunited team. The first tour, to England for the 1979 Cricket World Cup, ended with Australia being eliminated in the first round. Border scored 59 runs in two innings.

This was followed by a three-month-long, six-Test tour of India, on which Australia failed to win a single match. Border scored 521 runs at 43.42 in the Test series, including 162 in the First Test at Madras, where he displayed excellent footwork and handled the Indian spinners much more effectively than his teammates. As a result of his performances in India, he was one of only three players to retain their places for the 1st Test against West Indies at Brisbane in December 1979, and the 1st Test when the WSC players returned to the official Australian team. In the next test against England at Perth Border scored 115 in the second innings to secure victory and in doing so passed 1,000 Test runs. He had done so in only 354 days, the fastest ever by an Australian, and made more runs (1,070) in his first year as a Test cricketer than anyone before. He was unable to maintain this form, however, and ended the season with 317 runs at 31.70 in six Tests against England and the West Indies.

On the tour of Pakistan that followed, Border hit 150 not out and 153 in the Third Test at Lahore against spinners of the calibre of Iqbal Qasim and Tauseef Ahmed to become the first, and so far only batsman in Test history to pass 150 in both innings of a Test. In the off-season, Border married Jane Hiscox, and moved to Brisbane to begin playing for Queensland. During the 1980–81 season, he scored 328 runs at 36.44 in six Tests against New Zealand and India, a modest return boosted by a score of 124 against the latter at Melbourne in the final Test of the summer.

===Stubborn resistance===
In 1981, Border made his first Ashes tour and scored a half-century in each of the first two Tests. &quot;Border alone of the established players came through with reputation enhanced&quot;; in the Fifth Test at Old Trafford when he batted with a fractured left finger. He reached a century in 377 minutes, the slowest Test hundred by an Australian, and remained unbeaten on 123 as Australia lost the match. In the final Test at The Oval, Border scored 106 not out and 84. During this latter sequence, he defied the English bowlers for more than 15 hours to score 313 runs before he was dismissed. Overall, he totalled 533 (at 59.22); this prompted Sir Leonard Hutton to call him the best left-handed batsman in the world and resulted in his selection as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1982.

Border&#x27;s 1981–82 season was mixed. Against Pakistan, he made only 84 runs in three Tests, but against the West Indies, he scored a century and three half-centuries in 336 runs (at 67.20) to help Australia draw the series. On the tour of New Zealand, his three Tests brought only 44 runs at 14.67. After having the winter off, Border returned to Pakistan but was unable to repeat his performances of two years earlier. He scored 118 runs at 23.60 as Pakistan won all three Tests.

After failing in the first three Tests of the 1982–83 Ashes series, Border&#x27;s place in the Australian team was in jeopardy as Australia led the series 2–0. Border&#x27;s effort in Australia&#x27;s loss in the Fourth Test at the MCG is one of his best remembered Test innings. Australia had lost nine wickets and required 74 runs to win when Jeff Thomson joined Border at the crease. Border, batting at 6, came in at 4–141, with Australia chasing 292, and took 40 minutes to get off the mark, before finishing the fourth day on 44 not out, with last man Thomson on 8 not out. The chances of what would have been an extraordinary victory grew during the final session of the fourth day, by the end of which Border and Thomson had put on 37 – exactly half of the runs required. 18,000 spectators attended the final day&#x27;s play (the MCG opening the ground to spectators free of charge, and the spectators turning up despite knowing that they might see no more than a single ball bowled) as the pair slowly accumulated runs, before a juggling catch (Geoff Miller at second slip taking a chance fumbled by Chris Tavare at first) dismissed Thomson when Australia were three runs short of the target. Border was left on 62 not out. Border then scored 89 and 83 in the Fifth Test at Sydney to secure a drawn match and Australia regained the Ashes. His series figures were 317 runs at 45.28 average.

=== New era ===
Australia hosted Pakistan for a five-Test series in 1983–84. Border scored 118 and 117 not out in the Second and Third Tests respectively, and averaged just under 86 as Australia won the series comfortably. It was the end of an era for Australian cricket as Rod Marsh, Dennis Lillee and Greg Chappell retired at the end of the season, leaving the Australian team short on experience. At the time, Lillee and Marsh held the world records for the most Test wickets and wicket-keeping catches respectively, while Chappell was Australia&#x27;s highest-ever runscorer. Consequently, Border, who was now captain of Queensland, became Australian vice-captain to Kim Hughes for the tour of the West Indies in the northern spring of 1984.

After a drawn First Test, Border played two classic innings in the Second Test at Queen&#x27;s Park Oval in Trinidad. In poor light and on a bouncy wicket, Australia had slumped to three for sixteen when Border came to the crease. He finished unbeaten on 98 in a total of 255. The West Indies took a 213-run lead and then reduced Australia to three for 55 late on the fourth day. Border again resisted, but Australia slumped to nine for 238, just 25 runs in front, when Terry Alderman joined Border. Together, they batted for 105 minutes to save Australia from defeat and, in the words of journalist Malcolm Knox, &quot;earn the most miraculous draw.&quot; Border struck the final ball of the match for a boundary to reach 100 not out, having resisted the bowling for 634 minutes in the match. &quot;He&#x27;d proved himself as the one man who could stand up to them,&quot; wrote Knox.

Australia lost the final three Tests, but Border ended the series with 521 runs at 74.73. This was twice as many runs as the next best Australian.

=== Reluctant captain ===

After a short successful tour of India, Australia faced the West Indies again in the 1984–85 season. After suffering heavy losses in the first two Tests, Hughes was unable to fight back tears as he resigned as captain during a press conference. Despite Border&#x27;s limited captaincy experience and stated indifference to taking the position, he replaced Hughes for the Third Test at Adelaide, which the Australians also lost: it was their sixth consecutive defeat to the West Indies. The tide turned somewhat when Border led the team to a draw and then a win in the final two Tests, but his own form suffered, and he averaged only 27.33 for his 246 runs. He distinguished himself in the one-dayers, though, by savaging an attack comprising Michael Holding, Joel Garner, Malcolm Marshall, Winston Davis and Viv Richards for 127 not out off 140 balls at the SCG. Knox, who was present that day, described him as &quot;the finest all-round one-day cricketer of his time, alongside Viv Richards&quot;, in spite of the fact that &quot;his reputation is built on stodge and defiance&quot;.

In April 1985, Australia&#x27;s prospects were weakened when plans were announced for a team of Australians to tour South Africa, in defiance of the Gleneagles Agreement. Seven players, originally selected for the 1985 Ashes tour, had signed for the Hughes-led &quot;rebel&quot; team and withdrew from the squad. The disloyalty of the players affected Border deeply: journalist Mike Coward described his going into a &quot;depression&quot; and noted that, while he eventually forgave the players involved, he never forgot.

Australia was defeated three-one by England, with the team&#x27;s only success coming in the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s, where Border hit 196. His unbeaten 146 in the second innings of the Fourth Test at Manchester saved Australia from another defeat. In all, he amassed 597 runs at 66.33 in the series, and 1,355 first-class runs at 71.31 for the tour, including eight centuries, making him easily Australia&#x27;s best batsman.

Australia continued to struggle during the 1985–86 season, when New Zealand defeated them in a Test series for the first time. Despite Border&#x27;s unbeaten 152 in the second innings, Australia fell to a heavy defeat in the First Test at Brisbane. Although they bounced back to win the Second Test, New Zealand took the Third to take a two-one series victory.

During the subsequent three-Test series against India, the tourists dominated but failed to force a result, and the series was drawn. In the Second Test it took a last-wicket partnership of 77 between Border (who scored 163) and David Gilbert to deny India victory. Border expressed his dismay at Australia&#x27;s inability to perform under pressure.

On the subsequent tour of New Zealand, Border&#x27;s form remained good: he scored 140 and 114 not out in the Second Test, before Australia lost the Third in Auckland, thus losing another series. Over the course of the extended summer, Border scored four Test centuries, but the continued poor form of the team pushed him to breaking point. After another loss in an ODI on the tour, he threatened to quit as captain if performances failed to improve.

===Partnership with Simpson===
The ACB recognised that a lack of support had caused the downfall of Kim Hughes as captain. The process of rebuilding the Australian team was complicated by the unavailability of the players who had gone to South Africa. Furthermore, there was no obvious replacement if Border quit (or was dropped) as captain. In an attempt to share Border&#x27;s workload, and guide the rebuilding of the team, the ACB decided to appoint a permanent coach for the team. Former Australian captain Bob Simpson was sounded out, and he accompanied the team on the 1986 tour of New Zealand as an observer. He accepted the position and his first tour with the team was to India later in the same year.

During the First Test of the tour at Madras, Border scored 106 and the match ended in a historic tie, only the second such result in history. The other two Tests were drawn, and Border finished the tour with 245 runs at 81.66. The 1986–87 Australian season brought another Ashes series, and another series loss. After England won the First Test, consecutive centuries by Border at Perth and Adelaide enabled Australia to secure consecutive draws. However, Australia were defeated by an innings in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne and the team had won only two of their last 22 Tests, and none of their last 14. Despite a consolation victory in the Fifth Test dead rubber, &quot;Wisden&quot; thought that Border, &quot;lacked spark and the ability to inspire a young team much in need of it. Hard task as he had, he did not look the man to lead the Test team from its troubled run.&quot;

===1987 World Cup===

Australia&#x27;s unexpected victory in the 1987 Cricket World Cup proved to be a turning point and heralded the start of more prosperous times. In 1987–88, Australia defeated New Zealand for its first Test series victory in four years. Border hit 205 in the drawn Second Test at Adelaide, his highest Test score which took him past Greg Chappell as Australia&#x27;s highest run-scorer. The Bicentennial Test against England at Sydney was drawn, then Australia won its inaugural home Test match against Sri Lanka. Border&#x27;s contribution for the five Tests was 426 runs at 71.00 average.

Winning overseas still proved elusive for Australia, which lost the 1988 series in Pakistan. Border compiled 230 runs at 57.50, with one century.

===1988–89 Australian summer===
In 1988–89, Australia again lost a test series to the West Indies, and Border&#x27;s form suffered; the West Indies routinely applied a tactic of targeting the opposition captain when he batted, thus undermining his confidence and that of the team. It worked to the extent that Border compiled 258 runs at 32.25 and his best performance was with the ball. He celebrated becoming the first Australian to play 100 Tests by taking 7/46 and 4/50, backed with an innings of 75, in Australia&#x27;s only victory for the series, in the Fourth Test at Sydney. His bowling figures are the best for a match (and second best for an innings) by an Australian captain. Previously, he had taken 16 wickets in 99 Tests. Receiving the player of the match award, Border said, &quot;there will be batsmen all around the world shaking their heads in disbelief when they see the result&quot;.

===Harder edge===
I made a personal choice to have a harder edge as captain, be more stand-offish towards them [the English] ... It was a hard thing to do and they all got the shits, but it was all part and parcel of what I wanted to achieve.

The 1989 Ashes tour was Border&#x27;s first major series win as Test captain. He had consciously fashioned a more aggressive approach to the captaincy. Australia won 4–0, its first victory in a Test series abroad since 1977 (apart from a one-off Test in Sri Lanka) and Australia&#x27;s best result in England since The Invincibles tour of 1948. Border set the tone for the series with attacking innings of 66 and 60 not out in the First Test. In all, he made six half-centuries to end with 442 runs at 73.66. He was subsequently named the 1989 Australian of the Year for his part in helping Australia regain the Ashes.

In the 1989–90 season, Australia played Tests against New Zealand (1), Sri Lanka (2) and Pakistan (3). Australia won twice, against Sri Lanka and Pakistan. It was the first home season in six years that Australia went undefeated. The season ended with a one-off Test in New Zealand, which Australia lost by nine wickets to concede the Trans-Tasman Trophy. Border ended the season with 328 runs at 41, with five half-centuries.

Australia reinforced its superiority over England with a convincing 3–0 win in the 1990–91 Ashes series: the three victories were by eight, nine and ten wickets respectively, and Border compiled 281 runs at 46.83.

=== Missed opportunities ===
Going into the 1991 tour of the Caribbean, Australia was optimistic that its improved team was good enough to inflict the first series defeat on the West Indies for more than a decade. However, after a good start, Australia&#x27;s performances tailed off, and the West Indies won two-one. Border scored 275 runs at 34.37.

In 1991–92 Australia defeated India four-nil, but criticism arose that the team had stagnated since the 1989 Ashes series and needed to turn over players. To that end, the Australian selectors made changes to the team for the Fifth Test, which upset Border. Feeling loyal to the discarded vice-captain Geoff Marsh, Border generated controversy when he refused to travel to Perth with the team after the decision was announced. He maintained his consistency with the bat, however, by scoring 275 runs at 55.00, although he again failed to make a century. His last had been in Pakistan in 1988, a statistic that drew comment from those who criticised his leadership of the team.

Australia, the pre-tournament favourite, was knocked out of the group stage of the 1992 Cricket World Cup and finished fifth. On the 1992 tour of Sri Lanka, which Australia won one-nil, Border recorded his only series victory on the subcontinent as captain. His 106 in the Third Test at Moratuwa ended his four-year spell without a century.

In 1992–93, the West Indies, undergoing a rebuilding phase, toured Australia without the retired Malcolm Marshall, Viv Richards, Jeff Dujon and Gordon Greenidge. Australia had the upper hand in the First Test, but failed to force a victory. Border scored 110 in the Second Test before Shane Warne produced his first great Test bowling performance by taking seven for 52 in the second innings to win the match for Australia. The Third Test was a high-scoring draw, and Border&#x27;s innings of 74 made him the second player after Sunil Gavaskar to pass 10,000 Test runs.

The Fourth Test in Adelaide produced the closest definite result in Test-Match history. Australia slumped to eight for 102 in pursuit of the 186 runs needed to give them a series victory, but the lower-order batsmen rallied and took the side to within one run when Craig McDermott was given out by a controversial decision. Knox recorded Border&#x27;s reaction:

Sitting in the dressing room he clutched a lucky cricket ball in his hands. Finally we were going to beat them. Finally Border was going to beat them. Two runs short, Walsh got Craig McDermott with a lifter. The keeper caught the ball, but the cameras caught Border. He sprang to his feet and hurled his ball into the floor. An entire career&#x27;s worth of frustration captured in a single gesture.

This, felt Knox, became &quot;the enduring image&quot; of Allan Border.

The one-run loss made the Fifth Test at Perth the decider: Australia was unable to regroup after its Adelaide disappointment and succumbed to the pace of the West Indies attack on a traditionally fast and bouncy wicket. Australia was crushed by an innings within three days, Border recording the first pair of his first-class career. It was a poor end to a modest season in which he scored 298 runs at 33.11. His failure to defeat the West Indies was the biggest disappointment of his career: he retired one year before it was finally done.

Australia then made a brief tour of New Zealand, drawing the Test series one-all. In the First Test at Christchurch, Border scored 88, passing Gavaskar&#x27;s record for the most Test runs.

===Final seasons===
In 1993, Border became the first player since Joe Darling to lead Australia in England on three Ashes tours. Australia won 4–1, losing only the Sixth Test to end Border&#x27;s streak of 18 Tests against England without defeat. The series was sealed at Headingley in the Fourth Test when Border made 200 not out. His 533 runs for the series came at an average of 54.12. The Australians then claimed the Trans-Tasman Trophy with a comfortable 2–0 victory over New Zealand at home in late 1993. Border scored 105 in the Third Test on his home ground at Brisbane. It was the last of his 27 Test centuries.

Border ended his career by leading the first Australian team to play a Test series against South Africa in 1994 after their return to international cricket. Three Tests were played in each country, and both series ended 1–1. Border&#x27;s final Test innings was an obdurate 42 not out that helped secure a draw in the Third Test at Durban. Border had a modest time with the bat, accumulating 298 runs at 33.11.

==Playing style==
Border is commonly agreed not to have been an especially attractive or flamboyant cricketer, and accordingly he is remembered more for his rugged graft and admirable fight than for any aesthetic depth. He also became a less aggressive player because in his early days as a captain, he had next to no supporting cast with any experience in international cricket. His batting style has been faithfully described by Malcolm Knox:

Border stood in a baseballer&#x27;s crouch, bat raised, ready to hop backwards and pull or cut the short ball. The Trinidad innings of 1984 were full of twitching jabs at balls aimed into his armpits. As he aged, he became a plainly unattractive batsman to watch, all punch, no grace.

Even so, as Knox acknowledged, he was by no measure a negative player; in fact, he was &quot;a wonderful attacker&quot; and &quot;arguably the best player of spin Australia has produced in 50 years.&quot;

Border was a capable bowler, but, as captain, he underused himself, but he does have a tendency to bowl around the wicket, aiming outside off stump and bowling short. He also distinguished himself as a fielder, especially in his early days as a catcher at what Knox rated &quot;the hardest position, the wide third-to-fifth slips.&quot;

Despite his team&#x27;s poor performances before and in his early reign as a captain, his individual test batting averages had been consistently around 50 before and during captaincy, and across most splits (including home/away tests, and across each individual test grounds).

=== Legacy ===
Ultimately, Border left his successor Mark Taylor with a side that went on to be the best in the world. Border&#x27;s chief regret as captain is said to be his failure to beat the West Indies, something Taylor did the following year. Mike Coward wrote of Border&#x27;s legacy,

[... He] committed the greater part of a long and distinguished career to re-establishing the credibility and image of Australian cricket. A self-effacing man of simple tastes and pleasures, Border served at the most tempestuous time in cricket history, and came to represent the indomitable spirit of the Australian game. As it grappled with two schisms, the first over World Series Cricket, the second over the provocative actions of the mercenaries in South Africa, it was debilitated and destabilised as never before and cried out for a figure of Bradman-esque dimensions to return it to its rightful and influential position on the world stage [... Border] was able to expunge many of the prejudices and preconceptions amongst his team-mates about playing cricket in the Third World [which] was another of the outstanding legacies of his captaincy.

In a 2009 &quot;Cricinfo&quot; tribute to Border, whom he dubbed his &quot;Favourite Cricketer&quot;, Knox wrote that

my appreciation of Allan Border has increased over time. As it should. I feel that Border&#x27;s legacy will grow and grow over the years, as will Brian Lara&#x27;s for similar reasons. Yet while Border developed, under duress, personal leadership skills, which Lara never did, he was never as glamorous as the man who took his world record.

==World records set==

*The first player to play 150 Test Matches.
*The first player to score 11,000 Test runs.
*Most runs in a Test career (11,174 runs) a record held until November 2005 (when it was passed by the West Indian Brian Lara). &quot;(see: List of Test cricket records)&quot;
*Most Test matches played (156) and most consecutive Test matches played (153). The former record has since been surpassed by Steve Waugh, the latter by Alastair Cook.
*Batted in more Test match innings (265) than any other player (since surpassed by Sachin Tendulkar).
*Most Test scores between fifty and 100 (63) and most scores of at least 50 (90). (Since surpassed by Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting).
*Captained in 93 Tests (all consecutive), both world records (the former record has since been surpassed by Graeme Smith)
*Most Test runs as captain (6,623). This record was surpassed by Graeme Smith.
*Most capped Australian player in Tests and ODIs. These records were surpassed by Steve Waugh.
*Leading Australian runscorer in Tests and ODIs. His ODI tally was first surpassed by Mark Waugh in 1999. His Test aggregate was surpassed by Ricky Ponting in 2009.
*Most Test catches by a non-wicket-keeper (156); record since first passed by Mark Taylor in 1999.
*The first, and so far only, player to have scored 150 in each innings of a Test (150* and 153).
*The first, and so far only, player to have scored 100 in each innings of a Test and taken 10 wickets in a match, over the course of their Test career.

He was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1982.

== Post-retirement ==
Border continued playing first-class cricket after his international retirement. In 1994–95, he was a member of the Queensland team that won the Sheffield Shield for the first time. He served as an Australian selector from 1998 until his resignation from the panel in 2005. Border once again became a selector in 2006 only to step down four months later due to his growing business commitments. The Australian cricketer of the year now receives the Allan Border Medal, with the inaugural award having been won by Glenn McGrath in 2000. The India–Australia test series has been named the Border–Gavaskar Trophy.

Two cricket grounds have been renamed in Border&#x27;s honour. The oval in Mosman, which was directly across from the Border family home and where Border played his early grade cricket, was renamed the Allan Border Oval and remains the home ground of the Mosman District Cricket Club. The Neumann Oval in Brisbane has been renamed Allan Border Field and is occasionally used by Queensland as an alternative home ground to The Gabba.

Border wrote an autobiography entitled &quot;Beyond Ten Thousand: My Life Story&quot;, published in 1993. In 2000, he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame and named twelfth man in Australia&#x27;s &quot;Greatest ever ODI Team&quot;, selected from the votes of each of Australia&#x27;s ODI representatives. &quot;He was,&quot; wrote Knox, &quot;the only one to make it into that Team of the Century who had spent most of his career surrounded by strugglers.&quot;

Border became a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 1986, and an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1989. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1990, was named Queenslander of the Year in 1994, and received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000. He was named an Australia Post Legend of Cricket in 2021.

In 2009, Border was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame.

A bronze statue of Border created by Linda Klarfeld was unveiled at The Gabba on 7 December 2021.

As at 2018, Border works as commentator for Fox Sports Australia.

In June 2023, Border revealed that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 2016.

<text>is a town located in Yaeyama District, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan.

The town includes all of the islands in the Yaeyama Islands excluding Ishigaki, Yonaguni, and the Senkaku Islands. This includes the islands of Iriomote, Yubu, Taketomi, Kohama, Kuroshima, Hateruma, and Hatoma. Although Ishigaki is not part of the town of Taketomi, the town hall is located there.

As of October 2016, the town has an estimated population of 4,050 and the population density of . The total area is .

==Geography==

The town includes the inhabited islands of Iriomote, Taketomi, Kohama, Kuro, Hateruma, Hatoma, Aragusuku (comprising the islands of Kamiji and Shimoji) Kayama and Yubu and the surrounding desert islands such as Sotobanari or Nakanokami.&lt;br&gt;
Since all traffic between the different islands in the town go through Ishigaki Island, the town office is located on Ishigaki Island. There is a project to move it to Ōhara on Iriomote Island, but with the completion of the new town office on Ishigaki Island in 2022, the project in Ōhara will probably be downsized. There are only two other municipalities in Japan whose office is located outside of the municipality: Toshima and Mishima in Kagoshima Prefecture.

<doc id="451430" wikidata="Q702623" url="?curid=451430" title="Yonaguni, Okinawa">
<text>is a town located entirely on Yonaguni Island in Yaeyama District, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. It is the westernmost municipality in Japan, and is known for billfish fishing and as a diving spot. In 1987, divers discovered the Yonaguni Monument, a rock formation that some believe may be man-made.

It is also home to two Ryūkyūan writing systems, pictographic &quot;kaida-di&quot; (also used on Ishigaki and Taketomi islands where it is called &quot;kaida-ji&quot;) and the symbols used to indicate family names, &quot;dāhan&quot; (also used on Ishigaki Island where they are called &quot;yāban&quot;).

==History==
Presently, the oldest confirmed ruins are the ruins in Tuguru Beach. Due to the southern style stone tools found, it is thought that a culture influenced by Southeast Asia existed here at one time.

After this point, the history of the island of Yonaguni is unclear, but in the Gusuku Era, settlements were formed on the top of the plateau. The Shima Nakamura Ruins are one example, and it is known for being the birth village of the famous woman chief, San’ai Isoba.

From the time of the Ryūkyū Kingdom, Yonaguni prospered as a commerce center with Taiwan. Due to World War II, until it was placed under control of the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands, the number of people involved in smuggling surged in the area. The population in 1947 had reached 12,000, but although Yonaguni became incorporated as a town, a crackdown on smuggling led to a sharp decrease in the population.

Ishigaki and the surrounding towns and cities are discussing a merger, with the exception of Yonaguni which abstained, cutting the members of parliament from 12 in half, down to 6.
* 1522: Yonaguni was Invaded by the Ryūkyū army and became a territory of the Ryūkyū Kingdom.
* 1872: The Ryūkyū Kingdom is abolished; in its place, the Ryūkyū Domain is established and the island becomes a territory of the Ryūkyū Domain.
* 1879: The Ryūkyū Domain is abolished and becomes Okinawa-ken.
* 1908: The island municipal system abolishes the &quot;magiri&quot; system, and the Ishigaki-magiri, Ōhama-magiri, and Miyara-magiri join the island of Yonaguni to become Yaeyama-son.
* 1914: Through a division of Yaeyama-son, the village of Yonaguni-son is formed.
* 1948: Yonaguni-chō is incorporated as a town.

==Geography==
* Yonaguni is the westernmost part of Japan and is a midpoint between the island of Ishigaki and Taiwan. At Cape Irizaki (Yonagunian language: &quot;Irinzati&quot;) on the western edge of the island, there is a monument inscribed with the words: &quot;The westernmost point in Japan.&quot;
* The western third of the island is not part of Japan&#x27;s air defense identification zone or flight information region; instead, it sits in Taiwan&#x27;s air defense identification zone and flight information region. (Please refer to the article on Yonaguni Airport for more details.)
* The distance between the shoreline of Cape Irizaki on Yonaguni and that of Wushihbi Coastal Nature Reserve in Su&#x27;ao Township, Yilan County, Taiwan is and therefore closer than Ishigaki, which is away. For further comparison, Yonaguni is much closer to Taipei (the capital of Taiwan) at approximately than its own capital (Tokyo), which is about away. Due to this, it is attempting to establish closer relations with Taiwan, including attempting to set up easier access to and from cities in Taiwan, with irregular service to Hualien already established. Further cooperation has been opposed by the central government, thus the lack of further progress.

<doc id="451432" wikidata="Q17146131" url="?curid=451432" title="Wulf">
<text>Wulf (Common Germanic &quot;wolf&quot;) was one of the most prolific elements in early Germanic names. 
It could figure as the first element in dithematic names, as in &quot;Wulfstan&quot;, but especially as second element, in the form &quot;-ulf, -olf&quot; as in 
&quot;Cynewulf&quot;, &quot;Rudolph&quot;, &quot;Ludolf&quot;, &quot;Adolf&quot; etc., it was extremely common. Förstemann explains this as originally motivated by the wolf as an animal sacred to Wodanaz, but notes that the large number of names indicates that the element had become a meaningless suffix of male names at an early time (and was therefore not anymore considered a &quot;pagan&quot; element at the time of Christianisation. Some early missionaries among Germanic folk still used it, like bishop Wulfilas however his family had been adopted earlier by the Goths. By the tenth century, there was clearly no &quot;pagan&quot; connotation left with such names, and saints and bishops bore names such as Wulfstan or Wolfgang). 

Förstemann counts 381 names in &quot;-ulf, -olf&quot;, among which only four are feminine.

==Hypocorisms==

The numerous names in &quot;-wulf, -ulf, -olf&quot; gave rise to hypocorisms from an early time, which were later also treated as given names in their own right. Among such names are the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Offa&quot;, &quot;Yffe&quot;, &quot;Uffa&quot;, &quot;Wuffa&quot;. Corresponding continental forms are &quot;Uffo, Uffi&quot;. The name of the ancient tribe of the Ubii may also be related.

Offa of Angel is a legendary king of the Angles recorded in the 9th-century genealogical tradition of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. Most of this tradition is spurious, but in the case of Offa, a case for possible historicity of a 5th-century figure has been made because of a matching account by Saxo Grammaticus. Offa of Essex and Offa of Mercia are two historical Anglo-Saxon kings. Offa of Mercia is said to have had been named Winfreth originally, and to have been the son of an ealdorman named Tingfrith. Because he miraculously recovered from a state of lameness and blindness as a child, he was called &quot;the second Offa&quot;, after Offa of Angel, whose legend states that he underwent a similar recovery.

Wuffa is recorded as an early kings of the East Angles, eponymous of the Wuffingas dynasty.

The Scandinavian form is &quot;Ulf&quot;, e.g. Ulf the Earl (d. 1026).
The &quot;ylva&quot; in the name of Ingrid Ylva (13th century) is presumably an epithet and not a hypocorism of a dithematic name (i.e. &quot;Ingrid the she-wolf&quot;).

==Surname==

The surname Wulf (and variants) is a typical example of a surname derived from a given name, often a patronymic in origin. These names by their nature can occur repeatedly and independently just based on the prevalence of the given name from which it is derived.
Anglo-Norman variants include Wolfes, Woolf, Woolfe, Woulf, Wulff, Woof, Wooff, etc.

Early instances of this surname in Germany include one Tyle Wulf who lived in Treuenbrietzen in 1375 () and one Nivelung Wolf who was a citizen of Cologne in 1135 ().

Other people with the surname include:
*Andrea Wulf (born 1972), English biographer
*Berthold Wulf (1926–2012), German priest, poet and philosopher
*Christoph Wulf (born 1944), German anthropologist
*Georg Wulf (1895–1927), German aviation pioneer and aircraft manufacturer
*Hermann Wulf (1915-1990), German World War II officer and post-war Generalmajor
*Joseph Wulf (1912–1974), German-Polish-Jewish historian and Holocaust survivor
*Marie Wulf (1685–1738), Danish pietist preacher
*Maurice De Wulf (1867–1947), Belgian philosopher and professor
*Oliver R. Wolf (1897–1987), American chemist, physicist, and meteorologist

<doc id="451436" wikidata="Q3086860" url="?curid=451436" title="Fred Hollows">
<text>Frederick Cossom Hollows (9 April 1929 – 10 February 1993) was a New Zealand–Australian ophthalmologist who became known for his work in restoring eyesight for people in Australia and many other countries through initiatives such as The Fred Hollows Foundation.

==Early life==
Fred Cossom Hollows was the fourth son (the others being Colin, John and Maurice) born at in Dunedin, New Zealand, to &quot;working class father&quot;- &quot;small-time horticulturalist&quot;, formerly a railway fireman, later driver- Joseph Hollows, whose father was of Lancashire origin, and Clarice, daughter of ship&#x27;s cook Frederick Cossom Marshall, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The family lived in Dunedin for the first seven years of his life. He had one year of informal primary schooling at North East Valley Primary School and began attending Palmerston North Boys&#x27; High School when he was 13.
Hollows received his BA degree from Victoria University of Wellington. He briefly studied at a seminary, but decided against a life in the clergy. After observing the doctors at a mental hospital during some charity work, he instead enrolled at Otago Medical School.

While living in Dunedin, he was an active member of the New Zealand Alpine Club and made several first ascents of mountains in the Mount Aspiring/Tititea region of Central Otago. In 1951, Edmund Hillary was on a test run for Everest, and was backpacking up the Tasman Glacier towards Malte Brun Hut; all five were carrying loads of 70 lb (32 kg) or more. Hillary was &quot;met by a young man (Hollows) who came bounding down to meet me and offered to carry my load up to the hut. No one had ever offered to carry my load before, but it was too good an offer to refuse. I handed my pack over and saw his legs buckle slightly at the knees.&quot;&quot;&quot;

Hollows was a member of the Communist Party of New Zealand during the 1950s and 1960s.

Hollows was married twice: in 1958 to Mary Skiller, who died in 1975, and in 1980 to Gabi O&#x27;Sullivan. He first met Gabi in the early 1970s during her training as an orthoptist, and they later worked together on the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program. They would ultimately found The Fred Hollows Foundation together.

Hollows was originally a New Zealand citizen. He declined the award of honorary Officer of the Order of Australia in 1985. He adopted Australian citizenship in 1989 and was named Australian of the Year in 1990. He accepted the substantive award of Companion of the Order of Australia in 1991.

==Medical career==
In 1961, he went to Moorfields Eye Hospital in England to study ophthalmology. He then did post-graduate work in Wales before moving in 1965 to Australia, where he became associate professor of ophthalmology at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. From 1965 to 1992, he chaired the ophthalmology division overseeing the teaching departments at the University of New South Wales, and the Prince of Wales and Prince Henry hospitals.

Early in the 1970s, Hollows worked with the Gurindji people at Wave Hill in the Northern Territory and then with the people around Bourke and other isolated New South Wales towns, stations and Aboriginal communities. Inspired by the missionary ophthalmologist Fr Frank Flynn, he became especially concerned with the high number of Aboriginal people who had eye disorders, particularly trachoma, an eye disease not found elsewhere in the developed world. These visits inspired his life&#x27;s mission to advocate for better access to eye health and living conditions for Indigenous Australians. In July 1971, with Mum (Shirl) Smith and others, he set up the Aboriginal Medical Service in suburban Redfern in Sydney, and subsequently assisted in the establishment of medical services for Aboriginal People throughout Australia.

He was responsible for organising the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists to establish the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program (the &quot;Trachoma Program&quot;) 1976–1978, with funding by the Federal Government. Hollows himself spent three years visiting Aboriginal communities to provide eye care and carry out a survey of eye defects. More than 460 Aboriginal communities were visited, and 62,000 Aboriginal people were examined, leading to 27,000 being treated for trachoma and 1,000 operations being carried out.

===Overseas work===
His visits to Nepal in 1985, Eritrea in 1987, and Vietnam in 1991 resulted in training programs to train local technicians to perform eye surgery. These experiences motivated him to find a way to reduce the cost of eye care and treatment in developing countries. Hollows organised intraocular lens laboratories in Eritrea and Nepal to manufacture and provide lenses at cost, which was about A$10 (approximately US$7.50) each. Both laboratories started production after his death, in 1993.

The Fred Hollows Foundation was launched as an Australian charitable foundation in Sydney on 3 September 1992 to continue the work of Fred Hollows in providing eye care for the underprivileged and poor, and to improve the health of indigenous Australians. The Foundation has also registered as a charity organisation in the United Kingdom where Fred did much of his training, and in his country of birth, New Zealand.

===Opinions regarding HIV/AIDS===
In 1992, Hollows spoke at the Alice Springs National Aboriginal HIV/AIDS Conference, and argued that some areas of the AIDS campaign were being inadequately dealt with at the time. According to &quot;The Australian&quot;&#x27;s Martin Thomas, Hollows stated that some homosexuals were &quot;recklessly spreading the virus&quot;; therefore, the safe sex campaign was an inadequate way of dealing with the issue. To contain the disease, Hollows argued that promiscuity needed to be addressed. Hollows observed the spread of AIDS in contemporary African communities and he was concerned that AIDS would spread as vehemently through Aboriginal communities.

==Death==
Hollows died in Sydney, Australia, in 1993 at the age of 63. The cause of his death was metastatic renal cancer primarily affecting his lungs and brain. He had been diagnosed with the disease six years earlier, in 1987. Upon his death, the Chief Minister of the ACT, Rosemary Follett, described Hollows to her parliamentary colleagues as &quot;an egalitarian and a self-named anarcho-syndicalist who wanted to see an end to the economic disparity which exists between the First and Third Worlds and who believed in no power higher than the best expressions of the human spirit found in personal and social relationships.&quot;

Hollows was given a state funeral service at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Sydney, though he was an atheist. In accordance with his wishes, he was interred in Bourke, where he had worked in the early 1970s. He was survived by his wife Gabi Hollows (an &quot;Australian Living Treasure&quot;), and children Tanya, Ben, Cam, Emma, Anna-Louise, Ruth and Rosa.

A reserve near his old home in the Sydney suburb of Randwick was named Fred Hollows Reserve in 1993. In 1998 the asteroid 12113 Hollows was named after him.

<text>The Juvenile Delinquents Act (), SC 1908, c 40 was a law passed by the Parliament of Canada to improve its handling of juvenile crime. The act established procedures for the handling of juvenile offenses, including the government assuming control of juvenile offenders. It was revised in 1929 and superseded in 1984 by the &quot;Young Offenders Act&quot;.

==Historical background==

===Before Confederation===
Under English common law, there were complex distinctions concerning age, criminal intent and the type of crime involved that determined whether an infant (i.e., one under the age of twenty-five) could be convicted.

For common misdemeanors, particularly in cases of omission, punishment was not given to those under the age of twenty-one, except where there was a notorious breach of the peace, in which case those aged fourteen years or more could be convicted. For capital crimes, since the time of Henry III, those under the age of seven could not be convicted, and those between seven and fourteen were &quot;prima facie&quot; considered to be &quot;doli capax&quot; (except where the court found them capable of distinguishing between good and evil). Proof of malice had to be &quot;strong and clear beyond all doubt and contradiction.&quot;

There has been little investigation as to how the pre-Confederation courts took the age of minor defendants into account. Children and teenagers were forced to serve their sentences alongside adult offenders in typically filthy, overcrowded prisons. There were many instances where justice was uneven and punishment was extreme.

In 1857, the Province of Canada passed its first Acts concerning juvenile offenders, providing special procedures for the trial of persons aged 16 or less, and maximum penalties for larceny (other than by indictment) of three months&#x27; imprisonment or a fine of £5. Minor defendants still had the option of trial by jury, in which case they would be tried as an adult with corresponding punishment. Separate reformatory prisons were established for those under the age of 22 sentenced to terms of five years or less. Under the latter Act, institutions were established at Île aux Noix in Lower Canada (later moved to St-Vincent-de-Paul in Montreal in 1862), and Penetanguishene in Upper Canada. While Canada did not otherwise distinguish their terms from those given to adult offenders, Nova Scotia passed legislation that limited juvenile sentences to 90 days.

===18671908===
In 1868, the new Parliament of Canada provided for the transfer of &quot;incorrigible&quot; juvenile offenders from a reformatory to a penitentiary to serve the remainder of their term. It also provided for the transfer of offenders from a penitentiary to a reformatory, provided that they had been sentenced to a term of at least two years, and had to be &quot;susceptible to reformation.&quot; This was considered to be a regressive step from the measures taken in 1857, and was amended the following year to remove the &quot;susceptible to reformation&quot; requirement and to allow the courts, for terms of not less than six months and not more than five years, to send convicted juvenile offenders to a reformatory. This reflected concerns that those sentenced to terms of greater than five years were at higher risk of recidivism, and were thus beyond the reach of successful intervention.

The former Act of the Province of Canada dealing with trial and punishment was repealed and replaced in 1869 by the Parliament of Canada. The Legislative Assembly of Quebec passed new legislation in 1869 providing for Certified Reformatory Schools, in consequence of which the former Act dealing with young offenders&#x27; prisons was repealed with respect to that province.

In 1875, a federal Act was passed that provided for juvenile offenders to be sentenced to a reformatory for terms of not less than two years and not more than five.

The &quot;Criminal Code&quot; was passed in 1892 to consolidate the criminal law in Canada. The following provisions of it concerned juvenile offenders:

:* Standardization of the age of criminal culpability, so that no juvenile under the age of seven could be convicted, and those between the ages of seven and thirteen could be convicted only where they were &quot;competent to know the nature and consequences of the conduct, and to appreciate that it was wrong.&quot;
:* provision for the trial of juvenile offenders to be conducted without publicity
:* special provisions for the trial of indictable offences
:* the reenactment of the sentencing provisions relating to sentencing to a reformatory, with respect to other offences.

Separate legislation relating to juvenile offenders was later passed in 1894, which provided for the separation of juvenile offenders from older persons and habitual criminals during arrest, confinement, trial and subsequent imprisonment, as well as integrating efforts with those of children&#x27;s aid organizations being organized by the provinces.

There were several provincial initiatives in this period that were designed to complement the federal measures. Ontario passed the &quot;Industrial Schools Act&quot; in 1874, in order to provide institutions to serve neglected and problem children. In British Columbia, the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia passed the &quot;Reformatory Act&quot; in 1890, under which a designated institution could admit those juvenile offenders sentenced to terms of two to five years, boys transferred from jails and incorrigible or misbehaving youngsters between ten and thirteen who needed supervision. There was also provision for remission for good conduct and for binding over to apprenticeship.

===Call for reform===

A Bill to reform the law relating to juvenile offenders was initially introduced to the Senate of Canada in 1907 by Secretary of State for Canada Richard William Scott, but did not pass before that session&#x27;s prorogation. It was reintroduced the following year by Senator Frédéric Liguori Béique, and received Royal assent on 20 July 1908.

In reintroducing the Bill, Senator Béique summarized the philosophy it expressed:

==Operation of act==
The Act was designed to operate in a similar manner to the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 passed by the British Parliament in the previous year, as well as the juvenile delinquent provisions contained in the later Children Act 1908 (8 Edw. 7. c. 67). These built on reforms that had been enacted as early as 1807.

The act&#x27;s preamble declared that &quot;it [was] expedient that youthful offenders should not be classed or dealt with as ordinary criminals, the welfare of the community demanding that they should on the contrary be guarded against association with crime and criminals, and should be subjected to such wise care, treatment and control as will tend to check their evil tendencies and to strengthen their better instincts.&quot;

Its scope was very broad. The definition of &quot;juvenile delinquent&quot; was declared to cover any &quot;child who violates any provision of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; or of any Dominion or provincial statute, or of any by-law or ordinance of any municipality, or who is guilty of sexual immorality or any similar form of vice, or who is liable by reason of any other act to be committed to an industrial school or juvenile reformatory under the provisions of any Dominion or provincial statute.&quot; It also provided that the Juvenile Court had &quot;exclusive jurisdiction in cases of delinquency.&quot;

The Act was designed to be brought into force in different areas on different dates, where provincial law or appropriate facilities made it available for use. In that respect, it first came into force in the City of Winnipeg on 30 January 1909. Thomas Mayne Daly was appointed as the first Juvenile Court judge in Canada.

While the minimum age for those subject to the Act remained at seven years, the maximum age varied by province. By 1982, it was set at 16 in six provinces, 17 for British Columbia and Newfoundland, and 18 for Quebec and Manitoba.

===Coordination with provincial legislation===
The Act was held to be a valid exercise of federal jurisdiction within the scope of its criminal law power.

It provided for integration with provincial legislation concerning the welfare of children:

In considering this provision in 1967, the Supreme Court of Canada held that BC&#x27;s &quot;Motor Vehicle Act&quot; did not fall under s. 39, as it was not intended for the protection or benefit of children, and therefore charges under it could only be heard by the Juvenile Court.

The Act also tended to displace non-judicial initiatives to address the needs of juvenile offenders. In that regard, a Quebec measure that diverted young people from the criminal justice system was held to be unconstitutional.

==Effect==
The objective of the &quot;Juvenile Delinquents Act&quot; was to rehabilitate and reform—not to punish. Young people who broke the law were &quot;delinquents,&quot; not criminals. They were viewed as victims of poverty, abuse, and neglect. Their parents had failed to raise them well, it was reasoned, so the state assumed custody of the child.

Prior to the 1929 revisions of the &quot;Act&quot;, poverty and gender shaped the definition of delinquency with class stereotypes militating against the persecution of wealthier children. Judges regularly saw working-class girls who rebelled as &quot;delinquent&quot; and in need of proper socialization at an industrial school, while middle class girls were more likely to be described as &quot;emotionally unstable&quot; and in need of increased support.

Gender stereotypes, by contrast, ensured that girls were charged for sexual behaviours and expressions considered &quot;non-delinquent&quot; in the male world. Court officials frequently asked girls charged with petty crime (like theft) to describe their sexual experiences. Sexual knowledge or experience often confirmed &quot;delinquency&quot;—a gross misunderstanding. Court officials also prescribed curatives reflective of their sex-related concerns. With state support, &quot;delinquent&quot; girls were to become &quot;proper&quot; women by adopting feminine mores during their probationary period.

Juveniles seldom had lawyers in court. Judges, police and probation officers could impose whatever sentence they thought best for the youth. Because there were no formal guidelines, sentences ranged from incredibly harsh to extremely lenient. The definition of &quot;delinquency&quot; was so broad that youths could be charged for breaking minor laws, including truancy, coming home late, or loitering.

However girls were also able to use the court to speak back to authority, using them to permit alternative sexuality by engaging in premarital sex and justifying it through the intent to marry their partners and speak out against domestic abuse.

If found to be delinquent, juveniles could be sent indefinitely to correctional or training institutions. Staff decided when the delinquent was rehabilitated and could be released. While English-speaking girls who displayed passive or acquiescent behaviour may be released as &quot;transformed,&quot; Sangster has suggested that First Nations girls were less likely to receive approval for &quot;reformed&quot; behaviour. State officials were most likely to view acquiescence as &quot;withdrawal,&quot; keeping First Nations girls in the system longer under the assumption that they would not internalize &quot;proper&quot; feminine mores.

There was no &quot;Charter&quot; to protect a juvenile&#x27;s rights, and no right to a lawyer. Problems with the Act led to demands for changes, and it was revised in 1929.

==Later reform==
In 1982, Solicitor General of Canada Bob Kaplan secured the passage of the &quot;Young Offenders Act&quot;, which replaced the &quot;Juvenile Delinquents Act&quot;. It came into force on 2 April 1984.

<doc id="451445" wikidata="Q861555" url="?curid=451445" title="Cube (algebra)">
<text>In arithmetic and algebra, the cube of a number is its third power, that is, the result of multiplying three instances of together.
The cube of a number is denoted , using a superscript 3, for example . The cube operation can also be defined for any other mathematical expression, for example .

The cube is also the number multiplied by its square:

The &quot;cube function&quot; is the function (often denoted ) that maps a number to its cube. It is an odd function, as

The volume of a geometric cube is the cube of its side length, giving rise to the name. The inverse operation that consists of finding a number whose cube is is called extracting the cube root of . It determines the side of the cube of a given volume. It is also raised to the one-third power.

The graph of the cube function is known as the cubic parabola. Because the cube function is an odd function, this curve has a center of symmetry at the origin, but no axis of symmetry.

==In integers==

A cube number, or a perfect cube, or sometimes just a cube, is a number which is the cube of an integer.
The non-negative perfect cubes up to 603 are :

Geometrically speaking, a positive integer is a perfect cube if and only if one can arrange solid unit cubes into a larger, solid cube. For example, 27 small cubes can be arranged into one larger one with the appearance of a Rubik&#x27;s Cube, since .

The difference between the cubes of consecutive integers can be expressed as follows:

or

There is no minimum perfect cube, since the cube of a negative integer is negative. For example, .

===Base ten===

Unlike perfect squares, perfect cubes do not have a small number of possibilities for the last two digits. Except for cubes divisible by 5, where only 25, 75 and 00 can be the last two digits, &quot;any&quot; pair of digits with the last digit odd can occur as the last digits of a perfect cube. With even cubes, there is considerable restriction, for only 00, 2, 4, 6 and 8 can be the last two digits of a perfect cube (where stands for any odd digit and for any even digit). Some cube numbers are also square numbers; for example, 64 is a square number and a cube number . This happens if and only if the number is a perfect sixth power (in this case 2).

The last digits of each 3rd power are:

It is, however, easy to show that most numbers are not perfect cubes because &quot;all&quot; perfect cubes must have digital root 1, 8 or 9. That is their values modulo 9 may be only 0, 1, and 8. Moreover, the digital root of any number&#x27;s cube can be determined by the remainder the number gives when divided by 3:
* If the number &quot;x&quot; is divisible by 3, its cube has digital root 9; that is, 
*: formula_1
* If it has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, its cube has digital root 1; that is, 
*: formula_2
* If it has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, its cube has digital root 8; that is, 
*: formula_3

===Sums of two cubes===
===Sums of three cubes===
It is conjectured that every integer (positive or negative) not congruent to modulo can be written as a sum of three (positive or negative) cubes with infinitely many ways. For example, formula_4. Integers congruent to modulo are excluded because they cannot be written as the sum of three cubes.

The smallest such integer for which such a sum is not known is 114. In September 2019, the previous smallest such integer with no known 3-cube sum, 42, was found to satisfy this equation:
:formula_5

One solution to formula_6 is given in the table below for , and not congruent to or modulo . The selected solution is the one that is primitive (), is not of the form formula_7 or formula_8 (since they are infinite families of solutions), satisfies , and has minimal values for and (tested in this order).

Only primitive solutions are selected since the non-primitive ones can be trivially deduced from solutions for a smaller value of . For example, for , the solution formula_9 results from the solution formula_10 by multiplying everything by formula_11 Therefore, this is another solution that is selected. Similarly, for , the solution is excluded, and this is the solution that is selected.

===Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for cubes===

The equation has no non-trivial (i.e. ) solutions in integers. In fact, it has none in Eisenstein integers.

Both of these statements are also true for the equation .

===Sum of first &quot;n&quot; cubes===

The sum of the first cubes is the th triangle number squared:

:formula_12

Proofs.
 gives a particularly simple derivation, by expanding each cube in the sum into a set of consecutive odd numbers. He begins by giving the identity

:formula_13

That identity is related to triangular numbers formula_14 in the following way:

:formula_15

and thus the summands forming formula_16 start off just after those forming all previous values formula_17 up to formula_18.
Applying this property, along with another well-known identity:

:formula_19

we obtain the following derivation:

:formula_20
In the more recent mathematical literature, uses the rectangle-counting interpretation of these numbers to form a geometric proof of the identity (see also ); he observes that it may also be proved easily (but uninformatively) by induction, and states that provides &quot;an interesting old Arabic proof&quot;. provides a purely visual proof, provide two additional proofs, and gives seven geometric proofs.

For example, the sum of the first 5 cubes is the square of the 5th triangular number,

:formula_21

A similar result can be given for the sum of the first odd cubes,

:formula_22

but , must satisfy the negative Pell equation . For example, for and , then,

:formula_23

:formula_24

and so on. Also, every even perfect number, except the lowest, is the sum of the first odd cubes (&quot;p&quot; = 3, 5, 7, ...):

:formula_25
:formula_26
:formula_27

===Sum of cubes of numbers in arithmetic progression===

There are examples of cubes of numbers in arithmetic progression whose sum is a cube:

:formula_28
:formula_29
:formula_30

with the first one sometimes identified as the mysterious Plato&#x27;s number. The formula for finding the sum of 
cubes of numbers in arithmetic progression with common difference and initial cube ,

:formula_31

is given by

:formula_32

A parametric solution to

:formula_33

is known for the special case of , or consecutive cubes, as found by Pagliani in 1829.

===Cubes as sums of successive odd integers===
In the sequence of odd integers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, ..., the first &quot;one&quot; is a cube (); the sum of the next &quot;two&quot; is the next cube (); the sum of the next &quot;three&quot; is the next cube (); and so forth.

===Waring&#x27;s problem for cubes===

Every positive integer can be written as the sum of nine (or fewer) positive cubes. This upper limit of nine cubes cannot be reduced because, for example, 23 cannot be written as the sum of fewer than nine positive cubes:

:23 = 23 + 23 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13.

==In rational numbers==

Every positive rational number is the sum of three positive rational cubes, and there are rationals that are not the sum of two rational cubes.

==In real numbers, other fields, and rings==
In real numbers, the cube function preserves the order: larger numbers have larger cubes. In other words, cubes (strictly) monotonically increase. Also, its codomain is the entire real line: the function is a surjection (takes all possible values). Only three numbers are equal to their own cubes: , , and . If or , then . If or , then . All aforementioned properties pertain also to any higher odd power (, , ...) of real numbers. Equalities and inequalities are also true in any ordered ring.

Volumes of similar Euclidean solids are related as cubes of their linear sizes.

In complex numbers, the cube of a purely imaginary number is also purely imaginary. For example, .

The derivative of equals .

Cubes &quot;occasionally&quot; have the surjective property in other fields, such as in for such prime that , but not necessarily: see the counterexample with rationals above. Also in only three elements 0, ±1 are perfect cubes, of seven total. −1, 0, and 1 are perfect cubes &quot;anywhere&quot; and the only elements of a field equal to their own cubes: .

==History==

Determination of the cubes of large numbers was very common in many ancient civilizations. Mesopotamian mathematicians created cuneiform tablets with tables for calculating cubes and cube roots by the Old Babylonian period (20th to 16th centuries BC). Cubic equations were known to the ancient Greek mathematician Diophantus. Hero of Alexandria devised a method for calculating cube roots in the 1st century CE. Methods for solving cubic equations and extracting cube roots appear in &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot;, a Chinese mathematical text compiled around the 2nd century BCE and commented on by Liu Hui in the 3rd century CE.

<text>Coney Island Creek is a tidal inlet in Brooklyn, New York City. It was created from a series of streams and inlets by land filling and digging activities starting in the mid-18th century which, by the 19th century, became a continual strait and a partial mudflat connecting Gravesend Bay and Sheepshead Bay, separating Coney Island from the mainland. The strait was closed off in the early 20th century due to further land development and later construction projects. Today only the western half of Coney Island Creek exists. What once was a thriving fish and oyster population in salt marshes, freshwater streams, and expansive forests is now an unnatural environment wrecked by industrial pollution and construction debris. Urbanization of the city and man-made conditions have led to dumping of sewage and discarded materials, including cars and ship parts. Restoration projects are limited and most conservation efforts are seen to be performed by the local community.

== Course ==
Coney Island Creek extends eastward from Gravesend Bay to Shell Road and separates the west end of Coney Island from the neighborhoods of Gravesend and Bath Beach. The west end of the creek is bordered by Coney Island Creek Park and Kaiser Park on the south side, and Calvert Vaux Park on the north side. The creek is crossed by the Cropsey Avenue and Stillwell Avenue bridges as well as two parallel rail trestles carrying the West End and Sea Beach subway lines (respectively served by the and ). The eastern end is bordered by the Shore Parkway on the north side and Neptune Avenue on the south side. The eastern portion of Coney Island Creek runs along private industrial property and several acres formerly owned by Keyspan, the local electricity provider. The creek terminates at Shell Road where a storm sewer emerges from under the road (designated stormwater outfall CI-641 in city plans).

== History ==

=== Extensions and infilling ===
At the time of European settlement the land that makes up the present day Coney Island was several barrier islands with interconnecting waterways that were all constantly changing shape. Coney Island Creek was once primarily characterized by salt marshes, hardwood forests, and freshwater streams. The waterway that became Coney Island Creek did not originally extend across the back side of the island since part of the land on the west end was a peninsula called Coney Hook. Hubbard&#x27;s Creek, which ran down the eastern side of the peninsula, connected directly with the ocean. In 1750 a 0.25-mile-long canal (called the &quot;Jamaica Ditch&quot;) was dug through the Coney Hook salt-marsh from a creek connecting to Gravesend Bay east to Hubbard&#x27;s creek. This new waterway, allowing shipping traffic to travel from Jamaica Bay to New York Harbor without having to venture out into the ocean, connected Gravesend Bay and Sheepshead Bay together. The waterway behind the islands was called Gravesend Creek in the early 19th century since it cut below the town of Gravesend (later the name was used interchangeably with &quot;Coney Island Creek&quot;). Eventually Hubbard&#x27;s and the other creeks and inlets that separated the islands were filled by a combination of natural process and land development, leaving just a single island that came to be called Coney Island and a single creek behind it that came to be called Coney Island Creek.

In August 1776, the Battle of Brooklyn took place on the marshy fields of Gowanus and Red Hook, where a British invasion force was off of Staten Island, preparing to attack New York City. This battle continued through NY and ended up taking place on the beaches of Gravesend, which marked the beginning of the Battle of Brooklyn. This battle, also referred to as the Battle of Long Island, was the first major armed campaign for the colonies following their Declaration of Independence from Great Britain. This battle resulted in the retreat of General George Washington and the Continental Army from Brooklyn Heights, forcing them to cross the East River and regroup in Manhattan. This battle showcases a significant part of U.S. history that happened at Coney Island Creek.

Coney Island Creek was still a minimally navigable waterway over its 3-mile length through the turn of the 20th century. By the early part of the century, industries started to develop around the creek. This resulted in it becoming polluted with substances including arsenic, cyanide, and benzene. The largest polluters included the Brooklyn Yarn Dye Company and the Brooklyn Union Gas Company.

In a period from the late 19th century through the early 20th century there were plans to turn the creek into the &quot;Gravesend Ship Canal&quot;. It would re-dredge the creek into a canal running in a straight east–west line and fill all the marsh land on either side of the creek to expand the urban grid to the edge of the canal. The plan was eventually abandoned and by 1924 local land owners had filled a portion of the creek. A major section of the creek was further filled in to allow construction of the Belt Parkway in the 1930s. More fill was added in 1962 with the construction of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. This turned Coney Island Creek into an inlet with the western and eastern ends of the island becoming peninsulas. None of the creek remains at the eastern end. That terminus, Sheepshead Bay, has been dredged and, for the most part, enclosed in bulkheads. The path of the landfill of what used to be the creek follows Shore Parkway, Guider Avenue, and the triangular block between Neptune Avenue and Cass Place to a bulkhead at Sheepshead Bay.

=== Current status ===

A northwestern part of the creek is known as a &quot;ship graveyard&quot; for the dead and abandoned ships found there. At the southern shore of the creek, the remains of a yellow submarine, the &quot;Quester I&quot;, protrudes from the water. Built from salvaged metal in the late 1960s, it was never able to maintain an even keel and was abandoned. There are other leftover shipwrecks left in the creek, but there origins are somewhat unknown. They either are left over from The Battle of Brooklyn, or they are left over from when the creek was somewhat active in the 20th century. The creek is also used for performing baptisms.

The health and behavior of marine life in Coney Island Creek have been impacted by environmental factors and human activities in previous years. Pollution from nearby urban development has degraded water quality, leading to harmful substances lingering in the water that could affect marine life. Additionally, the creek&#x27;s confined space and fluctuating tides can trap marine animals, as evidenced by the 2013 incident involving a dolphin that became disoriented and stranded. This dolphin became trapped and was found dead in the creeks waterway. Incidents like these showcase the challenges faced by marine life in adapting to their changing habitat. There is an obvious need for conservation efforts and better management of local waterways to protect these vulnerable species.

In 2016, the New York City government found that a nearby apartment complex, Beach Haven Apartments, was dumping of sewage each day into Coney Island Creek. The complex was fined $400,000 two years later. By late 2016, local residents were advocating the designation of the creek as a Superfund site, which would provide funding to clean the hazardous materials from the creek. Community members testified that auto shops on nearby Neptune Avenue were still dumping cars into the creek. The creek was expected to undergo some minor cleanup between 2018 and 2020. By late 2020, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was considering designating the creek as a Superfund site. In a site inspection, the EPA found toxic levels of cyanide, iron, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the sediment and surface water samples of the Coney Island Creek. However, the EPA has not yet called for an official cleanup of the creek nor designated it as a Superfund site despite the community still using the creek for recreational purposes.

In 2018, the Coney Island History Project opened an exhibition about the history of the Coney Island creek titled: &quot;Coney Island Creek and the Natural World.&quot;

In recent years, there have been several efforts made to help restore the ecosystem of Coney Island Creek, one of which being The Billion Oyster Project. The Billion Oyster Project is a significant initiative aimed at restoring the oyster population in New York Harbor, particularly in areas like Coney Island Creek. In 2018, the Billion Oyster Project focused on Coney Island Creek for several reasons. Historically, this area was home to a thriving oyster population, representing a crucial part of New York Harbor&#x27;s natural heritage. By restoring oysters in Coney Island Creek, the project aims to demonstrate that even urban environments can support healthy ecosystems. The creek has faced significant pollution and degradation over the years, and the project seeks to improve water quality through the natural filtration capabilities of oysters, helping to mitigate the impacts of urban runoff and pollutants. Additionally, Coney Island Creek provides an accessible location for local community engagement and education, encouraging schools and community members to participate in hands-on restoration activities and fostering a sense of stewardship for the environment. The diverse habitats in the creek can benefit from the introduction of oyster reefs, promoting increased biodiversity essential for the overall health of the marine ecosystem. Furthermore, Coney Island Creek is vulnerable to flooding and erosion, particularly during storms, restoring oyster reefs contributes to natural coastal protection, helping to buffer against storm surges and enhance resilience. Overall, the Billion Oyster Project&#x27;s focus on Coney Island Creek reflects a commitment to environmental restoration and community involvement in a vital urban area.

In 2020, the city planned to build a NYC Ferry dock along the creek off Kaiser Park. The ferry dock would be the terminal of a new route to Pier 11/Wall Street; the route, announced in 2019, was to have begun operations in 2021. Local activists rallied against the dock plan, arguing it would disrupt the ecosystems of the creek. There were also concerns that the addition of ferry service would worsen pollution in the creek. The implementation of the Coney Island ferry route was delayed and, in mid-2022, the EDC announced that the ferry route had been postponed indefinitely. One problem was that the sand in the Coney Island Creek shifted frequently, hampering efforts to construct a ferry pier there. Another issue was that the creek itself was heavily polluted, and a Superfund cleanup project was being planned for the creek. Independent news site &quot;Hell Gate&quot; subsequently reported that test boats had repeatedly run aground in Coney Island Creek and that sand had returned to the creek after it was partially dredged in 2021. A ferry in Coney Island Creek also faced much opposition from the local residents who believed it would lead to additional air, water, and noise pollution and reduce safe playing area for children and families.

Despite the recent restoration efforts over the years, Coney Island Creek is still filled with litter from the surrounding urban area and continues to affect the creek to this day. Washed up along the shore line of the creek are various types of garbage including plastic bags, broken pieces of glass. Along the creek bank, dead marine creatures have been found before such as horseshoe crabs, sand crabs, and shark eggs. This continues to demonstrate the need for greater restoration projects to recover Coney Island Creek and allow this ecosystem to become flourishing habitat for its native species once again.

== Biodiversity ==

=== Urban wildlife ===
The Coney Island Creek, though within the highly developed area of Brooklyn, provides a very important habitat for various species, mainly birds, fish, and invertebrates.These tidal estuaries offer a peculiar combination of salt and fresh water that enables the tidal estuary to support various species. This natural variation in salinity, along with the sheltered environment, creates the creek as an important breeding and feeding ground for many species. In a similar way, urban estuaries such as Coney Island Creek support ecological resilience by offering refuge to species and allowing populations to recover after disturbances. For example, meta-population dynamics, where semi-isolated groups of individuals can interbreed across habitats, can enhance the resilience of the native species, even in the urban environments. These environments further allow for adaptation by species to more environmental stressors, such as pollution and variable salinity levels.

The aquatic animals at Coney Island Creek exhibit high plasticity regarding their feeding and reproductive behaviors in response to changes in salinity, sediment conditions and urban runoff. Terrestrial species, including avian populations and small mammals, use urban vegetation and artificial structures like light poles and construction debris as refuge from inclement weather and nesting sites. These adaptations bring out the role of the creek as an important ecological corridor amidst intense urbanization.

=== Terrestrial species ===
As many as 244 bird species have been recorded at Coney Island Creek.Some of the species found at the creek are Horned larks, Snow buntings, and American oystercatchers. The sights of these varying species of birds rely on migratory patterns that are influenced by changing environments, altered magnetic fields, necessity for breeding and food resources.

* Horned larks (&quot;Eremophila alpestris)&quot;: During their migration and winter seasons, the Horned Larks can be found in the large, open areas surrounding Coney Island Creek. They forage on the ground for seeds and insects, and with their brilliant camouflage, they blend well with the sand and litter that defines the creek landscape. They can thus be found here, adding to the importance of providing open and undisturbed patches of natural areas within an urban setting to maintain the populations of migratory birds.

* Snow buntings (&quot;Plectrophenax nivalis)&quot;: This species of bird could be observed on the shores of Coney Island Creek and other nearby sandy or weedy areas in winter. The birds forage for seeds and shelter along the debris zones formed by tidal movements. This adaptation to shoreline habits underscores the role of the creek in providing seasonal resources for migratory songbirds, especially in urban settings where natural habitats are often scarce.
* American oystercatchers (&quot;Haematopus palliatus)&quot;: American Oystercatchers are sentinel shorebird species; they are commonly seen in large numbers during breeding and foraging in Coney Island Creek. These birds show a strong association with intertidal areas, where they forage for shellfish, crabs, and other marine organisms. The tide in the creek and the presence of a variety of food items make it a very vital habitat for these birds, indicating ecological interlinkages between urban waterways and their immediate environments.

=== Aquatic species ===
The Coney Island creek once served as a diverse habitat for fish and shellfish species such as oysters, where they were once found in great numbers. Unfortunately, natural environmental processes have been disrupted by industrial runoff, combined sewer overflows, and habitat degradation. This has led to the loss of certain native species and reduced the overall resilience of the ecosystem. For example, pollution contributes to eutrophication, which depletes oxygen levels in the water, making it challenging for some species to survive. Urbanization has also altered the creek&#x27;s natural flow and salinity, crucial factors for aquatic biodiversity. Some of the native aquatic species found at Coney Island Creek are the striped bass and Atlantic silverside.

* Striped Bass (&quot;Morone saxatilis&quot;): Striped bass are migratory, anadromous fish that utilize Coney Island Creek as a transitional habitat, particularly during migration between spawning grounds in freshwater and feeding grounds in marine environments. These fish are drawn to the creek due to its brackish waters, which offer a mix of saline and freshwater, supporting diverse prey species such as crustaceans and smaller fish. Striped bass play a significant role in the local food web by acting as apex predators, maintaining ecological balance in the creek&#x27;s aquatic ecosystem.
* Atlantic Silverside (&quot;Menidia menidia&quot;): These small schooling fish are abundant in estuarine environments like Coney Island Creek, where they serve as a critical prey species for larger fish and birds. Atlantic silversides thrive in the creek due to its shallow waters, which provide protection from predators. Their high reproductive rate and adaptability to varying salinity levels make them a key component of the creek&#x27;s biodiversity.

=== Conservation efforts ===
Although, there has been some ecological and environmental setbacks, Coney Island creek has been the focus of various conservation efforts aimed at restoring ecological health and enhancing resilience to environmental challenges. Some key initiatives include:
* Long-Term Control Plan (LTCP): To combat the negative impact of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) on Coney Island Creek, the New York City DEP created a Long-Term Control Plan (LTCP). This initiative focuses on upgrading infrastructure and implementing green projects to enhance water quality and protect marine ecosystems.
* Superfund Site Assessment:In response to community concerns about pollution, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted a preliminary assessment of Coney Island Creek. The assessment aimed at determining the extent of contamination that existed and evaluating whether further clean up efforts under the Superfund program was warranted or needed.

These conservation efforts, combined with the Billion Oyster project, represent a collaborative approach by government agencies, community organizations, and environmental groups toward restoring and preserving ecological integrity in Coney Island Creek.

<text>Andrijevica (Cyrillic: Андријевица, ) is a town in Montenegro in the northern region and it is the seat of Andrijevica Municipality. According to the 2023 Census of Montenegro, it had a population of 988.

==History==
The town of Andrijevica is a relatively new settlement, as its first rudiments begin in the middle of the nineteenth century. However, the territory of the municipality is for a long time an area of human activity and a space with numerous settlements that appeared and disappeared during history.

Archaeological research of the &quot;Institute for monuments protection&quot; from Cetinje in 1956 discovered that traces of material culture from the Neolithic period exist in Berane valley. In addition, traces of Illyrian culture were also found, so it can be assumed that the environment of Andrijevica was an ecumenical space of numerous groups of people. Remainders of Roman settlements are also present in Berane valley, as well as in the vicinity of Andrijevica town.

During the Middle Ages, the fort of &quot;Grace&quot; existed, 1 km from today&#x27;s town of Andrijevica. The fort was probably guarding the road along the Lim River, which was part of the main road network between the regions of Raška and Zeta. This period saw emergence of a number of smaller villages and settlements, all of which predate the Andrijevica town.

During the rule of House of Nemanjić, it was noted that the area of Andrijevica was densely populated with Orthodox Christian population. In the Nemanjić era, the center of the area was &quot;Budim grad&quot;, some 15 km from today&#x27;s town. A descendant of the Nemanjić house, Andrija, built a church called Andrijevina, which was razed by the Ottomans in 1765.

In the nineteenth century, the warrior tribe of Vasojevići, which was frequently rebelling against Ottoman rule, began forming a settlement around the new church of &quot;Andrijevina&quot;, which will eventually become Andrijevica. In 1858, Vasojević Duke Miljan Vukov proclaims Vasojevići region a part of Montenegro.

From that point, the settlement gradually expanded into a town, but World War I interrupted its development. Andrijevica was the center of the county (&quot;Okrug&quot;) from 1918 to 1921, and the inter-war period was a time of rapid development for the town.

In July 1944, the German SS Skanderbeg division massacred more than 400 Orthodox Christian civilians in the town. After World War II, the town was first the seat of the district (&quot;srez&quot;), and then of municipality (&quot;opština&quot;) until 1960. Andrijevica was restored with municipality status in 1991.

The economy of Andrijevica was struck heavily by the decline of industry during the Yugoslav Wars, hence the population of the municipality declined slowly but steadily.

==Demographics==
According to the 2023 census, Andrijevica had 988 inhabitants. 
==Sports==
The local football team is FK Komovi, who have spent recent seasons in the country&#x27;s third tier. They play their home games at the Stadion Prljanije. The town&#x27;s handball team is RK Komovi.

==Transport==

Andrijevica is connected with rest of Montenegro by two-laned motorways. Local roads connect Andrijevica with Berane and Kolašin (both around away), where local roads merge with E65/E80 road, which is main road connection of Montenegro&#x27;s coast and Podgorica with northern Montenegro and Serbia. Andrijevica is on the corridor of the future Bar-Boljare motorway.

Podgorica Airport is around away, and has regular flights to major European destinations.

==Tourism==

Andrijevica is surrounded by the mountains of Komovi, Bjelasica and Prokletije, situated on a terrace 40m above river Lim. Tourist activities in the area includes mountaineering (alpinism, hiking), biking, rafting, sports (soccer, basketball), fishing, etc. Main tourist attraction is mountain Komovi (2461 m). This mountain can be accessed by a car in less than 45 minutes, by the mountainous Andrijevica - Mateševo road.

<doc id="451457" wikidata="Q1440281" url="?curid=451457" title="Bottle cap">
<text>A bottle cap or bottle top is a common closure for the top opening of a bottle. A cap is sometimes colorfully decorated with the logo of the brand of contents. Metal caps with plastic backing are used for glass bottles, sometimes wrapped in decorative foil. Metal caps are usually either steel or aluminum, and of the crown cork type. Flip-top caps (like flapper closures) preceded such caps.

Plastic caps are used for plastic bottles, functioning as screw caps, or plastic caps may have a pour spout rather than being detachable. Plastic caps are commonly made from polyethylene or polypropylene, and caps for plastic bottles are often made of a different type of plastic from the bottle.

A cork stopper is another type of closure for the top of a bottle.

== Types ==
Caps were originally designed to be pressed over and around the top of a glass bottle to grab a small flange on the bottleneck.

=== Crown cork ===

The crown cork was patented by William Painter on February 2, 1892 (U.S. Patent 468,258). It had 24 teeth and a cork seal with a paper backing to prevent contact between the contents and the metal cap. The current version has 21 teeth. To open these bottles, a bottle opener is generally used.

The height of the crown cap was reduced and specified in the German standard DIN 6099 in the 1960s. This also defined the &quot;twist-off&quot; crown cap, now used in the United States, Canada, and Australia. This cap is pressed around screw threads instead of a flange and can be removed by twisting the cap by hand, eliminating the need for an opener.

=== Flip-top ===
The &quot;flip-top&quot;, &quot;swing-top&quot; or &quot;Grolsch&quot; style consists of a plastic or ceramic stopper held in place by a set of wires. Prior to the invention of the crown cork, this was the dominant method of sealing bottles that contained carbonated liquid.

=== Other types ===
=== Screw cap ===


Screw on closures are the most common bottle caps. They are easy to apply by a wide variety of automated equipment, or they can be applied by hand.
The application torque of closures, however, must be controlled in order for the closures to perform properly in the field. Closures must be applied tight enough to maintain a seal and to resist closure back-off, but must not be applied so tightly that the end user cannot remove the closure. They are often found on top of beers, such as Coors or Bud Light.

Screw caps were originally an internal thread design. A glass bottle/jar with an internal screw-thread immediately below a gasket-seat, having a beveled seat, was patented by Hyman (Himan) Frank of the William Frank &amp; Sons, Inc. of Pittsburgh, PA. He was awarded patent US 130208 A on August 6, 1872.

In the European Union, the 2021 EU directive on &quot;tethered caps&quot; demands that screw caps of PET beverage bottles under 3 litres (including composite containers, i.e. carton) will have to be afixed to the bottles starting July 2024 in order to reduce waste and improve recycling.

== Closure lining materials ==
===Foamed polyethylene (F217)===
Commonly used with plastic screw caps. F-217 is a soft polyethylene foam core covered on top and bottom with solid, clear polyethylene supplied in 0.050-inch thickness. F217 has become the industry standard due to its all-purpose compatibility, resilient, compressible seal, cleanliness (no pulp dust) and economy. F217 liners have excellent chemical resistance and a low moisture transmission rate. F217 has good taste and odor resistance.

===Plastisol===
Plastisol is the standard lining material used in metal closures for vacuum packing glass bottles and jars. Plastisol is a flowed-in compound, usually a dispersion of PVC resins in plasticizers. It forms a solid, self-bonding, sealing gasket in the closures. Plastisol liners are used in metal twist-off and metal continuous thread screw caps for use on hot-pack food products where the preservation of a vacuum is essential.

===Pressure-sensitive liners (PS 22)===
Styrene foam material coated on the down-facing side with torque-activated adhesive. Pressure-sensitive inner seals adhere to plastic or glass bottles with normal application torque. Pressures sensitive liners are supplied pressed into closures and adhere to the bottle finish when the closure is applied. Pressure-sensitive liners stick to the container because one side is coated with pockets of adhesive. When the closure is applied to the container, the pockets of adhesive rupture between the closure and finish of bottle or jar. The pressure-sensitive liners then stick to the bottle or jar and remain in place when the closure is removed. No extra equipment is required. The closures are supplied with a standard liner as a backing. This material needs a dry land area on the bottle and therefore is suitable only for use with dry products such as vitamins, foods and pharmaceuticals.

===Polyseal cone liners===
Molded in Low-Density Polyethylene, Polyseal cone liners form to the inside of the bottleneck providing a leakproof seal which guards against back-off and product evaporation. Excellent for use with acid products and essential oils, these closures are recommended for use on glass bottles only.

===Linerless designs – land seal (crab’s claw)===
A popular general purpose linerless sealing mechanism which can be used on most all bottles. The design typically features a 0.045” molded inner flange which when applied with normal application torque compresses to approximately one-half of its thickness while sealing against the bottle lip. The liner creates a watertight seal with a bottle having a minimum 0.065” wide sealing surface which is free of nicks, burrs or irregularities. This style linerless mechanism is available in popular dispensing caps and has the advantage of being simpler &amp; cheaper to manufacture.

== Promotional use ==
Soda companies particularly use caps for promotion. A message is printed on the inside of the cap and people with the right message may win a prize. Since the bottle must be purchased to determine the message and win, people usually purchase more of the drink to increase their chances of winning. Some companies print interesting facts, riddles or games on the inside of caps.

A long-running promotion by the Coca-Cola company was the MyCokeRewards program started in 2006, whereby an alphanumeric code printed on the inside of the cap could be entered on Coca-Cola&#x27;s website in return for points.

==In popular culture==

One of the more prominent uses of the conventional metal bottle cap in popular culture is its use in the &quot;Fallout&quot; series of video games. In the series&#x27; post-apocalyptic world, bottle caps, usually shortened simply to &quot;caps&quot;, have been widely adopted as a de facto currency. Although official currencies are used by some of the more developed factions, caps are essentially a universal medium of trade across the wasteland, to the point that the discovery of a working bottle cap press threatens to destabilize the economy.

<text>Mobilization (alternatively spelled as mobilisation) is the act of assembling and readying military troops and supplies for war. The word &quot;mobilization&quot; was first used in a military context in the 1850s to describe the preparation of the Prussian Army. Mobilization theories and tactics have continuously changed since then. The opposite of mobilization is demobilization.

Mobilization institutionalized the Levée en masse (engl. &quot;mass levy of conscripts&quot;) that was first introduced during the French Revolution. It became an issue with the introduction of conscription, and the introduction of the railways in the 19th century.

A number of technological and societal changes promoted the move towards a more organized way of deployment. These included the telegraph to provide rapid communication, the railways to provide rapid movement and concentration of troops, and conscription to provide a trained reserve of soldiers in case of war.

==History==

===Roman Republic===
The Roman Republic was able to mobilize at various times between 6% (81–83 BCE) to as much as 10% (210s BCE) of the total Roman population, in emergencies and for short periods of time. This included poorly-trained militia.

===Modern era===
The Confederate States of America is estimated to have mobilized about 11% of its free population in the American Civil War (1861–1865). The Kingdom of Prussia mobilized about 6–7% of its total population in the years 1760 and 1813. The Swedish Empire mobilized 7.7% in 1709.

Armies in the seventeenth century possessed an average of 20,000 men. A military force of this size requires around 20 tons of food per day, shelter, as well as all the necessary munitions, transportation (typically horses or mules), tools, and representative garments. Without efficient transportation, mobilizing these average-sized forces was extremely costly, time-consuming, and potentially life-threatening. Soldiers could traverse the terrain to get to war fronts, but they had to carry their supplies. Many armies decided to forage for food; however, foraging restricted movement because it is based on the presumption that the army moves over land possessing significant agricultural production.

However, due to new policies (like conscription), greater populations, and greater national wealth, the nineteenth-century army was composed of an average of 100,000 men. For example, in 1812 Napoleon led an army of 600,000 to Moscow while feeding off plentiful agricultural products introduced by the turn of the century, such as potatoes. Despite the advantages of mass armies, mobilizing forces of this magnitude took much more time than it had in the past.

The Second Italian War of Independence illustrated all of the problems in modern army mobilization. Prussia began to realize the future of mobilizing mass armies when Napoleon III transported 130,000 soldiers to Italy by military railways in 1859. French caravans that carried the supplies for the French and Piedmontese armies were incredibly slow, and the arms inside these caravans were sloppily organized. These armies were in luck, however, in that their Austrian adversaries experienced similar problems with sluggish supply caravans (one of which apparently covered less than three miles per day).

Not only did Prussia take note of the problems in transporting supplies to armies, but it also took note of the lack of communication between troops, officers, and generals. Austria&#x27;s army was primarily composed of Slavs, but it contained many other ethnicities as well. Austrian military instruction during peacetime utilized nine different languages, accustoming Austrian soldiers to taking orders only in their native language. Conversely, in an effort to augment the efficacy of the new &quot;precision rifle&quot; developed by the monarchy, officers were forced to only speak German when giving orders to their men. Even one Austrian officer commented at Solferino that his troops could not even comprehend the command, &quot;Halt.&quot; This demonstrates the &quot;communicative&quot; problems that arose quickly with the advent of the mass army.

===Mobilization in World War I===
Intricate plans for mobilization contributed greatly to the beginning of World War I, since in 1914, under the laws and customs of warfare then observed (not to mention the desire to avoid compromising national security), general mobilization of one nation&#x27;s military forces was invariably considered an act of war by that country&#x27;s likely enemies.

In 1914, the United Kingdom was the only European Great Power without conscription. The other Great Powers (Austria-Hungary, Italy, France, Germany and Russia) all relied on compulsory military service to supply each of their armies with the millions of men they believed they would need to win a major war. France enacted the &quot;Three Year Law&quot; (1913) to extend the service of conscripted soldiers to match the size of the German army, as the French population of 40 million was smaller than the German population of 65 million people. The Anglo-German naval arms race began, sparked by the German enactment of the Second Naval Law. Each of the Great Powers could only afford to keep a fraction of these men in uniform in peacetime, the rest were reservists with limited opportunities to train. Maneuvering formations of millions of men with limited military training required intricate plans with no room for error, confusion, or discretion after mobilization began. These plans were prepared under the assumption of worst-case scenarios.

For example, German military leaders did not plan to mobilize for war with Russia whilst assuming that France would not come to her ally&#x27;s aid, or vice versa. The Schlieffen Plan therefore dictated not only mobilization against both powers, but also the order of attack—France would be attacked first regardless of the diplomatic circumstances. To bypass the fortified Franco-German frontier, the German forces were to be ordered to march through Belgium. Whether or not Russia had committed the first provocation, the German plan agreed to by Emperor William II called for the attack on Russia to take place only after France was defeated.
Similarly, the Russian Stavka&#x27;s war planning assumed that war against either Austria-Hungary or Germany would mean war against the other power. Although the plan allowed flexibility as to whether the main effort would be made against Germany or Austria-Hungary, in either case units would be mobilized on the frontiers of both Powers. On July 28, 1914, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia (William&#x27;s cousin) ordered partial mobilization against Austria-Hungary only. While war with Austria-Hungary seemed inevitable, Nicholas engaged in a personal dialogue with the German Emperor in an attempt to avoid war with Germany. However, Nicholas was advised that attempts to improvise a partial mobilization would lead to chaos and probable defeat if, as pessimists on the Russian side expected, no amount of diplomacy could convince the Germans to refrain from attacking Russia whilst she was engaged with Germany&#x27;s ally. On July 29, 1914, the Tsar ordered full mobilization, then changed his mind after receiving a telegram from Kaiser Wilhelm. Partial mobilization was ordered instead.

The next day, the Tsar&#x27;s foreign minister, Sergey Sazonov once more persuaded Nicholas of the need for general mobilization, and the order was issued that day, July 30. In response, Germany declared war on Russia.

Germany mobilized under von Moltke the Younger&#x27;s revised version of the Schlieffen Plan, which assumed a two-front war with Russia and France. Like Russia, Germany decided to follow its two-front plans despite the one-front war. Germany declared war on France on August 3, 1914, one day after issuing an ultimatum to Belgium demanding the right of German troops to pass through as part of the planned pincer action of the military. Finally, Britain declared war on Germany for violating Belgian neutrality.

Thus the entangling alliances of the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente directed the intricate plans for mobilization. This brought all of the Great Powers of Europe into the Great War without actually utilizing the provisions of either alliance.

The mobilization was like a holiday for many of the inexperienced soldiers; for example, some Germans wore flowers in the muzzles of their rifles as they marched. Trains brought soldiers to the front lines of battle. The Germans timetabled the movements of 11,000 trains as they brought troops across the Rhine River. The French mobilized around 7,000 trains for movement. Horses were also mobilized for war. The British had 165,000 horses prepared for cavalry, the Austrians 600,000, the Germans 715,000, and the Russians over a million.

Britain&#x27;s Dominions including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa were compelled to go to war when Britain did. However, it was largely left up to the individual Dominions to recruit and equip forces for the war effort. Canadian, Australian and New Zealand mobilizations all involved the creation of new field forces for overseas service rather than using the existing regimental structures as a framework. In the case of Canada, the Militia Minister, Sir Sam Hughes, created the Canadian Expeditionary Force by sending telegrams to 226 separate reserve unit commanders asking for volunteers to muster at Valcartier in Quebec. The field force served separately from the Militia (Canada&#x27;s peacetime army); in 1920 the Otter Commission was compelled to sort out which units would perpetuate the units that served in the trenches—the CEF or the prewar Militia. A unique solution of perpetuations was instituted, and mobilization during the Second World War did not repeat Sir Sam Hughes&#x27; model, which has been described by historians as being more closely akin to ancient Scottish clans assembling for battle than a modern, industrialized nation preparing for war.
&quot;Colonials&quot; served under British command though, perhaps owing to the limited autonomy granted to the Dominions regarding their respective mobilizations, the Dominions eventually compelled the British government to overrule the objections of some British commanders and let the Dominion forces serve together instead of being distributed amongst various British divisions. The &quot;colonials&quot; would go on to be acknowledged by both the British and German high commands as being elite British units. In May 1918, when command of the Australian Corps passed from William Birdwood to John Monash, it became the first British Empire formation commanded totally free of British officers.

On May 23, 1915, Italy entered World War I on the Allied side. Despite being the weakest of the big four Allied powers, the Italians soon managed to populate its army from 560 to 693 infantry battalions in 1916; the army had grown in size from 1 million to 1.5 million soldiers. On August 17, 1916, Romania entered the war on the Allied side, mobilizing an army of 23 divisions. Romania was quickly defeated however by Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria. Bulgaria went so far as to ultimately mobilize 1.2 million men, more than a quarter of its population of 4.3 million people, a greater share of its population than any other country during the war.

The production of supplies gradually increased throughout the war. In Russia, the expansion of industry allowed a 2,000 percent increase in the production of artillery shells – by November 1915, over 1,512,000 artillery shells were being produced per month. In France, a massive mobilization by the female population to work in factories allowed the rate of shell production to reach 100,000 shells a day by 1915.

Both sides also began drawing on larger numbers of soldiers. The British Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, appealed for hundreds of thousands of soldiers, which was met with an enthusiastic response. 30 new British divisions were created. The response by volunteers allowed the British to put off the introduction of conscription until 1916. New Zealand followed suit, with Canada also eventually introducing conscription with the Military Service Act in 1917.

On April 6, 1917, the United States entered the war on the Allied side. At the entrance, the U.S. only could mobilize its army of 107,641 soldiers, ranked only seventeenth in size worldwide at the time. The United States Navy quickly mobilized, adding 5 dreadnoughts to the Allied navy. However, conscription quickly ensued. By March 1918, 318,000 U.S. soldiers had been mobilized to France. Eventually, by October 1918, a force of 2 million U.S. soldiers joined in the war effort.

===Mobilization in World War II===

Poland partly mobilized its troops on August 24, 1939, and fully mobilized on August 30, 1939, following the increased confrontations with Germany since March 1939. On September 1, 1939 Germany invaded Poland, which prompted both France and Britain to declare war on Germany. However, they were slow to mobilize, and by the time Poland had been overrun by the Axis powers, only minor operations had been carried out by the French at the Saar River.

Canada actually carried out a partial mobilization on August 25, 1939, in anticipation of the growing diplomatic crisis. On September 1, 1939, the Canadian Active Service Force (a corps-sized force of two divisions) was mobilized even though war was not declared by Canada until September 10, 1939. Only one division went overseas in December 1939, and the government hoped to follow a &quot;limited liability&quot; war policy. When France was invaded in May 1940, the Canadian government realized that would not be possible and mobilized three additional divisions, beginning their overseas employment in August 1940 with the dispatch of the 2nd Canadian Division (some units of which were deployed to Iceland and Newfoundland for garrison duty before moving to the UK). Canada also enacted the National Resources Mobilization Act in 1940, which among other things compelled men to serve in the military, though conscripts mobilized under the NRMA did not serve overseas until 1944. Conscripts did, however, serve in the Aleutian Islands Campaign in 1943 though the anticipated Japanese defense never materialized due to the evacuation of the enemy garrison before the landings. Service in the Aleutians was not considered &quot;overseas&quot; as technically the islands were part of North America.

The United Kingdom mobilized 22% of its total population for direct military service, more than any other nation in the WWII era.

Up to 34 million soldiers served in the Red Army during World War II, representing the largest military force in world history. 

=== Post–World War II ===

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, signed a decree on February 24, 2022 on the general mobilization of the population in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Conscripts and reservists were called up over the next 90 days to &quot;ensure the defense of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness&quot;. Men between the ages of 18 and 60 were prohibited from leaving the country.

Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, announced a partial mobilization on 21 September 2022 of existing reservists, most particularly those that have military experience. According to claims of the Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu, 300,000 reservists would be mobilized.

==Economic mobilization==
Economic mobilization is the preparation of resources for usage in a national emergency by carrying out changes in the organization of the national economy.

It is reorganizing the functioning of the national economy to use resources most effectively in support of the total war effort. Typically, the available resources and productive capabilities of each nation determined the degree and intensity of economic mobilization. Thus, effectively mobilizing economic resources to support the war effort is a complex process, requiring superior coordination and productive capability on a national scale. Importantly, some scholars have argued that such large scale mobilization of society and its resources for the purposes of warfare have the effect of aiding in state building. Herbst argues that the demands of reacting to an external aggressor provides a strong enough impetus to force structural changes and also forge a common national identity.

<text>Lorenzo Hervás y Panduro was a Spanish Jesuit and philologist; born at Horcajo, 1 May 1735; died at Rome, 24 August 1809. He is one of the most important authors, together with Juan Andrés, Antonio Eximeno or Celestino Mutis, of the Spanish Universalist School of the 18th century.

==Biography==
Having entered the Jesuit order at Madrid, he studied at Alcalá de Henares, devoting himself with special zeal to architecture and linguistics. For a time he taught at the royal seminary in Madrid and at the Jesuit college of Murcia; then he went to the Americas as a missionary and remained there until 1767, when in connection with the abolition of the Jesuits the establishments of the Society were taken away from the order. Hervás now returned to Europe, taking up residence first at Cesena, Italy, then in 1784 at Rome. In 1799 he went back to his native land, but four years later left Spain and lived in Rome for the remainder of his life. He was held in high honour; Pope Pius VII made him prefect of the Quirinal library, and he was a member of several learned academies. In Italy he had a chance to meet many Jesuits who had flocked thither from all parts of the world after the suppression of the order. He availed himself diligently of the exceptional opportunity thus afforded him of gaining information about remote and unknown idioms that could not be studied from literary remains. The results of his studies he laid down in a number of works, first in Italian, and subsequently translated into Spanish.

== Works ==
The greatest work of Hervás is the huge, Italian treatise on cosmography, (&quot;Idea of the Universe&quot;) (Cesena, 1778–87, in 21 vols. in 4to). It consists of several parts, almost all of which were translated into Spanish and appeared as separate works. 

Of these the most important, which had appeared separately in Spanish in 1784, is entitled (&quot;Catalog of the languages of the known nations, with a class division and numbering according to the diversity of its languages and dialects&quot;) (Madrid, 1800-5 6 vols.). Here Hervás attempts to investigate the origin and ethnological relationship of different nations on the basis of language. The main object of the book, therefore, is not really philological. 

Volume I covers American races and idioms, volume II those of the islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans; the remaining volumes, devoted to the European languages, are inferior in value to the first two. The American dialects are certainly better described and classified than they had been before; the existence of a Malay and Polynesian speech family is established. For determining affinity in languages similarity in grammar is emphasized as against mere resemblance in vocabulary. While there were gross errors and defects in the work, it is conceded that it presented its materials with scholarly accuracy and thus proved useful to later investigators. 

Other parts of the work to appear separately in Italian and later in Spanish were:
* (&quot;Manhood of Men&quot;) (4 vols., 1779–80)
* (&quot;Old age and death of Man&quot;) (1780)
* (&quot;Ecstatic Journey around the World&quot;) (1780)
* (&quot;The History of Earth&quot;) (1781–83, 6 vols.)
* (&quot;Origin, formation, mechanics and harmony of Languages&quot;) (1785)
* (&quot;Vocabulary, Multilingualism, with introduction to more than 150 languages&quot;) (1787)
* (&quot;Wise Language practice with introduction and a collection of dominical prayers in more than three hundred languages and dialects&quot;) (1787)

===Other works===
Hervás wrote a number of educational works for the deaf, the most notable being (&quot;The Spanish School of Art for Deaf-mutes, or the Art of teaching to write and speak the Spanish language&quot;) (Madrid, 1795). He also produced a number of controversial or theological tracts. 

Other miscellaneous works by Hervás include:
* (&quot;Description of the records of the kings of Aragon and Barcelona&quot;)(Cartagena, 1801)
* (&quot;History of Writing&quot;)
* (&quot;Universal Paleography&quot;)
* (&quot;the Moral of Confucius&quot;)
* (&quot;History of the first American colonies&quot;)
* (&quot;The man turned to religion&quot;)

==Linguistics==
Some &quot;lenguas matrices&quot; (language families) listed by Lorenzo Hervás y Panduro are:

#Tupí, Guaraní, Homagua [Omagua-Campeva], and “Brasile volgare” (Tupí-Guaraní languages)
#Guaicurú [Kadiweu], Abipón, and Mocobí (Guaicuruan languages)
#Lule and Vilela (Lule-Vilelan languages)
#Maipure and Moxa [Moxo] (Arawakan languages)

<doc id="451480" wikidata="Q1811372" url="?curid=451480" title="Territory of Alaska">
<text>The Territory of Alaska or Alaska Territory was an organized incorporated territory of the United States from August 24, 1912, until Alaska was granted statehood on January 3, 1959. The territory was previously Russian America, 1784–1867; the Department of Alaska, 1867–1884; and the District of Alaska, 1884–1912.

==Origin==

Passage of the 1899 Criminal Code which, among other things, included a tax on liquor, led to increased calls for Alaskan representation in Congress, and the debate finally ended on August 24, 1912, when the Alaska District became an organized, incorporated territory of the United States.

The &quot;Second Organic Act of 1912&quot; renamed the District to the Territory of Alaska. By 1916, its population was about 58,000. James Wickersham, a Delegate to Congress, introduced Alaska&#x27;s first statehood bill, but it failed for lack of interest from Alaskans. Even President Warren G. Harding&#x27;s unprecedented visit in 1923 (just days before his death) could not create widespread interest in statehood. Under the conditions of the Second Organic Act, Alaska had been split into four divisions. The most populous of the divisions, whose capital was Juneau, wondered if it could become a separate state from the other three. Government control was a primary concern, with the territory having 52 federal agencies governing it.

==Middle 20th century==
In 1920, the Jones Act required U.S.-flagged vessels to be built in the United States, owned by U.S. citizens and documented under the laws of the United States. All goods entering or leaving Alaska had to be transported by American carriers and shipped to Seattle prior to further shipment, making Alaska a &quot;de facto&quot; dependent of the commerce on the state of Washington. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the provision of the Constitution saying one state should not hold sway over another&#x27;s commerce did not apply because Alaska was only a territory. The prices Seattle&#x27;s shipping businesses charged began to rise to take advantage of the situation.

The Great Depression caused prices of fish and copper, which were vital to Alaska&#x27;s economy at the time, to decline. Wages were dropped and the workforce decreased by more than half. In the mid-1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt thought Americans from agricultural areas could be transferred to Alaska&#x27;s Matanuska-Susitna Valley for a fresh chance at agricultural self-sustainment. Colonists were largely from northern states in the Upper Midwest, such as Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota under the belief that only those who grew up with climates similar to that of Alaska&#x27;s could handle settler life there. The United Congo Improvement Association asked the president to settle 400 African-American farmers in Alaska, saying that the territory would offer full political rights, but racial prejudice and the belief that only those from northern states would make suitable colonists caused the proposal to fail.

The exploration and settlement of Alaska would not have been possible without the development of aircraft, which allowed for the influx of settlers into the state&#x27;s interior, and rapid transportation of people and supplies throughout. However, owing to unfavorable weather conditions and the high ratio of pilots to population, over 1,700 aircraft wreck sites are scattered throughout Alaska. Numerous wrecks also trace their origins to the military build-up of the state during both World War II and the Cold War.

Alaska&#x27;s strategic importance to the United States became more apparent during World War II. In April 1942, over 200 people of Japanese origin in the territory were forcibly removed and sent to internment camps inland as a result of Executive Order 9066, which authorized the government to evict and intern any person of Japanese descent from the Pacific Coast. From June 1942 until August 1943 the Japanese invaded the U.S. by way of the Aleutian Islands chain, in the Battle of the Aleutian Islands. This marked the first time since the War of 1812 that American soil was occupied by a foreign enemy. The Japanese were eventually repelled from the Aleutian Islands by a force of 34,000 American troops.

In the spring and summer of 1945, Cold Bay on the Alaska Peninsula was the site of the largest and most ambitious transfer program of World War II, Project Hula, in which the United States transferred 149 ships and craft to the Soviet Union and trained 12,000 Soviet personnel in their operation in anticipation of the Soviet Union entering the war against Japan. At any given time, about 1,500 American personnel were at Cold Bay and Fort Randall during Project Hula.

== Social dynamics ==
During the territorial legislature&#x27;s first session in 1913 a variety of reforms were undertaken including: allowing women to vote, creating an 8-hour work day and other labor regulations, gave autonomy to some Native Alaskan villages, created a board in the territory for education and regulated mining conditions.

The territory did give some Native Alaskans the right to vote in 1915 under the condition that they &quot;gave up tribal customs and traditions.&quot; Alaska did not ratify the 19th Amendment as it was a territory. Racial segregation was practiced in Territorial Alaska toward Native Alaskans lasting until 1945 when the Alaska Equal Rights Act of 1945 was signed into law banning racial segregation and discrimination making it the first law of its kind in the United States.

==Statehood==
On January 3, 1959, Alaska became the 49th state. There was some delay because of concern by members of the national Republican Party that Alaska would elect Democratic Party members to Congress, in contrast to Hawaii, which was also a contender for statehood at the same time and thought to have Republican Party support. In recent years these predictions have turned out to be just the opposite for both states.

==Government==
The Governor of the Territory of Alaska was appointed by the President of the United States and not an elected position. Alaska&#x27;s governor was appointed for a term lasting four years having the power to veto any bill but could be overridden by a 2/3rd vote in the legislature. The Alaska Territory did not have a territorial judiciary system and all matters were taken care of by federal courts.

=== Territorial capitol ===
Alaska&#x27;s territorial capitol had been in Sitka until 1906, when it was moved north to Juneau. Construction of the Alaska Governor&#x27;s Mansion began that same year.

=== Justice and law enforcement ===
Prior to the formation of a dedicated territorial law enforcement agency, law enforcement in Alaska was handled by a various federal agencies for decades including the U.S. Army, Navy, and the Revenue Cutter Service. With the establishment of a civilian government in 1884, the United States Marshals Service also deployed deputy U.S. marshals across the territory. Federal marshals, police departments chartered by cities, and other federal law enforcement officers would serve as the primary means of territorial law enforcement until 1941, when the territorial legislature created the Alaska Highway Patrol. Highway patrolmen only patrolled the main highways of Alaska, and did not visit remote areas or regions. They were commissioned to only enforce traffic laws. They were eventually deputized as special deputy U.S. marshals to fill this void in jurisdiction. The legislature refused to make them police officers until the agency name was changed to Alaska Territorial Police and additional personnel were hired from among the U.S. marshals&#x27; ranks. The agency became the Alaska Territorial Police in 1953, and again changed its title to Alaska State Troopers in 1967.

Prior to statehood, the Federal Bureau of Prisons had correctional jurisdiction over Alaska.

<text>The Department of Alaska was the designation for the government of Alaska from its purchase by the United States of America in 1867 until its organization as the District of Alaska in 1884. During the department era, Alaska was variously under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army (until 1877), the U.S. Dept. of the Treasury (from 1877 until 1879), and the U.S. Navy (from 1879 until 1884). The area later became the District of Alaska, then the Territory of Alaska, then the State of Alaska.

==History==
At the instigation of U.S. Secretary of State William Seward, the United States Senate approved the purchase of Alaska from the Russian Empire for $7,200,000 on April 9, 1867, and the United States flag was raised on October 18 of that same year (now called Alaska Day). Coincident with the ownership change, the de facto International Date Line was moved westward, and Alaska changed from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar. Therefore, for residents, the day after Friday, October 6, 1867, was Friday, October 18, 1867.

On the morning of October 18, 1867, arrived at Sitka with Russian Commissioner Captain Alexis Pestchouroff and American Commissioner General Lovell Rousseau on board. That afternoon, 250 American soldiers, 80 Russian soldiers, Russian-American Company Chief Manager Prince Maksutov and his wife, and a group of locals assembled at the flagstaff in front of the governor&#x27;s residence (on what has come to be known as &quot;Baranof (Baronov) Castle Hill&quot; to witness the lowering of the flag of Russia and the raising of the U.S. flag in its place.

A dual cannon salute was fired for each flag, and each commissioner gave a short speech. Perhaps misunderstanding the directions, the Russian soldier bringing his country&#x27;s flag down tore it loose, then dropped it. The banner drifted down and was caught on a portion of the upraised bayonets of the Russian garrison. Princess Maksutov is said to have fainted at the sight.

Legend has it that the first American administrator of Alaska was Polish immigrant Włodzimierz Krzyżanowski. However, the &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot; was unable to find any conclusive information to support or disprove this claim. Public opinion in the United States was generally positive, though some criticized the purchase as &quot;Seward&#x27;s Folly&quot; or &quot;Seward&#x27;s Icebox&quot;. However, the resources of Alaska would soon show that this was a wise transaction. Alaska celebrates the purchase each year on the last Monday of March, which is known as Seward&#x27;s Day.

When the United States first bought Alaska, vast regions of the area still remained unexplored by Europeans and Lower 48 Americans. In 1865, Western Union decided to lay a telegraph line across Alaska to the Bering Strait, where it would connect with an Asian line. Robert Kennicott, part of a Western Union surveying effort, led his crew to Nulato on the banks of the Yukon. He died the following year, and William Healey Dall took charge of scientific affairs. The Western Union expedition conducted the first scientific studies of the region and produced the first map of the entire Yukon River. That same year, 1866, workers finally succeeded in laying an Atlantic undersea telegraph cable, and the Alaskan overland project was abandoned. Dall returned to Alaska many times, recording and naming geological features.

The Alaska Commercial Company also contributed to the growing exploration of Alaska in the last decades of the 1800s, building trading posts along the interior&#x27;s many rivers. Small parties of trappers and traders entered the interior, and, though the federal government provided little money to the region, army officers would occasionally explore on their own. In a four-month journey, Lt. Frederick Schwatka and his party rafted the Yukon from Lake Lindeman in Canada to Saint Michael near the river&#x27;s mouth on the Bering Sea. In 1885, Lt. Henry T. Allen and four others left the Gulf of Alaska, followed the Copper River, crossed a mountain range, traveled down the Tanana River to the Yukon, and portaged to the Kanuti and Koyukuk rivers. Allen went up the Koyukuk, then back down the Yukon, crossed over to Unalakeet on the coast, and then made his way to Saint Michael, exploring about of Interior Alaska.

<text>An ecclesiastical province is one of the basic forms of jurisdiction in Christian churches, including those of both Western Christianity and Eastern Christianity, that have traditional hierarchical structures. An ecclesiastical province consists of several dioceses (or eparchies), one of them being the archdiocese (or archeparchy), headed by a metropolitan bishop or archbishop who has ecclesiastical jurisdiction over all other bishops of the province.

In the Greco-Roman world, &quot;ecclesia&quot; (; ) was used to refer to a lawful assembly, or a called legislative body. As early as Pythagoras, the word took on the additional meaning of a community with shared beliefs. This is the meaning taken in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures (the Septuagint), and later adopted by the Christian community to refer to the assembly of believers.

In the history of Western world (sometimes more precisely as Greco-Roman world) adopted by the Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire, Christian ecclesiastical provinces were named by analogy with the secular Roman province as well as certain extraterritorial formations of the western world in early medieval times (see Early Middle Ages). The administrative seat of each province is an episcopal see. In hierarchical Christian churches that have dioceses, a &quot;province&quot; is a collection of those dioceses (as a basic unit of administration).

Over the years certain provinces adopted the status of metropolis and have a certain degree of self-rule. A bishop of such province is called the &quot;metropolitan bishop&quot; or &quot;metropolitan&quot;. The Catholic Church (both Latin and Eastern Catholic), the Orthodox Churches and the Anglican Communion all have provinces. These provinces are led by a &quot;metropolitan archbishop&quot;.

==Early history==
Ecclesiastical provinces first corresponded to the civil provinces of the Roman Empire. From the second half of the 2nd century, the bishops of these provinces were accustomed to assemble on important occasions for common counsel in synods. From the end of that century the summons to attend these increasingly important synods was usually issued by the bishop of the capital or metropolis of the province, who also presided over the assembly, especially in the East. Important communications were also forwarded to the bishop of the provincial capital to be brought to the notice of the other bishops. Thus in the East during the 3rd century the bishop of the provincial metropolis came gradually to occupy a certain superior position, and received the name of metropolitan.

At the First Council of Nicaea (325) this position of the metropolitan was taken for granted, and was made the basis for conceding to him definite rights over the other bishops and dioceses of the state province. In Eastern canon law since the 4th century (cf. also the Synod of Antioch of 341, can. ix), it was a principle that every civil province was likewise a church province under the supreme direction of the metropolitan, i.e. of the bishop of the provincial capital.

This division into ecclesiastical provinces did not develop so early in the Western Empire. In North Africa the first metropolitan appears during the 4th century, the Bishop of Carthage being recognized as primate of the dioceses of Northern Africa; metropolitans of the separate provinces gradually appear, although the boundaries of these provinces did not coincide with the divisions of the empire. A similar development was witnessed in Spain, Gaul, and Italy. The migration of the nations, however, prevented an equally stable formation of ecclesiastical provinces in the Christian West as in the East. It was only after the 5th century that such gradually developed, mostly in accordance with the ancient divisions of the Roman Empire. In Italy alone, on account of the central ecclesiastical position of Rome, this development was slower. However, at the end of antiquity the existence of church provinces as the basis of ecclesiastical administration was fairly universal in the West. In the Carolingian period they were reorganized, and have retained their place ever since.

==Provincial church organisation==

===Catholic Church===
====In general====
In the Catholic Church, a province consists of a metropolitan archdiocese and one or more (1–13) suffragan dioceses headed by diocesan bishops or territorial prelatures and missions sui iuris. The archbishop of the metropolitan see is the metropolitan of the province. The delimitation of church provinces in the Latin Church is reserved to the Holy See.

There are exceptions to these rules:
* A few dioceses are not part of any province. Their bishops are exempt from the authority of a metropolitan archbishop, instead reporting directly to the pope. For example, the bishop of the Diocese of Oslo in Norway. 
* A few archdioceses do not belong to provinces and contain no suffragan dioceses. For example, the Archdiocese of Strasbourg in France is not part of a province and has no diocesan bishops reporting to its archbishop. 
* Not all archdioceses are metropolitan sees. Five archdioceses are exempt: Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem; Metropolitan Archdiocese of Udine; Metropolitan Archdiocese of Saint Boniface; Metropolitan Archdiocese of Izmir and Metropolitan Archdiocese of Corfu–Zakynthos–Kefalonia its leader reports directly to the pope. Other non-metropolitan archdioceses, in contrast, are not exempt. Their archbishops report directly to metropolitan archbishops.

The authority of a Latin Church metropolitan over the other sees within his province is now very limited. During a vacancy in a suffragan diocese, the metropolitan names a temporary diocesan administrator if the college of Consultors of the diocese fails to elect one within the prescribed period. A metropolitan generally presides at the installation and consecration of a new bishop in the province. The tribunal of the metropolitan see generally serves as the first court of appeal regarding canonical matters of provincial diocesan tribunals. The metropolitan&#x27;s insignia is the pallium. The article in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; of 1911 on &quot;metropolitan&quot; shows that the metropolitan then had scarcely any more power than now.

In the Eastern Catholic Churches, the patriarchal or major archiepiscopal Churches may also be divided into ecclesial provinces, each headed by a metropolitan. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church has several, two of them in the United States and Canada. Some other Eastern Catholic Churches of a lower category and generally less populous, are known as metropolitanates. They are headed by a single metropolitan, the hierarch of a fixed episcopal see, As head of an autonomous Church, his name is mentioned in the liturgy of that Church immediately after that of the Pope and, in suffragan eparchies, ahead of that of the local hierarch.

====Provincial boundary lines====
The borders of provinces have often been inspired, or even determined, by historical or present political borders; the same is often true of diocesan borders within a province. The following are some examples:

* In France, where the boundaries partly reflected later Roman provinces, most were rearranged in 2002 to fit new administrative regions.
* A comparable process to that of France occurred earlier in Spain.
* In southern Germany, the diocesan boundaries follow the political boundaries that existed between 1815 and 1945.
* In Ireland, the four ecclesiastical provinces fixed by the Synod of Kells in 1152 reflected the contemporary boundaries of the secular provinces, but the ecclesiastical provinces and dioceses do not coincide with the present civil province and county borders. Since the Partition of Ireland in 1920–1922 six dioceses in the province of Armagh straddle the international border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.
* In Scotland, the dioceses, and subsequently the two provinces, follow both civil and geographical boundaries such as rivers.
* In geographically large nations with a sizeable Catholic population, such as the United States, ecclesiastical provinces typically follow state lines, with less populous states being grouped into provinces. In the United States, there are five exceptions:
** California has two metropolitan archdioceses and provinces: Los Angeles and San Francisco.
** Texas has two metropolitan archdioceses and provinces: Galveston-Houston and San Antonio.
** Maryland is unusual in that fourteen of its 23 counties belong to dioceses whose see cities are outside Maryland: (1) the nine counties of Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore (Delmarva Peninsula) are part of the Diocese of Wilmington, Delaware, and (2) the five counties adjacent to the District of Columbia and in southern Maryland are part of the Archdiocese of Washington, which is a different province. Only the remaining nine counties and the City of Baltimore are part of the Archdiocese of Baltimore.
** Fishers Island, a part of Suffolk County, New York, and north of Long Island, is part of the Diocese of Norwich, Connecticut, which is in a different province.
** Those parts of Idaho and Montana that are within Yellowstone National Park are part of the Diocese of Cheyenne, Wyoming, which is in a different province.
:In addition, the Diocese of Gallup (New Mexico) contains two Arizona counties—Apache County and Navajo County—and part of a third county, i.e., those parts of the Navajo and Hopi reservations that are in Coconino County (Arizona). New Mexico and Arizona, however, together form one province.
* Many countries contain more than one province, except those with a small population or few Catholics.
* In at least one case, a province contains dioceses that are in more than one nation, e.g., the Province of Samoa-Apia, of which the metropolitan see (the Archdiocese of Samoa-Apia) is in the Independent State of Samoa, and its only suffragan see (the Diocese of Samoa-Pago Pago) is in American Samoa (an unincorporated territory of the United States). Even individual dioceses, let alone ecclesiastical provinces, can comprise more than one state: examples are San Marino-Montefeltro (San Marino and part of Italy), Urgell (Andorra and part of Spain), and the Diocese of Rome itself (Vatican City and part of Italy).

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
Historical development of ecclesiastical provinces in the Eastern Orthodox Church was influenced by strong tendencies of internal administrative centralization. Since the First Ecumenical Council (325), the Archbishop of Alexandria was given supreme jurisdiction over all provinces of Egypt. Similar authority was also granted to Archbishop of Antioch regarding jurisdiction over provinces of Orient. Since the Fourth Ecumenical Council (451), Patriarch of Constantinople was given the right to consecrate metropolitan bishops in all regions that were placed under his supreme jurisdiction. In time, previous administrative autonomy of original ecclesiastical provinces was gradually and systematically reduced in favor of patriarchal centralization. Ancient practice of annual councils of provincial bishops, headed by their local metropolitans, was also abandoned in favor of centralized councils, headed by patriarchs and attended by metropolitan bishops.

The creation of new autonomous and autocephalous jurisdictions was also marked by tendencies of internal centralization. The newly created Archbishopric of Ohrid (1018) was structured as a single ecclesiastical province, headed by an archbishop who had jurisdiction over all of his suffragan bishops. In 1219, autocephalous Serbian Orthodox Church was also organized as one ecclesiastical province, headed by an archbishop with direct jurisdiction over all Serbian bishops. By the end of Middle Ages, each autocephalous and autonomous church in Eastern Orthodoxy was functioning as a single, internally integrated ecclesiastical province, headed by a local patriarch or archbishop.

Only in modern times, some Eastern Orthodox Churches have revived the ancient practice by creating internal ecclesiastical provinces on the middle (regional) level of church administration. In the Romanian Orthodox Church there are six regional metropolitanates, headed by local metropolitans who preside over regional synods of local bishops, and have special duties and privileges. For example, the Metropolitan of Oltenia has regional jurisdiction over four local dioceses. On the other hand, a majority of Eastern Orthodox Churches remain and function as highly centralized church bodies, each of them functioning as a single ecclesiastical province.

=== Protestantism===

====Anglican Communion====

Member churches of the Anglican Communion are often referred to as provinces. Some provinces are coterminous with the boundaries of political states, some include multiple nations while others include only parts of a nation. Some, such as the Church of the Province of West Africa, have the word &quot;province&quot; in their names. These member churches are known as &quot;provinces of the Anglican Communion&quot;, and are headed by a primate, who is usually also styled archbishop, but may have an alternative title such as primus (for example, the Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church), presiding bishop, or moderator.

The word is also used to refer to a grouping of dioceses within a member church, commonly known as a metropolitical province, metropolitan province, or internal province. The Church of England is divided into two such provinces: Canterbury and York. The Anglican Church of Australia has five provinces: New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia, and an extraprovincial diocese of Tasmania. The Anglican Church of Canada has four: British Columbia and Yukon, Canada, Ontario, and the Northern Lights. The Church of Ireland has two: Armagh and Dublin. The Episcopal Church in the United States of America (ECUSA) numbers, rather than names, its nine provinces. In all cases apart from ECUSA each metropolitan or internal province is headed by a metropolitan bishop with the title archbishop.

====Evangelical State Church in Prussia====
The &quot;Evangelical State Church in Prussia&quot;, formed in 1821 (renamed: &quot;Evangelical State Church in Prussia&#x27;s older Provinces&quot; in 1875, Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union in 1922), had ecclesiastical provinces (Kirchenprovinzen) as administrative subsections mostly following the boundaries of those political Provinces of Prussia which formed part of the state before 1866, with some border changes after 1920 following WWI territorial cessions.

==Religious institutes==
The term &quot;province&quot;, or occasionally religious province, also refers to a geographical and administrative subdivision in a number of orders and congregations. This is true of most, though not all, religious communities founded after the year AD 1000, as well as the Augustinians, who date from earlier.

A province of a religious institute is typically headed by a provincial superior. The title differs by each institute&#x27;s tradition (provincial minister for Franciscans; provincial prior for Dominicans; provincial for the Augustinians, simply &quot;provincial&quot; or &quot;provincial father&quot; for the Jesuits and many others, for instance).

The borders of a religious institute&#x27;s provinces are determined independently of any diocesan structure, and so the borders often differ from the &#x27;secular&#x27;, or diocesan, ecclesiastical provinces. The orders&#x27; provinces are usually far larger than a diocese, a secular province, or even a country, though sometimes they are smaller in an institute&#x27;s heartland.

Most monastic orders are not organized by provinces. In general, they organise their administration through autonomous houses, in some cases grouped in larger families. For example, each Benedictine abbey is an independent foundation, but will often choose to group themselves into congregations based on historical connections.

<doc id="451487" wikidata="Q163801" url="?curid=451487" title="District of Alaska">
<text>The District of Alaska was the federal government’s designation for Alaska from May 17, 1884, to August 24, 1912, when it became the Territory of Alaska. Previously (1867–1884) it had been known as the Department of Alaska, a military designation.

The designation as a district meant that Alaska became an incorporated but unorganized territory with a civil government. The governor of the District of Alaska was appointed by the president of the United States.

==Prelude to District status==
At the time of the 1867 Alaska Purchase, legislators in Washington, D.C., were occupied with post–Civil War reconstruction issues, and had little time to dedicate to Alaska. As a department, Alaska was handled as a strategic military area, variously under the jurisdiction of the United States Army until 1877, the United States Department of the Treasury from 1877 until 1879, and the United States Navy from 1879 until 1884.

By 1884, the civilian population had grown to the point where President Chester A. Arthur signed off on the First Organic Act, and appointed a civil government.

==History while a District==


It was the discovery of gold in the Yukon in 1896 that brought attention to the United States&#x27; northern possession. A wave of fortune hunters clamored for passage to the Klondike, but the Klondike was in Yukon Territory, Canada, not Alaska as many a would-be miner believed. Still, the easiest route was by ship to Skagway, or Dyea, in Southeast Alaska. Miners had their choice of two passes across the mountains to the Yukon fields: The Chilkoot Trail, an old Native route, started in Dyea, and the White Pass, also called Dead Horse Trail, was in Skagway. The Chilkoot Trail was a shorter trip but had a considerably steeper climb. The White Pass took a little longer but was at a lower elevation. Skagway and the White Pass trail also had a severe crime problem, organized and led by the infamous badman, Soapy Smith. Smith was killed in Skagway at the Shootout on Juneau Wharf.

Alaska still had plenty of gold of its own, and many who had failed to make their fortunes in the Klondike strike came back to look for it. An earlier strike had established Juneau in Southeast Alaska, and gold was found in Nome in 1899. For several years a prospector named Felix Pedro had been searching in the Tanana Hills of the Interior for a gold-rich creek he had stumbled upon years earlier but had been forced to abandon. As the summer of 1901 drew to a close, Pedro was about to embark with his partner on a 165-mile walk to Circle City for supplies. He met up with E.T. Barnette, who had been forced to disembark from the steamer &quot;Lavelle Young&quot; with his entire load of supplies, some of which he sold to Pedro.

Replenished with supplies, Pedro continued his search in the area, and he finally struck gold in July 1902. Shortly afterward, Barnette&#x27;s outpost was transformed into a booming town. Named Fairbanks in honor of U.S. Senator Charles W. Fairbanks, the settlement grew as more miners and new businesses arrived. The town had shanties on the fringes, but the center offered many of the economic conveniences of the rest of the U.S. Traffic came through the river, and an overland route to Valdez cut days off a trip to the contiguous United States. Eventually, the Tanana Mining District became a huge gold producer, and the metal attracted Americans and Europeans alike. In 1903 the predecessor to the Alaska Railroad began to be built, which would connect from Seward to Fairbanks by 1923, though Alaska still has no railroad connecting it to the lower 48 states.

Many people in Alaska found ways to profit from the gold rushes without actually panning for the metal themselves. At Ruby Creek, a strike in 1907, and a more substantial one in 1910 brought the rush of miners to the area and created the town of Ruby. The steamers the newcomers used required large quantities of wood to keep them moving, and residents along the river supplemented their trapping and fishing by maintaining profitable wood lots. Ruby grew from a tent city in 1911 to a river port and then had running water in summer, a theater, shops, and cafés. By 1917, at the height of the rush, creeks south of Ruby had yielded $875,000 worth of gold.

Other precious and semiprecious metals were being mined in Alaska, too, particularly copper. In 1910, the richest copper mine in the world started operation at Kennicott in the Wrangell-St. Elias Mountains. The mine extracted more than 591,535 tons of copper ore from the earth, and at its peak employed more than 800 workers.

The more traditional ways of life, fishing, in particular, also provided a livelihood for many Alaskans, particularly after canning was introduced. In 1878 businessmen built the first two canneries at Klawock and Sitka. In 1883 the Arctic Pack Company established a cannery at Nushagak Bay in Southwest Alaska, where they were able to exploit the immense runs of salmon. In 1880, two years later, the Alaska Packing Company opened a cannery across the bay, and by 1908, 10 canneries ringed Nushagak Bay in Southwest Alaska. Kodiak&#x27;s first canneries were built in the late 19th century when word of phenomenal fish runs became widespread.

By the turn of the 20th century, commercial fishing was gaining a foothold in the Aleutian Islands. Packing houses salted cod and herring, and salmon canneries were opened. Another traditional occupation, whaling, continued with no regard for over-hunting. They pushed the bowhead whales to the edge of extinction for the oil in their tissue (though in recent years, due to a decline in commercial whaling, their populations have rebounded enough for Natives to harvest many each year without affecting the population). The Aleuts soon suffered severe problems due to the depletion of the fur seals and sea otters which they needed for survival. As well as requiring the flesh for food, they also used the skins to cover their boats, without which they could not hunt. The Americans also expanded into the Interior and Arctic Alaska, exploiting the furbearers, fish, and other game on which Natives depended.

<doc id="451489" wikidata="Q832721" url="?curid=451489" title="Eagle (United States coin)">
<text>The eagle is a United States $10 gold coin issued by the United States Mint from 1795 to 1933.

The eagle was the largest of the five main decimal base-units of denomination used for circulating coinage in the United States prior to 1933, the year when gold was withdrawn from circulation. These five main base-units of denomination were the mill, the cent, the dime, the dollar, and the eagle, where a cent is 10 mills, a dime is 10 cents, a dollar is 10 dimes, and an eagle is 10 dollars. The eagle base-unit of denomination served as the basis of the quarter eagle ($2.50), half eagle ($5), eagle ($10), and double eagle ($20) coins.

With the exceptions of the gold dollar coin, the gold three-dollar coin, the three-cent nickel, and the five-cent nickel, the unit of denomination of coinage prior to 1933 was conceptually linked to the precious or semi-precious metal that constituted a majority of the alloy used in that coin. In this regard the United States followed long-standing European practice of different base-unit denominations for different precious and semi-precious metals. In the United States, the cent was the base-unit of denomination in copper. The dime and dollar were the base-units of denomination in silver. The eagle was the base-unit of denomination in gold although, unlike &quot;cent&quot;, &quot;dime&quot; (or &quot;disme&quot;), and &quot;dollar&quot;, gold coins never specified their denomination in units of &quot;eagles&quot;. Thus, a double eagle showed its value as &quot;twenty dollars&quot; rather than &quot;two eagles&quot;.

The United States&#x27; circulating eagle denomination from the late 18th century through to the first third of the 20th century should not be confused with the American Eagle bullion coins which are manufactured from silver or gold (since 1986), platinum (since 1997), or palladium (since 2017).

==Years of production, and composition==
Gold &quot;eagles&quot; were issued for circulation by the United States Mint from 1795–1933, &quot;half eagles&quot; from 1795–1929, &quot;quarter eagles&quot; from 1796–1929, and &quot;double eagles&quot; from 1850–1933, with occasional production gaps for each type. Except for the double eagle, the diameters of all these denominations were decreased over time. The following table presents the diameters of each of the denominations, in millimeters (mm), according to the first year that diameter was used:

=== 22 karat &quot;standard&quot; gold ===
Originally the purity of all circulating gold coins in the United States was eleven twelfths pure gold (the same 22 karats level as English crown gold) and one twelfth &quot;alloy&quot;. Under U.S. law (Coinage Act of 1792), the alloy was composed only of silver and copper, with silver limited to no more than half of the alloy by weight. Thus, U.S. gold coins had 22/24 (22 kt or 91.667%) pure gold, &quot;at most&quot; 1/24 (0–4.167%) silver, with the remaining fraction, (4.167–8.333%), copper.

The weight of circulating, standard gold, $10 eagles was set at , half eagles at , quarter eagles at . This resulted in the $10 eagle containing of pure gold.

=== Gold content lowered to 89.92% (1834) ===

In 1834, the mint&#x27;s 15:1 legal valuation of gold to silver (i.e. 15 weight units of silver and 1 weight unit of gold have the same legal monetary value) was changed to 16:1, and the metal weight-content standards for both gold and silver coins were changed, because at the old value ratio and weight content, it was profitable to export and melt U.S gold coins. As a result, the specification for &quot;standard gold&quot; was lowered from 22 karat (.9167 fine) to .8992 fine (21.58 kt).

=== Gold content raised to 90.0% (1837) ===
With the Coinage Act of 1837, passed on January 18, 1837, a small change in the fineness of the gold (increased to exactly .900 fine) was made, and the alloy (now 10% of the coin&#x27;s weight) was again legally defined as silver and copper, with silver capped at no more than half. (i.e. 5% of total coin weight) The new standard for the $10 eagle was of .900 fine gold, giving pure gold content of , with other coins proportionately sized.

Between 1838 and 1840, the silver content was reduced to zero—the eagle in 1838, half eagle in 1839, and quarter eagle in 1840, — resulting in U.S. gold coins being 90% gold and 10% copper. Using only copper as the alloy in gold coins matched longstanding English practice (see crown gold). The new standard would be used for all circulating gold coins until U.S. gold coin circulation was halted in 1933.

=== Post-1982 eagle modern commemorative coins ===

As part of its Modern United States commemorative coins program the United States mint has issued several commemorative eagle coins. In 1984, an eagle was issued to commemorate the Summer Olympics, and another eagle was issued in 2003 to commemorate the Wright brothers first flight at Kitty Hawk. The pre-1933 .900 fine gold standard was restored; this would also be used in half-eagle gold commemoratives as well. The coins would be identical in fineness and size to their pre-1933 counterparts of the same face value. In 2000 a unique eagle, the Library of Congress bimetallic eagle, was issued commemorating the Library of Congress; it consisted of equal weights of an approximately .9995 fine platinum core and a .900 fine gold outer ring.

<doc id="451493" wikidata="Q75596" url="?curid=451493" title="Laurentian Mountains">
<text>The Laurentian Mountains, also known as the Laurentians or Laurentides, are a mountain range in Canada. The range is long and ranges in height from with peaks over . The Laurentian Mountains extend across Labrador and Quebec within the Laurentian Upland, which contains foothills in northeastern Ontario. The range is located near the rivers of Ottawa, St. Lawrence, and Saguenay. The Laurentian Mountains primarily stretch across multiple regions in Quebec, with geologic formations such as the Jacques-Cartier Massif located within the range.

The Laurentians Mountains are one of the oldest mountain ranges on earth. The range formed around one billion years ago during the Grenville orogeny, in which the Grenville Province formed, a subdivision of the Canadian Shield. During that time, Laurentia, the geologic core of the Canadian Shield, collided with other continents and formed Precambrian rocks which extend across the range. The mountain range is located around other related geographic features, such as the Monteregian Hills and the Adirondack Mountains.

The Laurentian Mountains are home to vast extents of boreal ecosystems and mixed forests. The southern areas of the range are dominated by black spruce and balsam fir, with areas of white birch. The range is home to various wildlife species. The Laurentian Mountains are an important part of the economy of Quebec, as they have been historically been used for forestry and provide access to tourism and outdoor recreation for people in the region.

==Etymology==
The namesake of the mountains is derived from the term &quot;Laurentide&quot; or &quot;Laurentian&quot;, which is itself derived from the St. Lawrence River. François-Xavier Garneau, author of &quot;Histoire de Canada&quot;, was first to use the term &quot;Laurentien&quot; when he coined the name of the mountains in 1845. Early geologists adopted the name for the complex of metamorphic and igneous rocks in this area, with the terms further being applied to the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Laurentian Shield (Canadian Shield). Garneau applied the new term to the whole range north of the St. Lawrence River. While the region has been popularly referred to as the Laurentians and &quot;Les Laurentides&quot;, it was officially adopted in 1987 as the territory was defined.

==Geography==

The Laurentian Mountains extend from Quebec to Labrador over a distance of 1,448 kilometers (900 miles). They are partially bounded by the Ottawa, St. Lawrence, and Saguenay River. The Laurentian Mountains reside in the Laurentian Upland, which extends as far west as Lake Huron, with foothills extending into northeastern Ontario. Sub-ranges in the upland are the Opeongo Hills, Misquah Hills, Huron Mountains, and the Porcupine Mountains. This region is extensively forested and contains nearly untouched wilderness, with it not being suited for agriculture.

One of Quebec&#x27;s official regions is called Laurentides. The mountain range runs through four other regions; Capitale-Nationale, Outaouais, Lanaudière, and Mauricie. The elevation generally ranges from around 500 m (1,640 ft) to 1,000 m (3,280 ft) with Mont Raoul-Blanchard being its highest peak, at 1,166 m (3,825 ft). Mont Tremblant, Mont Bleu, and Mont des Conscrits are other prominent peaks in the mountain range. Jacques-Cartier National Park is located in this mountain range, which is north of Quebec City, residing in the Jacques-Cartier Massif. The Adirondack Mountains, which are located in northeastern New York, have great similarity to the Laurentian Mountains, consisting of the same type of rocks that are part of the Canadian Shield.

==Geology==

The Laurentian Mountains are one of the oldest mountain ranges in the world, being of Precambrian age, with some regions dating to over one billion years old. The mountain range is between other related geologic features, such as the Monteregian Hills and the older Oka Hills. The mountain range is located within the Grenville orogeny. The rocks of the Laurentian Mountains contain deformation and metamorphic structures that show long periods of tectonic activity occurred. The Grenville Province is a subdivision of the Canadian Shield, and in this area, the oldest rocks of this geologic region are found. These rocks represent a chain of mountains that formed between 1,500 and 900 million years ago. During that time, Laurentia, the geologic core of the Canadian Shield, collided with other continents that were dragged by moving tectonic plates.

==Ecology==

The Laurentian Mountains contain dense boreal forests. It is home to some deciduous trees, such as sugar maple, beech, but are rarely found past the northern boundary of the range. The Laurentian region is also rich in walnut, ash, cherry, linden, and oak. The range also contains bogs. The boreal ecosystem is represented by mixed forests, dominated by black spruce and balsam fir to the south, including areas of white birch. Laurentides Wildlife Reserve, which is located in the range, contains mammals such as black bears, bobcats, raccoons, grey wolves, otters, moose, white-tailed deer and caribou, with birds such as the barred owl, American kestrel, and osprey.

===Tourism===
The Laurentian Mountains are a popular recreational destination in Quebec. The first ski lift in North America was built in the mountain range in 1931, and by the late 1930s, &quot;snow trains&quot; had brought tens of thousands of skiers to the range. In the area, there is skiing, snowboarding, dog sledding, ice climbing, and snowmobiling during winter at Mont-Tremblant, with rafting, kayaking, hiking, camping, and golf through the region during spring, summer, and fall.

===Forestry===
The Laurentian Mountains have been historically used for logging. During the European colonization of North America, colonists were met with a woodland that stretched from the East Coast to the Great Lakes. The forests reached heights of 30 to 85 meters high. While the exports of logging grew, it eventually became a wasteful practice, with the felling of trees leaving huge portions of land vulnerable to erosion. Intensive forestry has not entirely ceased in the region. Public and private forests in Quebec have now been entirely mapped, with information such as the soil, terrain, and waterways, and the species and the age of the trees available. With this data, the chief forester calculates the amount of wood that can be harvested, ensuring the forest is not cut down faster than it can grow back.

<text>Glenmont is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. The United States Census Bureau had combined Glenmont with nearby Wheaton to create the census-designated place of Wheaton-Glenmont, from 2000 to 2010. It had a population of 16,710 in 2020.

==Geography==
Due to its unincorporated nature, the boundaries are difficult to precisely define, but the center of the community is located at the intersection of Randolph Road and Georgia Avenue (Maryland State Highway 97).

== History ==
===Historic homes===
====The Hermitage====

A brick Colonial manor house, named the Hermitage, was built by John Bowie, Jr., in 1750. Bowie&#x27;s father, John Bowie, Sr., was a Scottish immigrant who arrived in America around 1705. John Bowie, Jr. purchased the land for 25cents per acre, and on it he built the Hermitage for his sixteen-year-old son, Allen Bowie, Jr. The property itself was located around where Georgian Forest Park is today. Two years later, John died, and Allen moved to the property. In June 1774, Allen was part of a now-famous meeting at Hungerford&#x27;s Tavern in today&#x27;s Rockville where those in attendance fiercely criticized Great Britain and decided they should stop trading with it. During the American Revolution, Allen Bowie commanded a company of troops, which he funded himself.

Allen&#x27;s son, Washington Bowie, was born in the Hermitage on August 12, 1776. Washington Bowie, nicknamed the merchant prince, later built a mansion at 3124 Q Street NW in Georgetown, which is today called the Bowie-Sevier House. Allen&#x27;s other son, John, inherited the Hermitage after his father died. John was a doctor, and he fought in the War of 1812. 

John Bowie died in 1825, unmarried and without any heirs, and the Hermitage was held in a trust for several Bowie family members. A farmer named J.P. Dodge bought the Hermitage and approximately 160 acres of land in 1865. Dodge owned the house for 35 years until his death in 1900, when his daughters Jacie Dodge and Mrs. Elwood Matthews inherited the Hermitage. 

Southwick Briggs, a floriculturist, bought the Hermitage and 125 acres of land from Matthews in 1914. Briggs spent a lot of money decorating and updating the Hermitage and planting flowers on its land. Briggs and his wife died after ten years of living in the Hermitage, and the property was bought by the Kauffman-Goldnamer Company of Washington. The Hermitage was still standing in 1952, a three-story brick house, painted yellow, with a large front porch and a rear flagstone terrace.

====Hermitage II====

The Hermitage II was a historic house, built of hand-hewn lumber and handmade nails. It was built by William C. Peerce, sometime between 1816 and 1820. It was located around where Layhill Road meets Hathaway Drive today. Peerce owned 1,066 acres of land surrounding the house. He also owned about sixty enslaved people, who lived in several quarters around the property. Edward Palmer bought the Hermitage II and about 180 acres of land in 1905. Francis P. Welsh, a farmer, bought the house from Palmer in 1920. A Washington businessman named Max Walten bought the Hermitage II in 1928.

====Champayne Farmhouse====
The Champayne Farmhouse was built by John R. Champayne around 1860, at what is now 14201 Layhill Road. The house was built on a 114-acre plot of land that Champayne had bought from James Henry Boyd. Champayne put the title of the property in the name of his wife, Ell Champayne (née Beall), because he wanted it to be protected from being acquired by his own family. When talking to his father-in-law, Champayne once said that his own family &quot;would take it as quick as hell would scorch a feather&quot;. At the time Champayne acquired the land, it had been completely covered by a pine forest. Champayne cleared the land, built a home, a blacksmith shop, a stable, a corn house, and a few other buildings on the land. Ell&#x27;s family provided most of the wood for the outbuildings and the fencing. George Bonifant, a neighboring farmer, was impressed with all the improvements that Champayne had added to the land. Ell died in 1874, and title of the land was transferred to a trust.

By 1880, a second story had been added to the house, it had apple and peach trees, and there was a dairy, a wheelwright shop, and a paint shop on the land. That year, the trustee sold the property to Sarah R. Nicholson for $1,827.20. The Nicholson family owned the property for many years to come.

By the 1990s, Champayne Farmhouse was being rented out, but the outbuildings were all in very bad condition and collapsing. In 2005, much of the land surrounding the Champayne Farmhouse was redeveloped and residential homes were built. The Champayne Farmhouse still stands today.

===Naming of the area===
In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the area contained a few houses and small farms lining the Washington–Brookeville Turnpike, as Georgia Avenue was then called. The Hardy family farm was located between current-day Randolph Road and Parker Avenue and stayed in the family for generations. In 1898, Mary Hardy gave the name Glenmont to the area&#x27;s post office at what is now Georgia Avenue and Randolph Road. Annie Lofler was appointed the new postmaster of Glenmont in 1900. Although the post office was closed in 1901, the name for the area stuck, albeit occasionally misspelled as &quot;Glenmount&quot;.

===Glenmont School===
Glenmont&#x27;s first school opened in 1926. Built at a cost of $50,000, the Glenmont School had 136 students enrolled in its first school year. Miss Ruth Burroughs was the first principal. The Glenmont School was located at 12210 Georgia Avenue (then called Brookeville Turnpike), on the site of land to which the Glenmont Fire Station relocated to in 2016. The brick schoolhouse had four classrooms, two special department rooms, and an auditorium. It was built after the consolidation and closure of schools in Aspen Hill, Layhill, and Wheaton. The Glenmont School served students who lived in Glenmont, Aspen Hill, Layhill, and Wheaton. The Cissel-Saxon Post of the American Legion donated an American flag to the Glenmont School in 1928. Major E. Brooke Lee donated a memorial flag pole, which was dedicated in the memory of Paul Latene Hull, who was killed in action in France during World War I.

A school extension designed by V.T.H. Bien was built in 1946, adding office space and a large space used as a gymnasium and cafeteria.

Additional extensions were constructed in 1953, and 1956. Demolition of the original structure compromised the integrity of the overall structure. In 2002, the Maryland Historical Trust (MHT) decided that the school was not eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, because according to the MHT&#x27;s judgment, the school was not an important example of post-World War II suburban development, Glenmont was not a significant part of Montgomery County&#x27;s suburbanization history at the time, and the design of the building was fairly typical for the time.

===Residential development, 1940s–1960s===
Glenmont remained largely undeveloped until after World War II, when suburbanization began with the construction of subdivisions in Glenmont. The State Roads Commission began plans to widen Georgia Avenue in 1948. Commercial and residential development began transforming the rural area known as Glenmont in 1949, with two major developments, Glenmont Village and Glenmont Forest.

In 1947, the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission built the tall Glenmont Water Tower, a multi‐columned elevated water tank with a capacity of . The water allowed for residential growth in and around Glenmont.

Georgia Avenue Baptist Church was built in 1956, and an education wing was added in 1962.

The Americana Glenmont, a residential apartment complex, was built by developer Carl M. Freeman in 1961 and 1965. The complex was designed with modern architecture and a natural, park-like setting. It was later renamed Glenmont Forest.

===Glenmont Shopping Center===
Glenmont Shopping Center is located on the northeast corner of Randolph Road and Georgia Avenue. 

In 1952, Edward C. Baltz, Thornton W. Owen, David S. Moore, and Edward L. Strohecker Sr., announced a plan to construct a shopping center and 1,000 homes on 250 acres at Georgia Avenue, Layhill Road, and Randolph Road. The Glenmont Land and Development Corporation began construction of the shopping center in 1956. The center was not constructed in one building campaign. It was expanded as the developers were able to bring in new businesses. In its original construction, each store had a large plate glass display windows held in by tubular aluminum, known as an &quot;open design.&quot; One portion of the shopping area, known as the &quot;Arcade&quot;, included a 24-lane bowling alley. The alley was named for Alphone &quot;Tuffy&quot; Leeman, who played for the New York Giants in the 1930s and 1940s. By 1957, the shopping center included the bowling alley, a dry cleaner, a hardware store, and a restaurant. A Grand Union supermarket opened in 1959. By 1962, the shopping center included a hairstylist, barber shop, shoe service, insurance agency, Glenmont Inn Restaurant, a Chinese restaurant, a hardware store, a saving a loan association, a High&#x27;s Dairy Store, a glass and mirror store, a bicycle store, a People&#x27;s Drug Store, and a post office.

The Glenmont Shopping Center fell into some disrepair in the early 1990s. Residents of the Glenmont area have repeatedly asked the county and store owners to make safety improvements to the parking lot and to upgrade the facades of the stores. One of the largest obstacles in widespread renovation to the Glenmont Shopping Center is that it is actually divided into 15 different parcels of land that are owned by 12 different property owners. With stable rents, low vacancy rates, and low cost of ownership, the property owners have little motivation for large, coordinated improvements of the shopping center.

== Transportation ==

Glenmont is a suburban crossroads of three major roads, Georgia Avenue (Maryland Route 97), Layhill Road (Maryland Route 182), and Randolph Road.

The Glenmont Metro station serves the area. This underground station, which opened in 1998, is at the east end of the Red Line, and has two large parking garages. From Glenmont, the Red Line heads south through downtown Silver Spring and to the District of Columbia before re-entering Montgomery County at Bethesda, traveling through Rockville, and ending at Shady Grove.

==Government==
The Kensington Volunteer Fire Department has a fire station at the intersection of Randolph Road and Georgia Avenue. The station was designed by architect Ted Englehardy as a large Colonial Revival wing-and-gable building. the exterior of the building is of brick construction and contains an exterior chimney and clock tower.

Montgomery County Police District 4 headquarters is also located at the intersection. The police station was designed by Bagley, Soule &amp; Associates of Chevy Chase in 1958. The construction was completed in 1959. The building has several additions, which reflect a change from the original Colonial Revival design. The complex features traditional details including denticulated cornices, brick laid in American bond course, molded brick surrounds, and double hung sash windows.

The Maryland-National Capital Park Police has its headquarters in an old elementary school on Layhill Road.

===Civic associations===
In October 2008, the Greater Glenmont Civic Association was founded to address crime rates in Glenmont and to encourage the Montgomery County government to revitalize the Glenmont area, just as the county had done in the neighboring Wheaton and Silver Spring areas. According to Greater Glenmont Civic Association documents, crime decreased in the Glenmont area by about 15% as of June 2010. The Greater Glenmont Civic Association won several awards and grants for its activities. The group became defunct in 2014.

Glenmont Exchange was incorporated in 2013 to promote community in the area.

Glenmont Forest Neighbors Civic Association (GFNCA) was created in 2008 to serve the approximately 900 households in the community. The northern boundary is Randolph Road, southern boundary is Henderson and the western boundary is Kendall with Georgia Avenue to the east. This award-winning organization has been able to improve the infrastructure in the community including sidewalks, curbs, street lighting, paving and other traffic and pedestrian safety measures. Quality of life improvements include multiple Little Free Libraries and a new park at the intersection of Georgia and Randolph.

== Housing ==
Glenmont has seven multifamily rental apartment buildings, namely Privacy World, Winexburg Manor, Glenmont Forest, Woodberry Park, The Glen, Westerly Park, and The Oakfield.p. 14 The rest of the area consists of single-family homes and some townhouses. Most of the housing west of Georgia Avenue is older and smaller; east of Georgia Avenue, the homes are newer and larger. However, there are a few sites west of Georgia Avenue where homeowners have demolished small, older homes and built larger, newer homes in their place.

<doc id="451502" wikidata="Q1772356" url="?curid=451502" title="Ocean Ranger">
<text>Ocean Ranger was a semi-submersible mobile offshore drilling unit that sank in Canadian waters on 15 February 1982. It was drilling an exploration well on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, east of St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, for Mobil Oil of Canada, Ltd. (MOCAN) with 84 crew members on board when it sank. There were no survivors.

==History and design==
&quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; was designed and owned by Ocean Drilling and Exploration Company, Inc. (ODECO) of New Orleans. The vessel was a self-propelled large semi-submersible design with a drilling facility and living quarters. It was capable of operation beneath of ocean water and could drill to a maximum depth of . It was described by ODECO as the world&#x27;s largest semi-submersible oil rig to date.

Constructed for ODECO in 1976 by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Hiroshima, Japan, &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; was long, wide, and high. It had twelve anchors. The weight was 25,000 tons. It was floating on two long pontoons that rested below the surface.

The vessel was approved for &#x27;unrestricted ocean operations&#x27; and designed to withstand extremely harsh conditions at sea, including winds and waves. Prior to moving to the Grand Banks area in November 1980, it had operated off the coasts of Alaska, New Jersey and Ireland.

==Sinking==
On 26 November 1981, &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; commenced drilling well J-34, its third well in the Hibernia Oil Field. &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; was still working on this well in February 1982 when the incident occurred. Two other semi-submersible platforms were also drilling nearby: &quot;Sedco 706&quot;, NNE, and &quot;Zapata&quot; &quot;Ugland&quot;, N of &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot;. On 14 February 1982, the platforms received reports of an approaching storm linked to a major Atlantic cyclone from NORDCO Ltd, the company responsible for issuing offshore weather forecasts. The usual method of preparing for bad weather involved hanging-off the drill pipe at the sub-sea wellhead and disconnecting the riser from the sub-sea blowout preventer. Due to surface difficulties and the speed at which the storm developed, the crew of &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; was forced to shear the drill pipe after hanging-off, after which they disconnected the riser in the early evening.

At about 19:00 local time, the nearby &quot;Sedco 706&quot; experienced a large rogue wave which damaged some items on deck and caused the loss of a life raft. Soon after, radio transmissions were heard from &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot;, describing a broken portlight (a porthole window) and water in the ballast control room, with discussions on how best to repair the damage. &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; reported experiencing storm seas of , with the odd wave up to , thus leaving the unprotected portlight at above the water line vulnerable to wave damage. Some time after 21:00, radio conversations originating on &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; were heard on &quot;Sedco 706&quot; and &quot;Zapata Ugland&quot;, noting that valves on &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot;&#x27;s ballast control panel appeared to be opening and closing of their own accord. The radio conversations also discussed the winds and waves up to high. Through the remainder of the evening, routine radio traffic passed between &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot;, its neighboring rigs and their individual support boats. Nothing out of the ordinary was noted.

At 00:52 local time, on 15 February, a mayday call was sent out from &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot;, noting a severe list to the port side of the rig and requesting immediate assistance. This was the first communication from &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; identifying a major problem. The standby vessel, the M/V &quot;Seaforth Highlander&quot;, was requested to come in close as countermeasures against the 10–15-degree list were proving ineffective. The onshore MOCAN supervisor was notified of the situation, and the Canadian Forces and Mobil-operated helicopters were alerted just after 01:00 local time. The M/V &quot;Boltentor&quot; and the M/V &quot;Nordertor&quot;, the standby boats of &quot;Sedco 706&quot; and &quot;Zapata Ugland&quot; respectively, were also dispatched to &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; to provide assistance. At 01:30 local time, &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; transmitted its last message: &quot;There will be no further radio communications from &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot;. We are going to lifeboat stations.&quot; Shortly thereafter, in the middle of the night and in the midst of severe winter weather, the crew abandoned the platform. The platform remained afloat for another 90 minutes, sinking between 03:07 and 03:13 local time.

All of &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; sank beneath the Atlantic: by the next morning all that remained was a few buoys. Her entire complement of 84 workers – 46 Mobil employees and 38 contractors from various service companies – were killed. While the rig was provided with an Emergency Procedures Manual which detailed evacuation procedures, it is unclear how effectively the platform evacuation was carried out. There is evidence that at least one lifeboat was successfully launched with up to 36 crew inside, and witnesses on the M/V &quot;Seaforth Highlander&quot; reported seeing at least 20 crew members in the water at the same time, indicating that at least 56 crew successfully evacuated the rig. The United States Coast Guard report speculated that &#x27;these men either chose to enter the water directly or were thrown into the water as a result of unsuccessful lifesaving equipment launching&#x27;. Rescue attempts by the standby vessels were hampered by the adverse weather conditions and the conclusion that the standby boats were neither equipped nor configured to rescue casualties from a cold sea. The lifeboat capsized during an attempt to tether it to the &quot;Seaforth Highlander&quot;, throwing the men on board into the water, and an emergency raft launched as a last resort missed the men. As a result of the severe weather, the first helicopter did not arrive on scene until 02:30 local time, by which time most if not all of &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot;&#x27;s crew had succumbed to hypothermia and drowned. Over the next week, 22 bodies were recovered from the North Atlantic. Autopsies indicated that those men had died as a result of drowning while in a hypothermic state.

In related activity the following day, the Soviet container ship &quot;Mekhanik Tarasov&quot; was struck by the same weather conditions as &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot;, approximately to the east. The battered Soviet freighter listed dramatically for hours before sinking with the loss of 32 of 37 crew.

==Causes and effects==

The remains of the platform were found by sonar search over the following weeks, resting in an inverted position approximately south-east of the wellhead, surrounded by major items of debris such as the derrick. The platform had capsized bow-first, turning over and striking the sea floor with the forward ends of the platform&#x27;s pontoons. The United States Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation report on the disaster summarised the chain of events as follows:
*A large wave appeared to cause a broken portlight;
*The broken portlight allowed the ingress of sea water into the ballast control room;
*The ballast control panel malfunctioned or appeared to malfunction to the crew;
*As a result of this malfunction or perceived malfunction, several valves in the platform&#x27;s ballast control system opened due to a short circuit, or were manually opened by the crew;
*&quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; assumed a forward list;
*As a result of the forward list, boarding seas began flooding the forward chain lockers located in the forward corner support columns;
*The forward list worsened;
*The pumping of the forward tanks was not possible using the usual ballast control method as the magnitude of the forward list created a vertical distance between the forward tanks and the ballast pumps located astern that exceeded the suction available on the ballast system&#x27;s pumps;
*Detailed instructions and personnel trained in the use of the ballast control panel were not available;
*At some point, the crew blindly attempted to manually operate the ballast control panel using brass control rods;
*At some point, the manually operated sea valves in both pontoons were closed;
*Progressive flooding of the chain lockers and subsequent flooding of the upper deck resulted in a loss of buoyancy great enough to cause the platform to capsize.

A Canadian Royal Commission spent two years looking into the disaster. The joint Federal-Provincial Royal Commission on the Ocean Ranger Marine Disaster found that the crew were not trained, the safety equipment was inadequate, there were no safety protocols for the supply ship, and that the platform itself had a number of flaws. The Royal Commission concluded that &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; had design and construction flaws, particularly in the ballast control room, and that the crew lacked proper safety training, survival suits and equipment. The Royal Commission also concluded that inspection and regulation by United States and Canadian government agencies was ineffective. In addition to key recommendations for Canada&#x27;s offshore oil and gas industry, the commission recommended that the federal government invest annually in research and development for search and rescue technologies, such as improving the design of lifesaving equipment—a commitment that has been met in every fiscal year since 1982. 

==Aftermath==
In August 1983, the wreck of &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; was refloated and sunk in deeper waters by the Dutch firm Wijsmuller Salvage. Since its sinking the previous year, concerns over the wreck&#x27;s position had been made by the federal government. As the wreck of &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; was situated at an approximate 30 metres below the water, the wreck posed a danger to shipping. The operation saw &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; towed upside down with her two pontoons breaking the surface.

Operations had commenced earlier in June. However progress was halted when two salvage divers were killed on the wreck by an underwater explosion on 20 June. A stop-work order on refloating the wreck was declared and an investigation into the incident followed. However, exploratory diving was allowed to continue. A second incident on 26 June saw a third diver killed, believed to have been hit by a dropped object as he attempted to return to the surface.

Lawsuits arising from the sinking were settled out of court with a package cumulatively valued at $20 million.

A permanent monument to those who died was created on the grounds of the Confederation Building, the seat of the provincial government of Newfoundland.

Canadian playwright Joan MacLeod&#x27;s first play &quot;Jewel&quot; (1987) is about the widow of one of the men who drowned in the disaster. It premiered at the Tarragon in 1987 (dir. Andy McKim), and was subsequently produced for radio in English, French, German, Danish, and Swedish.

A documentary film, &quot;The Ocean Ranger Disaster&quot; (2002), was released only in Canada. In fiction, Canadian author Lisa Moore&#x27;s novel, &quot;February&quot; (2009), depicts the life of a woman whose husband died aboard the oil rig. Canadian folk singer-songwriter Ron Hynes wrote a song called &quot;Atlantic Blue&quot; (1988) as a tribute to the crew of &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot;.

In 2009, a non-fiction book, &quot;Rig: An Oral History of the Ocean Ranger Disaster,&quot; written by Mike Heffernan, was published by Breakwater Books.

In January 2012, a non-fiction book, &quot;The Ocean Ranger: Remaking the Promise of Oil,&quot; was published in Canada by Fernwood Publishing. The book&#x27;s author, Susan Dodd, lost her older brother Jim with the sinking of the &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; and watched, for years, as her parents pursued legal struggles with the oil companies.

<text>USS &quot;Permit&quot; (SS-178), a &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the permit. She was laid down as &quot;Pinna&quot;.

==Construction and commissioning==

&quot;Permit&quot;″s keel was laid on 6 June 1935 by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 5 October 1936, sponsored by Mrs. Edith B. Bowen, wife of Harold G. Bowen, Chief of the Bureau of Engineering, and was commissioned on 17 March 1937, Lieutenant Charles O. Humphreys in command.

==Service history==

===Pre-World War II===
Following shakedown, &quot;Permit&quot; operated from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, until 29 November 1937, when she got underway for the Pacific. Transiting the Panama Canal on 10 December, she continued up the West Coast, and arrived at San Diego, California on 18 December to join Submarine Squadron 6 (SubRon 6). For the next 22 months, she cruised the Eastern Pacific, ranging from southern California to the Aleutian Islands and Hawaiian Islands. In October 1939, she got underway for the Philippines to join the Asiatic Fleet.

===World War II===
&quot;Permit&quot;″s first cruises were conducted in Philippine waters during 1940–1941. The two-year period of peace time activity gave the submarine&#x27;s crew valuable training for later war activity. The ship - commanded by Lieutenant Commander Adrian M. Hurst - conducted her first war patrol off the west coast of Luzon from 11 to 20 December 1941. From 22 to 27 December, she made a second patrol in the area. &quot;Permit&quot; embarked members of Admiral Thomas C. Hart&#x27;s staff at Mariveles Bay on 28 December and evacuated them to the Netherlands&#x27; Submarine Base, Surabaya, Java, arriving on 6 February 1942. &quot;En route&quot;, she completed a third war patrol, scouting in waters of the southern Philippines.

The submarine departed Surabaya for her fourth war patrol on 22 February, as the Japanese began to close on Java. On 19 February, got through to Corregidor, which was still holding out against the Japanese. On 13 March, &quot;Permit&quot; sank the scuttled &quot;PT-32&quot; of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three. It was now &quot;Permit&quot;″s turn to penetrate the blockade to the &quot;Rock.&quot; She rendezvoused off Corregidor on the night of 15–16 March, took on board 40 officers and enlisted men (including 36 precious cryptanalysts from the intelligence station, ), and landed her ammunition. She headed for repairs at her new base, Fremantle, Western Australia, after minor damage suffered eluding three enemy destroyers on 18 March.

&quot;Permit&quot; departed Fremantle on 5 May, and until 11 June was engaged in her fifth war patrol off Makassar, Celebes Island and in the enemy shipping route stretching towards Balikpapan, Borneo. She made her sixth war patrol &quot;en route&quot; to Pearl Harbor - from 12 July-30 August - and shortly departed for the United States, entering Mare Island Navy Yard on 9 September for overhaul.

She conducted her seventh war patrol off Honshū, Japan from 5 February-16 March 1943. Towards sunset on 8 March, she attacked a nine-ship convoy with two escorts. Two hits sent &quot;Hisashima Maru&quot; to the bottom. &quot;Permit&quot; departed Midway Island on 6 April for her eighth war patrol in the shipping lanes from the Mariana Islands to Truk Atoll, Caroline Islands, and after several encounters, returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 May. On 7 July, &quot;Permit&quot; launched two torpedoes which sank &quot;Banshu Maru Number 33&quot;. Just after midnight, she spotted a two-ship convoy headed for the Korean coast, and with a salvo of two torpedoes sank &quot;Showa Maru&quot; in five minutes.

At approximately 18:30 on 9 July 1943, &quot;Permit&quot; mistakenly attacked the Soviet oceanographic research ship &quot;Seiner No. 20&quot; with gunfire off Kaiba To and west of Todosima Island, setting the ship ablaze and killing two people. Upon discovering that she was a Soviet ship, &quot;Permit&quot; closed with her and rescued &quot;Seiner No. 20&quot;&#x27;s 12 survivors, seven men and five women. &quot;Seiner No. 20&quot; sank at 19:00. Under escort by the high-speed transport , &quot;Permit&quot; proceeded to the entrance to Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands, where she transferred the survivors to &quot;Kane&quot; on 17 July.

On 20 July 1943, &quot;Permit&quot; joined the submarines and at Midway for the first wartime penetration into the Sea of Japan, to attack shipping carrying raw materials to Japan from Manchuria and Korea.

After this highly successful patrol, &quot;Permit&quot; made her way &quot;via&quot; Dutch Harbor, Alaska, to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 27 July. On 23 August, she departed for photographic reconnaissance of several atolls in the Marshall Islands. Off Kwajalein, she evaded aerial bombs on 3 September and depth charges on 9 September. She made attacks on enemy vessels, damaging several, before returning to Pearl Harbor on 24 September. Her next war patrol was in the Caroline Islands, held from early-January - mid-March 1944.

Her 12th war patrol was in the same region, on lifeguard duty in support of the air strikes on Truk. She remained on station from 7 May to 1 June 1944. On 28 May 1944 a PV-1 Ventura patrol bomber of U.S. Navy Bombing Squadron 148 (VB-148) mistakenly attacked her in the Pacific Ocean in the vicinity of , damaging her with a depth charge . &quot;Permit&quot; suffered no casualties.

&quot;Permit&quot; commenced her 13th patrol with her departure from Majuro Atoll on 30 June, and ended it with her arrival at Brisbane, Australia on 13 August. On 21 September, she departed to relieve on lifeguard duty off Truk, and on 11 November ended her 14th and last war patrol at Pearl Harbor.

After refit, she sailed for the United States on 29 January 1945, and entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 23 February. In mid-May, she sailed to the Submarine Base, New London, Connecticut, to serve as a schoolship until 30 October, when she entered Boston Naval Shipyard for inactivation.

&quot;Permit&quot; decommissioned on 15 November 1945. Her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 26 July 1956; her hulk was sold for scrap to A.G. Schoonmaker, Inc., New York City on 28 June 1958.

LaRoque was defeated in the May 2012 Republican primary by John Bell.

LaRoque was supposed to have redirected loans from the U.S Department of Agriculture to small business owners in rural areas with limited access to capital. He was indicted by a federal grand jury &quot;on charges that he misappropriated money from a federal program...&quot; LaRoque resigned from the legislature in July 2012. LaRoque used the money on salaries, new cars and bejeweled Faberge eggs. He was convicted on 12 counts including theft, money laundering and filing false tax returns though ten charges were later dismissed.(2013)

On August 1, 2013, he was indicted on 12 counts. All but two of the twelve counts were set aside by U.S. Senior District Court Judge Malcolm Howard, due to juror misconduct, and a new trial was ordered. LaRoque pled guilty to aiding and abetting theft.

He was released in May 2017 after serving one year and nine months.

<text>William Robert Grady (born April 30, 1950) was an American Republican party member of the North Carolina House of Representatives representing the state&#x27;s fifteenth House district, including constituents in Onslow County. A businessman from Jacksonville, North Carolina, Grady served twelve two-year terms, the last one of which was the 2009-2010 session. He did not stand for election in 2010.

He was the mayor &quot;pro tempore&quot; of Jacksonville from 1983 to 1986 and was a member of the Jacksonville City Council from 1981 to 1987.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Jacksonville, North Carolina, on April 30, 1950, to William R. and Minne (née Hurst) Grady. His mother’s family – the Hursts – had lived in Onslow County on a farm that is now part of Camp Lejeune for generations; his father, after serving in World War II moved to Onslow County to work at Camp Davis and, later, Camp Lejeune.

Robert attended public schools, graduating from Jacksonville High School, then attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He graduated with a BA degree in history and, later, received a second degree in history (with honors) from Campbell University.

== Political career ==
Robert was elected to the Jacksonville City Council in 1981, serving three terms, including two as Mayor Pro Tem. He was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1986, becoming one of the first Republicans elected to the legislature from Eastern North Carolina. While serving in the House he specialized in Education and the Judiciary, serving on the appropriations committee for Crime Control and Public Safety, which oversees the judiciary, clerks of court offices, prisons, and state law enforcement (the highway patrol, alcohol law enforcement, the SBI and prisons).

He has also served on the appropriations committee for Education which funds the public schools, community colleges and universities, as well as providing state funding for private colleges (Legislative Tuition Grant) and charter schools.

He sponsored legislation to teach university level courses at community colleges and to insure that the academic credits students earn at community colleges will transfer to universities if a student decides to continue his or her education.

As a result of his efforts Coastal Carolina Community College and UNC-Wilmington established one of the first programs that allows students to receive a 4-year degree from UNC-W – without ever leaving Onslow County. Both programs were praised as examples of reducing costs, providing more convenient services and saving taxpayers money.

In the House, Grady also sponsored legislation to establish the Veteran’s Cemetery in Jacksonville and fought, over three sessions, to pass legislation to force the state to refund taxes the government had improperly collected from retired veterans and federal employees. (The state tried to use a technicality to try to keep the retirees’ money).

A popular legislator, Grady was elected and reelected 12 times by large margins. In January, he announced he would not seek reelection and, instead, would run for Onslow County Clerk of Court.

==Personal life==
Robert Grady was married to his wife, Neta Lucas Grady, for 36 years.

<doc id="451536" wikidata="Q7789212" url="?curid=451536" title="Thomas E. Wright">
<text>Thomas Edward Wright (born August 7, 1955) was a Democratic member of the North Carolina House of Representatives who represented the state&#x27;s eighteenth district, including constituents in New Hanover and Pender counties, from 1992 to 2008. An EMS instructor from Wilmington, North Carolina, Wright was serving his eighth term in the House when he was expelled from that chamber in 2008. A jury subsequently convicted him of corruption and embezzlement, sending him to jail for a 6-8 year term.

In 2007, the North Carolina State Board of Elections launched an investigation of Wright&#x27;s campaign finances. The board recommended that Wright be prosecuted. Information revealed in the board&#x27;s hearings led to calls for Wright to resign.

== Charges ==
Wright was then indicted by a Wake County grand jury &quot;on five charges of obtaining property by false pretenses and one charge of obstruction of justice&quot; on December 10, 2007.

A House committee unanimously found probable cause to proceed on eight counts of misconduct in 2008. Acting on that committee&#x27;s final recommendations, the full House voted 109–5 to expel Wright on March 20, 2008. He was the first member of the House expelled since Josiah Turner in 1880.

== Verdict ==
A few weeks later, a jury found him guilty and he was sentenced to 6–8 years imprisonment. Wright had filed in the Democratic primary for his old seat, but was removed from the ballot as a result of his conviction; the Constitution of North Carolina, like those of most other states, does not allow convicted felons to hold office. He was released on May 27, 2014 after six years in prison.

<text>Paul Miller is a former Democratic member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state&#x27;s twenty-ninth House district, including constituents in Durham county. A computer consultant and investment advisor from Durham, North Carolina, Miller served almost three terms in the state House.

Miller borrowed $13,750 in federally insured student loans in 1980 when he was a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. By March 2004, Miller had paid back just $1,700, according to the complaint, and his loan balance had increased to $23,378 with penalties and interest. In December 2004, Miller learned that the government would begin garnishing his wages, so he offered to make monthly payments of $200 to the U.S. Department of Education, the complaint said. Four months later, Miller sent several letters to the garnishment branch of the Department of Education claiming that he had paid the debt in full in 1992 and enclosing copies of five canceled checks from 1992 totaling $20,500. The Department of Education researched the checks and found that instead of being written for $4,100 each as Miller claimed, they had been written for $100 each. Further, the government found that Miller only owed $14,361 in June 1992, not the more than $20,000 he said he had paid.

He resigned amid allegations that he had committed mail fraud when he tried to convince the U.S. Department of Education that he had paid off more than $20,000 in student loans. Miller was arrested June 8, 2006 on charges that he sent copies of doctored checks to the U.S. Department of Education to make it appear that he had paid off more than $20,000 in student loan debt to avoid garnishment of his pay. The U.S. attorney filed a warrant for Miller&#x27;s arrest in U.S. District Court, charging him with making a false, fictitious or fraudulent statement and using the U.S. Postal Service to execute a scheme to defraud.

When confronted in Atlanta with the copies of the checks archived by the Department of Education, Miller did not admit guilt but agreed to participate in an investigation, the complaint said.

In December 2006, Miller was sentenced to a year&#x27;s probation and fined $1,000 by a federal judge. After pleading guilty in September 2006 to falsely claiming he paid more than $20,000, a second charge—that he altered checks to support his claim—was dismissed in an agreement with prosecutors.

<text>Paul Luebke (January 18, 1946 – October 29, 2016) was a Democratic member of the North Carolina General Assembly, representing the 30th House District, which includes constituents in Durham County. A professor of Sociology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Luebke served eleven consecutive two-year term in the state House of Representatives.

==Childhood and education==
Luebke was born on January 18, 1946, in Chicago, Illinois, to Paul and Eunice Luebke. His father was a teacher and education administrator and his mother was a homemaker. Luebke spent his childhood living in Chicago, Detroit and St. Louis. During his high school years he moved to Ankara, Turkey, where his father worked as an education advisor to the Turkish government for the U.S. Foreign Aid Program.

While living in Turkey he studied at Privatschule der deutschen Botschaft, a German embassy school in Ankara, from 1959 until 1962.

After high school, Luebke attended Robert College in Istanbul, Turkey. In 1966 he earned a bachelor of arts in government from Valparaiso University in Indiana. He earned a doctorate in political sociology from Columbia University in 1975.

After graduate school he moved to the Durham area.

==Career==
Luebke taught sociology at Tougaloo College, a historically black college in Jackson, Mississippi, from 1971 to 1975. He taught sociology at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1975 to 1976. Luebke began teaching sociology at UNC Greensboro in 1976 and was awarded tenure in 1982.

He was a member of the sociology faculty at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, specializing in political sociology.

He served on the Raleigh-Durham Airport Authority from 1987 until 1991. He served as a board member of the North Carolina Consumers Council as a consumer rights advocate.

He was elected to the state House of Representatives in Durham&#x27;s District 23, which then had three members, in 1990 and took up his position in 1991.

As of February 2011 Luebke represented District 30 and was a member of the following committees:

*Agriculture

*Public utilities
*Rules, calendar and operations of the House

He was a chairman of the Finance committee and of the select committee on Municipal Annexation, as well as vice-chairman of the Election Law, Campaign Finance Reform and Rules, Calendar, and Operations of the House committees. He was also a member of the Energy and Energy Efficiency committee and the Environmental and Natural Resources committee.

He thought of himself as a &quot;Progressive Democrat&quot; and said that &quot;I am especially proud that, during the 1990s, I led the bipartisan effort to eliminate the state sales tax on groceries; and that, in 2009, I was a primary House sponsor of the Racial Justice Act.&quot; Luebke died of lymphoma on October 29, 2016, at the age of 70, while still in office.

==Books==
Luebke wrote of two books about North Carolina politics: &quot;Tar Heel Politics: Myths and Realities&quot; (1990) and &quot;Tar Heel Politics 2000&quot; (1998).

<doc id="451553" wikidata="Q6838729" url="?curid=451553" title="Mickey Michaux">
<text>Henry McKinley &quot;Mickey&quot; Michaux Jr. (born September 4, 1930) is an American civil rights activist and Democratic member of the North Carolina General Assembly. He represented the state&#x27;s thirty-first House district from 1983 to 2019 and previously served from 1973 through 1977. The district included constituents in Durham County. Upon his retirement, Michaux was the longest-serving member of the North Carolina General Assembly. In the 2007-2008 session, Michaux served as senior chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and chairman of the House Select Committee on Street Gang Prevention.

In 2020, at age 89, Michaux was appointed to fill a seat in the North Carolina Senate temporarily, following the resignation of Sen. Floyd McKissick, Jr.

==Personal life==
Henry M. Michaux Jr. was born on September 4, 1930, to Henry M. Michaux and Isadore M. Coates in Durham, North Carolina, United States.

Representative Michaux and his wife June have two children, Jocelyn and Cicero. He and his wife currently reside in Durham, North Carolina.

==Education==

In 1948, Michaux attended Alice Freeman Palmer Memorial Institute in Sedalia, North Carolina. He later went on to attend North Carolina Central University in Durham, North Carolina, where he received both his Bachelor of Science in Biology in 1952 and his Doctor of Jurisprudence (JD) in 1964. Representative Michaux also did some graduate work in physiology and biochemistry at Rutgers University in New Jersey and in Business Administration and Economics at North Carolina Central University. He holds an Honorary Doctor of Laws from North Carolina Central University as well.

==Career==
An attorney and businessman, Michaux is a native of Durham, North Carolina, and an alumnus of Durham&#x27;s North Carolina Central University. He served in the United States Army Medical Corps from 1952 to 1954 and in the Army Reserves from 1954 until 1960. In the 1950s, Michaux became involved with the civil rights movement, and established a close friendship with Martin Luther King Jr. After serving as an assistant district attorney, he was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1972, having gone into politics at King&#x27;s suggestion. In 1977, Michaux became the first black United States Attorney in the South since Reconstruction when he was appointed to head the office in the Middle District of North Carolina. Following the confirmation of his appointment, Michaux resigned from the House of Representatives on July 18, 1977. Leaving the attorney&#x27;s office at the end of the Carter administration, Michaux ran for Congress in 1982. He returned to the state legislature in 1983.

He is currently still a practicing attorney and is partner at Michaux and Michaux Practicing Attorneys which was established in 1970. Michaux is the current Vice President of Union Insurance and Realty Company and has held this position since 1955.

== Runoff election threshold ==

Michaux polled the most votes in the first round of the 1982 Democratic primary for Congress, but because no candidate received more than 50 percent of the vote, he was forced into a runoff with Tim Valentine. Valentine won the runoff, and Michaux returned to the state legislature. There, he pushed for the elimination of primary runoffs, and eventually the law was changed to lower the threshold to winning 40 percent to avoid a runoff. Had that law been in place and Michaux won the general election in 1982, he would have been the first African-American elected to Congress from North Carolina in the twentieth century.

In 1992, Michaux lost the Democratic primary in the new 12th congressional district to Mel Watt.

==Awards and accolades==

Representative Michaux was inducted into the Black College Alumni Hall of Fame in 2011. His contributions have also been recognized by North Carolina Central University, which renamed its School of Education in his honor in 2007. Michaux has served three terms as the National President of the NCCU Alumni Association as well as terms as a member of the Board of Trustees and the Board of Directors of the NCCU Foundation, Inc.

In November 2022, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper awarded Michaux the North Carolina Award, the highest civilian honor given by the state, for his public service.

==Memberships==

Michaux holds memberships in the National Bar Association, North Carolina Bar Association, and the North Carolina Association of Black Lawyers.
While obtaining his undergraduate degree at North Carolina Central University, Michaux was a member of the Lampodas Club of Omega Psi Phi fraternity where he served as treasurer in 1949.

<doc id="451554" wikidata="Q16017315" url="?curid=451554" title="Bernard Allen (American politician)">
<text>Bernard Allen (August 24, 1937 – October 14, 2006) was a Democratic member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state&#x27;s thirty-third House district, predominantly composed of constituents in Raleigh, North Carolina but including some suburban areas of Wake County.

==Early life and education==
Allen was born on August 24, 1937, and grew up in Allendale, South Carolina. His parents were James Allen, Sr., and the former Louise Hoover. Allen attended Voorhees College for a while, then transferred to St. Augustine&#x27;s College in Raleigh where, in 1962, he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in secondary education. He later earned his master&#x27;s degree in public administration from North Carolina Central University in 1979.

==Career==
After getting his bachelor&#x27;s degree, Allen taught in the Vance County Schools system, eventually working his way into the system&#x27;s administration. He worked for 25 years as a lobbyist for the North Carolina Association of Educators and for the North Carolina Secretary of State.

==Death==
He suffered a mild stroke September 23, 2006, and spent several weeks recuperating at WakeMed. Friends and family said he kept working from his bed until his very last hours. Allen died on October 14, 2006, aged 69.

Allen lived in Raleigh and was married to the former Vivian Sneed. They had two sons.

==Legislative history==
During his term in office, Allen was noted for being one of the primary co-sponsors for the law establishing the North Carolina Education Lottery. He also worked to increase state funding to historically black colleges and universities in the state.

==Electoral history==

===2002===
In 2002, the incumbent for the North Carolina House district 33 was Dan Blue. He decided not to run for re-election, instead choosing to run for the open United States Senate seat. Allen chose to run for the seat and did not face any Democratic party primary. He went on to win the general election over Republican Venita Peyton and Libertarian Jesse Halliday.


===2004===
Allen again faced no Democratic primary in 2004 and went on to defeat Libertarian candidate Steven Hilton in the general election.



===2006===
When he died, Allen was serving in his second term in the state House, and was seeking election to a third. He ran unopposed in the 2006 Democratic primary and was unopposed in the general election. Since it was too close to election date for the ballots to be reprinted, Allen&#x27;s name still appeared on the general election ballot. The former holder of the seat, Dan Blue, was chosen to fill the position.

<text>James Walker Crawford Jr. (born October 4, 1937) is a former member of the North Carolina General Assembly. A Democrat, he represented the state&#x27;s thirty-second House district, including constituents in Granville and Vance counties. A retail developer from Oxford, North Carolina, Crawford served fourteen terms in the state House of Representatives. In his last term he served as one of the chairmen of the House Appropriations committee (and the only Democrat to be a chairman in the Republican-majority House).

Crawford earned a degree in Industrial Relations from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After serving in the United States Navy and as an Oxford city commissioner, Crawford was first elected to the legislature in 1982. He considered a run for Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina in 1988, but dropped out and was re-elected to the House. In 1992, he ran for Lt. Governor, losing in the Democratic primary to Dennis Wicker. Crawford&#x27;s seat in the House was won by Richard H. Moore. When Moore ran for Congress in 1994, Crawford won the seat back. He was re-elected without opposition in 2006. In 2008 and in 2010, he was opposed by Libertarian Barbara Howe.

In 2012, after supporting the budget passed by the House Republican majority and after supporting the bill that put North Carolina Amendment 1 before the voters, Crawford was defeated in the May 8 Democratic primary by fellow Rep. Winkie Wilkins. The Republican majority had placed both Democratic lawmakers in the new 2nd District during redistricting. Crawford endorsed Republican Pat McCrory in the subsequent general election for Governor. McCrory later appointed Crawford to the state Board of Transportation.

<text>Deborah Ross (née Koff; born June 20, 1963) is an American lawyer and politician who has served as the U.S. representative for since 2021. Her district is based in Raleigh. A member of the Democratic Party, Ross served as a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives from 2003 to 2013, representing the state&#x27;s 38th and then 34th House district, including much of northern Raleigh and surrounding suburbs in Wake County.

Ross was the Democratic nominee in the 2016 U.S. Senate election in North Carolina, unsuccessfully challenging Republican incumbent Richard Burr in the general election.

== Early life and education ==
Ross was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on June 20, 1963, and grew up in Connecticut. She is the daughter of Barbara (née Klein) and Marvin Koff. Her father was an Air Force physician and her mother was a teacher.

Ross earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from Brown University in 1985 and her Juris Doctor from the University of North Carolina School of Law in 1990.

== Legal career ==
After graduating from law school, Ross worked for Raleigh-based Hunton &amp; Williams as a tax litigator and municipal bond lawyer. She taught at Duke Law School as a senior lecturing fellow.

=== American Civil Liberties Union ===
Ross was hired as state director for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of North Carolina in 1994. She worked on First Amendment and juvenile justice issues. Alongside Governor Jim Hunt and then State Senator Roy Cooper, she overhauled North Carolina&#x27;s system for dealing with youth offenders. In response to racial profiling reports, she also successfully encouraged state police agencies to collect race-based statistics for traffic stops. Ross stepped down from her position at the ACLU in 2002 when she launched her state House campaign.

=== GoTriangle ===
On May 1, 2013, Ross announced she would resign from the legislature in June to serve as legal counsel for GoTriangle, the triangle area&#x27;s regional transit agency. On June 1, 2013, Grier Martin was appointed to succeed her in the House.

=== Smith Moore Leatherwood LLP ===
In March 2017, Ross joined the regional law firm of Smith Moore Leatherwood LLP in Raleigh. Her practice focused on the economic development, energy, utilities, and infrastructure needs of businesses and government. Smith Moore Leatherwood combined with national law firm Fox Rothschild, LLP, on November 1, 2018.

== Early political career ==

=== North Carolina legislature ===
Ross was first elected to the North Carolina General Assembly in 2002 and defeated Wake County Commissioner Phil Jeffreys in 2004 to win a second term. She faced no opposition in the 2006 general election, and in 2007, Ross was first elected as one of the House Democratic Whips.

Ross supported the Equal Pay Act, an unsuccessful bill that would have banned North Carolina employers from paying workers differently based on gender.

In 2012, Ross compared state coastal protection policies that ignore scientists&#x27; sea level rise forecasts to burying one&#x27;s &quot;head in the sand&quot;. She said she was concerned that increased risk of flooding would lead insurance companies to charge higher premiums for coastal property owners.

=== 2016 U.S. Senate campaign ===
In 2015, Ross resigned as legal counsel at GoTriangle to run for the U.S. Senate in 2016. She won the March 2016 Democratic primary with 62.4% of the vote from a field of four candidates. Ross was endorsed by EMILY&#x27;s List, Planned Parenthood, the North Carolina Association of Educators, the North Carolina AFL–CIO, American Association for Justice, End Citizens United, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Democracy for America, and the League of Conservation Voters.

In the general election, Ross ran against the incumbent, Republican Richard Burr. Ross raised more money than Burr for three consecutive quarters, but nevertheless had less cash on hand as Burr began the year with $5.3 million in campaign funds. As of October 21, Ross was down 2.8% in the Real Clear Politics average of polls. The race received national attention as &quot;The Cook Political Report&quot; rated the race a toss-up and Democrats viewed the seat as one they could win. Burr won with 51% of the vote.

==U.S. House of Representatives ==
=== Elections ===

==== 2020 ====

On December 2, 2019, Ross announced her candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives in North Carolina&#x27;s newly redrawn 2nd congressional district in 2020. She jumped into the race shortly after a court-ordered redistricting cut the 2nd back to southern Wake County, including almost all of Raleigh. The old 2nd covered roughly half of Wake County, along with several exurbs south and east of the capital.

Had the district existed in 2016, Hillary Clinton would have carried it with 60% of the vote and defeated Donald Trump by over 24 points. By comparison, Trump carried the old 2nd with 53% of the vote, defeating Clinton by 12 points. On paper, the new map turned the 2nd from a Republican-leaning district into a safely Democratic district.

With pundits suggesting that the 2nd was a likely Democratic pickup, Republican incumbent George Holding, who had represented much of the area for two terms in the 13th district before it was essentially merged with the 2nd in 2016, opted to retire. Holding said that the significantly bluer hue of the new 2nd figured significantly in his decision.

Ross won the Democratic primary on March 3. She won the general election on November 3, defeating Republican nominee Alan Swain and Libertarian Jeff Matemu.

===Tenure===
On July 1, 2021, Ross and Mariannette Miller-Meeks introduced the America&#x27;s CHILDREN Act. If enacted, the bill would grant a pathway to permanent residency for children who grew up in the United States legally but were blocked from obtaining permanent residency due to green card backlogs and other legal barriers.

=== Committee assignments ===

* Committee on the Judiciary
** Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet
*Committee on Rules
*Committee on Science, Space and Technology
**Subcommittee on Energy
**Subcommittee on Research and Technology

=== Caucus memberships ===
* New Democrat Coalition
* Democratic Women’s Caucus
* Rare Disease Caucus

== Political positions ==
Ross has supported legislation that expands tax credits for families. She voted for the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which increased the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $3,000 per child aged 6 to 17 and to $3,600 for children under 6, with payments distributed monthly instead of as a lump sum.

She supported legislation that expanded premium subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and offered financial incentives to states that had not yet expanded Medicaid under the ACA. 

She voted for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 which provided $8 billion of funding for highways and public transportation in North Carolina. The legislation also directed funds toward expanding broadband access in rural communities and replacing lead water pipes nationwide.

Ross supported the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, a $280 billion bill aimed at increasing U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. Following its passage, semiconductor manufacturer Wolfspeed announced plans to build a $5 billion production facility in Chatham County.

==Personal life==
Ross and her husband, Steve Wrinn, live in a home that they restored in Boylan Heights, a historic neighborhood in Raleigh.

Ross is one of three Unitarian Universalists in Congress.

<text>J. Sam Ellis (born April 30, 1955) is a Republican former member of the North Carolina General Assembly who represented the state&#x27;s thirty-ninth House district, including constituents in Wake County. An electrical contractor from Raleigh, Ellis was defeated by Democrat Linda Coleman in the 2004 general election.

In 2002, incoming freshmen at the University of North Carolina were required to read &quot;Approaching the Qur’an: The Early Revelations&quot; by Michael Sells, a scholar of comparative religions at Haverford College. When they arrived on campus, they were to briefly discuss the book in small groups led by a member of the faculty. Ellis backed a campaign to remove the use of state funds from the book, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t want the students in the university system required to study this evil.&quot;

<doc id="451561" wikidata="Q7153756" url="?curid=451561" title="Paul Stam">
<text>Paul B. &quot;Skip&quot; Stam Jr. (born September 5, 1950) was a Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state&#x27;s 37th House district, including constituents in Wake County. An attorney from Apex, North Carolina, Stam was elected to his seventh (non-consecutive) term in the state House of Representatives in 2012. He was first elected in 1988, but was defeated for re-election in 1990. He ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate and for the North Carolina Court of Appeals (in 1998 and 2000) before being elected to the House again in 2002.

==Tenure==
Stam won re-election from the 37th district in the 2004 election, defeating Libertarian H. Wade Minter in the November general election. In 2006, Stam was unsuccessfully challenged by Ed Ridpath (vote count: Stam 15,459 votes, Ridpath 11,628).

In December 2006, Stam and Rep. Fred Steen ran for House Republican Leader after Joe Kiser stepped down from the position. Stam was elected by his fellow House Republicans to the post. After Republicans won a majority in the state House in the 2010 elections, Stam lost a vote to become the party&#x27;s nominee for Speaker of the House to Representative Thom Tillis, but was elected Majority Leader instead. Following the 2012 elections, Stam was elected Speaker Pro Tempore, taking office in Jan. 2013.

At the close of the 2015 legislative session, Stam announced his intent to retire at the conclusion of the 2016 legislative session. The American Conservative Union gave him a lifetime legislative score of 93%.

===Controversies===
In February 2013, Stam drew criticism from news media when he maneuvered the House Rules Committee into giving an &quot;unfavorable report&quot; on a bill to stop arresting medical patients who use marijuana, prohibiting consideration of any similar measure for two years. After spending a total of 20 minutes on the bill, Stam accused constituents of harassing him and other legislators by sending them emails and phone calls encouraging them to vote for the bill. The nonprofit Marijuana Policy Project replied, &quot;Despite what Rep. Stam said, elected officials need to hear from their constituents.&quot;

In June 2014, in the course of a debate over a proposal to prohibit charter schools from discriminating in hiring or admissions on the grounds of &quot;sexual orientation or gender identity,&quot; Stam passed out a handout describing pedophilia, necrophilia and bestiality as &quot;sexual orientations&quot; (the language was taken from an obsolete edition of the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;). &quot;Many, many sexual orientations are not ones you want to have teaching kids in school. You may think you know what you mean by this, but you don&#x27;t,&quot; Stam said. He refused to further explain the list, which he had previously passed around when arguing against including sexual orientation in the state&#x27;s statute against school bullying in 2010. Speaker Tillis&#x27; office later issued a statement characterizing Stam&#x27;s remarks as &quot;not helpful&quot;.

In March, 2016 Stam co-sponsored Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act, commonly known as House Bill 2.

<doc id="451566" wikidata="Q833940" url="?curid=451566" title="Cobia">
<text>The cobia (Rachycentron canadum) (, ) is a species of marine carangiform ray-finned fish, the only extant representative of the genus &quot;Rachycentron&quot; and the family Rachycentridae. Its other common names include black kingfish, black salmon, ling, lemonfish, crabeater, prodigal son, codfish, and black bonito.

==Description==
Attaining a maximum length of 2 m (78 in) and maximum weight of , the cobia has an elongated, fusiform (spindle-shaped) body and a broad, flattened head. The eyes are small and the lower jaw projects slightly past the upper. Fibrous villiform teeth line the jaws, the tongue, and the roof of the mouth. The body of the fish is smooth with small scales. It is dark brown in color, grading to white on the belly with two darker brown horizontal bands on the flanks. The stripes are more prominent during spawning, when they darken and the background color flashes.

The large pectoral fins are normally carried horizontally, perhaps helping the fish attain the profile of a shark. The first dorsal fin has six to nine independent, short, stout, sharp spines. The family name Rachycentridae, from the Greek words &quot;rhachis&quot; (&quot;spine&quot;) and &quot;kentron&quot; (&quot;sting&quot;), was inspired by these dorsal spines. The mature cobia has a forked, slightly lunated tail, which is usually dark brown. The fish lacks a swim bladder. The juvenile cobia is patterned with conspicuous bands of black and white and has a rounded tail. The previous largest cobia taken on rod and reel came from Shark Bay, Australia, and weighed 60 kg (135 lb). The new record for cobia certified by the IGFA weighed and was caught near Rottnest Island, Australia.

==Similar species==
The cobia resembles its close relatives, the remoras of the family Echeneidae. It lacks the remora&#x27;s dorsal sucker and has a stouter body.

==Distribution and habitat==
The cobia is normally solitary except for annual spawning aggregations, and it sometimes congregates at reefs, wrecks, harbours, buoys, and other structural oases. It is pelagic, but it may enter estuaries and mangroves in search of prey.

It is found in warm-temperate to tropical waters of the West and East Atlantic Ocean, throughout the Caribbean, and in the Indian Ocean off the coast of India, Australia, and the Pacific coast of Japan. The cobia has been reported in various locations of the eastern Mediterranean Sea since 1978, following either entry via the Suez Canal or escape from mariculture.

It is eurythermal, tolerating a wide range of temperatures, from 1.6 to 32.2 °C. It is also euryhaline, living at salinities of 5.0 to 44.5 ppt.

==Ecology==
The cobia feeds primarily on crabs, squid, and fish. Like it&#x27;s relatives the remoras, it follows larger animals such as sharks, turtles, and manta rays to scavenge. It is a very curious fish, showing little fear of boats.

The predators of the cobia are not well documented, but the mahi-mahi (&quot;Coryphaena hippurus&quot;) is known to feed on juveniles and the shortfin mako shark (&quot;Isurus oxyrinchus&quot;) eats the adults.

The cobia is frequently parasitized by nematodes, trematodes, cestodes, copepods, and acanthocephalans.

==Life history==
The cobia is a pelagic spawner, releasing many tiny (1.2 mm), buoyant eggs into the water, where they become part of the plankton. The eggs float freely with the currents until hatching. The larvae are also planktonic, being more or less helpless during their first week until the eyes and mouths develop. The male matures at two years and the female at three years. Both sexes lead moderately long lives of 15 years or more. Breeding activity takes place diurnally from April to September in large, offshore congregations, where the female is capable of spawning up to 30 times during the season.

==Migration==
The cobia makes seasonal migrations. It winters in the Gulf of Mexico, then moves north as far as Massachusetts for the summer, passing Florida around March.

==Culinary use==
The cobia is sold commercially and commands a relatively high price for its firm texture and excellent flavor, but no designated wild fishery exists because it is a solitary species. It has been farmed in aquaculture. The flesh is usually sold fresh. It is typically served in the form of grilled or poached fillets. Chefs Jamie Oliver and Mario Batali each cooked several dishes made with cobia in the &quot;Battle Cobia&quot; episode of the Food Network program &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;, which first aired in January, 2008. Thomas Keller&#x27;s restaurant, The French Laundry, has offered cobia on its tasting menu.

==Aquaculture==

This fish is considered to be one of the most suitable candidates for warm, open-water marine fish aquaculture in the world. Its rapid growth rate and the high quality of the flesh could make it one of the most important marine fish for future aquaculture production.

Currently, the cobia is being cultured in nurseries and offshore grow-out cages in parts of Asia, the United States, Mexico, and Panama. In Taiwan, cobia of 100 to 600 g are cultured for 1.0 to 1.5 years until they reach 6 to 8 kg. They are then exported to Japan, China, North America, and Europe. Around 80% of marine cages in Taiwan are devoted to cobia culture. In 2004, the FAO reported that 80.6% of the world&#x27;s cobia production was in China and Taiwan. Vietnam is the third-largest producer, yielding 1,500 tonnes in 2008. Following the success of cobia aquaculture in Taiwan, emerging technology is being used to demonstrate the viability of hatchery-reared cobia in collaboration with the private sector at exposed offshore sites in Puerto Rico and the Bahamas, and the largest open ocean farm in the world is run by a company called Open Blue off the coast of Panama.

Greater depths, stronger currents, and distance from shore all act to reduce environmental impacts often associated with finfish aquaculture. Offshore cage systems could become a more environmentally sustainable method for commercial marine fish aquaculture. However, some problems still exist in cobia culture, including high mortality due to stress during transfer from nursery tanks or inshore cages to the offshore grow-out cages, as well as disease.

==Diseases==
The cobia are susceptible to multiple parasitic and bacterial infections such as &quot;Amyloodinium&quot; species, &quot;Photobacterium damselae&quot; subsp.&quot; piscicida&quot; and &quot;Lactococcus garvieae&quot;.

He graduated from the University of St. Petersburg (1916). In 1917 he was one of the founders of the Union of Georgian Writers. In 1917–1919 he was a member of the &quot;National Council of Georgia&quot;. On May 26, 1918 Ingorokva signed the &quot;Act of Independence of Georgia&quot;. In 1921 he protested the occupation of Georgia by the Bolshevist Russia, in 1921–1923 Ingorokva was a member of the group &quot;Shavchokhianebi&quot; (&quot;Blackchokhians&quot;). In 1924–1925, he was the editor-in-chief of the Georgian scientific and literary Journal Kavkasioni (&quot;The Caucasus&quot;). The Journal was closed by the Bolshevik regime.

In 1925 Ingorokva founded the Publishing House &quot;Kartuli Tsigni&quot; (&quot;The Georgian Book&quot;). This Publishing House published works of Ilia Chavchavadze in the XI volumes (1926–1928) and works of other outstanding Georgian authors. In 1933 &quot;Kartuli Tsigni&quot; was closed.

In 1929–1940 Ingorokva was a Head of the Department of Manuscripts of the State Museum of Georgia (now the Georgian National Museum), in 1940–1950 a senior research fellow of the Institute of History (Tbilisi). In 1958 he was one of the founders of the Institute of Manuscripts (now the Georgian National Center of Manuscripts). He was also a member of the Commission on Study of &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot; of the Georgian Academy of Sciences (GAS) (now Georgian National Academy of Sciences).

Pavle Ingorokva&#x27;s main fields of the scientific activity were the history of the Georgian literature, history of Georgia, source studies of the history of Georgia, Rustavelology (Study of the works of the mediaeval Georgian writer Shota Rustaveli), history of Georgian script, etc. Some of his findings have proved extremely contentious.

<text>The National Solar Observatory (NSO) is a United States federally funded research and development center to advance the knowledge of the physics of the Sun. NSO studies the Sun both as an astronomical object and as the dominant external influence on Earth.
NSO is headquartered in Boulder and operates facilities at a number of locations – at the 4-meter Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope in the Haleakala Observatory on the island of Maui, at Sacramento Peak near Sunspot in New Mexico, and six sites around the world for the Global Oscillations Network Group one of which is shared with the Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun.

NSO provides its observations to the scientific community. It operates facilities, develops advanced instrumentation both in-house and through partnerships, conducts solar research, and carries out educational and public outreach.

== Visiting the observatories ==
The National Solar Observatory HQ is located on the campus of the University of Colorado, Boulder. It also has some staff on Maui, and Sacramento Peak.

== Telescopes operated by the observatory ==
=== Big Bear Solar Observatory ===
* Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun

=== Haleakala Observatory ===
* Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope

=== Sacramento Peak ===
* See Sunspot Solar Observatory for the telescopes located there

=== Global ===
* Global Oscillation Network Group

== Directors ==

A list of all NSO directors since the founding of the observatory is given below.
==History==
The Sacramento Peak observatories were proposed by Donald Menzel of the Harvard College Observatory in 1947, when the U.S. Air Force commissioned a site survey for a suitable facility that would study the higher regions of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The site, near White Sands Proving Ground, was chosen in 1948. The first equipment to be operated by the Harvard Observatory was installed in 1949, a prominence camera, and a flare patrol camera, installed in the Grain Bin Dome.

These instruments were followed by the Evans Solar Facility, or Big Dome, which housed a coronograph and spectrograph. In 1963 the Hilltop Dome was built to house additional instruments.

The Sacramento Peak facilities are located in Sunspot, New Mexico. The site&#x27;s name was chosen by the late James C. Sadler, (1920–2005), an internationally noted meteorologist and professor at The University of Hawaii, formerly with the United States Air Force on assignment during the early inception of the observatory.

For the Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, NSO enlisted the cooperation of various groups in the Citizen CATE (Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse) experiment to set up more than 60 identical telescopes along the eclipse path, to produce 90 continuous minutes of images, 10 seconds apart, of the Sun&#x27;s inner corona. This was to provide a clearer understanding of solar plumes and other transient phenomena.

<text>Richard Timothy Morgan (July 12, 1952 – October 10, 2018) was a Republican member of the North Carolina House of Representatives representing the state&#x27;s thirty-first and later fifty-second districts, including constituents in Moore County, for eight terms.

==Biography==
Morgan was born in Southern Pines, North Carolina. He graduated from Pinecrest High School and received his associate in arts degree from Sandhills Community College. In 1974, Morgan received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Morgan was an insurance broker and cattle farmer from Pinehurst, North Carolina. 
Morgan died on October 10, 2018, at the age of 66, at Duke University Medical Center, in Durham, North Carolina.

==Political career==
Richard Morgan first ran as a Republican for the General Assembly in 1976 and 1980 and lost. Morgan next ran as a Republican for state insurance commissioner in 1984 and lost. Morgan was elected as a Republican to the North Carolina House of Representatives, representing Moore County, in 1990, and was re-elected from 1992 through 2004.

In the 2002 elections, Republican won a 61- to 59-seat majority in the North Carolina House of Representatives, and the Republican caucus nominated Rep. Leo Daughtry to be Speaker of the state House. Richard Morgan, a member of the Republican caucus, announced he would oppose Daughtry and run for Speaker of the House himself. After another Republican, Rep. Michael Decker later switched to the Democratic Party, creating a 60–60 tie. Morgan then led a Republican faction that agreed to form a coalition with the Democrats. The coalition elected two &quot;co-speakers&quot; of the House for the first time in state history, for the North Carolina General Assembly of 2003-2004. Speaker Jim Black, a Democrat, was called the &quot;Democratic Speaker,&quot; and Morgan was called the &quot;Republican Speaker.&quot; A number of Republicans—but less than a majority of the Republican caucus—considered Morgan&#x27;s actions tantamount to betraying his party.

Rep. Morgan was removed from the North Carolina Republican Party&#x27;s executive committee in May 2004 for &quot;party disloyalty.&quot; In the 2006 election he was defeated by a Republican opponent in the primary.

In 2008, Morgan ran for North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction, losing to June Atkinson. In 2010, he ran for the State Senate but lost in the Republican primary to incumbent Harris Blake.

<doc id="451578" wikidata="Q6240617" url="?curid=451578" title="John I. Sauls">
<text>John Irwin Sauls II (born November 29, 1949) is a Republican member of the North Carolina House of Representatives. A pastor from Sanford, North Carolina and former Lee County Commissioner, he has represented the 51st district (including constituents in Lee and Harnett counties) since 2017. When Sauls returned to the NC House in 2017, he held the position of Republican Freshman Chair. He has been elected to the NC House a total of 5 times, most recently in 2022.

==Personal life==
Sauls&#x27; son, John Sauls III or &quot;Pastor J3&quot; took over Sauls position as lead pastor at Crossroads Ministries in 2016. Sauls is a Vietnam-era veteran.

==Political career==
Sauls claimed he was ready to run for commissioner when he was approached by Lee County GOP in 1997 because “God had prepared [him] for it.” Sauls won by a close margin to join the NC House in both 2002 and 2004. In 2016, Sauls ran for House District 51 yet again, and flipped the district when he beat Democratic incumbent Brad Salmon.

==Political positions==
===Education===
Sauls voted for the 2017 Republican budget and voted to override the governor’s veto. Starting teacher pay remains at $35,000 under the Republican budget. Many educators, including veterans of 25 years, will only see an increase of $30 a month, merely a tank of gas. Sauls voted “yes” to H13, which capped K-3 class sizes at 22 to 24 students, without providing adequate funding to support the bill. The mandate for smaller class sizes will cost North Carolina school districts as much as $388 million more per year.

=== Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act ===

Though he was not in office for the passage of House Bill 2, Sauls did say he supported the &quot;bathroom part.&quot; His only criticism of the bill was the manner in which it was passed. Sauls voted to pass House Bill 142, also known as the “HB2 Compromise,” despite pushback from conservative groups that have endorsed him in the past.

===Alcohol consumption and gambling===
Sauls voted “no” on H500, an alcoholic beverage control omnibus bill that would ease regulations on North Carolina’s numerous micro-breweries. Three weeks after it was introduced House Bill 500 was gutted despite support from the state’s more than 200 craft brewers. Sauls voted against S155, the “Brunch Bill,” which allows vendors to sell alcoholic beverages before 10 a.m. on Sunday. Sauls said he couldn’t support the bill “personally.” As a pastor, Sauls doesn&#x27;t condemn alcohol drinkers but has &quot;preached too many funerals that were alcohol related.&quot; John Sauls “had several motor vehicle accidents when…[he] was drinking.” Sauls opposed establishing a state-run education lottery and compared using a lottery to fund education to a “drug dealer who keep selling drugs instead of taking a job.”

===Reproductive rights===
Sauls voted for the 2017 Republican budget which allocated money to crisis pregnancy centers, clinics that “discourage women from getting abortions would receive a big boost in state financial support.” Sauls voted to table a budget amendment that would redirect money from the Carolina Pregnancy Care Fellowship to the Department of Health and Human Services.

===Environment===
Sauls voted for H56, a bill that repealed the Outer Banks plastic bag ban and was called the “junk drawer of environmental laws.” Republican legislators tied funding to monitor GenX in the Cape Fear River to a repeal of the coastal ban on plastic bags. The bill directs $185K to the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority and $250K to the UNCW to monitor and study GenX despite Gov. Cooper asked for $2.6 million in funding. H56 repealed the plastic bag ban in the Outer Banks that had been in effect since 2009 to protect animals like sea turtles. Sauls voted for S131, which deregulated policies that were meant to protect stream beds, beaches and air quality. Sauls voted for H576, which would have allowed the spraying of &quot;garbage juice&quot; without a permit. H576 would allow landfill operators to “dispose” of landfill fluids by “spraying it into the air over their property” without a permit. Communities where over half the residents are people of color are 2.8 more likely to be near a solid waste facility, according to research published in Environmental Health Perspectives. Sauls voted for S16, a business regulatory reform bill that “imposes limitations on local governments’ power over landfill permits.” Senate Bill 16 is a “16-page grab bag of deregulation provisions. It loosens water quality rules and imposes limitations on local governments power over landfill permits, changes that the Democratic governor called dangerous in his veto message.”

===Voter ID===
In a statement to the Sanford Herald, Sauls said he has “never understood the opposition” to voter ID requirements. Sauls said he doesn’t “see how a statewide election law can target African-Americans.”

<text>Joe Hackney (born September 23, 1945, in Chatham County, North Carolina) served for 16 terms (32 years) as a Democratic member of the North Carolina House of Representatives from the state&#x27;s fifty-fourth House district, including constituents in Chatham, Orange, and Moore counties. A farmer and attorney from Chapel Hill, Hackney served as Speaker of the House for two terms and thereafter served as House Minority Leader until he chose to retire rather than seek another term in the legislature in 2012.

==Early life==
Hackney was born on September 23, 1945, in Chatham County, North Carolina. He grew up on small dairy farm near Silk Hope in Chatham County, where he was the youngest of five children.

Hackney attended North Carolina State University before transferring to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he earned bachelor&#x27;s and Juris Doctor degrees. He worked as a prosecutor from 1971 to 1974 before going into private practice. In 1974, he was campaign manager for Congressman Ike Andrews. While an undergraduate at UNC-Chapel Hill, he wrote his Honors Thesis on the history of the North Carolina corrections system.

==Family==
He is married to Betsy Strandberg of Rocky Mount, North Carolina; they have two grown children, Dan and Will. Dan lives in Charlottesville, Va., and is employed at Sperry Marine as a software engineer. Will is a musician and a principal in Chapel Hill-Carrboro based Trekky Records, an independent record label.

Hackney is the great great grandson of Daniel Hackney, who represented Chatham County in the North Carolina House of Commons in the 1840s and 1850s.

==Career==
Hackney has been a partner in the Chapel Hill law firm of Epting &amp; Hackney since 1974, currently emphasizing civil litigation and domestic relations.

In addition to practicing law, Hackney operates the family beef cattle farm in Chatham County with his brother, Jack Hackney.

==Legislative highlights==
He served two terms (four years) as Speaker pro tempore of the state House, and two terms as House Majority Leader (or &quot;Democratic leader&quot;, when no party had a majority in 2003–2004). On January 10, 2007, Hackney was nominated by the Democratic majority as Speaker of the House. He was elected speaker when the new legislature convened on January 24, with all 68 House Democrats supporting him. Hackney was reelected speaker for a second two-year term in January 2009. He was embroiled in a controversy during his tenure as Speaker when, on July 9, 2010, he relieved pastor Ron Baity of his duties as honorary chaplain of the House over the content of a prayer.

After Democrats lost their House majority in the 2010 elections, Hackney was elected to continue leading his party as Minority Leader. He also became co-chairman of the House Ethics Committee in the 2011–12 session and was the only House Democrat given a committee chairmanship by Speaker Thom Tillis.

Hackney served as President of the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) for a one-year term starting in July 2008. In that role he led an organization made up of all state legislators and staff. NCSL advocates on behalf of states before Congress and the federal administration and provides professional development opportunities for legislative staff. In 2007, the National Conference of State Legislatures awarded Hackney its Excellence in State Legislative Leadership Award.

In February 2012, Hackney announced his intention to retire as House Minority Leader after his term ended.

Hackney has been consistently rated in the top ten for effectiveness (out of 120) by peers in the North Carolina Center for Public Policy Research survey, when the House is in Democratic control. He rated 5th in 1992 survey; 4th in 1994 survey; 4th in 1999 survey; 5th in 2001 survey; 4th in 2003 survey; 3rd in 2005 survey; and 1st in 2007 survey.

He has sponsored many pieces of significant legislation, including the phosphate detergent ban; the Waste Management Act of 1989, which established an aggressive policy on reducing solid waste in North Carolina; the .08 DWI bill, lowering the permissible level of blood alcohol content for drivers; the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, giving additional protections to taxpayers dealing with the N.C. Department of Revenue; domestic relations reform measures, including bills to streamline procedures for equitable distribution, alimony and divorce; in 1995, a new rewrite of alimony laws and DWI laws; in 1997, Governor&#x27;s DWI reform bill, including vehicle seizure and forfeiture provisions, and three equitable distribution reform bills; in 1999, clean air, clean water, and sedimentation bills, HMO liability, and DWI improvements.

<doc id="451582" wikidata="Q7873623" url="?curid=451582" title="USS S-28">
<text>USS &quot;S-28&quot; (SS-133) was an &quot;S&quot;-class submarine of the United States Navy. A diesel submarine, she served in World War II during which sank one Japanese ship. She was lost at sea with all hands in July 1944. Her wreck was discovered in 2017 at a depth of off the coast of Oahu.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;S-28&quot;′s keel was laid down on 16 April 1919 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. She was launched on 20 September 1922, sponsored by Mrs. William R. Monroe, and commissioned on 13 December 1923.

==Service history==
===Inter-war period===
Following shakedown exercises off the southern New England coast, &quot;S-28&quot; moved south in March 1924 to join Submarine Division 11 in the final exercises of 1924&#x27;s winter maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea. In April 1924 she returned to New London, Connecticut, with her division and commenced local exercises which occupied the remainder of 1924. In the winter of 1925, she moved south again, transited the Panama Canal, and, after the conclusion of Fleet Problem V, conducted in the vicinity of Guadalupe Island, she arrived in the Hawaiian Islands for a month&#x27;s stay. In June 1924, she moved to San Diego, California, where her division replaced another division which had transferred to the United States Asiatic Fleet.

&quot;S-28&quot; operated primarily off Southern California until 1931, calling at Mare Island Navy Yard in California for regularly scheduled overhaul periods and also deploying for a Fleet Problem in the Panama Canal area in 1926, for summer maneuvers near Hawaii in 1927, for a Fleet Problem in the Panama Canal area in 1929, and for summer maneuvers near Hawaii in 1930.

&quot;S=28&quot; departed the United States West Coast for Hawaii in mid-February 1931, and on 23 February 1931 arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, from which she operated for the next years. In mid-1939, she transferred back to San Diego, where she took part in training activities for the Underwater Sound Training School.

===World War II===
On 7 December 1941, &quot;S-28&quot; – then a unit of Submarine Division 41 – was undergoing overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard when the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II. On 22 January 1942, the work was completed, and she returned to San Diego, where she resumed her training activities for the Underwater Sound Training School. She continued that duty into the spring of 1942, then was ordered north to the Aleutian Islands to augment U.S. defenses in the Territory of Alaska.

On 20 May 1942, &quot;S-28&quot;, with other submarines of her division, departed San Diego. They stopped at Port Angeles, Washington on 25 May 1942, then continued on toward the newly established submarine base at Dutch Harbor, on Amaknak Island off Unalaska in the Aleutian Islands. On 29 May 1942, however, as the United States made preparations to minimize a two-pronged Japanese thrust against Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and the Aleutians, the S-boats received orders to proceed to their patrol areas, bypassing Dutch Harbor.

====First war patrol====
During a quickly extinguished fire in her port main motor on the morning of 1 June 1942, &quot;S-28&quot; suffered minor damage. That evening, she parted company with her sister ships and their escort, and on 2 June 1942 she entered her assigned patrol area and commenced patrolling the approaches to Cold Bay on the tip of the Alaskan Peninsula. On 3 June 1942, the Japanese bombed Dutch Harbor, opening the Aleutian Islands campaign, and, within the week, they had occupied Kiska and Attu in the Aleutians. On 11 June 1942, a U.S. Navy floatplane mistook her for a Japanese submarine and attacked her in the Pacific Ocean south of the Aleutians at , dropping a bomb or depth charge as she crash-dived that inflicted only slight damage and no casualties. On 12 June 1942, &quot;S-28&quot; arrived at Dutch Harbor, refueled, took on provisions, and headed west to resume her war patrol.

On 15 June 1942, &quot;S-28&quot; crossed the International Date Line, and on 17 June – after a two-day storm – she sighted Kiska and set a course to intercept Japanese shipping between there and Attu. On 18 June 1942, she fired on her first enemy target – an Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer – and the destroyer in turn counterattacked her. Eight hours later, sounds of the destroyer&#x27;s search faded out to the south. &quot;S-28&quot; had survived her first encounter with Japanese antisubmarine warfare forces.

Poor weather soon returned, and storms raged during 80% of &quot;S-28&quot;′s remaining time on station. On 28 June 1942, she moored in Dutch Harbor and commenced a refit.

====Second war patrol====
On 15 July 1942, &quot;S-28&quot; got underway for her second war patrol and again headed for the Kiska area. On 18 July 1942, she reconnoitered Semisopochnoi, then moved on to Segula. Finding no signs of Japanese activity, she continued westward. On 20 July 1942 she was ordered to take station on an circle from Sirius Point prior to sunrise on 22 July 1942, at which time a U.S. Navy task force was to bombard Japanese facilities on Kiska. The bombardment was delayed, delayed, and &quot;S-28&quot; remained on that more distant station until 30 July 1942, when she was ordered back into the Kiska area. On 18 August 1942, having been unable to close any of the targets sighted during the latter part of her patrol, she returned to Dutch Harbor.

====Third war patrol====
On her third war patrol, which she conducted from 16 September to 10 October 1942, &quot;S-28&quot; returned to the Kiska area. She operated to the north of the island until 25 October 1942, then, with the discovery of the Japanese development of Gertrude Cove on Vega Bay on the coast of Kiska, she shifted to the island&#x27;s southern shore. On the night of 6–7 October 1942, she turned toward Unalaska, and on the morning of 10 October 1942, as she prepared to fire on an unidentified vessel, a ground in her fire control circuits caused an accidental firing of a torpedo from the No. 1 torpedo tube. That afternoon, she arrived at Dutch Harbor.

====October–December 1942====
From Dutch Harbor, &quot;S-28&quot; headed to San Diego, which she reached on 23 October 1942. She provided training services for the West Coast Sound School and for the Amphibious Forces Training Group from 26 October to 13 November 1942. Then, during an overhaul, she received a fathometer, a Kleinschmidt distilling unit, and SJ radar. On 9 December 1942, she again headed north. On 16 December 1942, she reported by radio to Task Group 8.5 (TG 8.5), and on 21 December 1942 she arrived at Dutch Harbor.

====Fourth war patrol====
On 27 December 1942, &quot;S-28&quot; departed Dutch Harbor on her fourth war patrol. On 3 January 1943, she crossed the International Date Line, and on 5 January 1943 she entered her assigned area in the northern Kuril Islands. Moving down the coast of Paramushiro, she patrolled in Onekotan Strait, then headed north again, and on 20 January 1943 passed Shumushu, from which she set a course for the Aleutians and returned to Dutch Harbor.

====Fifth war patrol====
During her fifth war patrol, which she conducted from 6 to 28 February 1943, &quot;S-28&quot; remained in the western Aleutians, patrolling across the Attu-Buldir-Sirius Point route and along the coast of Attu, particularly off Holtz Bay, Chichagof Harbor, and Sarana Bay. Poor weather and her lack of speed, however, impeded her hunting.

====March–June 1943====
On her return to Dutch Harbor, &quot;S-28&quot; was ordered south, and on 4 March 1943 she got underway for Esquimalt, British Columbia, Canada, where from 15 March to 15 April 1943 she conducted sound tests and antisubmarine warfare exercises with Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Canadian Air Force units. She then continued on to the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, Washington, for overhaul and superstructure modification work. On 27 June 1943, she started back to Alaska.

====Sixth war patrol====
On 13 July 1943, &quot;S-28&quot; departed Dutch Harbor to return to the northern Kuril Islands for her sixth war patrol. Again, she patrolled off Paramushiro and in the straits to its north and south. Again, she was hindered by the weather, her obsolete design, and by mechanical failures. On 14 August 1943, she headed for the Aleutians, and on 16 August 1943 she moored in Massacre Bay on the coast of Attu — retaken from the Japanese in the Battle of Attu in May 1943 — and commenced a refit.

====Seventh war patrol====
The late arrival of needed spares from Dutch Harbor delayed her readiness for sea, but on 8 September 1943, &quot;S-28&quot; departed Attu to return to the northern Kuril Islands for her seventh and final war patrol. On 13 September 1943, she entered her patrol area. On 15 September 1943, severe smoking and sparking from her port main motor necessitated 14 hours of repair work. On 16 September 1943, she transited Mushiru Kaikyo, and, on the afternoon of 19 September 1943, she closed on an what she identified as an unescorted freighter off the island of Araito. Her torpedoes missed their mark. The supposed freighter was a warship, which turned and within minutes had delivered the first two depth charges of a 10-minute attack. The Japanese ship searched the area for an hour, then departed.

&quot;S-28&quot; continued her patrol. At 19:16 on 19 September 1943, she contacted a second unescorted Japanese vessel. At 19:43, she fired a spread of four torpedoes. At 19:44, two of the four exploded. The target took on a 30° list and began to sink by the bow. At 19:46, the converted gunboat sank, bow first, her stern vertical in the air. Five loud underwater explosions followed her disappearance. &quot;S-28&quot; went deep and rigged for a depth charging which did not materialize.

Into October 1943, &quot;S-28&quot; hunted just north of Araito and off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula. On 5 October 1943, she moved through Onekotan Strait and continued her patrol on the Pacific side of the Kuril Islands. On 10 October 1943, however, a crewman developed severe appendicitis, and she headed for Attu one day ahead of schedule. On 13 October 1943, she moored at Attu. The next day, she departed for Dutch Harbor.

====November 1943–July 1944====
In November 1943, &quot;S-28&quot; headed south to Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor in mid-November 1943, and – after overhaul – commenced training duty. For the next seven months, she remained in Hawaiian waters, providing training services.

====Loss====
On 3 July 1944, &quot;S-28&quot; began anti-submarine warfare training operations off Oahu with the United States Coast Guard cutter . The anti-submarine warfare exercises continued into the evening of 4 July 1944. At 17:30, the day&#x27;s concluding exercise began. Contact between the two vessels became sporadic and, at 18:20, &quot;Reliance&quot; made and lost her last, brief contact with &quot;S-28&quot;. All of &quot;Reliance&quot;′s further attempts to establish communications with &quot;S-28&quot; failed.

Assistance arrived from Pearl Harbor, but a thorough search of the area failed to locate &quot;S-28&quot; or her crew. Two days later, a slick of diesel fuel appeared in the area where she had been operating, but the extreme depth of the waters there exceeded the range of available rescue and salvage equipment. A court of inquiry was unable to determine the cause of the loss of &quot;S-28&quot;.

==Discovery of wreck==
On 20 September 2017, Tim Taylor, with the support of STEP Ventures. discovered the wreck of &quot;S-28&quot; at a depth of off the coast of Oahu.

The wreck lies in 2 major pieces near each other on the ocean floor. The main portion of the midship and stern lies on its starboard side with visible implosion damage while the detached bow lies upside down.

Additionally, Lewis formerly served as the National Committeeman for the North Carolina Republican Party.

In August 2020, he pleaded guilty to making a false statement to a bank.

==Early life, education and career==
Lewis was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, the son of Jean (née Hudson) and Donnie Lewis. He grew up in Dunn area and attended Cape Fear High School in Cumberland County, North Carolina.

He is a tobacco farmer and co-owner at Quality Equipment, LLC.

==Political career==
===Gerrymandering===
Lewis was the co-chair of the elections committee, responsible for the voter identification legislation as well as his work on the most recent round of redistricting in the State of North Carolina. This redistricting has been challenged as
an instance of partisan gerrymandering.
In his role as NC House redistricting leader, Lewis said that he wanted the maps drawn “to give a partisan advantage to 10 Republicans and three Democrats because [he did] not believe it’s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.”
 In addition, he stated: “I think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats. So I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country.”

===Vote Rigging===
During a fraud investigation into the 2018 U.S. House race in North Carolina&#x27;s 9th district where a Republican operative conducted large-scale electoral fraud, Lewis introduced a bill that would put Republicans in charge of every election board in every election year. On July 24, 2020, Lewis announced that he would be retiring at the end of his term and would not seek re-election.

===Resignation===
Lewis resigned on August 20, 2020, when he was charged with making false statements to a bank and failure to file a tax return.

* Corruption indictment
On August 26, 2020, Lewis pleaded guilty to making a false statement to a bank and failing to file his federal income tax return. Federal investigators produced evidence that Lewis had stolen funds from his campaign account in order to prop up his failing farm. Specifically, Lewis opened a new bank account with the name &quot;NC GOP Inc&quot; and then wrote checks totaling $65,000 to that new account from his campaign account. This was evidently an attempt to make it appear as if the money was being transferred to the North Carolina Republican Party. Although he faced sentencing guidelines of up to 30 years in prison, prosecutors allowed Lewis to take a plea deal. He was let off with no prison time.

On August 17, 2021 he was sentenced for misappropriating campaign funds and failing to file his 2018 federal income tax return. Lewis was sentenced to 24 months supervised release in which one year was for the false return count, and is to serve one day active sentence for each count served concurrent.

<doc id="451590" wikidata="Q4733597" url="?curid=451590" title="Alma Adams">
<text>Alma Shealey Adams (born May 27, 1946) is an American politician who represents North Carolina&#x27;s 12th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. A Democrat, Adams represented the state&#x27;s 58th House district in Guilford County in the North Carolina General Assembly from her appointment in April 1994 until her election to Congress, succeeded by Ralph C. Johnson.

Adams is a former college administrator and art professor from Greensboro. She is known for her distinctive hats. She won the 2014 special election in North Carolina&#x27;s 12th congressional district to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Mel Watt, becoming the 100th woman serving in the 113th Congress. She won election to a full two-year term at the same time.

==Early life and education==
Adams was born on May 27, 1946, in High Point, North Carolina, to Benjamin Shealey and Mattie Stokes. She was raised by her mother, who worked as a domestic worker. Adams moved with her family to Baltimore, Maryland, as a child before settling in Newark, New Jersey. She attended the predominantly white West Side High School in Newark and graduated in 1964. 

Adams then went to North Carolina A&amp;T State University in Greensboro, North Carolina, where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1969 and a Master of Science degree in 1972, both in art education. While at NC A&amp;T, she served as president of the Arts Circle and became a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.

== Art career ==

After completing her graduate studies, Adams was appointed chair of the art department at the Palmer Institute, where she taught students in grades seven through twelve. She later earned a Ph.D. in art education and multicultural education from Ohio State University in 1981. 

Adams later joined the faculty of Bennett College in Greensboro, where she taught until 2012. She was also the director of the Steel Hall Art Gallery. In 1990, Adams and artist Eva Hamlin Miller co-founded the African American Atelier, an organization established to advance awareness and appreciation for visual arts and cultures of African Americans.

==State legislature==
Adams began her political career as a member of the Greensboro City School Board from 1984 to 1986, before serving on the Greensboro City Council from 1987 until her appointment to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1994.

She was appointed to the state House to fill the seat of Representative Herman Gist, who had died in office. At the time of her appointment, Adams had already announced her candidacy to challenge Gist in the upcoming Democratic primary in 1994. The house district included most of southeastern Greensboro in Guilford County. In the primary election, she defeated O.C. Stafford, a businessman, retired engineer, and perennial candidate, who had previously run for office as both a Democrat and a Republican. Adams won a full term in the 1994 general election, defeating Republican Roger G. Coffer. She went on to win reelection in 1996 and 1998 against Stafford, who ran as a Republican in both races. In 2000, Adams was unopposed in the Democratic primary and defeated Republican Jim Rumley in the general election.

Following redistricting in 2002, Adams&#x27; district was renumbered from the 26th to the 58th. That year, she was challenged by Libertarian candidate David Williams, who withdrew from the race before the election but remained on the ballot. Adams won reelection with nearly 86% of the vote. From 2004 onward, she faced repeated challenges from Republican legal assistant and party activist Olga Morgan Wright, defeating her in every election through 2012.

Adams defeated Wright and Libertarian challenger Walter Sperko with 66% of the vote in 2004. In the next election Adams had no competition in the primary; she defeated Wright in the general election 66%–34%. In 2008, the year Barack Obama was elected president, Democratic voters had a high rate of participation, and Adams defeated Wright 71.35%–28.65% In 2010, Adams was challenged in the Democratic primary by Ralph C. Johnson. She defeated Johnson with 76.56% of the vote. Adams next faced Republican Darin H. Thomas in the general election, beating him 63.15%–36.85%. In 2012, Adams had no primary opposition and defeated Olga Wright in the general election, 79.86%–20.14%.

During her tenure in the North Carolina House, Adams was elected chair of the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus and served a second term in that role in 2008. She also chaired the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus Foundation, which provides scholarships to students attending the state&#x27;s Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Adams held leadership roles in several committees, including serving as vice chair of the Government Committee, chair of the Appropriations Committee, and vice chair of the Commerce, Small Business, and Entrepreneurship Committee.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
====2014 special and general elections====

In April 2013, Mel Watt, the only congressman to have served the 12th District since its creation in 1993, was appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Adams was one of the first to announce that if Watt were confirmed, she would run in the ensuing special election. Watt was confirmed in December 2013. Adams formally filed paperwork to run in both the Democratic primary for a full two-year term in the 114th Congress and the special election held in November 2014 to fill the balance of Watt&#x27;s 11th term. Adams was sworn in on November 12, 2014, to complete the remaining seven weeks of Watt&#x27;s term. After the swearing-in, Adams became the 100th female member of the congressional class, beating the previous record of 99.
Analysts thought that Adams was at a geographic disadvantage in the five-way primary for both the special and regular elections (held on the same day in November 2014). She is from Greensboro, but the bulk of the district&#x27;s population is in Charlotte. But with three Charlotteans in the race splitting that region&#x27;s vote, Adams won both primaries with about 44% of the vote, a few thousand votes over the 40% threshold needed to avoid a runoff. She faced Republican Vince Coakley, a former television and radio broadcaster from Matthews, in the general and special elections, which were held on the same day. The 12th was a heavily Democratic district with a majority-black voting population and a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+26, and Adams won both elections handily.

Adams is the second woman of color to represent North Carolina in the House. The first was Eva Clayton, who represented much of eastern North Carolina from 1992 to 2002.

==== 2016 ====
A court-ordered redistricting in 2016 made the Adam&#x27;s 12th district somewhat more compact. It now comprised nearly all of Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte. Her home in Greensboro was drawn into the 13th district. She subsequently moved to Charlotte to remain in the 12th district. Whether she had moved by June was not clear.

With seven Charlotteans splitting the vote, Adams won the 2016 Democratic primary with 42%, just over the threshold to avoid a runoff. This all but assured her of a second full term; due to Charlotte and Mecklenburg County&#x27;s heavy swing to the Democrats in recent years, the reconfigured 12th is no less Democratic than its predecessor.

===Tenure===

Adams endorsed Hillary Clinton In the 2016 presidential election and pledged her support as a superdelegate. She did not attend the Inauguration of Donald Trump in 2017.

Adams and Representatives A. Donald McEachin and Brian Fitzpatrick introduced the African American Burial Grounds Preservation Act in 2022, would have the National Park Service work with local governments to identify, survey, research, and preserve historic African American cemeteries and burial grounds. The legislation has bipartisan support in the House.

Adams voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

<text>Cary Dale Allred (February 7, 1947 – December 10, 2011) was a member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state&#x27;s sixty-fourth House district, including constituents in Alamance County. A business owner from Burlington, North Carolina, Allred was elected to eight terms in the state House. He previously served two terms in the state Senate. Allred served in the United States Navy, and has also served as an Alamance County commissioner. He spent the majority of his career as a Republican, but following a series of public controversies, he left the Republican Party in 2010 and registered as an independent.

Allred died December 10, 2011, in Greensboro, North Carolina at the age of 64.

==Early life==
Cary Allred was born February 7, 1947, in Mebane, North Carolina, and graduated from Southern Alamance High School in 1965. He then went on to serve in the U.S. Navy and graduate from Elon University in 1970.

==Recent electoral history==
===2010===
In March 2010, Allred changed his voter registration to unaffiliated and stated his intention to run for County Commissioner in Alamance County either as an independent or a write-in candidate. He was able to get enough signatures to qualify as a write-in, but eventually lost the race to Republican Tom Manning.

==Controversies==
In 1981, while a state senator, Allred wrote letters on his company letterhead asking for opinions on health issues and to keep his company in mind for their needs. An investigation by the state Senate found this to be an ethics violation.

In August 2008, Allred caused a minor local controversy by handing out his legislative cards and state maps at a local Southern Alamance High School football game during his run for the North Carolina Legislature. He was asked to leave the premises.

In November 2008, after winning re-election, Allred left a series of answering machine messages bragging about his victory while sounding intoxicated. Allred claimed that he was &quot;intoxicated with victory&quot;.

On the evening of April 27, 2009, Allred was pulled over by a North Carolina State Highway Patrolman, who observed the representative traveling 102 MPH in a 65 MPH zone. Allred stated that he had consumed one chelada. Later that evening, he arrived at the state legislature and embraced a 17-year-old page. Both Allred and the page have stated that they share a &quot;Grandfather-granddaughter&quot; relationship; however, on April 30, 2009, an investigation was launched by the Sergeant-at-Arms of the legislature.

On May 20, 2009, a report indicated that several persons had seen Allred behave &quot;inappropriately&quot; with the page. Mr. Allred threatened to leave the Republican Party. He then resigned the position on June 1, 2009.

On June 29, 2010, Allred was pulled over by Burlington police officers who observed him swerving into the lane opposite his and refused to take a sobriety test. At this point he was taken to the police station where he was given an alcohol-breath test but was unable to produce a sufficient amount of breath to produce a reading (he claimed that due to his bronchitis he was unable to produce enough breath) which resulted in it being recorded as a fail.

<text>George Wayne Goodwin (born February 22, 1967) is an American politician. He was elected North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance in the 2008 election and re-elected in 2012. He was narrowly defeated in his bid for a third term in 2016. However, he quickly rebounded and was elected on February 11, 2017, as chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party on the first ballot with 92% of the vote among four candidates.

Goodwin previously served as a Democratic member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state&#x27;s sixty-eighth House district, including constituents in Richmond and Stanly counties. His prior district – the 32nd House district – also included Scotland and Montgomery Counties.

==Political career==
=== State Legislator ===
After serving as President of the Young Democrats of North Carolina, Goodwin served four full terms in the North Carolina state House. Goodwin campaigned as the Democratic nominee for the position of North Carolina Commissioner of Labor in the 2004 election, losing in a close race to incumbent Republican Cherie Berry.

=== Insurance Commissioner ===
Goodwin served as the Assistant Commissioner of Insurance and Assistant State Fire Marshal for the State of North Carolina from 2005 through 2008. In 2008, Goodwin filed to run for Commissioner of Insurance after the surprise retirement of longtime Commissioner Jim Long. Goodwin defeated David Smith in the Democratic primary 56%–43% and went on to beat Republican John Odom and Libertarian Mark McMains with 51.57% of the vote. He was sworn in on January 10, 2009. Goodwin won re-election in the 2012 general contest by almost four percentage points.

=== NC Democratic Party Chair ===
He was a candidate for re-election to his post in 2016. After very narrowly losing the general election, Goodwin announced that he would run for chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party. With the support of 92% of ballots cast, he was elected to lead the state party on Feb. 11, 2017. Two years later, in January 2019, Goodwin won unanimous re-election to a second term as chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party. After completing a customary second term, Goodwin chose to refrain from a third term soon after his wife died from cancer and he had two children to raise. His first vice chair, Bobbie Richardson, succeeded Goodwin as party chair.

He unsuccessfully sought a third (non-consecutive) term as insurance commissioner in the 2020 election.

=== DMV Commissioner ===
In 2022, Goodwin was appointed commissioner of the North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles. As commissioner, he lifted various restrictions for LGBT speech on vanity plates. Previously, vanity plates with LGBT content were not permitted by the Division. Under the direction of Goodwin, the DMV cracked down on racist and antisemitic vanity plates that had been approved due to creative spelling used to get around DMV restrictions.

Goodwin has also made several changes as commissioner to streamline DMV service. He has implemented extended walk-in hours and extended business hours at several DMV locations, as well as expanded online services. He has also announced the introduction of DMV self-service kiosks in places such as pharmacies and grocery stores, allowing DMV customers to renew their license and registration while shopping for groceries or picking up prescriptions.

==Personal life==
Goodwin was a Morehead Scholar and US Senate/William Randolph Hearst Scholar. He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in political science and then went on to graduate from the UNC School of Law. While at UNC, he was a member of the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies. He was married to Melanie Wade Goodwin, also a former state legislator and attorney, until her death at age 50 in 2020. They are the parents of two children.

<text>Jacob Curtis Blackwood Jr. (born October 17, 1942) was a Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state&#x27;s sixty-eighth House district, including constituents in Union county. A property manager from Matthews, North Carolina, Blackwood succeeded Fern Shubert when she left to run for North Carolina Senate. He decided not to run for another term in 2010.

==Early life and education==
Jacob Curtis Blackwood Jr. was born October 17, 1942, in Charlotte, North Carolina. He received his BA in History from the University of Georgia in 1965. He continued his studies at Ohio University receiving a Masters in Educational Administration in 1967 before returning to the University of Georgia and graduating with an EdD in 1972.

Prior to becoming a rental property owner and manager, Blackwood was an educator and school administrator from 1965 to 1983.

==Political career==
===1996 Congressional campaign===
Blackwood ran for Congress in 1996 against long-term incumbent Bill Hefner. That year, Blackwood&#x27;s main primary opponent was car dealer Sherrill Morgan who was the Republicans&#x27; 1994 nominee to face Hefner. Morgan only lost by four percentage points in 1994 and was heavily favored to win the nomination to face Hefner again. Morgan did not get enough votes to avoid a run-off election and Blackwood won the run-off with almost 64% of the vote. He went on to lose the general election to Hefner.

===1998 State senate campaign===
Blackwood next sought to win a seat in the North Carolina Senate in 1998 in the 17th district. There were two seats available in the district and Blackwood along with fellow Republican Don Dawkins challenged incumbent Democrats Aaron Plyler and Bill Purcell. Both incumbents won re-election.

<text>Harold J. Brubaker is a Republican politician who served in the North Carolina General Assembly. He represented the state&#x27;s seventy-eighth House district, including constituents in Randolph County, for 35 years. He resigned in 2012 with plans to become a lobbyist. At the time he was the longest-serving sitting member of the House.

He was born and grew up in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

Brubaker was Speaker of the House for two terms (1995–1998). He was the only Republican Speaker in North Carolina in the twentieth century, the first Republican speaker since Zeb V. Walser (1895) and the first non-Democrat to be speaker since Populist A. F. Hileman (1897).

A real estate appraiser and cattle breeder from Asheboro, North Carolina, Brubaker was first elected to the House in 1976 and in 2011 became chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.

He is a board member and chairman emeritus of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).

==Election history==
2010


==Controversies==
In 1989, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Brubaker was paid $10,000 to assist developers in Durham, North Carolina, regarding a real estate project that drew scrutiny from authorities. The project involved converting a hosiery mill into homes for the elderly, and caused concern when subordinates had reportedly been against the project, but funds were appropriated nevertheless.

<text>Edgar Vance Starnes is a North Carolina politician and an investor in real estate. He served as a Republican member of the North Carolina House of Representatives for a total of approximately 20 years, from 1987 to 1988 and from 1997 through January 2015. He then resigned to become legislative liaison for North Carolina State Treasurer Janet Cowell. At the time of his resignation, Starnes represented the state&#x27;s eighty-seventh House district (Caldwell County).

==North Carolina House of Representatives==

He was elected House Majority Leader by his colleagues in December 2012, for the legislative session beginning in January 2013. After the 2014 election, in which he was re-elected to the House without opposition, Starnes chose not to seek a second term as Majority Leader because he was already discussing the position with the State Treasurer&#x27;s office.

===Nullification resolution===
In April 2013, Starnes and ten Republican colleagues introduced House Bill 494, a resolution in the Assembly which repudiates any federal court power in ruling on any Constitutional topic in North Carolina, a legally discredited theory known to historians of the antebellum U.S. as nullification.

&quot;The Constitution of the United States does not grant the federal government and does not grant the federal courts the power to determine what is or is not constitutional; therefore, by virtue of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the power to determine constitutionality and the proper interpretation and proper application of the Constitution is reserved to the states and to the people,&quot; the resolution asserts, continuing, &quot;Each state in the union is sovereign and may independently determine how that state may make laws respecting an establishment of religion&quot;.

<doc id="451622" wikidata="Q1636104" url="?curid=451622" title="Catoblepas">
<text>The catoblepas (from Latin , ultimately from Greek καταβλέπω (katablépō) &quot;to look downwards&quot;) is a legendary creature from Aethiopia, first described by Pliny the Elder and later by Claudius Aelianus.

One known description of the Catoblepas is said to resemble a cape buffalo, with its head always pointing downwards due to its great weight. Its stare or breath could either turn people into stone, or kill them. The catoblepas is often thought to be based on real-life encounters with wildebeest, such that some dictionaries say that the word is synonymous with &quot;gnu&quot;. Other depictions have it sporting the head of a hog and the body of a cape buffalo. It is sometimes known as an African version of a Gorgon.

==Ancient and medieval descriptions==
Pliny the Elder (&quot;Natural History&quot;, 8.77) described the catoblepas as a mid-sized creature, sluggish, with a heavy head and a face always turned to the ground. He thought its gaze, like that of the basilisk, was lethal, making the heaviness of its head quite fortunate.

Pomponius Mela (&quot;Chorographia,&quot; 3.98) echoes the description given by Pliny the Elder though also notes that the creature is fairly passive and not known to physically attack others.

Timotheus of Gaza (&quot;On Animals&quot;, 53) says that the catoblepas emits fire from its nostrils.

Claudius Aelianus (&quot;On the Nature of Animals&quot;, 7.6) provided a fuller description: the creature was a mid-sized herbivore, about the size of a domestic bull, with a heavy mane, narrow, bloodshot eyes, a scaly back and shaggy eyebrows. The head was so heavy that the beast could only look down. In his description, the animal&#x27;s gaze was not lethal, but its breath was poison, since it ate only poisonous vegetation.

Constantine Manasses (2, 39) mentions the &quot;fire-breathing katobleps&quot;.

==In literature==
The catoblepas is described in &quot;The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci&quot;:
It is found in Ethiopia near to the source Nigricapo. It is not a very large animal, is sluggish in all its parts, and its head is so large that it carries it with difficulty, in such wise that it always droops towards the ground; otherwise it would be a great pest to man, for any one on whom it fixes its eyes dies immediately.

In &quot;The Temptation of Saint Anthony&quot; (1874), Gustave Flaubert describes it as:

... a black buffalo with the head of a hog, hanging close to the ground, joined to its body by a thin neck, long and loose as an emptied intestine.
It wallows flat upon the ground, and its legs are smothered under the huge mane of stiff bristles that hide its face.

In &quot;The Countess of Pembroke&#x27;s Arcadia&quot; (&quot;The New Arcadia&quot;) (c. 1570–1586), by Sir Philip Sidney, the &quot;forsaken knight&quot; that Amphilalus fights has a Catoblepas upon his crest:

So passed he over into the island, taking with him the two brothers of Anaxius; where he found the forsaken knight attired in his own livery, as black as sorrow itself could see itself in the blackest glass: his ornaments of the same hue, but formd into the figures of ravens which seemed to gape for carrion: only his reins were snakes, which finely wrapping themselves one within the other, their heads came together to the cheeks and bosses of the bit, where they might seem to bite at the horse, and the horse, as he champed the bit, to bite at them, and that the white foam was engendered by the poisonous fury of the combat. His impresa was a Catoblepta, which so long lies dead as the moon (whereto it hath so natural a sympathy) wants her light. The word signified, that the moon wanted not the light, but the poor beast wanted the moon&#x27;s light.

The Catoblepas was listed in the &quot;Book of Imaginary Beings&quot; (1957) by Jorge Luis Borges. It is described as a black buffalo with a hog&#x27;s head that is always looking down.

A catoblepas appears in &quot;A Spell for Chameleon&quot; (1977) by Piers Anthony. In the book, the catoblepas fights an argus and a harpy, all of which want to devour the protagonist, Bink. It is described as follows:

[Bink] sat up. One leg remained anchored-but now he had anchorage to rip out of the clutch of the demon weed. It didn&#x27;t even hurt this time. He looked at the battling monsters-and saw the snakelike hair of the catoblepas twined around the head of the argus, gripping it by horns, ears, scales, and eyeballs-anything available. The body of the catoblepas was covered with reptilian scales, from its gorgon head to its cloven hooves, invulnerable to the attack of the argus. In overall shape it was like any quadruped, not all that remarkable; but that deadly writhing prehensile head hair-what a horror!

==In other media==
*The Catoblepas appeared in the roleplaying game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in two distinct forms. It first appeared under the name &quot;Catoblepas&quot; in 1976, in the TSR-published magazine The Strategic Review, issue #7 and continued to appear in various editions of the game rules with evolving attributes. TSR also included a creature in its game called the gorgon based on the catoblepas of legend, but resembling iron-scaled cattle. This interpretation of gorgon appears as a unit in &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic III&quot; as well.
*The catoblepas appears as creature cards in the &quot;Theros&quot; and &quot;Theros Beyond Death&quot; expansion sets of the collectible card game &quot;&quot;.
*The catoblepas appears as a common enemy in the &quot;Castlevania&quot; video games. Its description varies in different games where it can resemble a gray ox and an armored bull. The catoblepas has a weaker counterpart called the gorgon which can breathe poison.
*In Rick Riordan&#x27;s 2013 &quot;The Heroes of Olympus&quot; book &quot;The House of Hades&quot;, the catoblepas appears with the name Katobleps (Ancient Greek ) in the form of creatures resembling cow monsters. They are shown to have a poisonous gaze and a poisonous breath.
*An invalid binomial name for the Black wildebeest is &quot;Catoblepas operculatus&quot; as coined by Brookes (1828), likely in reference to both its horns and downturned head.
*The Catoblepas inspired several Monster Cards in the collectible card game &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;.
*The Catoblepas appears in RuneScape with the name &quot;Catablepon&quot;.
*Catoblepas meat is mentioned as preferred food of a spoiled princess in The Witcher (video game).

<doc id="451624" wikidata="Q5541950" url="?curid=451624" title="George M. Holmes">
<text>George Milton Holmes (June 20, 1929 – December 31, 2009) was a Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state&#x27;s 92nd House district, including constituents in eastern Surry, northern Iredell and Yadkin counties. A retiree from Hamptonville, North Carolina, Holmes began serving his sixteenth term in January 2007. He was one of the longest serving North Carolina legislators. He died on December 31, 2009, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

==Early life==
Holmes, a native of Mount Airy, North Carolina, was a 1954 graduate of Appalachian State University. At Appalachian, he received a football scholarship. Holmes married Barbara Ireland, the daughter of William Nelson Ireland, who was also a state legislator in the 1950s.

He taught at West Yadkin High School from 1954 to 1956, coaching football, baseball and basketball. In 1956, he joined W. N. Ireland Insurance Company in Yadkinville, North Carolina. He later became president and co-owner.

==Political life==
Holmes was first elected to state office in 1974 and was defeated only once, in the post-Watergate backlash against Republicans in 1976. He was the minority whip from 1981 to 1982 and minority party joint caucus leader from 1983 to 1984. When Republicans took over the state House in 1995, Holmes gained considerable power as the co-chairman of the House Appropriations Committee from 1995 to 1998.

In 2003, Holmes, the senior Republican, was a candidate for speaker of the state House. Holmes was a compromise candidate after five Republicans refused to support Rep. Leo Daughtry. Republican Rep. Richard T. Morgan ended Holmes&#x27; bid when he and his allies orchestrated a power-sharing deal with Democrat Jim Black.

The George M. Holmes Convocation Center, an 8,325 seat arena in Boone, North Carolina, is named for Holmes, who was instrumental in bringing in state funds for the project.

Holmes was popular in his district, which is overwhelmingly Republican. He ran unopposed in the 2006 and 2004 elections, and had a Libertarian challenger in 2002.

===Campaign finance questions===
In December 2006, Holmes was criticized after it was reported he wrote three checks to himself totaling more than $79,000 from his campaign finance account. The last payment from the account was four days before a new law limiting personal use of campaign money took effect.

Holmes defended the transfer, saying what he did was within the law.

&quot;Through 32 years of serving in the General Assembly, I accumulated more than I had to spend for my campaign,&quot; Holmes told the &quot;Winston-Salem Journal&quot;. &quot;I see nothing wrong with a person who has accumulated excess funds through the years using that money because it was given with no strings attached.&quot;

===Recent news===
In the 2007-08 session of the legislature, Holmes was a member of these committees: Appropriations, Aging, Election Law and Campaign Finance Reform, Financial Institutions, Judiciary, Public Utilities, and University Board of Governors Nominating. He also is vice-chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation.

Holmes was hospitalized in March 2007 for pneumonia and to receive some treatment for his heart. He was back at his desk by March 26, 2007.

In 2008, Holmes cited his health when he declined to run for a 17th term.

<text>ShareReactor was an index site for files on the eDonkey network and Torrent files. ShareReactor did not host any files; instead, the links it contained were accessible through an eDonkey network and BitTorrent client. The site was taken down by Swiss Police on March 10, 2004, due to the suspicion of breach of copyright and trademark laws. After a long downtime of nearly two years and six months, the site returned online under new ownership. However nearly two months after its return it once again closed down due to lack of popularity. In December 2008 the site was reopened once more brought back to life with help from the Pirate Bay team. Its notability is still known today as a search on any p2p network will show many thousands of files tagged with Sharereactor in their name.

ShareReactor delivers links that can be used together with a P2P client program that understands eD2k links or torrent files.

== Origin ==
The site was founded on August 5, 2001, by Geraldine Arlington using the pseudonym &#x27;Gowenna&#x27;. The site was initially located at Gowenna.da.ru, which was only a shadow domain. The site was renamed ShareReactor in November 2001 and used an official domain due to its great popularity. In January 2002, it was announced that Gowenna had died in a car accident due to icy road conditions. The site administration was continued by Christian Riesen (aka Simon Moon) who programmed the system and was responsible for technical work on the site and hosting. The site&#x27;s popularity persisted, eventually even growing further. ShareReactor remained the top eD2k indexing website up until March 2004 when it suddenly was closed due to suspicion of breach of copyright and trademark laws within the country of Switzerland where ShareReactor&#x27;s owner lived and where ShareReactor was being hosted.

== Takedown ==
ShareReactor was taken down by the local police in the Canton of Thurgau, Switzerland on March 10, 2004, due to the suspicion of breach of copyright and trademark laws. The investigation was reportedly initiated by complaints from the Swiss Anti-Piracy-Federation (SAFE) at the request of several large corporations, one of them presumably being Columbia Tri-Star Inc.

== Reopening and Closure ==

ShareReactor came back online after nearly two years and six months of being offline. Before ShareReactor&#x27;s full return in September 2006, ShareReactor made a partial return, which was in June 2004 when their forum was put back online. However the difference was all the sections of the forum that featured eD2k links were closed due to the request they received a few months before. The return of ShareReactor&#x27;s forum was until around November 2004 when the place that was hosting the forum had a major power surge and the servers were destroyed. On the last known occasion of ShareReactor&#x27;s forum being online, there were around 1,100,000 posts.

When ShareReactor made a full return was on September 4, 2006. Prior to their reopening, a mass e-mail was sent to all the users of ShareReactor and users of related sites, such as RespectP2P. ShareReactor was back although things were a bit different: the site was under new ownership, had a new design, and featured better controls within the website. A noticeable difference was the site owner and administrator, SimonMoon, who ran the site from January 2002 until March 2004 choose not to be involved within the site since it was still under investigation. The database used for the homepage was a backup taken on March 10, 2004 (the day of ShareReactor&#x27;s closure), and the forum database was from a backup taken on December 29, 2002 (about one year and three months prior to the closure). When ShareReactor&#x27;s forum returned, there were only around 420,000 posts, which means a loss of 680,000 posts. Very few staff members of ShareReactor were active when the site reopened, the staff were: XTRiCiAN, Maxaiqa, Piratsvin, Seth, and sUiZiD. Prior to ShareReactor being closed down, there was a staff of about twenty administrators and thirty-five forum moderators, a significant amount compared to when ShareReactor reopened.

In late October 2006, ShareReactor closed down once again. The closure was due to lack of popularity within the site. In February 2008 a Swiss district court finally sentenced the prior owner of Sharereactor to a fine of 2,000 CHF ( US$1,827.11 ) nearly four years after the website was first shut down by the authorities.

== The Second Reopening ==
On December 17, 2008, the site reopened once again as a combined eDonkey and BitTorrent site, this time affiliated with The Pirate Bay which hosts the site and tracks the torrents. The focus is to offer the newest content as torrent files but also keep the library of eD2k links up to date. The current site team has made roughly a third of the site releases. The forums run on backups which dates back to 2002. According to a post by the Sharereactor team and Alexa, the site is continuing to grow again. As of July 2010, the forum had been closed without notice, however, it has soon after being reopened.

== Closing ==

As of August 5, 2011, Sharereactor.com has fallen into silence once again, exactly ten years after its initial launch on August 5, 2001.

<text>Ifrit, also spelled as efreet, afrit, and afreet ( ), plural ), is a powerful type of demon in Islamic culture. The ʿafārīt are often associated with the underworld and identified with the spirits of the dead, and have been compared to evil &quot;geniī loci&quot; in European culture. In Quran, hadith, and Mi&#x27;raj narrations the term is always followed by the phrase &quot;among the jinn&quot;. In later folklore, they developed into independent entities, identified as powerful demons or spirits of the dead who sometimes inhabit desolate places such as ruins and temples. Their true habitat is the Jahannam or underworld.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;ifrit&quot; appears in Surah an-Naml: 39 of the Quran, but only as an epithet and not to designate a specific type of demon. The term itself is not found in pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, although variants such as &quot;ifriya&quot; and &quot;ifr&quot; are recorded prior to the Quran. Traditionally, Arab philologists trace the derivation of the word to . It is further used to describe sly, malicious, wicked and cunning characteristics.

Some Western philologists suggest a foreign origin of the word and attribute it to Middle Persian &quot;āfrītan&quot;, which corresponds to New Persian &quot;to create&quot;, but this is regarded as unlikely by others. Johnny Cheung argued that there is a Zoroastrian spirit called an &quot;āfriti-&quot; in Avestan. He suggests that this Avestan term might be the ultimate source of Arabic &quot;‘ifrīt&quot;.&quot;

In folklore, the term developed into a designation of a specific class of demon, though most Islamic scholarly traditions regard the term as an adjective. Popular beliefs were elaborated in works such as in al-Ibshīhī&#x27;s &quot;Mustatraf&quot;. They became identified either as a dangerous kind of devil (&quot;shayṭān&quot;) preying on women, or as spirits of the dead. In Turkish, the term is used for demons of the underworld.

==Islamic scriptures==
In Islamic scriptures the term &quot;ifrit&quot; is always followed by the expression &quot;of the jinn&quot;. Due to the ambiguous meaning of the term &quot;jinn&quot;, which is applied to a wide range of different spirits, their relation towards the genus of jinn remains vague. However, within the Islamic scriptures, the term is used as an epithet to describe a powerful or malicious spirit of an undefined nature.

In the Quran, such an ifrit is mentioned in surah al-Naml 27:38-40. The ifrit offers to carry the throne of Bilqis, queen of Sheba to King Solomon: &quot;An ifrit from the jinn said: &#x27;I will bring it to you before you rise from your place. And verily, I am indeed strong and trustworthy for such work.&quot; However, the duty is not given to him, but to somebody endowed with knowledge of the scripture. An &quot;ifrit among the jinn&quot; is mentioned in a &quot;hadith&quot; of Muhammad al-Bukhari, attempting to interrupt the prayers of Muhammad and in a narrative of Muhammad&#x27;s night journey recorded in the eighth century by Malik ibn Anas. In the latter account, the &quot;ifrit among the jinn&quot; threatens Muhammad with a fiery presence, after which the Archangel Gabriel taught Muhammad a prayer to defeat it. Muslim texts explain, God sent the ifrit on purpose so that Gabriel might teach Muhammad and his &quot;ummah&quot; (Muslim community) to overcome their fear of demons at night.

&quot;Tafsīr&quot; of Surah al-Anbiya, on the story of the prophet Job, mentions Job being tested by the torment of three ifrits. After Iblis gains permission to test Job, he descends to earth and summons his most powerful devils (&quot;shaytan&quot;) and ifrits. In order to torment the prophet, they turn into storms and whirlwinds of fire to destroy Job&#x27;s properties.

==Islamic folklore==
In Islamic folklore, the afarit became a class of chthonic spirits, inhabiting the layers of the seven earths, generally ruthless and wicked, formed out of smoke and fire. Despite their negative depictions and affiliation to the nether regions, afarit are not fundamentally evil on a moral plane; they might even carry out God&#x27;s purpose. Such obligations can nevertheless be ruthless, such as obligation to blood vengeance and avenging murder. Nizami Ganjavi describes an &quot;ifrit&quot; tormenting Mahan, as created from &quot;God&#x27;s wrath&quot;, thus underpinning the ifrit&#x27;s role secondary to God&#x27;s will. Further, an ifrit can be compelled by a sorcerer, if summoned.

===Egypt===
Although afarit are not necessarily components of a person, but independent entities, a common belief in Islamic Egypt
associates afarit with part of a human&#x27;s soul.

Probably influenced by the Ancient Egypt idea of &quot;Ka&quot;, the afarit are often identified with the spirits of the dead, departing from the body at the moment of death. They live in cemeteries, wander around places the dead person frequently visited, or roam the earth close to the place of death, until the Day of Judgment. A person who died a natural death does not have a malevolent ifrit. Only people who are killed give rise to a dangerous and active ifrit, drawn to the blood of the victim. Driving an unused nail into the blood is supposed to stop their formation. Such afarit might scare and even kill the living or take revenge on the murderer. Martyrs, saints and prophets do not have a ghost, and therefore no ifrit.

===Morocco===
In Moroccan belief, the afarit form a more powerful type of demon, comparable to jinn and other supernatural creatures. They have more substantial existence, and are greater in scale and capacity than other demons. Their physical appearance is often portrayed as having monstrous deformities, such as claw-like or thorny hands, flaming eyes or seven heads.

Just as with jinn, an ifrit might possess an individual. Such persons gain some abilities from the ifrit, such as getting stronger and more brave, but the ifrit renders them insane. With the aid of a magical ring, the afarit might be forced to perform certain orders, such as carrying heavy stones.

===Shabakism===
A story circulates among the Shabak community in Northern Iraq about a certain ifrit who incensed Ali by his evil nature long before the creation of Adam. Consequently, for the ifrit&#x27;s wickedness, Ali chained the ifrit and left him alone. When the prophets arrived on earth, he appeared to all of them, beginning with Adam, and begged them for his release, but no prophet was able to break the chains. When Muhammad met the ifrit, he brought him to Ali for release. Ali was merciful to the ifrit, and decided to release him under the condition that he surrenders to the will of God.

===Mahan and the Ifrit===

Nizami Ganjavi (c. 1141–1209) narrates in his &quot;Haft Peykar&quot; the story of the Egyptian wayfarer Māhān (the &quot;moonlike one&quot;) and his travels to a demon-infested desert. Māhān&#x27;s horse, presented to him by a demon in human disguise, gallops his rider into the desert, where it turns into a seven-headed monster. In the desert, Māhān finds shelter in a mysterious oasis owned by an old man. After Māhān and the old man know each other better, the old man decides to bequeath his legacy and marry him to a beautiful woman. He leaves to prepare for the wedding and warns Māhān that he must not descend from the perch until the old man is back. After that, the house, garden, and wife will belong to him.

When a beautiful girl with the face of a &quot;parī&quot; (fairy) enters the room, Māhān is overwhelmed by his lust and passion and ignores the order of the old man. While the beauty of his desire embraces Māhān, the girl suddenly turns into an ifrit, formed from God&#x27;s wrath. The demon explains that the fairy turned into a demon because of Māhān&#x27;s uncontrollable passion. Thereupon, the ifrit explains that he now must tear Māhān apart; if it were to spare him, the monster would be no true demon (&quot;dēw&quot;). Furthermore, the demon considers it ashamed to present as a fairy in the first place. Māhān is saved when the rooster sounds in the morning and everything demonic vanishes.

Nizami notes that the meaning of the story is that the ifrit is the consequence of Māhān&#x27;s moral transgression. The ifrits in the story feature as moral instance and guardians of moral order.

==In fiction==
Afarit appear already in early poems, such as those of Al-Maʿarri (973–1057), who describes his protagonist visiting a paradise with &quot;narrow straits&quot; and &quot;dark valleys&quot; for afarit, between heaven and hell. In later works, the afarit are mentioned among the narratives collected in &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. In one tale called &quot;The Porter and the Young Girls&quot;, a prince is attacked by pirates and takes refuge with a woodcutter. The prince finds an underground chamber in the forest leading to a beautiful woman who has been kidnapped by an ifrit. The prince sleeps with the woman and both are attacked by the jealous ifrit, who changes the prince into an ape. Later a princess restores the prince and fights a pitched battle with the ifrit, who changes shape into various animals, fruit, and fire until being reduced to cinders. In &quot;The Fisherman and the Jinni&quot; an ifrit, locked in a jar by the Seal of Solomon, is released but later tricked by the fisherman again into the jar. Under the condition that the ifrit aids him to achieve riches, he releases the ifrit again. The latter ifrit, however, might be substituted by a marid, another type of powerful demon easily tricked by the protagonist. The latter portrayal of an ifrit, as a wish-granting spirit released from a jar, became characteristic of Western depictions of jinn.

Afarit feature frequently in film and video games. In the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; video game series, an ifrit appears as a summonable spirit and an enemy. Like its mythological counterpart, it is a spirit of fire and can use an iconic spell called &quot;Hellfire&quot;. In the fifth season of &quot;True Blood&quot; (2012), an ifrit seeks vengeance for murder of Iraqi civilians by U.S soldiers. In both the novel &quot;American Gods&quot; (2001) and the television adaptation by Neil Gaiman an ifrit disguised as a taxi-driver appears, trying to get used to his new role, seeking intimacy in a lonely world.

<doc id="451628" wikidata="Q16207791" url="?curid=451628" title="Michael P. Decker">
<text>Michael Paul Decker Sr. (born December 18, 1944) is a former member of the North Carolina House of Representatives who represented the 94th district, including constituents in Forsyth County. A former teacher from Walkertown, North Carolina, Decker served 10 terms in the state House, ending with the 2003-2004 session. He was born in Red Bud, Illinois.

==Bribery scandal==
Just before the opening of the 2003–2004 legislative session, Decker, an outspoken conservative, switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party. This led to a 60–60 split in the House, producing a power-sharing arrangement between the two parties. Prior to his switch, the Republicans had a 61-59 majority, and therefore were set to control the state House. Shortly before the 2004 elections, Decker switched back to the Republican Party. He was defeated in the 2004 Republican primary by Larry R. Brown of Kernersville who went on to win the general election.

In August 2006, Decker pleaded guilty in federal court to receiving $50,000 in cash and checks as well as a legislative job for his son, all in exchange for supporting Democrat Jim Black for the Speaker of the House position (although Black was not mentioned by name in Decker&#x27;s federal plea deal). The bribe was made in the form of an envelope containing $38,000 in blank checks from Black&#x27;s fellow North Carolina optometrists, plus $12,000 in cash from an undisclosed source. The envelope was transferred to Decker by a Democratic member of the House, at a Salisbury, North Carolina, IHOP restaurant. Black&#x27;s office has said that at some point in 2002, Decker met Jim Black at the IHOP in Salisbury to talk.

Black maintained that the $50,000 was campaign funding support from the House Leader to a new Democratic Party member. Decker maintained it was a bribe for him to switch parties so that Black could remain Speaker of the House. In 2007, Black pleaded guilty, (but did not actually admit guilt) to essentially what Decker alleged.

On April 27, 2007, Decker was sentenced to four years in prison and a $50,000 fine for his involvement in the scheme. The sentence was twice what the prosecution was seeking. U.S. District Court Judge James C. Dever III called the scheme &quot;an epic betrayal.&quot; He reported to a federal prison in South Carolina in September 2007.

<text>James Boyce Black (born March 25, 1935) is a member of the North Carolina Democratic Party, and a former member of the North Carolina General Assembly, who represented the state&#x27;s 100th House district, including constituents in Mecklenburg County. An optometrist from Matthews, North Carolina, Black was elected to 11 (non-consecutive) terms in the House of Representatives, and served as Speaker of the House from January 1999 through the end of 2006, when scandal forced him to give up the leadership post. For the 2003-2004 legislative session Black was elected to serve as &quot;Co-Speaker&quot; with Republican Richard T. Morgan serving as the other Co-Speaker.

Black earned an O.D. from the Southern College of Optometry. He served in the United States Navy and in the United States Naval Reserve.

==Fall from power==
In 2005 and 2006, Black was linked to a series of scandals involving, among other things, the party-switching Rep. Michael P. Decker, and the North Carolina lottery, established the previous year. The proceedings led to convictions for several involved figures, including Decker, media and public relations consultant Kevin L. Geddings and political aide Meredith Norris. Decker testified under oath that he instigated a bribery scheme of which Black was alleged to be a &quot;co-conspirator&quot;. Black has consistently denied those allegations.

Although Black was not indicted while serving as speaker, the situation drew ire from the North Carolina Republican Party, which involved the scandal in their November election campaigns.

Black was re-elected in November 2006, over Republican political novice Hal Jordan. Meanwhile, he led efforts to increase the Democratic majority in the State House.

In December 2006, Black announced that he would not seek another term as Speaker. That was followed in January 2007 by his announcement that he would not run for re-election to the House in 2008.

Black pleaded guilty to a federal charge of public corruption on February 15, 2007, a felony carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He admitted to accepting funds from chiropractors while their professional group had legislation pending in the North Carolina General Assembly. As a result, he resigned from the General Assembly on February 14, 2007.

Federal prosecutors have said the plea deal with Black involves his assistance in their continued investigation into political corruption in North Carolina government.

Black&#x27;s agreement with federal prosecutors did not protect him from state prosecution. Indeed, days after his federal plea, he entered into a separate Alford plea agreement with the district attorney of Wake County, whose jurisdiction includes the state capital, Raleigh.

On July 11, 2007, Black was sentenced by Judge Terrence Boyle to five years, three months in prison, three years of probation, and a $50,000 fine. Black was sentenced in state court as well in 2007 and 2009, but was allowed to serve his state sentences concurrently with his federal prison time.

In 2010, Black was released from federal prison in Georgia and returned to Mecklenburg County to serve the remaining six months of his term either at a halfway house or under house arrest.
