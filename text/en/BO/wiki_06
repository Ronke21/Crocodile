<text>The Ohio High School Speech League (OHSSL) is the body that organizes high school forensic competition in the state of Ohio. The OHSSL provides all of the National Forensic League events, but also provides several other events including Declamation. In the 2001-2002 season, Impromptu Speaking was added as an experimental event. The following year Impromptu was made an official OHSSL event. Following the 2013-2014 season, Impromptu was removed as an OHSSL event. OHSSL also offers many other common events such as debate (Public Forum, Policy, Congress, and Lincoln-Douglas) and IE events such as International and United States Extemporaneous Speaking, Duo Interpretation, Dramatic Interpretation, Humorous Interpretation, Program Oral Interpretation, and Original Oratory. Each of the state districts takes part in a district tournament, called &quot;Littles&quot;, where a set number of people can move on to compete in the State Championship.

The Sharen Althoff US Extemp Award is an award given to the US Extemporaneous Speaker who receives the most firsts in rounds for the duration of the tournament.

== History ==
The OHSSL was founded as the Ohio High School Debating League in fall 1927 by the public speaking division of the English Department of Ohio State University. The original membership was composed of 25 high schools, entered by the first director, Glenn Ross. Youngstown East High School won the first state tournament, beating Marietta High School. In 1928, the number of member schools in the Debating League grew to 67 schools, with Hicksville High School winning the state tournament over Ravenna High School.

In 1935, Donald Riley became the director of the League, 88 schools in number at that time. In 1937, new director James Carrell renamed the Ohio High School Debating League to the Ohio High School Speech League, with 145 member schools. The Extempore speech event was also added that year.

In 1939, the membership grew to 165 high schools, and director Walter Emery added four new events: Original Oratory, Oratorical Interpretation, Dramatic Interpretation, and Humorous Interpretation.

==Districts==
The OHSSL is divided into districts.
*Akron District

<doc id="447490" wikidata="Q3916752" url="?curid=447490" title="Dennis Miller Live">
<text>Dennis Miller Live was an American weekly late night talk show on HBO, hosted by comedian Dennis Miller. The show ran 215 episodes from 1994 to 2002, and received five Emmy awards and 11 Emmy nominations. It was also nominated six times for the Writers Guild of America Award for &quot;Best Writing For A Comedy/Variety Series&quot;, and won three of those six times.

The show was idea of HBO executive producer Michael Fuchs, who told Miller he could use any forum he wanted as long as he brought in the numbers. It was directed by Debbie Palacio for most of its run, and head writers were first Jeff Cesario and then Eddie Feldmann. Other writers included Jos√© Arroyo, Rich Dahm, Ed Driscoll, David Feldman, Mike Gandolfi, Jim Hanna, Tom Hertz, Leah Krinsky, Rob Kutner, Rick Overton, Jacob Sager Weinstein, and David S. Weiss.

==Format==
The show had a small set without a house band. It mainly consisted of Miller speaking to the largely unseen studio audience on a darkened stage. The show&#x27;s cold opening started with Miller doing a brief joke about a current event.

The credit sequence showed Miller in a pool hall playing by himself set to &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; by Tears for Fears, though music was changed in later seasons for cost reasons. In later seasons, the sequence was changed to show oversized toppling dominoes featuring images of political and social leaders.

Then Miller would perform a two-part monologue which often segued into a stream-of-consciousness &quot;rant&quot; that became Miller&#x27;s trademark, starting with the catchphrase &quot;Now I don&#x27;t want to get off on a rant here...&quot; and ended with the phrase &quot;Of course, that&#x27;s just my opinion, I could be wrong.&quot; Books that compiled these monologues were released, starting with 1996&#x27;s &quot;The Rants&quot; and ending with 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Rant Zone&quot;.

Miller would discuss the topic of the day with one guest per show. During the guest segment, the show would also take phone calls. The call-in number was originally given as 1-800-LACTOSE. Reportedly, Miller chose the word &quot;lactose&quot; because it was the only word he could make with seven digits to make it a vanity number.

At the end of the interview, Miller would tell the guest &quot;Stick around, I&#x27;ve gotta go do the news&quot;. Black-and-white photographs from newspapers would be shown, and Miller would make humorous captions regarding them. At the finish of this segment, Miller would harken back to his &quot;SNL&quot; days by saying &quot;That&#x27;s the news, and I am outta here!&quot;

<text>Policy debate is an American form of debate competition in which teams of two usually advocate for and against a resolution that typically calls for policy change by the United States federal government. It is also referred to as cross-examination debate (sometimes shortened to Cross-X or CX) because of the 3-minute questioning period following each constructive speech. Evidence presentation is a crucial part of policy debate. The main argument being debated during a round is to change or not change the status quo. When a team explains why their solvency is greater than the opposition&#x27;s, they compare advantages. One team‚Äôs job is to argue that the resolution‚Äîthe statement that a specific change to a national or international problem should be made‚Äîis a good idea. Affirmative teams generally present a &quot;plan&quot; as a proposal for implementation of the resolution. On the other hand, the Negative teams present arguments against the implementation of the resolution. In a single round of debate competition, each person gives two speeches. The first speech each person gives is called a ‚Äúconstructive‚Äù speech, because it is the speech when the first person of the team speaks positively, presenting the team&#x27;s main idea without rebuttals that have not occurred, presents the basic arguments they will make throughout the debate. The second speech is called a ‚Äúrebuttal‚Äù, because this is the speech where each person tries to rebut (or refute) the arguments made by the other team, while using their own arguments to try to persuade the judge to vote for their team. The Affirmative has to persuade the judge to vote for the resolution, while the Negative has to persuade the judge the Negative&#x27;s position is a better idea.

High school policy debate is sponsored by various organizations including the National Speech and Debate Association, National Association of Urban Debate Leagues, Catholic Forensic League, Stoa USA, and the National Christian Forensics and Communications Association, as well as many other regional speech organizations. Collegiate policy debates are generally governed by the guidelines of National Debate Tournament (NDT) and the Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA), which have been joined at the collegiate level. A one-person policy format is sanctioned by the National Forensic Association (NFA)) on the collegiate level as well.

==History==
Academic debate had its origins in intra-collegiate debating societies, in which students would engage in invitational debates against their classmates. Wake Forest University&#x27;s debate program claims to have its origins in student literary societies founded on campus in the mid-1830s, which first presented joint &quot;orations&quot; in 1854. Many debating societies that were founded at least as early as the mid-nineteenth century are still active today, though they have generally shifted their focus to intercollegiate competitive debate. In addition to Wake Forest, the debate society at Northwestern University dates to 1855. Boston College&#x27;s Fulton Debating Society, which was founded in 1868, continues to organize an annual &quot;Fulton Prize Debate&quot; between teams of its own students after the intercollegiate debate season has ended. Other universities continue similar traditions.

Intercollegiate debates have been held since at least as early as the 1890s. History records there were debates between teams from Wake Forest University and Trinity College (later Duke University) beginning in 1897. Additionally, a debate between students from Boston College and Georgetown University occurred on May 1, 1895, in Boston. Whitman College debated Washington State University, Willamette University, and the University of Idaho in the late 1890s. Southwestern claims that the first debate held on its campus was between Southwestern and Fairmount College (which eventually became Wichita State University) but that debate could not have occurred prior to 1895, the year Fairmount College began classes.

By the mid-1970s, regular rules for lengths of speeches developed. Each side (Affirmative and Negative) was afforded two opening &quot;constructive&quot; speeches, and two closing &quot;rebuttal&quot; speeches, for a total of eight speeches each debate round. Each speaker was cross-examined by their opponent for a period following his or her constructive speech. Traditionally rebuttals were half the length of constructives, but when a style of faster delivery speed became more standard in the late 1980s, that time management stricture was dropped. Wake Forest University introduced reformed speech times in both its college (9‚Äë6 instead of 10‚Äë5) and high school (8‚Äë5 instead of 8‚Äë4) tournaments, which spread rapidly to become the new de facto standards.

==Style and delivery==

===Speed===
Policy debaters&#x27; speed of delivery will vary from league to league and tournament to tournament. In more progressive and larger tournaments, debaters will speak very quickly - often called spreading - in order to read as much evidence and make as many arguments as possible within the time-constrained speech. Speed reading or spreading is normal at the majority of national circuit policy debate tournaments.

Some feel that the rapid-fire delivery makes debate harder to understand for the lay person. Many further claim that the increased speed encourages debaters to make several poor arguments, as opposed to a few high-quality ones. A slower style is preferred by those who want debates to be understandable to lay people and those who claim that the pedagogical purpose of the activity is to train rhetorical skills. In contrast, rapid delivery is encouraged by those who believe that increased quantity and diversity of arguments makes debates more educational. Proponents of the delivery style emphasize that spreading can help increase the quality of debates by enabling more nuanced viewpoints, rather than more general positions. Most debaters will vary their rate of delivery depending upon the judge&#x27;s preferences.

===Flowing===

Debaters have a specialized form of note taking, called &quot;flowing&quot;, to keep track of the arguments presented during a debate. Conventionally, a debater&#x27;s flow is divided into separate &quot;flows&quot; for each different macro-argument in the debate round (kritiks, disads, topicalities, case, etc.). There are multiple methods of flowing, but the most common style incorporates columns of arguments made in a given speech. The first constructive speech is flowed from the top of the sheet down in the first column, and the next constructive speech is flowed in the right column next to the first one. Each speech is flowed in separate columns, alternating Affirmative and Negative. Rebuttals are flowed the same.

Certain shorthands for commonly used words are used to keep up with the rapid rate of delivery. The abbreviations or stand-in symbols vary.

==Theory==
There are many accepted standards in policy debate, and there are several dominant speech argument styles. Sometimes debaters will debate about how policy debate should work. Those arguments are known as &quot;theory&quot; arguments, and they are most often brought up when one team believes the other team is unfair and therefore warrant a loss or other intervention by the judge. They are also brought up to change how an argument is weighted by the judge to either assist themselves or detract from the opponents. Theory debates in-round are not rare, but whole rounds are almost never about theory itself. Theory is argued as part of the decision of the round with the hope of advancing debate the activity and the principles of rhetoric, argumentation, policymaking, and so on that the debaters are engaged in the substantive matter of the topic.

===Burdens of the affirmative===
When the Affirmative team presents a plan, they take upon the Burden of the Policy to advocate (Justification) a significant change (Significance or Impact) to the status quo and that their plan should be adopted and hence, by default, the resolution that in general will allow for such a plan (Inherency). They must persuade that their plan is an example of the resolution (Topicality, Typicality), and they must prove that the plan is a good idea (Solvency). The Affirmative traditionally must uphold this burden as preferable to the status quo (Harms). 
Given that the affirmative must prove that they are preferable to the status quo (commonly referred to as the squo), the negative team always has presumption for winning the round. The negative is automatically the winner unless the affirmative can prove they are better than the status quo.

====Stock issues====

One traditional way to judge policy debate is to judge the Affirmative on four issues or burdens to meet, called the stock issues. The four stock issues are modeled after U.S. court procedural aspects of administrative law in deciding cases (as opposed to Constitutional controversies): ill (Harm), blame (Inherency), cure (Solvency), cost (Significance). They are generally known as follows:
* Harm Does the plan acknowledge a problem, a want, a need, of some policy interest implied or alluded to or of interest from the resolution?
* Inherency of the status quo: Is the plan an Intrinsic change? Also, is the plan necessary? What is the Status Quo? Is the affirmative&#x27;s plan happening already, and if not, why? Inherency promotes strength of originality in advocacy.
* Significance, or Impact upon the status quo: Does the plan warrant change? Does the plan warrant the resolution (Justification)?
What is the problem in the status quo to justify adopting the plan? Is the plan important enough to even warrant consideration or make a difference?
* Solvency advantages: Does the plan deal with the issues presented adequately?
Will the plan solve any problems in the status quo? How much of an impact (positive effect, or Significance) will the plan have?

==Advantages and disadvantages==

Most affirmative teams today generally frame their case around advantages, which are good effects of their plan. The negative team will often present disadvantages which contend that the affirmative plan causes undesirable consequences. In an attempt to make sure that their advantages/disadvantages outweigh those of the other team, debaters often present extreme scenarios such as the extinction of the human race or a global nuclear war.

===Negation tactic===
Negation Tactic, also known as Negation Theory, contends that the negative need only negate the affirmative instead of having to negate the resolution. The acceptance of all-inclusive negation, as opposed piecemeal, allows Negative teams to run full argumentation outlines such as topical counterplans with better Solvency that affirms the resolution but still negates the Affirmative&#x27;s plan.

===Negative strategy===
After the affirmative presents its case, the negative can down-vote the case with many different arguments, which include:
* Topicality: The Negative will attempt to argue that the Affirmative team does not fall under the rubric of the resolution and should be rejected immediately regardless of the merits or advantages of the plan. This is a type of &quot;meta-debate&quot; argument, as both sides then spend time defining various words or phrases in the resolution, laying down standards for why their definition(s) or interpretation(s) is superior. Most yearly topics have at least one or two commonly run Affirmative cases that are only arguably topical, so Topicality is often justified as a check or deterrent on and against such plans, which usually have quite strategic components. If run correctly, they are the strongest arguments against case only in unique circumstances. When topicality is run when the aff is clearly topical, which is common, it is usually used as a time waster for the aff.
* Disadvantages: The negative can claim that there are disadvantages, or adverse effects of the plan, which outweigh any advantages claimed. In order to outweigh any positive effects of the affirmative case, impacts must be arguably &quot;larger&quot; than those of the opposing team. The negative must say what is good now, and how the affirmative&#x27;s plan causes the impact of their disadvantage. A disadvantage is composed of a uniqueness (a description of the status quo in terms of the impacts of their disadvantage), a link (how the affirmative&#x27;s plan activates the impact), and an impact (the adverse effect).
* Counterplans: The negative can present a counter solution to the affirmative case&#x27;s problem which does not have to affirm the resolution (The negative does not have to be topical in making a counterplan). This is generally accompanied by on-case arguments that the affirmative&#x27;s plan does not solve, as well as disadvantages that link to the affirmative case but not the counterplan. Counterplans narrow down the on-case arguments to: advantages the counterplan can not borrow, the inherency, and the solvency. Upon the negative running a counterplan, most debates boil down to the solvency of the affirmative case, and the disadvantages. Counterplans must be competitive with the plan. That means that the counterplan must either be mutually exclusive with the affirmative (for example, one cannot both increase oil production (a hypothetical plan) and decrease oil production (a hypothetical counterplan) or be undesirable in conjunction with the plan (the negative must win that the inclusion of the plan would cause some form of harm that the counterplan alone would avoid). If a counterplan is dropped after the affirmative perms as advocacy, the affirmative gets to keep all of the additional solvency.
* Kritiks: The negative can claim that the affirmative is guilty of a certain mindset or assumption that should be grounds for rejection or a different mutually exclusive alternative to the Affirmative&#x27;s plan. Kritiks are sometimes a reason to reject the entire affirmative advocacy without evaluating its policy; other times, kritiks can be evaluated within the same strictures as the affirmative case as to who is hypocritical or irrelevant or prejudiced, etc. Examples of some areas of literature for kritiks include biopower, racism, centralized government, and anthropocentrism. Kritiks arose in the early 1990s, with the first kritiks based in deconstructionist philology about the ambiguity of the language used (diction) and were championed by debaters Shane Stafford and Bill Shanahan. A kritik is built with a link (how the affirmative activates the impacts), an impact (the impact of a kritik is slightly different to regular impacts. They are more similar to harms and the impacts are saying that the affirmative team prolongs these harms), and the alternative (a way to fix the impacts, often in a very extreme manner. An example would be destroying the entire American government to fix institutionalized racism).
* Theory: Sometimes the subject matter of the affirmative&#x27;s case will create uneven Grounds at the beginning. In these cases, the negative can object to the procedure or content of the affirmative case. These objections are part of a Grounds theory debate in that they try to delineate what has been disavailed from fouling Grounds in a debate round.

==Evidence==

Evidence in debates is organized into units called &quot;cards&quot; (because such evidence was originally printed on note cards, though the practice has long been replaced by digital storage). Cards are designed to condense an author&#x27;s argument so that debaters have an easy way to access the information. A card is composed of three parts: the argument or evidence summary, the evidence that supports the argument, and the citation. The argument part, sometimes called the &quot;tag(line)&quot;, is the debater&#x27;s summary of the argument presented in the body. A tag is usually only one or two sentences. The &quot;citation&quot; contains all relevant reference citation information (that is, the author, date of publication, journal, title, etc.). Although every card should contain a complete citation, only the author&#x27;s name and date of publication are typically spoken aloud in a speech. Some teams will also read the author&#x27;s qualifications if they wish to emphasize this information. Qualifications are only included in trying to increase the weight of your cards against your opponents&#x27;. The &quot;body&quot; is a fragment of the author&#x27;s original text. The length of a body can vary greatly‚Äîcards can be as short as a few sentences and as long as two or more pages. Most cards are between one and five paragraphs in length. The body of a card is often underlined or highlighted in order to eliminate unnecessary or redundant sentences when the card is read in a round. In a round, the tag is read first, followed by the citation and the body.

Often, especially on the national circuit, a debater will share any cards they plan to read with their opponents and the judge immediately before their speech. If cards are not shared before the speech, it is common for an opponent to collect and examine evidence even while a speech is still going on. This practice originated in part because cards are read at a rate faster than conversational speed. Taking the cards during the speech allows the opponent to question the author&#x27;s qualifications, the original context of the evidence, etc. in cross-examination. It is generally accepted whichever team is using preparation time has priority to read evidence read previously during a round by both teams. As a result, large amounts of evidence may change hands after the use of preparation time but before a speech. Most judges will not deduct from a team&#x27;s preparation time for time spent finding evidence which the other team has misplaced.

After a round, judges sometimes &quot;call for cards&quot; to examine evidence whose merit was contested during the round or whose weight was emphasized during rebuttals so that they can read the evidence for themselves. Although widespread, this practice is explicitly banned at some tournaments, most notably National Catholic Forensic League nationals, and some judges refuse to call for cards because they believe the practice constitutes &quot;doing work for debaters that should have been done during round&quot;. Judges may also call for evidence for the purpose of obtaining its citation information so that they can produce the evidence for their own school. Opponents and spectators are also generally allowed to collect citations in this manner, and some tournaments send scouts to rounds to facilitate the collection of cites for every team at the tournament, information which is sometimes published later.

==Judging==

A judge is an individual responsible for deciding the winner and loser of a policy round as well as assessing the merits of the speakers. Judges merit a good debate round and, ideally, avoid inserting their own personal beliefs that might cloud impartiality, however, total impartiality is impossible which has led to judges adopting a paradigm. Judges are sometimes coaches who help debate teams improve.

Some circuits see &quot;lay&quot; or inexperienced judges recruited from the community as an important part of the activity of a debate club. Debaters in these circuits should be able to adapt their presentations to individuals with no debate experience at all, as well as maintaining high standards of debate for judges who have themselves been debaters. A common saying is that debate is a game of judges/judge adaptation. This use of lay judges significantly alters delivery and argumentation, as the rapid-fire style and complex debate-theory arguments are frequently new to lay judges. For this reason, other circuits restrict policy debate judging to qualified judges, generally ex-debaters.

===Speaker points===
The judge is charged not only with selecting a winner, but also must allot points to each debater. &quot;Speaker points&quot; are numeric merit scores that the judge awards the debaters on their speaking skills. Speaker point schemes vary throughout local state and regional organizations particularly at the high school level. However, the method accepted by most national organizations such as the National Forensic League, Tournament of Champions, National Catholic Forensic League, Cross-Examination Debate Association, and National Debate Tournament, use values ranging from 1 to 30. In practice, within these organizations the standard variation is 26‚Äë29, where 26&#x27;s are given to extremely poor speakers, where a perfect score is considered incredibly rare and warranted only by an outstanding performance. Most tournaments accept half-point gradations, for example 28.5s, or even by tenths. Generally, speaker points are seen as secondary in importance to wins and losses, yet often correlate with a team&#x27;s win/loss rate. In other words, the judge usually awards the winning team cumulatively higher speaker points than the losing team. If the judge does not, the decision is considered a &quot;low-point win&quot;. Low-point wins simply mean that the team with better argumentation did not speak as well as their competitors, which is rare, because judges will vote for teams that speak better overall and award higher speaker points to teams who deliver a better debate. The difference can be stated as so, &quot;the low-point winning team are better debaters, and the high-point losing team provided a better debate round&quot;.

In some smaller jurisdictions, the judge ranks the speakers 1‚Äë4 instead of awarding them speaker points. Either speaker-point calculation may be used to break ties among teams with like records. Some areas also use speaker rankings in addition to speaker points in order to differentiate between speakers awarded the same number of points.

At a majority of tournaments, debaters also receive &quot;speaker awards&quot;, which are awarded to the debaters who received the greatest number of speaker points. Many tournaments also drop the highest and lowest score received by each debater, in order to ensure that the speaker award calculations are fair and consistent, despite the preferences of different judges. The number of speaker awards given out varies based on the number of debaters competing at any given tournament. For instance, a small local tournament might only award trophies or plaques to the top three debaters, whereas a widely attended &quot;national circuit&quot; tournament might give out awards to the top ten or fifteen speakers.

===Paradigms===
Most debate judges (who were usually debaters in high school and/or college) generally carry a mindset that favors certain arguments and styles over others. Depending on what mindset, or paradigm, the judge uses, the debate can be drastically different. Because there is no one view of debate agreed upon by everyone, many debaters question a judge about their paradigm and/or their feelings on specific arguments before the round.

Not every judge fits perfectly into one paradigm or another. A judge may say that they are &quot;tabula rasa&quot; or tab for short, or willing to listen to anything, but draw the line at arguments they consider to be offensive (such as arguments in favor of racism). Or, a judge might be a &quot;policymaker&quot;, but still look at the debate in an offense/defense framework like a games-playing judge.

Examples of paradigms include:
* Stock issues: In order for the affirmative team to win, their plan must retain all of the stock issues, which are Harms, Inherency, Solvency, Topicality, and Significance. For the negative to win, they only need to prove that the affirmative fails to meet one of the stock issues. These judges are more likely to dislike newer arguments such as critics and some theoretical points.
* Policymaker: At the end of the round, the judge compares the affirmative plan with either the negative counter-plan or the status quo. Whichever one is a better policy option is the winner. The better policy option is determined by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each.
* Tabula rasa: From the Latin for &quot;blank slate&quot;, the judge attempts to come into the round with no predispositions. These judges typically expect debaters to &quot;debate it out&quot;, which includes telling the judge what paradigm they should view the round in.
* Games player: Views debate as a game. Judges who use this paradigm tend to be concerned with whether or not each team has a fair chance at winning the debate. They usually view the debate flow as a game board, and look at arguments according to an offense/defense structure.
* Speaking skills/communications: This type of judge is concerned with good presentation and persuasion skills. They tend to vote for teams that are more articulate, and present arguments in the most appealing way. These judges usually disapprove of speed.
* Hypothesis tester: In order for the affirmative to win, they convince the judge to support the resolution. Conversely, the negative must convince the judge to negate the resolution.
* Kritikal: Judges who prefer kritik debates may look to who most effectively solves patriarchy, racism, orientalism, ocularcentrism, or other perceived oppressiveness.
* Stasis oratory: The judge gives the closure of the round. Judges who know stasis theory do not overexplain what it is and tend to be pedagogical, coaching debaters after the round to help improve debaters&#x27; appreciation of debate and oratory, by speaking on arguments and argumentation, strategy and tactics, rather than speaking on their personal judgment and analysis or judge&#x27;s paradigm. But these judges do judge and are not paradigm-based in their ballot voting.

==Competition==

===Tournaments===
Most high school debaters debate in local tournaments in their city, state or nearby states. Thousands of tournaments are held each year at high schools and certain colleges throughout the US.

A small subset of high school debaters, mostly from elite public and private schools, travel around the country to tournaments in what is called the &#x27;national circuit.&#x27; The championship of the national circuit is usually considered to be the Tournament of Champions, also called the TOC, at the University of Kentucky, which requires formal qualification in the form of two or more bids to the tournament. Bids are achieved by reaching a certain level of elimination rounds (for example, quarter-finals) at select, highly competitive, and carefully chosen tournaments across the country based upon the quality of debaters they attract and the diversity of locations from across the United States they represent. Debater partnerships with 2 bids are guaranteed a spot at the TOC, whereas debater teams with 1 bid (At-large teams) may be admitted if they consistently advance far in the elimination rounds or come close to winning a bid several other times.

===Urban debate===
Urban debate leagues give students in urban school districts an opportunity to participate in policy debate. There are currently urban debate leagues in 24 of the largest cities in the United States. In total, more than 500 high schools participate in the league and more than 40,000 students have competed in urban debate.

===Rural debate===
The Rural Debate Initiative (&quot;RuDI&quot;) expands access to debate to secondary school students residing in rural America. RuDI partners with top college programs to provide weekly coaching sessions, internal debate tournaments and summer debate camps to rural students in a virtual format at no cost. RuDI is organized by a five-member board, including Executive Grant Zhang, President Kelly Mu, Assistant Jared Shirts, Outreach Ambassador Ann Schulte, and Coach Joseph Smith. The RuDI also provides supplemental programs such as leadership development initiatives and career development workshops to champion and leverage the assets unique to rural communities and rural individuals, such as their pride of place, close-knittedness, and diverse set of practical skills.

===Championships===

====High school====

There is some dispute over what constitutes the &quot;national championship&quot; in the United States per se, but two tournaments generally compete for the title:
The Tournament of Champions held at the University of Kentucky, and the National Speech and Debate tournament sponsored by the National Forensic League (now known as the National Speech &amp; Debate Association). For the highest level of competition, the Tournament of Champions is generally considered to be the more prestigious title to hold.
* Other national championships include:
** The Grand National Tournament of the National Catholic Forensic League.
** The National Championship of the National Association of Urban Debate Leagues (NAUDL).
** The National Debate Coaches&#x27; Association Championship (NDCA)
** The National Christian Forensics and Communications Association (NCFCA)
** The National Invitational Tournament of Champions (NITOC) of Stoa USA
** The National Speech and Debate Association National Tournament (NSDA).

====Texas Forensic Association Debate====
In Texas, most debate occurs in Texas Forensic Association (TFA) tournaments. The other major debate organization is the University Interscholastic League (UIL).

====College====
There is no single unified national championship in college debate; though the National Debate Tournament (NDT), the Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA) and the American Debate Association (ADA) all host national tournaments. The NDT committee issues a ranking report of the top 16 teams in the country (&quot;first round bids&quot;) for automatic advancement to the NDT in early February. The report roughly determines a regular season champion called the &#x27;Copeland Award&#x27; for the team rated the highest over the course of the year through early February.

===Institutes and camps===

While once attended by only highly competitive policy debaters, many high school students now attend debate institutes, which are typically held at colleges in the summer. Most institutes range from about two to seven weeks, with four weeks being the most common.

Many institutes divide students into work groups, or &quot;labs&quot;, based on skill level and experience. Many even offer specialized &quot;advanced&quot; or &quot;scholars&quot; workshops, to which acceptance is highly limited.

These camps often set the tone for the upcoming season and produce much of the evidence used by debaters at the beginning of the year.

==Resolutions==
A resolution or topic is a statement which the affirmative team affirms and the negative team negates. Resolutions are selected annually by affiliated schools. Most resolutions from the 1920s to 2005 have begun &quot;Resolved: that The United States federal government should&quot; although some variations from that template have been used both before the NDT-CEDA merger and with the 2006‚Äì2007 college policy debate topic, which limited the affirmative agent to the United States Supreme Court.

At the college level, a number of topics are proposed and interested parties write &quot;topic papers&quot; discussing the pros and cons of that individual topic. Each school then gets one vote on the topic. The single topic area voted on then has a number of proposed topic wordings, one is chosen, and it is debated by affiliated students nationally for the entire season (standard academic school year).

At the high-school level, &quot;topic papers&quot; are also prepared but the voting procedure is different. Those papers are then presented to a topic selection committee which rewords each topic and eventually narrows down the number of topics to five topics. Then the five resolutions are put to a two-tiered voting system. State forensic associations, the National Forensic League, and the National Catholic Forensic League all vote on the five topics, narrowing it down to two. Then the two topics are again put to a vote, and one topic is selected.

<doc id="447493" wikidata="Q103084" url="?curid=447493" title="Flag of Burundi">
<text>The original national flag of [[Burundi]] (Kirundi: &quot;ibendera ry&#x27;Uburundi&quot;) was adopted after the country&#x27;s independence from Belgium on 1 July 1962. It went through several revisions and now consists of a white saltire which divides the field into alternating red and green areas. The center of the saltire merges into a white disk, on which there are three red solid six-pointed stars outlined in green. The current ratio is 3:5, which was changed from 2:3 on 27 September 1982.

== Symbolism ==

The flag is divided into four parts by a white saltire. The upper and lower parts are red in color, while the left and right ones are green in color. The white color of the saltire represents peace, green represents the nation&#x27;s hopes placed on future development, and red symbolizes the suffering of the nation during its freedom struggle. The three stars in triangular configuration stand for the three ethnic groups of Burundi: the Hutu, the Twa and the Tutsi. The three stars also stand for the three elements of the national motto: &quot;Ubumwe, Ibikorwa, Amajambere&quot; (&quot;Unity, Work and Progress&quot;), which can be seen on the coat of arms of Burundi. They also represent the loyalty that the citizens of the nation have pledged to their God, king and country.

== Colors ==
The colours are defined in the constitution as simply green, white, and red. Nowhere does the government document any specific colour shades.
For lack of any official standard, the colours used at the 2012 Olympics are shown in the table below.
== Construction sheet ==
== History ==
When the monarchy ruled over Burundi a variant flag featuring a &quot;karyenda&quot; (a drum said to have divine power) was used. It was believed that the drum&#x27;s messages could be understood only by the &quot;mwami&quot; (rulers) who made it the laws of the state. Following the abolition of the monarchy in November 1966, the &quot;karyenda&quot; was removed from the flag and the other flag was adopted soon after. The &quot;karyenda&quot; was replaced with a sorghum plant which is an important agricultural product of the country.

<doc id="447495" wikidata="Q2671446" url="?curid=447495" title="Sinulog">
<text>The Sinulog Festival (as known as Sinug and Sulog) is an annual cultural and religious festival held on the third Sunday of January in Cebu, with the center of the activities being in Cebu City, and is the centre of the Santo Ni√±o Christian celebrations in the Philippines.

The festival is widely regarded as one of the largest cultural and religious festivals in the Philippines, with every celebration of the festival which attracting estimated reach over 4 million attendees since 2025. Aside from the religious aspect of the festival, Sinulog is also famous for its street parties, usually happening the night before and the night of the main festival. The festival is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;Grandest Festival in the Philippines&#x27; by some participants and locals.

Other places in the Philippines also celebrate their own version of the festival in honor of the Santo Ni√±o, both within Cebu like Carmen, and outside Cebu, including Tondo, Kabankalan, General Santos, Maasin, Cagayan de Oro, Butuan, Pagadian, Balingasag, and Don Carlos, Bukidnon.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;Sinulog&quot; comes from the Cebuano adverb &quot;sulog,&quot; roughly means water current describing the forward-backward dance movements. The dance consists of two steps forward and one step backward, done to the sound of drums. The dance is categorized into Sinulog-base, free-interpretation, and street dancing. Candle vendors at the Basilica continue to perform the traditional version of the dance when lighting a candle for the customer, usually accompanied by songs sang in Cebuano.

Sinulog is the ritual prayer-dance honoring the Se√±or Santo Ni√±o or the Child Jesus. An image of the Child Jesus is said to be the baptismal gift Ferdinand Magellan gave to Hara Amihan (Humanay) of Zebu (now Cebu) in April 1521. The image, believed to be miraculous, is housed at the Basilica Minore del Santo Ni√±o in downtown Cebu City.

The Sinulog dance moves are often identified to be two steps forward and one step backward as the dancer sways to a distinct rhythm of drums. This movement is made to resemble the current (&quot;sulog&quot;) of what was known as Cebu&#x27;s Pahina River.

According to historical accounts, Cebuanos had already performed dances similar to the Sinulog to honor animist idols long before the introduction of Christianity to the Philippines, which arrived in Cebu with the arrival of Ferdinand Magellan who led a Spanish expedition on April 7, 1521. The original image of Santo Ni√±o was reportedly left by the Magellan expedition, and was rediscovered when the Spanish returned in 1565 during the expedition led by Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi, which played a significant role in the subsequent Spanish colonial period in the Philippines.

The Sinulog is observed as a celebration of the Filipino people&#x27;s embrace of Christianity, marking a significant moment in the country&#x27;s religious and cultural history, particularly in Cebu. The first of these conversions happened in 1521 on the island of Cebu, when Indianized-Sanskritized ruler Rajah Humabon and his queen Amihan (Humamay) were baptized along with their subjects, becoming Carlos and Juana of Cebu.

==History==

On March 16, 1521, Ferdinand Magellan arrived and planted the cross on the shores of Cebu, claiming the territory for Spain. He presented the image of the Child Jesus to the Rajah Humabon. Hara Humamay (or Amihan in some versions) was later named Queen Juana after Juana, mother of Charles I of Spain along with the rulers of the island and some 800 natives were also converted to the Christian faith.

Some Sinulog dances interpret the historical events surrounding the arrival of the Spaniards and the presentation of the Santo Ni√±o to Queen Juana, though various performances may emphasize different aspects of the festival&#x27;s history and significance. A popular theme among Sinulog dances is Queen Juana holding the Santo Ni√±o in her arms and using it to bless her people who were often afflicted with sickness believed to be caused by demons and other evil spirits.

The Sinulog dance steps are believed to originate from Rajah Humabon&#x27;s adviser, Baladhay. It was during Humabon&#x27;s grief when Baladhay fell sick. Humabon ordered his native tribe to bring Baladhay into a room where the Santo Ni√±o was enthroned, along with the other pagan gods of the native Cebuanos. After a few days passed, Baladhay was heard shouting and was found dancing with utmost alertness. Baladhay was questioned as to why he was awake and shouting. Pointing to the image of the Santo Ni√±o, Baladhay explained that he had found on top of him a small child trying to wake him and tickling him with the midrib of the coconut. Greatly astonished, he scared the child away by shouting. The little child got up and started making fun of Baladhay. In turn, Baladhay danced with the little child and explained that he was dancing the &quot;movements of the river.&quot; To this day, the two-steps forward, one-step backward movement is still used by Santo Ni√±o devotees who believe that it was the Santo Ni√±o&#x27;s choice to have Baladhay dance.

===Arrival of L√≥pez de Legazpi===

The expedition led by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi bombarded the native settlement when they arrived on April 28, 1565. In one of the burning huts, one of Legazpi&#x27;s men, Juan Camus, discovered the image of the Santo Ni√±o inside a wooden box beside other idols. When Legazpi arrived, he found that the natives performed dances, which were later associated with the honoring of the Santo Ni√±o. This moment, known as the &quot;Kaplag&quot;, would be spun off into a summer time festival in the 2020s.

The Augustinian friars that accompanied L√≥pez de Legazpi in his expedition built a church on the site where it was found. The church was called San Agustin Church, later renamed to Basilica Minore del Santo Ni√±o.

===Letter to the King of Spain===
After Juan Camus found the Santo Ni√±o in the burning village, L√≥pez de Legazpi was said to have included the incident in his report, entitled &quot;Relation of Voyage to the Philippine Islands&quot;:

:&quot;Your Excellency should know that on that day when we entered this village (Cebu City), one of the soldiers went into a large and well-built house of an indio where he found an image of the Child Jesus (whose Most Holy Name I pray may be universally worshipped). This was kept in its cradle, all gilded, just as if it were brought from Spain: and only the little cross, which is generally placed upon the globe in his hands, was lacking. The image was well kept in that house, and many flowers were found before it, and no one knows for what object or purpose. The soldier bowed down before it with all reverence and wonder, and brought the image to the place where the other soldiers were. I pray to the Holy Name of his image, which we found here, to help us and to grant us victory, in order that these lost people who are ignorant of the precious and rich treasure, which was in their possession, may come to knowledge to him.&quot;

===Today===

Since the 16th century, there has been great devotion to the Santo Ni√±o in Philippine popular piety, particularly in the Visayas. Pilgrims from different parts of Cebu and the rest of the Philippines make their yearly journey to the church to take part in the procession and festival. Starting in 1980, the Cebu City government organized the Sinulog Festival and eventually gave incentives also to tribal dance groups. The first Sinulog parade was held on January 20, 1980, organized by D√°vid Odilao, then Regional Director of the Ministry of Sports, and Youth Development, with the Sinulog conceptualized to be a &quot;true Cebuano festival&quot;, comparable to the Dinagyang of Iloilo and the Ati-atihan of Aklan, both of which also celebrate the feast of Sto. Ni√±o. The parade was composed of students dressed in Knitted Filipiniana costumes, dancing the Sinulog to the beating of drums.

The idea caught and thus, under the direction of then-Cebu City Mayor Florentino Solon with the help of several influential Cebuanos, Odilao turned over the Sinulog project to the Cebu City Historical Committee under Kagawad Jesus Garcia. It was the task of the committee to conceptualize the Sinulog festival and make it into a yearly event from then on.

In 1981, the concept of the Sinulog Parade was actualized involving not just Cebu but also representatives from other provinces in the Philippines. Marking its difference from another popular Visayan festival, the Ati-Atihan, the Sinulog focuses on both the ritual aspects and the historical context of the dance, which symbolizes the Philippines&#x27; embrace of Christianity.

In the 2000s and the early 2010s, law and order during the Sinulog celebration was an issue for years. Large street parties were celebrated throughout the city, notably along General Maxilom Avenue (also known as Mango Avenue) and the Baseline area along Juana Osme√±a Street. Some rowdy party-goers have run into trouble, and many have been found sleeping along the city&#x27;s streets due to intoxication. In 2016, street parties along the Sinulog carousel route were banned in an effort to control most of the disturbances caused by these street parties.

The Devotee City, a temporary accommodation place consisting of reused shipping containers, has also been launched since 1996 to accommodate devotees from far-flung areas who do not have any accommodation within Cebu City or other nearby areas. It is usually located in the open space surrounding the Compania Maritima building, and is only a few meters away from the Magellan&#x27;s Cross and the Basilica del Santo Ni√±o.

The festival was cancelled in 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and again in 2022 due to the devastation caused by Typhoon Rai to Cebu. Since 2023, the grand parade has been moved to the South Road Properties (SRP) instead of the Cebu City Sports Center (CCSC), its long time-home, by Cebu&#x27;s current mayor and the overall chairman of the Sinulog Foundation Incorporated (SFI), Michael Rama, largely against the interest and welfare of the Cebuanos. The &quot;Sinulog sa Kabataan&quot; &quot;sa Dakbayan&quot; and the &quot;Sinulog sa Lalawigan&quot;, which are qualifying events for the main Sinulog event, however, still remain at the CCSC. 

Two contingents have joined from other festivals in one national festival from MassKara Festival in Bacolod City and one international from South Korea. 

The festival, for the first time, had two major parades in 2024. The &quot;Sinulog sa Lalawigan&quot;, which was originally the preliminary competition &quot;Sinulog sa Kabataan sa Lalawigan&quot;, was transformed into a Sinulog parade for provincial contingents since they could not, once again, dance in SRP. The Sinulog sa Lalawigan was held in the CCSC, the old venue of Sinulog. The other contingents from Cebu City and out-of-town danced in the Sinulog parade on the 3rd Sunday of January in SRP. The backlash from the move from 2023 proved all too much that in August of 2024, Cebu City Acting Mayor Raymond Alvin Garcia, officially announced the return to the CCSC for the Sinulog festivities in 2025 in time for the 2025 Jubilee Year and the festival&#x27;s Sapphire Jubilee.

Cebuanos also celebrate the Sinulog worldwide in Filipino communities in other countries such as the &quot;Winter Sinulog&quot; (which is celebrated in January in cold countries) and &quot;Summer Sinulog&quot; (which is also celebrated in August) in Philadelphia from the United States. Sinulog has also been performed in international competitions in South Korea and the Philippine Independence Day Parade in New York City.

==Qualifying week==
Two traditional qualifying events at the Cebu City Sports Complex mark the week before the Sinulog festival day.

The city qualifying event, the &quot;Sinulog sa Kabataan sa Dakbayan&quot; (Sinulog for the Youth of the City), is the first qualifying event and is a competition exclusive to schools and community troupes from Cebu City. The second one, the &quot;Sinulog sa Lalawigan&quot; (Sinulog of the Province), is organized by the Cebu provincial government which is participated by school and cultural groups from all over Cebu province.

The champions of the two qualifying events advance to the main Sinulog grand parade and a number of competitors from both also are granted automatic bids for the same for their performance.

==Logo==

The Cebu City Historical Committee, which was responsible for the conceptualization of the Sinulog as a provincial event, decided to adopt a logo to identify it as an institutionalized yearly event. They turned to the coat of arms of the Santo Ni√±o which consisted of a two-headed hawk that was the mark of the ruling House of Habsburg in Europe. The emblem represented the twin purpose of the Habsburg dynasty as &quot;Champion of Catholicism and Defender of the Faith.&quot; At the time when Spain sent expeditions to the Philippines, they were under the Habsburg dynasty. The committee viewed using the image of the Santo Ni√±o as part of the symbol as sacrilege.

The Sinulog committee then incorporated the two-headed eagle to a native warrior&#x27;s shield. The native shield is supposed to symbolize the Philippine&#x27;s resistance to colonization while the Santo Ni√±o&#x27;s coat of arms printed on its face represents the country&#x27;s acceptance of Christianity.

<text>HMS &quot;Cardiff&quot; was a British Type 42 destroyer and the third ship of the Royal Navy to be named in honour of the Welsh capital city of Cardiff.

&quot;Cardiff&quot; served in the Falklands War, where she was involved in the 1982 British Army Gazelle friendly fire incident. She also shot down the last Argentine aircraft of the conflict and accepted the surrender of a 700-strong garrison in the settlement of Port Howard.

During the 1991 Gulf War, her Lynx helicopter sank two Iraqi minesweepers. She later participated in the build-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq as part of the Royal Navy&#x27;s constant Armilla patrol, but was not involved in the actual invasion.

&quot;Cardiff&quot; was decommissioned in July 2005, and sent for scrapping despite calls by former servicemen for her to be preserved as a museum ship and local tourist attraction in Cardiff.

== Construction ==

The Type 42 destroyers, also known as the &quot;Sheffield&quot; class, were built in three batches; &quot;Cardiff&quot; was built in the first. She cost over ¬£30¬†million, which was double her original quoted price. Her keel was laid down on 6 November 1972, at Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The build was interrupted by a labour shortage at Vickers. To solve this problem, she was towed to Swan Hunter Hawthorn Leslie yard in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear and completed there.

Type 42s were designed as anti-aircraft vessels primarily equipped with the Sea Dart, a surface-to-air missile system capable of hitting targets up to away. &quot;Cardiff&quot;‚Ä≥s secondary weapon system was a 4.5¬†inch Mark 8 naval gun, capable of firing shells to a range of . After the Falklands War, in which two Type 42s were sunk by enemy aircraft, the entire class was equipped with the Phalanx close-in weapon system, a Gatling cannon that could fire 3,000¬†rounds per minute and was designed to shoot down anti-ship missiles.

== Operational history ==

=== Early career ===

&quot;Cardiff&quot; was launched on 22 February 1974 by Lady Caroline Gilmour. Following fitting-out and sea trials, &quot;Cardiff&quot; commissioned on 24 September 1979 under command of Captain Barry Wilson. During the next 12¬†months of active service she steamed over and undertook various duties. She returned to her place of construction, Tyne and Wear, so that the Swan Hunter crew who fitted her out could exhibit the warship to their families. In the spirit of establishing a firm association, &quot;Cardiff&quot; visited her namesake city and welcomed more than 7,000¬†people on board. Her crew raised over ¬£1,000 for local charities by participating in sponsored bicycle rides and dinghy rows from Portsmouth and Newcastle upon Tyne. BBC Radio Wales based an entire programme on her and she appeared on the BBC and ITV national television channels. In November 1979, &quot;Cardiff&quot; coordinated the search for survivors of the , which sank off the Isle of Wight with the loss of most of her crew.

In 1980, she attended the annual Navy Days event at Portsmouth and Portland Harbour, receiving a total of 17,300¬†visitors. In October of the same year, she ventured abroad for the first time on a visit to Ghent, Belgium. She followed this with a fortnight of Sea Dart exercises on a range off Aberporth, in South Wales. Whilst in the region, the destroyer attended celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of Cardiff&#x27;s city status.

=== Falklands War (1982) ===

On 2 April 1982, the disputed British overseas territory of the Falkland Islands was invaded by neighbouring Argentina. The United Kingdom, nearly away, assembled and dispatched a naval task force of 28,000¬†troops to recapture the islands. The conflict ended that June with the surrender of the Argentine forces; the battles fought on land, at sea, and in the air had cost the lives of some 900 British and Argentine servicemen.

Just over a month before the start of the war, &quot;Cardiff&quot;, under the command of Captain Michael Harris, had begun a six-month deployment to the Persian Gulf with the Armilla Patrol. &quot;Cardiff&quot; had relieved her sister ship and class lead from this operational tasking, but was herself redeployed to the Falklands effort on 23 April. She sailed alone to Gibraltar and rendezvoused on 14 May with the Bristol group of British warships already heading south to the islands.

During the journey, &quot;Cardiff&quot;‚Ä≥s crew performed various training exercises, including defence against air attack (involving simulation runs by friendly Harrier and Jaguar aircraft), nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and Exocet anti-ship missiles. All British Type 42&#x27;s involved in the war were instructed to paint two vertical black stripes down either side the middle of their ships. This would allow the Royal Navy submarines to distinguish them from the two Argentine Type 42&#x27;s. On 22 May, an Argentine reconnaissance Boeing 707, no.¬†TC-92 of the Argentine Air Force&#x27;s (Spanish for &quot;2nd Air Transport Squadron, Group 1&quot;), was fired on by &quot;Cardiff&quot;. The aircraft was detected while shadowing the Bristol group, and &quot;Cardiff&quot; was ordered to drop back and engage. The ship fired two Sea Darts at the aircraft at 11:40 (local time) from maximum range; the first fell short and second missed due to evasive manoeuvres taken by the aircraft&#x27;s crew. After the attack, TC-92 dropped below radar level and returned to El Palomar. On 25 May, &quot;Cardiff&quot; was tasked with the recovery of four Special Air Service (SAS) troopers, who had parachuted from a C-130 Hercules passing over the destroyer.
The Bristol group met up with the main task force on 26 May. &quot;Cardiff&quot;‚Ä≥s arrival allowed the damaged to return to the United Kingdom for repairs. &quot;Cardiff&quot;‚Ä≥s primary role was to form part of the anti-aircraft warfare picket, protecting British ships from air attack and attempting to ambush Argentine aircraft that were re-supplying Port Stanley Airport. She was also required to fire at enemy positions on the islands with her 4.5-inch gun. In one engagement she fired 277¬†high-explosive rounds.

Shortly after arrival, she was involved in the final Exocet raid against the aircraft carrier . In the early hours of 6 June, &quot;Cardiff&quot; shot down a friendly Army Air Corps Gazelle helicopter (no.¬†XX377 of 656 Squadron), in the belief it was a low flying enemy C-130 Hercules. All four on board were killed, the factors contributing to the accident were a poor level of communication between the army and navy, and the helicopter&#x27;s &quot;Identification Friend or Foe&quot; transmitter had been turned off due to it interfering with other equipment. However a board of inquiry recommended that neither negligence nor blame should be attributed to any individual and that no action should be taken against any individual. The number &quot;205&quot; was later painted at the crash site () as a memorial, the significance being that two of the helicopter&#x27;s passengers were from 205¬†Signal Squadron. Approximately an hour after the shoot down, &quot;Cardiff&quot; spotted four landing craft carrying troops from the 2nd Battalion, Scots Guards. Having been told there were no other British forces in the area, &quot;Cardiff&#x27;s&quot; crew assumed they were Argentine, and fired illuminating star shells over them in preparation to attack. When the Guards saw the star shells and realised &quot;Cardiff&quot;‚Ä≥s intentions, the officer in charge of the landing craft, Major Ewen Southby-Tailyour, moved them to shallow water in an attempt to outrun her. &quot;Cardiff&quot;, still closing on the craft, signalled to them a single word &quot;friend&quot; via Aldis lamp, Southby-Tailyour responded with &quot;to which side&quot;. At this point &quot;Cardiff&quot; &quot;left them alone&quot;, neither attacking or assisting them, nevertheless another &quot;blue on blue&quot; incident was avoided.

On the morning of 13 June, two Argentine Dagger aircraft attacked &quot;Cardiff&quot;‚Ä≥s Lynx helicopter, no.¬†335 of 829¬†NAS, while it was searching in the Falkland Sound area. Poor weather had forced the Argentine craft to abandon their original mission of bombing Mount Longdon, and the third Dagger of their formation had suffered a mechanical failure and returned to base. The Lynx began evasive manoeuvres and dodged the attacks; the pilot, Lieutenant Christopher Clayton, was mentioned in despatches for his efforts.

Later that day, &quot;Cardiff&quot; shot down what would prove to be the last Argentine aircraft lost during the war, with a Sea Dart missile Canberra bomber B-108 of (&quot;Bombing Group 2&quot;) en route to bomb Port Harriet House. The pilot, Captain Pastr√°n, managed to eject but the navigator, Captain Casado, (whose ejection seat may have been damaged by the missile) was killed. The remains of Captain Casado were discovered in 1986, and identified by DNA testing in September 2008.

Argentina surrendered on 14 June, and &quot;Cardiff&quot; was required to accept the surrender of a 700-strong Argentine garrison in the settlement of Port Howard on West Falkland a day later. Five members of &quot;Cardiff&quot;‚Ä≥s crew were used to man a captured Argentine patrol boat, renamed , in Stanley. &quot;Cardiff&quot; spent the rest of June acting as the Landing Area Air Warfare Controller (LAAWC) around San Carlos.

Over the course of the war, &quot;Cardiff&quot; fired nine Sea Dart missiles and one Mk¬†46 torpedo. She returned to the United Kingdom on 28 July 1982, having left the Falklands three weeks earlier along with and . Captain Michael Harris handed over command on 24 August 1982, after the annual maintenance period. Following the war, all Type 42 destroyers were fitted with Oerlikon 30¬†mm twin cannons port and starboard, for protection against airborne threats. These were later replaced by the Phalanx close-in weapon system.

=== Gulf War (1990‚Äì91) ===

When Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990, British Secretary of State for Defence Tom King soon announced that the UK military contribution to the region was to be increased. A coalition of nations was formed, and a combined naval force entered the Persian Gulf and sailed north, neutralising the Iraqi Navy as it went, and then began conducting naval gunfire support and mine counter-measure missions in preparation for the main amphibious landing force.

Having returned from the Persian Gulf in May 1990, after only a few months in UK &quot;Cardiff&quot; sailed again, as a reinforcement to Group X-Ray, , and who had sailed to relieve Armilla Group Whiskey, which consisted of , and . &quot;Cardiff&quot; and were to form part of the air defence barrier along with , and protecting three United States aircraft carriers: , and . &quot;Cardiff&quot; had other responsibilities, including surface surveillance and boarding operations, to maintain the security around the task force.

Royal Navy Lynxes worked in combination with US Seahawks during the Gulf War. The American helicopters lacked an effective anti-ship missile, but had superior surveillance capability compared to the British Lynx. They would locate hostile boats for the British helicopters, which would then attack the target with its Sea Skua missiles. In total, Lynx helicopters flew nearly 600¬†sorties during the Gulf War, while their crews and engineers maintained flying rates three times their norm.

Despite her parent ship dodging mines and maintaining the air defence line as the closest non-US to Kuwait for the first 4 weeks of the 1991 War, &quot;Cardiff&quot;‚Ä≥s Lynx helicopter, no.¬†335 of 815¬†NAS, saw more of the combat in the Gulf War than &quot;Cardiff&quot; actually did. On 24 January 1991, no.¬†335 spotted Iraqi minesweepers and landing craft going to support the Iraqi land operations of the Battle of Khafji. 335 attacked and sank one - the first successful British naval engagement of the war. Later that day, Qaruh Island was captured by coalition forces, becoming the first Kuwaiti territory to be liberated. Overnight five days later (30‚Äì31 January 1991) with Lynxes from &quot;Gloucester&quot; and &quot;Brazen&quot;, no.¬†335 attacked at least two Iraqi missile firing fast patrol boats vessels exiting the Shatt Al Arab . &quot;Cardiff&quot; and 335 sank two more Iraqi ships in February. &quot;Cardiff&quot; and &quot;Brazen&quot; were relieved in mid February by Group Yankee, comprising , , and .

=== Post Gulf War ===

After the Gulf War, &quot;Cardiff&quot;‚Ä≥s assignments included a deployment with the Standing Naval Force Mediterranean, a post Cold War NATO immediate reaction force in the Mediterranean, and counter-narcotics patrols in the West Indies, during which she also assisted with relief tasks on the island of Eleuthera in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. From 1993 to 1994, she was commanded by Richard Leaman.

&quot;Cardiff&quot; later returned to the Persian Gulf for seven months.

On 14 October 1994, in response to renewed Iraqi deployment of troops near the Kuwaiti border, the US-led Operation Vigilant Warrior began. The operation was designed to deter Saddam Hussein&#x27;s &quot;&quot; by sending large amounts of allied military forces to Kuwait; and &quot;Cardiff&quot; were the UK contribution. The operation ended on 21 December 1994, when Hussein pulled back his forces.

Upon her return to the UK from Operation Vigilant Warrior, &quot;Cardiff&quot; participated in the 1995 NATO exercise &quot;Strong Resolve&quot;, a training exercise conducted every four years in dual crisis management. The ship next underwent Operational Sea Training (OST) at Portland, in preparation for assuming the duty of Fleet Ready Escort, which required a ship to be available to deploy anywhere in the world at short notice. After completing OST, she attended the 50th VE Day anniversary in Copenhagen and Oslo and provided navigational sea training for frigate and destroyer navigating officer candidates. A visit to her namesake city of Cardiff for VJ Day celebrations followed, after which she sailed to Plymouth for a trials and weapon training programme. She then took part in Operation Bright Star, a multi-national exercise conducted every two years in Egypt. In November, &quot;Cardiff&quot; became the first Royal Navy ship to enter the Lebanese capital of Beirut in 27¬†years, spurring the creation of the Beirut Phoenicians Rugby Club, followed by visits to Tunisia and Gibraltar.

In 2000, as part of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Atlantic Patrol Task North, &quot;Cardiff&quot; spent six months in the Caribbean with RFA &quot;Black Rover&quot;. They provided relief aid to the island of Caye Caulker, near Belize, in the wake of Hurricane Keith. In addition to clearing routes, distributing supplies, and making buildings and electrical cables safe, &quot;Cardiff&quot;‚Ä≥s surgeon and medical team monitored sanitation. In October, they also took part in the NATO exercise &quot;Unified Spirit&quot;, held off the east coast of the United States. &quot;Unified Spirit&quot; is a training exercise conducted every four years in NATO-led &quot;out-of-area&quot; UN peace support operations. In the same year she participated in the US Navy Fleet Battle Exercise after her combat system was integrated into the Digital Fires Network.

&quot;Cardiff&quot; conducted her last Armilla patrol in early 2003. During her time in the Persian Gulf, &quot;Cardiff&quot; prevented more than ¬£2¬†million of illegal cargo from being smuggled out of Iraq, inspected 178¬†vessels, and seized more than 25,000¬†tonnes of oil. The destroyer was relieved by before the beginning of the Iraq War and returned to Portsmouth on 4 April 2003. In late 2003, the ship was involved in the annual Sea Days demonstration exercise, and in October was used for tests of QinetiQ&#x27;s Maritime Tactical Network.

In 2005, she participated in the Trafalgar 200 International Fleet Review, just two weeks before she was decommissioned. In this post Gulf War period, the Royal Navy&#x27;s first female chaplain also served on board.

== Decommissioning and fate ==

&quot;Cardiff&quot; was originally to be replaced in 2009 by , the first of the Royal Navy&#x27;s next generation Type 45 destroyers. However, it was announced in July 2004 that she would be one of a number of ships withdrawn from service early, in accordance with the &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World&quot; white paper on the British military.

&quot;Cardiff&quot; was decommissioned on 14 July 2005, after making a final visit to her namesake city, where members of the public were allowed on board. She then stayed in Portsmouth Harbour at Fareham Creek () alongside sister ship , where both were heavily cannibalised to keep the remaining Type 42 Destroyers running.

On 21 November 2008, the two ships left Portsmouth for the last time for Aliaƒüa, Turkey under tow for scrapping. Following a decommissioning ceremony at Cardiff City Hall, her bell was removed and is now mounted in the north aisle of St John&#x27;s Parish Church in Cardiff. Calls were made for the conversion of the ship into a Cardiff tourist attraction by a Member of the National Assembly for Wales and former naval servicemen.

, a Type¬†45 destroyer, has been assigned as the current Royal Navy ship to be affiliated with the city of Cardiff.

On 1 March 2018, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson announced that the third Type 26 frigate would be named &quot;Cardiff&quot;. This will be the fourth Royal Navy vessel of its name.

<text>A flashcard or flash card is a card bearing information on both sides, usually intended to practice and/or aid memorization. It can be virtual (part of a flashcard software) or physical.

Typically, each flashcard bears a question or definition on one side and an answer or target term on the other. As such, flashcards are often used to memorize vocabulary, historical dates, formulae, or any subject matter that can be learned via a question-and-answer format. 

Flashcards are an application of the testing effect, the finding that long-term memory is increased when some part of an individual&#x27;s learning period is devoted to retrieving information through testing with proper feedback. Study habits affect the rate at which a flashcard user learns, and proper spacing of flashcards has been proven to accelerate learning.

== Format ==

=== Two-sided cards===
Physical flashcards are two-sided. They have a number of uses and can be simple or elaborate depending on the user&#x27;s needs and preferences. One may also use two parallel decks in tandem, such as an English-Japanese deck in conjunction with a Japanese-English deck. 

====Example====
An English-speaking student learning the Chinese word (r√©n, person or people) may write a card with the following sides.

Front:
:Q: person
:A: ‰∫∫, r√©n
Reverse:
:Q: ‰∫∫
:A: r√©n, person

===Three-sided cards===
Electronic flashcards may have a three-sided card. Such a card has three fields, Q, A, and A*, where Q &amp; A are reversed on flipping, but A* is always in the answer‚Äîthe two &quot;sides&quot; are thus Q/A,A* and A/Q,A*. These are most often used for learning foreign vocabulary, where the foreign pronunciation is not transparent from the foreign writing. In this case, the question (Q) is the native word, the answer (A) is the foreign word (written), and the pronunciation is always part of the answer (A*). This is particularly the case for character-based languages like Chinese hanzi and Japanese kanji, but it can also be used for other non-phonetic spellings such as English as a second language.

The purpose of three-sided cards is to provide the benefits of two-sided cards‚Äîease of authoring (enter data once to create two cards), synchronized updates (changes to one are reflected in the other), and spacing between opposite sides (so opposite sides of the same card are not tested too close together)‚Äîwithout the card needing to be symmetric. It is analogous to an arbitrary number of data fields associated with a single record, with each field representing a different aspect of a fact or bundle of facts.
== Psychology ==
Flashcards specifically exercise the mental process of active recall: given a question, one must produce the correct answer. However, many have raised several questions regarding optimal usage of flashcards: how does one precisely use them, how frequently does one review, and how does one react to errors, either complete failures to recall or partial mistakes? Various systems have been developed, mostly based around spaced repetition, the technique of increasing time intervals between reviews whenever a card is recalled correctly.

=== Spaced repetition ===
Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique which incorporates increasing time intervals between each review of a flashcard in order to harness the spacing effect. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, whereas older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently. The use of spaced repetition has been shown to generally increase one&#x27;s rate of learning. Although the principle is useful in many contexts, spaced repetition is commonly applied in contexts in which a learner must memorize a large number of items and retain them in long-term memory. It is therefore often used in vocabulary acquisition amidst second language learning. Additionally, spaced repetition software has been developed to aid the learning process through a virtual format as opposed to merely a physical one.

==== Leitner system ====

The Leitner system is a widely used method of efficiently using flashcards. Originally proposed by the German science journalist Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s, it is a simple implementation of the principle of spaced repetition where cards are reviewed at increasing intervals.

In this method, flashcards are sorted into groups according to how well the learner knows each one in the Leitner&#x27;s learning box. The learners then try to recall the solution written on a flashcard. If they succeed, they send the card to the next group. If they fail, they send it back to the first group. Each succeeding group has a longer period of time before the learner is required to revisit the cards. In Leitner&#x27;s original method published in his book &quot;So lernt man Lernen&quot; (&quot;How to learn to learn&quot;), the schedule of repetition was governed by the size of the five partitions in the learning box, which were 1, 2, 5, 8, and 14 centimeters, respectively. The learner only reviewed some of the cards in a section whenever it became full, subsequently moving them forward or backward depending on whether they remembered them.

====Software====
There is a wide range of software, including open source and online services, available for creating and using virtual flashcards as a learning aid.

==History==
Paper flashcards have been used since at least the 19th century. &quot;Reading Disentangled&quot; (1834), a set of phonics flashcards by English educator Favell Lee Mortimer, is believed by some to be the first known usage of flashcards. A single-sided hornbook was also known to have been used for early literacy education.

The Leitner system for scheduling flashcards was introduced by German scientific journalist Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s with his book, &quot;So lernt man lernen.&quot; Later, the SuperMemo program and algorithm (specifically the SM-2 algorithm, which is the most popular in other programs) was introduced in 1987 by Polish researcher Piotr Wo≈∫niak.

<text>The Presidents&#x27; Conference Committee (PCC) is a streetcar design that was first built in the United States in the 1930s. The design proved successful domestically, and after World War II it was licensed for use elsewhere in the world where PCC based cars were made. The PCC car has proved to be a long-lasting icon of streetcar design, and many remain in service around the world.
==Origins==
The Presidents&#x27; Conference Committee (PCC) originated from the design committee formed in 1929. It was renamed the &quot;Electric Railway Presidents&#x27; Conference Committee&quot; (ERPCC) in 1931. The group&#x27;s membership consisted primarily of representatives of several large operators of U.S. urban electric street railways plus potential manufacturers. Three interurban lines and at least one &quot;heavy rail&quot;, or rapid transit, operator‚ÄîChicago Rapid Transit Company‚Äîwere represented as well. Also included on the membership roll were manufacturers of surface cars (streetcars) and interested component suppliers.

ERPCC&#x27;s goal was to design a streamlined, comfortable, quiet, and fast accelerating and braking streetcar that would be operated by a seated operator using floor-mounted pedal controls to better meet the needs of the street railways and appeal to riders. ERPCC prepared a detailed research plan, conducted extensive research on streetcar design, built and tested components, made necessary modifications and revisions based upon the findings, and ultimately produced a set of specifications for a standardized and fixed design. It included a modest list of available options with ample room for customer customization but was to be built with standard parts as opposed to a custom designed car body with diverse parts added depending on the whims and requirements of the individual customer. Numerous national and international users operated large fleets of PCC cars for many years.

Many design patents resulted from the work of ERPCC. These were transferred to a new business entity called the Transit Research Corporation (TRC) when ERPCC expired in 1936. Although this company continued the work of research on improvements to the basic design of the car and issued sets of specifications three times in the ensuing years, because TRC defined a PCC car as any vehicle which used patents on which it collected royalties, it was formed for the primary purpose of controlling those patents and promoting the standardization envisioned by the ERPCC. The company was funded by its collection of patent royalties from the railways which bought PCC cars. The company was controlled by a voting trust representing the properties which had invested in the work of ERPCC. One participant in Committee meetings, Philadelphia trolley manufacturer J.G. Brill Company, brought a competitive design‚Äîthe Brilliner‚Äîto market in 1938. Because Raymond Loewy designed elements that were very similar to the PCC look, the Brilliner attracted no large orders, being built only for Atlantic City Transit and the Red Arrow Lines in suburban Philadelphia. Fewer than 50 were sold.

A significant contribution to the PCC design was noise reduction with extensive use of rubber in springs and other components to prevent rattle, vibration, and thus noise and to provide a level of comfort unknown before. Wheel tires were mounted between rubber sandwiches and were electrically isolated so that shunts were required to complete a ground. Resilient wheels were used on most PCC cars, with later heftier versions known as &quot;Super-Resilient&quot;.

Gears were another source of considerable noise, solved by employing hypoid gears which are mounted at a right angle to the axle, where three of the six teeth constantly engaged the main gear, reducing lash and noise. All movable truck parts employed rubber for noise reduction as well. &quot;Satisfactory Cushion Wheel of Vital Importance; Develop New Truck Design; Generous Use of Rubber&quot; are headings within a paper that Chief Engineer Clarence F. Hirshfeld both presented and published.

After a specification document suitable for purchasing cars was generated by TRC, orders were placed by eight companies in 1935 and 1936. First was Brooklyn &amp; Queens Transit Corporation (B&amp;QT) for 100 cars, then Baltimore Transit Co. (BTCo) for 27 cars, Chicago Surface Lines (CSL) for 83 cars, Pittsburgh Railways Co. (PRCO) for 101 cars, San Diego Electric Railway (SDERy) for 25 cars, Los Angeles Railway (LARy) for 60 cars, and then Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) for one car. In late 1935 or early in 1936 Westinghouse Electric Corporation pressed for one car to be equipped with their electrical equipment for testing in Pittsburgh, since the Brooklyn order would have all cars equipped by General Electric, and Clark Equipment Company pressed for one car to be made by them of aluminum for delivery to B&amp;QT. Agreements among the parties were reached whereby St Louis Car Company would build 101 essentially identical cars and Clark would build one of its own body design.

Brooklyn received its first car number 1001 on May 28, 1936, PRCo took delivery of car number 100 on July 26, 1936, and Baltimore received its first car on September 2, 1936. In the late 1936 discussions of operating experience, it was noted that the Brooklyn car had run 3,000 miles by the time the Pittsburgh car had run 1,000 miles. One of the key patents was filed by Dan H. Bell on January 8, 1937, and granted on July 5, 1938, and entitled, &quot;Rail Car or Similar Article,&quot; Patent No. 110,384. The first car to be placed in a scheduled public service was PRCo 100 in August and B&amp;QT launched its first scheduled service with a group of cars on October 1, 1936, followed by CSL on November 13, 1936. Production continued in North America by St. Louis Car Co. and Pullman Standard until 1952, with 4,978 units being built. Under license to use the designs patented by TRC, thousands more PCC and partially PCC type cars were produced in Europe through the last half of the 20th century. The cars were well built, and many hundreds are still in operation. The majority of large North American streetcar systems surviving after 1935 purchased PCC streetcars. The systems which eventually terminated streetcar operations often sold their cars to surviving operators.

The Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB) in Australia was keen to build two new tram routes after World War II, and these routes would be served by PCC Streetcars. The MMTB decided that it was too expensive and Melbourne only ever had two PCC streetcars, of which one was a prototype for a completely different class.

Several dozen remain in public transit service, such as on the Mattapan Line in Boston, as well as in Philadelphia, Kenosha, San Diego and San Francisco following extensive overhauling. All other surviving and functional North American PCC cars are operated by museums and heritage railways. Several retired PCCs from Boston, Cleveland, and Philadelphia were purchased as scrap and have been privately stored just outside Windber, Pennsylvania since 1992.

The PCCs built for Washington, D.C. were among the more unique examples due to the installation of overhead wires being prohibited within the city limits, necessitating the use of conduit plows that collected current using a plow lowered into a slot between the rails contacting positive and negative rails under the street. A pit was located at the boundary line of the city limits, over which cars would stop to have their power collection changed from the trolley pole to the conduit plow and vice versa.

&quot;The PCC car was not just another modular vehicle but the result of the only systems engineering approach to mass producing a rail car.&quot; Research into passenger comfort resulting from vibrations, acceleration, lighting, heating and cooling, seat spacing, cushion height, space for arms, legs, standing passengers, economies of weight affecting maintenance, cost of power, reduced wear of components and track. Dimensions were established to fit the majority but could easily be changed for special situations. Windows were spaced to match seating.

While some of the components in the PCC car had been used before‚Äîresilient wheels, magnetic braking, sealed gears, and modular design to name a few‚Äîthe ERPCC redesigned, refined, and perfected many of these while developing new acceleration and braking controls and put them all in one package.

==Manufacturing==


PCC cars were initially built in the United States by the St Louis Car Company (SLCCo) and Pullman Standard. Clark Equipment built the only aluminum-body PCC as well as all narrow gauge B1 trucks for Los Angeles, all the standard and broad gauge B2 trucks both air- and all-electric, and the B2B trucks used under PRCo 1725‚Äì1799 and Toronto 4500‚Äì4549. SLCCo built all B3 trucks, both standard and broad gauge. PCC cars for Canadian cities were assembled in Montreal, Quebec by Canadian Car &amp; Foundry from bodies and trucks supplied by St. Louis Car.

Westinghouse (Westinghouse Electric, Westinghouse Air Brake Company, Canadian Westinghouse Co.) and General Electric both supplied electrical packages and brake components which were designed and built in cooperation with the ERPCC. The customer specified the equipment, which was to be installed, performance was similar, and most cities ordered from both suppliers. Since Westinghouse was home based near Pittsburgh, PRCo ordered 75% of its PCC fleet with Westinghouse equipment, the balance with GE. Indeed, PCCs are often identified as either Westinghouse or GE.

The last PCC streetcars built for any North American system were a batch of 25 for the San Francisco Municipal Railway, manufactured by St. Louis and delivered in 1951‚Äì2.

A total of 4,586 PCC cars were purchased by United States transit companies: 1,057 by Pullman Standard and 3,534 by St. Louis. Most transit companies purchased one type, but Chicago, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Shaker Heights ordered from both. The Baltimore Transit Co. (BTC) considered the Pullman cars of superior construction and easier to work on. The St. Louis cars had a more aesthetically pleasing design with a more rounded front and rear, compound-curved skirt cut-outs, and other design frills.

===Performance===
When a wire is placed in a magnetic field and an electric current is passed through it, the wire will move. If this wire is wrapped on a spool and placed in a magnetic field with an electric current passed through it, the spool (rotor) will rotate, creating an electric motor. If the strength of the magnetic field or the amount of current running through the motor is increased (or both), the motor&#x27;s speed will increase. With a trolley, the speed is controlled by several resistors placed in the wire running to the rotor. Removing circuit resistors one at a time will increase the current in the motor&#x27;s magnetic field and this will increase the motor&#x27;s speed. Prior streetcar speed control from the 1880s required a standing operator at a four-foot-high vertical controller &quot;stand&quot; to rotate a handle to one of ten electrical resistance points within the stand to provide trolley acceleration. The resistors were not very large and were mounted adjacent to one another along the outside frame bottom of the trolley to provide cooling as they would get very hot. For the PCC however, there were more than ten resistance/speed points; Westinghouse developed the XD-323 underfloor rotary accelerator for the PCC&#x27;s motor control with 99 resistance points. It was installed in the first Pittsburgh car, number 100, and minor modifications allowed use in the last PCCs produced in North America for San Francisco in 1952.

The sitting PCC operator had a foot accelerator on the floor, much like that of an automobile, with linkage to underfloor resistance ribbons mounted in a circle. An arm rotating in the circle center had rollers on either end which cut out field resistance to increase speed as it was rotated a total of approximately 180 degrees rotation. This same accelerator also was used for dynamic braking; when the accelerator pedal was released, the resistance wheel sought optimum braking for the speed, which prevented a lag when the brake pedal was depressed. Westinghouse&#x27;s design was remarkable and innovative in that it allowed motor control by floor pedal similar to that of an automobile. General Electric also developed a control system for PCC cars that mirrored the Westinghouse scheme in function although not in simplicity or maintainability. With the GE commutator motor controller operating by air pressure, it had to be redesigned with the advent of the All-Electric PCC. Acceleration was variable between depending upon the depression of the power pedal with the accelerator advanced automatically by a low-voltage pilot motor. Service braking was also variable and the maximum dynamic application decreased speed by ; pressing the brake pedal into emergency also brought the friction and magnetic brakes into play providing a maximum deceleration of . Compared to a maximum of 14 points on older equipment, the PCC was considerably smoother.

Most PCCs employed three pedals with a dead man&#x27;s switch to the left, brake in center, and power pedal on the right. Depressing the brake about half-way and then releasing the deadman pedal put the PCC in &quot;park&quot;. Lifting the deadman alone would apply all brakes, drop sand, and balance the doors so they could be pushed open easily. Chicago used &quot;bicycle-type levers&quot; for power and brake but converted some cars to two pedals. St. Louis Public Service Co. (SLPS) used two pedals, both with heel interlocks. The right pedal is the brake; depressing this pedal about halfway while lifting away from the heel applied &quot;park&quot;. Once the brake is released the heel need not be engaged with the interlock (although a professional driver is to cover the brake at all times). The left pedal applied the power and the heel interlock had to be engaged at all times since it was the deadman; only when the brake was in &quot;park&quot; could the deadman be disengaged.

St. Louis is unique in that all 300 of their PCCs are All-Electric with the 1500s ordered in late 1939, the 1600s ordered late 1940s and the 1700s in January 1945. SLPS was the rolling laboratory for All-Electrics and what was learned here was applied to the post-WW2 All-Electric demonstrator in the fall of 1945.

From 1936 to 1945, PCC cars were &quot;Air-Electrics&quot; with friction brakes, doors, and windshield wipers operated by air pressure. PRCo PCC 1600 of 1945 was the post WW2 All-Electric Demonstrator which eliminated the air compressor and associated piping while incorporating such features as standee windows, a sloped windshield to eliminate nighttime glare, redesigned back end, forced-air ventilation, and other features. Dynamic brakes were the service brake on all PCCs; when almost stopped, friction brakes completed the stop and held the car in &quot;park&quot;. Dynamic brakes slowed the &quot;Air&quot; cars to at which point a lock-out relay allowed automatic application of air-applied friction brakes against each of the eight wheels. On All-Electric cars the dynamics were effective to where the lockout relay then allowed a spring-applied friction brake to engage a drum on each of the four motor drive shafts; this completed the stop and held the car in park. Drum brakes were released by an electric solenoid operating from low-voltage battery power; a power failure would prevent the drums from releasing which would prevent power application, a fail-safe feature. Drum brakes were quite popular and greatly reduced maintenance thus some &quot;Air&quot; cars were retrofitted with drums. Four magnetic brakes, one between the wheels on each side of each truck, applied additional braking for emergency stopping where all brakes were generally employed.

&quot;These performances [acceleration and braking] enable the P.C.C. car to out-pace the average automobile which, in America, is of substantially higher performance than the typical British vehicle.&quot; This, however, is only true when compared to the automobiles of that period.

The system of acceleration and braking described above means that the original PCC cars were (when in movement) always either accelerating or braking. A later improvement on the Brussels trams (built at that time under license by La Brugeoise et Nivelles and ACEC, now both subsidiaries of Bombardier Transportation, itself a subsidiary of the French Alstom) allowed the trams to coast under their accumulated kinetic energy.

===Body variations===

Two main body standards were made ‚Äì 1936 and 1945, sometimes called pre-and post-war ‚Äì the most prominent difference being the windows.

The pre-war cars usually had a right side arrangement of front door, five windows, center door, five windows, and one large rear quarter window. These cars were long and wide. There were variations, Washington, D.C. ordered shorter cars, at , with one less window, while Chicago ordered longer and wider cars, at by , with a three-door arrangement. Chicago cars were built with the centerline of the carbody to the right of the centerline of the tracks, so the widened cars could pass on the existing trackage.

Post war cars had a rationalized window arrangement. The windows and pillars were narrower, and there were small &quot;standee&quot; windows above each window. Right side arrangement usually was front door, seven windows, side door, four windows, and two rear quarter windows. Most post-war cars had a length of . Other body differences were a recessed windshield and wider doors. There were far fewer variations of this style, width being the most common.

Most double ended cars, at long by wide, were larger than standard, with different door arrangements. Only Dallas ordered standard size double ended cars. All double ended cars retained the pre-war style body until the end of production.

==Rapid transit cars==
There were four rapid transit companies on the committee, but the primary focus was streetcars, rapid transit development was slower. The difference in operations between the systems also made standardization difficult.

By 1940, Brooklyn had five three-section articulated trainsets with PCC components, after WWII Chicago ordered four similar trainsets. Chicago ordered two from Pullman and two from St. Louis, with different equipment, so that competing manufacturers could be directly compared. Experience from the trainsets influenced the following car standards.

Cars were to be approximately long (the Chicago maximum, Boston had some long) with one cab per car arranged in &quot;married&quot; two car sets, a double ended single car variant was possible. Number and type of doors and windows, interior layout, and width of cars varied with each system. Boston had two sizes, the longest at , and narrowest at , Cleveland had the widest at .

Trucks were a major focus, both Clark and St. Louis developed trucks with wheels and a maximum speed, but only Boston used them, Clark B10s on 40 cars. Chicago used streetcar type trucks, with wheels and a speed of , adequate for their system. When Clark stopped building railroad equipment in 1952 PCC trucks were no longer available, Boston and Cleveland then used non PCC trucks with wheels.

Chicago ordered the first of 770 (720 + 50 double-ended) 6000-series cars in 1948 (before the standard, which they influenced), Boston (40, then later 100) in 1950, and Cleveland (70 + 18 double-ended) in 1952. Chicago&#x27;s first 200 cars were entirely new, but in 1953 they started using components salvaged from new, but no longer needed, streetcars. Toronto, on the committee, initially considered buying the cars, but increased metal prices due to the Korean War made them prohibitively costly. Brooklyn, who had bought the first five prototype trainsets, also did not buy any production trainsets.

240 PCC rapid transit cars were built in four years, from 1948 to 1952, then 438 cars with non-PCC trucks until 1957, the last of Chicago&#x27;s 570 cars built with salvaged components were delivered in 1958. Some Chicago cars were in regular service in 1990, car number 30 made its last revenue run in 1999.

==PCC fleets==
===Historical===
The operator listed is the original purchaser.

===Current===
Most PCC-based systems were dismantled in the post-war period in favor of bus-based transit networks. Of the rail transit systems that survived this period, most had replaced their PCCs with modern light rail vehicles (LRVs) by the early 1980s. Beginning in the late 1990s, several cities began to make use of historic PCCs to serve historic streetcar lines that combined aspects of tourist attractions and transit. This table lists the transit agencies that still employ PCCs in revenue service, as opposed to a short-run or intermittent heritage railway.
The Mattapan Line in Boston is a light-rail extension of the MBTA&#x27;s heavy Red Line. It runs from the Ashmont terminus of the Red Line to Mattapan, and runs PCCs exclusively. The line was shut down for reconstruction from June 24, 2006, until December 22, 2007, but PCC cars have resumed operation since the line&#x27;s bridges cannot support heavier light rail vehicles (LRV) operated on the MBTA&#x27;s Green Line. Not considered historic equipment, the PCC cars in use on the Mattapan‚ÄìAshmont line represent the oldest cars still in revenue service, originally built between 1943 and 1946. These cars are also the only air-electric PCCs still in regular service in North America. Several retired PCCs from Boston are now at the Seashore Trolley Museum.
The McKinney Avenue Transit Authority in Dallas, Texas, owns three PCC cars, two from Toronto, one from the former Tandy Center Subway. One of the ex Toronto cars is currently in service.
Officials in El Paso expressed their desire to preserve the history of the city by refurbishing the old PCC streetcars that once made their way through Downtown from 1949 to 1974. They operated on the international streetcar line that connected El Paso, Texas in the United States, with Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico. Originally, the line operated until 1973. Six cars in total have been restored, regular revenue operations began in late 2018 for the downtown loop.

The Kenosha Electric Streetcar in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has been operating six ex-Toronto Transit Commission PCCs (five since 2000 and the sixth since 2009) and one ex-SEPTA car since 2009. The Kenosha Electric is unique among modern PCC operations in that PCCs had not run in the city before 2000‚Äîthe original rail system was shut down in 1932 before any PCC cars had been built. Two of its cars are still painted in their original TTC colours, while the rest have been re-decorated in the liveries of several U.S. cities including Pittsburgh, Johnstown, Chicago and Cincinnati.
SEPTA restored trolley service to the Route 15 Girard Avenue line in Philadelphia in September 2005 after a 15-year &quot;temporary&quot; suspension of trolley service in favor of diesel buses. The line uses restored and modernized (by the Brookville Manufacturing Company) PCC cars, known as PCC-IIs (now upgraded as PCC-IIIs), painted in their original green and cream Philadelphia Transit Company livery, rather than SEPTA&#x27;s white with red and blue stripes. Modernization included all-new control systems, modern turn markers, HVAC system (which accounts for the noticeably larger roof enclosure), and ADA compliant wheelchair lifts. The line runs from Haddington to Port Richmond down the median of Girard Avenue. It crosses both the Broad Street Subway and the Market‚ÄìFrankford Line, and stops at the Philadelphia Zoo, among other landmarks. SEPTA had originally planned to run modern Kawasaki trolleys along the line once service was restored, but a combination of economics and a desire to help revive the Girard Avenue corridor with a more &quot;romantic&quot; vehicle led to the agency restoring the old vehicles for about half the cost of new cars. SEPTA uses Kawasaki vehicles on the rest of its trolley lines, including the Subway-Surface Green Line linking West Philadelphia with Center City and its 69th Street Transportation Center with the western suburbs of Media and Sharon Hill via light rail routes 101 and 102.
San Diego Trolley currently uses 2 PCCs and is in the process of determining viability of a third car as of 2016. They are in use on the Silver Line which opened in 2011 and runs in a clockwise loop around Downtown San Diego.

The F Market Line (historic streetcar service) in San Francisco, opened in 1995, runs along Market Street from The Castro to the Ferry Building, then along the Embarcadero north and west to Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf. This line is run by a mixture of PCC cars built between 1946 and 1952, and earlier pre-PCC cars. Due to its success, a second heritage line was inaugurated in 2015, the E Embarcadero, which serves to facilitate a one-seat ride from the Caltrain San Francisco station to Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf. Although San Francisco had removed PCCs from revenue service when the city&#x27;s light rail was transformed into the Muni Metro system in 1980, they had made occasional festival trips in the ensuing years before being returned to full-time service. Car 1074 is painted in Toronto Transit Commission livery, but was never owned by the TTC. 
The first PCC cars in Canada were operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) in 1938. By 1954, Toronto had the largest PCC fleet in the world, including many purchased second-hand from U.S. cities that abandoned streetcar service following the Second World War. Although it acquired new custom-designed streetcars in the late 1970s and 1980s (and which was replaced by modern LRVs by Dec. 2019), the TTC continued using PCCs in regular service until 1995, and retains two (numbers 4500 and 4549) for charter purposes.
==Models based on the PCC streetcar==
The PCC license was used worldwide after World War II had ended which resulted in adaptations based on the American PCC design. Two such licensees were successful, namely the Belgian company La Brugeoise et Nivelles (since 1988 a subsidiary of Bombardier Transportation, itself since 2021 a subsidiary of the French Alstom), who built both standard-gauge and meter-gauge cars based on the PCC license for many networks in Belgium, France and the Netherlands; and particularly the Czech ƒåKD Tatra, who built the largest number of the PCC type in the world, supplying a number of Central and Eastern European countries. Trams such as the Tatra T3 and its variant Tatra T4, together the most numerous of any tram model ever produced, are still in service today in many of the regions where they were first introduced. Modern variants of the Tatra T3 are still produced today by some manufacturers, such as KOS Krnov. The Polish Konstal 13N was not built under license. Only models with direct references to the original American PCC streetcar are included here. Later models of a particular series such as the Tatra T5 were adapted and modernized further. 
Note that the country listed &quot;only&quot; covers areas where the cars were initially delivered; references for these areas can be found in the text.

The first PCC cars in Brussels (series 7000‚Äì7100) were built in prevision of the Expo 58: they were single-body non-reversible two-bogie cars. Articulated trams arrived since 1965: first two-body non-reversible trams (series 7500) then two-body (series 7700‚Äì7800) and three-body (series 7900) reversible ones, the last one delivered in 1978. The last single-body PCC tram in commercial service in Brussels ran in February 2010. All series 7500 trams were converted to series 7700 by addition of a second steering post except the 7500 prototype which was versed to the collection of the Brussels Tram Museum. Two-body and three-body reversible PCC trams are still in regular service next to more modern low-floor trams. All these articulated PCC cars use Jacobs bogies under the articulations (see example at right).

Brussels tramways use standard gauge (1.435 m); metre-gauge PCC trams are in use in Ghent and Antwerp.
The only PCC in West Germany was delivered from La Brugeoise to Hamburg in 1951. The car was sold to Brussels in 1957. Returned to Hamburg in 1995, where it was used as a historical tram in the VVM Sch√∂nberger Strand museum. In 1999, the tram was sold to the Danish tram museum of Skjolden√¶sholm.
These trams were used in Poland from 1959 to their retirement in 2012. Several remain as maintenance cars, while others have been preserved in museums. Konstal 13Ns were not produced under a PCC licence.
One set of PCC bogies and control equipment was imported into Melbourne circa 1949 and fitted to a modified W class body. Additional cars were planned, but never built. The single car was numbered 980, and was withdrawn from service in 1971. Z Class tram prototype car 1041 was built in 1972 using bogies salvaged from 980.
Only two of the planned 300 of the PCC A28 type trams had been delivered to Stockholm by ASJ in 1953. This was probably due to the withdrawal of the Polish side of the contract in 1946, which primarily stated the delivery not only of the tram wagons, but also 8 locomotives and 44 electric passenger trains by the ASEA company. The only ones that were built, based on bogies and the electrical system delivered from the USA. They were the first PCCs in Europe equipped with multiple-unit electrical systems and were only used in pairs (no more trams of this type were constructed) on tourist line number 700. In 1962, the routes were converted to buses. One of the two cars was scrapped, the other one (number 11) is preserved in the Tramway Museum of Malmkoping.




The TMBT (Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation) wanted to modernize its streetcar, so ordered one PCC car to Naniwa Koki Company (later Alna Sharyo Company in Hankyu Hanshin Holdings) in Osaka in 1953. Sumitomo Metal Industries as bogie manufacturer, and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation that had the electric motor licensee from Westinghouse Electric Corporation, also participated in the project. The streetcar was completed in 1954 with number 5501. The class 5500 was extended with other 6 cars (5502‚Äì5507), but these were called no real PCC cars because of their different configuration.

<doc id="447509" wikidata="Q3127574" url="?curid=447509" title="Harold Ballard">
<text>Harold Edwin Ballard (born Edwin Harold Ballard, July 30, 1903 ‚Äì April 11, 1990) was a Canadian businessman and sportsman. Ballard was an owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL) as well as their home arena, Maple Leaf Gardens. A member of the Leafs organization from 1940 and a senior executive from 1957, he became part-owner of the team in 1961 and was majority owner from February 1972 until his death. He won Stanley Cups in 1962, 1963, 1964 and 1967, all as part-owner. He was also the owner of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League (CFL) for 10 years from 1978 to 1988, winning a Grey Cup championship in 1986. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame (1977) and the Canadian Football Hall of Fame (1987). His is one of seven names to be on both the Stanley Cup and Grey Cup.

==Early years==
Ballard was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada as Edwin Harold Ballard. He later reversed the names and referred to himself as Harold E. Ballard. For six years before World War I, Ballard and his family lived in Norristown, Pennsylvania. They returned to Toronto where his father, English-born Sidney Eustace Ballard, founded Ballard Machinery Supplies Co., a sewing machine manufacturer, which at one point was one of Canada&#x27;s leading manufacturers of ice skates (it went out of the business in the early 1930s, when the Canadian skate market was dominated by CCM). Harold attended Upper Canada College as a boarding student until dropping out in his third year in 1919.

Ballard became a fan of speed skating and would attend skating events and hockey games, helping to promote the Ballard skates. For the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland, Ballard was appointed assistant manager of the Varsity Grads team that won the hockey gold medal.

As a member of the National Yacht Club, Ballard became an avid racer of Sea Fleas, small outboard hydroplanes. He competed in several regattas, and won the Toronto-Oakville marathon in 1929. Ballard was elected to the Yacht Club&#x27;s executive committee in January 1930. He participated in the 133-mile Albany, New York-New York City marathon in April 1930, finishing second in his class. About a month later, Ballard and two friends from the Yacht club were hurled from a boat into a frigid Lake Ontario. Ballard was pulled from the water unconscious, but one of his friends died. None of the three was wearing a life jacket.

==Hockey coach and manager==
Following the 1930 racing season, the Yacht Club sponsored a senior team in the Ontario Hockey Association called the Toronto National Sea Fleas. Ballard was made business manager. Under coach Harry Watson, the team won the Allan Cup in 1932. Watson chose not to return the following season, and Ballard took over the coaching duties. At first, the players welcomed Ballard behind the bench, but the mood soon changed, particularly after Ballard benched the team captain. That triggered a mutiny among some of the team&#x27;s top players, who resigned from the squad in November. The team had a poor year with Ballard coaching, but Ballard arranged a European tour for the Nationals which included competing in the 1933 Ice Hockey World Championships in Prague. There, the Nationals lost 2‚Äì1 in overtime to a team from the U.S.‚Äîthe first loss for a Canadian team at the world championships. While touring Europe, the Nationals were involved in several fights, both on the ice and off. In one incident, Ballard was arrested in Paris following a fracas at a hotel. The tour marked the end of Ballard&#x27;s career as a full-time hockey coach.

In 1934, Ballard became manager of the West Toronto Nationals OHA junior team and hired Leaf captain Hap Day as coach. When Day was busy with the Leafs and unavailable for games, Ballard would step behind the bench as acting coach. Under Day and Ballard, the Nationals won the Memorial Cup at the end of the 1935‚Äì36 season. The following season, Day and Ballard worked together to run a senior team sponsored by E. P. Taylor&#x27;s Dominion Brewery. At the same time, Ballard continued to work for Ballard Machinery, and took over the business after his father&#x27;s retirement in 1935.

After Day became coach of the Leafs in 1940, he recommended Ballard to the Leaf organization to run the Toronto Marlboros, the senior and junior teams owned by the Leafs. Ballard was made president and general manager. He would coach one more game, for the senior Marlies, during the 1950 Allan Cup final, after head coach Joe Primeau&#x27;s father died. The Marlboros lost the game but won the series and the championship.

In the early 1950s, Ballard hired his long-time friend Stafford Smythe, son of Leafs owner Conn Smythe, as managing director of the Marlboros. The Marlies won the Memorial Cup in 1955‚Äîtheir first championship in 26 years‚Äîand repeated the feat the following season. In 1944, Ballard formed Harold E. Ballard Ltd., the personal holding company he would later use to hold his interest in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd.

==Joins the Maple Leafs==
In 1957, Ballard moved up to the Maple Leafs as a member of a committee chaired by Stafford Smythe which oversaw hockey operations after Conn Smythe stepped down as general manager and Hap Day was pushed out of the Leafs organization. Ballard wasn&#x27;t initially named to the committee when it was unveiled in March 1957, but took the place of Ian Johnston nine months later. At age 54, Ballard was the oldest member of the group, which were otherwise all in their 30s and 40s. The committee came to be known as the &quot;Silver Seven&quot;.

During the hockey off-season in 1961, Ballard became founding president of the four-team Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League, which operated in Toronto, Hamilton, and Montreal. Steve Stavro, who would succeed Ballard as Leafs owner 30 years later, was co-owner of the Toronto City team. For the 1962 season, Ballard tried to introduce a hockey-style penalty box to soccer, but the rule change was not allowed by FIFA.

==Partner in Leafs ownership group==
In November 1961, Conn Smythe sold most of his shares in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to a consortium of his son Stafford, &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot; owner John W. H. Bassett, and Ballard. Ballard fronted Stafford Smythe most of the $2.3 million purchase price. Conn Smythe later claimed that he believed he was only selling his shares to his son, but it is very unlikely that Stafford could have acquired the millions he needed to buy the Leafs on his own.

As a reward for his role in the purchase, Ballard was named executive vice president of Maple Leaf Gardens, alternate governor of the Maple Leafs and chairman of the team&#x27;s hockey committee. He played a key role in the Leaf dynasty of the 1960s, winning Stanley Cups in 1962, 1963, 1964 and 1967.

However, Ballard soon began displaying tendencies that would eventually make him one of the most detested owners in NHL history. Just after the advent of colour television in Canada, the Maple Leafs installed a new lighting system. While it provided a clearer picture for fans, it caused a very sharp glare that distracted players. Ballard&#x27;s solution was to make the CBC pay for the upgrade. When &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;‚Ä≤s president, Ted Hough, balked at Ballard&#x27;s demands just before a broadcast, Ballard grabbed a fireman&#x27;s ax and threatened to cut the TV cable unless Hough agreed to pay. Hough relented, and the broadcast went on as scheduled.

Ballard&#x27;s greatest influence in this period was not on the ice, but on the financial performance of Maple Leaf Gardens. Within three years under the new owners, profits at the Gardens had tripled to just under $1 million. He negotiated lucrative deals to place advertising throughout the building, and greatly increased the number of seats in the Gardens. To make room for more seats, Ballard removed a large portrait of Queen Elizabeth II from the Gardens. When asked about it, Ballard replied &quot;She doesn&#x27;t pay me, I pay her. Besides, what the hell position can a queen play?&quot;

He also expanded the number of concerts, entertainment acts, and conventions booked in the building. Ballard booked The Beatles on each of their three North American tours from 1964 to 1966. On the second tour, in 1965, Ballard sold tickets for two shows, even though the agreement had been for only one. On the hot summer day of one of the concerts, Ballard ordered the building&#x27;s heat turned up, shut off the water fountains, and also delayed both of the concerts for over an hour. The only available refreshments were large soft drinks from the concession stands.

In 1969, Ballard and Stafford Smythe were charged with tax evasion and accused of using Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to pay for their personal expenses. Bassett, who had by this time become chairman of the board, received the support of the board of directors in an 8‚Äì7 vote to fire Smythe and Ballard. However, Bassett didn&#x27;t force Smythe and Ballard to sell their shares, and both men remained on the board. This proved to be a serious strategic blunder, as Smythe and Ballard controlled almost half the company&#x27;s shares between them. A year later, they staged a proxy war to regain control of the board. Ballard was reappointed executive vice president. Facing an untenable situation, Bassett resigned as chairman and sold his shares to Ballard and Stafford Smythe in September 1971.

Smythe died just six weeks later. At age 68, Ballard won a battle with Stafford&#x27;s family and bought his shares, giving him a 60 percent controlling interest in the Gardens. He installed himself as president and chairman of Maple Leaf Gardens and governor of the Maple Leafs.

==Leafs under Ballard&#x27;s sole ownership==

===Criminal trial and the Summit Series===
Shortly after taking control of the Leafs, Ballard stood trial on 49 counts of fraud, theft and tax evasion involving $205,000. He was accused by the Crown attorney of using funds from Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to pay for renovations to his home on Montgomery Rd., in Etobicoke. Funds were also used to renovate his Midland cottage, to rent limousines for his daughter&#x27;s wedding in 1967, and to buy motorcycles for his sons (passing off the expense as hockey equipment for the Marlboros), as well as placing money belonging to the corporation into a private bank account that he controlled along with Stafford Smythe. Ballard pleaded not guilty to all charges.

At the same time, Hockey Canada and the NHL Players Association had negotiated an agreement to hold an eight-game tournament between Canadian professional hockey players and the top players from the Soviet Union. The tournament would become known as the Summit Series. Just as Ballard&#x27;s trial was beginning, he told Hockey Canada that they were welcome to use any member of the Leafs on the Canadian team, could use Maple Leaf Gardens for their training camp, and could use the building for any or all of the games in the series, with the Gardens&#x27; share of the gate receipts being donated to the NHL players&#x27; pension fund. Ballard then partnered with long-time rival Alan Eagleson and Eagleson&#x27;s client Bobby Orr to get the television rights to the series, which would be used to benefit Hockey Canada and the players&#x27; union. At no time before or after his trial did Ballard show any interest in being associated with Eagleson or in having members of the Leafs play the Soviets, and the move was widely seen to be a means to generate favourable public relations. At the conclusion of the series, Ballard sent a bill to Hockey Canada for use of the building.

In August, just weeks before the series began, Ballard was convicted on 47 of the charges. Two months later, he was sentenced to nine years in a federal penitentiary. After a brief stay at Kingston Penitentiary, he was moved to a minimum-security facility that was part of Millhaven Institution. He finished his sentence at a halfway house in Toronto, and was paroled in October 1973 after serving a third of his sentence. After his parole, he stated that prison life was like staying in a motel, with colour television, golf, and steak dinners. Ballard even claimed to possess photographs of himself drinking beer with corrections officers and wearing one of their uniforms. During the time Harold was in prison, his son Bill managed Maple Leaf Gardens.

===Team management===

Ballard was a very hands-on owner who quickly became known for being irascible and cantankerous. He tried to micromanage the team, interfering with coaches and players. Soon after taking over as majority owner, he forced out several longtime front-office personnel and replaced them with his own men. For example, he cut the salary of chief scout and former Leafs star Bob Davidson by almost two-thirds, forcing Davidson to resign. Davidson had served in the Leafs organization for almost 40 years in various capacities.

Ballard&#x27;s opposition to European players was so virulent that a Leafs scout used Ballard&#x27;s time in jail to sign B√∂rje Salming, one of the NHL&#x27;s first great European players.

After Ballard took control during the 1971‚Äì72 season, one of the first challenges he faced was the creation of the World Hockey Association (WHA) as a competitor to the NHL. At the time, NHL teams relied on the reserve clause to keep players from jumping to other teams in the league, but the clause could not prevent players from leaving the NHL to join a different league.

At the end of the 1971‚Äì72 season, the Leafs only had three players signed to contracts for the next season: Rick Kehoe and veterans Jacques Plante and Bobby Baun. But Ballard did not take the unproven WHA seriously as a competitor and so was outbid on the services of several players in the Leafs organization. The biggest loss was goaltender Bernie Parent, a superstar in the making, who was offered a WHA contract with financial terms far beyond what Ballard was prepared to match. Along with Parent, Rick Ley, Jim Harrison, Brad Selwood, and Guy Trottier all left the Leafs for the WHA before the 1972‚Äì73 season, as did some minor league prospects in the Leafs&#x27; system as well as the team&#x27;s minor league coach, Marcel Pronovost. Paul Henderson and Mike Pelyk followed a year later. The players who stayed could use the threat of joining the WHA to negotiate better contracts, and Ballard always blamed the WHA for inflating players&#x27; salaries. Ballard never forgave the WHA for this, and became the leader of the hardline faction of NHL owners who opposed any merger with the upstart league.

In 1973, the WHA moved the Ottawa Nationals to Toronto as the Toronto Toros. A year later, they moved to the Gardens. Toros owner John F. Bassett (son of the elder John Bassett) had negotiated a lease with the elder Ballard&#x27;s son, Bill. However, by the time the Toros played their first game at the Gardens, Ballard had been released from prison. Angered that the WHA was literally in his backyard, the elder Ballard made the Toros&#x27; lease terms as onerous as possible. This became clear when the arena was dim for the first game. When an outraged Bassett complained, Ballard demanded $3,500 for use of the lights. He also removed the cushions from the home bench for Toros&#x27; games (he told an arena worker, &quot;Let &#x27;em buy their own cushions!&quot;) and denied them access to the Leafs locker room. These demands made it financially impossible for the Toros to survive in Toronto, and after the 1975-76 season they moved to Birmingham, Alabama.

When the NHL finally did take in four WHA teams after the 1978‚Äì79 season, Ballard refused to support the deal. He was not only angry at how the WHA had decimated his roster earlier in the decade, but also wasn&#x27;t enamored at the prospect of reduced television revenue. The WHA had insisted on bringing in all three of its surviving Canadian teams, meaning revenue from CBC telecasts now had to be split six ways rather than three.

At the time Ballard took over, the Leafs&#x27; captain was Dave Keon, who had been with the team since 1960. Ballard and Keon never got along, and when Keon&#x27;s contract expired in 1975, Ballard let it be known that Keon had no place on the team. However, he insisted on being compensated for Keon&#x27;s rights, and at the time there were no exceptions in the NHL&#x27;s reserve clause to fix or limit the level of compensation an owner could demand. Ballard set the price so high that potential suitors shied away, in effect preventing Keon from joining another NHL team. Keon was able to join the WHA&#x27;s Minnesota Fighting Saints, since the WHA had refused to recognize the reserve clause and successfully fought off an NHL lawsuit (championed in particular by Ballard) over the matter. When the Fighting Saints folded, Keon received an offer from the soon-to-be dynasty New York Islanders, but Ballard still owned Keon&#x27;s NHL rights and effectively blocked that deal, compelling Keon to move to the relatively stable New England Whalers. Even after the NHL-WHA merger was finalized over Ballard&#x27;s objections, it was only the intervention of NHL President John Ziegler that finally persuaded Ballard to not reclaim Keon&#x27;s rights (which would have effectively ended his career) and allow him to play three more seasons with the mediocre Hartford Whalers. Keon never forgave Ballard for how he had been treated, and it was more than 20 years before he was reconciled with the Leafs.

During the 1978‚Äì79 season, with the Leafs struggling to make the playoffs (in which the Leafs did, only to lose to the Montreal Canadiens in the quarter final round), Ballard fired the team&#x27;s popular head coach, Roger Neilson, against the wishes of the players. Two days later, Ballard asked Neilson to return, but with a paper bag over his head so as to conceal his identity. Neilson did return, without the paper bag. After the season, where the Maple Leafs were swept in the quarterfinals by the Canadiens, Ballard fired general manager Jim Gregory, replacing him with his predecessor, Punch Imlach. Gregory learned of the news when he received a call from an NHL executive offering him the directorship of the NHL Central Scouting Bureau, unbeknownst to him that Ballard had fired him.

===Relationship with Sittler===
Ballard&#x27;s desire to control players and their salaries also put him at odds with Alan Eagleson, executive director of the NHL Players&#x27; Association and a player agent whose clients included Keon&#x27;s successor as captain, Darryl Sittler. Ballard had once called Sittler &quot;the son I never had&quot;, but relations between the two took a turn for the worse with Sittler&#x27;s increasing prominence in the NHLPA. Around that time, the Leafs had made it as far as the Stanley Cup semifinals in 1978, losing to the two-time defending champions Montreal Canadiens. This led to renewed criticism of Ballard&#x27;s unwillingness to spend what it took to get the Leafs to the next level.

In July 1979, Ballard brought his longtime friend, Imlach, back to the organization as general manager. Imlach was as staunchly anti-union as Ballard; during his first stint in Toronto, he had been one of Eagleson&#x27;s most ardent foes. With Ballard&#x27;s support, Imlach moved to dismantle the roster and undermine Sittler&#x27;s influence, despite many analysts viewing the team as having a promising future. Sittler was apparently untouchable as he had a no-trade clause in his contract and, through his agent Eagleson, had insisted on $500,000 to waive it. When the Leafs traded Sittler&#x27;s close friend Lanny McDonald to the moribund Colorado Rockies on December 29, 1979, a member of the Leafs anonymously told the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that Leafs management would &quot;do anything to get at Sittler&quot; and was bent on undermining the captain&#x27;s influence on the team. Angry teammates trashed their dressing room in response. Sittler himself ripped the captain&#x27;s &quot;C&quot; off his sweater, later commenting that a captain had to be the go-between with players and management, and he no longer had any communication with management. Ballard would liken Sittler&#x27;s actions to burning the Canadian flag. Eagleson called the trade &quot;a classless act.&quot;

Through the summer of 1980, Ballard insisted that Sittler would not be back with the Leafs. As Imlach was preparing to trade Sittler to the Quebec Nordiques, he had a heart attack in August and was hospitalized. Ballard used the opportunity to name himself acting general manager and hold talks with Sittler, and the two agreed that Sittler would return to the team for the 1980‚Äì81 season. The two men appeared together at a news conference described as &quot;all smiles and buddy-buddy&quot; to announce that Sittler would not only be at training camp, but had reassumed his captaincy. Ballard told the press that the real battle had been between Imlach and Eagleson, and Sittler just got caught in the crossfire. Ballard also signed B√∂rje Salming to a new contract with terms that Imlach had refused to offer.

Ballard remained as &quot;de facto&quot; general manager even when Imlach recovered. In September 1981, after Imlach had another heart attack during training camp, Ballard told the media that Imlach&#x27;s poor health meant that &quot;he&#x27;s through as general manager&quot;. Imlach was never officially fired, but when he tried to return to his office in November, he found that his parking spot at Maple Leaf Gardens had been reassigned and Gerry McNamara had been made acting general manager. Imlach never returned to work and his contract was allowed to expire. Though Imlach was gone, Sittler&#x27;s relationship with the Leafs worsened again in the 1981‚Äì82 season and he was traded that year to the Philadelphia Flyers.

===1980s===
The McDonald trade sent the Leafs into a downward spiral. Even with the inclusion of what were effectively four expansion teams as per the terms of the &quot;merger&quot; with the WHA, the Leafs finished five games below .500 in 1980, although it was still good enough for a playoff berth. They would not post a winning record again in Ballard&#x27;s lifetime, going a franchise-record 13 consecutive seasons without a winning record. The low point came in 1984‚Äì85, when the Leafs finished the season with the worst record in the league, 32 games below .500. Their .300 winning percentage was the second-worst in franchise history. They nearly duplicated that dubious achievement in 1987‚Äì88. That year, they finished with a .325 winning percentage, fourth-worst in franchise history, and were only one point up on the Minnesota North Stars for the league&#x27;s worst record. Nevertheless, they still qualified for the playoffs under the playoff format in use at the time. In those days, the top four teams in each division made the playoffs, regardless of record. The Leafs and North Stars both played in the Norris Division, which was extremely weak that year; the Red Wings were the only team with a winning record. The Leafs defeated the Red Wings in the final game of the season, and backed into the playoffs when the Stars lost their final game hours later. It was the second time in three years that they had made the playoffs despite finishing with a winning percentage below .400. In 1985-86, they finished with a .356 winning percentage, the fourth-worst record in the league and fourth worst in franchise history. However, due to playing in a division where no team cracked the 90-point barrier, they still made the playoffs. Subsequent league expansions and format revisions make it impossible for a team so close to the bottom of the league standings to qualify for the playoffs today.

All told, the Leafs only had six winning seasons in Ballard&#x27;s 18-plus seasons as majority owner, and never finished higher than third in their division in any format. In Ballard&#x27;s last 13 seasons, they only finished above fourth once and won only two playoff series. Many fans consider the Ballard era to be the darkest period in team history.

Off the ice, the Maple Leafs under Ballard were one of the league&#x27;s most financially successful teams. However, this was largely because Ballard was unwilling to increase the payroll in order to improve the on-ice product, despite playing in the fourth-largest market. Even though the Leafs were barely competitive for much of the latter part of Ballard&#x27;s tenure, every game at Maple Leaf Gardens was sold out. Ballard thus felt he had little financial incentive to sign better players. However, many players were unwilling to sign with Toronto in any event because of Ballard&#x27;s reputation.

Ballard famously had his hand and footprints etched onto a concrete slab and placed it at centre ice of Maple Leaf Gardens, which deteriorated the quality of the Gardens ice.

==Maple Leaf Gardens under Ballard==
After Ballard&#x27;s release from prison, he had an apartment built at the Gardens facing Church Street where he would live through most of the year, while spending summers at his cottage near Lafontaine, Ontario in the Thunder Beach community.

The storied arena fell into disrepair during Ballard&#x27;s tenure. For example, when the roof leaked, he did little more than order plastic sheets to catch the rainwater.

===Other incidents and anecdotes===
Other notable incidents and anecdotes during Ballard&#x27;s time as majority owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Maple Leaf Gardens include:

* As a guest on Barbara Frum&#x27;s CBC Radio program &quot;As It Happens&quot; in March 1979, Ballard, speaking over the telephone, implied that &quot;Women are best in one position ‚Äì on their backs.&quot; When Frum attempted to ask him questions, he told her to keep quiet and stop interrupting him, and eventually hung up. The next night on her show, Frum read a conciliatory letter to Ballard forgiving him for his remarks, and signed it &quot;Your favourite BROAD-caster&quot;.
* In August 1979, to make room for private boxes, he had Foster Hewitt&#x27;s historic broadcast gondola dumped into an incinerator. This was in spite of protests from the Hockey Hall of Fame, who wished to acquire it. This happened about a year after Ballard had taken the radio broadcast rights to Leaf games away from Hewitt&#x27;s CKFH and sold them to CKO. Hewitt unsuccessfully appealed the deal to the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission.
* In 1977 the NHL, facing competition from the WHA, passed a rule that players&#x27; last names must be on the backs of their jerseys. Ballard refused, citing it as a threat to program sales. After being threatened with a large fine, Ballard &quot;complied&quot; by putting the names in blue letters on the Leafs&#x27; blue road jerseys, and in white on their white home jerseys, making them unreadable. After being fined, he backed down and put the names in the opposite colours.
* &quot;If you can call a Chevrolet a Chev, why can&#x27;t you call a Japanese a Jap?&quot; Ballard to Ottawa writer Earl McRae in the 1980s.
* Angered by (or maybe jealous of) Conn Smythe&#x27;s success with the club and his inability to bring a Stanley Cup to Toronto under his sole ownership, Ballard sold all of the Cup banners that had hung from the rafters of Maple Leafs Gardens for years. Ballard had managed to get his name on the Cup four times while part-owner of the team. When the Leafs moved to the Air Canada Centre in 1999, the NHL presented the team with new banners to replace those Ballard had sold.
* Pennants proclaiming National Hockey League championships, Stanley Cup victories and other triumphs used to hang from the rafters of Maple Leaf Gardens. But they were taken down (on the premise that they were obstructing some customers&#x27; views). In 1969, painters doing over the Gardens&#x27; television booth used (perhaps unknowingly) a dozen or more of these banners to catch paint drips. Commented former Leafs&#x27; captain Syl Apps, &quot;I would think that the pennants could have been put to better use than that. We worked awfully hard to get them. I&#x27;m rather shocked that they mean so little.&quot;
* Ballard had special gold medals made up for the Canadian team, after they were expelled from the 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships as a result of a bench-clearing brawl. Ballard stated that &quot;I believe the Canadian boys deserve the gold medal and I&#x27;m going to see to it that they get them. Imagine how these Russians engineered this whole thing over there just because they&#x27;ve got a lousy team and were scared to go home finishing in sixth place.&quot;
* Toronto sportswriter Jim Hunt had many run-ins with Ballard. It was Hunt that gave Ballard the nickname Pal Hal, which would be the title of Dick Beddoes&#x27; biography about Ballard. The first notable incident with Ballard took place as a rebuttal towards Hunt&#x27;s comments about the Toronto Maple Leafs. Ballard went on the air after the next Maple Leafs game and called Hunt a bastard. He then told TV host Dave Hodge that his comments were about someone whose last name starts with one of the first three letters of the alphabet. Hodge responded by saying Jim Bunt. Ballard responded by saying the name started with the letter C.
* At the same postgame show, Ballard proceeded to get into an on-air argument with Dick Beddoes, which involved Beddoes saying Ballard would be better suited to guessing weights at the CNE rather than running a hockey team. Ballard responded by saying that Beddoes should be a barker at a girlie show. This continued until hockey legendary referee Red Storey appeared, dressed as Santa. When asked what he was bringing Ballard, Storey replied penicillin.
* For his 85th birthday party, Ballard invited Hunt, who was then with the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;. The party was on July 30, 1988, and held at Ballard&#x27;s cottage near Lafontaine. Hunt attended the party with a female photographer named Veronica Milne. Hunt and Milne got lost on the way to the party and arrived an hour late. Upon their arrival, Ballard responded by saying, &quot;Hunt, I know why you‚Äôre late. You were humping her in the back seat of the car.&quot;
*Ballard repeatedly clashed with Toronto City Council, especially over the question of liquor licensing. Eventually, Maple Leaf Gardens became one of only two dry major sports venues in North America (the other being Delta Center in Salt Lake City). While Ballard was eventually to secure a liquor license for Ivor Wynne Stadium in 1982, he was never able to do so for the Gardens, in part due to his abrasive personality and acrimonious relationship with key politicians such as Councilor Kay Gardner. It would not be until almost three years after Ballard&#x27;s death that the first beer would be legally sold at Maple Leaf Gardens.

==Other involvements==

===Canadian Football League===
In the early 1970s, Ballard made an application for a second Canadian Football League team to be based in Toronto, to play at Varsity Stadium. At the time, the CFL still consisted of two autonomous conferences. Ballard&#x27;s application would have required the unanimous consent of the four Eastern Football Conference owners to have been approved under the rules in effect at the time. In the West, CFL teams had come under significant pressure resulting from the introduction of WHA franchises in the four largest Western markets, therefore Western Football Conference teams were generally supportive of Ballard&#x27;s efforts to become a CFL owner. However, hostility to Ballard&#x27;s overture from the Toronto Argonauts (then owned by Ballard&#x27;s former partner John W. H. Bassett) ensured it never went anywhere.

In 1974, when Bassett put the Toronto Argonauts up for sale, Ballard offered to buy the team for $3 million, but his offer was rejected. Shortly after, Ballard tried to buy the Hamilton Tiger-Cats from owner Michael DeGroote, but that offer was also rejected. Three money-losing seasons later, in January 1978, DeGroote contacted Ballard and sold him the club for $1.3 million. Federal Labour Minister John Munro‚Äîfrom Hamilton‚Äîled an unsuccessful campaign against the deal, while Bassett, having sold the Argos to William R. Hodgson by this time, was also unable to intervene. Later that year, Ballard blocked Bassett&#x27;s attempt to repurchase the Argos. However, Ballard did not object the following year when Hodgson sold his stake in the Argos to Carling O&#x27;Keefe notwithstanding the fact the brewer also owned a team in the WHA (the Quebec Nordiques).

The Tiger-Cats made the playoffs every year under Ballard&#x27;s ownership and played in four Grey Cup championship games, losing in 1980, 1984 and 1985 before finally winning the Cup in 1986. As owner of the Tiger Cats, Ballard claimed to be losing a million dollars a year. In 1986, Ballard publicly called the Tiger Cats a bunch of overpaid losers. After the Tiger Cats beat the Toronto Argonauts in the 1986 Eastern Final, Ballard said &quot;You guys may still be overpaid, but after today, no one can call you losers.&quot; A few days later, the Tiger Cats won the 1986 Grey Cup by beating the Edmonton Eskimos 39‚Äì15 and Ballard said it was worth every penny.

During his tenure as owner of the Tiger-Cats, Ballard for a short time had the Tiger-Cats logo painted at centre ice of Maple Leaf Gardens in place of the blue Maple Leaf.

Ballard sold the team to businessman David Braley on February 24, 1989. During his tenure, he repeatedly threatened to move the franchise to Toronto (70¬†km north). He had claimed losses in excess of $20 million over 11 seasons with the Tiger-Cats.

===Major League Baseball===
In the 1970s, Ballard had also bankrolled a group, headed by Hiram Walker Distillers vice-president Lorne Duguid, intent on bringing Major League Baseball to Toronto. According to Duguid, Ballard had been willing to pay as much as $15 million so he could buy and relocate the San Francisco Giants to Toronto, even though the franchise was only worth around $8 million. However, in the end, it was a partnership of the Labatt Brewing Company, Howard Webster, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) that brought baseball to Toronto, as they were awarded an expansion team in the American League for $7 million that became the Toronto Blue Jays, who began play in 1977.

==Supporters==
Despite his reputation, Ballard was well known for his charitable activities, and even leased out MLG for many functions. He was recognized for this on his citation during his 1977 Hockey Hall of Fame induction. However, as Ken Dryden put it in his book &quot;The Game&quot;, he seemed &quot;like [a] wrestling villain who touches the audience to make his next villainy seem worse.&quot;

Dave &quot;Tiger&quot; Williams who played with the Leafs from 1973 to 1980 had a close relationship with Ballard. Years later, Williams would remark that all Ballard would want from his players was an honest day of hard work. In gratitude, Williams shot a bear during a winter hunt and skinned it for Ballard&#x27;s office.

==Death and estate==
Ballard died from various health complications on April 11, 1990, at the age of 86. Even before his death, there had been battles between his children, Bill Ballard, Harold Ballard Jr., and Mary Elizabeth Flynn, and his longtime companion, Yolanda Ballard. Although she and Harold never married, Yolanda had her name legally changed. She claimed to have been with Ballard for eight years at the time of his death. Yolanda&#x27;s lawyer Howard Levitt stated there had been a marriage proposal.

In 1989, Bill Ballard was convicted of assaulting Yolanda and fined $500. Yolanda was not invited to Ballard&#x27;s funeral, nor to the reading of his will. She fought with Ballard&#x27;s family and partners over Ballard&#x27;s estate following his death. In his will, Ballard had left Yolanda $50,000 a year for the rest of her life, but she considered this inadequate and sued for $192,600 and later $381,000 a year. The court awarded her $91,000.

According to Ballard&#x27;s lawyer, his estate was worth less than $50 million. Most of the money was left to a charitable foundation. Ballard left his personal belongings to his children and grandchildren. Ballard&#x27;s three children had all previously received shares in Maple Leaf Gardens that they sold for more than $15 million each. The executors of Ballard&#x27;s will were Steve Stavro, Don Giffin and Don Crump. In 1991, Stavro paid off a $20 million loan that had been made to Ballard in 1980 by Molson. In return, he was given an option to buy Maple Leaf Gardens shares from Ballard&#x27;s estate. Molson also agreed to sell its stake in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to Stavro. That deal closed in 1994, and shortly after Stavro bought Ballard&#x27;s shares from the estate for $34 a share or $75 million. The purchase was the subject of a securities commission review and a lawsuit from Ballard&#x27;s son Bill, but the deal stood and Stavro and his partners in MLG Ventures became the new owner of the Leafs and Maple Leaf Gardens.

Ballard is buried at Park Lawn Cemetery in Toronto with his wife Dorothy.

<text>Sangita Kalanidhi () is the title awarded annually to a Carnatic musician by the Madras Music Academy.

From 1929 to 1941, the award did not exist. The award was conceived in 1942 by Academy President K. V. Krishnaswami Iyer and on 1 January 1943 all musicians who had presided over the annual conferences between 1929 and 1942 were awarded the title. This included 2 or 3 past presidents - Palamarneri Swaminatha Iyer (1931), probably Umayalpuram Swaminatha Iyer (1936) and Mangudi Chidambara Bhagavatar (1937) - but no posthumous award has been presented since then. At times, 1946 is cited as the year of Umayalpuram Swaminatha Iyer&#x27;s death, in which case he might have received the Sangita Kalanidhi in his lifetime.

<text>Umm Khalid (), also called Mukhalid, was a Palestinian village in the Tulkarm Subdistrict, west of Tulkarm. It was an ancient site in the central coastline of what is now the city of Netanya, Israel.

==History==
Archaeological findings around the village included the remains of towers, fortresses, wells, reservoirs, cisterns, and pottery.

Flint tools found around the area suggest that the site might have been inhabited since prehistoric times.

First century BCE remnants of buildings, installations and burial caves have been found.

===Crusader castle===
The village site contained &quot;Castellum Rogerii Langobardi&quot;, the castle of Roger the Lombard, built by the Crusaders. The building was mentioned in 1135, mostly destroyed c. 1948, and partly excavated in 1985/86. It appears to have been continuously in use from the Crusader period until 1948.

===Ottoman period===

Umm Khalid was one of four villages founded in the 18th century, near the coast north of the Yarkon River (along with the villages of Al-Shaykh Muwannis, Al-Haram, and Ijlil). According to historian Roy Marom, the establishment of Umm Khalid &quot;demonstrates that the expansion of settlement in the southern Sharon was the result of the internal expansion of the core settlement by residents of the mountainous highlands of Samaria, and not by Egyptian ‚Äòpenetrators‚Äô as previously claimed.&quot;

The village was named &quot;Omm Kaled&quot; on a 1799 map of the area, and the village was razed by the troops of Napoleon during their return to Egypt after their failed siege of Acre in 1799.

The British traveller James Silk Buckingham, who passed through the village (&quot;El Mukalid&quot;) in 1816, described it as still &quot;rather poor&quot;, while noting that the village resembled an Egyptian one in form and constructions of its huts.

In the 19th century, Umm Khalid was a rest area between al-Tantura and Ras al-Ayn, where Ottoman officials stopped and received dignitaries. When Mary Rogers, the sister of the British vice-consul in Haifa, visited the Umm Khalid in 1856 she described it as a flourishing village, and noted the extensive watermelon gardens to the west of the village.

In 1863, Victor Gu√©rin found the village to have about 300 inhabitants. In 1873, among the ruins were seen a vaulted building with remnants of a second story, a well built well, and six circular rock-cut granaries.

In 1870/1871 (1288 AH), an Ottoman census listed the village in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (sub-district) of Wadi al-Sha&#x27;ir.

In 1882, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described the village as &quot;A small mud village, with ruins, and a sacred place to the south. On the east is a good masonry well, with troughs and a wheel for raising the water. ... There are also cisterns, and a pond with mud banks. There are cornfields to the east, but the soil is very sandy. The place is famous for its water melons, which are shipped at the little harbour called Minet Abu Zabura.&quot;

===British Mandate period===
In the 1922 census of Palestine there were 307 villagers, all Muslim, increasing in the 1931 census to 586; 580 Muslims and 6 Christians, in a total of 131 houses.

At the village center was a mosque, an elementary school for boys, and four shops for groceries and fabrics. In the 1944/45 statistics, Um Khalid had 970 inhabitants; 960 Muslims and 10 Christians, with a total of 2,894 dunums of land. Of this, a total of 47 dunums were used for citrus and bananas, while 1,830 dunums were planted with cereals. At the same time, it was registered that 2,894 dunums of land was Arab owned, 882 Jewish owned, while 89 dunam was public property.

===1948 and after===
According to an Israeli military report, Umm Khalid was evacuated 20 March 1948. Walid Khalidi speculates that the village was located in an area which was regarded by the Zionist leadership as the core of the planned Jewish state and would therefore have been desirable that the Arab residents were made to leave before 15 May.

The American historian Rosemarie Esber interviewed refugees from Umm Khalid. According to Ahamed &#x27;Uthman, Zionist surrounded and blockaded the village in 1947, and continued into 1948:

Much of the village land has been engulfed by the suburbs of the city of Netanya, founded in 1929 one kilometer to the west. The settlement of Gan Chefer, founded in 1940, and Nira, founded in 1941, were merged in 1953 to form a single, large settlement named Sha&#x27;ar Hefer; this settlement covers part of the village land.

According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, the structures on the village land were in 1992: &quot;The village site has become part of the city of Netanya. Some houses remain and are used either as residences or for commercial purposes such as warehouses for Israeli companies. The land in the vicinity are planted in citrus trees.

In 1997, bulldozers leveling ground for a school building in Netanya uncovered remains of the cemetery of Umm Khalid. The &quot;Aqsa Association for the Preservation of Consecrated Islamic Property&quot; petitioned the High Court of Justice. As a result, the city of Netanya agreed to halt work in the area which had not been damaged, and to put up a sign: &quot;Here is the Muslim cemetery of the village Umm Khalid.&quot; The Muslims refused to accept that the area should be turned into a park, stating that &quot;No foot shall tread on the graves.&quot;

<text>Khirbat Zalafa () was a small Palestinian Arab village in the Tulkarm Subdistrict, located about northwest of Tulkarm. It was depopulated during the 1948 Palestine war. It was occupied by Yishuv forces on April 15, 1948 as a part of operation &quot;Coastal Clearing.&quot;

==History==
Remains from a settlement dating to the Roman-Byzantine era have been found here.

In the modern era, the people of Khirbat Zalafa came from Attil to farm the village land. Gradually they settled in the village so they could be closer to their land. In the late 19th century, Khirbat Zalafa was described as a small hamlet with springs to the south.

==British Mandate era==
In the 1922 census of Palestine there were 63 villagers, all Muslim. At the time of the 1931 census, the village was counted under Attil, together with Jalama and Al-Manshiyya.

The village had a small core of houses, with many dwellings scattered throughout on the agricultural lands. The agriculture was based on watermelons, vegetables, grain and olives.

By the 1944/45 statistics the village had 210 Muslims, while jurisdiction was 7,713 dunams, of which 6,865 was Arab owned, 617 was Jewish owned, while 231 was publicly owned. Of this, 6,798 dunums were allotted to cereals, 38 dunum was devoted to citrus and bananas ad 6 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, while 3 dunams were classified as built-up, urban land.


==1948 and after==
The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village in 1992: &quot;The village has been completely levelled. Both the original site and the surrounding lands are covered with Israeli citrus orchards.&quot;

There are no Israeli settlements on village land.

<doc id="447533" wikidata="Q717540" url="?curid=447533" title="William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington">
<text>William John Robert Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington (10 December 1917 ‚Äì 9 September 1944) was a British politician and British Army officer. He was the elder son of Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire, and therefore the heir to the dukedom. He was killed in action in the Second World War during fighting in the Low Countries in September 1944 whilst leading a company of the Coldstream Guards.

==Early life==
Lord Hartington was born on 10 December 1917 in London, England. He was the elder son of Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire, and his wife, Lady Mary Gascoyne-Cecil. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge.

He was a member of the Conservative Party, and was selected as the official candidate of the Wartime Coalition for the West Derbyshire by-election on 18 February 1944, in the constituency local to Chatsworth. He was faced by Charles Frederick White, Jr., who resigned from the Labour Party to run as an Independent candidate, evading the Wartime Coalition&#x27;s ban on partisan campaigning. West Derbyshire had been held by Conservatives since 1923 (Hartington&#x27;s father and then his uncle by marriage). In a contentious campaign, White solidly defeated Hartington with 57.7% of the vote to 41.5%.

==Second World War and death==
He received a commission as an officer into the British Army&#x27;s Coldstream Guards regiment during the Second World War. In August 1944, during the liberation of Europe in the West from Nazi Germany, Hartington&#x27;s unit, the 5th Battalion Coldstream Guards, as a part of the Guards Armoured Division, was engaged in heavy fighting in France. In early September 1944, it crossed the River Somme and pushed Eastward towards Brussels, where it was one of the first to liberate the city. Of the townsfolk and villagers who turned out and cheered the Allies and, in some cases, decorated their tanks, Hartington wrote to his wife of feeling &quot;so unworthy of it all living as I have in reasonable safety and comfort during these years... I have a permanent lump in my throat and long for you to be here as it is an experience which few can have and which I would love to share with you.&quot;

On 9 September 1944, Hartington was shot dead at the age of 26 by a sniper whilst leading a company trying to capture the town of Heppen in Belgium from troops of the German Waffen-SS. He is buried at the Leopoldsburg War Cemetery.

==Personal life==
He married American socialite Kathleen Kennedy on 6 May 1944 at the Register Office in Chelsea Town Hall on King&#x27;s Road in London. She was the daughter of former U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Joseph Kennedy Sr, and the sister of John, Robert, and Ted Kennedy. The Duke of Devonshire and the bride&#x27;s eldest brother Joseph P. Kennedy Jr, then a lieutenant in the United States Navy, signed the marriage register, and the Duke of Rutland served as best man. Her mother, Rose, disapproved of the union because the Kennedy family were Roman Catholic and the Dukes of Devonshire were Anglican, and neither would be married in the other&#x27;s faith.

<doc id="447538" wikidata="Q3568789" url="?curid=447538" title="William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth">
<text>William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth, PC, FRS (20 June 1731 ‚Äì 15 July 1801), styled as Viscount Lewisham from 1732 to 1750, was a British statesman who served as Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1772 to 1775, during the initial stages of the American Revolution. He is also the namesake of Dartmouth College.

==Early life==
Dartmouth was the son of George Legge, Viscount Lewisham, who died when Dartmouth was one year old. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Arthur Kaye, 3rd Baronet. He entered Trinity College, Oxford, in 1748, and succeeded his grandfather in the earldom in 1750.
It was Lord Dartmouth who, in 1764, at the suggestion of Thomas Haweis, recommended John Newton, the former slave trader and author of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, to Edmund Keene, the Bishop of Chester. He was instrumental in Newton&#x27;s acceptance for the Anglican ministry.

==Political career==
Lord Dartmouth&#x27;s political career began with the presidency of the Board of Trade and Foreign Plantations from 1765-1766.

===Secretary for the Colonies===

Lord Dartmouth was Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1772 to 1775. He was in this role during the Boston Tea Party. He supported the Intolerable Acts and the Quebec Act.

In 1772, in correspondence with Sir William Johnson, the Superintendent of Northern Indian Affairs in America, he suggested that there was no reasonable way the British Government could support new trade regulations with the Indians. He sympathised with Johnson&#x27;s arguments but stated the Colonies did not seem inclined to concur with any new regulations.

He received many letters from North Carolina royal governor Josiah Martin in the summer of 1775 communicating preparations the Loyalist government was making against Patriot militia units and events of the revolution.

He served as Lord Privy Seal from 1775-1782.

Lord Dartmouth&#x27;s arrival in the Colonies was celebrated by Phillis Wheatley&#x27;s famous poem, &quot;To the Right Honourable William, Earl of Dartmouth.&quot;

==Philanthropy==

Lord Dartmouth was a large donor to and the leading trustee for the English trust that would finance the establishment of the Moor&#x27;s Charity School, in Lebanon, Connecticut, by Eleazar Wheelock to educate and convert the Indians.

Wheelock subsequently founded Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, naming the school in Lord Dartmouth&#x27;s honour, in hopes of getting his financial support. Lord Dartmouth refused. In London, Lord Dartmouth supported the new Foundling Hospital, a charitable institution for the care and maintenance of London&#x27;s abandoned children. He served as a vice-president of the organisation from 1755 until his death. The famous painter Sir Joshua Reynolds painted the Earl&#x27;s portrait and donated it to the hospital.

The portrait is still in the Foundling Hospital Collection and can be seen at the Foundling Museum in London. He was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society on 7 November 1754.

==Marriage and children==

Lord Dartmouth married Frances Catherine Nicholl, daughter of Sir Charles Gounter Nicoll, on 11 January 1755. They had nine children together:
* George Legge, 3rd Earl of Dartmouth (born 3 October 1755, died 10 November 1810)
*Hon William Legge (born 4 February 1757)
*Hon Charles Gounter Legge (born 18 May 1759)
*Hon Heneage Legge (born 7 May 1761)
* Hon Henry Legge (born 23 January 1765, died 19 April 1844)
* Admiral the Hon Sir Arthur Kaye Legge KCB (born 25 October 1766, died 12 May 1835)
* Rt Rev and Hon Edward Legge (11 December 1767 - 27 January 1827), Bishop of Oxford 1816‚Äì27
*The Ven and Hon Augustus George Legge (born 21 April 1773, died 1828), Archdeacon of Winchester 1814‚Äì19
* Lady Charlotte Legge (5 October 1774 - 5 November 1848), married Charles Duncombe, 1st Baron Feversham

==Death==
Dartmouth died at Blackheath, Kent, on 15 July 1801, aged 70. He was buried in Trinity Church in the Minories on 3 August 1801.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, George. Lady Dartmouth died in July 1805. The family lived at Sandwell Hall (since demolished) in Sandwell Valley.

<doc id="447541" wikidata="Q219237" url="?curid=447541" title="Rick Astley">
<text>Richard Paul Astley (born 6 February 1966) is an English singer, radio DJ and podcaster. He gained fame through his association with the production trio Stock Aitken Waterman, releasing the 1987 album &quot;Whenever You Need Somebody&quot;, which sold 15 million copies worldwide and was certified Platinum by both the BPI and the RIAA. His debut single &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; was a No. 1 hit in over 25 countries, winning the 1988 Brit Award for Best British Single. The song also stayed at the top of the UK chart for five weeks in 1987 and was the best-selling single of that year. His 1988 single &quot;Together Forever&quot; also topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was one of his eight songs to reach the UK Singles Chart Top 10.

In 1988, Astley followed up his debut album with &quot;Hold Me in Your Arms&quot; which achieved Platinum and Gold certifications internationally. The lead single &quot;She Wants to Dance with Me&quot; became a worldwide Top 10 hit. In 1991, he left Stock Aitken Waterman moving his musical direction towards soul, which he explored on his other albums. His 1991 single &quot;Cry for Help&quot; was Astley&#x27;s last single to reach the Top 10 in either the US or UK. In 1993, he retired from music to focus on spending time with his partner and daughter. He returned to the music industry in 2000 and released &quot;50&quot; to celebrate his 50th birthday in 2016, with the album debuting in the UK at No.¬†1. His most recent studio album &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot; was released in 2023.

Astley has sold approximately 40 million records worldwide and was nominated in 1989 for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist but lost to Tracy Chapman. During the period between his debut release and his fifth single, Astley outsold every other artist in the world. In the United Kingdom, Astley was also in the Top 40 every week for the first six months of his career. He became an internet phenomenon in 2007 following the emergence of the Rickrolling meme, which utilizes the music video for &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;, and his career was revitalised by the meme&#x27;s popularity. A year after the Rickrolling meme began, he was voted &quot;Best Act Ever&quot; at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2008. On 28 July 2021, &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; became the fourth 1980s song to reach one billion views on YouTube.

==Early life==
Richard Paul Astley was born on 6 February 1966 in Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire, the fourth child of Horace and Cynthia Astley. His parents divorced when he was 5 and Astley was brought up by his father who was &quot;really, really pissed off a lot of the time... but he was great as well, he was really loving&quot;. Rick remained in very close contact with his mother, who lived a few streets away. Describing his childhood, Astley stated &quot;There was definitely an element of &#x27;There&#x27;s something very wrong in this family.&#x27; I can&#x27;t even say I&#x27;ve got these exact memories of it, I just know it was a bit odd.&quot;

Astley would also later recall that his worst childhood memory was &quot;Walking in the kitchen and seeing my dad with his hands around my mum&#x27;s neck. After something like that, things get broken and destroyed in your emotional and mental make-up. It was not Walt Disney; it was not what&#x27;s supposed to happen. Shouting and arguing is bad enough, but for me something [broke] that day. Everything about it terrified me and just completely flipped me out. No kid should ever see that.&quot; In an interview ahead of the publication of his autobiography, Astley said &quot;I think it did form me as a person, definitely, and formed a lot of my choices of why I went into music and why I wanted to be on a stage and why I wanted people&#x27;s attention ‚Äì because I don&#x27;t think I got enough attention from my parents.&quot;

When he was 10, Astley began singing in a local church choir, which began his love of music. During his schooldays, Astley played the drums in a number of local bands, where he met guitarist David Morris. After leaving school at 16, Astley was employed during the day as a driver in his father&#x27;s market-gardening business and played drums on the Northern club circuit at night in bands such as Give Way ‚Äì specialising in covering Beatles and Shadows songs ‚Äì and FBI, which won several local talent competitions.

==Career==
===1985‚Äì1986: Signing with Stock Aitken Waterman===
In 1985, Astley was performing as a drummer for the soul band FBI, with Morris on guitar. They were a well-known local band, gigging in pubs and clubs. When FBI&#x27;s lead singer left the band, and Morris left to concentrate on his career in hairdressing, Astley offered to be the lead vocalist. That was when he was noticed by the record producer Pete Waterman at a Warrington nightclub, who offered him the opportunity to come to London to work at the Pete Waterman Limited (PWL) recording studio with RCA Records publishing his records. Although Astley initially turned down Waterman&#x27;s proposal, several months later he accepted the offer and moved into Waterman&#x27;s London flat. SAW also hired most of FBI, including Morris as a guitarist/songwriter.

Under the tutelage of the production team of Mike Stock, Matt Aitken, and Waterman, known as Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW), Astley was taught about the recording process and groomed for his future career, starting off as the recording studio &quot;tea boy&quot;, an apprenticeship that lasted two years. The reason for Astley to be hired as a &quot;tape op&quot; was to overcome his shyness. Reflecting on this time, Astley said: &quot;I was seeing other people have No. 1 hits, and I&#x27;d think: &#x27;Come on, boys&#x27;. But it wasn&#x27;t that they had forgotten me, they just had a lot of records to make. I knew, though, that when I got my turn, it would be a big thing, because Stock Aitken Waterman were becoming this big hit machine.&quot;

===1987‚Äì1989: Success===
In March 1987, Astley contributed vocals to &quot;Let It Be&quot; which was recorded by charity supergroup Ferry Aid. The single topped the UK Singles Chart for three weeks, and was certified gold for shipping over 500,000 copies. It was also a No. 1 hit in Norway and Switzerland. Astley&#x27;s first single was &quot;When You Gonna&quot;, released as a duet between Astley and singer Lisa Fabien; the song was produced by Phil Harding and Ian Curnow. It was released in May 1987, and with no promotion managed to chart at No. 17 in the Netherlands and No. 20 in Belgium. It also charted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart at No. 11.

&quot;We were at a stage early on with Rick, when no one knew quite what to do with him,&quot; recalled Harding. &quot;The idea was to make him happen in the clubs... but the song opened up the doors for him at Capital Radio.&quot; Astley had also contributed to another duet with O&#x27;Chi Brown, &quot;Learning to Live (Without Your Love)&quot; for her 1986 album, &quot;O&#x27;Chi&quot;. Astley was uncredited on the album and received no royalties. The song was belatedly released as a cash-in single in October 1987. The song failed to chart on the UK Singles Chart. The two singers never met, and Brown first heard Astley&#x27;s vocal when she was given a copy of her album.

Astley&#x27;s first solo offering was &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;, recorded on New Year&#x27;s Day 1987, and released eight months later, in August. &quot;At first, Pete felt we should do a Motown cover,&quot; said Mike Stock. &quot;The first thing we recorded was The Temptations&#x27; &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot; and that&#x27;s when I first properly heard his voice. I said to Pete and Matt that singing a cover would be to underplay and undervalue his undoubted vocal strengths, and that we should write Rick his own song. That&#x27;s when we came up with Never Gonna Give You Up.&quot; The concept for the song was suggested by Waterman after Astley spoke to him of his devotion to his then girlfriend, with the song&#x27;s tune, chords and lyrics composed by Stock and Matt Aitken.

Mike Stock stated that the Colonel Abrams hit &quot;Trapped&quot; (1985) was a big influence on &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;, saying: &quot;For Rick Astley&#x27;s song I didn&#x27;t want it to sound like Kylie or Bananarama so I looked at the Colonel Abrams track &#x27;Trapped&#x27; and recreated that syncopated bassline in a way that suited our song.&quot; Initial mixing was done by Phil Harding, with the song&#x27;s distinctive synthetic string and brass lines later added by Fairlight operator Ian Curnow. The final mix was provided by PWL remixer Pete Hammond, who made the vocals more prominent. His completed extended mix was edited down by Stock and Aitken to become the radio version.

Although his producers were initially unenthusiastic about the track, his distinctive rich, deep voice combined with dance-pop made the song an immediate success, spending five weeks at the top of the British charts and becoming the year&#x27;s highest-selling single. The song was also a worldwide No. 1 hit, topping the charts in 24 other countries, including the United States, Australia, and West Germany. The single reached the No. 1 spot on the year-end singles charts in both the United Kingdom and South Africa. &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; won Best British Single at the 1988 BPI Awards (now called the BRIT Awards), and Astley performed it in front of a global audience of 100 million. Assessing the status of the track as producers Stock Aitken Waterman&#x27;s biggest and most enduring hit, Stock confessed he struggled to completely understand why the song had struck such a chord, but suggested its massive success was down to a combination of the song, the singer, and the international clout of record label RCA.

Astley&#x27;s next single was &quot;Whenever You Need Somebody&quot;, which was released in October 1987. The single was a recycled Stock Aitken Waterman song, originally recorded by O&#x27;Chi Brown in 1985, which Stock said was resurrected in the rush to gather strong follow up material in the wake of Astley&#x27;s unexpectedly huge global success. Astley&#x27;s version of &quot;Whenever You Need Somebody&quot; was a major hit on the charts, being a Top 5 hit in almost all the countries where it was released. It became successful in Europe, reaching No. 1 in seven countries, including West Germany and Sweden. It also reached No. 3 in the United Kingdom, a position it held for three weeks. Though not released as a single in America, it was released in Canada. Discussing Astley&#x27;s success with the track, Brown complimented the singer on his voice and praised the chart performance of his cover.

In November 1987, the album &quot;Whenever You Need Somebody&quot;, containing four tracks written by Astley, reached No. 1 in both Britain and Australia and No. 10 in America. It was certified 4√ó Platinum in England and Canada, and 2√ó Platinum in America. It is Astley&#x27;s most best-selling album and it sold 15.2 million copies worldwide, making Astley the top-selling British act of the year. The album is listed as the 136th best-selling album in Spain, and was the seventh best-selling album of 1987 in the United Kingdom. Alex Henderson of AllMusic stated that SAW &quot;should definitely be proud of their work&quot; on this &quot;often captivating debut album&quot; which &quot;proved [the singer] to be a welcome addition to the British R&amp;B scene&quot;; he added that the &quot;music approach is very much a production of the &#x27;70s&quot; and highlighted tracks like &quot;Together Forever&quot;, &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Goodbye&quot;.

In December 1987, Astley released a cover version of the Nat King Cole classic &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;. Rivals EMI, hoping to see their act the Pet Shop Boys become UK Christmas No. 1, re-released Cole&#x27;s version. That led to a slowdown of purchases of Astley&#x27;s version, allowing the Pet Shop Boys to reach the top spot with their cover version of &quot;Always on My Mind&quot;. &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot; sold over 200,000 copies and gained a Silver certification from the BPI; it also peaked in the UK at No. 2 for two weeks. The second half of the double A-side single was a dance number, &quot;My Arms Keep Missing You&quot;, which was released as an independent single in Germany and reached No. 6.

Astley&#x27;s fourth single release was &quot;Together Forever&quot; in January 1988, reaching No. 2 in the UK. It was denied the top spot by Kylie Minogue&#x27;s debut &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot;, which reached No. 1 following her successful role as Charlene Robinson in &quot;Neighbours&quot;. &quot;Together Forever&quot; was more successful in America, topping the charts. It also topped the charts in Canada, Ireland and Spain, and was a Top 10 hit in many European countries. His fifth and final release from his debut album was &quot;It Would Take a Strong Strong Man&quot;. It was mainly intended for the American market and was not released in the United Kingdom and most of Europe. It was another hit, reaching No. 10 on the US &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot; and No. 1 in Canada. The B-side &quot;You Move Me&quot; written by Astley was featured in the movie &quot;Cocktail&quot;.

Production of the singer&#x27;s follow up album was complicated when a distressed Astley rejected the set&#x27;s intended first single, &quot;Nothing Can Divide Us&quot;‚Äîa track the producers then gave to Jason Donovan. Wishing to placate an unhappy Astley, producer Pete Waterman allowed him to start work with other writers and producers under the PWL umbrella, but a fire in the PWL studios destroyed much of Astley&#x27;s new material, causing a delay in the release of his second album. &quot;Hold Me in Your Arms&quot; was released in January 1989, containing five singles, and reached No. 8 in the UK and No. 19 in the US, with it achieving Platinum and Gold certifications worldwide. &quot;Number One&quot; gave a very enthusiastic review of the album: &quot;We say hoorah! Some pundits say this sounds exactly like Rick&#x27;s last disc, but this isn&#x27;t a bad thing. It just means there&#x27;s more swirling singalongs&quot;. Astley&#x27;s relationship with British media deteriorated significantly after the release of &quot;Hold Me in Your Arms&quot;, with the media calling him a &quot;puppet&quot; of Stock Aitken Waterman, although Astley had written five of his new album&#x27;s tracks. The negative press affected the sales of his singles.

The first single from the album was &quot;She Wants to Dance with Me&quot;, written by Astley. He composed the track in the style of Whitney Houston&#x27;s hit, &quot;I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot; in an effort to win the confidence of Waterman, who was a fan of Houston&#x27;s song. It was another international success, peaking in the Top 10 in many countries, including Canada, where it topped the chart, and the US and the UK, where it reached No. 6. &quot;Take Me to Your Heart&quot; was the next single to be released from the album. It was a success on the UK Singles Chart where it peaked at No. 8 and it was also a Top 10 and 20 hit in many other European countries. It was one of four songs written and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman that were belatedly added to the album in order to help Astley make his release deadline following the fire. The four tracks were written and produced in just two days, with writer Matt Aitken confirming &quot;Take Me to Your Heart&quot; was inspired by house music act Inner City&#x27;s 1988 hit, &quot;Big Fun&quot;.

&quot;Hold Me in Your Arms&quot;, a ballad written by Astley, reached No. 10 in the UK and was also not released in North America. The next two singles released from the album were intended for the North American market. &quot;Giving Up on Love&quot; and a cover of The Temptations song &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot; charted at No. 38 and No. 89 in the US respectively. In December 1989, Astley set off on his first world tour, touring 15 countries including the UK, US, Australia, and Japan. By the end of the tour, he was tired of the negative press and wanted to explore alternative paths as a musician. He left Stock Aitken Waterman and RCA Records bought out his contract with PWL.

===1990‚Äì1993: Switch to adult contemporary and career break===
By 1990, Astley decided to leave dance-pop and move towards soul. The shift in musical genre led him to change his image, ditching the boy next door look, growing his hair, and presenting himself as a mature and passionate musician. His third album, &quot;Free&quot;, was released in 1991 and contained collaborations with Elton John. It had three singles and reached No. 9 in the UK and No. 31 in the US. Astley achieved one more major success with his 1991 ballad &quot;Cry for Help&quot;, which reached No. 7 on both the UK Singles Chart and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also reached No. 4 in Canada and was a No. 1 hit on both the US and Canadian Adult Contemporary charts. The song&#x27;s accompanying music video received heavy rotation on MTV Europe. &quot;Cry for Help&quot; was awarded one of BMI&#x27;s Pop Awards in 1993, honoring the songwriters, composers and music publishers of the song.

The other two singles from &quot;Free&quot; were not as successful; &quot;Move Right Out&quot; reached No. 58 in the UK and No. 81 in the US, and &quot;Never Knew Love&quot; reached No. 70 in the UK and did not chart in the US. &quot;Free&quot; marked the end of Astley&#x27;s successful four-year period, and &quot;Cry for Help&quot; was the last Astley single to make the Top 10 in either the UK or US. Astley&#x27;s next album, &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, was released in 1993 and was largely an Adult Contemporary album. By the time the album was released, Astley had decided to retire from the music industry. As a result, the album did not get much promotion; it did not chart in the UK but managed to make the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at No. 182.

The two singles, &quot;The Ones You Love&quot; and &quot;Hopelessly&quot;, performed very well on the US Adult Contemporary chart, peaking at No. 19 and No. 4 respectively. &quot;The Ones You Love&quot; peaked at No. 48 in the UK but did not chart in the US. &quot;Hopelessly&quot; crossed over and peaked at No. 28 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, staying in the US Top 40 for five weeks, and No. 33 in the UK. It was the last hit to chart on the Top 40 in either the UK or US. It was named as one of the most performed songs at the 1994 BMI Awards, and is one of the few songs to achieve BMI &quot;Million-Air&quot; status.

===1994‚Äì2000: Retirement===
Astley retired from the music industry in 1993 at the age of 27, deciding that family life was more important to him; &quot;Now it doesn&#x27;t seem like any amount of years, but then it was a quarter of my life. I was a young guy and I was like, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to be doing that every single day of my life. I want to hang out with my friends. I&#x27;ve made a lot of money. I want to spend some of it. I want to do the things I want to do.&quot;

During his time out of the music business, his daughter Emilie (born in 1992) grew up. For much of the 1990s and early-2000s, Astley remained out of the public eye. He said later this was due to his growing frustration with the business side of things; he compared his life as a pop star to being &quot;more like a travelling salesman than a musician or performer&quot;. During that period he co-wrote &quot;Mission Statement&quot;, a track for former Marillion singer Fish&#x27;s 1999 solo album &quot;Raingods with Zippos&quot;.

===2000‚Äì2020: Return to singing and renewed success===
Seven years after &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, Astley returned to the music industry, signing a co-publishing deal with Polydor and recording a new album, &quot;Keep It Turned On&quot;, between November 2000 and September 2001, and released in late 2001. The album featured the single &quot;Sleeping&quot;, which became a minor club hit, thanks to a set of remixes from the US house producer Todd Terry. &quot;Keep It Turned On&quot; was only released in Continental Europe. Astley&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, was released in 2002, and reached No. 16 on the UK Albums Chart. With no promotion from him, it sold over 100,000 copies and was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry. In 2003, Astley charted at No. 10 in the UK as a songwriter with &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s (Way With) Words&quot; performed by short-lived boy band One True Voice. In 2004, Astley toured for the first time in fourteen years, which led him to a record contract with Sony BMG.

In March 2005, Astley released the album &quot;Portrait&quot;, in which he covered many classic standards such as &quot;Vincent&quot;, &quot;Nature Boy&quot; and &quot;Close to You&quot;. Astley and Sony BMG were unhappy with the result, so the album was poorly promoted, yet it managed to reach No. 26 on the UK Albums Chart. In April 2008, the album &quot;The Ultimate Collection: Rick Astley&quot; was released by Sony BMG, and by May it had reached No. 17 on the UK Top 40 Albums Chart, again with no promotion by Astley.

In September 2008, Astley was nominated for the &quot;Best Act Ever&quot; award at the MTV Europe Music Awards. The push to make him the winner of the award continued after the announcement, as did efforts to encourage MTV to invite Astley to the awards ceremony. On 7 November, following a massive Internet campaign by fans, Astley won the award in Liverpool but was not there in person to receive it. Perez Hilton collected the prize on his behalf. On the back of this, &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; (which had recently become an Internet meme via Rickrolling) returned to the UK charts, peaking at No. 73 during the Christmas period. Astley continued touring across the globe and, in 2008, performed in the &quot;Here and Now Tour&quot; which featured various other 1980s acts such as Boy George and Belinda Carlisle. In April 2009, he wrote an article for &quot;Time&quot; about moot.

Astley was a special guest throughout Peter Kay&#x27;s new tour, &quot;The Tour That Doesn&#x27;t Tour Tour...Now On Tour&quot;, from 27 April to 22 May 2010. To mark the occasion, Astley released a new single, &quot;Lights Out&quot;, on his own label on 7 June 2010. It was his first release in the UK Singles Chart in seventeen years. It was well received by radio, peaking at No. 15 on the UK Airplay Charts, but failed to become a commercial hit, reaching only No. 97 on the UK Singles Chart.

During the summer of 2010, Astley became a radio DJ for London&#x27;s Magic FM, presenting a Sunday show. The initial contract was for eight weeks, but he proved popular with listeners and his contract was extended till the end of the year. In December 2010, Astley co-hosted the &quot;Chris Evans Breakfast Show&quot; on BBC Radio 2 with Peter Kay, and in March 2011 appeared in Comic Relief&#x27;s Red Nose Day telethon on the BBC.

In April 2016, Astley released &quot;Keep Singing&quot;, from his forthcoming album &quot;50&quot; which was released on 10 June 2016 by BMG. Interviewed by Amanda Holden on the &quot;Lorraine&quot; show on 7 April, Astley explained that turning 50 had prompted him to release the single. He said, &quot;It was a big milestone. I got back in the studio and friends were telling me the material I was working on was pretty good. So I decided to go for it.&quot; The album reached No. 1 on the Official UK Album Sales charts in the week of 17 June to 23 June 2016. On 30 June 2017, Astley announced on his Twitter account that &quot;50&quot; had been certified Platinum in the United Kingdom (300,000 and more albums sold).

In September 2016, Astley released the single &quot;Dance&quot;, together with an official video. On 1 June 2018, Astley posted a video on Twitter announcing his upcoming album &quot;Beautiful Life&quot; which was released on 13 July. Astley did a tour, the &quot;#BeautifulLife Tour&quot;, and tickets were first available for purchase to anyone who pre-ordered the album. &quot;Beautiful Life&quot; peaked at No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. In 2019, Astley served as the support act on Take That&#x27;s Greatest Hits Live 38-date tour in Britain and Ireland. He is also an occasional guest vocalist at Foo Fighters concerts, and has previously performed with A-ha and Kylie Minogue.

Astley and the Foo Fighters both performed at the Summer Sonic Festival in Japan. The band invited Astley to join them as they performed the &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; in the style of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. Astley and Foo Fighters leader Dave Grohl became friends and he performed with the band at the California Jam rock festival.

During live performances where he sings &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;, Astley sometimes shouts out to the audience that he is feeling &quot;bloody marvellous&quot; or that he is feeling &quot;fantastic&quot; to have some banter with the audience. On 12 October 2019, Astley appeared on &quot;CBeebies Bedtime Stories&quot;. On 25 October, he released a greatest hits album album, &quot;The Best of Me&quot;. The album includes the single &quot;Every One of Us&quot;, which was released in September 2019. &quot;The Best of Me&quot; reached No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 1 on the UK Independent Albums chart.

=== 2020‚Äìpresent: Covers and &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot; ===
In June 2020, towards the end of the nationwide lockdown in England due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Astley released four cover songs: &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot; by Bill Withers, &quot;Everlong&quot; by Foo Fighters, &quot;Titanium&quot; by David Guetta, and &quot;Better Now&quot; by Post Malone. Around that time, Astley made a TikTok account, launching it with a video of him dancing to &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; which received millions of views. On 30 November 2020, Astley released a single, &quot;Love This Christmas&quot;, the video featuring Astley performing amid a flurry of snow and dancing snowmen. To accompany the single, he launched a signed limited edition Christmas card, with all proceeds going to the Shooting Stars Children&#x27;s Hospices. On 7 April 2021, Astley released a single, &quot;Unwanted&quot;, inspired by the era and vibes of the original podcast.

On 2 September 2021, amid the news that ABBA had reunited, Astley released a cover of their song &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot;. That month, he and the band Blossoms performed two concerts of covers by the Smiths, who had disbanded in the 1980s. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Guardian&quot; gave one performance four out of five, writing that &quot;the ultimate Smiths karaoke shouldn&#x27;t work, but it does&quot;. Astley and Blossoms performed again at the 2023 Glastonbury Festival. The &quot;Guardian&quot; gave the performances positive reviews, suggesting that they offered fans a way to enjoy the Smiths without the &quot;moral queasiness&quot; of the Smiths singer, Morrissey, who had become a controversial figure in the preceding years. Astley said he performed &quot;from a place of absolute joy and love for those songs&quot;. He also played a solo set at Glastonbury that year, his first appearance there.

Morrissey thanked Blossoms and Astley on his website, writing: &quot;Anything that generates interest in that tired old Smiths warhorse is testimony to the wallop it packed.&quot; Marr described the performances as &quot;funny and horrible at the same time&quot; and said he had not been informed they were happening. He said later he had &quot;dealt with it&quot;. In response to Marr, Astley said: &quot;It&#x27;s his work and his life, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like [the Smiths] are ever getting back together ... It&#x27;s a difficult one, but I did it from a place of absolute joy and love for those songs.&quot;

In October 2023, Astley released &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot;, his first album of new music since 2018&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful Life&quot;. Inspired by soul music, it debuted at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart. Astley&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Never: The Autobiography&quot;, was released on 10 October 2024. The book received positive reviews from critics with John Aizlewood from &quot;i&quot; calling it a &quot;nuanced memoir&quot; and a &quot;revelation&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 2007, Astley became the subject of a viral Internet meme known as rickrolling. The meme is a type of bait and switch using a disguised hyperlink that leads to the &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; music video. When victims click on a seemingly unrelated link, the site with the music video loads instead of what was expected and in doing so they are said to have been &quot;rickrolled&quot;. The meme has also extended to using the song&#x27;s lyrics in unexpected places. The meme gained mainstream attention in 2008 through several publicized events, particularly when YouTube used it on its 2008 April Fools&#x27; Day event. Rickrolling saw a massive resurgence online in the early 2020s. In online classes on Zoom during the worldwide COVID-19 lockdown, students often rickrolled their classmates and teachers. A 4K remaster of the &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; music video went viral in early 2021.

Initially, Astley, who had only recently returned to performing after a 10-year hiatus, was hesitant about using his newfound popularity from the meme to further his career, but accepted the fame when he rickrolled the 2008 Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade with a surprise performance of the song. Since then, he has seen his performance career revitalised by the meme&#x27;s popularity. In an interview, Astley stated that one of his favourite rickroll videos is &quot;BarackRoll&quot;, a rickroll featuring clips from rallies by Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign, edited to make it look as though he is singing &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;.

Astley himself has been rickrolled a few times; the first time pre-dated the viral phenomenon. In an interview with Larry King, Astley says that the first time he fell for the prank was through an email his friend sent him during the early 2000s. On a Reddit post in June 2020, a user claimed to have met Astley backstage when they were 12-years-old, but the user posted a link to the song instead of a picture verifying the encounter. Astley later confirmed he had been tricked into clicking the link. The post became the most upvoted post of 2020 on Reddit.

==Personal life==
Astley has been married to film producer Lene Bausager since 2003. They met when she was working as a promoter with RCA in 1987, and she is now a film producer. Their daughter, whom Astley never let meet his father, has a master&#x27;s degree in fine art and is a garden designer. Astley and his wife live in the Surrey town of Molesey and their daughter lives in Denmark. He maintains a home recording studio and has a collection of guitars.

In 2017, Astley partnered with Mikkeller, a Danish brewery, opening two pubs over the following years in Islington and Shoreditch, London. In January 2023, Astley sued Yung Gravy over vocal imitations on Gravy&#x27;s song &quot;Betty (Get Money)&quot;. Astley asserted that it was a violation of his &quot;right of publicity&quot;, and the case was settled in September 2023. Also in 2023, Astley said on &quot;This Morning&quot; that he is experiencing hearing loss and now wearing hearing aids.

<text>HMS &quot;Cardiff&quot; was a C-class light cruiser built for the Royal Navy during World War I. She was one of the five ships of the &quot;Ceres&quot; sub-class and spent most of her career as a flagship. Assigned to the Grand Fleet during the war, the ship participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in late 1917. &quot;Cardiff&quot; was briefly deployed to the Baltic in late 1918 supporting anti-Bolshevik forces during the British campaign in the Baltic during the Russian Civil War.

She was then transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1919 and spent most of the rest of the year in the Adriatic Sea. In early 1920, the ship was in the Black Sea supporting the Whites against the Bolsheviks. &quot;Cardiff&quot; spent most of the rest of her time between the world wars overseas or in reserve. The ship played a minor role in World War II as she was initially assigned to the Northern Patrol, but became a training ship in late 1940 and continued in that role for the rest of the war. &quot;Cardiff&quot; was sold for scrap in early 1946 and subsequently broken up.

==Design and description==
The C-class cruisers were intended to escort the fleet and defend it against enemy destroyers attempting to close within torpedo range. The &quot;Ceres&quot; sub-class was a slightly larger and improved version of the preceding &quot;Caledon&quot; sub-class. The ships were long overall, with a beam of and a mean draught of . Displacement was at normal and at deep load. &quot;Cardiff&quot; was powered by two geared Parsons steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, which produced a total of . The turbines used steam generated by six Yarrow boilers which gave her a speed of about . She carried tons of fuel oil. The ship had a crew of about 460 officers and ratings.

The main armament of the &quot;Ceres&quot;-class ships consisted of five BL 6-inch (152¬†mm) Mk XII guns that were mounted on the centreline. While identical in number to the &quot;Caledon&quot;s, the layout was considerably improved by moving the gun formerly between the bridge and fore funnel to a superfiring position over the forward gun with wider firing arc than in its old position, one was aft of the rear funnel, and the last two were in the stern, with one gun superfiring over the rearmost gun. The two QF 20-cwt anti-aircraft (AA) guns were positioned abreast the fore funnel. The torpedo armament of the &quot;Ceres&quot;‚Ä≥s was identical to that of the &quot;Caledon&quot;s, with eight  torpedo tubes in four twin mounts, two on each broadside. The &quot;Ceres&quot; class was protected by a waterline belt: thick and had a protective deck that was thick over the steering gear. The walls of the conning tower had a thickness of 3 inches.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Cardiff&quot;, the second ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy, was ordered in March‚ÄìApril 1916 as part of the Repeat War Programme. The ship was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at their Govan shipyard on 22 July 1916. She was launched on 12 April 1917 and completed on 25 June 1917. She became flagship of the 6th Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet the following month. &quot;Cardiff&quot; participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917. This was a successful attempt by the British to intercept German minesweeping forces that were clearing British minefields in the North Sea. The 6th LCS screened the two light s of the 1st Cruiser Squadron during the battle together with the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron. The British lost the German minesweepers in the smoke screen laid by the four German light cruisers and pursued the latter ships for most of the battle, although they inflicted little damage in the poor visibility caused by the German smoke. &quot;Cardiff&quot; fired the most of any ship in her squadron, but did not hit any German ships. She was, however, hit four or five times herself, killing seven crewmen and wounding thirteen, but was only lightly damaged. Based at Scapa Flow and Rosyth during 1918, the ship spent the remainder of the war escorting convoys and training in the northern portion of the North Sea. By 21 November 1918 the war was over, and &quot;Cardiff&quot; had the honour of leading the German High Seas Fleet to the Firth of Forth to be interned.
A few days later, the 6th LCS, under the command of Rear-Admiral Edwyn Alexander-Sinclair, was ordered to the Baltic Sea to support the Baltic States as they attempted to secure their independence from Russia. Together with her half-sister and five destroyers, the ship bombarded Bolshevik positions east of Reval (Tallinn), Estonia, on 14 December and brought the Russian offensive to a halt after they destroyed the one bridge connecting them with Petrograd (Saint Petersburg), Russia. The next day, her starboard AA gun was dismounted and given to the Estonians. The 6th LCS was recalled in early January 1919 and arrived back in Rosyth on 10 January.

&quot;Cardiff&quot; arrived at Portsmouth on 11 January to begin a refit that lasted until 27 February. Her conning tower may have been removed at this time and the bridge enlarged. On 10 March, she sailed for Malta to join her squadron, which had been renumbered as the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron (3rd LCS) and assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet while the ship was refitting, where she arrived on six days later. The squadron was assigned peacekeeping duties in the Adriatic for most of 1919 and &quot;Cardiff&quot; spent the time visiting various Adriatic ports or in Malta. She became the flagship of Rear-Admiral George Hope on 1 September.

By 30 January 1920, the ship was in Constantinople and &quot;Cardiff&quot; arrived at Odessa on 4 February and Admiral Hope concurred in the decision to evacuate the city in the face of the advancing Bolsheviks. The ship departed the city the next day, but returned on 11 February and Hope assumed command of all British forces in the city. By late March, the ship was stationed in the Crimea until the Whites were forced to evacuate in November. On 6 November, &quot;Cardiff&quot; picked up Charles I of Austria, the last Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, and his wife, Zita at Sulina, Romania, and conveyed them to their exile in the Portuguese island of Madeira, where they arrived on 19 November. The ship was present during the Great Fire of Smyrna almost a year later in mid-September 1922, close to the end of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919‚Äì1922. She remained in the Mediterranean until 1929 when she went home for a lengthy refit. During &quot;Cardiff&quot;‚Ä≥s time in the Mediterranean, she was fitted with a pair of 2-pounder (40¬†mm) Mk II &quot;pom-pom&quot; AA guns in 1923‚Äì24 and her original rangefinders was exchanged for models during the mid-1920s. From 1931 to May 1933, she was assigned to the Commander-in-Chief, Africa as the flagship of the 6th Cruiser Squadron. The ship returned home that month and replaced her half-sister as flagship of the Nore Reserve in July. The following year, she was transferred to the Chatham Reserve as their flagship and participated in the Silver Jubilee Fleet review for King George V on 16 July 1935. &quot;Cardiff&quot; was also present for the Coronation Fleet Review for King George VI on 20 May 1937. The ship was considered for conversion into an anti-aircraft cruiser in June 1938, but programme delays caused the conversion to be pushed back. A month later, &quot;Cardiff&quot; was recommissioned for service with the 5th Cruiser Squadron on the China Station. The ship departed Hong Kong on 29 April 1939 for the UK where she was again placed in reserve.

===Second World War===
On the first day of the war on 3 September 1939, &quot;Cardiff&quot; was assigned to the 12th Cruiser Squadron which was fruitlessly searching for returning German merchant ships in the North and Norwegian Seas. Several days later, she was assigned to patrol the gaps between the Shetland and Faeroe Islands and between the Faeroes and Iceland as part of the Northern Patrol. In late November, she fruitlessly searched for the German battleships and after they sank the armed merchant cruiser, , on the 23rd. On 12 June, &quot;Cardiff&quot; was tasked to suppress the German artillery batteries overlooking Saint-Valery-en-Caux to prevent them from firing on British ships as they evacuated the troops there, but they were no longer visible from the sea when the ship arrived. The cruiser received six wounded men from the coaster &quot;Cameo&quot; and returned to Portsmouth. &quot;Cardiff&quot; was converted for use as a gunnery training ship in October and served in that capacity for the rest of the war. The ship was fitted with six Oerlikon light AA guns and a Type 290 surface-search radar by April 1942. By late 1943 a Type 273 long-range search radar had also been fitted. &quot;Cardiff&quot; was paid off on 3 September 1945 and sold for scrap to Arnott Young on 23 January 1946. The ship was broken up in Dalmuir, Scotland, after she arrived there on 18 March.

<text>Peter Riedel (August 1905 ‚Äì November 6, 1998) was a German gliding champion, and served as air attach√© for the Nazi government in Washington, D.C., before and during World War II. Between 1977 and 1985, he published the definitive history of the German gliding movement prior to the war.

Riedel was born in Dehlitz, Saxony. His father was a Lutheran pastor and his mother was a professor of theology at the University of Halle. Due to his father&#x27;s bouts of mental illness, and his mother&#x27;s suicide, Riedel was raised for some time by an uncle.

In 1920, at the age of 15, Riedel attended the first gliding championship held at the Wasserkuppe, taking with him a half-built glider of his own design, which he completed and flew with the help of other attendees at the meet. From then on, he became a regular participant at the competitions. With the assistance of philanthropist , who had taken an interest in the gliding movement, Riedel was able to attend the Darmstadt University of Technology, where he studied engineering. After graduation, he trained as a commercial pilot, but could not find work, and instead spent six years working under at the &quot;Deutsche Forschungsanstalt f√ºr Segelflug&quot; (DFS - German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight). In the meantime, he continued competitive gliding, setting a world distance record of in 1933 and winning the Hindenburg Cup at the Wasserkuppe competition the same year. In 1934, he accompanied Professor Georgii on a tour of Brazil and Argentina to help promote the sport in Latin America, along with Wolf Hirth and Heini Dittmar. While in Argentina, Riedel set a record for long-distance soaring. Hanna Reitsch also went, and the two became good friends.

Later that year, Riedel finally found work as a commercial pilot, and flew for Deutsche Luft Hansa for two years, then accepting a two-year contract with SCADTA, an airline from Colombia, not intending to return to Germany. In 1937, he competed in the Soaring Society of America&#x27;s national competition. While in the U.S., he was approached by the German Military Attach√© and offered a post in Washington, DC, which he accepted and took up in June 1938. His work involved gathering intelligence on U.S. air activities and reporting to Berlin. In time, he was made a commissioned officer of the Luftwaffe and given the official position of Air Attach√©.

In July 1938, during the 9th Annual American Soaring Contest, Riedel -flying a two-place German sailplane of German make with Dr. Karl O. Lange, the contest director, as his passenger- landed in Mohawk Flats near Utica, New York four hours after having taken off from Elmira, New York.

When the United States entered the war, Riedel was interned along with the rest of the German embassy staff. He was returned to Germany as part of a diplomatic exchange. His wife, Helen Klug, a native of Terre Haute, Indiana and a US citizen, agreed to join him. On his return, the Heinkel company employed him as an engineer, but he soon took up another diplomatic post as Air Attach√© to Sweden. There, he became aware of the atrocities of the Nazi regime from reports in both the US and Soviet press. Horrified, he began to deal directly with the US Office of Strategic Services but was betrayed by a friend and recalled to Berlin. Guessing what fate might have awaited him there, he instead went into hiding in Sweden. After the war, he was arrested as an illegal alien but escaped after some time in custody and fled to Venezuela, where Helen eventually joined him.

Over the next few years, they lived and worked in Canada and South Africa, until they could finally return to settle in the U.S., where Riedel flew for TWA and Pan Am. For a while, they resided in Terre Haute, where he worked for the Reich Manufacturing Company.

In his retirement, Riedel wrote an extensive and detailed history, in three volumes, of the German gliding movement between 1911 and 1937, titled &quot;Erlebte Rh√∂ngeschichte&quot;. Shortly before his death, &quot;German Air Attach√©&quot;, a biography, was published. Riedel is interred at Calvary Cemetery in Terre Haute.

<text>Alnus rubra, the red alder,
is a deciduous broadleaf tree native to western North America (Alaska, Yukon, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho and Montana).

==Description==
&quot;Alnus rubra&quot; is the largest species of alder in North America and one of the largest in the world, reaching heights of . The official tallest red alder (as of 1979) stands tall in Clatsop County, Oregon (US). The trunks range from in diameter. The bark is mottled, ashy-gray and smooth, often colonized by white lichen and moss. The leaves are ovate, long, with bluntly serrated edges and a distinct point at the end; the leaf margin is revolute, the very edge being curled under, a diagnostic character which distinguishes it from all other alders. Rather than turning yellow in autumn, its leaves darken in colour and wither before they are shed. The male flowers are dangling reddish catkins long in early spring. Female flowers occur in clusters of (3) 4‚Äì6 (8). Female catkins are erect during anthesis, but otherwise pendant. They develop into small, woody, superficially cone-like oval dry fruit long. The seeds develop between the woody bracts of the &#x27;cones&#x27; and are shed in late autumn and winter. Red alder seeds have a membranous winged margin that allows long-distance dispersal.

Specimens can live to about 60 years of age before being seriously afflicted by heart rot.

==Taxonomy==
The name derives from the bright rusty red color that develops in bruised or scraped bark.

==Distribution==
&quot;Alnus rubra&quot; grows from Southeast Alaska to central coastal California, nearly always within about of the Pacific coast, except for an extension inland across Washington and Oregon into northernmost Montana. It can be found from sea level to elevations of .

==Ecology==
In southern Alaska, western British Columbia and the northwestern Pacific Coast Ranges of the United States, red alder grows on cool and moist slopes; inland and at the southern end of its range (California) it grows mostly along the margins of watercourses and wetlands. It is shade intolerant.

In moist forest areas, &quot;Alnus rubra&quot; will rapidly cover a former burn or clearcut, often preventing the establishment of conifers. It is a prolific seed producer, but the small, wind-dispersed seeds require an open area of mineral soil to germinate, and so skid trails and other areas disturbed by logging or fire are ideal seedbeds. Such areas may host several hundred thousand to several million seedlings per hectare in the first year after landscape disturbance.

Twigs and buds of alder are only fair browse for wildlife, but deer and elk browse the twigs in fall and twigs and buds in the winter and spring. Beaver occasionally eat the bark, though it is not a preferred species. Several finches eat alder seeds, notably common redpoll and pine siskin, and as do deer mice. Tent caterpillars often feed on the leaves, but the trees usually recover within a year.

The tree hosts the nitrogen-fixing actinomycete &quot;Frankia&quot; in nodules on roots. This association allows alder to grow in nitrogen-poor soils, and makes the species an important early colonizer of disturbed forests and riparian areas. This self-fertilizing trait allows red alder to grow rapidly, and makes it effective in covering disturbed and/or degraded land, such as mine spoils. Imported Red Alder has been found to be able to make successful associations with Frankia strains present in the UK. Alder leaves, shed in the fall, decay readily to form a nitrogen-enriched humus making the nitrogen available to other species.

===Common associates===
Red alder is associated with coast Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; subsp. &quot;menziesii&quot;), western hemlock (&quot;Tsuga heterophylla&quot;), grand fir (&quot;Abies grandis&quot;), western redcedar (&quot;Thuja plicata&quot;), and Sitka spruce (&quot;Picea sitchensis&quot;) forests.

Along stream banks, it is commonly associated with willows (&quot;Salix&quot; spp.), red osier dogwood (&quot;Cornus stolonifera&quot;), Oregon ash (&quot;Fraxinus latifolia&quot;), and bigleaf maple (&quot;Acer macrophyllum&quot;).

To the southeast of its range it is replaced by white alder (&quot;Alnus rhombifolia&quot;), which is a tree of similar stature, but which differs in the leaf margins not being rolled under, lack of distinct lobes, and lack of membranous wings on seed margins. In the high mountains it is replaced by the smaller and more shrub-like Sitka alder (&quot;Alnus viridis&quot; subsp. &quot;sinuata&quot;), and east of the Cascade Mountains by thinleaf alder (&quot;Alnus incana&quot; subsp. &quot;tenuifolia&quot;).

==Uses==

===As dye===
A russet dye can be made from a decoction of the bark, apparently due to the tannin it contains, and was used by Native Americans to dye fishing nets so as to make them less visible underwater.

===Medicine===
Native Americans used red alder bark to treat poison oak reactions, insect bites, and skin irritations. Blackfeet Indians used an infusion made from the bark of red alder to treat lymphatic disorders and tuberculosis. Recent clinical studies have verified that red alder contains betulin and lupeol, compounds shown to be effective against a variety of tumors.

===Restoration===
In addition to its use as a nitrogen fixer, red alder is occasionally used as a rotation crop to discourage the conifer root pathogen &quot;Phellinus weirii&quot; (causing laminated root rot).

&quot;Alnus rubra&quot; are occasionally planted as ornamental trees and will do well in Swales, riparian areas, or on stream banks, in light-textured soils that drain well. Red alder does not thrive in heavy, wet clay soils. If planted domestically, alders should be planted well away from drainpipes, sewage pipes, and water lines, as the roots may invade and clog the lines.

===Woodworking===
Alder lumber is not considered to be a durable option for outdoor applications, but due to its workability and ease of finishing it is increasingly used for furniture and cabinetry. Because it is softer than other popular hardwoods such as maple, walnut and ash, alder has historically been considered of low value for timber. However it is now becoming one of the more popular hardwood alternatives as it is economically priced compared to other hardwoods. In the world of musical instrument construction, red alder is valued by some electric guitar / electric bass builders for its balanced tonality. Alder is frequently used by Native Americans for making masks, bowls, tool handles, and other small goods.

The appearance of alder lumber ranges from white through pinkish to light brown, has a relatively soft texture, minimal grain, and has medium luster. It is easily worked, glues well, and takes a good finish.

===Fish smoking===
Because of its oily smoke, &quot;A. rubra&quot; is the wood of choice for smoking salmon.

===As an environmental indicator===
Red alder is often used by scientists as a biomonitoring organism to locate areas prone to ozone pollution, as the leaves react to the presence of high ozone levels by developing red to brown or purple discolorations.

=== Forestry ===

With a current inventory of about , red alder comprises 60% of the total hardwood volume in the Pacific Northwest, and is by far the most valuable hardwood in term of diversity of products, commercial value, and manufacturing employment. Increasing value of alder logs, combined with a better understanding of the species&#x27; ecological role, has led some land managers to tolerate and, in some cases, manage for alder.

As an &quot;aggressive pioneer&quot; that was freely able to rapidly colonise areas to the detriment of the more valuable conifer species, it was regarded for a long time as a weed and was neglected for its timber potential, however breeding programmes to improve stem form and timber quality are now underway.

Since most forest land in the Northwest is managed for conifer production, over of timberland are sprayed with herbicides annually in Oregon alone to control red alder and other competing hardwood species. Red alder&#x27;s rapid early growth can interfere with establishment of conifer plantations. Herbicide spraying of red alder over large areas of coastal Oregon and Washington has resulted in a number of lawsuits claiming it has caused health problems, including birth defects and other human health effects.

In addition to adding soil nitrogen, rotations of red alder are used to reduce laminated root rot in Douglas-fir forests. Nurse stands of red alder may also reduce spruce weevil damage in Sitka spruce stands on the Olympic Peninsula. Alder continues to attract interest as log values approach and often exceed those of Douglas-fir. This interest is limited by red alder&#x27;s total stand productivity, which is significantly lower than that of Douglas-fir and western hemlock.

<text>The Territory of Kansas was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from May 30, 1854, until January 29, 1861, when the eastern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the free state of Kansas. The territory extended from the Missouri border west to the summit of the Rocky Mountains and from the 37th parallel north to the 40th parallel north. Originally part of Missouri Territory, it was unorganized from 1821 to 1854. Much of the eastern region of what is now the State of Colorado was part of Kansas Territory. The Territory of Colorado was created to govern this western region of the former Kansas Territory on February 28, 1861.

The question of whether Kansas was to be a free or a slave state was, according to the Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act, to be decided by popular sovereignty, that is, by vote of the Kansans. The question of which Kansans were eligible to vote led to an armed-conflict period called Bleeding Kansas. Both pro-slavery and free-state partisans encouraged and sometimes financially supported emigration to Kansas, so as to influence the vote. During part of the territorial period there were two territorial legislatures, with two constitutions, meeting in two cities (one capital was burned by partisans of the other capital). Two applications for statehood, one free and one slave, were sent to the U.S. Congress. The departure of Southern legislators in January 1861 facilitated Kansas&#x27; entry as a free state, later the same month.

==Missouri Territory==

From June 4, 1812, until August 10, 1821, the area that would become Kansas Territory 33 years later was part of the Missouri Territory. When Missouri was granted statehood in 1821 the area became unorganized territory and contained little to no permanent white settlement with the exception of Fort Leavenworth. The Fort was established in 1827 by Henry Leavenworth with the 3rd U.S. Infantry from St. Louis, Missouri; it is the first permanent European settlement in Kansas. The fort was established as the westernmost outpost of the American military to protect trade along the Santa Fe Trail from Native Americans. The trade came from the East, by land using the Boone&#x27;s Lick Road, or by water via the Missouri River. This area, called the Boonslick, was located due east in west-central Missouri and was settled by Upland Southerners from Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee as early as 1812. Its slave-holding population would contrast with settlers from New England who would eventually arrive in the 1850s.
The land that would become Kansas Territory was considered to be infertile by 19th century American pioneers. It was called the Great American Desert, for it lacked trees and was drier than land eastward. Technically, it was part of the vast grasslands that make up the North American Great Plains and supported giant herds of American bison. After the invention of the steel plow and more sophisticated irrigation methods the thick prairie soil would be broken for agriculture. By the 1850s immigration pressure was increasing and organization into a Territory was desired.

== Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act ==

Kansas Territory was established on May 30, 1854, by the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act. This act established both the Nebraska Territory and Kansas Territory. The most momentous provision of the Act in effect repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and allowed the settlers of Kansas Territory to determine by popular sovereignty whether Kansas would be a free state or a slave state.

The Act contained thirty-seven sections. The provisions relating to Kansas Territory were embodied in the last eighteen sections. Some of the more notable sections were:

:;Section 19
::Defines the boundaries of the Territory, gives it the name of Kansas, and prescribes that &quot;when admitted as a State or States, the said Territory, or any portion of the same, shall be received into the Union with or without slavery, as their constitution may prescribe at the time of their admission.&quot; It further provides for its future division into two or more Territories, and the attaching of any portion thereof to any other State or Territory; and for the holding inviolable the rights of all Indian tribes until such time as they shall be extinguished by treaty.

:;Section 28
::Declares the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 to be in full force in the Territory.

:;Section 31
::Locates the seat of government of the Territory, temporarily at Fort Leavenworth, and authorizes the use for public purposes of the government buildings.
:;Section 37
::Declares all treaties, laws and other engagements made by the United States Government, with the Indian tribes inhabiting the Territory, to remain inviolate, notwithstanding anything contained in the provisions of this act.

==Eastern emigration==
=== Pro-slavery settlers ===
Within a few days after the passage of the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act, hundreds of Missourians crossed into the adjacent territory, selected a section of land, and then united with fellow-adventurers in a meeting or meetings, intending to establish a pro-slavery preemption upon all this region.

As early as June 10, 1854, the Missourians held a meeting at Salt Creek Valley, a trading post west from Fort Leavenworth, at which a &quot;Squatter&#x27;s Claim Association&quot; was organized. They said they were in favor of making Kansas a slave state if it should require half the citizens of Missouri, musket in hand, to emigrate there. According to these emigrants, abolitionists would do well not to stop in Kansas Territory, but keep on up the Missouri River until they reach Nebraska Territory, which was anticipated to be a free state. Before the first arrival of Free-State emigrants from the northern and eastern States, nearly every desirable location along the Missouri River had been claimed by men from western Missouri, by virtue of the preemption laws.

=== Free staters ===
During the long debate that preceded the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, it had become the settled opinion at the North that the only remaining means whereby the territory might yet be rescued from the grasp of the slave power, was in its immediate occupancy and settlement by anti-slavery emigrants from the free states in sufficient numbers to establish free institutions within its borders. The desire to facilitate the colonization of the Territory took practical shape while the bill was still under debate in the United States Congress. The largest organization created for this purpose was the New England Emigrant Aid Company, organized by Eli Thayer.

Emigration from the free states (including Iowa, Ohio, and other Midwestern and New England states), flowed into the territory beginning in 1854. These emigrants were known as Free-Staters. Because Missourians had claimed much of the land closest to the border, the Free-Staters were forced to establish settlements further into Kansas Territory. Among these were Lawrence, Topeka, and Manhattan.

To protect themselves against the encroachments of non-residents, the &quot;Actual Settlers&#x27; Association of Kansas Territory&quot; was formed. This association held a meeting on August 12, 1854, the object being the adoption of some regulations that should afford protection to the Free-State settlers, under laws not unlike those adopted by the pro-slavery squatters in the border region east.

==First Territorial appointments==
The first territorial appointments, looking to the inauguration of a local government, under the provisions of the organic law, were made in June and July 1854. The officers appointed by President Pierce, whose appointments were confirmed by the United States Senate, and who entered upon the duties of their office. The first governor was Andrew Horatio Reeder (of Easton, Pennsylvania) was appointed June 29, 1854 and removed July 28, 1858.

==Election of Territorial Legislature==

On March 30, 1855, &quot;Border Ruffians&quot; from Missouri entered Kansas during the territory&#x27;s first legislative election and voted in a pro-slavery Territorial Legislature. Antislavery candidates prevailed in one election district, the future Riley County.

The first session of the legislature was held in Pawnee, Kansas (within the boundary of modern-day Fort Riley), at the request of Governor Reeder. The two-story stone building still stands and is open to the public, as the First Territorial Capitol of Kansas. The building remained as the seat of the legislature for five days from July 2‚Äì6, 1855, then moved nearer Missouri to the Shawnee Methodist Mission.

In the election of 1857, free-staters out-voted the pro-slavery settlers in the Territory, which meant that the Territorial Legislature fell into free-state hands. Then, on October 4, 1859, the Wyandotte Constitution was approved in a referendum by a vote of 10,421 to 5,530, and after its approval by the U.S. Congress, Kansas was admitted as a free state on January 29, 1861, shortly after the Southern legislators, who would never have permitted a new free state, had walked out. The last legislative act of the Territorial Legislature was the approval of the charter for the College of the Sisters of Bethany. This was February 2, 1861‚Äîfour days after James Buchanan signed the act of Congress that officially brought Kansas into the Union.

== Bleeding Kansas ==
James H. Lane joined the Free-State movement in 1855 and became president of the Topeka Constitutional Convention, which met from October 23 to November 11, 1855. He was later a leader of &quot;Jayhawkers.&quot; The first Free-state mass-meeting was in Lawrence on the evening of June 8, 1855; it was stated that persons from Missouri had invaded and had stolen elections to the legislature of the territory.

It was claimed that some Missourians had used violence toward the persons and property of the inhabitants of the Kansas Territory. It was agreed that Kansas should be a free State and that the stolen election was a gross outrage on the elective franchise and rights of freemen and a violation of the principles of popular sovereignty. Those attending did not feel bound to obey any law of illegitimate legislature enacted and opposed the establishment of slavery. The convention reserved the right to invoke the aid of the Federal government against the lawless course of the slavery propaganda in the territory.

<text>The Lecompton Constitution (1858) was the second of four proposed state constitutions of Kansas. Named for the city of Lecompton, Kansas where it was drafted, it was strongly pro-slavery. It never went into effect.

==History==
===Purpose===
The Lecompton Constitution was drafted by pro-slavery advocates and included provisions to protect slavery in the state and to exclude free people of color from its bill of rights. Slavery was the subject of Article 7, which protected the right to enslaved &quot;property&quot;. It prevented the legislature from emancipating enslaved people without their enslavers&#x27; consent and full compensation. A rigged election approved it in December 1857 but overwhelmingly defeated in a second vote in January 1858 by a majority of voters in the Kansas Territory. The rejection of the Lecompton Constitution, and the subsequent admittance of Kansas to the Union as a free state, highlighted the irregular and fraudulent voting practices that had marked earlier efforts by bushwhackers and border ruffians to create a state constitution in Kansas that allowed slavery.

===Predecessors===
The Lecompton Constitution was preceded by the Topeka Constitution and was followed by the Leavenworth and Wyandotte Constitutions, with the Wyandotte becoming the Kansas state constitution. The document was written in response to the anti-slavery position of the 1855 Topeka Constitution of James H. Lane and other free-state advocates. The territorial legislature‚Äîwhich, because of widespread electoral fraud, mainly consisted of enslavers‚Äîmet at the designated capital of Lecompton in September 1857 to produce a rival document. Free-state supporters, who comprised most actual settlers, boycotted the vote. President James Buchanan&#x27;s appointee as territorial governor of Kansas, Robert J. Walker, although a strong defender of slavery, opposed the blatant injustice of the constitution and resigned rather than implement it. This new constitution enshrined slavery in the proposed state and protected the rights of enslavers. In addition, the constitution provided for a referendum on whether to allow more enslaved people to enter the territory.

The Topeka and Lecompton constitutions were placed before the people of the Kansas Territory for a vote, and supporters of the opposing faction boycotted both votes. In the case of Lecompton, however, the vote was boiled down to a single issue, expressed on the ballot as &quot;Constitution with Slavery&quot; v. &quot;Constitution with no Slavery&quot;. But the &quot;Constitution with no Slavery&quot; clause would not have made Kansas a free state; it merely would have banned the future importation of enslaved people into Kansas (something deemed by many as unenforceable). Boycotted by free-soilers, the referendum suffered serious voting irregularities, with over half the 6,000 votes deemed fraudulent. Nevertheless, both it and the Topeka Constitution were sent to Washington for approval by Congress.

===Rejection===

A vocal supporter of enslaver rights, which he believed necessary to prevent Southern secession and preserve the Union, President James Buchanan endorsed the Lecompton Constitution before Congress. While the president received the support of Southern Democrats, many Northern Democrats, led by Stephen A. Douglas, sided with the Republicans in opposition to the constitution. Despite Douglas&#x27;s objections, the Kansas statehood bill passed the Senate on March 23, 1858, by a vote of 33 to 25. Douglas was helped considerably by the work of Thomas Ewing Jr., a noted Kansas Free State politician and lawyer, who led a legislative investigation in Kansas to uncover the fraudulent voting ballots. A new referendum over the fate of the Lecompton Constitution was proposed, even though this would delay Kansas&#x27;s admission to the Union. Furthermore, a new constitution‚Äîthe anti-slavery Leavenworth Constitution‚Äîwas already being drafted. On January 4, 1858, Kansas voters, having the opportunity to reject the constitution altogether in a referendum, overwhelmingly rejected the Lecompton Constitution by a vote of 10,226 to 138. In Washington, the admission of the state of Kansas with the Lecompton Constitution was rejected by the U.S. House of Representatives in 1858. Though soundly defeated, the debate over the proposed constitution had ripped apart the Democratic Party. Anson Burlingame delivered a fiery speech in the House of Representatives on March 31, 1858, condemning those in favor of the Lecompton Constitution as &quot;An Appeal to Patriots Against Fraud and Disunion&quot;. Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state in 1861, just as soon as the pro-slavery senators who had blocked it withdrew from the Senate because their states had seceded.

<doc id="447579" wikidata="Q13156669" url="?curid=447579" title="Kavango Region">
<text>Kavango (before 1998: Okavango) was one of the thirteen regions of Namibia until it was split into the Kavango East and Kavango West Regions in 2013. Its capital was Rundu.

In the north, Kavango bordered the Cuando Cubango Province of Angola, and in the southeast the North-West District of Botswana. Domestically, it bordered the following regions:
*Zambezi ‚Äì east
*Otjozondjupa ‚Äì south
*Oshikoto ‚Äì west
*Ohangwena ‚Äì northwest

Because of its rather higher rainfall than most other parts of Namibia, this region had agricultural potential for the cultivation of a variety of crops, as well as for organised forestry and agro-forestry, which stimulated furniture making and related industries.

Khaudum National Park and Mahango Game Park were located in the region.

== Constituencies ==
Kavango comprised nine constituencies:

* Kahenge
* Kapako
* Mashare
* Mpungu
* Mukwe.
* Ndiyona
* Rundu Rural East
* Rundu Rural West
* Rundu Urban
== Regional elections ==
Electorally, Kavango was consistently dominated by the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO). In the 2004 regional election for the National Assembly of Namibia, SWAPO won all constituencies by a large margin.

== Governors ==
Ambrosius Haingura, a prominent SWAPO organizer during the Namibian War of Independence, served as the region&#x27;s first regional governor from 1993 to 1995. Maurus Nekaro, the governor of the Kavango Region from December 2010, died in office on March 4, 2013. Samuel Mbambo was appointed as Kavango&#x27;s last governor in April 2013.

== Dissolution ==
The Fourth Delimitation Commission of Namibia, responsible for recommending on the country&#x27;s administrative divisions suggested in August 2013 to split the Kavango Region into two. The president Hifikepunye Pohamba enacted the recommendations. As a result, the new regions of Kavango East and Kavango West were created.

==Population==
The region was characterised by an extremely uneven population distribution. The interior is very sparsely inhabited, while the northernmost strip, especially along the Kavango River, has a high population concentration. Largest urban settlements were the capital Rundu and the towns of Nkurenkuru and Divundu.

==Economy and infrastructure==
Kavango was the region with the highest poverty level in Namibia, more than 50% of the population were classified as poor. According to the 2012 Namibia Labour Force Survey, unemployment in the Kavango Region was 29.8% at the time. Economic activities included farming and tourism. Subsistence fishing also played a role in the nutrition of the people residing near the Kavango River.

Kavango had 323 schools with a total of 77,314 pupils.

===Transport===

There was a particular dearth of north-south roads in the Region, apart from the Rundu-Grootfontein main road. Rundu has a small airstrip to accommodate medium-sized tourist or cargo aircraft in daylight only. The poor condition of the roads and the long distances had a negative effect on tourism; this situation was improved by the completion of the Trans‚ÄìCaprivi Highway. A major highway connecting Rundu to western Kavango and the Ohangwena Region is under construction.

<text>Hardap is one of the fourteen regions of Namibia, its capital is Mariental. Hardap contains the municipality of Mariental, the towns Rehoboth and Aranos, and the self-governed villages Gibeon, Gochas, Kalkrand, Stampriet and Maltah√∂he. It is home to the Hardap Dam.

==Geography==

Hardap stretches the entire width of Namibia, from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to Namibia&#x27;s eastern national border. In the northeast, it borders the Kgalagadi District of Botswana, and in the southeast, it borders the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. Domestically, it borders the following regions:
*Erongo ‚Äì northwest
*Khomas ‚Äì north central

* Rehoboth Urban East
* Rehoboth Urban West
* Aranos (created in 2013)
* Daweb (created in 2013)
As in all other regions, SWAPO was by far the strongest political party since Namibian independence. In February 2009, then-governor Hanse-Himarwa was condemned by the National Society for Human Rights of Namibia for declaring Hardap Region &quot;SWAPO territory&quot; and urging supporters not to allow other political parties to &quot;invade&quot; the region.

Four other candidates combined for the 11%.

In the 2004 regional election for the National Assembly of Namibia, SWAPO won all six constituencies.

In the 2015 regional elections SWAPO obtained 65% of the total votes (2010: 60%) and won seven of the eight constituencies with only Rehoboth Urban West narrowly won by the opposition.

<doc id="447585" wikidata="Q573467" url="?curid=447585" title="«ÅKaras Region">
<text>The «ÅKharas Region (pronounced , with a lateral click, former name Karas Region, without the click) is the southernmost, largest, and least densely populated of the 14 regions of Namibia; its capital is Keetmanshoop. The name assigned to the region reflects the prominence of the Karas mountain range in its southern part. The «ÅKharas region contains the municipality of Keetmanshoop, the towns Karasburg, L√ºderitz and Oranjemund, and the self-governed villages Aroab, Berseba, Bethanie, Ko√´s and Tses.

«ÅKharas&#x27; western border is the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. Its location in Namibia&#x27;s south means that it shares a long border in the south and east with the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. Domestically, it borders only the Hardap Region, to the north.

==Politics==

As of 2020, «ÅKharas had 56,352 registered voters. The name of this region was &quot;Karas Region&quot; (without the alveolar lateral click of the Khoekhoegowab language) since Namibian independence in 1990. In an effort to consolidate spelling, it was renamed to &quot;«ÅKharas Region&quot; in October 2015.

===Constituencies===
The region is subdivided into seven electoral constituencies:

* Berseba
* Karasburg East (created 2013 from a split of Karasburg Constituency)
* Karasburg West (created 2013 from a split of Karasburg Constituency)
* Keetmanshoop Rural
* Keetmanshoop Urban
* «ÉNami«ÇN√ªs (&quot;formerly L√ºderitz Constituency&quot;)
* Oranjemund
===Presidential elections===
As in all other regions, SWAPO was by far the strongest political party since Namibian independence. In the 2004 presidential election, the region supported SWAPO&#x27;s Hifikepunye Pohamba with 65% of the votes. No other candidate received more than 10%.

===Regional elections===
In the 2004 regional election for the National Assembly of Namibia, SWAPO won all six constituencies.

In the 2015 regional elections, SWAPO obtained 83% of the total votes (2010: 64%) and won all seven constituencies. In the 2020 regional election the Landless People&#x27;s Movement (LPM, an opposition party formed in 2016) narrowly became the strongest party. It obtained 39% of votes overall and won four of the seven constituencies, SWAPO got 36% and won the remaining three.

===Governors===
* Dawid Boois (2004-)
* Bernadus Swartbooi (until 2015) 
* Lucia Basson (2015‚Äì2020)
* Aletta Fredericks (2020‚Äìpresent)

==Economy and infrastructure==

The region is predominantly a small stock-farming area, the stock mostly consisting of animals such as sheep or goats. Game farming and irrigation farming along the Naute Dam and the Orange River have gained significantly in importance.

Notable places in the region include the harbour town of L√ºderitz and its fishing and boat-building industry, the diamond areas along the coast‚Äîboth on- and off shore‚Äîwith Oranjemund as the main centre, mining enterprises in the southern part of Namibia such as the Haib mine, (Klein Karas area, Rosh Pinah), the Kudu Gas field in the Atlantic Ocean near L√ºderitz, and small-scale industries in L√ºderitz and Keetmanshoop.

The Hot Water Springs at Ai-Ais, the Hot Water Springs in Warmbad, the Kokerboom Forest (Quiver Tree Forest) near Keetmanshoop, the Fish River Canyon (the second-largest in the world), the Brukkaros Mountain (a former volcano) near Berseba, the coastal town L√ºderitz, and several guest and game farms have become important tourist attractions. The tourism industry has the potential for further expansion.

The economic growth potential of the area is considerable, but needs an intensive general development policy. It is a profitable tax-generating area, which predominantly comes from diamond mining for the central government.

The main railway line and two main trunk roads give access to South Africa. Keetmanshoop is considered as the capital of the south and has direct air, railway, and road links with Windhoek. Its airport is of international standards and suitable for international air traffic. There is an airfield at Kolmanskop near L√ºderitz. Well-developed landing facilities also exist at Oranjemund.

«ÅKharas has 49 schools with a total of 20,110 pupils.

<text>HMS &quot;Newcastle&quot; was a member of the &quot;Southampton&quot; subclass of the light cruiser of the Royal Navy.

==Construction==
The first two were ordered from Vickers Armstrong and John Brown &amp; Company on 1 June 1934 as part of the 1933 Construction Programme for the Royal Navy. Vickers laid down its ship, originally to be called &quot;Minotaur&quot;, at their High Walker shipyard on the River Tyne on 4 October 1934. The ship was renamed &quot;Newcastle&quot; later that year. &quot;Newcastle&quot; was launched, in a low-key ceremony owing to the death of King George V three days earlier, on 23 January 1936 by the Duchess of Northumberland. Sea trials, which were disrupted by bad weather, began on 30 November 1936 and continued until 11 December, with a speed of being reached during the eight-hour full power trial. &quot;Newcastle&quot; was accepted by the Royal Navy and commissioned on 5 March 1937.

==Interwar period==
After commissioning, &quot;Newcastle&quot; joined the 2nd Cruiser Squadron, part of the Home Fleet. She took part in the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead in 1937.

==Second World War==

&quot;Newcastle&quot; was under refit on the outbreak of war of the Second World War, joining the newly established 18th Cruiser Squadron on the refit&#x27;s completion. Duties included trade protection duties in the Western Approaches and operation with the Northern Patrol in the waters between Scotland, Iceland and Greenland, enforcing the blockade of Germany by intercepting merchant ships suspected of carrying contraband to Germany.

On 25‚Äì26 September 1939, &quot;Newcastle&quot; sailed with the Home Fleet as it sortied to cover the 2nd Cruiser Squadron which was escorting the submarine , which had been damaged by German trawlers, back to Britain. The covering force came under attack by German bombers, with the battleship hit by a bomb that failed to explode, while air attack against the cruisers of the 18th Cruiser Squadron proving ineffective. On 12 November 1939, &quot;Newcastle&quot; intercepted the German blockade runner in the Denmark Strait. &quot;Parana&quot;‚Ä≥s crew set the German merchant ship on fire before abandoning ship, and &quot;Newcastle&quot; scuttled &quot;Parana&quot; with gunfire the next day. On 23 November 1939, the German battleships and , on a sortie into the North Atlantic, encountered and quickly sank the British armed merchant cruiser of the Northern Patrol. &quot;Newcastle&quot;, the next ship to the west in the British patrol line, responded to &quot;Rawalpindi&quot;‚Ä≥s contact report and attempted to come to &quot;Rawalpindi&quot;‚Ä≥s aid, but when &quot;Newcastle&quot; was spotted by the two German battleships, they broke off attempts to rescue &quot;Rawalpindi&quot;‚Ä≥s crew, and made off at high speed, behind a smoke screen, with &quot;Newcastle&quot;, not yet fitted with radar, soon losing sight of the German ships in a rain squall.

On 23 March 1940, &quot;Newcastle&quot; began a refit on the Tyne which continued until 3 June that year, thus missing the majority of the Norwegian campaign. From 7 July, she was detached to Plymouth to guard against a potential German invasion. On the night of 10/11 October 1940, &quot;Newcastle&quot; provided illumination with star shells while the battleship bombarded the French port of Cherbourg in an attempt to destroy shipping that could be used in a German invasion. On 17 October 1940, &quot;Newcastle&quot; set out from Plymouth with the cruiser and the destroyers , , , and to investigate reports of German destroyers. Later that day, the British force encountered the German destroyers &quot;Hans Lody&quot;, &quot;Friedrich Ihn&quot;, &quot;Erich Steinbrinck&quot; and &quot;Karl Galster&quot;. The German destroyers turned back at full speed making for Brest, with the British force in pursuit. &quot;Newcastle&quot; launched her Walrus seaplane to direct the British force&#x27;s fire, but while &quot;Hans Lody&quot; was hit twice and &quot;Erich Steinbrinck&quot; received splinter damage, the German force escaped to safety in Brest.

On 13 November 1940, &quot;Newcastle&quot; set out for the Mediterranean, carrying 200 RAF personnel and a cargo of aircraft spare parts for Malta, where she arrived on 19 November. &quot;Newcastle&quot;‚Ä≥s next mission was Operation Collar, in which a convoy of merchant ships would be escorted westwards from Alexandria in Egypt to Malta, while more merchant ships would be escorted eastwards from Gibraltar to Malta and Egypt, with the opportunity taken to transfer warships, including &quot;Newcastle&quot; from the Mediterranean to the North Atlantic. On 27 November, the Italian Fleet attempted to intercept the British convoy, resulting in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento.

&quot;Newcastle&quot; was then ordered to the South Atlantic, taking part in an unsuccessful search for the that month. &quot;Newcastle&quot; remained continually at sea from 10 December 1940 to 21 April 1941, a total of 133 days, with 109 days out of sight of land, a record for Royal Navy warships during the Second World War, before a brief refit at Simonstown, South Africa. In May that year, &quot;Newcastle&quot; returned to commerce protection duties in the South Atlantic, and on 18 May 1941, captured the Vichy French merchant ship &quot;Lieutenant Saint Loubert Bie&quot; south of Saint Helena. On 25 July, &quot;Newcastle&quot; intercepted the German blockade runner off the mouth of the River Plate estuary, with &quot;Erlangen&quot; being scuttled by her crew. &quot;Newcastle&quot; continued duties in the South Atlantic until August, when she made passage to the United States for refit.

&quot;Newcastle&quot; was refitted at Boston from September to December 1941, and after returning to Britain on 29 December, was further modified at Devonport dockyard, including revisions to her radar outfit. In February 1942, &quot;Newcastle&quot; left to join the Eastern Fleet, becoming the flagship of the 4th Cruiser Squadron. In June 1942, &quot;Newcastle&quot; was loaned to the Mediterranean Fleet to take part in Operation Vigorous, an attempt to run a convoy from Egypt to Malta at the same time as Operation Harpoon attempted to reach Malta from the West. The Vigorous convoy left Alexandria on 13 July, coming under air attack from 14 July. Early on 15 June, as a result of a sortie of the Italian Fleet, the convoy was ordered to temporarily turn to the east, and while this manoeuvre was underway, the German motor torpedo boat &quot;S-56&quot; took advantage to attack the convoy, hitting &quot;Newcastle&quot; with a single torpedo. The torpedo blew a hole on the starboard side of &quot;Newcastle&quot;‚Ä≥s bow. While the cruiser&#x27;s speed was temporarily reduced to , damage control was successful, and &quot;Newcastle&quot; soon was able to increase speed to , allowing her to keep up with the convoy, while she reached later that day when avoiding the torpedo attack that sank the destroyer . &quot;Newcastle&quot;‚Ä≥s armament was undamaged, and she claimed a share in shooting down four enemy aircraft before the convoy returned to Alexandria on 16 June.

It was decided to repair &quot;Newcastle&quot; at Simonstown, leaving Alexandria on 19 June, and calling in at Aden to reinforce the ship&#x27;s temporary repairs. On 27 June, &quot;Newcastle&quot; encountered heavy weather while crossing the Indian Ocean, with a hole being torn on the port side of the ship&#x27;s bow of similar size to that on the starboard side, and badly damaging the internal structure in the damaged region of the ship. &quot;Newcastle&quot; returned to Aden for more shoring-up of the damaged areas, and underwent further temporary repairs at Bombay, with the holes in the bow being patched over and temporary decks being installed. Permanent repairs were carried out at Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York in October‚ÄìNovember 1942, followed by further modifications at Devonport until March 1943.

After work up at Scapa Flow, &quot;Newcastle&quot; left to rejoin the Eastern Fleet on 15 April 1943, arriving at Kilindini Harbour in Kenya on 27 May, where she resumed her role as the flagship of the 4th Cruiser Squadron. &quot;Newcastle&quot; continued to be employed on commerce protection duties, as well being employed in attempting to intercept supply ships used for the replenishment of German U-boats. In late June 1943, &quot;Newcastle&quot;, together with the cruiser and the destroyers and , was deployed on Operation Player, a search for a U-boat supply ship believed to be operating in the Indian Ocean, but the search proved unsuccessful and was called off on 30 June. &quot;Newcastle&quot; was refitted at Simonstown from 26 August to 17 September 1943, with her anti-aircraft armament being strengthened. In February 1944, &quot;Newcastle&quot;, together with &quot;Relentless&quot; and Catalina flying boats, were deployed in a search for the U-boat supply ship based on intelligence from decrypted radio messages. The British ships found &quot;Charlotte Schliemann&quot; on the night of 11/12 February, and when &quot;Relentless&quot; opened fire, the supply ship&#x27;s crew scuttled her. On 12 March 1944, &quot;Newcastle&quot; together with the escort carrier, , the cruiser and the destroyers and , were sent to intercept the U-boat supply ship &quot;Brake&quot;, again in response to signals intelligence. &quot;Brake&quot; was spotted by aircraft from &quot;Battler&quot;, and &quot;Roebuck&quot; rushed to intercept, with &quot;Brake&quot;‚Ä≥s crew scuttling the tanker.

From 16‚Äì24 April 1944, &quot;Newcastle&quot; took part in Operation Cockpit, an airstrike from the carriers and against Sabang, off Sumatra, with &quot;Newcastle&quot; forming part of the covering force and battleships and cruisers, and on 17 May, &quot;Newcastle&quot; took part in Operation Transom, another carrier strike by &quot;Illustrious&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot;, this time against Surabaya, Java. On 17 December 1944, &quot;Newcastle&quot; left Ceylon as part of the escort force for Operation Robson, a carrier strike by &quot;Illustrious&quot; and against targets in Sumatra on 20 December, with the fleet returning to Ceylon on 22 December.

From early 1945, &quot;Newcastle&quot; began to be involved in direct support for the British Fourteenth Army in their campaigns in Burma. On 2 January 1945, &quot;Newcastle&quot; was deployed in support of landings on the north tip of Akyab Island, but the landings were unopposed as the Japanese had already evacuated Akyab. On 26 January, Newcastle, together with the cruisers and and the destroyers and , landed Royal Marines on Cheduba Island. She also carried out shore bombardment duties during the Battle of Ramree Island. &quot;Newcastle&quot; returned to Britain for a refit on the Tyne in May 1945, and was still being refitted at the end of the war.

==Postwar==

&quot;Newcastle&quot; completed the refit in October 1945, and was then used as a troopship carrying out trips to South Africa and Colombo, Ceylon before entering reserve at Devonport in February 1946. The ship was recommissioned late in 1947 to join the Mediterranean Fleet, with duties including acting as flagship, and supporting the interception of ships carrying Jewish refugees attempting to enter Palestine illegally. &quot;Newcastle&quot; returned to Britain at the end of 1949 and was decommissioned.

Work started on an extensive modernisation (officially classed as a &#x27;Large Repair&#x27;) at Devonport in May 1950, with the work completing in April 1952. Changes included a new bridge, revised sensors and fire control systems, and a new close-in anti-aircraft outfit of 18 40mm Bofors guns. In May 1952, &quot;Newcastle&quot; left British waters to serve in the Korean War, relieving the cruiser on station off Korea on 4 July that year. Duties included patrols, carrier escort and providing naval gunfire support to UN forces.

&quot;Newcastle&quot; also served during the Malayan Emergency in the later 1950s, shelling Malayan Communist targets in June and August 1955 and again in December 1957.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Newcastle&quot; was decommissioned and sold for scrap in 1959, and subsequently broken up at Faslane.

<doc id="447598" wikidata="Q876506" url="?curid=447598" title="Otjozondjupa Region">
<text>Otjozondjupa is one of the fourteen regions of Namibia. Its capital is Otjiwarongo. The region further contains the municipalities of Okahandja and Grootfontein and the towns Okakarara and Otavi. , Otjozondjupa had 97,945 registered voters.

==Geography==
A landmark within this region is the Waterberg Plateau Park. Twenty four kilometres west of Grootfontein lies the huge Hoba meteorite. At over 60 tons, it is the largest known meteorite on Earth, as well as the largest naturally occurring mass of iron known to exist on the planet&#x27;s surface.

In the east, Otjozondjupa borders the North-West District of Botswana. Domestically, it borders more regions than any other region of Namibia:
*Omaheke ‚Äì southeast
*Khomas ‚Äì south
*Erongo ‚Äì southwest
*Kunene ‚Äì northwest
*Oshikoto ‚Äì north
*Kavango ‚Äì northeast

==Economy and infrastructure==

Otjiwarongo, Grootfontein, Otavi, and Okahandja are linked by rail and by the main B1 and B8 trunk roads running from south to north. Communication systems in these areas are also of a high standard.

The farming activities of Okahandja and Otjiwarongo are homogeneous as these parts are well known for cattle farming. The Otavi and Grootfontein districts, and to a lesser extent also Otjiwarongo, are the granary of Namibia. The region also has a great potential to establish industries connected with such farming activities and by-products of it. It further has the advantage of combining communal and commercial farming in the same region.

According to the 2012 Namibia Labour Force Survey, unemployment in the region is 25.3%. Otjozondjupa has 72 schools with a total of 36,284 pupils.

==Politics==
The region comprises seven constituencies:

* Grootfontein
* Okahandja
* Okakarara
* Omatako
* Otavi
* Otjiwarongo
* Tsumkwe
===Regional elections===
Otjozondjupa is one of a few Namibian regions where there is considerable opposition support. In the 2004 regional election for the National Assembly of Namibia, the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO) won in six of the seven constituencies, Okakarara was won by National Unity Democratic Organisation (NUDO).

The 2015 regional elections saw SWAPO obtain 58.4% of the votes cast (2010: 48.9%) and win five of the seven constituencies. NUDO won two, Okakarara and Omatako. The same two constituencies went to NUDO again in the 2020 regional election. SWAPO&#x27;s support dropped to 44.3%, but it won the other five constituencies again. NUDO overall obtained 14.1% of the popular vote in this election. The upstart Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), an opposition party formed in August 2020, obtained 12.9% overall, and the Popular Democratic Movement (PDM) got 11.9%, but both did not get close to winning any single constituency.

===Governors===

* Rapama Kamehozu (2011‚Äì2012)
* Otto Ipinge (2015‚Äì2020)
* James Uerikua (2020‚Äìpresent)

<text>Oshikoto is one of the fourteen regions of Namibia, named after Lake Otjikoto. Its capital is Omuthiya. Further major settlements in the region are Tsumeb, Otjikoto&#x27;s capital until 2008, and Oniipa. , Oshikoto had 112,170 registered voters.

==Geography==

Oshikoto Region is named after Lake Otjikoto near its former capital Tsumeb.

Oshikoto is one of only three Namibian regions without either a shoreline or a foreign border. It borders the following regions:
*Ohangwena - north
*Kavango West - east
*Otjozondjupa - southeast
*Kunene - southwest
*Oshana - west

===Demographics===
The region&#x27;s population has grown significantly over recent years, partly as a result of resettling / redistribution within the Oshiwambo-speaking area. Apart from Tsumeb and Oniipa, people have settled in a corridor along the trunk road, sometimes forming quite dense concentrations.

==Economy and infrastructure==

The northern part of the region practices crop agriculture, whereas the main economic activities in the southern part are cattle rearing and mining. The two areas have important cultural and historical links in that the Ndonga people have extracted copper at Tsumeb since the earliest times in order to make rings and tools.

Pearl millet (Mahangu) is the principal crop in the north, while cattle are reared in the Mangetti and the Tsumeb district. Although the Tsumeb mine has only a limited life span, it provides a boost for the communal areas of the region together with the associated support industries and services.

Communication networks and infrastructure are well developed in the area: a paved trunk road runs across the region, linking it to both the south and the north of the country. The national microwave network terminates at Tsumeb, but telecommunications are now carried across the region and as far as Oshakati by means of a newly laid optical fiber cable.

According to the 2012 Namibia Labour Force Survey, unemployment in the Oshikoto Region is 26.4%. Oshikoto has 200 schools with a total of 60,439 pupils.

==Politics==
===Constituencies===
Oshikoto comprises eleven constituencies:

* Eengodi
* Guinas
* Nehale lyaMpingana (created 2013)
* Okankolo
* Olukonda
* Omuntele
* Omuthiyagwiipundi
* Onayena
* Oniipa
* Onyaanya (until 1999 &quot;Okatope Constituency&quot;)
* Tsumeb (until 1999 &quot;Oshikoto Constituency&quot;)
===Regional elections===
Electorally, Oshikoto is consistently dominated by the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO). In the 2004 regional election for the National Assembly of Namibia, SWAPO won all constituencies, and mostly by a landslide. In Eengodi no opposition party even nominated a candidate.

The 2015 local and regional elections saw SWAPO obtain 98.8% of the votes cast (2010: 95.6%) and win nine of the eleven constituencies uncontested . The remaining two constituencies were also won by SWAPO with majorities well over 80%. 

Although SWAPO&#x27;s support dropped to 73.2% of the total votes in the 2020 regional election it again won in all constituencies. Most of the non-SWAPO votes went to the upstart Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), an opposition party formed in August 2020.

===Governors===
* Penda Ya Ndakolo (2004‚Äì2015 and 2020‚Äìpresent)
* Henock Kankoshi (2015‚Äì2020)

<text>Oshana is one of the fourteen regions of Namibia; its capital is Oshakati. The towns of Oshakati, Ongwediva and Ondangwa, all situated with this region, form an urban cluster with the second largest population concentration in Namibia after the capital Windhoek. , Oshana had 113,112 registered voters.

==Geography==

Oshana is one of only three Namibian regions without either a coastline or a foreign border. It borders the following regions:
*Ohangwena - north
*Oshikoto - east
*Kunene - south
*Omusati - west

The name &quot;Oshana&quot; describes the most prominent landscape feature in the area, namely the shallow, seasonally inundated depressions which underpin the local agro ecological system. Although communications are hindered during the rainy season, the fish which breed in the oshanas provide an important source of dietary protein.

==Economy and infrastructure==
The Oshakati-Ongwediva-Ondangwa complex has experienced dramatic urban growth in recent years and forms an important commercial and potential industrial focus. As a whole, it forms the second largest population concentration in Namibia after Windhoek, but it still lacks basic infrastructure and most of the services and facilities normally found in urban areas of this size. The majority of businesses in northern Namibia are located here, providing a significant amount of employment. However, urbanisation is continuing within the region.

The area is far more densely populated in north, which is linked to Tsumeb and other regions by the high quality trunk road; this also facilitates the transport of freight. However, a significant improvement in the rest of the road network and in other forms of telecommunications are required. Oshakati and Ondangwa have airstrips which handle medium-sized airplanes in daylight only and provision can be made for both passengers and airfreight. The establishment of a control tower may contribute to the improvement of all-weather air and transport. Oshakati has a state hospital which supports a number of clinics. Although both primary and secondary schools are spread across the region, they are few relative to the amount of inhabitants of the region.
Omahangu is the principal staple crop grown in Oshana, which is suitable for agriculture. However, the soil is exhausted over much of the central area and requires substantial fertilisation in order to maintain reasonable productivity. Cattle also do well here and herds are extensive. The southern portion of Oshana is an extensive savannah plain stretching as far as the Etosha Pan, but the generally high salinity of soil and water render it unsuitable for grazing or cultivation.

According to the 2012 Namibia Labour Force Survey, unemployment in Oshana Region is 24.5%. Oshana has 137 schools with a total of 50,740 pupils.

==Politics==
The region comprises eleven constituencies:

* Okaku
* Okatana
* Okatyali
* Ompundja
* Ondangwa Rural
* Ondangwa Urban
* Ongwediva
* Oshakati East
* Oshakati West
* Uukwiyu
* Uuvudhiya

Electorally, Oshana region is consistently dominated by the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO).

===Regional elections===
In the 2004 regional election for the National Assembly of Namibia, SWAPO won in all constituencies by a landslide.

The 2015 local and regional elections saw SWAPO obtain 92% of the total votes (2010: 91.0) and win uncontested seven of the eleven Oshana constituencies. The remaining four constituencies SWAPO won by a landslide, with results well over 90%. Although SWAPO&#x27;s support dropped to 65.4% of the total votes in the 2020 regional election it again won in all constituencies. Only in Ondangwa Urban did the upstart Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), an opposition party formed in August 2020, come close to a council seat.

===Governors===
Clemens Kashuupulwa was appointed governor of Oshana in 1998. He was reappointed in 2015 following the 2014 election and served in this position until November 2018. In March 2019 Elia Irimari was appointed to succeed him.

<text>Omusati (the Oshindonga word for Mopane, the dominant tree in the area) is one of the fourteen regions of Namibia, its capital is Outapi. The towns of Okahao, Oshikuku and Ruacana as well as the self-governed village Tsandi are situated in this region. , Omusati had 148,834 registered voters.

The region is home to the Ruacana Falls, among the largest waterfalls in Africa, and the Omugulugwombashe heritage site, where the Namibian struggle for independence started in 1966.

==Geography==
In the north, Omusati borders the Cunene Province of Angola. Domestically, it borders the following regions:
*Ohangwena - northeast
*Oshana - east
*Kunene - south and west

The region got its name from the Mopane tree (&quot;omusati&quot;: ) which is the dominant species in the region. The Makalani palms decrease rapidly westwards from the border with Oshana region. The change in vegetation type reflects ecological conditions forming a natural boundary between the two regions.

The region is home to the Ruacana Falls. The waterfall is 120 meters (390¬†ft) high and 700 meters (2,300¬†ft) wide in full flood and is among the largest waterfalls in Africa, both by volume and width.

===Villages===

* Okaleke 
* Ohembe 
* Olupandu 
* Onelombo 
* Omutaku Ngwakayupa
* Onekukumo
* Onawa
* Ouholondema
* Onghili
* Onembamba
==Economy and infrastructure==
The northern part of Omusati is far more densely populated than the south, where the grazing is of poor quality and the water is generally saline. This is primarily an agricultural region where mahangu, also known as pearl millet, is successfully grown. A canal carries water from the Ruacana river to Oshakati, passing through Outapi. Water from this canal has been used to irrigate a large, government-run farm at Etunda where crops from maize to watermelon to bananas are grown. The electrical network covers towns including Outapi, Ruacana, Tsandi, Oshikuku, and Okahao.

The region is traversed by a high standard trunk road which provides a direct link to adjacent regions and the rest of the country. Although passenger and freight transport along this route is easy, the rest of this road network, in common with all the communal areas of northern Namibia, is of poor quality. Okahao and Outapi both have small hospitals, and a network of clinics provides basic services.

Only 17% of households in Omusati have access to improved sanitation (toilet facilities). According to the 2012 Namibia Labour Force Survey, unemployment in the Region is 28.9%. Omusati has 274 schools with a total of 86,365 pupils.

==Politics==
The governor of Omusati since 2015 is Erginus Endjala. The region comprises twelve constituencies:

* Anamulenge
* Elim
* Etayi
* Ogongo
* Okahao
* Okalongo
* Onesi
* Oshikuku
* Otamanzi
* Outapi
* Ruacana
* Tsandi
Electorally, Omusati region is consistently dominated by the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO). For instance, Omusati voters selected SWAPO with 97.68% of their votes in the 2004 parliamentary election, and again with 98% in the 2014 election.

===Regional elections===
In the 2004 regional election for the National Assembly of Namibia, SWAPO won in all constituencies by a landslide. In Anamulenge and Otamanzi no opposition party even nominated a candidate.

The 2015 local and regional elections saw SWAPO obtain 99.4% of the total votes (2010: 99.0) and win uncontested eight of the twelve Omusati constituencies, and two of the five towns. The remaining four constituencies SWAPO won by a landslide, with results ranging from 89% (Ruacana) to 98% (Ogongo). Although SWAPO&#x27;s support dropped to 86.5% of the total votes in the 2020 regional election, it again won all constituencies by a large margin.

<doc id="447603" wikidata="Q838775" url="?curid=447603" title="Omaheke Region">
<text>Omaheke (the Otjiherero word for sandveld) is one of the fourteen regions of Namibia, the least populous region. Its capital is Gobabis. It lies in eastern Namibia on the border with Botswana and is the western extension of the Kalahari Desert. The self-governed villages of Otjinene, Leonardville and Witvlei are situated in the region. , Omaheke had 48,594 registered voters.

==Geography==
In the east, Omaheke borders are three districts of Botswana:
*North-West - northern
*Ghanzi - eastern
*Kgalagadi - southern
Domestically, it borders the following regions:
*Hardap - south
*Khomas - west
*Otjozondjupa - north

Omaheke is traversed by the northwesterly line of equal latitude and longitude.

A large part of this region is known as the &quot;Sandveld&quot;. The northeastern part of the region is still very much wilderness. According to the 2012 Namibia Labour Force Survey, unemployment in the Omaheke Region is 34.1%.

Anthropologically, almost the entire Ovambanderu and Gobabis-Ju«Äwa ethnic groups reside in the region. Furthermore, it is a rich cultural area for Herero, Damara-Nama, Tswana, Afrikaners and Germans. According to the 2011 census, 43% of the population speak Otjiherero, 30% speak Nama/Damara and 8% speak Afrikaans at home.

==Economy and infrastructure==

Gobabis is the centre of this area and also its main business area, as it is linked with the capital of Namibia, Windhoek, by rail and the tarred B6 national road. This infrastructure serves as the main supply line for the region.

All the other population centres in the region are linked with Gobabis by road. Many other services are rendered from Gobabis to the region, such as the Police Divisional Headquarters, which is situated in Gobabis. Clinics in the region are served by medical practitioners based in Gobabis, and there are two hospitals and a clinic serving the region.

The agricultural patterns of this region is to a large extent homogenous. Most of the 900 commercial and 3,500 communal farmers in this area are cattle breeders. A regional office of the Ministry of Agriculture, serving the whole region, is based in Gobabis.

Hunting, including trophy hunting, is one of the major sources of income for the region. This takes place mainly in the winter months, from June to August. During these months, tourists from the northern hemisphere can be seen in the area, enjoying the mild and dry winter climate and collecting trophies.

In 2013 Omaheke had 42 government schools with a total of 18,365 pupils.

==Politics==
Upon independence of Namibia, the eastern part of Hereroland was absorbed into Omaheke Region. The region comprises seven constituencies:

* Aminuis
* Epukiro
* Gobabis
* Kalahari
* Okorukambe (formerly &quot;Steinhausen&quot;)
* Otjinene
* Otjombinde

As in all other regions, SWAPO was by far the strongest political party since Namibian independence. However, Omaheke is a region where there has always been considerably support for opposition parties.

===Presidential elections===
In the 2004 presidential election, the Omaheke Region supported SWAPO Hifikepunye Pohamba with 13,005 votes (46%) but the Ohangwena Region native did not win a majority of the votes in the region. National Unity Democratic Organisation (NUDO)&#x27;s Kuaima Riruako, paramount chief of the Herero people, received over 7,000 votes (25%), and the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA)&#x27;s Katuutire Kaura received over 3,700 votes (13%). Only in the much more populated Khomas Region and neighboring Otjozondjupa Region did Riruako gain more votes, and in no other region did NUDO&#x27;s candidate gain a higher percentage of the votes.

===Regional elections===
In the 2004 regional election for the National Assembly of Namibia, SWAPO won four of the seven constituencies. Aminuis and Otjinene were won by candidates of NUDO, and in Otjombinde the South West Africa National Union (SWANU) candidate became councillor.

In the 2015 regional elections SWAPO obtained 54% of the total votes (2010: 47%) and won four of the seven constituencies. NUDO obtained 23% of the total votes (2010: 26%) and won Aminuis and Otjinene, while Otjombinde was won by an independent candidate. Although SWAPO&#x27;s support dropped to 44% of the total votes in the 2020 regional election, it won five of the seven constituencies, while NUDO (23% total) kept its strongholds Otjinene and Aminuis.

===Governors===
* Laura McLeod-Katjirua (SWAPO, 2001‚Äì2012)
* Rapama Kamehozu (2012‚Äì2013)
*Festus Ueitele (2013‚Äì2020)
*Pijoo Nganate (2020‚Äìpresent)

<text>Ohangwena is one of the fourteen regions of Namibia, its capital is Eenhana. Major settlements in the region are the towns Eenhana and Helao Nafidi as well as the self-governed village of Okongo and the proclaimed settlements Ongha, Ongenga and Omungwelume. , Ohangwena had 150,724 registered voters.

Ohangwena is traversed by the northwesterly line of equal latitude and longitude. In the north, Ohangwena borders Angola: the Cunene Province, except for a small border with Cuando Cubango Province in the far northeast. Domestically, it borders the following regions:
*Kavango West - East
*Oshikoto - South
*Oshana - South West
*Omusati - West

==Economy and infrastructure==
The northern and western parts of the region are the most densely populated of this essentially subsistence agricultural region in which small scale mahangu cultivation and the keeping of cattle form the predominant activities. Although the region depends on rain fed agriculture, other crops can be established under intensive cultivation.

The main settlements in the region straddle the good paved road from the Angolan border to Ondangwa, where it joins the Oshakati-Tsumeb trunk road. The eastern part of the region possesses good grazing land, but the shortage of water and poor communications render it uninhabitable at present. There is a tarred road from Onhuno to Okongo that was recently completed, it is thought to greatly increase the area&#x27;s agricultural potential.

Ohangwena has 234 schools with a total of 90,703 pupils. 

== Libraries ==
Ohangwena region has a regional library (Ohangwena Regional Library) which is an answer for learners and students to their research and school projects. It is situated in Helao Nafidi Town.

* Okongo
* Omulonga (created in 2003)
* Omundaungilo
* Ondobe
* Ongenga

===Election results===
Ohangwena is one of the regions where many Namibian politicians are from, including former president Hifikepunye Pohamba, Hidipo Hamutenya (founding president of the Rally for Democracy and Progress, RDP), minister of environment and tourism Pohamba Shifeta, former deputy minister and ambassador Hadino Hishongwa, founding member of SWAPO Mzee Kaukungwa and several other ministers and high-profile politicians.

A significant amount of fighting occurred in the region during the Namibian War of Independence. Just as Namibia was set for independence, fighting broke out on April 1, 1989, in the region between People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Namibia combatants and soldiers in the occupying South African Defence Force. The resulting &quot;9 day war&quot; left many dead.

Ohangwena Region is a SWAPO stronghold. In the 2004 regional election for the National Assembly of Namibia, SWAPO won in all constituencies by a landslide. In Omundaungilo no opposition party even nominated a candidate. In the 2015 regional elections SWAPO obtained 95% of the total votes (2010: 92%) and won all twelve constituencies with 90% or more. The Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP) managed to name opposition candidates in all constituencies but one, and the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) in two. In the 2020 regional election SWAPO&#x27;s support dropped slightly to 82% of the total votes. It still won all constituencies by a large margin.

==Politics==
The region comprises seven constituencies:

* Epupa (until 1998 &quot;Ruacana Constituency&quot;)
* Kamanjab
* Khorixas
* Opuwo Rural (created 2013 from a split of Opuwo Constituency)
* Opuwo Urban (created 2013 from a split of Opuwo Constituency)
* Outjo
* Sesfontein
Kunene is one of few regions that Namibia&#x27;s ruling SWAPO party does not dominate. Previously the rivalry was mainly with the United Democratic Front (UDF), but recently other parties show good results in Kunene&#x27;s constituencies. In November 2008, SWAPO activists and politicians called for organization to &quot;destroy&quot; the UDF government in Kunene. SWAPO also claimed that UDF and Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) were &quot;sabotaging&quot; local government initiatives in the region due to incompetence.

Central to the politics of Kunene Region is the battle over the proposed Epupa Dam in Epupa Constituency near the border with Angola. Business leaders based in Opuwo, who are mostly Ovambo people, formed the Kaoko Development League which supports the proposed dam. The dam would bring in economic development to much of the Region but would interfere with the traditional way of life of the Himba people who reside in the area. A longtime rivalry exists between SWAPO and the Himba people.

===National elections===
In the 2004 election for the National Assembly of Namibia, voters in Kunene Region supported numerous parties. The UDF earned the party&#x27;s single highest vote total and 22.19% of the party&#x27;s national vote total in the region. 

===Regional elections===
In the first regional elections in 1992 for the National Assembly of Namibia, SWAPO won in Kamanjab and Outjo. The UDF won in Sesfontein and Khorixas, Opuwo was won by the DTA.

In the 2004 regional election for the National Assembly of Namibia, SWAPO won only one constituency in Kunene. Consequently, the only members of the 3rd National Council of Namibia, which was created by appointments from every regional council, who were not members of SWAPO were chosen by the Kunene Regional Council. These Councillors were Sebastian Ignatius «ÉGobs of the UDF and Ngohauvi Lydia Kavetu of the DTA. 

In the 2015 regional elections SWAPO obtained 46% of the total votes (2010: 42%) and won in five of the seven constituencies while the DTA won two. The two Kunene constituencies Epupa and Opuwo Rural were the only ones the DTA won throughout Namibia. In the 2020 regional election SWAPO obtained 34% of the total votes and won only Outjo Constituency. The Popular Democratic Movement (PDM, the new name of the DTA) and the UDF won three constituencies each.

===Governors===
Themistokles Dudu Murorua, a UDF member, was appointed governor of Kunene Region in 2005. He was later replaced by Joshua «ÅHoebeb. Following the 2014 elections and SWAPO&#x27;s win in Kunene, Angelika Muharukua was appointed governor, and after her death in 2017, Marius Sheya was appointed.

==Health==
Cholera is a major concern in Kunene Region, particularly near the border with Angola. In December 2008, while the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak caused the deaths of hundreds of Zimbabweans, a similar but separate outbreak occurred in the northern Kunene Region constituency of Epupa. As 19 December, 3 people had died and 29 had become sick. In May 2008, approximately 15 people died of cholera as well.

==Human Rights==
February 2012, traditional Himba chiefs issued two separate Declarations to the African Union and to the OHCHR of the United Nations.

The first, titled &quot;Declaration of the most affected Ovahimba, Ovatwa, Ovatjimba and Ovazemba against the Orokawe Dam in the Baynes Mountains&quot; outlines the objections from regional Himba chiefs and communities that reside near the Kunene River.

The second, titled &quot;Declaration by the traditional Himba leaders of Kaokoland in Namibia&quot; lists violations of civil, cultural, economic, environmental, social and political rights perpetrated by the Government of Namibia (GoN).

September 2012, the United Nations special rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples visited the Himba, and heard their concerns that they do not have recognized traditional authorities, and that they are placed under the jurisdictions of chiefs of neighboring dominant tribes, who make decisions on behalf of the minority communities. In his view, the lack of recognition of traditional chiefs is, in accordance with Namibian law, relates to a lack of recognition of the minority indigenous tribes&#x27; communal lands.

November 23, 2012, hundreds of Himba and Zemba from Omuhonga and Epupa region protested in Okanguati against Namibia‚Äôs plans to construct a dam in the Kunene River in the Baynes Mountains, against increasing mining operations on their traditional land and human rights violations against them.

March 25, 2013, over thousand Himba and Zemba people marched in protest again, this time in Opuwo, against the ongoing human rights violations that they endure in Namibia. They expressed their frustration over their traditional chiefs not being recognized as &quot;Traditional Authorities&quot; by the Government of Namibia, Namibia&#x27;s plans to build the Orokawe dam in the Baynes Mountains at the Cunene River without consulting with the Himba that do not consent to the construction plans, culturally inappropriate education, the illegal fencing of parts of their traditional land, the lack of land rights to the territory that they have lived upon for centuries, and against the implementation of the Communal Land Reform Act of 2002.
==Economy and infrastructure==

Compared to the rest of Namibia, Kunene is relatively underdeveloped. This is due to the mountainous inaccessible geography and the dryness that significantly hinders agriculture.

In 2012, Chinese company Namibia East China Non- Ferrous Investments explored the Kunene region discovering enough a deposit of 2.37 billion tons of iron ore, enough for the next 100 years. A cobalt deposit is being developed by Gecko Opuwo Cobal.

Kunene has 60 schools with a total of 20,332 pupils.

<text>Wen Tianxiang (; June 6, 1236 ‚Äì January 9, 1283), noble title Duke of Xin (), was a Chinese statesman, poet and politician in the last years of the Southern Song dynasty. For his resistance to Kublai Khan&#x27;s invasion of the Southern Song dynasty, and for his refusal to yield to the Yuan dynasty despite being captured and tortured, he is a popular culture hero symbol of patriotism, righteousness, and resistance against tyranny in China. He is known as one of the &#x27;Three Loyal Princes of the Song&#x27; (), alongside Lu Xiufu and Zhang Shijie. Wen Tianxiang is depicted in the Wu Shuang Pu (ÁÑ°ÈõôË≠ú, Table of Peerless Heroes) by Jin Guliang.

His continuing symbolic importance was evident in an event that took place in Wen Tianxiang&#x27;s historical shrine in Haifeng (Haifeng County) in 1908, where Chen Jiongming persuaded over thirty young men from the village to swear secret support for a national revolution.
==Biography==
Wen was born on 6 June 1236 in Luling (Ji&#x27;an), Jiangxi Province during the Song dynasty. At the age of 18, he excelled in his local examinations, and two years later participated in examinations in the capital, during which he was personally awarded first rank (&quot;Zhuangyuan&quot;) by Emperor Lizong. He would subsequently take up several posts in the government of the Southern Song, including being Attendant () of the Justice Ministry and Prefect of Ganzhou. Wen Tianxiang was frequently in conflict with the corrupt magistrate Jia Sidao and the pro-peace faction as he supported the war effort against the invading Mongols. Wen once requested the execution of a eunuch who proposed fleeing from the capital Lin&#x27;an. As a result, Wen was demoted and forced into premature retirement at the age of 37.

Later when the war situation further deteriotated, Wen was recalled an appointed as the Prefect of Ganzhou. He immediately recruited some troops from the local population and was later assigned to defend the region of Pingjiang (now in Suzhou, Jiangsu). In 1275, Yuan Mongols troops under Bayan attacked the Jiangsu and Jiejiang regions. Yuan forces quickly bypassed Pingjiang and marched directly to the region now known as Yuhang District. Wen Tianxiang hurriedly rushed to Yuhang but he was too late, his former base in Pingjiang was also quickly overwhelmed by the Mongols. Wen and his troops then retreated back to Lin&#x27;an. Together with Zhang Shijie, Wen Tianxiang proposed a plan to keep fighting, but it was rejected by Chancellor of the Right Chen Yizhong. At that time many Song court officials (including Chancellor of the Left Liu Mengyang) had already run away fearing the approaching Yuan troops, while others were mostly pro-peace. Pro-war figures like Zhang Shijie also left to continue the fight on their own. The Song Empress Dowager finally decided to surrender, and Wen was appointed as the new Chancellor of the Right to lead the Song delegation to ask the Yuan for peace (1276).

However, Wen Tianxiang didn&#x27;t plead for a surrender as tasked. When meeting Bayan, Wen asked Bayan about the Mongol&#x27;s intentions and demanded the retreat of the Yuan forces:

Seeing that Wen Tianxiang was determined to not surrender, Bayan arrested Wen in the Mongol headquarters. An enraged but helpless Wen Tianxiang could only witness the Empress Dowager and other Song court officials finalize their surrender. Nonetheless, Wen managed to escape from the Yuan Mongol camp, and head to Yang province. The Yang prefect wrongly suspected Wen as a spy from the Yuan, therefore Wen further travelled south and finally met Zhang Shije and Chen Yizhong in Fuzhou, this time with a newly crowned Emperor Duanzong. After a brief discussion, Wen travelled to Nanjian pronvince (now located as Nanping, Fujian province) to recruit troops, then marched to Jiangxi. Wen managed to gain several victories, but he was soon overwhelmed by the Yuan forces led by Zhang Hongfan and was arrested (1278).

Wen was treated well by Zhang Hongfan and was promised a prestigious Yuan post in exchange for his surrender, but Wen refused. Later, Song resistance forces was completely destroyed at the Battle of Yamen (1279), Zhang again provide the same offer, reasoning that Wen was no longer bound by the already perished as Song Dynasty. Wen again categorically refused, saying that &quot;I was a court officer of the Song but failed to save the country. I deserve to be tried as a criminal, why should I cling to my life now?&quot; Zhang had no choice but escort Wen to Dadu. He was imprisoned in a military prison. During this time he wrote the poems &quot;Song of Righteousness&quot; (), and &quot;Crossing the Lingding Sea&quot;, the latter of which included these lines of defiance in the face of Mongol rule:

The Yuan court, still hoping to persuade Wen Tianxiang, sent the former Song Chancellor Liu Mengyan (the one who had run away when the Mongols approached Lin&#x27;an) to see Wen in prison. An enraged Wen Tianxiang immediately gave Liu a violent scolding. The Yuan sent former Emperor Gong of Song to persuade Wen, but he simply answered: &quot;Your Highness please come back to the palace!&quot; Later his brother Wen Pi was also sent to the prison with the same task, and Wen Tianxang said: &quot;We have the same parents but do not serve under the same sky!&quot; During the imprisonment, Wen Tianxiang also received letters from his daughter, informing him that his whole family was held captive in the Yuan royal palace. Wen then replied: &quot;I have received the letter, my soul hurts so much. Everybody have relatives and family, but in this circumstance I can only choose death, there is no alternative.&quot;

In 1283, Wen Tianxiang was summoned to appear before Kublai Khan. He briefly bowed his head to greet the Yuan Emperor, but refused to prostrate as a subordinate of the Yuan. Kublai Khan expressed respect to Wen and again offered him a prestigious position. Wen repeated his refusal, saying: &quot;I am Song&#x27;s chancellor, I cannot serve another dynasty! I can only accept death, if not, I cannot face the matyrs at the Underworld. [...] I only desire death, I have nothing to say.&quot; At that time an uprising arose and the rebels declared they would attack Dadu &quot;to rescue Chancellor Wen&quot;. Kublai Khan had no choice but to execute Wen Tianxiang.

It is said that after Wen&#x27;s death, people discovered his death poem written as:

== Ancestry and descendants ==
Wen Tianxiang adopted the three sons of his younger brother when his two sons died young.

There are now at least six branches of the Wen family in the provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Hainan, Guangdong, Fujian, and in Hong Kong and overseas locations. Local dialect pronunciations would be &quot;Man&quot; (Cantonese), &quot;Vun&quot; (Hakka), &quot;Boon&quot; (Hokkien) and &quot;Bhung&quot; (Teochew). The &quot;Man&quot; clan are considered one of the original founding families in the history of Hong Kong.

The well-known Ming dynasty painter and calligrapher Wen Zhengming also belonged to the Wen family. The mother of Mao Zedong, Wen Qimei, was a descendant as well.

One of the oldest continuous branches of the Wen family established itself in the Hengyang/Hengshan area of present-day Hunan shortly after 1000. A branch of this Wen family settled in the United States in the mid-1940s and is related through marriage to the prominent Sun family of Shouxian, Anhui (Sun Jianai; Fou Foong Flour Company Á¶èË±êÈ∫µÁ≤âÂª†) and the Li family of Hefei, Anhui (Li Hongzhang).

== Monuments ==

===Jiangxi===

Wen Tianxiang&#x27;s hometown in Ji&#x27;an, Jiangxi honors the famous national hero with a mausoleum. Exhibitions of paintings, calligraphy, and even army uniforms supposedly left by Wen are displayed in the Wen Family Ancestral Temple in Futian. The Wen Tianxiang Mausoleum is located in Wohushan.

===Beijing===

The Memorial to Prime Minister Wen Tianxiang was built in 1376 during the reign of the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty. The location of Wen&#x27;s execution is thought to be near the entrance to Fuxue Alley in the East City District of Beijing and a memorial has been established on the northern side of the entrance to South Fuxue Alley near Beixinqiao.

&quot;The Song Dynasty&#x27;s Top Ranking Scholar and Prime Minister, the West River&#x27;s Filial Son and Loyal Subject,&quot; is carved into the columns of the memorial&#x27;s main hall.

===Guangdong===

The &quot;Golden Marshal&#x27;s Cemetery&quot; commemorating the heroes of the anti-Yuan nationality at the end of the Song dynasty was established in the Gurao Township, Chaoyang District, Shantou City, Guangdong Province. There are many legends about Wen Tianxiang in the area of Gurao Town, Chaoyang District. According to legend, in the last years of the Southern Song dynasty, Wen Tianxiang raised an army in Chaoyang to resist the invading Yuan forces and was captured in Haifeng County during the campaign. Due to the great disparity in strength between the two sides, most of the Song soldiers were killed. Based on investigation, there are nine Song tombs in Gu Rao and neighboring towns. In later years, festive activities were held to commemorate Marshal General Wen Tianxiang and his descendant, These develop into what is known as the Gurao Festival. During this festival, the villages are covered with red and green, and the villagers walk through the streets to perform folk art tours. Overseas travellers have also returned to their hometowns.

===Taiwan===

In the late 1950s and 1960s, a place called &quot;&quot;, within the present Taroko National Park, was renamed &quot;Tianxiang&quot; in memory of Wen Tianxiang during the construction of the Central Cross-Island Highway. Tianxiang is now a famous resort in the east of Taiwan.

In addition, three streets also take their name from Wen (i.e. the &quot;Tianxiang Road&quot;). One is in Zhongshan District, Taipei nearby the Minquan W. Road MRT station, another is in Sanmin District, Kaohsiung and the other is in Xiulin, Hualien County.

===Hong Kong===
The San Tin area in the New Territories of Hong Kong is home to many villagers surnamed &quot;Man&quot;, the Cantonese pronunciation of &quot;Wen&quot;. The &quot;Man&quot; villagers trace their ancestry to Wen Tianxiang via Man Tin-Sui, also a famous Song dynasty general and the cousin of Wen Tianxiang.

A Man Tin Cheung Memorial Park and &quot;Man&quot; ancestral hall and residence (Tai Fu Tai Mansion) in San Tin are historical attractions in Hong Kong.

<text>Alice Lloyd College is a private work college in Pippa Passes, Kentucky, US. It was co-founded by the journalist Alice Spencer Geddes Lloyd (a native of Cambridge, Massachusetts) and June Buchanan (a native of New York) in 1923, at first under the name of Caney Junior College. Founded as an institution to educate leaders in Appalachia locally, it became a bachelor&#x27;s degree-granting institution in the early 1980s. Alice Lloyd College is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).

==Academics==
, Alice Lloyd College has implemented 18 major degree programs and eight pre-professional programs into its curricula. The student-to-faculty ratio is 14.5:1 with an average class size of 18.

Ninety-five percent of Alice Lloyd College graduates are accepted into graduate and professional schools. Seventy-five percent of Alice Lloyd College graduates are the first in their families to obtain an undergraduate degree.

==Rankings and reputation==

In the 2022 edition of U.S. News rankings, Alice Lloyd College was ranked number 21 in Regional Colleges South and number 5 in Best Value Schools.

==Student finances and required work==
Although Alice Lloyd College does not rely on any direct financial support from the state or federal governments, it does accept students using federal and state student financial aid such as federal Pell Grants. 16 percent of students receive education loans, for an average of approximately $800. According to the Project on Student Debt, each of Alice Lloyd&#x27;s 2009 graduates carried an average debt of $6,500, which is well below the statewide average of $19,112 and the national average of $24,000. The college, which accepted 262 of 6,337 applicants for the class of 2017, guarantees tuition to full-time students from an area consisting of 108 counties in Central Appalachia.

Students are required to work part-time regardless of financial situation. They are given jobs such as janitorial staff, office assistant, tutor, craft maker, resident advisor, maintenance, grounds or working in the cafeteria (Hunger Din). In addition to on-campus jobs, students can work at off-campus outreach projects. Students are required to work at least 160 hours per semester. The college is one of nine work colleges in the United States and one of two in Kentucky (Berea College being the other) that have mandatory work-study programs.

Students from 108 counties in the Appalachian Mountains region of Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia pay no tuition through the Appalachian Leaders College Scholarship.

==Student life==
The dormitories house about 600 students, with rental prices averaging $1,900 annually. Alice Lloyd College requires students to live in gender-separated dormitories and only allows the opposite sex into a gender-specific dorm during &quot;open houses,&quot; after room checks have been made. Room checks consist of two resident advisors going into each room and making sure that it is clean and it does not contain any illegal substances. The college is located in Knott County, Kentucky, a dry county, thus alcoholic beverages are prohibited.

Professional dress is required of all students on central campus until 2:00¬†p.m. every Tuesday and for all convocation programs.

While this college is not affiliated with any religious denomination, the college&#x27;s mission statement emphasizes the role of Christian values. In addition, the college offers coursework in religion and has a chapter of Baptist Collegiate Ministries.

The college choir is called the &quot;Voices of Appalachia.&quot; The choir, formed in 1962, holds a tour annually in the spring, performing hymns and ballads. The choir has made several media appearances, including NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;.

The college offers a series of speakers and events called convocations. Students are required to attend six convocations per semester.

==Campus==
The Commodore Slone Building, at one time housing the science program and most recently the June Buchanan School, the college&#x27;s K-12 prep school, was renovated to house the business program. The Business &amp; Technology Center was completed in the fall of 2009 and was dedicated on October 10, 2009.

==Caney Cottage Scholarship==
The college owns the H.N. and Frances C. Berger Residence Hall, also known as Caney Cottage, an apartment complex near the campus of the University of Kentucky in Lexington. Students who graduate from Alice Lloyd and are accepted into the University of Kentucky&#x27;s graduate school can apply to live in the Caney Cottage rent, utility and parking free. Those who attend other graduate schools can apply for cash scholarships that go toward tuition costs. After graduate school, scholarship recipients must commit to service in the Appalachian region.

<doc id="447619" wikidata="Q3377502" url="?curid=447619" title="HMS Newcastle (D87)">
<text>The eighth HMS &quot;Newcastle&quot; was a batch 1 Type 42 destroyer of the Royal Navy, launched in 1975. &quot;Newcastle&quot; was decommissioned on 1 February 2005.

==Operational service==
On 12 May 1992, &quot;Newcastle&quot; deployed with the &quot;Orient &#x27;92&quot; group HMS Invincible, HMS Boxer, HMS Norfolk and RFA Olwen to the Far East. During this time she partook in Joint Exercises in the Malacca Straits and carried out diplomatic visits to The Seychelles, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and the Philippines. She returned on 27 November 1992.
In 1993, &quot;Newcastle&quot; undertook exercises in the northern fjords of Norway during Exercise Battle Griffin &#x27;93 and undertook Fleet Ready Escort duties. On 8 September 1993 she deployed for &quot;Southlant&quot; duties as Falkland Islands Guardship. En route, she called in at Abidjan, Cote d&#x27;Ivoire and spent Christmas and New Year in and around the Falkland Island patrol areas. She was relieved by the Leander Class Frigate HMS Scylla and returned to UK via the Patagonian Canals, calling in at Valparaiso, Callao and Port of Spain with a fuelling stop at Ponta Delgado before returning to Portsmouth on 8 April 1994. The rest of 1994 was spent in maintenance and navigation training. She paid off into refit in Rosyth in July 1995. On her way north, &quot;Newcastle&quot; made a final goodwill visit of this commission to the city of her name.

In November 1997, &quot;Newcastle&quot; made her way to the Caribbean to assume duties as West Indies guard ship. This deployment was concerned primarily with counter narcotics operations and saw the ship embark a US Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) under the command of US Coast Guard District 7 in Miami. Throughout the eight months of the &quot;WIGS&quot; deployment &quot;Newcastle&quot; rendered assistance to the Governor and people of the British Overseas Territory of Montserrat following a devastating volcanic eruption. &quot;Newcastle&quot; re-entered Portsmouth Naval Base on 10 July 1998.

In 1999, &quot;Newcastle&quot; escorted the aircraft carrier during the Kosovo War, in which &quot;Invincible&quot; launched attacks on Serbian targets. &quot;Newcastle&quot; took part in six-month Atlantic Patrol Deployment in 2002. During this deployment, she visited Sierra Leone to display the continuing UK commitment to that country. Despite speculation that four Type 42s would be either decommissioned or mothballed, &quot;Newcastle&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean in January 2004 for a 7-month tour of duty.

==Decommissioning and disposal==

It was announced in July 2004, as part of the &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World&quot; review, that &quot;Newcastle&quot; would be decommissioned in January 2005. &quot;Newcastle&quot; was decommissioned on 1 February 2005 and placed into inactive reserve. Whilst sitting out at Fareham Creek she was cannibalised heavily to keep the remaining Type 42 destroyers running. On 21 November 2008 &quot;Newcastle&quot; left Portsmouth for the last time for Aliaƒüa, Turkey under tow of the tug &quot;Lore&quot;. There is a model of HMS Newcastle on the fourth floor of Barrow-in-Furness General Hospital.

==Notable commanders==

Notable officers who commanded &quot;Newcastle&quot; include: Julian Oswald (1977-79), Norman King (1979-1980), Anthony Hutton (1982-1984) and Alan Massey (1993-1994).

==Affiliations==
&quot;Newcastle&quot; was the adopted ship of the city of Newcastle upon Tyne. Her captain and crew were awarded the freedom of the city, and she was often referred to as &quot;The Geordie Gunboat&quot;.

The Strip, as it is known, is about long, and is immediately south of the Las Vegas city limits in the unincorporated towns of Paradise and Winchester, but is often referred to simply as &quot;Las Vegas&quot;.

Many of the largest hotel, casino, and resort properties in the world are on the Strip. Its hotels, casinos, restaurants, residential high-rises, entertainment offerings, and skyline have established the Strip as one of the most popular and iconic tourist destinations in the world and is one of the driving forces for Las Vegas&#x27;s economy. Most of the Strip has been designated as an All-American Road, and the North and South Las Vegas Strip routes are classified as Nevada Scenic Byways and National Scenic Byways.

==Boundaries==

Historically, casinos that were not in Downtown Las Vegas along Fremont Street sat outside the city limits on Las Vegas Boulevard. In 1959, the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign was built exactly outside the city limits. The sign is currently located in the median just south of Russell Road which is from The Sahara, about south of the southernmost entrance to Mandalay Bay, which is the Strip&#x27;s southernmost casino.

In the strictest sense, the Strip refers only to the stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard that is roughly between Sahara Avenue and the &quot;Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas&quot; sign. Clark County uses the phrase &quot;Resort Corridor&quot; to describe the area including Las Vegas Boulevard between 215 Beltway and Sahara Avenue and surrounding areas.

The Sahara is considered the Strip&#x27;s northern terminus by Clark County, though travel guides typically extend it to the Strat to the north. Mandalay Bay, just north of Russell Road is the southernmost resort considered to be on the Strip. According to Clark County, the southern end of the Strip is the &quot;Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas&quot; sign; the county acknowledges that some argue for Russell Road at the southernmost terminus.


==History==
=== Early years (1930s‚Äì1990s) ===
The first casino to be built on Highway 91 was the Pair-o-Dice Club in 1931, but the first full service casino-resort on what is currently called the Strip was the El Rancho Vegas, which opened with 63 bungalow hotel rooms on April 3, 1941. Its success spawned a second nearby hotel, the Hotel Last Frontier in 1942. Organized crime figures such as Bugsy Siegel took an intense interest in the growing Las Vegas gaming center and funded another resort; financing the completion of the Flamingo construction with mob money. The Flamingo casino opened in December 1946, and the hotel opened in March 1947. Wilbur Clark&#x27;s Desert Inn resort opened in 1950. The funding for many Las Vegas projects was provided through the American National Insurance Company, which was based in the then-notorious gambling empire of Galveston, Texas. 

Las Vegas Boulevard South was previously called Hwy 91, or the Arrowhead Highway, or Los Angeles Highway. The Strip was named by Los Angeles police officer and businessman Guy McAfee, after his hometown&#x27;s Sunset Strip in Hollywood.

====Unincorporated town====
In 1950, Mayor Ernie Cragin of the City of Las Vegas sought to annex the Las Vegas Strip, which ran through unincorporated Clark County territory, in order to expand the city&#x27;s tax base to fund his ambitious building agenda and pay down the city&#x27;s rising debt. Instead, Gus Greenbaum of the Flamingo led a group of casino executives to lobby the Clark County commissioners for town status. Two unincorporated towns were eventually created, Paradise and Winchester. More than two decades later, the Supreme Court of Nevada struck down a 1975 Nevada state law that would have folded the Strip and the rest of the urban areas of Clark County into the City of Las Vegas.

Caesars Palace was established in 1966. Opening in 1969, the International Hotel, with 1,512 rooms, began the era of mega-resorts. The International is known as Westgate Las Vegas today.

The first MGM Grand Hotel and Casino opened in 1973 with 2,084 rooms. On November 21, 1980, MGM Grand suffered the worst resort fire in the history of Las Vegas as a result of electrical problems, killing 87 people. It reopened eight months later. In 1986, Kerkorian sold the MGM Grand to Bally Manufacturing, and it was renamed Bally&#x27;s.

====Mega-resorts====
The opening of The Mirage in 1989 set a new level to the Las Vegas experience, as smaller hotels and casinos made way for the larger mega-resorts. In the 1990s, more than 12 new hotels opened, including themed hotels like the Luxor, Excalibur, and Mandalay Bay. At $1.7B, the most expensive hotel in the world at the time, The Bellagio, was built in the 1990s. In 1993, the launch of the Myst√®re show at the new Treasure Island hotel by Cirque du Soleil marked a key point in transforming Las Vegas Strip entertainment.

In an effort to attract families, resorts offered more attractions geared toward youth, but had limited success. The current MGM Grand opened in 1993.

In addition to the large hotels, casinos and resorts, the Strip is home to many attractions, such as M&amp;M&#x27;s World, Adventuredome and the Fashion Show Mall.

===2000‚Äìpresent===

With the opening of Bellagio, Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn and Encore resorts, the Strip trended towards the luxurious high-end segment through most of the 2000s, while some older resorts added major expansions and renovations, including some de-theming of the earlier themed hotels.

In 2004, MGM Mirage announced plans for CityCenter, a , $7 billion multi-use project on the site of the Boardwalk hotel and adjoining land. Most elements of the project opened in late 2009.

In 2012, the High Roller Ferris wheel and a retail district called The Linq Promenade broke ground in an attempt to diversify attractions beyond that of casino resorts. Renovations and rebrandings such as The Cromwell Las Vegas and the SLS Las Vegas continued to transform the Strip in 2014. The Las Vegas Festival Grounds opened in 2015. In 2016, T-Mobile Arena, The Park, and the Park Theater (now known as Dolby Live) opened.

In 2021, the Pinball Hall of Fame moved near the &quot;Fabulous Las Vegas&quot; sign at the south end of the Strip. Later that year, Resorts World Las Vegas, opened on the site of the former Stardust Resort and Casino.

The Sphere opened in 2023. Also, the Fontainebleau Las Vegas opened on the site of the former El Rancho Hotel and Casino and Algiers Hotel.

===Future developments===

The Tropicana was demolished in October 2024. It will be replaced with a new Bally&#x27;s Las Vegas resort and New Las Vegas Stadium which will become the home of the The Athletics after they relocate to Las Vegas from their temporary home in Sacramento. The Mirage also closed in July 2024, but will reopen as the Hard Rock Las Vegas.

BLVD is opening in early 2025.

==Transportation==

=== Buses ===
RTC Transit (previously Citizens Area Transit, or CAT) provides bus service on the Strip with double decker buses known as The Deuce. The Deuce runs between the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign and South Strip Transfer Terminal to the Bonneville Transit Center (BTC) and the Fremont Street Experience in Downtown Las Vegas, with stops near every casino.

=== Trams ===
Several free trams operate between properties on the west side of the Strip:


=== Monorail ===
While not on the Strip itself, the Las Vegas Monorail runs a 3.9-mile route on the east side of the Strip corridor from Tropicana Avenue to Sahara Avenue, with stops every 4 to 8 minutes at several on-Strip properties including the MGM Grand and the Sahara at each end of the route. The stations include:

* SAHARA Las Vegas Station
* Westgate Station
* Las Vegas Convention Center Station
* Harrah&#x27;s/The LINQ Station
* Flamingo/Caesars Palace Station
* Horseshoe/Paris Station
* MGM Grand Station

The monorail began operating in 1995 with two trains from Walt Disney World. In 2020, the monorail was acquired by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA).

===Pedestrian traffic===

Tens of thousands of pedestrians are walking along the Strip at any given time. As of 2019, about 50,000 pedestrians walked the Strip on an average day.

In the 1990s, several pedestrian footbridges were erected over Las Vegas Boulevard to increase pedestrian safety and alleviate traffic congestion at popular intersections. The first was the Tropicana ‚Äì Las Vegas Boulevard footbridge. Some mimic the theme of nearby resorts.. The footbridges include:

# Veer Towers: Connects Veer Towers, Waldorf Astoria, and Crystals Shopping Center
# Park MGM and T-Mobile Arena Park: Connects MGM and Showcase Mall
# Planet Hollywood: Connects Planet Hollywood, CityCenter, Crystals Shopping Center, and The Cosmopolitan.
# Spring Mountain Road and Las Vegas Blvd. Corner: Connects Treasure Island, the Wynn, Fashion Show Mall, and The Venetian
# Flamingo Road and Las Vegas Blvd. Corner: Connects Bally&#x27;s, Flamingo, Bellagio, and Caesars Palace
# Las Vegas Blvd and Tropicana Ave Corner. Connects the MGM Grand, New York-New York, Excalibur, and Tropicana

=== Taxis ===

Taxis are available at resorts, shopping centers, attractions, and for scheduled pickups. The Nevada Taxicab Authority provides information about taxi fares and fare zones. In 2021, there was an increase in taxi passengers due to declines in rideshare drivers and rideshare surge pricing.

==Attractions on the Strip==

=== Gambling ===
In 2019, about eight in ten (81%) visitors said they gambled while in Las Vegas, the highest proportion in the past five years. The average time spent gambling, 2.7 hours, represents an increase over the past three years. Also, the average trip gambling budget, $591.06, was increased from 2018. About nine in ten (89%) visitors who gambled did so on the Strip Corridor. UNLV reported that in 2019, Big Las Vegas Strip Casinos (defined as Strip casinos with more than $72M in annual gaming revenues) had more than $6B in annual gaming revenues, corresponding to about 26% of total annual revenues.

From the time period spanning 1985 to 2019, there have been some changes in the mix of table games in casinos on the Strip:

* Blackjack: The number of tables decreased from 77% in 1985 to 50% in 2019. Revenue decreased from 50% in 1985 to 11% in 2019.
* Craps: Revenue decreased from 28% in 1985 to 11% in 2019.
* Roulette: Both the number of tables and revenue increased by 50%.
* Baccarat: About 2% of tables and 13% revenue in 1985 to 13% of tables and 37% of revenue in 2019.
* Additional games: Games such as pai gow poker, three-card poker, and mini-baccarat have increased in popularity, number of tables, and revenue.
Casino operators have been expanding sports betting facilities and products, as well as renovating and upgrading equipment and facilities. Although sports betting has a relatively low margin, the high-end sportsbooks can generate significant amounts of revenue in other areas, such as food and drink. As a result, sportsbooks have been expanding and upgrading food and drink offerings. High-end sportsbooks include features such as single-seat stadium-style seating, large high-definition screens, a dedicated broadcast booth, and the ability to watch up to 15 sporting events at once. The sports network ESPN is broadcasting sports betting shows from a dedicated studio at The Linq. Some sportsbooks are now offering self-service betting kiosks.

===Entertainment===
The Las Vegas Strip is known for its lounges, showrooms, theaters and nightclubs, most on the hotel casino properties. Some of the more popular free attractions visible from the Strip include the water fountains at Bellagio, the volcano at The Mirage (now shuttered with the closing of The Mirage), and the Fall of Atlantis and Festival Fountain at Caesars Palace. There are several Cirque du Soleil shows, such as &quot;K√†&quot; at the MGM Grand, &quot;O&quot; at Bellagio, &quot;Myst√®re&quot; at Treasure Island, and &quot;Michael Jackson: One&quot; at Mandalay Bay.

Many notable artists have performed in Las Vegas, including Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Wayne Newton, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Louis Prima, Rod Stewart and Liberace, and in more recent years Celine Dion, Britney Spears, Barry Manilow, Cher, Elton John, Bette Midler, Diana Ross, Donny and Marie Osmond, Garth Brooks, Jennifer Lopez, Reba McEntire, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, Kylie Minogue, Shania Twain, Criss Angel, Olivia Newton-John, Queen + Adam Lambert, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Gwen Stefani have had residencies in the various resorts on the Strip. During 2019, 51% of visitors attended shows, which was down from 2015, 2017, and 2018. Among visitors who saw shows, relatively more went to Broadway/production shows than in past years, while relatively fewer saw lounge acts, comedy shows, or celebrity DJs.

The Strip also hosts the Las Vegas Grand Prix which has been part of the Formula One World Championship since 2023. It will also house the New Las Vegas Stadium for the Oakland Athletics in 2028 when the team relocates to the Las Vegas Valley.

===Golf===

The Aladdin had a nine-hole golf course in the 1960s. As land values on the Strip have increased over the years, the resort-affiliated golf courses have been removed to make way for building projects. The Tropicana Country Club closed in 1990 and the Dunes golf course in the mid-90s. Steve Wynn, founder of previously owned Mirage Resorts, purchased the Desert Inn and golf course for his new company Wynn Resorts and redeveloped the course as the Wynn Golf Club. This course closed in 2017, but the development planned for the course was cancelled and the course was renovated and re-opened in late 2019. In 2000, Bali Hai Golf Club opened just south of Mandalay Bay and the Strip. In 2016, a TopGolf opened near the Strip.

===Amusement parks and rides===
Adventuredome indoor amusement park at Circus Circus on the Strip is a major tourist attraction; it is enclosed in glass, with a carousel, mini-golf, two roller coasters, bowling, spinning rides, an arcade, virtual reality rides, a carnival midway, and clown shows.

The Stratosphere tower has several rides:
*Big Shot
*X-Scream
*SkyJump Las Vegas
*Insanity (inactive)

Other rides on the Strip include:
*Big Apple Coaster (formerly known as Manhattan Express (1997-2006) and The Roller Coaster (2007-2015))
*High Roller
*Fly Linq

== Sustainability ==

Although the Strip has elaborate displays, fountains, and large buffet restaurants, many of the hotel resort properties are renowned for their sustainability efforts, including:

* Water conservation: Approaches include reclaiming water and placing it back into Lake Mead, using minimal outdoor landscaping, upgrading toilets, using low-flow showerheads, and setting goals for water conservation.
* Recycling: In 2017, the recycling rate in Clark County was about 20%, while the recycling rate for major hotels on the Strip was about 40%.
* Food handling: Leftover food is composted or sent to agricultural farms. Untouched, undisturbed food is donated to local food banks.
*Energy efficiency: Hotels have updated appliances in rooms, installed LED lighting, and installed wireless lighting control systems.

Renewable energy is generated and used on the Strip. MGM initiated solar power when it built a solar array on top of the Mandalay Bay in 2014 and expanded it in 2016. The solar array at the Mandalay Bay, a 28-acre system capable of powering 1,300 homes, is one of the largest commercial rooftop solar arrays in the United States. The solar array includes more than 26,000 solar panels capable of providing a total of 8.3 megawatts DC (6.5 megawatts AC), sufficient for powering 25% of the Mandalay Bay campus.

Energy-efficient buildings are also being implemented and the Strip has one of the highest concentrations of LEED-certified buildings in the world. Some examples of LEED-certified buildings are the Octavius Tower at Caesars Palace and the Linq Promenade, both of which are certified LEED Silver.

<text>Ray casting is the methodological basis for 3D CAD/CAM solid modeling and image rendering. It is essentially the same as ray tracing for computer graphics where virtual light rays are &quot;cast&quot; or &quot;traced&quot; on their path from the focal point of a camera through each pixel in the camera sensor to determine what is visible along the ray in the 3D scene. 

The term &quot;Ray Casting&quot; was introduced by Scott Roth while at the General Motors Research Labs from 1978‚Äì1980. His paper, &quot;Ray Casting for Modeling Solids&quot;, describes modeled solid objects by combining primitive solids, such as blocks and cylinders, using the set operators union (+), intersection (&amp;), and difference (‚àí). The general idea of using these binary operators for solid modeling is largely due to Voelcker and Requicha&#x27;s geometric modelling group at the University of Rochester. See &quot;solid modeling&quot; for a broad overview of solid modeling methods.

Before ray casting (and ray tracing), computer graphics algorithms projected surfaces or edges (e.g., lines) from the 3D world to the image plane where visibility logic had to be applied. The world-to-image plane projection is a 3D homogeneous coordinate system transformation, also known as 3D projection, affine transformation, or projective transform (homography). Rendering an image this way is difficult to achieve with hidden surface/edge removal. Plus, silhouettes of curved surfaces have to be explicitly solved for whereas it is an implicit by-product of ray casting, so there is no need to explicitly solve for it whenever the view changes.

Ray casting greatly simplified image rendering of 3D objects and scenes because a line transforms to a line. So, instead of projecting curved edges and surfaces in the 3D scene to the 2D image plane, transformed lines (rays) are intersected with the objects in the scene. A homogeneous coordinate transformation is represented by a 4√ó4 matrix. The mathematical technique is common to computer graphics and geometric modeling. A transform includes rotations around the three axes, independent scaling along the axes, translations in 3D, and even skewing. Transforms are easily concatenated via matrix arithmetic. For use with a 4√ó4 matrix, a point is represented by [X, Y, Z, 1], and a direction vector is represented by [Dx, Dy, Dz, 0]. (The fourth term is for translation, which does not apply to direction vectors.)

== Concept ==

Ray casting is the most basic of many computer graphics rendering algorithms that use the geometric algorithm of ray tracing. Ray tracing-based rendering algorithms operate in image order to render three-dimensional scenes to two-dimensional images. Geometric rays are traced from the eye of the observer to sample the light (radiance) travelling toward the observer from the ray direction. The speed and simplicity of ray casting comes from computing the color of the light without recursively tracing additional rays that sample the radiance incident on the point that the ray hit. This eliminates the possibility of accurately rendering reflections, refractions, or the natural falloff of shadows; however all of these elements can be faked to a degree, by creative use of texture maps or other methods. The high speed of calculation made ray casting a handy rendering method in early real-time 3D video games.

The idea behind ray casting is to trace rays from the eye, one per pixel, and find the closest object blocking the path of that ray‚Äîthink of an image as a screen-door, with each square in the screen being a pixel. This is then the object the eye sees through that pixel. Using the material properties and the effect of the lights in the scene, this algorithm can determine the shading of this object. The simplifying assumption is made that if a surface faces a light, the light will reach that surface and not be blocked or in shadow. The shading of the surface is computed using traditional 3D computer graphics shading models. One important advantage ray casting offered over older scanline algorithms was its ability to easily deal with non-planar surfaces and solids, such as cones and spheres. If a mathematical surface can be intersected by a ray, it can be rendered using ray casting. Elaborate objects can be created by using solid modelling techniques and easily rendered.

From the abstract for the paper &quot;Ray Casting for Modeling Solids&quot;: 
To visualize and analyze the composite solids modeled, virtual light rays are cast as probes. By virtue of its simplicity, ray casting is reliable and extensible. The most difficult mathematical problem is finding line-surface intersection points. So, surfaces as planes, quadrics, tori, and probably even parametric surface patches may bound the primitive solids. The adequacy and efficiency of ray casting are issues addressed here. A fast picture generation capability for interactive modeling is the biggest challenge.

Light rays and the camera geometry form the basis for all geometric reasoning here. This figure shows a pinhole camera model for perspective effect in image processing and a parallel camera model for mass analysis. The simple pinhole camera model consists of a focal point (or eye point) and a square pixel array (or screen). Straight light rays pass through the pixel array to connect the focal point with the scene, one ray per pixel. To shade pictures, the rays‚Äô intensities are measured and stored as pixels. The reflecting surface responsible for a pixel‚Äôs value intersects the pixel‚Äôs ray.

When the focal length, distance between focal point and screen, is infinite, then the view is called ‚Äúparallel‚Äù because all light rays are parallel to each other, perpendicular to the screen. Although the perspective view is natural for making pictures, some applications need rays that can be uniformly distributed in space.

=== Concept Model ===
For modeling convenience, a typical standard coordinate system for the camera has the screen in the X‚ÄìY plane, the scene in the +Z half space, and the focal point on the ‚àíZ axis.
A &lt;dfn style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;ray&lt;/dfn&gt; is simply a straight line in the 3D space of the camera model. It is best defined in parameterized form as a point vector (X0, Y0, Z0) and a direction vector (Dx, Dy, Dz). In this form, points on the line are ordered and accessed via a single parameter t. For every value of t, a corresponding point (X, Y, Z) on the line is defined:

 X = X0 + t ¬∑ Dx
 Y = Y0 + t ¬∑ Dy
 Z = Z0 + t ¬∑ Dz

If the vector is normalized, then the parameter t is distance along the line. The vector can be normalized easily with the following computation:

 Dist = ‚àö(Dx2 + Dy2 + Dz2)
 D&#x27;x = Dx / Dist
 D&#x27;y = Dy / Dist
 D&#x27;z = Dz / Dist

Given geometric definitions of the objects, each bounded by one or more surfaces, the result of computing one ray‚Äôs intersection with all bounded surfaces in the screen is defined by two arrays:

 Ray parameters: &quot;t&quot;[1], &quot;t&quot;[2], ‚Ä¶, &quot;t&quot;[n]
 Surface pointers: S[1], S[2], ‚Ä¶, S[n]

Where n is the number of ray-surface intersections. The ordered list of ray parameters, t[i], denote the enter‚Äìexit points. The ray enters a solid at point t[1], exits at t[2], enters a solid at t[3], etc. Point t[1] is closest to the camera and t[n] is furthest. 

In association with the ray parameters, the surface pointers contain a unique address for the intersected surface‚Äôs information. The surface can have various properties such as color, specularity, transparency with/without refraction, translucency, etc. The solid associated with the surface may have its own physical properties such as density. This could be useful, for instance, when an object consists of an assembly of different materials and the overall center of mass and moments of inertia are of interest.

== Ray Casting Applications ==

Three algorithms using ray casting are to make line drawings, to make shaded pictures, and to compute volumes and other physical properties. Each algorithm, given a camera model, casts one ray per pixel in the screen. For computing volume, the resolution of the pixel screen to use depends on the desired accuracy of the solution. For line drawings and picture shading, the resolution determines the quality of the image.
=== Line Drawings ===

To draw the visible edges of a solid, generate one ray per pixel moving top-down, left-right in the screen. Evaluate each ray in order to identify the visible surface S[1], the first surface pointer in the sorted list of ray-surface intersections. If the visible surface at pixel location (X, Y) is different than the visible surface at pixel (X‚àí1, Y), then display a vertical line one pixel long centered at (X‚àí¬Ω, Y). Similarly, if the visible surface at (X, Y) is different than the visible surface at pixel (X, Y‚àí1), then display a horizontal line one pixel long centered at (X, Y‚àí¬Ω). The resulting drawing will consist of horizontal and vertical edges only, looking jagged in coarse resolutions.

Roth‚Äôs ray casting system generated the images of solid objects on the right. Box enclosures, dynamic bounding, and coherence were used for optimization. For each picture, the screen was sampled with a density of about 100√ó100 (e.g., 10,000) rays and new edges were located via binary searches. Then all edges were followed by casting additional rays at one pixel increments on the two sides of the edges. Each picture was drawn on a Tektronix tube at 780√ó780 resolution.

=== Shaded Pictures ===
To make a shaded picture, again cast one ray per pixel in the screen. This time, however, use the visible surface pointer S[1] at each pixel to access the description of the surface. From this, compute the surface normal at the visible point &quot;t&quot;[1]. The pixel‚Äôs value, the displayable light intensity, is proportional to the cosine of the angle formed by the surface normal and the light-source-to-surface vector. Processing all pixels this way produces a raster-type picture of the scene.

=== Computing Volume and Moments of Inertia ===
The volume (and similar properties) of a solid bounded by curved surfaces is easily computed by the ‚Äúapproximating sums‚Äù integration method, by approximating the solid with a set of rectangular parallelepipeds. This is accomplished by taking an ‚Äúin-depth‚Äù picture of the solid in a parallel view. Casting rays through the screen into the solid partitions the solid into volume elements. Two dimensions of the parallelepipeds are constant, defined by the 2D spacing of rays in the screen. The third dimension is variable, defined by the enter‚Äìexit point computed. Specifically, if the horizontal and vertical distances between rays in the screen is S, then the volume ‚Äúdetected‚Äù by each ray is:

 S √ó S √ó (&quot;t&quot;[2]-&quot;t&quot;[1] + &quot;t&quot;[4]-&quot;t&quot;[3] + ‚Ä¶ + &quot;t&quot;[n]-&quot;t&quot;[n-1]) / L

where L is defined as the length of the direction vector. (If already normalized, this is equal to 1.)

 L = ‚àö(Dx2 + Dy2 + Dz2)

Each (&quot;t&quot;[&quot;i&quot;]-&quot;t&quot;[&quot;i&quot;-1])/L is a length of a ray segment that is inside of the solid.

This figure shows the parallelepipeds for a modeled solid using ray casting. This is a use of parallel-projection camera model.

== In‚ÄìOut Ray Classification ==
This figure shows an example of the binary operators in a composition tree using ‚Äú+‚Äù and ‚Äú‚àí‚Äù where a single ray is evaluated.

The ray casting procedure starts at the top of the solid composition tree, recursively descends to the bottom, classifies the ray with respect to the primitive solids, and then returns up the tree combining the classifications of the left and right subtrees.

This figure illustrates the combining of the left and right classifications for all three binary operators.
== Realistic shaded pictures ==

Ray casting is a natural modeling tool for making shaded pictures. The grayscale ray-casting system developed by Scott Roth and Daniel Bass at GM Research Labs produced pictures on a Ramtek color raster display around 1979. To compose pictures, the system provided the user with the following controls:

This figure shows a table scene with shadows from two point light sources.

Shading algorithms that implement all of the realistic effects are computationally expensive, but relatively simple. For example, the following figure shows the additional rays that could be cast for a single light source.

For a single pixel in the image to be rendered, the algorithm casts a ray starting at the focal point and determines that it intersects a semi-transparent rectangle and a shiny circle. An additional ray must then be cast starting at that point in the direction symmetrically opposite the surface normal at the ray-surface intersection point in order to determine what is visible in the mirrored reflection. That ray intersects the triangle which is opaque. Finally, each ray-surface intersection point is tested to determine if it is in shadow. The ‚ÄúShadow feeler‚Äù ray is cast from the ray-surface intersection point to the light source to determine if any other surface blocks that pathway.

Turner Whitted calls the secondary and additional rays ‚ÄúRecursive Ray Tracing‚Äù. [A room of mirrors would be costly to render, so limiting the number of recursions is prudent.] Whitted modeled refraction for transparencies by generating a secondary ray from the visible surface point at an angle determined by the solid‚Äôs index of refraction. The secondary ray is then processed as a specular ray. For the refraction formula and pictorial examples, see Whitted‚Äôs paper.

== Enclosures and efficiency ==

Ray casting qualifies as a brute force method for solving problems. The minimal algorithm is simple, particularly in consideration of its many applications and ease of use, but applications typically cast many rays. Millions of rays may be cast to render a single frame of an animated film. Computer processing time increases with the resolution of the screen and the number of primitive solids/surfaces in the composition.
By using minimum bounding boxes around the solids in the composition tree, the exhaustive search for a ray-solid intersection resembles an efficient binary search. The brute force algorithm does an exhaustive search because it always visits all the nodes in the tree‚Äîtransforming the ray into primitives‚Äô local coordinate systems, testing for ray-surface intersections, and combining the classifications‚Äîeven when the ray clearly misses the solid. In order to detect a ‚Äúclear miss‚Äù, a faster algorithm uses the binary composition tree as a hierarchical representation of the space that the solid composition occupies. But all position, shape, and size information is stored at the leaves of the tree where primitive solids reside. The top and intermediate nodes in the tree only specify combine operators.

Characterizing with enclosures the space that all solids fill gives all nodes in the tree an abstract summary of position and size information. Then, the quick ‚Äúray intersects enclosure‚Äù tests guide the search in the hierarchy. When the test fails at an intermediate node in the tree, the ray is guaranteed to classify as out of the composite, so recursing down its subtrees to further investigate is unnecessary.

Accurately assessing the cost savings for using enclosures is difficult because it depends on the spatial distribution of the primitives (the complexity distribution) and on the organization of the composition tree. The optimal conditions are:

* No primitive enclosures overlap in space
* Composition tree is balanced and organized so that sub-solids near in space are also nearby in the tree

In contrast, the worst condition is:

* All primitive enclosures mutually overlap

The following are miscellaneous performance improvements made in Roth‚Äôs paper on ray casting, but there have been considerable improvements subsequently made by others.

;Early Outs
:If the operator at a composite node in the tree is ‚àí or &amp; and the ray classifies as out of the composite‚Äôs left sub-solid, then the ray will classify as out of the composite regardless of the ray‚Äôs classification with respect to the right sub-solid. So, classifying the ray with respect to the right sub-solid is unnecessary and should be avoided for efficiency.
;Transformations
:By initially combining the screen-to-scene transform with the primitive‚Äôs scene-to-local transform and storing the resulting screen-to-local transforms in the primitive‚Äôs data structures, one ray transform per ray-surface intersection is eliminated.
;Recursion
:Given a deep composition tree, recursion can be expensive in combination with allocating and freeing up memory. Recursion can be simulated using static arrays as stacks.
;Dynamic Bounding
:If only the visible edges of the solid are to be displayed, the ray casting algorithm can dynamically bound the ray to cut off the search. That is, after finding that a ray intersects a sub-solid, the algorithm can use the intersection point closest to the screen to tighten the depth bound for the ‚Äúray intersections box‚Äù test. This only works for the + part of the tree, starting at the top. With ‚Äì and &amp;, nearby ‚Äúin‚Äù parts of the ray may later become ‚Äúout‚Äù.
;Coherence
:The principle of coherence is that the surfaces visible at two neighboring pixels are more likely to be the same than different. Developers of computer graphics and vision systems have applied this empirical truth for efficiency and performance. For line drawings, the image area containing edges is normally much less than the total image area, so ray casting should be concentrated around the edges and not in the open regions. This can be effectively implemented by sparsely sampling the screen with rays and then locating, when neighboring rays identify different visible surfaces, the edges via binary searches.

== Anti-aliasing ==

The jagged edges caused by aliasing is an undesirable effect of point sampling techniques and is a classic problem with raster display algorithms. Linear or smoothly curved edges will appear jagged and are particularly objectionable in animations because movement of the image makes the edges appear fuzzy or look like little moving escalators. Also, details in the scene smaller than the spacing between rays may be lost. The jagged edges in a line drawing can be smoothed by edge following. The purpose of such an algorithm is to minimize the number of lines needed to draw the picture within one pixel accuracy. Smooth edges result. The line drawings above were drawn this way.

To smooth the jagged edges in a shaded picture with subpixel accuracy, additional rays should be cast for information about the edges. (See Supersampling for a general approach.) Edges are formed by the intersection of surfaces or by the profile of a curved surface. Applying &quot;Coherence&quot; as described above via binary search, if the visible surface at pixel (X,Y) is different than the visible surface at pixel (X+1,Y), then a ray could be generated midway between them at (X+¬Ω,Y) and the visible surface there identified. The distance between sample points could be further subdivided, but the search need not be deep. The primary search depth to smooth jagged edges is a function of the intensity gradient across the edge. The cost for smoothing jagged edges is affordable, since:

* the area of the image that contains edges is usually a small percentage of the total area; and
* the extra rays cast in binary searches can be bounded in depth (that of the visible primitives forming the edges).

== History of ray casting ==

For the history of ray casting, see ray tracing (graphics) as both are essentially the same technique under different names. Scott Roth had invented the term &quot;ray casting&quot; before having heard of &quot;ray tracing&quot;. Additionally, Scott Roth&#x27;s development of ray casting at GM Research Labs occurred concurrently with Turner Whitted&#x27;s ray tracing work at Bell Labs.

== Ray casting in early computer games ==

In early first person games, raycasting was used to efficiently render a 3D world from a 2D playing field using a simple one-dimensional scan over the horizontal width of the screen. Early first-person shooters used 2D ray casting as a technique to create a 3D effect from a 2D world. While the world appears 3D, the player cannot look up or down or only in limited angles with shearing distortion. This style of rendering eliminates the need to fire a ray for each pixel in the frame as is the case with modern engines; once the hit point is found the projection distortion is applied to the surface texture and an entire vertical column is copied from the result into the frame. This style of rendering also imposes limitations on the type of rendering which can be performed, for example depth sorting but depth buffering may not. That is polygons must be full in front of or behind one another, they may not partially overlap or intersect.

===&quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;===

The video game &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; was built from a square based grid of uniform height walls meeting solid-colored floors and ceilings. In order to draw the world, a single ray was traced for every column of screen pixels and a vertical slice of wall texture was selected and scaled according to where in the world the ray hits a wall and how far it travels before doing so.

The purpose of the grid based levels was twofold ‚Äî ray-wall collisions can be found more quickly since the potential hits become more predictable and memory overhead is reduced. However, encoding wide-open areas takes extra space.

===&quot;ShadowCaster&quot;===

The Raven Software game &quot;ShadowCaster&quot; uses an improved Wolfenstein-based engine with added floors and ceilings texturing and variable wall heights.

=== &quot;Comanche&quot; series ===

The Voxel Space engine developed by NovaLogic for the &quot;Comanche&quot; games traced a ray through each column of screen pixels and tested each ray against points in a heightmap. Then it transformed each element of the heightmap into a column of pixels, determined which are visible (that is, have not been occluded by pixels that have been drawn in front), and drew them with the corresponding color from the texture map.

=== Beyond raycasting ===

Later DOS games like &quot;id Software&#x27;s DOOM&quot; kept many of the raycasting 2.5D restrictions for speed but went on to switch to alternative rendering techniques (like BSP), making them no longer raycasting engines.

== Computational geometry setting ==
In computational geometry, the ray casting problem is also known as the ray shooting problem and may be stated as the following query problem: given a set of objects in &quot;d&quot;-dimensional space, preprocess them into a data structure so that for each query ray, the initial object hit by the ray can be found quickly. The problem has been investigated for various settings: space dimension, types of objects, restrictions on query rays, etc. One technique is to use a sparse voxel octree.

<text>The Torrey pine (Pinus torreyana) is a rare pine species in California, United States. It is a critically endangered species growing only in coastal San Diego County, and on Santa Rosa Island, offshore from Santa Barbara in Santa Barbara County. The Torrey pine is endemic to the California coastal sage and chaparral ecoregion.

==Taxonomy==
The species epithet &quot;torreyana&quot; is named for John Torrey, an American botanist, after whom the coniferous genus &quot;Torreya&quot; is also named.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus torreyana&quot; is a broad, open-crowned pine tree growing to tall in the wild, with long leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) in groups of five. The cones are stout and heavy, typically long and broad, and contain large, hard-shelled, but edible, pine nuts. Like all pines, its needles are clustered into &#x27;fascicles&#x27; that have a particular number of needles for each pine species; in the Torrey pine there are five needles in each fascicle. Like all pines, it has strobili, structures that function as a flower but look like a small cone, which for the Torrey pine look like a yellow bud in a male strobilus and like a small red cone in a female.

Torrey pines are sometimes afflicted with witch&#x27;s broom (or &quot;gorilla&#x27;s nest&quot;), an unusually dense cluster of needles that looks somewhat like a bird&#x27;s nest, caused by disease or other causes.

There are two subspecies or varieties. These are said to be distinguished by the following characteristics, as well as possibly differing in the terpenoid (beta-phellandrene, limonene, cineole, etc.) profile.
==Distribution==
The extant population of &quot;Pinus torreyana&quot; is restricted to trees growing in a narrow strip along the Southern California coast in San Diego. There is also a population of the variety Pinus torreyana&quot; var. &quot;insularis in two groves on Santa Rosa Island, a California Channel Island off the coast of Santa Barbara. The presence of Torrey pines along the semi-arid coast of San Diego and Santa Rosa Island (rainfall less than 15 inches per year) is probably a relict population of a much more extensive Ice Age distribution. Coastal fog during spring and summer along the San Diego and Santa Rosa Island coast provides just enough moisture to supplement the fairly low winter rainfall, allowing for survival of the species in the wild habitat zone.

==Ecology==
The native habitat of &quot;Pinus torreyana&quot; is coastal sage scrub, a plant community, growing slowly in dry, sandy soil. The root system is extensive. A tiny seedling may quickly send a taproot down seeking moisture and nutrients. A mature tree may have roots extending . Exposed trees battered by coastal winds are often twisted into beautiful sculptural shapes resembling large bonsai, and rarely exceed tall.

The seeds are eaten by birds and rodents. Like most pine tree species, the seeds have a wing attached to them, but in this species it is papery, breaks off easily, and is entirely non-functional, so this tree is entirely reliant upon animals to disperse its seeds. The scrub jay (&quot;Aphelocoma californica&quot;) is the most important species when it comes to dispersal of the seeds (on the mainland). Scrub jays and perhaps also squirrels are thought to be spreading the species into adjacent parklands from gardens around San Diego.

The caterpillars of the moth &quot;Gloveria arizonensis&quot; have been confirmed to feed on this tree in the wild.

Stratification, which is the process of subjecting seeds to (moist) cold, encourages germination in Torrey pine seeds

==Uses==

===Food===
The pine nuts were once eaten by the Kumeyaay tribe of Native American people.

===Cultivation===
Although considered endangered in the wild, Torrey pine is often planted as an ornamental tree around San Diego, coastal and inland southern California, and even the Central Valley. A single tree planted in a suburb of San Diego in the 1940s or 1950s has grown tall and straight, and to a large size, . Shipley Nature Center states it can grow to in height in cultivation. It is sold by at least ten different plant nurseries in California as of 2020.

===Forestry===
&quot;Pinus torreyana&quot; has been considered as a plantation tree for forestry use in Australia, New Zealand and Kenya.

===Culture===
In San Diego County it is considered a local icon, where it lends its name to Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve, Torrey Pines State Beach, Torrey Pines Golf Course, Torrey Pines High School, and Torrey Pines Gliderport, as well as numerous local roads, parks, and businesses (e.g., Torrey Pines Bank, Torrey Pines Property Management Company, Torrey Pines Landscape Company, and Torrey Pines Law Group.)

==Conservation==
There is some disagreement about the total population of &quot;Pinus torreyana&quot;. In general, only the populations in Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve and on Santa Rosa Island are deemed to count as the wild population, not the trees planted around San Diego and wider California. In the 1970s it was estimated that the population in the TPSR and on Santa Rosa Island was about 9,000 individuals, but many of these trees have since died due to forest fires, drought and a series of infestations of a bark beetle, as well as being stressed by air pollution. There were only a hundred trees surviving in the early 20th century. As of 2016 it is thought by the California Native Plant Society that the population of this species is some 3,000 individuals. In 2011, Aljos Farjon, assessing the conservation status of this species for the IUCN, estimated that the total population of &quot;P. torreyana&quot; was 4,500 individuals. He states that there is a slow decline of the numbers, especially of the trees not found within the TPSR on the mainland.

The Torrey pine is protected by a city tree ordinance in Del Mar, near the native habitat, and construction projects and citizens require a permit for its removal.

<doc id="447630" wikidata="Q441832" url="?curid=447630" title="James Michael Curley">
<text>James Michael Curley (November 20, 1874 ‚Äì November 12, 1958) was an American Democratic politician from Boston, Massachusetts. He served four terms as mayor of Boston between 1914 and 1955. Curley ran for mayor in every election for which he was legally qualified. He was twice convicted of criminal behavior and notably served time in prison during his last term as mayor. He also served a single term as governor of Massachusetts. He is remembered as one of the most colorful figures in Massachusetts politics.

Curley also served two terms, separated by 30 years, in the United States House of Representatives and, in his early career, served in the Boston Common Council, Boston Board of Aldermen, and Massachusetts House of Representatives.

Curley was immensely popular with his fellow working class Roman Catholic Irish Americans. During the Great Depression in the United States, he raised taxes and spent freely on various improvements. He enlarged Boston City Hospital, expanded the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, funded projects to improve roads and bridges, and improved the neighborhoods with beaches and bathhouses, playgrounds and parks, public schools, and libraries. In addition to their own benefits, these projects provided jobs, needed by the working class during the Depression. At the same time he was regularly collecting bribes, kickbacks, and other graft. 

He was a leading and at times divisive force in the Massachusetts Democratic Party, challenging Boston&#x27;s ward bosses and the party&#x27;s white Anglo-Saxon Protestant leadership at the local and state levels. His political tactics, which tended to drive businesses and economically successful people from the city, damaging the local economy, have become an object of study for economists and political scientists. A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Curley as the fourth-worst American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993.

==Early life==
James Michael Curley was born in Boston&#x27;s Roxbury neighborhood in 1874 to Michael and Sarah Curley (n√©e Clancy).

Curley&#x27;s father Michael immigrated from Oughterard, County Galway, Ireland and settled in Roxbury, where he met Curley&#x27;s mother, also from County Galway. Michael Curley worked as a day laborer and foot soldier for Democratic ward boss P. James &quot;Pea-Jacket&quot; Maguire.

Michael Curley died in 1884, when his son James was ten.

James and his brother John worked to supplement the meager family income, while James took classes at the local public school. Curley left school at fifteen and took jobs in factory work and delivery which exposed him to much of the growing industrial city of Boston. He sought to become a fire fighter but was too young to take the job.

His mother is likely responsible for instilling in him the strain of generosity that would make up a significant part of his public personality. Curley&#x27;s mother continually intervened to turn him away from his father&#x27;s unsavory associates while working at a job scrubbing floors in offices and churches all over Boston.

==Political rise==
As Curley came of age, Boston politics were marked by growing Irish political power in opposition to traditional Yankee Protestantism. Curley involved himself in the local Roman Catholic church and the Ancient Order of Hibernians, a fraternal benefit society that assisted Irish immigrants. He acquired a reputation as a hustler who was willing to help others get ahead.

Curley gained experience in the traditional practices of ward politics such as knocking on doors, drumming up votes, and taking complaints. He ran for a seat on the Boston Common Council in 1897 and 1898, but failed to achieve the Democratic nomination in ward caucuses each year. Curley claimed he was denied victory by corrupt vote counting, rigged against him because he was outside the political machine.

Curley was successful in 1899 by joining the machine faction controlled by Charles I. Quirk. In his first two years on the Council, Curley placed roughly 700 people into patronage positions. His reputation as an urban populist earned him the unofficial title &quot;Mayor of the Poor.&quot;

===Boston Common Council (1900)===
In 1900 Curley became the youngest ward boss in Boston at 26 years of age. He obtained through political maneuvering positions on Boston&#x27;s Board of Aldermen. Curley became a member of the Boston Common Council in 1901, representing the seventeenth ward.

===State Representative (1902‚Äì03)===
Curley won election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1901 and became the chair of the Ward 17 Democratic organization. He established the Tammany Club (named in a nod to the New York City Tammany Hall political club) as a platform for his personal political activities, including speechmaking and assisting needy constituents. Curley later recounted stories of the ward&#x27;s poor and needy lining up outside the club&#x27;s office to ask for work or subsistence.

===Boston Board of Aldermen (1905‚Äì1909)===
Curley served on the Boston Board of Aldermen from 1905 until 1909, when the Boston Board of Alderman and the Boston City Council were merged to become the unicameral Boston City Council.

Curley&#x27;s first public notoriety came from being elected to Boston&#x27;s board of aldermen in 1904 while imprisoned on a fraud conviction. The charge resulted after Curley and the unrelated Thomas Curley had helped two applicants in their district cheat on federal civil service exams for postmen, by criminally impersonating the applicants and taking the exams for them. Though the incident gave him a dark reputation in Boston&#x27;s non-Irish circles, it aided his image among the Irish American working class and poor because they saw him as a man willing to stick his neck out to help those in need. During that election, his campaign slogan was, &quot;he did it for a friend.&quot; He also quickly gained a reputation for taking kickbacks in exchange for his support.

In January 1909, after the board had been unable to garner the required consensus to elect a new board chairman, Curley briefly served as the &quot;acting&quot; chairman. On January 26, 1909, the board elected Frederick J. Brand its permanent chairman.

===U.S. Congress (1911‚Äì1914)===

In 1910, while a member of Boston&#x27;s board of aldermen, Curley challenged U.S. Representative Joseph F. O&#x27;Connell, a fellow Democrat.

His first preference was to run for mayor of Boston, but former Mayor (and czar of Boston Irish politics) John &quot;Honey Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald ran for the office. In exchange for Curley staying out of the mayoral race, Fitzgerald promised not to run for re-election after a single four-year term. In the previous election for the seat, O&#x27;Connell won by a four-vote margin over his Republican opponent, ex-City Clerk J. Mitchel Galvin.

In a three-way primary among O&#x27;Connell, Curley, and O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s predecessor William S. McNary, Curley defeated O&#x27;Connell and McNary. After winning the nomination of the Democratic Party, Curley went on to win the general election by a substantial plurality over Galvin, who was again the Republican nominee.

==First mayoralty (1914‚Äì1918)==
Despite his deal with Curley, Mayor Fitzgerald did run for re-election in the election held in January 1914. Curley secured Fitzgerald&#x27;s exit from the race by threatening to expose a dalliance the older man had with a cigarette girl in a Boston gambling den. Curley was aided by Daniel H. Coakley, a lawyer whose specialties included extortion and bribing prosecutors to bury criminal charges against his clients. Fitzgerald withdrew, and Curley won the election over City Council president Thomas Kenny.

Curley&#x27;s victory marked his consolidation of control over Boston politics, which he would retain until 1950. He served four separate terms as mayor (1914‚Äì1918, 1922‚Äì1926, 1930‚Äì1934 and 1946‚Äì1950) and always held influence even when he wasn&#x27;t in that office.

In his first term, Curley embarked on a series of public improvements, a practice he continued in his later terms as mayor. His projects included the development of recreational facilities in the poorer parts of the city, expansion of public transit, and an enlargement of Boston City Hospital. He accomplished this with little regard for city finances, raising property taxes and securing loans from city banks, sometimes by threatening city inspectional actions against bank facilities. He deliberately tweaked the sensibilities of the Protestant &quot;good government&quot; advocates, suggesting that the Boston Public Garden be sold off and that the historic Shirley-Eustis House be razed for failing to meet modern codes.

During his first term, Curley moved his family into a luxurious mansion in Jamaica Plain, one plainly beyond the means of a typical civil servant&#x27;s salary. Begun in 1915, the twenty-plus room house was apparently built for little or no charge by contractors seeking favors from Curley. Curley&#x27;s finances were regularly investigated by the Boston Finance Commission, a body dominated by hostile Protestant Republicans, but he eluded legal charges‚Äîin part through Coakley&#x27;s intervention. Curley also effectively muzzled press investigations by threatening libel charges against offending media. In one notable incident, he also physically assaulted the publisher of the &quot;Boston Telegraph&quot; for publishing unflattering articles.

Curley&#x27;s attempt at reelection was foiled by Martin Lomasney, the boss of Boston&#x27;s West End. Lomasney, a longtime opposition figure to Curley in the city, orchestrated the entry of an Irish-American candidate into the 1917 mayoral race, who successfully siphoned enough votes away from Curley to hand victory to Republican Andrew J. Peters. In 1918, the state legislature dealt Curley a further blow by enacting legislation forbidding Boston mayors from holding consecutive terms.

==Second mayoralty (1922‚Äì1926)==
Pursuant to the new one-term restriction, Curley was elected mayor in 1921 but was not able to run for re-election in 1925.

In 1924, while serving as mayor, Curley ran for Governor of Massachusetts. He was defeated by Republican Lieutenant Governor Alvan T. Fuller.

== Third mayoralty (1930‚Äì1934) ==
In 1929, Curley won a third non-consecutive term as mayor.

In 1932, Governor Joseph B. Ely denied Curley a place in the Massachusetts delegation to the 1932 Democratic National Convention. Instead, Curley engineered his selection as a delegate from Puerto Rico under the alias of Alcalde (Spanish for &quot;Mayor&quot;) Jaime Curleo. Some say Curley&#x27;s support was instrumental in Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s nomination at the convention, but Curley broke with Roosevelt after the president refused to appoint him Ambassador to Ireland.

In 1933, Curley served as the president of the United States Conference of Mayors.

==Governorship (1935‚Äì1937)==

In 1934, amid a more favorable national and statewide environment for Democrats, Curley ran for Governor again. This time, he defeated Republican Lieutenant Governor Gaspar G. Bacon, an opponent of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, by more than 100,000.

Curley&#x27;s single term as governor was described by one commentator as &quot;ludicrous part of the time, shocking most of the time, and tawdry all of the time.&quot; It began with a shoving match with outgoing Governor Ely and descended into bare-knuckle politics. Curley expended significant political capital seeking to defang the Boston Finance Commission, which was closing in on the financial malfeasance of his mayoral administrations. Committee members were accused of failing to do their jobs and impeached, and investigators were fired. Curley was eventually able to install a more pliant commission and turned its attention to his political opponents. The negative press surrounding these actions ensured a loss of public popularity, as did his failure to significantly address widespread unemployment. His administration embarked on one major public works project, the Quabbin Reservoir, whose construction contracts were issued in signature Curley style.

In 1935, in a tweak at the state&#x27;s WASP elite, Curley appeared at Harvard&#x27;s commencement (a traditional ceremonial function of the Governor) wearing silk stockings, knee britches, a powdered wig, and a three-cornered hat with flowing plume. When University marshals objected, the story goes, Curley reportedly whipped out a copy of the Statutes of the Massachusetts Bay Colony which prescribed proper dress for the occasion and claimed that he was the only person at the ceremony properly dressed, thereby endearing him to many working and middle class Yankees.

Curley&#x27;s term as governor of Massachusetts has been characterized by one biographer as &quot;a disaster mitigated only by moments of farce&quot; for its free spending and corruption.

In 1936, instead of seeking reelection, Curley ran for the United States Senate. He lost the race to State Representative Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., a moderate Republican, despite a national landslide in favor of Democrats.

==Initial post-governorship==
After leaving the office of Governor, Curley squandered a substantial sum of his money in unsuccessful investments in Nevada gold mines; then he lost a civil suit brought by the Suffolk County prosecutor that forced him to forfeit to the city of Boston the $40,000 he received from General Equipment Company for &quot;fixing&quot; a damage claim settlement.

Curley was twice defeated, in November 1937 and November 1941, for the Boston mayoralty by one of his former political confidants, Maurice J. Tobin. Curley took his revenge against Tobin later, supporting Republican Robert F. Bradford for Governor against Tobin in 1946.

In 1938, he made another run for the governorship, defeating incumbent Democrat Governor Charles F. Hurley in a close primary, but losing the general election to Republican Leverett Saltonstall, the former speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives.

==Return to the U.S. Congress (1943‚Äì1947)==
In 1942, Curley managed to revive his faltering career by returning to Congress, challenging Democratic incumbent Thomas H. Eliot.

Eliot was a former New Deal attorney with an exemplary voting record on behalf of the Roosevelt administration, but was also the son of a Unitarian minister and grandson of Harvard president Charles William Eliot. Curley exploited Eliot&#x27;s background to appeal to working class anger against the Yankee upper class and, in a campaign speech which has entered Boston political lore, suggested Eliot had Communist leanings: &quot;There is more Americanism in one half of Jim Curley&#x27;s ass than in that pink body of Tom Eliot.&quot; Thus, despite his long-proven corruption and antagonism against the Yankee population, Curley managed to win them over in substantial numbers. He won the primarily easily and was re-elected in 1944.

==Fourth mayoralty (1946‚Äì1950)==
In 1945, Curley opted to vacate his seat in Congress to run for a fourth non-consecutive term as mayor of Boston. Curley appears to have been paid off by Joseph P. Kennedy (who supposedly agreed to pay off some of Curley&#x27;s debt and may have helped fund his 1949 run for reelection) to vacate the seat so that Kennedy&#x27;s son John could run for Congress in 1946 without significant Democratic opposition.

===Conviction and imprisonment===
By his fourth mayoral term, numerous investigations had been conducted against Curley&#x27;s machine during his time in Congress, and he now faced felony indictments for bribery brought by federal prosecutors. Nonetheless, Curley&#x27;s popularity with the Irish American community in Boston remained incredibly high in the face of his indictment. He campaigned on the slogan &quot;Curley Gets Things Done.&quot; A second indictment by a federal grand jury, for mail fraud, did not harm his campaign either, and Curley won the election with 45% of the vote.

In June 1947, Curley was accused of accepting $60,000 from the Engineers Group, a firm Curley headed which was under investigation for war profiteering. He was found guilty of mail fraud and sentenced to 6‚Äì18 months at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut. Under pressure from the Massachusetts congressional delegation and in consideration of Curley&#x27;s poor health, President Truman commuted his sentence after only five months. City Clerk John B. Hynes served as acting mayor during Curley&#x27;s time in prison.

===Return after prison sentence===
A crowd of thousands greeted Curley upon his return to Boston, with a brass band playing &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot;. In a fit of hubris after his first day back in office, Curley told reporters, &quot;I have accomplished more in one day than has been done in the five months of my absence.&quot;

In 1949, Curley was opposed for re-election by Hynes, who took Curley&#x27;s public comments as a personal affront and marshaled support to defeat him. While Curley argued Hynes lacked experience, Hynes responded that the city could not &quot;afford the city bosses anymore,&quot; and tapped into widespread dissatisfaction with the city&#x27;s high tax rate to defeat Curley in the primary. During his lame duck period, Curley granted a large number of tax abatements and granted exorbitant city contracts to cronies, further hampering the city&#x27;s finances.

Hynes was again victorious in a November 1951 rematch, ending Curley&#x27;s half-century career in elective politics.

==Retirement==
In retirement, Curley was financially supported by a state-granted pension ushered through the legislature by Tip O&#x27;Neill. Curley continued to support other candidates and remained active within the Democratic Party after his defeats. His death in Boston in 1958 was followed by one of the largest funerals in the city&#x27;s history.

==Personal life==
James had two brothers: John J. (1872‚Äì1944) and Michael (born 1879), who died at 2¬Ω.

Curley married Mary Emelda (n√©e Herlihy) (1884‚Äì1930). After her death, he remarried to Gertrude Casey Dennis, widowed mother of two boys, George and Richard.

Curley&#x27;s personal life was unusually tragic. He outlived his first wife and seven of his nine children.

Mary Emelda died in 1930 after a long battle with cancer. Twin sons John and Joseph died in infancy. Daughter Dorothea died of pneumonia as a teenager. His namesake James Jr., a Harvard Law student groomed as Curley&#x27;s political successor, died in 1931 at age 23 following an operation to remove a gallstone. His son Paul, who was an alcoholic, died during Curley&#x27;s 1945 mayoral run. His remaining daughter Mary died of a stroke in February 1950, and when her brother Leo was called to the scene, he became so distraught that he too suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died the same day at age 35.

Two remaining sons, George (1919‚Äì1970) and Francis X. (1923‚Äì1992), a Jesuit priest, outlived Curley.

==Legacy==

Historian James M. O&#x27;Toole has argued:
:Surely there has been no more flamboyant political personality than James Michael Curley, who dominated politics in Boston for half a century. Whether as incumbent or as candidate, he was always there: alderman, congressman, mayor, governor. People loved him or hated him, but they could not ignore him. He mastered the politics of ethnic and class warfare by defining a manichaean world of &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot;...He presided over state and city during the challenge of the Depression, leaving behind impressive monuments in stone and public works. In the end, he even managed to enter American political mythology, remembered as much in his fictional incarnations as for his real life.

Urban historian Kenneth T. Jackson has argued that:
:Curley was among the best-known and most colorful of the big-city, paternalistic bosses, Irish, Catholic, and Democratic ... Capitalizing on Irish-American resentment against the Republican, Harvard-educated Brahmans who dominated Boston&#x27;s social and economic life, Curley liked to think of himself as &quot;Mayor of the Poor&quot;...Curley helped immigrants to adjust to urban life by finding them jobs, easing their troubles with the law, building them playgrounds and public baths, and attending their weddings and wakes ... Because his feuds with fellow Irish chieftains like John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, Patrick Kennedy, and Martin Lomasney were legendary, he tried as mayor to centralize patronage and make the ward heeler obsolete. During the depression he used federal relief and work projects as a tool of his political ambitions. But Curley never built a really solid organization in Boston and never enjoyed the power or statewide influence of other well-known urban bosses.

The Curley House at 350 Jamaicaway, Jamaica Plain was designated a landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1989.

Curley is honored with two statues at Faneuil Hall. One shows him seated on a park bench. The other shows him standing, as if giving a speech, with a campaign button on his lapel. A few feet away was a bar named for one of his symbols, The Purple Shamrock.

Curley‚Äô strategy of driving opponents outside of the city, described by Harvard economists Andrei Shleifer and Edward Glaeser in &quot;The Curley Effect: The Economics of Shaping the Electorate,&quot; increased his political base by using distortionary economic policies, leading to long-term economic stagnation.

==In popular culture==
* Curley was the inspiration for the protagonist Frank Skeffington in the 1956 novel &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; by Edwin O&#x27;Connor and the John Ford film of the same name. Curley initially considered legal action but changed his mind upon meeting O&#x27;Connor. He told O&#x27;Connor he enjoyed the book, the passage he enjoyed most being &quot;the part where I die.&quot; He did successfully sue the film&#x27;s producers.
* Curley was the inspiration for the song &quot;The Rascal King&quot; on the album &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It&quot; by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones.
* The Curley family still holds Massachusetts auto registration number 5. It was, as of circa 1975, owned by his stepson Richard.
* In the final Southern Victory Series novel &quot;Settling Accounts: In at the Death&quot; by Harry Turtledove, Jim Curley was a candidate for Vice President of the United States.

<text>Deborah Shiu-lan Jin (; November 15, 1968 ‚Äì September 15, 2016) was an American physicist and fellow with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); Professor Adjunct, Department of Physics at the University of Colorado; and a fellow of the JILA, a NIST joint laboratory with the University of Colorado.

She was considered a pioneer in polar molecular quantum chemistry. From 1995 to 1997 she worked with Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman at JILA, where she was involved in some of the earliest studies of dilute gas Bose-Einstein condensates. In 2003, Dr. Jin&#x27;s team at JILA made the first fermionic condensate, a new form of matter. She used magnetic traps and lasers to cool fermionic atomic gases to less than 100 billionths of a degree above zero, successfully demonstrating quantum degeneracy and the formation of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate. Jin was frequently mentioned as a strong candidate for the Nobel Prize in Physics. In 2002, &quot;Discover&quot; magazine recognized her as one of the 50 most important women in science.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Jin was born in Santa Clara County, California, Jin was one of three children, and grew up in Indian Harbour Beach, Florida. Her father was a physicist and her mother a physicist working as an engineer. Her father Ron Jin was born in Fuzhou in 1933 and passed away in 2010.

=== Education ===
Jin graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University in 1990, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in physics after completing a senior thesis titled &quot;A Condensation-Pumped Dilution Refrigerator for Use in Cooling Millimeter Wave Bolometer Detectors&quot;. She was a recipient of the Allen G. Shenstone Prize in Physics in 1990.

Jin then studied at the University of Chicago, where she was a NSF Graduate Fellow from 1990 to 1993 and received a Ph.D. in physics in 1995, completing a doctoral thesis titled &quot;Experimental Study of the Phase Diagrams of Heavy Fermion Superconductors with Multiple Transitions&quot; under the supervision of Thomas Felix Rosenbaum.

=== Scientific contributions ===
After completing her Ph.D., Jin joined Eric Cornell&#x27;s group at JILA, the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics in Boulder, Colorado, as a postdoctoral researcher. This change from condensed matter to atomic physics required her to learn a new set of experimental techniques. Jin joined Cornell&#x27;s group soon after they achieved the first rubidium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), and performed experiments characterizing its properties.

In 1997, Jin formed her own group at JILA. Within two years, she developed the ability to create the first quantum degenerate gas of fermionic atoms. The work was motivated by earlier studies of BEC&#x27;s and the ability to cool a dilute gas of atoms to 1 ŒºK. The weak interactions between particles in a BEC led to interesting physics. It was theorized that fermionic atoms would form an analogous state at low enough temperatures, with fermions pairing up in a phenomenon similar to the creation of Cooper pairs in superconducting materials.

The work was complicated by the fact that, unlike bosons, fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state at the same time, due to the Pauli exclusion principle, and are therefore limited with regard to cooling mechanisms. At low enough temperature evaporative cooling, an important technique used to reach low enough temperature to create the first BEC&#x27;s, is no longer effective for fermions. To circumvent this issue, Jin and her team cooled potassium-40 atoms in two different magnetic sublevels. This enabled atoms in different sublevels to collide with each other, restoring the efficacy of evaporative cooling. Using this technique, Jin and her group were able to produce a degenerate Fermi gas at a temperature of about 300 nK, or half the Fermi temperature of the mixture.

In 2003, Jin and her team were the first to condense pairs of fermionic atoms. They directly observed a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate created solely by adjusting the interaction strength in an ultracold Fermi gas of atoms using a Feshbach resonance. She was able to observe transitions of the gas between a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state and Bose-Einstein condensate.

In 2008, Jin and her team developed a technique analogous to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) which allowed them to measure excitations of their degenerate gas with both energy- and momentum-resolution. They used this approach to study the nature of fermion pairing across the BCS-BEC crossover, the same system her group had first explored in 2003. These experiments provided the first experimental evidence of a pseudogap in the BCS-BEC crossover.

Jin continued to advance the frontiers of ultracold science when she and her colleague, Jun Ye, managed to cool polar molecules that possess a large electric dipole moment to ultracold temperatures, also in 2008. Rather than directly cool polar molecules, they created a gas of ultracold atoms and then transformed them into dipolar molecules in a coherent way. This work led to novel insights regarding the chemical reactions near absolute zero. They were able to observe and control potassium-rubidium (KRb) molecules in the lowest energy state (ground state). They were even able to observe molecules colliding and breaking and forming chemical bonds. Jin&#x27;s husband, John Bohn, who specialized in the theory of ultracold atomic collisions, collaborated with her on this work.

<text>Ernest Joseph King (23 November 1878 ‚Äì 25 June 1956) was a fleet admiral in the United States Navy who served as Commander in Chief, United States Fleet (COMINCH) and Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) during World War¬†II. Franklin Delano Roosevelt appointed King to command global American strategy during World War¬†II and he held supreme naval command in his unprecedented double capacity as COMINCH and CNO. He was the U.S. Navy&#x27;s second-most senior officer in World War II after Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy, who served as Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief. King commanded the United States Navy&#x27;s operations, planning, and administration and was a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Combined Chiefs of Staff.

King graduated fourth in the United States Naval Academy class of 1901. He received his first command in 1914, of the destroyer in the occupation of Veracruz. During World War¬†I, he served on the staff of Vice Admiral Henry T. Mayo, the commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet. After the war, King was the head of the Naval Postgraduate School and commanded submarine divisions. He directed the salvage of the submarine , earning the first of his three Navy Distinguished Service Medals, and later that of the . He qualified as a naval aviator in 1927, and was captain of the aircraft carrier . He then served as Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics. Following a period on the Navy&#x27;s General Board, he became commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet in February 1941.

Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, King was appointed as COMINCH, and in March 1942, he succeeded Admiral Harold R. Stark as CNO, holding these two positions under wartime Executive Order. He also established the &quot;numbered fleet&quot; organizations under his direct authority, to include his personal commands of the First Fleet in global offensive submarine efforts and conversely the Tenth Fleet for global antisubmarine efforts. Through his remarkable authorities as COMINCH and CNO, all subordinate commanders acted under King&#x27;s direct influence. King personally empowered the COMINCH Headquarters to execute global tactical operations, such as the campaign against the U-boats. He held paramount authority in representing the U.S. Navy during the top-level Allied World War II conferences. On the Combined Chiefs, King advocated means to attain speedy victory in Europe First in order to execute the final reconstruction strategy for global stabilization through the central Pacific War maritime offensive in Asia. Never preoccupied with land operations, King stood out as the paramount voice in advancing the naval view of global strategy.

==Early life and education==
Ernest Joseph King was born in Lorain, Ohio, on 23 November 1878, the second child of James Clydesdale King, a Scottish immigrant from Bridge of Weir, Renfrewshire, and his wife Elizabeth (Bessie) Keam, an immigrant from Plymouth, England. His father initially worked as a bridge builder, but moved to Lorain, where he worked in a railway repair shop. He had an older brother who died in infancy, two younger brothers and two younger sisters: Maude (who died aged seven), Mildred, Norman and Percy.

The family moved to Uhrichsville, Ohio, when his father took a position with the Pennsylvania Railroad workshops, but returned to Lorain a year later. When King was eleven years old, the family moved to Cleveland, where his father was a foreman at the Valley Railway workshops, and King was educated at the Fowler School. He decided to go to work rather than high school, and took a position with a company that made typesetting machines. When it closed he went to work for his father. After a year, the family returned to Lorain, and King entered Lorain High School. He graduated as valedictorian in the Class of 1897; his commencement speech was titled &quot;Uses of Adversity&quot;. The school was a small one; there were only thirteen classmates in his year.
King secured an appointment to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, from his local Congressman, Winfield Scott Kerr, after passing physical and written examinations in Mansfield, Ohio, ahead of thirty other applicants. He entered Annapolis as a naval cadet on 18 August 1897. He acquired the nickname &quot;Rey&quot;, the Spanish word for &quot;king&quot;.

During the summer breaks, naval cadets served on ships to accustom them to life at sea. While still at the Naval Academy, King served on the cruiser during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. During his senior year at the academy, he attained the rank of cadet lieutenant commander, the highest naval cadet ranking at that time. He graduated in June 1901, ranked fourth in his class of sixty-seven and he was elected to serve at the head of the brigade. In thinking about American maritime policy, King often recalled the influence of the graduation address as given by the Vice President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, who handed out the diplomas.&#x27;

==Surface ships==
===Far East cruise===
Graduates like King who went into the Navy had to serve for two years at sea before being commissioned as ensigns. King took a short course in torpedo design and operation at the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island. He then became the navigator of the survey ship , which conducted surveys of Cienfuegos Bay in Cuba. An eye injury resulted in his being sent to the Brooklyn Naval Hospital. When he recovered, he was ordered to report to the battleship , which was berthed in Brooklyn. The &quot;Illinois&quot; was the flagship of Rear Admiral Arent S. Crowninshield, and King got to know Crowninshield&#x27;s staff well. King hoped to find adventure, seeking orders to the cruiser , which was bound for the Asiatic Fleet.

King was promoted to ensign on 7 June 1903, having taken his examination while the &quot;Cincinnati&quot; was in Europe. The &quot;Cincinnati&quot; spent several weeks at anchor in Manila Bay, where it conducted target practice. In February 1904 it sailed to Korea, where the Russo-Japanese War had broken out. It remained in Korean waters until October, when it went to China. It was back in Manila for more target practice in February and March 1905 before returning to China. In June 1906, it escorted the Russian cruisers , and , survivors of the Battle of Tsushima, into Manila Bay, where they were interned.

As a junior officer, several captains applauded King&#x27;s technical ability and future potential. However, he upset many superiors by being cocky, perhaps overly confident, and certainly uninterested in fitting in with the prevailing wardroom culture of the era. In the Asiatic Fleet, King attained a reputation for being too willing to hang around in bars associated with enlisted sailors. His popular reputation for seeking the company of women originates with the tales told of King&#x27;s early career exploits with the Asiatic Fleet. Bouts of heavy drinking led to King being put under hatches, and a forthright and arrogant attitude bordering on insubordination led to adverse comments in his fitness reports. At one point, he ran afoul of the Executive Officer of &quot;Cincinnati&quot;, Commander Hugh Rodman, which resulted in King&#x27;s nomination for dismissal.

When King heard heard that members of the Annapolis class of 1902 were being sent home from the Asiatic Fleet, he sought and obtained an audience with Rear Admiral Charles J. Train. Train agreed that King was entitled to go home and arranged for him to travel on the former hospital ship , which departed on 27 June.

===Marriage and Annapolis===

On returning to the United States, King rejoined his fianc√©e, Martha Rankin (&quot;Mattie&quot;) Egerton, a Baltimore socialite he had met while at the Naval Academy. They had become engaged in January 1903. She was living at West Point, New York, with her sister Florence, who had married an Army officer, Walter D. Smith. King and Egerton were married in a ceremony in the West Point Cadet Chapel on 10 October 1905. They had six daughters, Claire, Elizabeth, Florence, Martha, Eleanor and Mildred; and a son, Ernest Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; King, Jr. Mattie stood out as the enabler for King&#x27;s rise within the ranks, as she presided within the social monoculture among what her friend, Anne Briscoe Pye, described in the manual, &quot;The Navy Wife.&quot;

King&#x27;s next assignment was as a gunnery officer on the battleship . King became a critic of shipboard organization, which was largely unchanged since the days of sail. He published his thoughts in &quot;Some Ideas About Organization on Board Ship&quot; in the &quot;United States Naval Institute Proceedings&quot;, which won a prize for best essay in 1909. &quot;The writer fully realizes the possible opposition,&quot; he wrote, &quot;for if there is anything more characteristic of the navy than its fighting ability, it is its inertia to change, or conservatism, or the clinging to things that are old because they are old.&quot; In addition to a gold medal, the prize came with $500 () and a lifetime membership of the United States Naval Institute.
Officers of King&#x27;s generation generally served three years at sea in the ranks of passed midshipman and ensign before attaining eligibility for promotion to lieutenant. The rank of lieutenant (junior grade) served as a temporal waypoint for officers requiring additional training or who failed to attain the requisite endorsements to receive the immediate promotion from ensign to the rank of lieutenant. King passed his exams and secured the requisite endorsement for promotion to lieutenant, although his missteps as a junior officer required the approval of the Navy Retention Board. For this reason, King left the Asiatic Fleet for temporary duty in Washington, D.C., for ten days of physical examinations and eventually his appearance before the Retention Board, as chaired by the President of the Naval War College, Rear Admiral Charles B. Stockton. Impressed with King&#x27;s potential, Stockton arranged the assignment of King to the staff of the Naval Academy with duty in the rank of full lieutenant.

At Annapolis, King taught ordnance, gunnery and seamanship. This posting reunited him with Mattie, who had been living with her family in Baltimore. After two years he became the officer in charge of discipline at Bancroft Hall. King returned to sea duty in 1909, as flag secretary to Rear Admiral Hugo Osterhaus. After a year, Osterhaus was transferred to shore duty, and King joined the engineering department of the battleship . He soon became the engineering officer. After a year on &quot;New Hampshire&quot;, Osterhaus returned to sea duty and King became his flag secretary once more. Fellow officers on the staff included Dudley Knox as fleet gunnery officer and Harry E. Yarnell as fleet engineering officer. King returned to shore duty at Annapolis in May 1912 as executive officer of the Naval Engineering Experiment Station. While there, he served as the secretary-treasurer of the Naval Institute, editing and publishing papers in the &quot;Proceedings&quot;. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 July 1913.

===World War I===

When war with Mexico threatened in 1913, King went to Washington, D.C., to lobby for command of a destroyer. He received his first command, the destroyer on 30 April 1914, participating in the United States occupation of Veracruz, escorting a mule transport from Galveston, Texas. He then moved on to his second command, a more modern destroyer, the on 18 July 1914. He also served as an aide-de-camp to the commander of the Atlantic Fleet destroyer flotilla, Captain William S. Sims.

In December 1915, King joined the staff of Vice Admiral Henry T. Mayo, the Commander in Chief, of the Atlantic Fleet. After the United States entered World War I, King went to the UK as part of Mayo&#x27;s staff. He was a frequent visitor to the Royal Navy and occasionally saw action as an observer on board British ships. He met Royal Navy officers of the Admiralty planning staff, including Rear Admiral Sir Roger Keyes and Captain Dudley Pound, sowing the seeds of future collaboration. Commodore The Marquess of Graham gave Mayo and King a tour of the aircraft carrier , providing a glimpse of the future of naval aviation. King was awarded the Navy Cross &quot;for distinguished service in the line of his profession as assistant chief of staff of the Atlantic Fleet.&quot; 

King was promoted to commander on 1 July 1917. When the chief of staff of the Atlantic Fleet, Captain Orton P. Jackson, was injured in a motor vehicle accident, King was fleeted up to replace him, with the rank of captain on 21 September 1918. Promotion to that rank at a young age earned King the sobriquet of &quot;Boy Captain&quot;. After the war King adopted his signature manner of wearing his uniform with a breast-pocket handkerchief below his ribbons. Officers serving alongside the Royal Navy did this in emulation of the British Admiral David Beatty, the commander of the British Grand Fleet. King was the last to continue this tradition.

After the war ended in November 1918, King became head of the Naval Postgraduate School in Annapolis. He bought a house there, where his family lived from then on. With Captains Dudley Knox and William S. Pye, King prepared a report on naval training that recommended changes to naval training and career paths, which gained wide circulation when he published it in the &quot;Proceedings&quot;. Most of the report&#x27;s recommendations were ignored within the Navy Department, although the ideas within the so-called &quot;K-P-K Report&quot; slowly influenced Bureau of Navigation policies for assigning officers for duty between sea duty and shore duty in the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1921, King heard that Rear Admiral Henry B. Wilson, an officer whose stance on naval education he disliked, was to become the Superintendent of the Naval Academy. King approached Captain William D. Leahy about an early return to sea duty. Leahy told him he was too junior for a seagoing captain&#x27;s command, and that nothing was available. After some discussion, King eventually accepted command of , a stores ship. Although auxiliaries like &quot;Bridge&quot; served a vital role, such a command was regarded as boring and was avoided by ambitious officers.

==Submarines==

After a year, King again approached Leahy about securing command of a destroyer division or flotilla and again was told that nothing was available. Leahy then suggested that if King was interested in submarines, he could offer him command of a submarine division. King accepted. King attended a short training course at the Submarine School in New London, Connecticut, before taking command of a submarine division, flying his commodore&#x27;s pennant from . He never earned his Submarine Warfare insignia (dolphins), although he proposed and designed the now-familiar dolphin insignia. On 4 September 1923, he took over command of the Naval Submarine Base at New London.

From September 1925 to July 1926, King directed the salvage of , earning the first of his three Navy Distinguished Service Medals. The task was a demanding one: &quot;S-51&quot; lay on the bottom with a large gash on the side in of water near Block Island, and navy salvage divers were not accustomed to working below . The submarine was raised by sealing compartments and forcing the water out of them with compressed air. Eight pontoon floats were added to make it buoyant again. Just as they were ready to raise it, a storm hit and the submarine suddenly rose to the surface. After an attempt to tow it failed, King made the difficult decision to sink it again. Eventually the divers succeeded in raising it and getting it to the New York Navy Yard.

==Aviation==
===Aviator training===
In 1925, Rear Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, asked King if he would consider a transfer to naval aviation. King was unable to accept the offer at that time due to the salvage of &quot;S-51&quot;, and he wanted command of a cruiser, which Leahy was unable to offer. King then accepted Moffett&#x27;s offer, although he still hoped for a cruiser. He assumed command of the aircraft tender , with additional duties as senior aide on the staff of Commander, Air Squadrons, Atlantic Fleet.
That year, the United States Congress passed a law (10 USC Sec. 5942) requiring commanders of all aircraft carriers, seaplane tenders, and aviation shore establishments be qualified naval aviators or naval aviation observers. King therefore reported to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, for aviator training in January 1927. He was the only captain in his class of twenty; although it also included Commander Richmond K. Turner, most of the class were ensigns or lieutenants. King received his wings as Naval Aviator No. 3368 on 26 May 1927 and resumed command of &quot;Wright&quot;.

Between 1926 and 1936 King flew an average of 150 hours annually. For a time, he frequently flew solo, flying to Annapolis for weekend visits with his family, but his solo flying was eliminated by a naval regulation prohibiting them for aviators aged 50 or over. King commanded &quot;Wright&quot; until 1929, except for a brief interlude overseeing the salvage of , for which he was awarded a gold star to his Distinguished Service Medal. He then became Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics under Moffett. The two quarreled over certain elements of Bureau policy, and King was replaced by Commander John Henry Towers and transferred to command of Naval Station Norfolk.

===Aircraft carrier captain===
On 20 June 1930, King became captain of the aircraft carrier ‚Äîthen one of the largest aircraft carriers in the world‚Äîwhich he commanded for the next two years. When not on duty, he enjoyed drinking, partying and socializing with his junior officers. He ignored complaints that some of his officers rented a secluded farmhouse where prohibition and blue laws were flouted. He enjoyed the company of women and had many affairs. Women avoided sitting next to him at dinner parties if they did not want to be groped under the table. King once told a friend: &quot;You ought to be very suspicious of anyone who won&#x27;t take a drink or doesn&#x27;t like women.&quot; 

Stories of and about the popular image of King often obscured the remarkable history underlying the pivotal events, which later shaped his command persona within the context of the U.S. Naval services in his era. Fidelity to the service also required fidelity within the context of the service monoculture. King&#x27;s wife and seven children usually accompanied to his various assignments ashore. King purchased several homes, along the way. By 1932, he purchased a home near the Naval War College in Rhode Island because the CNO, Admiral William V. Pratt advised King to expect orders to serve as President of the Naval War College. At that time, Pratt wished for King to assist experimentation and discussions of doctrine for submarines, aircraft carriers, and amphibious force development ongoing at the Naval War College.

Still too junior in lineal standing for an assured promotion to flag rank in 1932, King formally attended the Naval War College in the Senior Officer&#x27;s Course while awaiting the results of the impending flag promotion board. In one of his writings as submitted in November of 1932, &quot;The Influence of National Policy on Strategy&quot;, King g identified Great Britain and Japan as the United States&#x27;s most likely adversaries. He expounded on the theory that America&#x27;s weakness was representative democracy:
===Chief of the Bureau of Aviation===
When the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Rear Admiral William A. Moffett, died in the crash of the airship on 4 April 1933, King received immediate orders in the temporary rank of rear admiral as Chief of BuAer. King earned the support of Winder R. Harris, the managing editor of &quot;The Virginian-Pilot&quot; newspaper, and Senator Harry F. Byrd, who wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt to lobby for King&#x27;s permanent appointment. The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), Admiral William V. Pratt, listed King as his fourth choice for the appointment to BuAer, after Rear Admirals Joseph M. Reeves, Harry E. Yarnell and John Halligan Jr., hoping to install King at the Naval War College. However, Claude A. Swanson, the new Secretary of the Navy, recommended King, having been impressed by work in the salvage of the &quot;S-51&quot; and &quot;S-4&quot;, pressed the appointment for King to stand as Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, with the requisite Congressional approval pending for the permanent promotion to rear admiral on 26 April 1933.

As bureau chief, King worked closely with Leahy, who was now the chief of the Bureau of Navigation, to increase the number of naval aviators. Together they established the Aviation Cadet Training Program to recruit college graduates as aviators. His relationship with the CNO, Admiral William H. Standley, who sought to assert the power of the CNO over the bureau chiefs, was more tempestuous. With the help of Leahy and Swanson, King managed to block Standley&#x27;s proposals.

King appeared before a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, chaired by Congressman William A. Ayres, where he was questioned about the Bureau of Aeronautics&#x27;s contractual arrangements with Pratt and Whitney. Although warned by his staff that an forthright answer could strain the relationship with the sole supplier of certain engines the Navy needed, King confirmed to the committee that Pratt and Whitney was making profits of up to 45 percent. As a result, the 1934 Vinson‚ÄìTrammell Act contained a provision limiting profits on government aviation contracts to 10 percent.
===Commander, Aircraft, Battle Force===
In 1936, there were only two seagoing aviation flag billets: Commander, Aircraft, Battle Force, a vice admiral who commanded the Navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers, and Commander, Aircraft, Base Force, a rear admiral who commanded the seaplane squadrons. King hoped to get the former assignment, but this was opposed by Standley, and at the conclusion of his term as bureau chief in 1936, King became Commander, Aircraft, Base Force, at Naval Air Station North Island, California. He survived the crash of his Douglas XP3D transport on 8 February 1937.

Leahy succeeded Standley as CNO on 1 January 1937. King was promoted to vice admiral on 29 January 1938 on becoming Commander, Aircraft, Battle Force ‚Äì at the time one of only three vice admiral billets in the U.S. Navy. He flew his flag on the aircraft carrier . Among his accomplishments was to corroborate Yarnell&#x27;s 1932 war game findings in 1938 by staging his own successful simulated naval air raid on Pearl Harbor, showing that the base was dangerously vulnerable to aerial attack, although he was taken no more seriously until 7 December 1941, when the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the base.

==World War II==
===General Board===

King hoped to be appointed CNO or Commander in Chief, United States Fleet (CINCUS), but on 1 July 1939, he reverted to his permanent rank of rear admiral and was posted to the General Board, an elephants&#x27; graveyard where senior officers spent the time remaining before retirement. A series of extraordinary events would alter this outcome. In March, April and May 1940, King accompanied the Secretary of the Navy, Charles Edison, Edison&#x27;s naval aide, Captain Morton L. Deyo, and Edison&#x27;s friend Arthur Walsh on a six-week tour of naval bases in the Pacific. En route they stopped in Hollywood to preview &quot;Edison, the Man&quot;, a biographical film about the life of Edison&#x27;s father starring Spencer Tracy. &quot;I understand&quot;, Walsh told King, referring to a popular myth, &quot;that you shave with a blowtorch.&quot; King replied that this was an exaggeration. Walsh liked the story so much he told everyone he met, and eventually had Tiffany &amp; Co. make a scale model of a blowtorch, which he presented to King.

When they returned to Washington, D.C., Edison gave King a special assignment: to improve the anti-aircraft defenses of the fleet. Experiments with radio-controlled drones making passes at ships in February 1939 had shown that they were very difficult to shoot down. Aircraft were flying faster and carrying bigger bombs, posing a greater threat to the fleet, which would soon be confirmed in combat. King looked over the plans for each type of ship and made recommendations as to what kind of guns could be installed, where they should be located, and what should be removed to make way for them. He prepared a request for $300 million to carry out the program. Edison was impressed, and wrote to Roosevelt, recommending that King be appointed CINCUS, but Roosevelt did not make the appointment, influenced by King&#x27;s heavy drinking.
===Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet===

The CNO, Admiral Harold R. Stark, considered King&#x27;s talent for command was best employed in efforts to organize American strategy in conjunction with the British, once King reported to the general board. In September 1940, Stark summoned King to his office, along with the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, Rear Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, and offered King the command of the Atlantic Squadron. Nimitz explained that while King had been a vice admiral in his last seagoing command, he would only be a rear admiral for this one. King replied that he did not care, and accepted the position. However, his assumption of command was delayed for a month by a hernia operation, and then several more weeks while he accompanied Edison&#x27;s successor, Frank Knox, on another inspection tour, this time of bases in the Atlantic.

On 17 December 1940, King raised his flag as Commander, Patrol Force (as the Atlantic Squadron had been renamed on 1 November) on the battleship in Norfolk, Virginia. When he examined the war plan in the safe, he found it was for a war with Mexico. His first order, issued three days later, was to place the Patrol Force on a war footing. He astonished subordinates by stating that the United States was already at war with Germany. In January 1941 King issued , encouraging officers to delegate and avoid micromanagement, which is still cited widely in today&#x27;s armed forces. The Patrol Force was designated the Atlantic Fleet on 1 February 1941. King was promoted to admiral and became the Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANT).

In April 1941, King was summoned to Hyde Park, New York, where Roosevelt informed him of an upcoming conference with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, at Argentia. He went to Hyde Park again in July to make further arrangements. King found the old &quot;Texas&quot; to be unsuitable as a flagship, and on 24 April he switched to the cruiser once it had completed an overhaul. So it was that in August it was the &quot;Augusta&quot; that took Roosevelt to the Atlantic Conference, where King and British Admiral Sir Percy Noble worked out the details for the United States Navy escorting convoys halfway across the Atlantic.

Rather than risk a conflict with the United States on the eve of the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Germans withdrew their submarines from the western Atlantic. This emboldened Roosevelt to take further steps. He declared a National Emergency on 27 May. On 19 July, King issued orders creating Task Force 1, with the mission of escorting convoys to Iceland, which had been occupied by the U.S. Marines. Nominally, the convoys were American, but ships of any nationality were free to join. From 1 September, convoys were escorted to a mid-ocean meeting point, where they met escorts from the Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy. The United States was now engaged in an undeclared war, although they were still restricted by the Neutrality Acts of the 1930s. On 31 October, the destroyer became the first U.S. warship to be sunk by a German U-boat. In response to this and other incidents, Congress amended the Neutrality Acts in November, allowing merchant ships to be armed and to deliver goods to British ports.

===Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet===
====Staff====

With the United States declaration of war on Germany on 11 December, the Atlantic Fleet was officially at war. On 20 December, King became CINCUS. Ten days later he hoisted his flag on and was succeeded as CINCLANT by Admiral Royal E. Ingersoll. Nimitz became the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet on the same day. Legend has it that King said: &quot;When they get into trouble, they call for the sons-of-bitches.&quot; John L. McCrea, Roosevelt&#x27;s naval aide, asked King if he actually had said it. King replied that he had not, but would have if he had thought of it. The abbreviation CINCUS (pronounced &quot;sink-us&quot;) seemed inappropriate after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and on 12 March 1942, King officially changed it to COMINCH.

Stark was reluctant to part with Ingersoll as his chief of staff, but King insisted that he was needed as CINCLANT. He offered Rear Admiral Russell Willson, the Superintendent of the Naval Academy, and Rear Admiral Frederick J. Horne, from the General Board, as replacements. Stark chose Horne, and King then took Willson as his own chief of staff. Rear Admiral Richard S. Edwards, who had served King as Commander, Submarines, Atlantic Fleet, became his deputy chief of staff. For assistant chiefs of staff, King selected Rear Admirals Richmond K. Turner and Willis A. Lee.
King did not get along with Willson; their personalities were too different, and later admitted that he had made a mistake in appointing him. King had Willson retired in August 1942 due to heart conduction and replaced him with Edwards. When Turner went to the South Pacific for the Guadalcanal campaign, he was succeeded by Rear Admiral Charles M. Cooke Jr.. Although he was now based at the Navy Department in Washington, D.C., King wanted to be able to put to sea himself at any time. For his flagship, he selected the , a luxury yacht formerly owned by the family of Horace Dodge, which King renamed USS &quot;Dauntless&quot;. King lived on board &quot;Dauntless&quot;, which spent most of the war at anchor at the Washington Navy Yard.

Senator Harry S. Truman asked for an accounting of the cost of &quot;Dauntless&quot;. Congressman Harry R. Sheppard launched a formal investigation, and the cost of maintaining &quot;Dauntless&quot; in 1943 was assessed at $252,077 (). King informed Knox that he had confirmed this sum, and that there were opportunities to save $77.00. The Truman Committee was so informed. Roosevelt&#x27;s response was: &quot;if Saint George and his warhorse can keep our boys pitching dung and polishing his boots at Fort Myer then Ernie should get to keep his toys too.&quot;

====Joint Chiefs of Staff====
When the American chiefs of staff, which included King and Stark, met with the British Chiefs of Staff Committee at the Arcadia Conference in Washington, D.C., from 24 December 1941 to 14 January 1942, they agreed to merge their organizations to form the Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS), which held its first meeting in Washington, D.C., on 23 January 1942. To parallel the British chiefs, the Americans formed the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), which held its first meeting on 9 February 1942. The Joint Chiefs of Staff initially consisted of Stark, King, General George C. Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, and Lieutenant General Henry H. Arnold, the Chief of the United States Army Air Corps. In his role as a member of the CCS and JCS, King became engaged in the formulation of grand strategy, which came to occupy the majority of his time.
Roosevelt&#x27;s Executive Order 8984 made COMINCH the commander of the operational forces of the navy, and &quot;directly responsible, under the general direction of the Secretary of the Navy, to the President of the United States.&quot; There was considerable overlap between the roles of COMINCH and CNO, and on Stark&#x27;s advice, Roosevelt combined the duties of the two with Executive Order 9096. 

On 26 March, King succeeded Stark as CNO, becoming the only officer to hold this combined command. On the same date, Horne became the Vice Chief of Naval Operations. Although King was both COMINCH and CNO, the two offices remained separate and distinct. Stark became Commander, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe. Edwards, Cooke and Horne remained with King for the duration of the war, but more junior officers were brought in for periods of up to a year and then returned to sea duty.

Stark left the JCS in March 1942 when King succeeded him as CNO, reducing its membership to three until July 1942. Marshall advocated a joint general staff, but in the face of opposition from King, he backed down on the idea of an executive head of the services. Instead, Marshall pressed for a senior officer to act as a JCS spokesperson and a liaison between the JCS and the President. He nominated Leahy for the post, hoping that a naval officer would be more acceptable to King. King remained opposed, but Roosevelt was convinced of the merits of the proposal. On 21 July 1942, Leahy was appointed Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy and became the fourth member of the JCS. As the senior officer, Leahy chaired its meetings, but he did not exercise any command authority. King and Marshall retained their direct access to the President. King had thirty-two official meetings with Roosevelt at the White House in 1942, but only eight in 1943, nine in 1944 and just one in 1945.

When King turned 64 on 23 November 1942, King wrote Roosevelt to say he had reached mandatory retirement age. Roosevelt replied with a note saying: &quot;So what, old top? I may send you a birthday present.&quot; (The present was a framed photograph.) Although King remained the second most senior officer on the active list after Stark, he now served at Roosevelt&#x27;s pleasure, as he could be transferred to the retired list at any time. This remained the case until December 1944, when Leahy and then King were promoted to the newly-established five-star rank of fleet admiral.
====Civil-Naval relations====
Roosevelt was not above micromanaging the navy. For example, in early 1942 he sent explicit instructions to Admiral Thomas C. Hart, the commander of the Asiatic Fleet, detailing how he wanted surveillance patrols run. Roosevelt granted Marshall broad authority to reorganize the War Department, but King&#x27;s authority was more constrained. King, acting on a suggestion from Roosevelt that he &quot;streamline&quot; the Navy Department, ordered a restructure on 28 May. It was opposed by Knox and the Under Secretary of the Navy, James V. Forrestal, who saw it a challenge to their authority, and by the bureau chiefs, who feared a loss of their autonomy. Most importantly, it was opposed by Roosevelt, who, on 12 June, ordered Knox to cancel everything King had done. Roosevelt did assent to King&#x27;s proposal to create the post of Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Aviation (DCNO (Air)), but in a note to Knox in August 1943 he wrote: &quot;Tell Ernie once more: No reorganizing of the Navy Dept. set-up during the war. Let&#x27;s win it first.&quot;
With King reporting directly to Roosevelt and only under his &quot;general supervision&quot;, Knox saw King as a threat to his authority. He attempted to remove King in 1942 by suggesting he assume command in the Pacific as COMINCH, but this was not possible because as a member of the JCS, King had to remain in Washington, D.C. The following year, Knox tried to have Horne, who dealt with most of the CNO work like preparing budgets and appearing before Congress, appointed as CNO. This too failed, as it required executive action by Roosevelt, and King elevated Edwards over Horne&#x27;s head to the new position of deputy COMINCH and deputy CNO on 1 October 1944. Cooke replaced Edwards as chief of staff to the CNO.

Knox died from a heart attack on 28 April 1944, and Roosevelt nominated Forrestal as his replacement. As Under Secretary of the Navy, Forrestal was familiar with naval issues, and he had a good track record managing the navy&#x27;s procurement program. He was unanimously confirmed by the Senate, but King and Forrestal clashed.
====Ships and manpower====
The Navy had always thought in terms of ships, but more were on order than the Navy had personnel to crew them. The fleet grew faster than expected because plans assumed losses on the scale of 1942, but in fact they were much fewer. With the Navy now dominated by aviators and submariners, the easiest target for ship cancellations were the battleships. In May 1942, King had indefinitely deferred construction of five, including all the , in favor of more aircraft carriers and cruisers. King had opposed construction of the &quot;Montana&quot; class while he was on the General Board on the grounds that they were too big to fit through the Panama Canal.
Aircraft carriers were another matter; King strongly opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s proposal in August 1942 to defer the s on the grounds that they would consume too many resources and were unlikely to be completed until after the war. Eventually Roosevelt authorized them, but his forecast proved correct. However King gave way to Roosevelt on the issue of escort carriers; while he believed that nothing smaller than the would be useful in the Pacific war, he accepted Roosevelt&#x27;s argument that it was important to get new aircraft carriers in commission quickly. In 1943, with the war against the U-boats being won, King canceled 200 of the 1,000 destroyer escorts on order, but backed off canceling another 200 when the Bureau of Ships protested.

By March 1944, it was estimated that the Navy would reach its manpower ceiling by August, and would require 340,000 more sailors by the end of the year for ships under construction, which included nine s. On 2 July, King asked the Joint Chiefs to approve an increase of 390,000 men. The Army did not object, as it was more than 300,000 over its own personnel ceiling, and needed assault shipping for the Philippines campaign. It was noted that this would exacerbate the national labor shortage and adversely affect the munitions industry, and drastic measures might be required if the Army ran into more manpower difficulties, as indeed occurred.

===War in the Atlantic===

When war was declared on Germany, an attack on coastal shipping by U-boats was anticipated, as this was what had happened in World War I. On 12 December 1941, German U-boat commander, Karl D√∂nitz, ordered an attack, codenamed Operation (&quot;Roll of the drums&quot; or &quot;drumbeat&quot;). The following day, King issued a warning to all Atlantic commands of an impending German U-boat attack. This did not occur immediately, because the U-boats had been withdrawn from the Western Atlantic and priority was accorded to operations in the Mediterranean. Some use was made of this respite to lay a defensive naval minefield and erect protective harbor anti-submarine nets and booms. Only the long-range Type IX and some Type VII submarines could reach the Western Atlantic, so only six to eight U-boats were on station of the East coast between January and June 1942.
The carnage began on 12 January, when a British steamer was sunk off Cape Cod by . By the end of the month, U-boats had sunk thirteen ships totaling . Few of the merchant ships were armed and those that were, were no match for the U-boats. Each U-boat carried fourteen torpedoes, including some of the new electric model, which left no air bubbles in its wake, and had a deck gun capable of sinking many merchant ships. There was no seaboard blackout, as this was a politically sensitive issue‚Äîcoastal cities resisted, citing the loss of tourism revenue. Waterfront lights and signs switched off on 18 April 1942, and the Army declared a blackout of coastal cities on 18 May. The Germans had broken the American and British codes and sometimes lay in wait. Meanwhile, the German Navy added an extra wheel to its Enigma machines in April and the Allies lost the ability to decrypt its signals for ten months.
The first requirement of an effective anti-submarine campaign was anti-submarine escorts. In 1940, when he was a member of the General Board, King had recommended copying the Treasury-class cutter as an anti-submarine escort. As commander-in-chief of the Atlantic Fleet he had pressed Stark to secure such craft, but Stark replied that the President did not approve. Roosevelt, who had been involved in the development of the submarine chaser, a much smaller vessel, during World War I, believed that small craft would be sufficient to deal with the U-boats, and that they could be acquired at the last minute, so there was no need to interfere with the capital-ship building program. While acknowledging that small craft like submarine chasers had their uses, King pointed out that escort duty required vessels that could cope with rough weather and had sufficient crewmen to mount round-the-clock watches.

The ideal escort was the destroyer, but were required for escorting troopships and trans-Atlantic convoys, and protecting the warships of the Atlantic and Pacific fleets. They also had features not required for convoy escort duty that slowed their rate of production. A cut-down version of a destroyer, known as a destroyer escort, was developed specifically for anti-submarine warfare that could be produced in large numbers. The first of these was ordered in July 1941, and King asked for a thousand of them in June 1942, but higher priorities for landing craft resulted in the first of them not being delivered until April 1943.

As escorts became available, a system of coastal convoys could be instituted. King convened a board with representatives from COMINCH, CINCLANT, and the Sea Frontiers to devise a comprehensive system. &quot;Escort is not just one way of handling the submarine menace,&quot; King opined, &quot;it is the only way that gives any promise of success. The so-called hunting and patrol operations have time and again proved futile.&quot; The board reported on 27 March. In May 1942, King established a day and night interlocking convoy system running from Newport, Rhode Island, to Key West, Florida, and by August 1942, the submarine threat to shipping in US coastal waters had been contained. The same effect occurred when convoys were extended to the Caribbean.

As time went on, King gradually assumed more control over the anti-submarine campaign. He designated Edwards as anti-submarine coordinator, and in May 1942 he had the Convoy and Routing Section transferred from the office of the CNO to the office of the COMINCH. An anti-submarine warfare unit was established as part of the COMINCH staff. This led to the establishment of the Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group, which conducted operations research in cooperation with the scientists of the National Defense Research Committee. He also established, on the advice of Royal Navy officers, an operational intelligence center (OIC) that tracked U-boat movements and provided warning to merchant shipping. On 20 May 1943, he created the Tenth Fleet, under his own command, to coordinate the anti-submarine campaign. Between July 1942 and May 1943, German and Italian submarines sank 780 merchant ships totaling , but ships were being built faster than the submarines could sink them. In the same period, a monthly average of 13 submarines were sunk, compared to 18 to 23 being built each month.
Another answer to the U-Boat menace was long-range maritime patrol aircraft. This was complicated by inter-service squabbling over command and control. The aircraft belonged to the Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command, but the mission was the Navy&#x27;s, and there were differences in doctrine between the two. Arnold resisted assigning aircraft to operational control of the sea frontier commanders, and King rejected a proposal to place all air assets, Army and Navy, under the Army Air Forces. Instead, Marshall agreed to transfer the long-range B-24 Liberator aircraft to the Navy. Arnold and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson were apprehensive about this, and sought reassurances that the Navy was not seeking a role in strategic bombing. An acceptable agreement was negotiated, and the aircraft were transferred on 1 September 1943, except for some in the UK, which followed in November.

King accorded warship construction priority over merchant shipbuilding. The JCS approved of new Liberty ships for 1943 on condition that it did not interfere with warship construction. The merchant shipbuilding program only went ahead because industrial capacity rose to the point where this became possible. The JCS rejected further increases in merchant ships because steel was in short supply. There were also critical shortages of rubber, which the Army needed for truck tires and tank tracks, and high-octane aviation gasoline, which the Army Air Forces needed for its planes. King concurred with the War Production Board&#x27;s plans to give priority to synthetic rubber production, but rejected proposals to increase the priority of aviation gasoline production on the grounds that it would interfere with the destroyer escort program.

===War in Europe===
In keeping with the agreed &quot;Germany first&quot; strategy, the Joint Chiefs proposed to build up a force of 48 divisions in the UK (Operation Bolero) for a landing in France in 1943 (Operation Roundup). The U.S. Army planners realized that the Western Allies did not have the resources to challenge Germany on land and most of the fighting would have to be done by the Soviet Union. Keeping the Soviet Union in the war was therefore crucial. If the USSR looked like it was about to collapse, an emergency landing would be made in France in 1942 (Operation Sledgehammer).
The British chiefs rejected Sledgehammer and instead proposed an invasion of French North Africa (Operation Gymnast). The U.S. Army planners, led by Major General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Chief of the War Plans Division, concluded that the next best way to help the Soviets was an offensive against Japan in the Pacific, which would prevent the Japanese Kwantung Army in Manchuria from attacking the Soviet Union in Siberia. King concurred with this proposal; he did not see any value in leaving resources idle in the Atlantic when they could be utilized in the Pacific, especially when &quot;it was doubtful when‚Äîif ever‚Äîthe British would consent to a cross-Channel operation&quot;. Roosevelt did not agree, and he ordered the Joint Chiefs to carry out Operation Gymnast.

Landing ships and landing craft enjoyed the highest priority for construction in 1942, but after the abandonment of Sledgehammer and Roundup, King diverted many of them to the Pacific. At the First Quebec Conference in September 1943, King promised to provide 110 LST, 58 LCI, 146 LCT, 250 LCM and 470 LCVP for Operation Overlord, the invasion of France in 1944. When the Overlord plan was enlarged to five divisions in early 1944, this was not enough. There was also a discrepancy between British and American calculations of the capacity of the available landing ships and landing craft.
Marshall sent Major General John E. Hull and King sent Cooke to Europe, where they met with Rear Admirals Alan G. Kirk, the commander of the Western Naval Task Force (Task Force 122) and John L. Hall Jr., the commander of the XI Amphibious Force. Together they resolved the issues surrounding loading capacity and landing craft availability, and Eisenhower postponed Operation Anvil, the landing in Southern France, allowing more amphibious vessels to be released from the Mediterranean. Ultimately, King provided 168 LST, 124 LCI, 247 LCT, 216 LCM and 1,089 LCVP for Overlord. Hall took the opportunity to lobby for more naval gunfire support ships. King had assumed that the Royal Navy would provide this, but the Royal Navy was keeping a strong force in reserve with the Home Fleet in case the German Navy sortied. King sent the battleships , and and a squadron of destroyers.

===War in the Pacific===
King took the lead in developing a strategy for the war in the Pacific. Following Japan&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Midway in June 1942, King proposed an operation in the Solomon Islands. After some discussion of command arrangements, Marshall suggested moving the boundary of South West Pacific Area to transfer the southern Solomons to the South Pacific Area. The two theater commanders, General Douglas MacArthur and Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, expressed doubts about the operation, but King instructed Nimitz to proceed. The Marines successfully landed on Guadalcanal on 7 August, but on the night of 8/9 August the U.S. and Royal Australian Navy suffered a severe defeat in the Battle of Savo Island, losing four cruisers. King tried to suppress the news of the disaster.

As the situation in the South Pacific went from bad to worse, King attempted to get Marshall and Arnold to provide additional resources, but their priority was Operation Torch, the landing in North West Africa. In the end, Roosevelt ordered the Joint Chiefs to hold Guadalcanal. On 16 October, King assented to Nimitz&#x27;s request to relieve Ghormley, and replace him with Vice Admiral William F. Halsey. More aggressive leadership brought results, but at a cost: in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October, the aircraft carrier was damaged and the was sunk. The tide gradually turned in November as reinforcements arrived, although the fighting on Guadalcanal continued until 8 February 1943.
On behalf of the JCS, King took the lead in formulating strategy for the Pacific war. In March 1943, he called representatives from the South Pacific Area, Central Pacific Area and Southwest Pacific Area together for the Pacific Military Conference, which decided on the tasks for 1943. On 25 September 1943, King traveled to Pearl Harbor for his first meeting with Nimitz there. First item on the agenda was Operation Galvanic, the campaign to capture Tarawa Atoll and Nauru. Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, the commander of the Fifth Fleet, surprised King with a paper from the commander of the V Amphibious Corps, Major General Holland M. Smith, which argued that Nauru was too well-defended. Smith and Spruance recommended seizing Makin Atoll instead. King was reluctant to do so but eventually agreed, and secured the concurrence of the other Joint Chiefs.

King also met with Rear Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, the commander of the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s submarines. Lockwood told King about problems the submariners were having with the Mark 14 torpedo, which had both magnetic and contact exploders. Tests that he had recently conducted had confirmed reports from the submarine skippers that neither exploder worked properly, and he secured King&#x27;s permission to modify the torpedoes at Pearl Harbor rather than wait for the Bureau of Ordnance to provide fixes. King raised the prospect of promoting Lockwood to vice admiral. When Nimitz did not give Lockwood a spot promotion, King had Lockwood promoted when he returned to Washington, D.C. King had been impressed by the German G7e electric torpedoes, some of which had been salvaged after running ashore, and prompted the Bureau of Ordnance to develop an electric torpedo. The result was the Mark 18 torpedo, but it was beset by many developmental and production problems.

After the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, King then considered the capture of the Mariana Islands, Palau and Truk, with the ultimate objective being China, which was holding down the major part of the Japanese Army, and from whence King anticipated that the final assault on Japan would be launched. King pressed for the capture of the Mariana Islands, which could serve both as a naval base astride Japanese communications and as a base for aerial bombardment of the Japanese home islands by the Army&#x27;s long-range Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers. A major strategy issue in late 1944 was whether to follow the capture of the Marianas with an assault on Luzon or Formosa. King favored Formosa, but he was eventually convinced that Nimitz and MacArthur&#x27;s plan to take Luzon followed by Okinawa was preferable.

King emphasized the global strategic priorities for securing the sustainable peace in Europe while setting the sequence of priorities for eventual victory in Asia. He once complained that the Pacific deserved 30 percent of Allied resources but was getting only 15 percent. 
His advocacy for using Soviet and Chinese armies to defeat the Axis Tripartite also upset the politically charged debates within the Combined and Joint Chiefs of Staff. At the Cairo Conference in 1943, he was accused by British Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke of favoring the Pacific war, the argument became heated. The combative Lieutenant General Joseph Stilwell wrote: &quot;Brooke got nasty, and King got good and sore. King almost climbed over the table at Brooke. God, he was mad. I wished he had socked him.&quot; One of King&#x27;s daughters was quoted as saying of her father: &quot;he is the most even tempered person in the United States Navy. He is always in a rage.&quot;
King&#x27;s focus on China upset the deliberations concerning the sequence of priorities in the Pacific Campaign, which further frustrated Nimitz in relations with General Douglas MacArthur, among other Allied Commanders. King empowered temporary Rear Admiral Milton E. Miles to act as his personal authority in China, which upset transatlantic relationships at the highest levels of Allied command 

===Relations with the British===

The deployment of a British fleet to the Pacific was a political matter. The measure was forced on Churchill by the British Chiefs of Staff, not merely to re-establish British presence in the region, but to mitigate any impression in the US that the British were doing nothing to help defeat Japan. At the Octagon Conference in Quebec in September 1944, King was adamant that naval operations against Japan remain focused upon the final war aims of stabilization in Europe and Asia. He resisted efforts to intermix British and American naval forces, leading some historians portray King as suffering from Anglophobia. Such a characterization failed to reflect the historical understanding and deeper commitment King demonstrated as a strategist seeking to win as quickly and efficiently as possible in the global war at sea.

King cited the logistical and technical difficulties in maintaining British naval forces in the Pacific, details that he was intimately familiar with as a former aircraft carrier captain. The Royal Navy was designed for short-range operations in a cool climate; in the Pacific it would require its own ammunition and refrigerated cargo ships. Even American-supplied aircraft could not be used unmodified. Roosevelt and Leahy overruled him, and the Joint Chiefs accepted the British offer provided that the fleet would be fully self-supporting. Despite King&#x27;s reservations, the British Pacific Fleet acquitted itself well against Japan in the last months of the war. King&#x27;s concerns about logistics were valid, and the British Pacific Fleet was not fully self-supporting.

Like most Americans, King was opposed to operations that would assist the British, French and Dutch in reclaiming their pre-war overseas possessions in South East Asia. Although frequently described as Anglophobic, King was proud of his British ancestry, enjoyed his visits to the United Kingdom and established good relations with many of his British colleagues. When a Royal Air Force officer complained that King was anti-British, Field Marshal Sir John Dill said King was pro-American rather than anti-British. When Dill was in hospital, King visited him every day.

 When Admiral Sir James Somerville was placed in charge of the British naval delegation in Washington, D.C., in October 1944 he managed‚Äîto the surprise of almost everyone‚Äîto get on very well with the notoriously abrasive and anti-British King. General Hastings Ismay described King as:

==Retirement and death==
On 14 December 1944, Congress passed legislation creating the five-star ranks of fleet admiral and general of the army. Each service was authorized to have up to four officers of five-star rank. Leahy was promoted to fleet admiral on 15 December, and Marshall, King, MacArthur, Nimitz, Eisenhower and Arnold followed on successive days. When King was promoted on 17 December, he became the second of four men in the U.S. Navy to hold the rank of fleet admiral, and the third most senior officer in the U.S. military.

President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s Executive Order 9635 of 29 September 1945 revoked Executive Orders 8984 and 9096 and restored the primacy of the Secretary of the Navy and the CNO. The office of COMINCH was abolished on 10 October. It was King&#x27;s wish that Nimitz succeed him as CNO, but Forrestal wanted Edwards. King forced the issue by writing to Truman via Forrestal. Truman agreed to Nimitz&#x27;s appointment, Forrestal asserted his authority by limiting Nimitz&#x27;s tenure to two years instead of the usual four, and making the change of command earlier than King wanted.

Although King left active duty on 15 December, he officially remained in the Navy, as five-star officers were given active duty pay for life. The pay of all flag officers was the same until 1955, when Congress raised that of vice admirals and admirals, but that of five-star officers remained the same. Nor was it lifted during subsequent pay raises, and after they died the widows of five-star officers received a pension based on the rank of rear admiral.
In retirement, King lived in Washington, D.C. He was active in his early post-retirement, serving as president of the Naval Historical Foundation from 1946 to 1949, and he wrote the foreword to and assisted in the writing of &quot;Battle Stations! Your Navy In Action&quot;, a photographic history book depicting the U.S. Navy&#x27;s operations in World War II that was published in 1946. With Walter Muir Whitehill, he co-wrote an autobiography (in the third person), &quot;Fleet Admiral King: A Naval Record&quot;, which was published in 1952.

King suffered a debilitating stroke in August 1947, and subsequent ill-health ultimately forced him to stay in naval hospitals at Bethesda, Maryland, and at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. King died of a heart attack in Kittery on 25 June 1956, at the age of 77. His body was flown to Washington, D.C., and after lying in state at the National Cathedral, King was buried in the United States Naval Academy Cemetery at Annapolis, Maryland. His wife Mattie was buried beside him in 1969. His papers are in the Nimitz Library at the United States Naval Academy.

==Dates of rank==
* United States Naval Academy naval cadet ‚Äì June 1901

King never held the rank of lieutenant (junior grade) although, for administrative reasons, his service record annotates his promotion to both lieutenant (junior grade) and lieutenant on the same day.

=== Navy Distinguished Service Medal citation (third award) ===

The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Second Gold Star in lieu of a Third Award of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal to Fleet Admiral Ernest Joseph King, United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service in a position of great responsibility to the Government of the United States as Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet from 20 December 1941, and concurrently as Chief of Naval Operations from 18 March 1942 to 10 October 1945. During the above periods, Fleet Admiral King, in his dual capacity, exercised complete military control of the naval forces of the United States Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard and directed all activities of these forces in conjunction with the U.S. Army and our Allies to bring victory to the United States. As the United States Naval Member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combined Chiefs of Staff, he coordinated the naval strength of this country with all agencies of the United States and of the Allied Nations, and with exceptional vision, driving energy, and uncompromising devotion to duty, he fulfilled his tremendous responsibility of command and direction of the greatest naval force the world has ever seen and the simultaneous expansion of all naval facilities in the prosecution of the war. With extraordinary foresight, sound judgment, and brilliant strategic genius, he exercised a guiding influence in the Allied strategy of victory. Analyzing with astute military acumen the multiple complexity of large-scale combined operations and the paramount importance of amphibious warfare, Fleet Admiral King exercised a guiding influence in the formation of all operational and logistic plans and achieved complete coordination between the U.S. Navy and all Allied military and naval forces. His outstanding qualities of leadership throughout the greatest period of crisis in the history of our country were an inspiration to the forces under his command and to all associated with him.

<text>The Gloria Patri, also known in English as the Glory Be to the Father or, colloquially, the Glory Be, is a doxology, a short hymn of praise to God in various Christian liturgies. It is also referred to as the Minor Doxology &quot;(Doxologia Minor)&quot; or Lesser Doxology, to distinguish it from the Greater Doxology, the Gloria in Excelsis Deo.

The earliest Christian doxologies are addressed to the Father &quot;through&quot; (Œ¥Œπ·Ω∞) the Son, or to the Father and the Holy Spirit with (ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨) the Son, or to the Son with (œÉœçŒΩ) the Father and the Holy Spirit.

The Trinitarian doxology addressed in parallel fashion to all three Divine Persons of the Trinity, joined by &quot;and&quot; (Œ∫Œ±ŒØ), as in the form of baptism, Matthew 28:19, became universal in Nicaean Christianity, which was established as the official faith of the Roman Empire with the Edict of Thessalonica in 380.

==Greek version==
The Greek wording is as follows:
:
:

:Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, 
:Both now and always, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.

The second part is occasionally slightly modified and other verses are sometimes introduced between the two halves.

==Syriac version==
:Modern Sureth (used by the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church)
::

:East Classical Syriac (used by the Assyrian Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, the Syro Malabar Church, and other churches of the East Syriac traditions)
::

:West Syriac (used by the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Syriac Catholic Church and the Maronite Church)
::

:Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit,
:from everlasting and for ever and ever (literal translation)

According to &quot;Worship Music: A Concise Dictionary&quot;, the lesser doxology is of Syrian origin.

There is an alternate version which the Syriac Orthodox Church and Syriac Catholic Church use in their liturgies:
::

:Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit,
:And upon us, weak and sinful, may mercy and compassion be showered, in both worlds, forever and ever. Amen.

==Arabic==
Arabic is one of the official liturgical languages of the Church of Jerusalem and the Church of Antioch, both autocephalous Orthodox Churches and two of the four ancient Patriarchates of the Pentarchy.

The Arabic wording of this doxology is as follows:
 

==Roman Rite Latin version==
:

:Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,
:As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

This differs from the Greek version because of the insertion of &quot;sicut erat in principio&quot;, which is now taken to mean &quot;as it (glory) was in the beginning&quot;, but which seems originally to have meant &quot;as he (the Son) was in the beginning&quot;, and echo of the opening words of the Gospel according to John: &quot;In the beginning was the Word&quot;.

In 529, the Second Synod of Vasio (Vaison-la-Romaine) in Gaul said in its fifth canon that the second part of the doxology, with the words &quot;sicut erat in principio&quot;, was used in Rome, the East, and Africa, and ordered that it be said likewise in Gaul. Writing in the 1909 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, Adrian Fortescue, while remarking that what the synod said of the East was false, took the synod&#x27;s decree to mean that the form originally used in the West was the same as the Greek form. From about the 7th century, the present Roman Rite version became almost universal throughout the West.

==Mozarabic Rite Latin version==
::Gloria et honor Patri et Filio et Spiritui sancto
::in s√¶cula s√¶culorum.

::Glory and honour to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit
::for ages of ages.

The similarity between this version used in the then extreme west of the Church and the Syriac version used in the extreme east is noteworthy.

==English versions==
The following traditional form is the most common in Anglican usage and in older Lutheran liturgical books:
:Glory be to the Father, and to the Son:
:and to the Holy Ghost;
:As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be:
:world without end. Amen.

The translations of &quot;semper&quot; as &quot;ever shall be&quot;, and &quot;in saecula saeculorum&quot; as &quot;world without end&quot; date at least from Thomas Cranmer&#x27;s &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;.

The Catholic Church uses the same English form, but today replaces &quot;Holy Ghost&quot; with &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;, as in &quot;The Divine Office&quot; the edition of the Liturgy of the Hours used in most English-speaking countries outside the United States. &quot;Divine Worship: The Missal&quot;, published by the Holy See in 2015 for use under the Apostolic Constitution &quot;Anglicanorum Coetibus&quot; allows &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; and &quot;Holy Ghost&quot; to be used interchangeably.

In 1971, the International Consultation on English Texts (ICET) used since 1971:
:Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:
:as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.

This was adopted in the publication, &quot;Liturgy of the Hours&quot; (Catholic Book Publishing Company), but has not come into popular use by lay Catholics . It is found also in some Anglican and Lutheran publications.

A variant found in &quot;Common Worship&quot; has &quot;shall&quot; instead of &quot;will&quot;:
:Glory to the Father and to the Son
:and to the Holy Spirit;
:as it was in the beginning is now
:and shall be for ever. Amen.

(In the third person, &quot;shall&quot;‚Äîas opposed to &quot;will&quot;‚Äîimplies a degree of promise on the part of the speaker over and above mere futurity.)

Especially in Anglican circles, there are various alternative forms of the Gloria Patri designed to avoid masculine language. The form included in &quot;Celebrating Common Prayer&quot; is:
:Glory to God, Source of all being,
:Eternal Word and Holy Spirit;
:as it was in the beginning is now
:and shall be for ever. Amen.

The doxology in use by the English-speaking Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches follows the Greek form, of which one English translation is:
:Glory to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,
:now and forever and to the ages of ages. Amen.

The translation of the Greek form used by the Melkite Greek Catholic Church in the United States is:
:Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,
:now and always and forever and ever. Amen.

==Use==
===Eastern Churches===
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Church of the East, and the Eastern Catholic Churches, the Lesser Doxology is frequently used at diverse points in services and private prayers. Among other instances, it is said three times by the reader during the usual beginning of every service, and as part of the dismissal at the end. When it is used in a series of hymns it is chanted either before the last hymn or before the penultimate hymn. In the latter case, it is divided in half, the &quot;Glory...&quot; being chanted before the penultimate hymn, and &quot;Both now...&quot; being chanted before the final hymn (which is usually a Theotokion).

===Western Churches===
In the Roman Rite, the &quot;Gloria Patri&quot; is frequently chanted or recited in the Liturgy of the Hours principally at the end of psalms and canticles and in the responsories. There are a few exceptions: for the canticle in the Book of Daniel, Chapter 3 (The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children), the &quot;Gloria Patri&quot; is not chanted; rubrics in the liturgical books direct that: &quot;In fine huius cantici non dicitur Gloria Patri&quot; (&quot;at the end of this canticle the &quot;Gloria Patri&quot; is not to be said&quot;). Instead, the phrase &quot;Praise him, and magnify him forever&quot; is used.

The &quot;Gloria Patri&quot; also figures in the Introit of the Latin Mass. It is also present in the Introit in the form of the Roman Rite published in &quot;Divine Worship: The Missal&quot;. The prayer also figures prominently in pious devotions, notably the Rosary, where it is recited at the end of each decade. Among Anglicans, the &quot;Gloria Patri&quot; is mainly used at the Daily Offices of Morning and Evening Prayer, to introduce and conclude the singing or recitation of psalms, and to conclude the canticles that lack their own concluding doxologies.

Lutherans have historically added the &quot;Gloria Patri&quot; both after the chanting of the Responsorial Psalm and following the &quot;Nunc Dimittis&quot; during their Divine Service, as well as during Matins and Vespers in the Canonical hours. In Methodism, the &quot;Gloria Patri&quot; (usually in the traditional English form above) is frequently sung to conclude the &quot;responsive reading&quot; of the psalms as they are set out for congregational reading.

===Indulgence===
On 11 July 1815, Pope Pius VII established an indulgence of 100 days for every prayer of the
&quot;Gloria Patri&quot;, obtainable up to a maximum of three times a day.

<doc id="447642" wikidata="Q4352885" url="?curid=447642" title="HMS Manchester (D95)">
<text>HMS &quot;Manchester&quot; was a Type 42 (Batch 3) destroyer in the 5th Destroyer Squadron of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy. She was laid down in 1978 at Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering, launched in 1980, commissioned in 1982, and decommissioned on 24 February 2011.

Her nickname was the &quot;Busy Bee&quot;, in reference to the Manchester bee symbol and the bee emblem is also depicted on the ship&#x27;s crest.

==Construction and design==
&quot;Manchester&quot; was laid down on 19 May 1978, was launched on 24 November 1980 and commissioned on 16 December 1982.

&quot;Manchester&quot; was the first of the four Batch 3 Type 42 destroyers. In order to give better seakeeping and ease the cramped conditions on board, the ship&#x27;s hull was lengthened by compared to the earlier Batch 1 and 2 ships, giving a length at the waterline of and an overall length of . Beam was also increased by to , while draught was at the ship&#x27;s keel and to the ship&#x27;s propellers. Displacement was full load. The ship was powered by two Rolls-Royce Olympus TM3B gas turbines rated at each and two Rolls-Royce Tyne RM1C gas turbines of in a COGOG arrangement, with a maximum speed of when powered by the Olympus engines and a cruise speed of powered by the Tynes. Range was at .

==Service history==
===Early operations===
HMS &quot;Manchester&quot; commissioned in 1983 with 50% of her Ship&#x27;s Company taken from and &#x27;s survivors. &quot;Manchester&quot;‚Ä≥s first operational deployment was to the Falkland Islands in 1983/84. During the mid-1980s &quot;Manchester&quot; participated in the Royal Navy&#x27;s Global 86 tour where a task group, led by &quot;Illustrious,&quot; was detached to fly the flag in a round the world cruise and series of port visits.

The ship joined the 5th Destroyer Squadron.

In 1988, she saw service on Operation Armilla, in company with the frigates (Returned to UK early with mechanical problems) and . It was whilst on this deployment that the ship was visited by the then UK Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who made a flying visit following her tour of India. The period also coincided with the end of the Iran-Iraq war and shooting down of the Iran Air Flight 655 by the Aegis missile cruiser on the morning of 4 July 1988.

===Gulf War===
In 1991, during the First Gulf War, she participated in numerous operations in the Persian Gulf, aimed at primarily upholding the trade blockade imposed on Iraq during Saddam Hussein&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait. She won the lineage its newest battle honour - Persian Gulf 1991.

===Post-Gulf War===
In February 2000, &quot;Manchester&quot; was deployed on Atlantic Patrol Tasking (North) to the Caribbean carrying out counter narcotics operations in concert with RFA Grey Rover and USS Deyo and the US LEDET. Port visits included Key West, Barbados, St Vincent, Trinidad, Cura√ßao, Cartagena, Martinique and New York on her return. Whilst in New York, she was one of several ships hit by the liner Queen Elizabeth 2 whilst berthed alongside the East River.

&quot;Manchester&quot; returned to the West Indies for second 4-month spell in 2003.

In 2004, &quot;Manchester&quot; acted in the role of Fleet Ready Escort (FRE). In September &quot;Manchester&quot; sailed from Portsmouth to take part in Exercise Destiny Glory O4, a large NATO exercise in the Mediterranean, as part of an RN naval task force consisting of , and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary . During the deployment &quot;Manchester&quot; visited a number of ports in the Mediterranean.

In the autumn of 2005, &quot;Manchester&quot; was deployed in the Mediterranean as part of a NATO task force. During the four-month deployment she was employed in a counter terrorist role alongside other European and American ships.

From 27 to 30 July 2009, &quot;Manchester&quot; travelled to Bermuda to help celebrate the British Overseas Territory&#x27;s 400th anniversary. The crew took part in a historical re-enactment of the wrecking of the sailing ship on 28 July 1609, which was en route as a rescue supply ship to British colonialists in Virginia at the time.

During this tour, she also visited the Falkland Islands, Brazil and Colombia and spent time in Cape Verde for counter-narcotics training with the local coastguard. However upon her return to Britain a junior rating was alleged to have attempted to smuggle 12 kilograms of cocaine in bags in her personal quarters.

In 2010 &quot;Manchester&quot; was on a seven-month deployment to the Caribbean, mainly on counter-drug operations and a display of security to Britain&#x27;s Overseas Territories in the region. On 15 November 2010, &quot;Manchester&quot; became the first British warship to visit Havana, Cuba, since in 1957. Her officers discussed co-operation with the Cuban Navy on counter-drug-trafficking and disaster relief operations in the region. Manchester&#x27;s visit to Cuba supposedly paved the way for the thawing of US-Cuba relations. This deployment ended in December 2010 and culminated in a ¬£19 million drug bust. Her Caribbean deployment was also the subject of a Channel 5 documentary series entitled &quot;Royal Navy Caribbean Patrol&quot; broadcast from 7 February 2011 onwards.

On 2 February 2011, &quot;Manchester&quot; berthed at Liverpool, England, as the city was the nearest to Manchester, the city of her affiliation. The crew hosted a civic reception onboard before parading through the city for their final freedom of the city parade.

==Fate==

On 21 February 2011, &quot;Manchester&quot; sailed into her home port of HMNB Portsmouth where she was decommissioned on 24 February 2011.

<text>Robert Duncan McNeill (born November 9, 1964) is an American director, producer, and actor. As an actor, he is best known for his role as Lieutenant Tom Paris on the television series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. He has also served as an executive producer and frequent director of the television series &quot;Chuck&quot;, &quot;Resident Alien&quot;, &quot;The Gifted&quot;, and &quot;Turner &amp; Hooch&quot;.

==Personal life==
McNeill and his first wife, Carol, had three children together before their 2015 divorce. In 2005, McNeill directed his then teenaged daughter, Taylor, when she had a small role in the episode &quot;The Pleiades&quot; of the series &quot;Summerland&quot;. His son Kyle is a singer songwriter. McNeill married Rebecca Jayne Sims in Vancouver, Canada, on March 7, 2021.

==Career==
===Acting===
McNeill grew up in Atlanta, and began his career acting in local and regional productions before becoming a student at Juilliard School in New York City. He enjoyed early success as a professional actor, winning the role of Charlie Brent on &quot;All My Children&quot; and starring in the feature film &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;. He starred in an episode of the 1980s version of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;A Message From Charity&quot;. 

He appeared with Stockard Channing in the Broadway production of &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; before returning to Los Angeles to pursue roles on television. He appeared in the music video for &quot;Material Girl&quot; as one of several tuxedoed gentlemen dancing with Madonna. He also featured in guest roles on numerous TV series, including &quot;L.A. Law&quot;; &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;; and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. He was a featured cast member on the short-lived 1992 series &quot;Going to Extremes&quot;, Another guest role that same year was in &quot;The First Duty&quot;, an episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, in which he played Nick Locarno, a Starfleet Academy cadet and squad leader who pressures fellow cadets, including Wesley Crusher, into covering up their wrongdoings. He would later become a &quot;Trek&quot; regular in 1995 on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, on which he played Tom Paris, a Starfleet officer with a backstory similar to Locarno&#x27;s. In 2023, he reprised the role of Nick Locarno in &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; season 4.

Other credits include Zebulon in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; at the Paper Mill Playhouse and Judas in &quot;Godspell&quot; at the Lamb&#x27;s Theatre.

===Directing===

McNeill began his directing career with several episodes of &quot;Voyager&quot;. He then wrote, produced, and directed two award-winning short films, &quot;The Battery&quot; and &quot;9mm of Love&quot;, and began to direct other episodic television shows. While he has since performed as a guest star on television shows such as &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; and &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;, McNeill is now focusing on his directing career, helming episodes of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Everwood&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;, &quot;The O.C.&quot;, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;Summerland&quot;, and &quot;Supernatural&quot;. His directing credits for 2006‚Äì2007 include episodes of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;Standoff&quot;, &quot;The Nine&quot;, &quot;The Knights of Prosperity&quot;, &quot;In Case of Emergency&quot;, &quot;What About Brian&quot;, and &quot;My Boys&quot;. In 2007, he directed the season¬†5 premiere of &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, the pilot of &quot;Samantha Who?&quot; (which features his &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; costar Tim Russ) and then signed on as a producer-director of the NBC show &quot;Chuck,&quot; helming numerous episodes, including the first episode of a television show to be broadcast entirely in 3D. In 2010, McNeill directed an episode of &quot;V&quot;. As of 2019 he has directed two episodes of the Fox series &quot;The Orville&quot; and &quot;The Gifted&quot;. In 2021, McNeill directed several episodes of the Disney+ series &quot;Turner &amp; Hooch&quot;.

===Podcast===
In May 2020, McNeill and Voyager co-star Garrett Wang started the podcast &quot;The Delta Flyers&quot; where they discuss episodes of Voyager. It has been successful enough that the show has progressed to episodes of Deep Space 9, with Armin Shimerman and Terry Farrell as regular hosts

<doc id="447645" wikidata="Q4724000" url="?curid=447645" title="Algebraic function field">
<text>In mathematics, an algebraic function field (often abbreviated as function field) of &quot;n&quot; variables over a field &quot;k&quot; is a finitely generated field extension &quot;K&quot;/&quot;k&quot; which has transcendence degree &quot;n&quot; over &quot;k&quot;. Equivalently, an algebraic function field of &quot;n&quot; variables over &quot;k&quot; may be defined as a finite field extension of the field &quot;K&quot; = &quot;k&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) of rational functions in &quot;n&quot; variables over &quot;k&quot;.

==Example==
As an example, in the polynomial ring &quot;k&quot;[&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;] consider the ideal generated by the irreducible polynomial &quot;Y&quot;2‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ&quot;X&quot;3 and form the field of fractions of the quotient ring &quot;k&quot;[&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;]/(&quot;Y&quot;2‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ&quot;X&quot;3). This is a function field of one variable over &quot;k&quot;; it can also be written as formula_1 (with degree 2 over formula_2) or as formula_3 (with degree 3 over formula_4). We see that the degree of an algebraic function field is not a well-defined notion.

==Category structure==
The algebraic function fields over &quot;k&quot; form a category; the morphisms from function field &quot;K&quot; to &quot;L&quot; are the ring homomorphisms &quot;f&quot;¬†:¬†&quot;K&quot; ‚Üí &quot;L&quot; with &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = &quot;a&quot; for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;k&quot;. All these morphisms are injective. If &quot;K&quot; is a function field over &quot;k&quot; of &quot;n&quot; variables, and &quot;L&quot; is a function field in &quot;m&quot; variables, and &quot;n&quot; &gt; &quot;m&quot;, then there are no morphisms from &quot;K&quot; to &quot;L&quot;.

==Function fields arising from varieties, curves and Riemann surfaces==
The function field of an algebraic variety of dimension &quot;n&quot; over &quot;k&quot; is an algebraic function field of &quot;n&quot; variables over &quot;k&quot;.
Two varieties are birationally equivalent if and only if their function fields are isomorphic. (But note that non-isomorphic varieties may have the same function field!) Assigning to each variety its function field yields a duality (contravariant equivalence) between the category of varieties over &quot;k&quot; (with dominant rational maps as morphisms) and the category of algebraic function fields over &quot;k&quot;. (The varieties considered here are to be taken in the scheme sense; they need not have any &quot;k&quot;-rational points, like the curve defined over the reals, that is with .)

The case &quot;n&quot;‚Äâ=‚Äâ1 (irreducible algebraic curves in the scheme sense) is especially important, since every function field of one variable over &quot;k&quot; arises as the function field of a uniquely defined regular (i.e. non-singular) projective irreducible algebraic curve over &quot;k&quot;. In fact, the function field yields a duality between the category of regular projective irreducible algebraic curves (with dominant regular maps as morphisms) and the category of function fields of one variable over &quot;k&quot;.

The field M(&quot;X&quot;) of meromorphic functions defined on a connected Riemann surface &quot;X&quot; is a function field of one variable over the complex numbers C. In fact, M yields a duality (contravariant equivalence) between the category of compact connected Riemann surfaces (with non-constant holomorphic maps as morphisms) and function fields of one variable over C. A similar correspondence exists between compact connected Klein surfaces and function fields in one variable over R.

==Number fields and finite fields==
The function field analogy states that almost all theorems on number fields have a counterpart on function fields of one variable over a finite field, and these counterparts are frequently easier to prove. (For example, see Analogue for irreducible polynomials over a finite field.) In the context of this analogy, both number fields and function fields over finite fields are usually called &quot;global fields&quot;.

The study of function fields over a finite field has applications in cryptography and error correcting codes. For example, the function field of an elliptic curve over a finite field (an important mathematical tool for public key cryptography) is an algebraic function field.

Function fields over the field of rational numbers play also an important role in solving inverse Galois problems.

==Field of constants==
Given any algebraic function field &quot;K&quot; over &quot;k&quot;, we can consider the set of elements of &quot;K&quot; which are algebraic over &quot;k&quot;. These elements form a field, known as the &quot;field of constants&quot; of the algebraic function field.

For instance, C(&quot;x&quot;) is a function field of one variable over R; its field of constants is C.

==Valuations and places==
Key tools to study algebraic function fields are absolute values, valuations, places and their completions.

Given an algebraic function field &quot;K&quot;/&quot;k&quot; of one variable, we define the notion of a &quot;valuation ring&quot; of &quot;K&quot;/&quot;k&quot;: this is a subring &quot;O&quot; of &quot;K&quot; that contains &quot;k&quot; and is different from &quot;k&quot; and &quot;K&quot;, and such that for any &quot;x&quot; in &quot;K&quot; we have &quot;x&quot;‚Äâ‚àà‚Äâ&quot;O&quot; or &quot;x&quot;¬†-1‚Äâ‚àà‚Äâ&quot;O&quot;. Each such valuation ring is a discrete valuation ring and its maximal ideal is called a &quot;place&quot; of &quot;K&quot;/&quot;k&quot;.

A &quot;discrete valuation&quot; of &quot;K&quot;/&quot;k&quot; is a surjective function &quot;v&quot; : &quot;K&quot; ‚Üí Z‚à™{‚àû} such that &quot;v&quot;(x)‚Äâ=‚Äâ‚àû iff &quot;x&quot;‚Äâ=‚Äâ0, &quot;v&quot;(&quot;xy&quot;) = &quot;v&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)‚Äâ+‚Äâ&quot;v&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) and &quot;v&quot;(&quot;x&quot;‚Äâ+‚Äâ&quot;y&quot;) ‚â• min(&quot;v&quot;(&quot;x&quot;),&quot;v&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)) for all &quot;x&quot;,‚Äâ&quot;y&quot;‚Äâ‚àà‚Äâ&quot;K&quot;, and &quot;v&quot;(&quot;a&quot;)‚Äâ=‚Äâ0 for all &quot;a&quot;‚Äâ‚àà‚Äâ&quot;k&quot;‚Äâ\‚Äâ{0}.

There are natural bijective correspondences between the set of valuation rings of &quot;K&quot;/&quot;k&quot;, the set of places of &quot;K&quot;/&quot;k&quot;, and the set of discrete valuations of &quot;K&quot;/&quot;k&quot;. These sets can be given a natural topological structure: the Zariski‚ÄìRiemann space of &quot;K&quot;/&quot;k&quot;.

<doc id="447650" wikidata="Q32704" url="?curid=447650" title="Venda language">
<text>Ven·∏ìa or Tshiven·∏ìa is a Bantu language and an official language of South Africa and Zimbabwe. It is mainly spoken by the Venda people (or Vhaven·∏ìa) in the northern part of South Africa&#x27;s Limpopo province, as well as by some Lemba people in South Africa. The Tshivenda language is related to the Kalanga language which is spoken in Southern Africa. During the apartheid era of South Africa, the Bantustan of Venda was set up to cover the Venda speakers of South Africa.

According to the 2011 census, Venda speakers are concentrated in the following areas: Makhado Local Municipality, with 350,000 people; Thulamela Local Municipality, with 370,000 people; Musina Local Municipality, with 35,000 people; and Mutale Local Municipality, with 89,000 people. The total number of speakers in Vhembe district currently stands at 844,000. In Gauteng province, there are 275,000 Venda speakers. Fewer than 10,000 are spread across the rest of the country‚Äîfor a total number of Venda speakers in South Africa at 1.2¬†million people or just 2.2% of South Africa&#x27;s population, making Venda speakers the second smallest minority language in South Africa, after the Ndebele language, which number 1.1¬†million speakers. The population statistics of the Venda people in Zimbabwe are not clear but may currently stand at a million. The people are concentrated in the South of the country but also spread to other towns and cities. There is also a significant number of them in neighbouring South Africa where they are migrant workers.

==Writing system==
The Venda language uses the Latin alphabet with five additional accented letters. There are four dental consonants with a circumflex accent below the letter (&quot;·∏ì, ·∏Ω, ·πã, ·π±&quot;) and an overdot for velar &quot;·πÖ&quot;. Five vowel letters are used to write seven vowels. The letters C, J and Q are used only for foreign words and names.


===Unicode===
The extra letters have the following Unicode names: 
* ·∏í U+1E12 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D WITH CIRCUMFLEX BELOW
* ·∏ì U+1E13 LATIN SMALL LETTER D WITH CIRCUMFLEX BELOW
* ·∏º U+1E3C LATIN CAPITAL LETTER L WITH CIRCUMFLEX BELOW
* ·∏Ω U+1E3D LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH CIRCUMFLEX BELOW
* ·πÑ U+1E44 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N WITH DOT ABOVE
* ·πÖ U+1E45 LATIN SMALL LETTER N WITH DOT ABOVE
* ·πä U+1E4A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N WITH CIRCUMFLEX BELOW
* ·πã U+1E4B LATIN SMALL LETTER N WITH CIRCUMFLEX BELOW
* ·π∞ U+1E70 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T WITH CIRCUMFLEX BELOW
* ·π± U+1E71 LATIN SMALL LETTER T WITH CIRCUMFLEX BELOW

===Lu·π±hofun·∏ìeraru lwa Mibvumo===

The &quot;sintu&quot; writing system &quot;Isibheqe Sohlamvu/Ditema tsa Dinoko&quot;, known technically in Venda as &quot;Lu·π±hofun·∏ìeraru lwa Mibvumo&quot;, is also used for the Venda language.
==Phonology==
Venda distinguishes dental &quot;·π±, ·π±h, ·∏ì, ·πã, ·∏Ω&quot; from alveolar &quot;t, th, d, n, l&quot; as well as (like in Ewe) labiodental &quot;f, v&quot; from bilabial &quot;fh, vh&quot; (the last two are slightly rounded). There are no clicks. As in other South African languages like Zulu, &quot;ph, ·π±h, th, kh&quot; are aspirated and the &quot;plain&quot; stops &quot;p, ·π±, t,&quot; and &quot;k&quot; are ejective.

===Vowels===
There are five vowel sounds in Tshiven·∏ìa. 
===Consonants===
A labiodental nasal sound appears in prenasalised consonant sounds. Labiovelar sounds occur as alternatives to labiopalatal sounds and may also be pronounced . Fortition of occurs after nasal prefixes, likely to .

===Tones===
Venda has a specified tone, , with unmarked syllables having a low tone. Phonetic falling tone occurs only in sequences of more than one vowel or on the penultimate syllable if the vowel is long. Tone patterns exist independently of the consonants and vowels of a word and so they are word tones. Venda tone also follows Meeussen&#x27;s rule: when a word beginning with a high tone is preceded by that high tone, the initial high tone is lost. (That is, there cannot be two adjacent marked high tones in a word, but high tone spreads allophonically to a following non-tonic (&quot;low&quot;-tone) syllable.) There are only a few tone patterns in Venda words (no tone, a single high tone on some syllable, two non-adjacent high tones), which behave as follows:

<text>Luwan District (; Shanghainese: lu1uae1 chiu1, pinyin: L√∫wƒÅn Q≈´; formerly romanized as Lokawei) was a district located in central Shanghai, until its merger with Huangpu District in June 2011. It had an area of and population of 350,000 as of 2001.

==Location==
Luwan district was located directly south of People&#x27;s Square. The northern part of Luwan included one of the best sections of Huaihai Road, famous for its international fashion shops and high-class restaurants.

==History==
Luwan was a part of the old French Concession area, one of the most prestigious sections of the city. It was famous for its boulevards. The plane trees lining the main streets were imported from France over 100 years ago. The district included the historical residences of Sun Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Agnes Smedley and Mei Lanfang, among others.
It was announced on June 8, 2011, that the proposed plan of merging Luwan and Huangpu districts had been approved by the State Council. Since the new district would still maintain the name Huangpu, Luwan as a district ceased to exist.

==Name origin==
The district was named after &quot;Lujia Wan&quot; (), formerly a bend in a local river which had since been covered up. The name survived in bus stops located near the former location of the bay. Known as Lukawei during the French Concession period, this was the location of the main police depot and prison of the French Concession.

<text>The Southern Tier is a geographic subregion of the broader Upstate region of New York State, geographically situated along or very near the state border with Pennsylvania. Definitions of the region vary widely, but generally encompass counties surrounding the Binghamton and Elmira-Corning metropolitan areas. This region is adjacent to the Northern Tier of Pennsylvania, and both these regions together are known as the Twin Tiers.

Geographically, most of the Southern Tier resides in the Allegheny Plateau of the Appalachian Mountains, with the eastern areas of the region nestled in the western portion of the Catskill Mountains. A longtime home of the Iroquois Confederacy, European settlers moved to the region after the American Revolutionary War. The fertile yet hilly land, combined with sweeping river valleys, led the region to support a combination of manufacturing industries (including large companies such as IBM and Corning Inc.) and farming, but with less development compared to neighboring subregions of Upstate. Since the 1950s, the area is often considered to be a part of the Rust Belt, as manufacturing jobs have left the region.

==Constituent counties==
The Southern Tier is commonly considered to consist of 8 counties:
The Southern Tier is not a legally defined region. Due to this, various neighboring counties can be included in the region, while counties near other regions of New York State may be excluded. For example, some organizations consider Delaware County, Otsego County, Schoharie County and Cortland County to reside in the Southern Tier. 

The Encyclopedia of New York State lists only Chautauqua County, Cattaraugus County, Allegany County, and Steuben County as part of the Southern Tier, with anything east of that being considered Central New York. Other definitions define it as comprising the combined Corning-Elmira-Binghamton Metropolitan Statistical Areas, which includes Steuben, Chemung, Tioga and Broome Counties but not Chautauqua, Cattaraugus or Allegany, which are considered Western New York. 

The New York State Division of Local Government Services presently classifies the following fourteen counties as members of the Southern Tier: Allegany, Broome, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Chemung, Chenango, Cortland, Delaware, Otsego, Schoharie, Schuyler, Steuben, Tioga, and Tompkins. This definition corresponds to the same 14 counties in New York State that are members of the Appalachian Regional Commission formed in 1963.

Much of the Southern Tier is in area code 607, with the exception of Allegany, Cattaraugus, and Chautauqua Counties, which are in area code 716 or area code 585. As of 2023, the westernmost portion of the Southern Tier is located in New York&#x27;s 23rd congressional district, and the easternmost portion is located in New York&#x27;s 19th congressional district. The ZIP code prefixes 147 (Jamestown region), 148 ‚Äì 149 (Elmira region), and 137 ‚Äì 139 (Binghamton region) are set aside for the Southern Tier.

==Geography==

The Southern Tier is generally hilly without being mountainous (with the exception of the Catskill mountains). This can range from low rolling hills to more steep and rugged cliffs and valleys. The highest point in western New York is Alma Hill in Allegany County near the Steuben County line in the Southern Tier. Both the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers flow through the Southern Tier in their upper reaches, as does the Allegheny River in the western Southern Tier.

The Southern Tier makes up the northernmost portion of Appalachia and lies on the Allegheny Plateau. It is defined on its western boundary by the Chautauqua Ridge in Chautauqua County, and including this ridge and extending eastward across the northern bounds of the region, the continental divide between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watersheds exists. The Eastern Continental Divide runs directly through the region, in Steuben County.

The Southern Tier is more geographically linked with Pennsylvania and the Susquehanna River valley, at its confluence with the Chemung River, than it is with the remainder of New York State. Historically, the population of the Southern Tier came primarily from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and downstate New York (&quot;Yorkers&quot;). In contrast, the inhabitants of upper New York State came from New England (&quot;Yankees&quot;).

==History==

The Southern Tier has long been home to the people of the Iroquois Confederacy. There were major settlements along the Allegheny River in Cattaraugus County (which the Senecas acquired by defeating the Wenrohronon during the Beaver Wars in 1638) and at Painted Post in Steuben County, at what is today the northeast side of Corning, New York. The Seneca Nation has a reservation today along the Allegheny River and a headquarters at Salamanca. There are also Native lands (with no current Native residents) on Cuba Lake in Allegany County.

The colonies that eventually became the states of New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania all laid claim to the Southern Tier at various points in the 17th and 18th centuries, while not making any significant attempt to settle the territory.

The region was quickly settled by whites after the Revolutionary War, when settlers were again allowed west of the Appalachian divide. The Southern Tier shared in the economic growth of the early 19th century, but its hilly terrain made it less suitable to canal-building, and later, railroading, than the more-level corridor to the north between Albany and Buffalo. There was an attempt at a Genesee Valley Canal in the western half, and in the eastern half, the Chemung and Chenango Canals did connect the Erie Canal to Elmira and Binghamton respectively. Beset by financial and technical difficulties, the latter two canals nonetheless were important catalysts for economic growth, and indeed for the construction of the railroads that would supplant them. Plans to connect these canals to the Pennsylvania Canal system, thus making them much more than feeders to the Erie Canal, never came to fruition.

Railroads did arrive and the Erie Railroad, which followed the water-level of the Allegheny, Susquehanna and Delaware watersheds, accelerated industrial progress in the region about the time of the American Civil War. The railroad and available fuel from the region&#x27;s dense forests attracted Corning Glass Works to Steuben County in 1868.

The region became home to prosperous farms and small factory towns (with the exception of larger Binghamton) during the first half of the 20th century. But declines in U.S. manufacturing hit the region hard and it suffered even more than other parts of upstate New York and northern Pennsylvania.

The region&#x27;s addition to the Appalachian Regional Commission, often credited to the influence of U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, provided economic stimulus over the last 40 years. Government funds built the Southern Tier Expressway, highway links to the New York State Thruway, encouraged the growth of state colleges at Wellsville, Alfred and Binghamton and sought with mixed success to attract business interests relocating from the New York Metropolitan Area and urban Western New York.

For two decades, the region has tried to remake itself as a tourist destination and relocation area for retirees from big Northeastern cities. Meanwhile, agriculture and manufacturing struggle to compete regionally and globally.

==Education==
Binghamton University (the State University of New York-Binghamton) is one of the SUNY system&#x27;s four University Centers. Other 4-year and graduate institutions within the core counties include St. Bonaventure University, Alfred University, Elmira College, and Houghton College. Technical and community colleges include Alfred State College, Broome Community College, Corning Community College, and the State University of New York at Delhi. The region is also home to E.B.I. Career College, a vocational school.

Institutions of higher learning outside the core counties include Cornell University, Hartwick College, Ithaca College, SUNY Colleges in Cortland and Oneonta, Jamestown Community College, Fredonia, and Tompkins Cortland Community College.

==Transportation==
The Southern Tier Expressway ‚Äì Interstate 86 and New York State Route 17 ‚Äì serves the Southern Tier. The highway is the region&#x27;s major corridor and connects to U.S. Route 219 in Salamanca, Interstate 390 in Bath, Interstate 99 in Corning, U.S. Route 220 in Waverly, and Interstates 81 and 88 in Binghamton.

The region is served by three regional airports. Elmira-Corning Regional Airport has routes to Atlanta, Washington D.C., Detroit, and several destinations in Florida. The Greater Binghamton Airport offers Delta Airlines flights to Detroit. Chautauqua County-Jamestown Airport connects to Pittsburgh via Essential Air Service.

Bus service is provided along the entire I-86/NY 17 corridor by Coach USA&#x27;s Shortline/Erie services from Jamestown to New York City and Buffalo, and Trailways connects the Southern Tier with Buffalo, Dubois (at the western end in Salamanca), Sunbury/Lock Haven (at Elmira), and Syracuse, Albany and Harrisburg (at Binghamton). A somewhat-unorganized network of municipally-operated public transportation services operate local and limited intercity bus services between Salamanca and Elmira.

Until the demise of long-distance passenger rail service in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, the Erie Railroad operated passenger trains in the region, with Chicago, Illinois as the western terminus and Jersey City, New Jersey as the eastern terminus, with ferry connections to New York City. The last Erie Lackawanna passenger train, the &quot;Lake Cities&quot;, ran on January 6, 1970.

Amtrak currently does not serve the area. Proposals for high-speed rail in New York have included a route from Binghamton to New York City through Scranton, Pennsylvania: a route that could at least partially be upgraded for high-speed rail. As of 2011, the highest priority for high-speed rail projects in New York is in the Empire Corridor, of which no part crosses the Southern Tier. The hilly terrain of the Southern Tier&#x27;s I-86 corridor is not ideal for high-speed rail service, especially compared to the relatively flat and straight land in the Empire Corridor.

==Economy==

Government services are the largest employer in the area. Of second and declining importance is manufacturing. The region&#x27;s manufacturing economy has suffered for decades, but factories are found in the region&#x27;s larger communities. Fortune 500 materials maker Corning Inc. is headquartered in Steuben County. Broome County has a large high-tech industry and is the birthplace of IBM and flight simulation. In addition, other factories in the region make military aircraft, televisions, furniture, metal forgings and machine tools.

The area includes the northern extent of the Marcellus Formation and natural gas. Crude oil and oil sands continue to be extracted from Southern Tier wells as they have for over a century. There is significant debate about allowing hydraulic fracturing of the Marcellus Shale in the Southern Tier, which is currently banned in New York.

Cummins engine company has a large production facility located in Jamestown, NY. The Jamestown Engine Plant, established in 1974, is one of the top five heavy-duty diesel engine producers worldwide with production in recent years typically exceeding 100,000 engines annually. The JEP also remains one of the company&#x27;s largest manufacturing facilities, as it accounts for 12 percent of Cummins&#x27; total engine production in 2012.

Agriculture is also a major part of the economy. Leading products are dairy, vegetables, orchard fruit and wine grapes (the last of which typically grows only on the fringes of the Southern Tier, as the inland areas tend to not have a long enough growing season to support it). In addition, two prominent microbreweries, the Southern Tier Brewing Company in Lakewood, New York and the Ellicottville Brewing Company in Ellicottville, operate in the western Southern Tier.

The western and northern edges of the Southern Tier are known as ski country, and the hilly terrain (that forms a continental divide known as the Chautauqua Ridge) is notorious for frequent and heavy lake effect snow. As a result, Ellicottville has become a &quot;ski town&quot; with both the Holimont and Holiday Valley resorts in the vicinity; the two resorts draw numerous tourists, particularly from Canada, for which U.S. Route 219 provides easy access. At its peak in the 1960s, over a dozen ski resorts resided in the Southern Tier, many in Cattaraugus County, before most of them closed due to various assorted causes by the 1980s.

==Culture==

The Southern Tier is home to two professional symphony orchestras: the Binghamton Philharmonic in Binghamton and the Orchestra of the Southern Finger Lakes in Corning. Binghamton also has the Binghamton Youth Symphony and the Binghamton Community Orchestra.

The Tri-Cities Opera Company present full-scale operas in Binghamton.

==Media and entertainment==

Most of the Southern Tier is either served by the Elmira-Corning television market or the Binghamton television market. Cattaraugus and Allegany Counties are out of these stations&#x27; ranges, however, and are instead served by the Buffalo and Erie television markets. Two stations (more-or-less independent WVTT-CD and Retro Television Network owned-and-operated translator WBUO-LD) are licensed to Olean but serve Buffalo in practice.

The Olean, Elmira-Corning, and Binghamton radio markets directly serve the Southern Tier, and the Ithaca market indirectly serves some of the area. Seven Mountains Media is the dominant broadcaster in Olean and Elmira-Corning. iHeartMedia and Cumulus Media own station clusters only in Binghamton.

Notable newspapers include The Leader of Corning, the Elmira Star-Gazette, the Binghamton Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin, Hornell Evening Tribune, the Wellsville Daily Reporter, the Olean Times Herald, the Salamanca Press, The Post-Journal of Jamestown, and The Observer of Dunkirk. The Tribune, Reporter and Leader are all owned by GateHouse Media; Gannett Company owns the Star-Gazette and Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin.

The Southern Tier has an eclectic history of sports. From 1979 to 2009 the LPGA Corning Classic was held at the Corning Country Club. Endicott&#x27;s En-Joie Golf Course hosted a PGA Tour event, the B.C. Open, from 1971 until 2006. It then became the Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Open which is a PGA Tour Champions event still played each summer. Binghamton has a AA baseball team, the Binghamton Rumble Ponies, and a Federal Prospects Hockey League franchise, the Binghamton Black Bears. Depending on the boundary definition, Watkins Glen International Speedway, a NASCAR and Indy Racing League sanctioned road racing track, is located in the Southern Tier region.

From 2000 to 2017, Elmira had a professional ice hockey team in the Elmira Jackals. They played in the United Hockey League from 2000 to 2007 and the ECHL for the franchise&#x27;s remaining years. The Jackals were replaced by a new Federal Hockey League franchise called the Elmira Enforcers from 2018 to 2021. The last minor league baseball team in the Southern Tier west of Binghamton, the Jamestown Jammers, relocated out of the area in 2016, ending an era in which the New York‚ÄìPenn League featured pro teams in Jamestown, Olean, Wellsville, Hornell, Corning, Elmira and Oneonta over the course of its history; collegiate summer baseball still thrives in the region in the form of the New York Collegiate Baseball League and Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League, both with multiple teams in the region, and Town Team Baseball also operated in the form of the Southwestern New York Men&#x27;s Baseball League from 2014 to 2016. Only one major league franchise has ever resided in the Southern Tier: the professional basketball team Elmira Colonels, which played from 1952 to 1953.
