==Corporate profile==
The &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; is part of the Fujisankei Communications Group and is 40% owned by Fuji Media Holdings. The company is also the owner of Osaka Broadcasting Corporation (OBC, Radio Osaka).

==History==
The &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; was created by the merger of two older newspapers: &quot;Jiji News&quot; and &quot;Nihon Kogyō Shimbun&quot;. &quot;Jiji News&quot; was founded in 1882 by author, translator, and journalist Fukuzawa Yukichi, who also founded Keio University. &quot;Nihon Kogyō Shimbun&quot;, founded in 1933 by Hisakichi Maeda, specialized in business and was published by the &quot;Minami-Osaka Shimbun&quot; (the &quot;South Osaka Evening newspaper&quot;). In 1941, the &quot;Osaka Shimbun&quot; (renamed from &quot;Minami-Osaka Shimbun&quot;) merged with &quot;Osaka Jiji Shimpō&quot; (&quot;Jiji-Shimpō Osaka edition&quot;). The following year, &quot;Nihon Kogyō Shimbun&quot; merged with other business newspapers in Western Japan, and changed its name to the &quot;Sangyō Keizai Shimbun&quot; (or the &quot;Sankei&quot;). In 1955, the &quot;Sankei&quot; merged with &quot;Jiji Shimpō.&quot; In 1959, the &quot;Sankei&quot; and &quot;Jiji Shimpō&quot; were placed under the &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; masthead.

In 1958, the &quot;Sankei&quot; was acquired by Shigeo Mizuno and Nobutaka Shikanai. After financial difficulties, it changed direction from being liberal to being conservative (Tenkō). Both Mizuno and Shikanai would go on to found Fuji Television a year later.

The &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; started two online newspapers in 1996: &quot;Sankei Web&quot;, in website style, and &quot;E-NEWS&quot;, in personal digital assistant style. In 2001, the &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; started a new electronic newspaper delivery edition, &quot;NEWSVUE&quot;. In 2002, the &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; merged with Osaka Shimbun. Both editions were placed under the Sankei Shimbun masthead. In 2005, the &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; added video to its digital edition, suitable for smartphone, and renamed it as &quot;Sankei NetView&quot;. In 2007, the &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; started a new online newspaper, , in collaboration with Microsoft. In 2014 the &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; rebranded its online news as &quot;Sankei News&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; launched the English language online website &quot;Japan Forward&quot;.

==Political stance==
The &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; is a nationalist and conservative newspaper. Some book and media outlets have called the &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; a far-right newspaper; The &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; has previously published books denying the atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II.

==Controversies==

In August 2014, South Korea filed suit against the &quot;Sankei&quot; for insults against president Park Geun-hye, published in one of the newspaper&#x27;s articles, and demanded Tatsuya Kato, head of the Seoul Bureau, present himself for questioning. The article in question covered several rumors about Park during the Sinking of the MV Sewol, referring to Korean news reports in the conservative newspaper &quot;Chosun Ilbo&quot;; however, only the &quot;Sankei&quot; was charged with defamation, considered an anti-Korean newspaper in Korea. The Japanese media assumed the suit was a warning to the &quot;Sankei&quot;. Kato, who was eventually acquitted of defamation charges in December 2015, was under prosecution without detention for a year and two months. The South Korean court said press freedoms were taken into consideration in arriving at Kato&#x27;s acquittal.

In December 2014, the newspaper apologized after running an advert for antisemitic books conspiracy theorist Richard Koshimizu.

On February 11, 2015, regular columnist Ayako Sono wrote an opinion piece opining that though she considered it necessary for Japan to accept more immigrants to bolster its decreasing workforce, it would also be necessary for Japan to take steps to ensure the separation of immigrants in regards to living conditions, citing South African apartheid as an example of how to achieve this goal.

In July 2015, &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; published the history book &quot;History Wars: Japan - False Indictment of the Century&quot;, which questioned the veracity of claims of Japanese war crimes during World War II.

In September 2015, several hundred academics and journalists were sent copies of &quot;History Wars&quot; and &quot;Getting Over it! Why Korea Needs to Stop Bashing Japan&quot;. The book mailings were part of a project by right-wing groups such as the &quot;Nippon Kaigi&quot; to improve international perceptions of Japan. A covering letter from politician Inoguchi Kuniko read in part: &quot;In East Asia, the regional history of the 20th century has been incorrectly distorted (sic) by some individuals due to their current domestic political ambitions, I believe it is important for you, as a highly esteemed member of the academic and policy circles (sic), to look into the books which I am enclosing with this letter.&quot;

<text>The Blackstone River in the United States is a river that flows through Massachusetts and Rhode Island. It is long with a drainage area of 475 mi2 (1229 km2). It drains into the Pawtucket River at Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Its long history of industrial use in the watershed has caused significant pollution, with the United States Environmental Protection Agency describing it as “the most polluted river in the country because of high concentrations of toxic sediments.”

== Name ==
The original Native American name for the river was the &quot;Kittacuck&quot; which meant &quot;the great tidal river.&quot; The &quot;Kittacuck&quot; used to be plentiful with salmon and lamprey in pre-colonial and colonial times.

In English, the river is named after William Blackstone (original spelling William Blaxton), who arrived in Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1623 and became the first European settler of present-day Boston in 1625. He relocated to Rhode Island in 1635 and built his home on the river, in what would become Cumberland.

==Course==
The river is formed in South-central Worcester, Massachusetts, by the confluence of the Middle River and Mill Brook. From there, it follows a rough southeast course past Worcester City and Northbridge. It then flows through Millbury, Sutton, Grafton, Northbridge, Uxbridge, Millville, and Blackstone. It continues into Rhode Island, flowing past Woonsocket, Cumberland, Lincoln, Central Falls, and Pawtucket, where it then reaches Pawtucket Falls. Following this, the river becomes tidal and flows into the Seekonk River just north of Providence. Other tributaries join the Blackstone along the way, such as the West River and Mumford River in Uxbridge, Massachusetts; and the Branch River, in North Smithfield, Rhode Island.

=== Tributaries ===
=== Crossings ===

==History==
Along with the Providence River, the Blackstone river served as the north-eastern border of Dutch claims for New Netherland from Adriaen Block&#x27;s charting of Narragansett Bay in 1614 through the Hartford Treaty of 1650.

 In 1790, Samuel Slater opened the first successful water-powered cotton mill in America: Slater Mill, at Pawtucket Falls. This mill was powered by the waters of the Blackstone River. Many other mills appeared along the Blackstone River over time, making it a significant American industrial location and contributing to the river becoming the main cause of the Narragansett Bay pollution by the end of the 20th century.

In August 1955, severe flooding on the Blackstone caused extensive damage to Woonsocket, Rhode Island. Whereas the river is usually wide, it swelled to over in width. The flooding of the Blackstone was the result of a succession of dam breaks, which were caused by rainfall from Hurricane Connie and Hurricane Diane a week later. In some parts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, these hurricanes resulted in a combined amount of more than of rain within a week. This led to the highest water mark on record for the Blackstone river in Woonsocket at , a full above flood stage.

The river, together with the Woonasquatucket River to the south, was designated an American Heritage River in 1998.

Canal System: To further facilitate industrial growth and transportation in the region, the Blackstone Canal was constructed in the early 19th century. The canal ran parallel to the river, providing a vital transportation route for goods between Worcester, Massachusetts, and Providence, Rhode Island. The Blackstone Canal played a significant role in the economic development of the region, allowing for the efficient movement of raw materials and finished products.

==Pollution and remediation efforts==
The Blackstone River has been significantly impacted by industrial activities and resulting pollution since the 18th century. Early industries discharged a variety of pollutants into the river, including dyes from textile mills,heavy metals and solvents from metal and woodworking industries. Metals are still being measured in sediments near and adjacent to the river.

The inaugural celebration of Earth Day, in 1970, increased public support for remediation projects. While environmental activists in the Blackstone River Valley were already organizing clean-up efforts locally, in 1971, a formalized plea for action was made to the then Governor of Rhode Island, Frank Licht. In December 1971, political support was pledged at the state level. The Blackstone River Watershed Association, which at the time was two years old, was designated to lead the effort. By April 1972, support among the public for cleaning the river increased. Additionally, the 1972 federal Clean Water Act (CWA) was passed by Congress, offering a framework for more protection of the water quality of The Blackstone River. While the CWA did not specifically mention The Blackstone River by name, it stated that the act &quot;establishes the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters.&quot;

In 1983, EPA identified concerns with impairment of water quality in The Blackstone River and established the Peterson/Puritan Superfund Site

Despite clean up efforts, the effects of industrial wastewater discharge into the river were long-lasting: in 1990, the United States Environmental Protection Agency called the Blackstone &quot;the most polluted river in the country with respect to toxic sediments.&quot; A 1990 Massachusetts Department of Public Health report said of the river: &quot;...that the condition of the Blackstone River is offensive throughout its course, from Worcester to the state line at Blackstone. The condition of the stream is likely to grow worse until effective measures are completed for removing from the river much of the pollution which it now receives.&quot;

Recent pollution can be partially traced to the Upper Blackstone Water Pollution Abatement District (UBWPAD), the wastewater treatment plant for Worcester, Massachusetts and surrounding communities, which discharges into the Blackstone. A 2005 report written by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management said, &quot;... [the] UBWPAD, North Attleboro, and Attleboro WWTFs play a significant role in the ability to improve water quality in the Providence and Seekonk River system [into which the Blackstone discharges], and efforts to reduce their nitrogen inputs should be initiated as soon as possible.&quot; In September 2010, the Conservation Law Foundation, citing this report, filed a lawsuit claiming that the discharge permit issued to the UBWPAD by the Environmental Protection Agency was not &quot;sufficient to meet state water quality standards&quot;.

River clean-up is ongoing and as of 2010, the Blackstone River was rated as the worst category (&quot;impaired&quot;) for all assessed uses (&quot;aquatic life&quot;, &quot;fish consumption&quot;, &quot;primary contact&quot; (e.g. swimming), &quot;secondary contact&quot; (e.g. boating) and &quot;aesthetics&quot;) up to its beginning at Middle River.

Processing problems at the Woonsocket sewage treatment plant and the consequent flow of solid waste into the river prompted no-contact advisories for the Rhode Island portion of the river in 2022.

<text>Spiritualized (stylised as Spiritualized®) are an English rock band formed in 1990 in Rugby, Warwickshire, by Jason Pierce (often known as J. Spaceman), formerly of Spacemen 3. After several line up-changes, in 1999, the band centred on Pierce (vocals, guitar), Doggen Foster (guitar) and Kevin Bales (drums and percussion) with revolving bassists and keyboard players. The band&#x27;s current bassist, James Stelfox, has been playing with the band since 2012.

As of 2023, Spiritualized have released nine studio albums. The best known and most critically acclaimed of these is 1997&#x27;s &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space&quot;, which &quot;NME&quot; magazine named as their Album of the Year, beating other critically acclaimed albums by fellow British bands such as &quot;OK Computer&quot; by Radiohead and &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; by The Verve.

==History==
===Formation: 1990–1991===
Following a breakdown in relations between Spacemen 3 co-frontmen Peter Kember and Jason Pierce, the group&#x27;s bassist Will Carruthers, drummer Jonny Mattock, and guitarist Mark Refoy were asked by Pierce to form a new group alongside local friend Steve Evans, subsequently calling themselves Spiritualized. The band took their name from an adaptation of the text on the back label of a bottle of Pernod. Due to formation from a majority of Spacemen 3 members, a technical clause meant that Spiritualized had to maintain the Spacemen 3 recording contract with Dedicated Records.

The first Spiritualized release, in 1990, was a cover of The Troggs&#x27; &quot;Anyway That You Want Me&quot;; the record heralded the official split of Spacemen 3 following contractual wrangles over the band&#x27;s name and its use in Spiritualized-related promotional material (initial copies of &quot;Anyway That You Want Me&quot; came with a Spacemen 3 logo on the sleeve).

===First releases: 1992–1998===
Evans was replaced on keyboards by Pierce&#x27;s then-girlfriend Kate Radley for the follow-up single, &quot;Run&quot;/&quot;I Want You&quot;. A number of singles followed, before the band, in early 1992, released their first LP &quot;Lazer Guided Melodies&quot;, which had been recorded in Rugby over the previous two years. Carruthers left the band before the release of the album and was replaced by Sean Cook in time for touring with The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain after the release of the album.

A second album, &quot;Pure Phase&quot;, was released in 1995, and a third, &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space&quot; emerged in 1997 to critical acclaim and commercial success. Following promotional activity for &quot;Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space&quot;, Gregg Hale left the band on good terms and remains friends with current members, but Sean Cook, Damon Reece and Michael Mooney threatened a strike in protest over low salaries and appearance fees. New contracts of employment were drawn up between Pierce and the musicians, and the same contracts were then used to fire them (to general disbelief by the music press at the time). In response, Cook, Reece and Mooney formed Lupine Howl.

===Development: 1999–2010===
Retaining only keyboardist Thighpaulsandra (keyboards), Jason Pierce then debuted a new line up of Spiritualized, introducing classical percussionist Tom Edwards and former Julian Cope string arranger Martin Schellard on bass guitar. Completing the new Spiritualized line-up were guitarist Doggen Foster of Brain Donor and the Julian Cope band, Richard Warren and drummer Kevin &#x27;Kevlar&#x27; Bales, who is also a member of Brain Donor. Jonny Aitken stepped in on drums for the recording of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; while Kevin Bales was recovering from illness. Chris Davis of Six By Seven &amp; Spotlight Kid also stepped in for Kevin for two major festival appearances. &quot;Let It Come Down&quot; included over 120 musicians. &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; favoured a more stripped-down sound with the gospel, blues, and soul influences even more dominant than before. On 15 June 1997, Spiritualized became the last band to play at Factory Records&#x27; Manchester nightclub The Haçienda.

After several years of work and Pierce&#x27;s serious illness in July 2005, the album, &quot;Songs in A&amp;E&quot; was released on 26 May 2008 in the UK, and on 27 May 2008 in the US. The first single from the 18-track album was &quot;Soul on Fire&quot;. The release was backed by an Electric Mainlines UK tour which began in May. Pierce has also scored Harmony Korine&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;Mister Lonely&quot;. In October and December 2009 the band performed 1997&#x27;s &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space&quot; live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties-curated Don&#x27;t Look Back series.

===Recent releases: 2011–present===
After more than two years in the making, while Pierce was undergoing experimental chemotherapy for a liver disease, and including a year long period of mixing, &quot;Sweet Heart Sweet Light&quot; was released in April 2012, on Double Six Records and Fat Possum in North America. The band had already played some of this new material over the past 3 years but not much else was known about the content of the album. The album cover, an octagon surrounding the word &quot;Huh?&quot; on a plain white background, is a reference to the working title of the album. In an interview regarding the new release it was revealed that the album would &quot;embrace&quot; more poppy songs compared to previous albums. In the same interview, Jason Pierce also said that the album was partly inspired by the experiences of performing &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space&quot; live in its entirety. In 2013, Jeremy McMahan (Dirty Blood, C is for Cookie) was brought in to some sessions to play bass.

&quot;And Nothing Hurt&quot; is the band&#x27;s eighth studio album released on 7 September 2018 through Bella Union in the United Kingdom and Fat Possum Records in the United States, and is the band&#x27;s first album in six years. The album was announced on 11 June 2018, along with the release of the album&#x27;s first singles, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot; and &quot;A Perfect Miracle&quot; and was produced by Jason Pierce.

On 2 November 2021, the band announced their ninth studio album, &quot;Everything Was Beautiful&quot;, slated for release on 25 February 2022 through Bella Union/PIAS Recordings. The seven-track album was previewed by a single called &quot;Always Together With You&quot;, which is a reworked version of a song from 2014 which was originally heard in demo form. On 3 February 2022, the release date was delayed to 22 April 2022, due to manufacturing issues.

==Musical style==
The band&#x27;s sound has been labelled as space rock, neo-psychedelia, experimental rock and garage rock. Their first album was also described by &quot;NME&quot; as being distantly connected to shoegaze.

<doc id="450042" wikidata="Q2151848" url="?curid=450042" title="Riders in the Sky (band)">
<text>Riders in the Sky is an American Western music and comedy group which began performing in 1977. The band has released more than 40 albums, starred in a single-season self-titled television series on CBS, wrote and starred in an NPR syndicated radio drama &quot;Riders Radio Theater&quot;, and appeared in television series and films including as featured contributors to Ken Burns&#x27; &quot;Country Music&quot;.
Their family-friendly style also appeals to children, exemplified in their recordings for Disney and Pixar. They have won two Grammy Awards and have written and performed music for major motion pictures, including &quot;Woody&#x27;s Roundup&quot; from &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; and Pixar&#x27;s short film, &quot;For the Birds&quot;. The band also recorded companion albums for &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; and &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;

==History==
=== Early years (1977–1979) ===
The Riders first performed on November 11, 1977 at Herr Harry&#x27;s Frank N&#x27; Steins in Nashville, TN. For this first performance, the Riders consisted of Deputy Doug (Douglas B. Green), Windy Bill Collins, and Fred LaBour. Happy with the crowds reaction, the Riders performed for the second time at Herr Harry&#x27;s the next evening. Between the second and third performances, the band still didn&#x27;t have a name, but that changed in December 1977, when Fred LaBour found a copy of The Sons of The Pioneers album &quot;Riders in the Sky&quot;. When LaBour saw the album, he immediately called Green and told him that Riders In The Sky should be the band&#x27;s name. Green agreed and from their third performance on, they were officially billed as Riders In The Sky. In 1978, Bill Collins left the Riders shortly after &quot;Tumbleweed Tommy&quot; Goldsmith joined. Shortly after Collins left, &quot;Woody Paul&quot; Chrisman also joined the band. In mid-1979, Tommy Goldsmith left the Riders shortly before the recording of their first album, which would become &quot;Three on the Trail&quot;. Goldsmith would perform on the Riders&#x27; second album, &quot;Cowboy Jubilee&quot;, in 1980, but not as a member of the band.

=== Rise in popularity (1980–1989) ===

==== Induction into the Grand Ole Opry (1982) ====
In 1982, Doug Green wrote a letter to Hal Durham, manager of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, telling him the Riders would like to join. Durham responded favorably; western music was under-represented in the Opry, and it wouldn&#x27;t conflict with the other materials and performances already in the Opry. After 26 appearances as a guest act, the Riders were officially inducted into the Opry on June 19, 1982.

==== &quot;Tumbleweed Theater&quot; (1983–1988) ====

In late 1982, the Riders were approached by Steve Arwood and Randy Hale to host a television show on The Nashville Network (which had not begun broadcasting yet) called &quot;Tumbleweed Theater&quot;. The premise of the show was that their 90-minute program would show heavily edited public domain &quot;B-Westerns&quot; of the 1930s and 40s with Riders In The Sky performing skits and songs before, in between, and after the films. After screening the movie that would be featured in the episode, Arwood and Fred LaBour wrote the sketches that played between the films, with many of the skits carrying over to the Riders&#x27; live shows and albums. &quot;Tumbleweed Theater&quot; premiered March 12, 1983, and continued for five seasons overall, the last two consisting of repackaged skits and songs.

==== &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; &amp; &quot;Wild Horses&quot; (1985) ====
In 1985, the Riders made their Hollywood debut when the trio landed parts in &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, a biographical film about the life of Patsy Cline. The band played The Jordanaires, although in the film they are never mentioned by name. After filming their part for Sweet Dreams, the Riders appeared as themselves in the made-for-television Kenny Rogers movie &quot;Wild Horses&quot;, where they performed their original compositions &quot;Here Comes The Santa Fe&quot; and &quot;Blue Bonnet Lady&quot; during a party scene.

==== &quot;Riders Radio Theater&quot; (1988–1995) ====

Beginning in 1988, Riders In The Sky were the stars of &quot;Riders Radio Theater&quot;, a weekly radio show written by Fred LaBour and Steve Arwood (now going by the stagename &quot;Texas Bix Bender&quot;) that was essentially the &quot;Tumbleweed Theater&quot; television show minus the &quot;B-Western&quot; films. The half-hour show was taped at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center in Nashville for the first year of episodes, but later moved to Cincinnati, Ohio beginning in 1989. The weekly show was canceled in 1995, but later came back as occasional specials beginning in 1998.

=== 1990–present ===

==== CBS Children&#x27;s show (1991) ====

In 1990, CBS approached the Riders to do a Saturday morning television show that would later be described as &quot;Pee-Wee&#x27;s Playhouse meets the wild west&quot;. Only airing for one season (a total of 13 episodes) due to low ratings and weekly schedule changes, the show was written by George McGrath instead of the Riders themselves. Fred LaBour reflected on the show, saying &quot;Everything we&#x27;ve had a hand in writing had been a success, we didn&#x27;t have a hand in that, and it wasn&#x27;t.&quot; The show premiered on September 14, 1991 as &quot;Riders In The Sky&quot; (although it has also been referred to as &quot;Saturday Mornings With Riders In The Sky&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

==== &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; and Grammys (1998–2002) ====
In 1998, Ash Brannon recommended to Disney and Pixar executives that Riders In The Sky be the performers of &quot;Woody&#x27;s Round-Up&quot; for their upcoming film &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. The executives were so impressed with the Riders&#x27; performance, they had the Riders create a tie-in album around the characters of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; called &quot;Woody&#x27;s Roundup: A Rootin&#x27; Tootin&#x27; Collection of Woody&#x27;s Favorite Songs&quot;. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children at the Grammy Awards of 2001.

After the success of the &quot;Woody&#x27;s Round-Up&quot; album, the Riders were called back into Pixar in 2002 to do another tie-in album, except based on Pixar&#x27;s latest film: &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; The album, titled &quot;Monsters, Inc. Scream Factory Favorites&quot;, won the Riders a second Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children at the Grammy Awards of 2003. In addition, the Riders wrote and performed the score of &quot;For the Birds,&quot; an animated short that showed before &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; in theaters. It won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 2001.

==== In animated form (2003–2015) ====
The Riders made their animated debut in 2003, in the Warner Bros. animated series &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot;, where they played a robot band modeled after themselves. Their second animated appearance was in Disney&#x27;s direct-to-DVD animated adventure children&#x27;s film titled &quot;Stanley&#x27;s Dinosaur Round-Up&quot;. Their most recent animated role was in the Kickstarter-funded film &quot;Cartoon Cowboys&quot; by WonderVista Studios. &quot;Cartoon Cowboys&quot; borrows heavily from Riders Radio Theater, including characters from the show and the Riders having the same personalities as their radio counterparts.

==== YellaWood spokesmen (2009) ====
The Riders appeared as musical spokesmen in a series of YellaWood commercials, which re-united the Riders with Steve Arwood (once again playing Texas Bix Bender) and featured a set similar to the one seen on &quot;Tumbleweed Theater&quot; (complete with a blue Studebaker pickup truck and the Riders performing on a Bunkhouse porch). The Riders also performed the theme song for YellaWood&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of&quot; &quot;Yella Fella&quot; and make cameos in the first episodes of seasons one and two.

==== Hiatus (2019–2021) ====
The Riders in the Sky went on an extended hiatus during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, in part because of Miskulin having extended health issues that prevented him from playing. The remaining members declined to make any of their usual &quot;Opry&quot; appearances during the pandemic; only Ranger Doug continued with any cowboy-related projects during the hiatus. The band resumed performing in 2021. , they perform on the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; several times per month.

<doc id="450045" wikidata="Q1432595" url="?curid=450045" title="Rickenbacker International Airport">
<text>Rickenbacker International Airport is a civil-military public airport south of downtown Columbus, near Lockbourne in southern Franklin County, Ohio, United States. The south end of the airport extends into Pickaway County. The base was named for flying ace and Columbus native Eddie Rickenbacker. It is managed by the Columbus Regional Airport Authority, which also operates John Glenn Columbus International Airport and Bolton Field. Rickenbacker International is primarily a cargo airport for the city of Columbus, although since 2012 it has served an increasing number of passenger flights as well as charter carriers.

The United States Air Force maintains a presence in the form of the Ohio Air National Guard&#x27;s 121st Air Refueling Wing. Rickenbacker International is also home of the Ohio Army National Guard&#x27;s Army Aviation Support Facility No. 2 and the headquarters for the Ohio Military Reserve, one of the state defense forces of Ohio.

In 1999 and 2007, the airport held Gatherings of Mustangs and Legends. Dozens of Mustang airplanes attended each time. The airport also hosted the Columbus Air Show in 2023.

==History==
The facility opened in June 1942 as Lockbourne Army Airfield, named for the nearby village of Lockbourne. Soon renamed the Northeastern Training Center of the Army Air Corps, it provided basic pilot training and military support; it also trained Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) to fly B-17 bombers and glider pilots to fly the Waco CG-4A. After the war, the airfield switched from flight training to developing and testing all-weather military flight operations. The primary unit at the base was the all-Black 447th Composite Group, also known as the Tuskegee Airmen.

During the Cold War, the facility was renamed Lockbourne Air Force Base and was assigned to the USAF Strategic Air Command, then on May 18, 1974, redesignated Rickenbacker Air Force Base by Department of the Air Force Special Order GA-11 of March 6, 1974, to honor Columbus native Eddie Rickenbacker, the leading American fighter pilot of World War I.

The base was transferred from the Strategic Air Command (SAC) to the Air National Guard and redesignated Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base on April 1, 1980.
The base was recommended for closure by the 1991 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, which would have moved the 121st Air Refueling Wing and the 160th Air Refueling Group of the Ohio Air National Guard to Wright-Patterson AFB. But following a proposal by the State of Ohio, the 1993 Commission recommended that the Air National Guard units remain at Rickenbacker, operating as tenants in a military cantonment area. The military facilities were renamed Rickenbacker Air National Guard Station on September 30, 1994, by the 1991 Commission.

In August 2001 construction started on a consolidated Navy and Marine Corps Air Reserve Center at Rickenbacker International Airport. The $10 million center, scheduled for completion in early 2003, sits at the intersection of 2nd Avenue and Club Street next to the Air National Guard facility. Developed by the Navy Reserve, the project consolidated the Naval Air Reserve Center at Rickenbacker with the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve Center on Yearling Road in Columbus. The nearly 1,000 Navy and Marine Corps reservists at the two reserve centers shifted their activities to the new facility, allowing the old Naval Air Reserve Center at Rickenbacker to be redeveloped by the Columbus Regional Airport Authority, which operates the airport.

In 2015, Cathay Pacific Cargo and Emirates SkyCargo boosted their services at the airport to support growth at the airport. Thanks to their additional service, logistics company Morrison Express launched operations at Rickenbacker in 2016 to support them.

A new Air Traffic Control tower was opened at the airport in 2016.

In 2018, the airport launched a $565,000 improvement project to boost the efficiency of its jetways. New ground power units and pre-conditioned air units were installed. Funding was provided largely from an FAA grant awarded as part of its Voluntary Airport Low Emissions program, which helps airports meet air quality standards set by the US Clean Air Act. 

That same year, the company upgraded its animal transport facility to ensure operational efficiency and animal safety. The facility earned U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) status as both a certified Export Inspection Facility and a Permanent Port of Embarkation for livestock. The upgrade included 12 new animal stalls and an on-site USDA office.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, airlines such as Emirates, Korean Air, and Etihad serviced the airport with passenger aircraft converted to transport loose cargo when demand for air travel waned and demand for freight continued to rise. On April 1, 2021, Rickenbacker and the CRAA celebrated the 500th arrival of a converted passenger plane: Emirates flight 2501 from Copenhagen.

In 2020, Rickenbacker was one of the most cost-effective small commercial airports in the country for passengers. It ranked as the third-cheapest airport of its size that year. The COVID-19 pandemic brought historical traffic levels to the airport. Monthly international arrivals peaked at 120 in 2020 and even higher in 2021 as airlines brought medical cargo in to the airport. 2021 was the airport&#x27;s best year to date due to the COVID-19 pandemic&#x27;s impact on cargo aviation. It was named the 2021 Airport of the Year by the Ohio Aviation Association for its role in bringing emergency protective equipment, its record-breaking shipments of international cargo, and receiving its first passenger aircraft converted for cargo.

Rickenbacker took part in an FAA research project on drones in 2021. It was one of five airports to participate in the agency’s Airport Unmanned Aircraft Systems Detection and Mitigation Research Program.

==Operations==
Rickenbacker was run by the Rickenbacker Port Authority, until merging in 2003 with Port Columbus and Bolton field creating the Columbus Regional Airport Authority. As of July 2006, Rickenbacker is the world&#x27;s 126th busiest cargo airport according to Air Cargo World. Rickenbacker ranks as one of the world&#x27;s top 20 fastest growing cargo airports in July 2006 with 112,888 tons, a 15.3% increase from the previous year. This is mainly due to the transfer of AirNet Systems operations from Port Columbus International Airport to Rickenbacker. This number is expected to increase with the introduction of the new intermodal facility that is under construction. As of now it has scheduled service from FedEx Express along with FedEx Feeder contractors, Mountain Air Cargo and CSA Air and UPS Airlines along with contractors Air Cargo Carriers. Multi-weekly 747 freighter service is operated by Atlas Air and Kalitta Air. Another airline based at Rickenbacker is Snow Aviation.

Rickenbacker International Airport was also the site for filming all aircraft exterior shots in the movie &quot;Air Force One&quot; starring Harrison Ford while also acting as Ramstein Air Base in the film. In 2007, Rickenbacker hosted the Gathering of Mustangs and Legends air show, one of the largest-ever gatherings of operable classic warbirds, especially the P-51 Mustang.

==Facilities and aircraft==
Rickenbacker International Airport covers and has two runways and one helipad:

* Runway 05R/23L: , surface: asphalt/concrete
* Runway 05L/23R: , surface: asphalt
* Helipad H1: , surface: concrete

In the year ending December 31, 2022 the airport had 24,168 aircraft operations, average 66 per day: 52% commercial, 35% general aviation, and 14% military. At the time, 50 aircraft were based at the airport: 32 military aircraft, 10 jets, 4 single-engine, and 4 multi-engine airplanes.

The airport has a fixed-base operator that offers fuel – both avgas and jet fuel – as well as services such as conference rooms, a crew lounge, snooze rooms, showers, and courtesy transportation.

In December 2006, PlanetSpace entered negotiations with the Ohio government to build a spaceport at Rickenbacker. The company has since been dissolved by the Government of Canada.

Also in 2006, the Columbus Regional Airport Authority completed a noise compatibility study for the airport. This program helps to guide suggested flight paths and targets soundproofing of buildings exposed to high levels of aircraft noise.

AirNet Express headquarters is at the airport.

In 2008, Norfolk Southern opened the Rickenbacker Intermodal Terminal next to the airport. This facility allows the handling of approximately 250,000 Intermodal containers annually and anchors Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Heartland Corridor. The project allows easy access to and from the deep water port at Norfolk, Virginia via the use of double stack containers as well as improved access to rail hubs in the Chicago area.

In February 2022, Kintetsu World Express opened a sales office at the airport.
==Airlines and destinations==
Since the completion of the current passenger terminal in 2003, Rickenbacker has acted as a secondary airport for Columbus and has seen a number of carriers come and go, including Southeast Airlines, Boston-Maine Airways, Hooters Air, Direct Air, USA3000 Airlines, Fly Mission Air, and Vision Airlines. In 2012, low-cost carrier Allegiant Air launched service to Sanford and St. Petersburg, FL and has since been successful in expanding service to ten additional leisure destinations in the Southern United States. Today, Allegiant is the sole passenger airline in Rickenbacker.

Multiple major cargo airlines, including a number of international carriers, also operate at Rickenbacker International Airport.

== Accidents and incidents ==

* On December 5, 2007, a Cessna 208 Super Cargomaster crashed after departure from Rickenbacker. The airplane received its takeoff clearance at 06:48 and departed at 06:50. Radar track data indicated that the airplane climbed to about 1,100 feet mean sea level (msl) and was in a left turn with a ground speed of about 109 knots prior to descending and impacting the terrain. The airplane impacted terrain on an approximate heading of 120 degrees. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the pilot&#x27;s failure to maintain aircraft control and collision avoidance with terrain due to spacial disorientation. Contributing to the accident were the low cloud ceiling and night conditions.
* On September 1, 2008, a Convair CV-580 was destroyed when it impacted terrain as it was attempting to return to the Rickenbacker International Airport after departure. The accident flight was the first flight following a maintenance Phase 1 and Phase 2 check, which included flight control cable rigging as part of the check. The flight was also intended to provide cockpit familiarization for the first officer and the observer, and a training flight for the first officer. One minute after departure the flight contacted ATC and stated that it needed to return to LCK. It was cleared to land and declined standby emergency equipment. When the airplane was approximately turning to the base leg, it was about 187 feet agl on a southerly heading with a 196-knot ground speed. About 1206, the airplane impacted a cornfield about one mile southwest of the approach end of runway 5L. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the improper (reverse) rigging of the elevator trim cables by company maintenance personnel, and their subsequent failure to discover the misrigging during required post-maintenance checks.
* On June 19, 2011, a Cirrus SR-22 collided with the terrain following a loss of control shortly after takeoff from the Rickenbacker International Airport. The controller stated he watched the airplane takeoff and begin a left turn into the clouds. The controller then instructed the pilot to contact departure control, but the pilot never made the switch, and smoke appeared on the southwest side of the airport. A line person who fueled the airplane and a fireman who worked at the airport both reported that the airplane engine sounded normal prior to the accident. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the pilot&#x27;s spatial disorientation during the takeoff into instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in his failure to maintain control of the airplane.
* On May 9, 2014, a Cessna 525C was substantially damaged during an engine start at Rickenbacker International Airport. The flight crew had initiated a start sequence on the left engine when witnesses outside the airplane notified them of a fire in the left engine. The flight crew then shut down both engines, closed the left firewall shutoff, activated the fire bottle, and all four occupants evacuated through the main cabin door. The fire continued to burn and was extinguished by fire fighting crews. The probable cause of the incident was found to be the flight crew’s decision to attempt an engine start in conditions that exceeded the engine&#x27;s maximum allowable ground start crosswind component limitation.

<text>Spring Arbor University (SAU) is a private Free Methodist university in Spring Arbor, Michigan. Developing from an earlier academy and junior college, in 1963 it began offering bachelor&#x27;s degrees. Attaining university status in 1994, it is the second-largest evangelical Christian university in Michigan. The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

==History==
Spring Arbor University has developed in the late 20th century from a seminary founded in 1873 by leaders of the Free Methodist Church, particularly Edward Payson Hart. First Spring Arbor Seminary was established as a private academy for elementary and secondary grades. Located near the site of a former Potawatomi Indian village, the academy was built on property that formerly belonged to Central Michigan College (later renamed as Hillsdale College after moving to that city).

In 1923, the board of trustees voted to add a junior college to the academy. In 1929, the school was renamed as Spring Arbor Seminary and Junior College. Primary and intermediate classes were discontinued in 1930.

In 1960, the school gained accreditation by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, and the trustees changed the name of the institution to Spring Arbor College. The high school program was dropped, and Spring Arbor launched its four-year program in 1963.

In 1981, Spring Arbor began offering the first of its degree completion programs for adult learners in nearby Jackson. The college later developed degrees in health-related fields and opened sites in Lansing and Flint, Michigan. Graduate education classes were begun at Spring Arbor in 1994. In 2001, the school changed its name to Spring Arbor University.
A marker designating the college as a Michigan Historic Site was erected by the Michigan Historical Commission in 1963. The inscription reads:

Three Michigan institutions of higher education have had their roots here. The predecessor of Albion College, the Spring Arbor Seminary was chartered in 1835. Michigan Central College, founded in 1844, was located here until its removal in 1855 when it became Hillsdale College. Spring Arbor was opened by free Methodists in 1873 as an academy with elementary and secondary grades. In 1928 the elementary program was discontinued when a junior college was officially introduced. The high school was terminated in 1961 when a senior college was proposed. In September 1963, the first junior class was accepted into the regionally accredited four-year liberal arts college. Throughout its history, the Spring Arbor Faculty and students have been dedicated to &quot;the serious study of the liberal arts, commitment to Jesus Christ as a perspective for learning and participation in the campus community and the contemporary world.&quot;

==Academics==

SAU offers over 70 majors and programs at the undergraduate level at its main campus in Spring Arbor, Michigan. Its most popular undergraduate majors, in terms of 2021 graduates, were:
::Social Work (82)
::Nursing Administration (67)
::Operations Management &amp; Supervision (40)
::Business Administration &amp; Management (24)
::Sports, Kinesiology &amp; Physical Education/Fitness (18)
::General Studies (17)

Spring Arbor University also offers online undergraduate degree options including Associate of Arts and Associate of Science in business, Bachelor of Science in business, Bachelor of Science in Management, Bachelor of Social Work, and Bachelor of Science in Nursing.

In regard to graduate programs, SAU offers Master of business administration, Master of Arts in education, Master of Science in management, Master of Science in nursing, Master of Arts in social work and Master of Arts in counseling degrees.

The university is a member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities and is affiliated with the Free Methodist Church. The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. SAU also holds accreditation from the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education.

In the late 1980s, Michael A. O&#x27;Donnell, Ph.D. and Nick Stinnett, Ph.D. (professor with the University of Alabama) co-founded The International Family Life Institute, Inc., Montgomery, Alabama, which was hired by SAU to help them pioneer the first B.S. degree completion program in Family Life Education on the campus of Spring Arbor University leading to certification for professionals as Certified Family Life Educators (CFLE)

In 2020, the university terminated the contracts of 11 faculty, including several tenured faculty. In response, the faculty passed a vote of no confidence in the VPAA.

==Student life==
As of Fall 2018, total enrollment included 3,436 students. Of this, 1,145 are on campus, 662 are enrolled in professional studies, and 1,629 are graduate students. By Fall 2021, on campus enrollment had fallen to 961. There are roughly 42 denominations represented on the campus. About 84 percent of students are from Michigan, 15 percent are from 22 other states, and 1 percent are international.

Spring Arbor University has two radio stations: 106.9 HOME.fm and 89.3 The Arbor. 89.3 The Arbor has been previously known as 89.3 The Vibe and 89.3 The Message.

With a strong emphasis on spiritual life, Spring Arbor University requires that all students attend a chapel service on Mondays and Wednesdays at 10:05 am. This service includes student-led worship and speakers are pastors, entrepreneurs, professors and missionaries, handpicked by the Chaplain to bring their message to the SAU community. Aside from Chapel, there are campus groups and events designed to grow the spiritual life of students including Spiritual Life Retreat, small groups, and the Community of Learners program. SAU also hosts a one-day event annually called The Focus Series. During this day, classes are canceled and various workshops and seminars are held on campus. Speakers have included emergent church spokesperson and author Brian McLaren.

== Discrimination against LGBTQ people ==
Spring Arbor University has faced numerous accusations of discrimination against LGBTQ students and faculty members. One such instance took place in 2007, when a faculty member was terminated after coming out as transgender.

In the fall of 2017, a speaker at SAU&#x27;s twice-weekly chapel service was met with applause after placing LGBTQ people in the same category as drug addicts and murderers. His sermon stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t have time to tell you the stories of lesbians that come to our church and repent of their sins and now are living straight lives. I don&#x27;t have time to tell you about murderers who walk in and they get changed by the power of God, I can&#x27;t tell you the drug dealers who actually hand me drugs and say, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to do this anymore.&#x27; And it&#x27;s not by my might, it&#x27;s not by my power, it is by the spirit of the Lord.&quot;

In 2018, Dr. Everett Piper (an alumnus, former SAU administrator, and former president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University) posted what the &quot;New York Times&quot; referred to as &quot;a long, vitriolic response to stories in The Pulse, a student news source at his alma mater, Spring Arbor University in Michigan, in which gay students were seeking affirmation and conversation.&quot; In this statement, Piper compared LGBTQ students to white supremacists, saying &quot;How about &#x27;a conversation about how to bring feelings of white supremacy and faith into the light&#x27; at the local Christian college?&quot; he wrote. Why, he asked, &quot;do we &#x27;normalize&#x27; one sinful habit and predisposition but yet still condemn another?&quot;

The SAU student handbook currently prohibits &quot;same-sex dating behaviors,&quot; and states that those who violate this community standard will be offered &quot;counsel and support to encourage students towards living lives consistent with the biblical teaching on sexuality,&quot; and may also be subject to suspension or dismissal. It also states that students&#x27; clothing must be &quot;gender-appropriate&quot; and that the university &quot;will not support persistent or conspicuous expressions or actions that are deliberately discordant with birth gender.&quot;

SAU was granted a Title IX exemption in 2014, allowing the university to discriminate on religious grounds, which it still holds today.

==Athletics==
The Spring Arbor athletic teams are called the Cougars. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Crossroads League (formerly known as the Mid-Central College Conference (MCCC) until after the 2011–12 school year) since the 2004–05 academic year. They were also a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA), primarily competing as an independent in the Midwest Region of the Division I level. The Cougars previously competed in the Wolverine–Hoosier Athletic Conference (WHAC) from 1992–93 to 2003–04.

<text>Molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) is an epitaxy method for thin-film deposition of single crystals. MBE is widely used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including transistors. MBE is used to make diodes and MOSFETs (MOS field-effect transistors) at microwave frequencies, and to manufacture the lasers used to read optical discs (such as CDs and DVDs).

==History==
The original ideas of the MBE process were first established by K. G. Günther. Films that he deposited were not epitaxial, but were deposited on glass substrates. With the development of vacuum technology, the MBE process was demonstrated by John Davey and Titus Pankey who succeeded in growing GaAs epitaxial films on single crystal GaAs substrates using Günther&#x27;s method. Major subsequent development of MBE films was enabled by J.R. Arthur&#x27;s investigations of kinetic behavior of growth mechanisms and Alfred Y. Cho&#x27;s in situ observation of MBE process using reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) in the late 1960s.

==Method==
Molecular-beam epitaxy takes place in high vacuum or ultra-high vacuum (10−8–10−12 Torr). The most important aspect of an MBE process is the deposition rate (typically less than 3,000 nm per hour) that allows the films to grow epitaxially (in layers on top of the existing crystal). These deposition rates require proportionally better vacuum to achieve the same impurity levels as other deposition techniques. The absence of carrier gases, as well as the ultra-high vacuum environment, result in the highest achievable purity of the grown films.

In solid source MBE, elements such as gallium and arsenic, in ultra-pure form, are heated in separate quasi-Knudsen effusion cells or electron-beam evaporators until they begin to slowly sublime. The gaseous elements then condense on the wafer, where they may react with each other. In the example of gallium and arsenic, single-crystal gallium arsenide is formed. When evaporation sources such as copper or gold are used, the gaseous elements impinging on the surface may be adsorbed (after a time window where the impinging atoms will hop around the surface) or reflected. Atoms on the surface may also desorb. Controlling the temperature of the source will control the rate of material impinging on the substrate surface and the temperature of the substrate will affect the rate of hopping or desorption. The term &quot;beam&quot; means that evaporated atoms do not interact with each other or vacuum-chamber gases until they reach the wafer, due to the long mean free paths of the atoms.

During operation, reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) is often used for monitoring the growth of the crystal layers. A computer controls shutters in front of each furnace, allowing precise control of the thickness of each layer, down to a single layer of atoms. Intricate structures of layers of different materials may be fabricated this way. Such control has allowed the development of structures where the electrons can be confined in space, giving quantum wells or even quantum dots. Such layers are now a critical part of many modern semiconductor devices, including semiconductor lasers and light-emitting diodes.

In systems where the substrate needs to be cooled, the ultra-high vacuum environment within the growth chamber is maintained by a system of cryopumps and cryopanels, chilled using liquid nitrogen or cold nitrogen gas to a temperature close to 77 kelvins (−196 degree Celsius). Cold surfaces act as a sink for impurities in the vacuum, so vacuum levels need to be several orders of magnitude better to deposit films under these conditions. In other systems, the wafers on which the crystals are grown may be mounted on a rotating platter, which can be heated to several hundred degrees Celsius during operation.

Molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) is also used for the deposition of some types of organic semiconductors. In this case, molecules, rather than atoms, are evaporated and deposited onto the wafer. Other variations include gas-source MBE, which resembles chemical vapor deposition.
MBE systems can also be modified according to need. Oxygen sources, for example, can be incorporated for depositing oxide materials for advanced electronic, magnetic and optical applications. Here, a molecular beam of an oxidant is used to achieve the desired oxidation state of a multicomponent oxide.

==Quantum nanostructures==
One of the achievements of molecular-beam epitaxy is the nano-structures that permit the formation of atomically flat and abrupt hetero-interfaces. Most recently, the construction of nanowires and quantum structures built within them can allow for information processing and the possible integration with on-chip applications for quantum communication and computing. These heterostructure nanowire lasers are only possible to build using advanced MBE techniques, allowing monolithical integration on silicon and picosecond signal processing.

==Asaro–Tiller–Grinfeld instability==
The Asaro–Tiller–Grinfeld (ATG) instability, also known as the Grinfeld instability, is an elastic instability often encountered during molecular-beam epitaxy. If there is a mismatch between the lattice sizes of the growing film and the supporting crystal, elastic energy will be accumulated in the growing film. At some critical height, the free energy of the film can be lowered if the film breaks into isolated islands, where the tension can be relaxed laterally. The critical height depends on the Young&#x27;s modulus, mismatch size, and surface tension.

Some applications for this instability have been researched, such as the self-assembly of quantum dots. Some communities use the name of Stranski–Krastanov growth for ATG.

<doc id="450053" wikidata="Q1192147" url="?curid=450053" title="Habitat for Humanity">
<text>Habitat for Humanity International (HFHI), generally referred to as Habitat for Humanity or Habitat, is a U.S. non-governmental, and tax-exempt 501(C)(3) Christian nonprofit organization which seeks to build affordable housing. The international operational headquarters are located in Americus, Georgia, United States, with the administrative headquarters located in Atlanta. As of 2023, Habitat for Humanity operates in more than 70 countries.

Habitat for Humanity works to help build and improve homes for families of low-income or disadvantaged backgrounds. Homes are built using volunteer labor, including that of Habitat homeowners through the practice of sweat equity, as well as paid contractors for certain construction or infrastructure activities as needed. Habitat makes no profit from the sales.

The organization operates with financial support from individuals, philanthropic foundations, corporations, government entities, and mass media companies.

== History ==

Habitat for Humanity traces its roots to the establishment of the Humanity Fund by attorney Millard Fuller, his wife Linda, and Baptist theologian and farmer Clarence Jordan in 1968 at Koinonia Farm, an intercultural Christian intentional community farming community in Sumter County, Georgia, United States. With the funds, 42 homes were built at Koinonia for families in need.

In 1973, the Fullers decided to try the concept at a Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) mission in Mbandaka, Democratic Republic of Congo. After three successful years, the Fullers returned to the United States and founded Habitat for Humanity in 1976.

In 2022, in Tempe, Arizona, Habitat for Humanity 3D-printed walls for a house when not enough labor was available.

== Ongoing programs ==
===A Brush With Kindness===

Habitat for Humanity&#x27;s &quot;A Brush With Kindness&quot; is a locally operated program serving low-income homeowners who struggle to maintain the exterior of their homes. The program is a holistic approach to providing affordable housing and assisting both communities and families. Groups of volunteers help homeowners with exterior maintenance. This typically includes painting, minor exterior repairs, landscaping, weatherization and exterior clean-up.

== Affiliates ==
=== Jacksonville ===

Habitat for Humanity of Jacksonville (called HabiJax), is one of the larger affiliate of Habitat for Humanity (HFH) in the United States. Habijax was named the eighth-largest homebuilder in the United States by &quot;Builder&quot; magazine for 2009. HabiJax in 2023 marked 35 years of service and has provided homes to over 2,300 families.

==== History ====
The HabiJax affiliate was founded in 1988 by nine unnamed representatives from congregations in Jacksonville. Initial funding was secured from the Jessie Ball duPont Fund. Their first project was a house donated by the South Jacksonville Presbyterian Church that was moved, setup and rehabilitated for the first HabiJax homeowner family.

=== New York City ===
Habitat for Humanity New York City and Westchester County (Habitat NYC and Westchester) was founded in 1984 as an independent affiliate, serving families across the five boroughs through home construction and preservation, beginning with their first build on the Lower East Side, during the first Jimmy &amp; Rosalynn Carter Work Project. This 19-unit building on East 6th Street, the first Habitat building in New York City, was completed in December 1986. In 1995, four different New York City affiliates united to form one affiliate—Habitat NYC. In 2020, the affiliate expanded its work into Westchester, becoming Habitat NYC and Westchester. Karen Haycox was appointed CEO of Habitat NYC and Westchester in August 2015.

== Other special initiatives ==
=== Habitat Bicycle Challenge ===
The Habitat Bicycle Challenge (HBC), a nine-week, coast-to-coast bicycle trip undertaken to raise funds for Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven and to increase awareness of Habitat for Humanity in general, took place annually from 1995 to 2007. Prior to embarking in June on the trek, participants engaged in a seven-month fundraising campaign for Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven. Once on the road, they served as roaming advertisements for Habitat and gave nightly presentations explaining Habitat&#x27;s mission to their hosts, usually church congregations. They also took part in builds with local Habitat chapters along the way.

At its height, HBC attracted about 90 participants a year, all aged 18 to 24 and about half coming from Yale University. Each rider traveled one of three routes: New Haven to San Francisco, New Haven to Portland, or New Haven to Seattle. By 2004 HBC had become the single largest yearly fundraiser for any Habitat affiliate in the world, raising about $400,000 a year. However, amid growing safety concerns, Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven was forced to announce the cancellation of HBC in September 2007.

== Criticism ==
;Cost-effectiveness
Habitat has been criticized for its slow and inefficient rebuilding efforts along the Gulf Coast after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. An article in the &quot;Weekly Standard&quot;, a conservative American opinion magazine, questioned the cost-effectiveness of Habitat building projects. To estimate cost effectiveness, the magazine alleged that all costs associated with building a Habitat home must be used, including the cost of volunteer time and training. Habitat affiliates in the region have remained some of the largest homebuilders in their areas and have received numerous awards and acknowledgements for their work in building quality homes.

;Partnering with low-income families
Families are required to show an ability to pay for their home in addition to the need for housing. With these requirements, homeless and low-income families may fail to qualify for a Habitat home. Most American Habitat affiliates perform credit checks and criminal record checks on applicants before partnering with them for the construction of a home. Some critics therefore allege that Habitat misrepresents the nature of its work by partnering with families that might be considered nearly &quot;middle-income&quot;. To address this, many Habitat affiliates in the United States partner only with families that fall below the government-set &quot;poverty line&quot; for their area. The current poverty rate is measured according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

;Ousting of the founder
The Habitat board investigated Millard Fuller for sexual harassment but found &quot;insufficient proof of inappropriate conduct.&quot; Some Fuller supporters claim that the firing was due to a change in corporate culture. Before Fuller&#x27;s termination, attempts were made by former President Jimmy Carter to broker an agreement that would allow Fuller to retire with his $79,000 salary intact; when Fuller was found to have violated the non-disclosure portion of this agreement, he was subsequently fired, and his wife, Linda was also fired.

<text>The third HMS &quot;Argyll&quot; is a Type 23 Duke-class frigate. Commissioned in 1991 and prior to her retirement, &quot;Argyll&quot; was the oldest serving Type 23 frigate in the Royal Navy. Like all of her class she was named after a British dukedom, in this case that of Argyll. HMS &quot;Argyll&quot; was laid down in March 1987 by Yarrow Shipbuilders at Glasgow, and launched in 1989 by Lady Wendy Levene, sponsored by the Worshipful Company of Paviors.

&quot;Argyll&quot; was the first Type 23 to be fitted with the new Sea Ceptor missile system. The ship, like her sisters HMS &quot;Monmouth&quot;, HMS &quot;Montrose&quot;, HMS &quot;Lancaster&quot; and HMS &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, did not receive the new Sonar 2087 upgrade that other frigates of the class subsequently received. Therefore she was regarded as a &quot;general purpose&quot; frigate without the more specialized anti-submarine capability of the other eight ships in the Type 23 fleet.

&quot;Argyll&quot; was retired and sold to BAE Systems for apprentice training in 2024.

==Operational history==

===1991–2000===
On 26 March 1994, &quot;Argyll&#x27;s&quot; Lynx helicopter crashed into the sea off Andros Island in the West Indies while practising for an air display. The crew escaped and were rescued but the aircraft was unrecoverable after sinking in 5,000ft of water.

In 2000, &quot;Argyll&quot; was part of the Royal Navy task force – Task Group 342.01 – comprising , , , , and four RFA ships – that deployed to Sierra Leone as part of the British military intervention in the Sierra Leone civil war. During those operations, &quot;Argyll&quot; acted as the West African Guardship and remained off West Africa until September 2000. Throughout this period &quot;Argyll&quot; operated with her Lynx HMA Mk 8 helicopter. The Lynx undertook daily patrols and searches. The Lynx was instrumental to the successful completion of Operation Barras. During her deployment, the helicopter was scrambled to search for a missing passenger ferry. The aircraft&#x27;s crew quickly located the vessel and provided escort for &quot;Argyll&quot;. &quot;Argyll&quot; saved fifty-eight lives from drowning. She was relieved by her sister-ship in September. During this incident &quot;Argyll&quot;, assisted by HMS &quot;Ocean&quot;, laid the foundation for the Iron Duke Community School. This is a school for orphans in Freetown. President Kabbah of Sierra Leone decreed the school be named after the crew of for completing the construction of the six classrooms.

===2001–2010===
In 2001, while in the Bay of Biscay, &quot;Argyll&quot; suffered an electrical fire that was quickly put out by the ship&#x27;s damage control team, with the ship suffering only minimal damage.

&quot;Argyll&quot; completed a six-month deployment to the Persian Gulf protecting two oil platforms, working with the American, Australian and Iraqi Navies from February to August 2005. The ship made a short visit to Boulogne, then to its home port of Inveraray and finally to Liverpool, before undergoing Operational Sea Trials. &quot;Argyll&quot; successfully completed Operational Sea Training and acted as a contingency platform whilst the Queen spent a week sailing on the in July 2006.

In September 2006 &quot;Argyll&quot; was deployed along with other ships such as and where she completed two drugs raids on merchant ships totalling . They completed their operation in November of the same year.

In October 2007 &quot;Argyll&quot; returned to the Persian Gulf to take over from her sister-ship, .

On 3 April 2008 more than 500 friends and relatives welcomed HMS &quot;Argyll&quot; as she returned to her home at Devonport after a deployment lasting six months in the Northern Persian Gulf. This was &quot;Argyll&quot;″s second Gulf deployment to Combined Task Force (CTF) 150 in three years. This deployment included one patrol which lasted 52 days from January to March 2008. HMS &quot;Argyll&quot; was also at the &#x27;Meet Your Navy&#x27; exhibition at HMNB Portsmouth 2008.

6 May 2008 saw the crew return to &quot;Argyll&quot;, with the crew bidding their commanding officer of seven months, Commander Gavin Pritchard, a fond farewell. Pritchard was succeeded by Commander Peter Olive. &quot;Argyll&quot; was then to engage in a period of trials and training before entering a period of maintenance in June.

11 May 2008 saw the Trans-Atlantic solo yacht race in Plymouth Sound started by the ceremonial cannon aboard &quot;Argyll&quot;. Dame Ellen MacArthur also attended the start of the race and Rear Admiral Richard Ibbotson, head of the Flag Officer Sea Training organisation, was also on board &quot;Argyll&quot;.

On 21 July 2008 &quot;Argyll&quot; led the parade of tall ships out of Liverpool ahead of the Tall Ships Race starting 23 July.

On 18 February 2009, &quot;Argyll&quot; sailed from Devonport as part of the Taurus 09 deployment under Commander UK Amphibious Task Group, Commodore Peter Hudson, She was joined on this deployment by Landing Platform Dock , as Hudson&#x27;s flagship, Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH) , Type 23 frigate and four ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. &quot;Argyll&quot; returned to Devonport on 17 April from this deployment.

In early October 2010, &quot;Argyll&quot; and her crew arrived in Plymouth last week after an 11-month refit which included 290,000-man-hours spent on modifications, upgrades and improvements.&quot; She has received a new command system, upgrades to Sea Wolf, the Mod1 4.5-inch (114mm) gun, and mounts for new small calibre guns. She was also given new boat-launching equipment. &quot;The refit included the replacing of two of the vessel&#x27;s four diesel generators and one of her gas turbine engines.&quot; Her ventilation system has been improved. &quot;Along with fresh paint on the upper decks she has been coated below the waterline with a special paint to prevent the build-up of sea life which would slow the ship. This also makes her more fuel-efficient.&quot; HMS &quot;Argyll&quot; was the first Type 23 frigate to undergo a second major refit.

===2011–2021===

On Sunday 22 January 2012 it was announced that &quot;Argyll&quot; was part of a six-ship convoy which sailed through the Strait of Hormuz alongside French and United States Navy vessels, during a diplomatic dispute with Iran. In a period after this she engaged in Exercise &#x27;Goalkeeper&#x27; whilst still in the Middle East.

On 30 June 2012, Armed Forces Day, she fired the salute in Plymouth as part of a steampast alongside , the Earl of Wessex was in attendance alongside the First Sea Lord.

In 2013, she served a seven-month deployment to the Atlantic, having visited South Africa. She also engaged in counter-narcotics work in the Eastern Pacific by travelling around Cape Horn and headed back to her home port via the Panama Canal.

In March 2014, she accidentally fired a test (unarmed) torpedo whilst training at Devonport, there were no injuries and minimal damage.

On 30 June 2014, she arrived in Hamilton, Bermuda for a three-day visit as part of her deployment to the North Atlantic and Caribbean.

She arrived in Baltimore, Maryland, US on 11 September 2014 to participate in ceremonies commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Star Spangled Banner.

On 25 September 2014, she arrived in Veracruz.

On 6 October 2014, HMS &quot;Argyll&quot; visited George Town, Grand Cayman, after having been on counter-narcotics deployment in August 2014 as part of Operation Martillo.
From 9 to 13 October 2014 HMS &quot;Argyll&quot; paid an official visit to the Dominican Republic during the course of which her flight deck hosted the baptism of Stefania Rozsa, daughter of the British Ambassador.
On 18 October 2014, she arrived in Bermuda to provide assistance in the aftermath of Hurricane Gonzalo.

In 2014, a Lynx from &quot;Argyll&quot; identified a suspicious yacht in the Caribbean Sea, and a detachment of the U.S. Coast Guard operating from &quot;Argyll&quot; seized $16 million worth of cocaine found on the yacht. The group had seized an even larger shipment earlier on the same deployment.

In 2015, &quot;Argyll&quot; underwent an extended Life Extension (LIFEX) refit in Devonport; she returned to sea in February 2017 with a new principal weapon system, Sea Ceptor, and numerous modifications and alterations to her accommodation and working spaces. &quot;Argyll&quot; acted as the trials vessel for Sea Ceptor prior to resuming her operational duties and it was announced in September 2017 that she had undertaken the first firings of the new system earlier in the summer off the west coast of Scotland.

In 2017, it was announced that &quot;Argyll&quot; would be sent to join military exercises in the Asia Pacific with the Five Power Defence Arrangements partners and also the Japanese Maritime Self Defence Force. Part of her mission is &quot;to continue the pressure campaign on North Korea&quot;.

On 11 March 2019, &quot;Argyll&quot; rescued a 27-strong crew from a burning container vessel Grande America 150 miles off the coast of France.

On 15 March 2019 the ship returned to HMNB Devonport after a nine-month deployment to Southeast Asia.

On 11 September 2019 it demonstrated the use of an autonomous PAC24 unmanned surface vehicle, a modified version of the boat the ship already carries, at the Defence and Security Equipment International 2019 exhibition. Also involved in the demonstration was an additional autonomous boat: the MAST-13.

In December 2020, the ship visited Egypt to allow for strategic talks between British First Sea Lord Admiral Tony Radakin and Egyptian Admiral Ahmed Khaled Hassan Saeed. The ship took part in joint-exercises between Egypt and the UK.

===2022–present===
In May 2022, &quot;Argyll&quot; became the first Type 23 to have undergone a LIFEX refit to undergo a subsequent major upkeep period, which saw the ship dry-docked for an extended period to enable it to be retained in service until around 2027-28, when it was intended to be replaced by either or . In response to questions posed in Parliament, the Minister of State at the MoD, James Cartlidge, could not confirm that HMS &quot;Argyll&quot; would remain in service. In May 2024, it was confirmed that the frigate would be retired and sold to BAE Systems to support apprentice training.

In 2022, &quot;Argyll&quot; spent just 21 days at sea.

&quot;Argyll&quot; had been scheduled to be withdrawn from service in 2023. However, in 2021 in a written answer provided to the House of Commons Select Defence Committee, the First Sea Lord, Admiral Tony Radakin, suggested that older Type 23 frigates would be retained in service longer than anticipated in order to ensure that total escort numbers did not fall below 17 ships (6 destroyers and 11 frigates) and start to rise above 19 escorts starting in 2026. This would have required &quot;Argyll&quot; to have been kept in service significantly longer than anticipated.

However in May 2024, it was indicated that she would be retired and sold to BAE Systems for apprentice training instead. This occurred despite the fact that in May 2022 she began an 18-month refit with the intent of extending her service life until about 2027-28.

<doc id="450056" wikidata="Q204993" url="?curid=450056" title="Yakima SunKings">
<text>The Yakima SunKings were a basketball team located in Yakima, Washington, covering the central Washington sports market of Yakima, Tri-Cities, and Ellensburg and plays at the Yakima SunDome. The team competed in the Continental Basketball Association from 1990 to 2008. In June 2005, the team was purchased by the Yakama Indian Nation and was renamed the Yakama Sun Kings (from Yakima to Yakama) to honor the Nation.

In 2018, a new version of the team was launched in North American Premier Basketball, which then rebranded as The Basketball League in 2019. The team won the regular season title in both seasons and won the playoff championship in 2018. The league lost western teams prior to the 2020 season and the new SunKings decided against participation in the league.

==History==
The franchise started in Kansas City, Missouri, then moved to Topeka, Kansas, and the Pacific Northwest. In 1990, the team was purchased by Sacramento attorney Robert Wilson and was led By GM Brooks Ellison. Ex-Major League Baseball Player Ted Bowesfield was hired as an adviser. Dianne LaBissionaire, Pat Beehler, and Jay Mahn conducted day-to-day operations. A local contest to select a name was held, and the Yakima Sun Kings was chosen, replacing the old name, &quot;Sizzlers&quot;. The team hired local favorite Dean Nicholson as coach. Dennis Rahm became the play by play radio announcer and handled media releases.

The Sun Kings was the first team to show a profit in the history of the CBA. The team was fairly successful historically, given the inconsistent nature of minor-league basketball; they won the 1994–95, 1999–2000, 2002–03, 2005–06 and 2006-07 CBA championships. The Sun Kings had a disappointing 2003–04 season when they posted a 10–38 record. They were also 0–9 against the CBA Champion Dakota Wizards.

Ronny Turiaf, a draft pick of the Los Angeles Lakers in 2005, played nine games for the Sun Kings in the 2005–06 season, less than six months after undergoing open-heart surgery which caused the Lakers to void his contract. He averaged 13 points in nine games with the team before re-signing with the Lakers in January 2006.

The Sun Kings won their fourth CBA Championship with a 111–101 victory in Game 3 of a best-of-3 finals series against the Gary Steelheads on March 27, 2006.

In 2006–07 the Sun Kings repeated as champions, sweeping the Albany Patroons three games to none.

On April 10, 2008, the Yakama Nation shut down team operations due to financial losses.

On September 29, 2017, it was announced that the Yakima SunKings would be one of the founding franchises of the North American Premier Basketball. In October 2017, Paul Woolpert was rehired as its head coach and general manager. The team won the inaugural championship. The league became The Basketball League in 2019 and Woolpert left the team. The SunKings then removed itself from the league before the 2020 season as most of the western teams had folded.

<doc id="450058" wikidata="Q3286988" url="?curid=450058" title="President of Mauritius">
<text>The president of the Republic of Mauritius () is the head of state of the Republic of Mauritius. Mauritius is a parliamentary republic, and the president functions as a ceremonial figurehead, elected by the National Assembly as set out by the Constitution of Mauritius. The current office-holder is Dharam Gokhool. He was elected by the National Assembly on 6 December 2024. The president&#x27;s official residence is the State House.

==Overview==
Mauritius is a parliamentary republic. The prime minister is the head of government, while the president is the head of state and commander-in-chief. The president is required to uphold and defend the Constitution of Mauritius and ensure that the institutions of democracy and rule of law are protected, the fundamental rights of all are respected and the unity of the diverse Mauritian nation is maintained and strengthened. Whilst in office, the president should not hold any other office of emolument, whether under the Constitution or otherwise and exercise any profession or calling or engage in any trade or business.

The president is obliged to suspend his (or her) membership in any political party for the term in office. Upon assuming office, the authority and duties of the president in all other elected or appointed offices terminate automatically. These measures should theoretically help the president to function in a more independent and impartial manner.

The power of Parliament to make laws shall be exercisable by bills passed by the Assembly and assented to by the president. When a bill is submitted to the president for assent by the Constitution, he shall signify that he assents or that he withholds assent. In the exercise of his functions, the president shall act by the advice of the Cabinet or of a minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet except in cases where he is required by the Constitution to act by the advice of, or after consultation with, any person or authority other than the Cabinet or in his deliberate judgment.

According to Chapter VI, section 58 of the constitution executive authority of Mauritius is vested in the president, and that authority may be exercised by the president either directly or through officers subordinate to him.

The prime minister shall keep the President fully informed concerning the general conduct of the government of Mauritius and shall furnish the president with such information as he may request concerning any particular matter relating to the government of Mauritius.

The president serves as chancellor of the Order of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean, the highest distinct order of merit of Mauritius. The president, on the recommendation of the prime minister, announces the list of honorees and personally decorates them. The ceremony is held on 12 March each year.

The office of the president has the mission to assist the president of the Republic in his duties to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and promote national unity.

The president makes a number of important public speeches and statements each year. The most notable of these are the annual New Year’s Speech on 1 January, and the speech at the opening of each annual session of Parliament.

==Historical background==


The office of president was created on 12 March 1992 after Mauritius became a republic, 24 years to the day after it had gained independence. It replaced the office of governor general which was representative of the Queen of Mauritius, Elizabeth II. The office of governor-general was occupied by Sir Dayandranath Burrenchobay, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam and Sir Veerasamy Ringadoo was governor-general from 1986 to 11 March 1992, he became the first president of the republic on 12 March 1992 and left office on 30 June 1992. Cassam Uteem was elected as the president in 1992 and 1997, he held office from 30 June 1992 and resigned on 15 February 2002 in protest at a controversial anti-terrorism bill which the government wanted signed into law. Angidi Chettiar who was the vice president of Mauritius held the office as acting president on 15 February 2002, he resigned after two days. Ariranga Pillay became acting president from 18 February 2002 to 25 February 2002. Karl Offmann was elected in 2002, he held office from 25 February 2002 and resigned on 1 October 2003. Raouf Bundhun became acting president from 1 October 2003 to 7 October 2003.

Sir Anerood Jugnauth was elected in 2003. Taking office on 7 October 2003, he was re-elected in 2008. In March 2012, Sir Anerood criticised the government, saying that the economy had entered a vicious circle of economic loss and the population was suffering. The prime minister Navin Ramgoolam said that the presidency was an apolitical office and invited him to join the political arena. SAJ resigned on 31 March 2012 and made his comeback in politics, he took the lead of his former party Militant Socialist Movement (MSM) which just break it alliance with the Labour party and left the government because of corruption accusation, the Medpoint Scandal. After the return of Sir Anerood, the MSM concluded an alliance with the opposition party Mauritian Militant Movement.

Monique Ohsan Bellepeau The then–vice president acted as president from 31 March 2012 to 21 July 2012. Kailash Purryag was elected as the fifth president of Mauritius by members of the National Assembly on Friday 20 July.

Monique Ohsan Bellepeau again acted as president from 1 June 2015 to 5 June 2015 prior to the inauguration of Ameenah Gurib-Fakim. She is the first woman to ever hold the title of &quot;president of Mauritius&quot;. Her ascendancy to the presidency was facilitated by a constitutional conundrum that had gripped Mauritius since Alliance L’Avenir came to power in 2010. In 2014, the Alliance L’Avenir entered into an agreement with the Alliance L’Avenir on the basis of constitutional reform which would have seen Mauritius turning into a semi-presidential state where the president would be conferred the power of dissolution, having a direct role in shaping foreign policy and, chairing government meetings. In December 2014, voters rejected the proposals to give the president greater powers.

<doc id="450062" wikidata="Q2528185" url="?curid=450062" title="Subgraph isomorphism problem">
<text>In theoretical computer science, the subgraph isomorphism problem is a computational task in which two graphs formula_1 and formula_2 are given as input, and one must determine whether formula_1 contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to formula_2.
Subgraph isomorphism is a generalization of both the maximum clique problem and the problem of testing whether a graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle, and is therefore NP-complete. However certain other cases of subgraph isomorphism may be solved in polynomial time.

Sometimes the name subgraph matching is also used for the same problem. This name puts emphasis on finding such a subgraph as opposed to the bare decision problem.

==Decision problem and computational complexity==

To prove subgraph isomorphism is NP-complete, it must be formulated as a decision problem. The input to the decision problem is a pair of graphs formula_1 and &quot;H&quot;. The answer to the problem is positive if &quot;H&quot; is isomorphic to a subgraph of &quot;G&quot;, and negative otherwise.

Formal question:

Let formula_6, formula_7 be graphs. Is there a subgraph formula_8 such that formula_9? I. e., does there exist a bijection formula_10 such that formula_11?

The proof of subgraph isomorphism being NP-complete is simple and based on reduction of the clique problem, an NP-complete decision problem in which the input is a single graph &quot;G&quot; and a number &quot;k&quot;, and the question is whether &quot;G&quot; contains a complete subgraph with &quot;k&quot; vertices. To translate this to a subgraph isomorphism problem, simply let &quot;H&quot; be the complete graph &quot;K&quot;&quot;k&quot;; then the answer to the subgraph isomorphism problem for &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; is equal to the answer to the clique problem for &quot;G&quot; and &quot;k&quot;. Since the clique problem is NP-complete, this polynomial-time many-one reduction shows that subgraph isomorphism is also NP-complete.

An alternative reduction from the Hamiltonian cycle problem translates a graph &quot;G&quot; which is to be tested for Hamiltonicity into the pair of graphs &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot;, where &quot;H&quot; is a cycle having the same number of vertices as &quot;G&quot;. Because the Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete even for planar graphs, this shows that subgraph isomorphism remains NP-complete even in the planar case.

Subgraph isomorphism is a generalization of the graph isomorphism problem, which asks whether &quot;G&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;H&quot;: the answer to the graph isomorphism problem is true if and only if &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; both have the same numbers of vertices and edges and the subgraph isomorphism problem for &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; is true. However the complexity-theoretic status of graph isomorphism remains an open question.

In the context of the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture on the query complexity of monotone graph properties, showed that any subgraph isomorphism problem has query complexity Ω(&quot;n&quot;3/2); that is, solving the subgraph isomorphism requires an algorithm to check the presence or absence in the input of Ω(&quot;n&quot;3/2) different edges in the graph.

==Algorithms==
 describes a recursive backtracking procedure for solving the subgraph isomorphism problem. Although its running time is, in general, exponential, it takes polynomial time for any fixed choice of &quot;H&quot; (with a polynomial that depends on the choice of &quot;H&quot;). When &quot;G&quot; is a planar graph (or more generally a graph of bounded expansion) and &quot;H&quot; is fixed, the running time of subgraph isomorphism can be reduced to linear time.

 is a substantial update to the 1976 subgraph isomorphism algorithm paper.

 proposed in 2004 another algorithm based on Ullmann&#x27;s, VF2, which improves the refinement process using different heuristics and uses significantly less memory.

 proposed a better algorithm, which improves the initial order of the vertices using some heuristics.

The current state of the art solver for moderately-sized, hard instances is the Glasgow Subgraph Solver (). This solver adopts a constraint programming approach, using bit-parallel data structures and specialized propagation algorithms for performance. It supports most common variations of the problem and is capable of counting or enumerating solutions as well as deciding whether one exists.

For large graphs, state-of-the art algorithms include CFL-Match and Turboiso, and extensions thereupon such as DAF by .

==Applications==
As subgraph isomorphism has been applied in the area of cheminformatics to find similarities between chemical compounds from their structural formula; often in this area the term substructure search is used. A query structure is often defined graphically using a structure editor program; SMILES based database systems typically define queries using SMARTS, a SMILES extension.

The closely related problem of counting the number of isomorphic copies of a graph &quot;H&quot; in a larger graph &quot;G&quot; has been applied to pattern discovery in databases, the bioinformatics of protein-protein interaction networks, and in exponential random graph methods for mathematically modeling social networks.

 describe an application of subgraph isomorphism in the computer-aided design of electronic circuits. Subgraph matching is also a substep in graph rewriting (the most runtime-intensive), and thus offered by graph rewrite tools.

The problem is also of interest in artificial intelligence, where it is considered part of an array of pattern matching in graphs problems; an extension of subgraph isomorphism known as graph mining is also of interest in that area.

<text>Colleen Ann Fitzpatrick (born July 20, 1969), known professionally as Vitamin C, is an American record executive, singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. She began her career as an Ivory soap baby and child actress, appearing in John Waters&#x27; film &quot;Hairspray&quot; (1988), and continued to appear in minor roles in films before launching a music career with the alternative rock band Eve&#x27;s Plum in 1991.

In 1999, under the stage name Vitamin C, Fitzpatrick embarked on a solo career, releasing her eponymous debut album &quot;Vitamin C&quot; (1999), which was certified Platinum by the RIAA. Singles from the record include &quot;Graduation (Friends Forever)&quot; and the Top 20 single &quot;Smile&quot;. Her second album, &quot;More&quot; (2001) spawned the singles &quot;As Long as You&#x27;re Loving Me&quot; and &quot;The Itch&quot;.

She appeared in the horror film &quot;Dracula 2000&quot; (2000), and made cameo appearances in &quot;Get Over It&quot; (2001) and &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot; (2001). She also appeared as a panelist on the spoof talent series The WB&#x27;s &quot;Superstar USA&quot; in 2004. She was ranked No. 76 on the &quot;Maxim&quot; Hot 100 Women of 2001.

In March 2012, Fitzpatrick was appointed as Vice President of Music at Nickelodeon. Since early 2019, Fitzpatrick has served as a music executive for Netflix.

==Early life==
Fitzpatrick was born in Old Bridge, New Jersey, on July 20, 1969. She is the youngest of three children born to Vita, a legal secretary, and Gerard Fitzpatrick, a communications executive. She is of Irish descent. She graduated from Cedar Ridge High School in 1987 (now called Old Bridge High School), where she was a classmate of Junot Díaz. During her high school years she was a dancer who danced professionally in several TV ads, and also starred in her high school musical. She later attended New York University, graduating in 1991 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English.

== Career ==
===&quot;Hairspray&quot; and Eve&#x27;s Plum (1987–1997)===

In 1988, Fitzpatrick made her screen debut under her real name in the John Waters feature film &quot;Hairspray&quot; as Amber Von Tussle, the bratty on-screen daughter of co-stars Debbie Harry and Sonny Bono.

She made her first musical outing as the lead singer of the alternative rock band Eve&#x27;s Plum, named after &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; actress Eve Plumb, formed in 1991. She formed the band in 1991 with Michael Kotch, whom she met while studying at New York University. A year later the group signed a record deal with Epic Records in 1992, releasing two albums and seven singles between 1993 and 1995.

===&quot;Vitamin C&quot; and &quot;More&quot; (1998–2001)===
In 1998, Fitzpatrick launched a pop music solo project as &quot;Vitamin C&quot; and signed an album deal with Elektra Records. Released in 1999, her debut solo album &quot;Vitamin C&quot; peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 29 and was certified Platinum by the RIAA. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Smile&quot;, peaked at number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was certified Gold by the RIAA. The second single from the album, &quot;Me, Myself &amp; I&quot;, failed to chart. The third single &quot;Graduation (Friends Forever)&quot; was more successful, peaking at number 12 on the Top 40 Mainstream Chart and number 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In Australia, the song peaked at number 2 on the ARIA Charts and was certified Platinum. It peaked at number 4 in the Republic of Ireland. In 1999, she wrote and recorded &quot;Vacation&quot;, which became the opening theme to the short film &quot;Pikachu&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (from &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot;). Vitamin C&#x27;s cover version of the Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons song &quot;December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)&quot; was used in promotional material for the American television network The WB during the 1999–2000 television season. In 2000, Mattel produced a Vitamin C doll which was retailed at approximately $16, and a Vitamin C lipstick shade was made by Tommy Hilfiger.

In late 2000, Vitamin C released &quot;The Itch&quot;, the first single from her second album &quot;More&quot;. The song peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 45. &quot;The Itch&quot; had more success in Australia where it peaked at number 6 on the ARIA Charts and was certified Platinum. That year, she played the role of Lucy Westerman in the horror film &quot;Dracula 2000&quot; and appeared as herself in the spoof film &quot;Da Hip Hop Witch&quot;. &quot;More&quot; was released on January 31, 2001 and debuted at number 122 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;As Long As You&#x27;re Loving Me&quot; was released as the second single from the album, but failed to chart in the US. Subsequently, Vitamin C was dropped from Elektra Records.

In the February 2001 issue of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine, Vitamin C was voted as one of the &quot;Fun and Fearless Females&quot; of the year. That same year Vitamin C was ranked No. 76 on the &quot;Maxim&quot; Hot 100 Women of 2001. The 2001 video game &quot;EA Sports Triple Play&quot; featured Vitamin C as an animated baseball player.

===&quot;Last Nite&quot; and later activities (2002–2009)===
Vitamin C signed with V2 Records in 2001 and released the single &quot;Last Nite&quot; in July 2003. It was a cover version of the hit song by The Strokes and sampled Blondie&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;. The single failed to chart in the US, and peaked at number 70 on the UK Singles Chart.

In 2005, Vitamin C&#x27;s cover of &quot;Voices Carry&quot; by &#x27;Til Tuesday was included on the soundtrack for the Disney movie &quot;Sky High&quot;. The same year, she wrote the song &quot;We Are Gonna Happen&quot; for Emma Roberts on the &quot;Unfabulous and More&quot; album.

In 2006, she assembled a Radio Disney-aimed group of four teenagers named The Truth Squad. Vitamin C wrote and produced a number of song&#x27;s for the group&#x27;s debut album, which included a cover of &quot;Graduation (Friends Forever)&quot;. The album was released on April 3, 2007, and made a brief appearance on the Top Kid Audio Chart, where it peaked at No. 23. During this time, Vitamin C was reportedly working on two new albums, a children&#x27;s world-music album and a pop album, neither of which were released.

In 2006, Fitzpatrick created a production company and worked with various pop singers such as Miley Cyrus. In 2008, she wrote the single &quot;Make Some Noise&quot; for Krystal Meyers. In 2009, she wrote &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Crazy&quot; for Miley Cyrus as Hannah Montana. Vitamin C also wrote the song &quot;One and the Same&quot;, a duet recorded by Demi Lovato and Selena Gomez for the Disney Channel Original Movie &quot;Princess Protection Program&quot;.

=== Music executive (2012–present) ===
On March 21, 2012, Nickelodeon named Fitzpatrick as VP of Music. She oversaw all music for Nickelodeon and its sister cable channels. In 2016, she appeared as a featured artist on Information Society&#x27;s cover of &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot;; her vocals on the release were recorded in 2001.

In 2019, she joined Netflix as an executive in charge of &quot;music creative production, spectacle and events&quot;. In December 2020, Fitzpatrick released a rerecorded and rewritten version of &quot;Graduation&quot; titled &quot;Graduation 2020 (Worst Year Ever)&quot;, with the lyrics changed to reflect on life during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="450068" wikidata="Q802062" url="?curid=450068" title="Dalton Highway">
<text>The James W. Dalton Highway, usually referred to as the Dalton Highway (and signed as Alaska Route 11), is a road in Alaska. It begins at the Elliott Highway, north of Fairbanks, and ends at Deadhorse (an unincorporated community within the CDP of Prudhoe Bay) near the Arctic Ocean and the Prudhoe Bay Oil Fields. Once called the North Slope Haul Road (a name by which it is still sometimes known), it was built as a supply road to support the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System in 1974. It is named after James Dalton, a lifelong Alaskan and an engineer served as a consultant in early oil exploration in northern Alaska. It is also the subject of the second episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Toughest Jobs&quot;, seasons 3 and 4 of &quot;Ice Road Truckers&quot; and the first episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Roads&quot;. The road is about one-quarter paved and three-quarters gravel.

==History==
In 1966, Governor Walter J. Hickel opened the North Slope to oil extraction. To improve access to the oil fields, a winter road was planned between Livengood and Prudhoe Bay. Construction started in November 1968, and the &quot;Walter J. Hickel Highway&quot; was completed by March 1969. Due to poor engineering, the construction of the road exposed the underlying permafrost to thawing, and the road was abandoned by April of that year. Maintenance was not performed as the route was farther west than the planned Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.

Following the failure of the Hickel Highway, oil companies still needed a route to the North Slope. The Alyeska Pipeline Service Company funded what would be the first stretch of the Dalton Highway from Livengood to the Yukon River in 1969. 

Delays to the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, and therefore the road, meant that work on it did not resume until April 29, 1974. Within 5 months, of the road were built and construction was finished. The pipeline would not be completed until 1977. It was initially known as the &quot;Wales Highway&quot;.

In 1979, Alyeska turned over control of the road to the state of Alaska, who gave it the official name of &quot;James W. Dalton Highway&quot;, named after the prospector of the North Slope, James W. Dalton. In 1981, the highway was opened to the public up to Disaster Creek at mile 211. In 1994, the public was allowed access to the entire length of the highway.

==Route description==
The highway, which directly parallels the pipeline, is one of the most isolated roads in the United States. There are only three towns along the route: Coldfoot (pop. 34) at Mile 175, Wiseman (pop. 12) at Mile 188, and Deadhorse (25 permanent residents, 3,500–5,000 or more seasonal residents depending on oil production) at the end of the highway at Mile 414. Fuel is available at the E. L. Patton Yukon River Bridge (Mile 56), as well as Coldfoot and Deadhorse. Two other settlements, Prospect Creek and Galbraith Lake, are uninhabited except for campers and other short-term residents.

Despite its remoteness, the Dalton Highway carries a good amount of truck traffic through to Prudhoe Bay: about 160 trucks daily in the summer months and 250 trucks daily in the winter. 

, of the highway are paved, in several sections, between the following mileages: 19 and 24; 37 and 50; 91 and 111; 113 and 197; 257 and 261; 344 and 352; and 356 and 361.

Truckers on the Dalton have given their own names to its various features, including: Taps, The Shelf, Franklin Bluffs, Oil Spill Hill, Beaver Slide, Surprise Rise, Sand Hill, Ice Cut, Gobbler&#x27;s Knob, Finger Mountain, Oh Shit Corner, and the Roller Coaster. The road reaches its highest elevation as it crosses the Brooks Range at Atigun Pass at .

The highway is the featured road on the second (episode 7), third, fourth, fifth and sixth seasons of the History reality television series &quot;Ice Road Truckers&quot;, which aired May 31, 2009, to November 9, 2017. It is also the subject of the second episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Toughest Jobs&quot; and the first episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Roads&quot; featuring Charley Boorman and Sue Perkins. Polar bears are known to traverse the Arctic region of Alaska and can be seen wandering the outskirts of Deadhorse at the terminus of the Dalton Highway.

Floodings of the Sagavanirktok River, combined with melting of nearby ice roads under warmer climatic conditions have forced weeks-long closures of the road and the need for significant repairs, costing several million US dollars. 

In 2018, a section of the Dalton was moved to avoid a debris flow known as &quot;the blob.&quot; A roughly long lobe of dirt, ice, and trees, the blob threatened to bulldoze the section of the road north of Fairbanks in the next three or four years at a speed of per year. It will likely have to be moved again in the next 20 years before the blob can threaten it again. Truckers were directed to a new gravel road that avoided the landslide.

<text>The Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket (or D-558-II) is a rocket and jet-powered research supersonic aircraft built by the Douglas Aircraft Company for the United States Navy. On 20 November 1953, shortly before the (17 December) 50th anniversary of powered flight, Scott Crossfield piloted the Skyrocket to Mach 2, or more than 1,290 mph (2076 km/h), the first time an aircraft had exceeded twice the speed of sound.

==Design and development==
The &quot;-2&quot; in the aircraft&#x27;s designation referred to the fact that the Skyrocket was the phase-two version of what had originally been conceived as a three-phase program. The phase-one aircraft, the D-558-1, was jet powered and had straight wings. The third phase, which never came to fruition, would have involved constructing a mock-up of a combat type aircraft embodying the results from the testing of the phase one and two aircraft. The eventual D-558-3 design, which was never built, was for a hypersonic aircraft similar to the North American X-15.

When it became obvious that the D558-1 fuselage could not be modified to accommodate both rocket and jet power, the D558-2 was conceived as an entirely different aircraft. The supply contract was changed on January 27, 1947 to drop the final three D558-1 aircraft and substitute three new D558-2 aircraft.

The Skyrocket featured wings with a 35-degree sweep and horizontal stabilizers with 40-degree sweep. The wings and empennage were fabricated from aluminum and the large fuselage was primarily magnesium. The Skyrocket was powered by a Westinghouse J34-40 turbojet engine having 3,000 lbf (13 kN) thrust fed through side intakes in the forward fuselage. This engine was intended for takeoff, climb and landing. For high speed flight, a four-chamber Reaction Motors LR8-RM-6 engine (the Navy designation for the Air Force&#x27;s XLR11 used in the Bell X-1), was fitted. This engine was rated at 6,000 lbf (27 kN) static thrust at sea level. A total of of aviation fuel, of alcohol, and of liquid oxygen were carried in fuselage tanks.

The Skyrocket originally had a flush cockpit canopy, but visibility from the cockpit was poor, so it was re-configured with a raised cockpit with conventional angled windows. This resulted in a larger profile area at the front of the aircraft, which was balanced by an additional 14 inches (36 cm) of height added to the vertical stabilizer. Like its predecessor, the D558-1, the D558-2 was designed so that the forward fuselage, including cockpit, could disconnect from the rest of the aircraft in an emergency. Once the forward fuselage had slowed down, the pilot could escape from the cockpit by parachute.

==Operational history==
Douglas pilot John F. Martin made the first flight at Muroc Army Airfield (later renamed Edwards Air Force Base) in California on 4 February 1948 in an aircraft equipped only with the jet engine. The goals of the program were to investigate the characteristics of swept-wing aircraft at transonic and supersonic speeds with particular attention to pitch-up (un-commanded rotation of the nose of the aircraft upwards), a problem prevalent in high-speed service aircraft of that era, particularly at low speeds during takeoff and landing, and in tight turns.

The three aircraft gathered a great deal of data about pitch-up and the coupling of lateral (yaw) and longitudinal (pitch) motions; wing and tail loads, lift, drag and buffeting characteristics of swept-wing aircraft at transonic and supersonic speeds; and the effects of the rocket exhaust plume on lateral dynamic stability throughout the speed range. (Plume effects were a new experience for aircraft.) The number three aircraft also gathered information about the effects of external stores (bomb shapes, drop tanks) upon the aircraft&#x27;s behavior in the transonic region (roughly 0.7 to 1.3 times the speed of sound). In correlation with data from other early transonic research aircraft such as the XF-92A, this information contributed to solutions to the pitch-up problem in swept-wing aircraft.

Its flight research was done at the NACA&#x27;s Muroc Flight Test Unit in California, redesignated in 1949 the High-Speed Flight Research Station (HSFRS). The HSFRS became the High-Speed Flight Station in 1954 and was then known as the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. In 2014 it was renamed Armstrong Flight Research Center in honor of Neil Armstrong.


The three aircraft flew a total of 313 times – 123 by the number one aircraft (Bureau No. 37973—NACA 143), 103 by the second Skyrocket (Bureau No. 37974 – NACA 144), and 87 by aircraft number three (Bureau No. 37975 – NACA 145). Skyrocket 143 flew all but one of its missions as part of the Douglas contractor program to test the aircraft&#x27;s performance.

NACA aircraft 143 was initially powered by the jet engine only, but was later fitted with the rocket engine. In this configuration, it was tested by Douglas from 1949 to 1951. After Douglas&#x27; test program, it was delivered to NACA, who stored it until 1954. In 1954–55 the contractor modified it to an all-rocket air-launch capability with the jet engine removed. In this configuration, NACA research pilot John McKay flew the aircraft only once for familiarization on 17 September 1956. The 123 flights of NACA 143 served to validate wind-tunnel predictions of the aircraft&#x27;s performance, except for the fact that the aircraft experienced less drag above Mach 0.85 than the wind tunnels had indicated.

NACA 144 also began its flight program with a turbojet powerplant. NACA pilots Robert A. Champine and John H. Griffith flew 21 times in this configuration to test airspeed calibrations and to research longitudinal and lateral stability and control. In the process, during August 1949 they encountered pitch-up problems, which NACA engineers recognized as serious because they could produce a limiting and dangerous restriction on flight performance. Hence, they determined to make a complete investigation of the problem.

In 1950, Douglas replaced the turbojet with an LR-8 rocket engine, and its pilot, Bill Bridgeman, flew the aircraft seven times up to a speed of Mach 1.88 (1.88 times the speed of sound) and an altitude of 79,494 ft (24,230 m), the latter an unofficial world&#x27;s altitude record at the time, achieved on 15 August 1951. In the rocket configuration, the aircraft was attached beneath the bomb bay of a Navy P2B, a variant of the B-29 bomber. The P2B would fly to about , then release the rocket plane. During Bridgeman&#x27;s supersonic flights, he encountered a violent rolling motion known as lateral instability. The motion was less pronounced during the Mach 1.88 flight on 7 August 1951 than during a Mach 1.85 flight in June when he pushed over to a low angle of attack.

The NACA engineers studied the behavior of the aircraft before beginning their own flight research in the aircraft in September 1951. Over the next couple of years, NACA pilot Scott Crossfield flew the aircraft 20 times to gather data on longitudinal and lateral stability and control, wing and tail loads, and lift, drag, and buffeting characteristics at speeds up to Mach 1.878.

At that point, Marine Lt. Col. Marion Carl flew the aircraft to a new (unofficial) altitude record of 83,235 feet (25,370 m) on 21 August 1953, and to a maximum speed of Mach 1.728. The altitude record was not recognized by the Federation of Aeronautique Internationale, because at that time aircraft making record attempts had to take off on their own power.

Following Carl&#x27;s completion of these flights for the Navy, NACA technicians at the High-Speed Flight Research Station (HSFRS) near Mojave, California, outfitted the LR-8 engine&#x27;s combustion chambers with nozzle extensions to prevent the exhaust gas from affecting the rudders at supersonic speeds. This addition also increased the engine&#x27;s thrust by 6.5 percent at Mach 1.7 and 70,000 feet (21,300 m).

Even before Marion Carl had flown the Skyrocket, HSFRS Chief Walter C. Williams had petitioned NACA headquarters unsuccessfully to fly the aircraft to Mach 2 to garner the research data at that speed. Finally, after Crossfield had secured the agreement of the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Aeronautics, NACA director Hugh L. Dryden relaxed the organization&#x27;s usual practice of leaving record setting to others and consented to attempting a flight to Mach 2.

In addition to adding the nozzle extensions, the NACA flight team at the HSFRS chilled the fuel (alcohol) so more could be poured into the tank and waxed the fuselage to reduce drag. Project engineer Herman O. Ankenbruck drew up a plan to fly to about 72,000 feet (21,900 m) and push over into a slight dive. Crossfield made aviation history on 20 November 1953, when he flew to Mach 2.005, 1,291 miles per hour (2,078 km/h). It was the only Mach 2 flight the Skyrocket ever made.

Following this flight, Crossfield and NACA pilots Joseph A. Walker and John B. McKay flew the aircraft for such purposes as to gather data on pressure distribution, structural loads, and structural heating, with the last flight in the program occurring on 20 December 1956, when McKay obtained dynamic stability data and sound-pressure levels at transonic speeds and above.

Meanwhile, NACA 145 had completed 21 contractor flights by Douglas pilots Eugene F. May and William Bridgeman in November 1950. In this jet-and-rocket-propelled craft, Scott Crossfield and Walter Jones began the NACA&#x27;s investigation of pitch-up lasting from September 1951 well into summer 1953. They flew the Skyrocket with a variety of wing-fence, wing-slat and leading edge chord extension configurations, performing various maneuvers as well as straight-and-level flying at transonic speeds. While fences significantly aided recovery from pitch-up conditions, leading edge chord extensions did not, disproving wind-tunnel tests to the contrary. Slats (long, narrow auxiliary airfoils) in the fully open position eliminated pitch-up except in the speed range around Mach 0.8 to 0.85.

In June 1954, Crossfield began an investigation of the effects of external stores (bomb shapes and fuel tanks) upon the aircraft&#x27;s transonic behavior. McKay and Stanley Butchart completed the NACA&#x27;s investigation of this issue, with McKay flying the final mission on 28 August 1956.

Besides setting several records, the Skyrocket pilots had gathered important data and understanding about what would and would not work to provide stable, controlled flight of a swept-wing aircraft in the transonic and supersonic flight regimes. The data they gathered also helped to enable a better correlation of wind-tunnel test results with actual flight values, enhancing the abilities of designers to produce more capable aircraft for the armed services, especially those with swept wings. Moreover, data on such matters as stability and control from this and other early research aircraft aided in the design of the Century Series of fighter aircraft, all of which featured the movable horizontal stabilizers first employed on the X-1 and D-558 series.

==Variants==
All three of the Skyrockets had 35-degree swept wings.

Until configured for air launch, NACA 143 featured a Westinghouse J-34-40 turbojet engine rated at static thrust. It carried of aviation gasoline and weighed 10,572 lb (4,795 kg) at takeoff.

NACA 144 (and NACA 143 after modification in 1955) was powered by an LR-8-RM-6 rocket engine rated at static thrust. Its propellants were of liquid oxygen and of diluted ethyl alcohol. In its launch configuration, it weighed 15,787 lb (7,161 kg).

NACA 145 had both an LR-8-RM-5 rocket engine rated at static thrust and featured a Westinghouse J-34-40 turbojet engine rated at static thrust. It carried of liquid oxygen, of diluted ethyl alcohol, and of aviation gasoline for a launch weight of 15,266 lb (6,925 kg).

<text>Dolby Laboratories, Inc. (often shortened to Dolby Labs and known simply as Dolby) is a British-American technology corporation specializing in audio noise reduction, audio encoding/compression, spatial audio, and HDR imaging. Dolby licenses its technologies to consumer electronics manufacturers.

==History==
Dolby Labs was founded by Ray Dolby (1933–2013) in London, England, in 1965. In the same year, he invented the Dolby Noise Reduction system, a form of audio signal processing for reducing the background hissing sound on cassette tape recordings. His first U.S. patent on the technology was filed in 1969, four years later. The method was first used by Decca Records in the UK. After this, other companies began purchasing Dolby’s A301 technology, which was the professional noise reduction system used in recording, motion picture, broadcasting stations and communications networks. These companies include BBC, Pye, IBC, CBS Studios, RCA, and Granada.

He moved the company headquarters to the United States (San Francisco, California) in 1976. The first product Dolby Labs produced was the Dolby 301 unit which incorporated Type A Dolby Noise Reduction, a compander-based noise reduction system. These units were intended for use in professional recording studios.

Dolby was persuaded by Henry Kloss of KLH to manufacture a consumer version of his noise reduction. Dolby worked more on companding systems and introduced Type B in 1968.

Dolby also sought to improve film sound. As the corporation&#x27;s history explains:
:Upon investigation, Dolby found that many of the limitations in optical sound stemmed directly from its significantly high background noise. To filter this noise, the high-frequency response of theatre playback systems was deliberately curtailed… To make matters worse, to increase dialogue intelligibility over such systems, sound mixers were recording soundtracks with so much high-frequency pre-emphasis that high distortion resulted.

The first film with Dolby sound was &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971). The company was approached by Stanley Kubrick, who wanted to use Dolby’s noise reduction system to facilitate the film’s extensive mixing. The film went on to use Dolby noise reduction on all pre-mixes and masters, but a conventional optical soundtrack on release prints. &quot;Callan&quot; (1974) was the first film with a Dolby-encoded optical soundtrack. In 1975, Dolby released Dolby Stereo, which included a noise reduction system in addition to more audio channels (Dolby Stereo could actually contain additional center and surround channels matrixed from the left and right). The first film with a Dolby-encoded stereo optical soundtrack was &quot;Lisztomania&quot; (1975), although this only used an LCR (Left-Center-Right) encoding technique. The first true LCRS (Left-Center-Right-Surround) soundtrack was encoded on the movie &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; in 1976. In less than ten years, 6,000 cinemas worldwide were equipped to use Dolby Stereo sound. Dolby reworked the system slightly for home use and introduced Dolby Surround, which only extracted a surround channel, and the more impressive Dolby Pro Logic, which was the domestic equivalent of the theatrical Dolby Stereo. In 2005, Dolby&#x27;s stereo 4-channel optical theater surround was inducted into the TECnology Hall of Fame, an honor given to &quot;products and innovations that have had an enduring impact on the development of audio technology.&quot;

Dolby developed a digital surround sound compression scheme for the cinema. Dolby Stereo Digital (now simply called Dolby Digital) was first featured on the 1992 film &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. Introduced to the home theater market as Dolby AC-3 with the 1995 laserdisc release of &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;, the format did not become widespread in the consumer market, partly because of extra hardware that was necessary to make use of it, until it was adopted as part of the DVD specification. Dolby Digital is now found in the HDTV (ATSC) standard of the United States, DVD players, and many satellite-TV and cable-TV receivers.
Dolby developed a digital surround sound compression scheme for the TV series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

On February 17, 2005, the company became public, offering its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol DLB. On March 15, 2005, Dolby celebrated its 40th anniversary at the ShoWest 2005 Festival in San Francisco.

On January 8, 2007, Dolby announced the arrival of Dolby Volume at the International Consumer Electronics Show.

On June 18, 2010, Dolby introduced Dolby Surround 7.1, and set up theaters worldwide with 7.1 surround speaker setups to deliver theatrical 7.1 surround sound. The first film to be released with this format was Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; which was later followed by fifty releases using the format. About 80% of films released are now mixed in Dolby Surround 7.1 by default.

In April 2012, Dolby introduced its Dolby Atmos, a new cinematic technology adding overhead sound, first applied in Pixar&#x27;s motion picture &quot;Brave&quot;. In July 2014, Dolby Laboratories announced plans to bring Atmos to home theater. The first television show to use the technology on disc was &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

On February 24, 2014, Dolby acquired Doremi Labs for $92.5 million in cash plus an additional $20 million in contingent consideration that may be earned over a four-year period.

In May 2015, Dolby reopened Vine Theatre as a 70-seat showcase theater, known as Dolby @ Vine or Dolby Screening Room Hollywood Vine.

In May 2019, Dolby added Dolby Atmos to hundreds of newer songs in the music industry.

In May 2020, Dolby launched a developer platform, Dolby.io, aimed at providing developers self-service access to Dolby technologies through public APIs. It allows any person, organization, small and big, to integrate in their websites, apps, games, etc. features such as media enhancements and transcoding, spatial audio, high-quality video communication and low-latency streaming.

==Technologies==

===Analog audio noise reduction===
* Dolby A: professional noise reduction systems for analog reel-to-reel tape and cassettes.
* Dolby NR/B/C/S: consumer noise reduction systems for tapes and analog cassettes.
* Dolby SR (Spectral Recording): professional four-channel noise reduction system in use since 1986, which improves the dynamic range of analog recordings and transmissions by as much as 25 dB. Dolby SR is utilized by recording and post-production engineers, broadcasters, and other audio professionals. It is also the benchmark in analog film sound, being included today on nearly all 35 mm film prints. On films with digital soundtracks, the SR track is used in cinemas not equipped for digital playback, and it serves as a backup in case of problems with the digital track.
* Dolby FM: noise reduction system for FM broadcast radio. Dolby FM was tried by a few radio stations starting with WFMT in 1971. It used Dolby B, combined with 25 microsecond pre-emphasis. A small number of models of tuners and receivers were offered with the necessary decoder built in. In addition, a few cassette deck models appeared that allowed the deck&#x27;s internal Dolby B decoder to be put in the line level &quot;pass-through&quot; path, permitting its use with Dolby FM broadcasts. The system was not successful and was on the decline by 1974.
* Dolby HX Pro: single-ended system used on high-end tape recorders to increase headroom. The recording bias is lowered as the high-frequency component of the signal being recorded increases, and vice versa. It does nothing to the actual audio that is being recorded, and it does not require a special decoder. Any HX Pro recorded tape will have, in theory, better sound on any deck.
* Dolby Advanced Audio: Dolby surround sound, locking preferred volume level, optimizes audio performance for specific PC models and lets turning up the volume to the built-in speakers without distorting the sound.

===Audio encoding/compression===

* Dolby Surround
* Dolby Digital (also known as AC-3) is a lossy audio compression format. It supports channel configurations from mono up to six discrete channels (referred to as &quot;5.1&quot;). This format first allowed and popularized surround sound. It was first developed for movie theater sound and spread to Laserdisc and DVD. It has been adopted in many broadcast formats including all North American digital television (ATSC), DVB-T, direct broadcast satellite, cable television, DTMB, IPTV, and surround sound radio services. It is also part of both the Blu-ray and the now-defunct HD DVD standards. Dolby Digital is used to enable surround sound output by most video game consoles. Several personal computers support converting all audio to Dolby Digital for output.
** Dolby Digital EX: introduces a matrix-encoded center rear surround channel to Dolby Digital for 6.1 channel output. This center-rear channel is often split to two rear back speakers for 7.1 channel output.
** Dolby Digital Plus (also known as E-AC-3) is a lossy audio codec based on Dolby Digital that is backward compatible, but more advanced. The DVD Forum has selected Dolby Digital Plus as a standard audio format for HD DVD video. It supports data rates up to 6 Mbit/s, an increase from Dolby Digital&#x27;s 640 kbit/s maximum. On Blu-ray, Dolby Digital Plus is implemented differently, as a legacy 640 kbit/s Dolby Digital stream plus an additional stream to expand the surround sound, with a total bandwidth of approximately 1.7 Mbit/s. Dolby Digital Plus is also optimized for limited data-rate environments such as Digital broadcasting.
** Dolby Digital Live is a real-time hardware encoding technology for interactive media such as video games. It converts any audio signals on a PC or game console into the 5.1-channel Dolby Digital format and transports it via a single S/PDIF cable. A similar technology known as DTS Connect is available from competitor DTS.
* Dolby E: professional coding system optimized for the distribution of surround and multichannel audio through digital two-channel post-production and broadcasting infrastructures, or for recording surround audio on two audio tracks of conventional digital video tapes, video servers, communication links, switchers, and routers. The Dolby E signal does not reach viewers at home. It is transcoded to Dolby Digital at a lower data rate for final DTV transmission.
* Dolby Stereo (also known as &quot;Stereo A&quot;): original analog optical technology developed for 35 mm prints and is encoded with four sound channels: Left/Center/Right (which are located behind the screen) and Surround (which is heard over speakers on the sides and rear of the theatre) for ambient sound and special effects. This technology also employs A-type or SR-type noise reduction, listed above with regards to analog cassette tapes. See also Dolby Surround
* Dolby TrueHD: Offers bit-for-bit sound reproduction identical to the studio master. Over seven full-range 24-bit/96 kHz discrete channels are supported (plus an LFE channel, making it 7.1 surround) along with the HDMI interface. Theoretically, Dolby TrueHD can support more channels, but this number has been limited to 8 for HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc.
* Dolby Pulse: released in 2009, it is identical to the HE-AAC v2 codec except for the addition of Dolby metadata, which is common for Dolby&#x27;s other digital audio codecs. This metadata &quot;ensures consistency of broadcast quality.&quot;
* Dolby AC-4 is a lossy audio compression format that can contain audio channels and/or audio objects.
*Dolby Atmos is a suite of technologies for immersive audio having both horizontal and vertical sound placement, using a combination of channel and object-based mixing and delivery. It was first introduced in cinemas with Brave (2012 film). The first game released with Dolby Atmos audio was Star Wars Battlefront (2015 video game). The means of delivering the channels and objects differ given the technical limitations across different media, and the target platform. Dolby Atmos is not a codec; on the consumer market, pre-recorded Dolby Atmos is delivered as an extension to a Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Digital Plus, or Dolby AC-4 stream.

===Audio processing===

* Dolby Headphone: an implementation of virtual surround, simulating 5.1 surround sound in a standard pair of stereo headphones.
* Dolby Virtual Speaker: simulates 5.1 surround sound in a setup of two standard stereo speakers.
* Dolby Surround, Dolby Pro Logic, Dolby Pro Logic II, Dolby Pro Logic IIx, and Dolby Pro Logic IIz: these decoders expand sound to a greater number of channels. All can decode surround sound that has been matrixed into two channels; some can expand surround sound to a greater number of speakers than the original source material. See the referenced articles for more details on each decoder.
* Audistry: sound enhancement technologies.
* Dolby Volume: reduces volume level changes.
* Dolby Mobile: A version of Dolby&#x27;s surround sound technology specifically designed for mobile phones, notably the HTC Desire HD, LG Arena and LG Renoir.
* Dolby Audio Plug-in for Android: An API packaged as a Java Library that allows Android Developers to take advantage of Dolby Digital Plus Technology embedded into mobile and tablet devices, notably the Fire HD, Fire HDX, and Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 series.
* Dolby Voice: Hardware and software products for enterprise-level web conferencing.

===Video processing===

* Dolby Contrast provides enhanced image contrast to LCD screens with LED backlight units by means of local dimming.
* Perceptual Quantizer (PQ), published by SMPTE as SMPTE ST 2084, is a transfer function that allows for the display of high dynamic range (HDR) video with a luminance level of up to 10,000cd/m2 and can be used with the Rec. 2020 color space. On August 27, 2015, the Consumer Electronics Association announced the HDR10 Media Profile which uses the Rec. 2020 color space, SMPTE ST 2084, and a bit depth of 10-bits. On August 2, 2016, Microsoft released the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which supports the HDR10 format with PQ (ST 2084) transfer function and Rec.2020 color space.
* Dolby Vision is a content mastering and delivery format similar to the HDR10 media profile. It supports both high dynamic range (HDR) and wide color gamut (ITU-R Rec. 2020 and 2100) at all stages from content creation and production to transmission and playback. Dolby Vision includes the Perceptual Quantizier (SMPTE ST-2084) electro-optical transfer function and supports displays with up to 10,000-nit maximum brightness (4,000-nit in practice). It also provides up to 8K resolution and color depth of up to 12-bits (backwards compatible with current 8-bit and 10-bit displays). Dolby Vision can encode mastering display colorimetry information using static metadata (SMPTE ST 2086) and dynamic metadata (SMPTE ST 2094-10, Dolby format) for each scene or frame of a video. Examples of Ultra HD (UHD) Dolby Vision are available in TV, monitor, mobile devices and theater. Dolby Vision content can be delivered on Ultra HD Blu-ray discs, over conventional broadcasting, OTT, and online streaming media services. Dolby Vision metadata can be carried via HDMI interface versions 1.4b and above. It also supports IPTPQc2 color space, that is similar to ICtCp. Dolby Vision IQ is an update designed to optimize Dolby Vision content according to the brightness of the room.
* ICtCp provides an improved color representation that is designed for high dynamic range (HDR) and wide color gamut (WCG). An improved constant luminance is an advantage for color processing operations such as chroma subsampling and gamut mapping where only color information is changed. ICtCp is based on a modification of IPT called ICaCb.

===Digital cinema===

* Dolby Digital Cinema
* Dolby Surround 7.1, first introduced theatrically with &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, in 2010.
* Dolby 3D
* Dolby Atmos
* Dolby Cinema, a premium cinema concept developed by Dolby Laboratories as a direct competitor to IMAX.

===Live sound===
* Dolby Lake Processor - as of 2009, all Lake products are owned by Lab Gruppen.

Over the years Dolby has introduced several surround sound systems. Their differences are explained below.

==Dolby matrix surround systems==
==Dolby discrete surround systems==
==Controversy==
===ATSC===

Dolby Digital AC-3 is used as the audio codec for the ATSC standards, though it was standardized as A/52 by the ATSC. It allows the transport of up to five channels of sound with a sixth channel for low-frequency effects (the so-called &quot;5.1&quot; configuration). In contrast, Japanese ISDB HDTV broadcasts use MPEG&#x27;s Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) as the audio codec, which also allows 5.1 audio output. DVB allows both.

MPEG-2 audio was a contender for the ATSC standard during the &quot;Grand Alliance&quot; shootout, but lost out to Dolby AC-3. The Grand Alliance issued a statement finding the MPEG-2 system to be &quot;essentially equivalent&quot; to Dolby, but only after the Dolby selection had been made. Later, a story emerged that MIT had entered into an agreement with Dolby whereupon the university would be awarded a large sum of money if the MPEG-2 system was rejected. Dolby also offered an incentive for Zenith to switch their vote (which they did); however, it is unknown whether they accepted the offer.

<text>This article contains a list of kings of Rwanda. The Kingdom of Rwanda was ruled by sovereigns titled &quot;mwami&quot; (plural &quot;abami&quot;), and was one of the oldest and the most centralized kingdoms in the history of Central and East Africa.

Its state and affairs before King Gihanga I are largely unconfirmed and highly shrouded in mythical tales.

==Timeline (1700–1961)==

==Pretenders since 1961==
On 28 January 1961, in the coup of Gitarama during what was dubbed the Rwandan Revolution by the Belgian-favored Hutu extremist party Parmehutu, the Belgian colonial overseers abolished the monarchy and Rwanda became a republic (retroactively approved by a Hutu led referendum held on 25 September of the same year). Afterwards, Kigeli V Ndahindurwa continued to maintain his claim to the throne until his death on 16 October 2016 in Washington, D.C. On 9 January 2017, the Royal Council of Abiru announced Prince Emmanuel Bushayija as the new heir to the throne. Prince Emmanuel adopted the regnal name Yuhi VI.

<text>This article lists the presidents of Rwanda since the creation of the office in 1961 (during the Rwandan Revolution), to the present day.

The president of Rwanda is the head of state and head of executive of the Republic of Rwanda. The president is elected every seven years by popular vote, and appoints the prime minister and all other members of Cabinet.

A total of four people have served in the office. The incumbent president is Paul Kagame, who took office on 22 April 2000, after being acting president for nearly a month.

==Term limits==
There was a two-term limit for the president in the Constitution of Rwanda. The constitutional referendum in 2015 allowed Paul Kagame third seven-year term, and ability to run for further two five-year terms thereafter.

<text>This list of grape varieties includes cultivated grapes, whether used for wine, or eating as a table grape, fresh or dried (raisin, currant, sultana). For a complete list of all grape species, including those unimportant to agriculture, see &quot;Vitis&quot;.

The term &quot;grape variety&quot; refers to cultivars (rather than the botanical varieties that must be named according to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants).

== Single-species grapes ==

While some of the grapes in this list are hybrids, they are hybridized within a single species. For those grapes hybridized across species, known as interspecific hybrids, see the section on multispecies hybrid grapes below.

Hybrid grape varieties (see Hybrid grapes) or &quot;hybrids&quot; is, in fact, the popular term for a subset of what are properly known as &quot;hybrids&quot;, specifically crossings between one species of the genus vitis and another. The scientific definition of a hybrid grape is any crossing (intra- or inter-specific) of two grape varieties. In keeping with the popular definition, however, the ones listed below are inter-specific hybrids where one parent is a European grape. Most of these are complex mixtures of three or more species and all parents are not always clearly known.

<text>The president of Senegal () is the head of state of Senegal. In accordance with the constitutional reform of 2001 and since a referendum that took place on 20 March 2016, the president is elected for a 5-year term, with a limit of two consecutive terms. The following is a list of presidents of Senegal, since the country gained independence from France in 1960.

==Election process==
===Inauguration===
The Senegalese Constitution provides the following oath for the president which must be taken before they enter into office:

==Term==
===Term duration===
In 1991, presidential term lengths were extended from five to seven years.

In January 2001, during Abdoulaye Wade&#x27;s first term, a constitutional referendum reduced the presidential term back to five years. 

In July 2008, during Wade&#x27;s second term, the National Assembly approved a constitutional amendment increasing the length of the presidential term back to seven years, as it was prior to the adoption of the 2001 constitution. This extension did not apply to Abdoulaye Wade&#x27;s 2007–2012 term.

In 2016, during Macky Sall&#x27;s first term, per another constitutional referendum, the length of the presidential term was decreased back to five years. The amendments were adopted in constitutional law № 2016-10.

===Term limits===
As of 2021, there is a two-term limit for the president in the Constitution of Senegal. Abdoulaye Wade was controversially allowed to run for president in 2012 following the 2008 constitutional amendment, but lost re-election to Macky Sall.

==Privileges==
===Buildings===

The Palace of the Republic () is the presidential residence, located in Dakar in the Plateau district. After having been the official residence of the Governor-General of French West Africa. The construction of the palace in its first state was ordered in 1902 by Gaston Doumergue, Minister of the Colonies, to house in the capital the Governor General of French West Africa who was then residing in Saint-Louis. The architect was Henri Deglane.

<doc id="450101" wikidata="Q5232692" url="?curid=450101" title="USS Houston (CL-81)">
<text>USS &quot;Houston&quot; (CL-81) was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

She was active in the Pacific War and survived two separate aerial torpedo hits in October 1944.

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Houston&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-four Bofors guns in four quadruple and four double mounts and twenty-one Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Houston&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==
&quot;Houston&quot; was laid down at the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company at Newport News, Virginia on 4 August 1941, originally under the name &quot;Vicksburg&quot;. On 12 October 1942, she was renamed &quot;Houston&quot;; some five months before, on 30 May, 1,000 Navy recruits, known as the Houston Volunteers, were sworn in at a dedication ceremony in downtown Houston but with a nineteen-month period between then and commissioning, only one served aboard the new &quot;Houston&quot;. The completed hull was launched on 19 June 1943. Fitting-out work was completed by December that year, and she was commissioned on the 20th. The ship got underway on 1 February 1944 to begin her shakedown cruise. She initially sailed to the Caribbean Sea, and then returned north for initial training off Boston. On 16 April, she left for the Pacific Ocean to join the war effort there. She passed through the Panama Canal and sailed north to San Diego, before continuing on to Pearl Harbor. She arrived there on 6 May and carried out further training exercises for the next few weeks.

===World War II operations===
&quot;Houston&quot; departed from Hawaii later in May and arrived in Majuro Atoll on the 31st, where she joined the anti-aircraft screen for the aircraft carriers of the Fast Carrier Task Force, then part of the Fifth Fleet. There, she was assigned to Task Group (TG) 58.4, which was centered on the aircraft carrier and the light carriers and . She and the rest of the fleet then began the invasion of the Mariana and Palau Islands. The fleet got underway on 5 June and began air strikes on the islands on 12 June to prepare for the amphibious invasion, which started with the invasion of Saipan on 15 June. For their part, the Japanese launched their counter-attack with the recently formed 1st Mobile Fleet. In the resulting Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 June, &quot;Houston&quot; contributed her anti-aircraft guns to the fleet&#x27;s defense. After American air strikes on the 1st Mobile Fleet sank two of the Japanese carriers, the Japanese withdrew, allowing the American fleet to return to operations in support of the Marianas campaign. On 26 June, &quot;Houston&quot; joined the shore bombardment unit that targeted Guam and Rota. During the bombardment, she destroyed ten aircraft, the airstrip they occupied, and a radar installation. &quot;Houston&quot; thereafter sailed for Eniwetok to replenish ammunition for the next operation.

By this time, the Fast Carrier Task Force had passed to the command of the Third Fleet, and all of the units were renumbered. &quot;Houston&quot; was transferred to TG 38.2, which included the carriers , , and , the light carriers and , and the fast battleships and . The task force departed on 30 August to begin air strikes on the Palau Islands to prepare for the upcoming invasion of Peleliu. The carriers struck the islands on 6 September, after which &quot;Houston&quot; and several destroyers bombarded Peleliu and other islands in the area. The Fast Carrier Task Force then sailed west to neutralize Japanese airfields in the Philippines before returning for another series of attacks on Peleliu from 17 to 19 September to support American ground forces that had landed on the island on the 15th. The fleet then departed for Ulithi atoll to prepare for the next offensive, arriving there on 1 October. There, the fleet was reorganized again, and &quot;Houston&quot; was assigned to TG 38.1, which included the carriers and and the light carriers &quot;Cowpens&quot; and .

====Formosa raid and torpedoing====
On 6 October, the Fast Carrier Task Force sortied to carry out a series of air strikes on Japanese targets in the western Pacific. These began with attacks on Okinawa on 10 October, followed by attacks on Formosa two days later. The Formosa Air Battle lasted for three days, and American forces inflicted serious damage to the Japanese 2nd Air Fleet based on the island. &quot;Houston&quot;″s anti-aircraft gunners claimed four aircraft shot down on 12 October, and three more on 14 October. During the latter engagement late in the day, a Japanese torpedo bomber hit &quot;Houston&quot; with a torpedo in one of her engine rooms. The hole flooded all four machinery spaces, which disabled power aboard the ship. The torpedo hit from the starboard side while &quot;Houston&quot; was turning right at a speed of , so her hull was listing to port; as a result, the torpedo hit on the bottom of the hull. The ship&#x27;s damage control teams began work immediately and began efforts to control flooding; eventually, they were able to contain flooding and pump some undamaged compartments empty.

The heavy cruiser took &quot;Houston&quot; under tow to evacuate the crippled vessel, though the tugboat had taken over the towline later that night. As the ship could no longer feed or house her crew due to the damage, most of the men were evacuated save the captain and damage control teams. She and the heavy cruiser , which had also been disabled by a torpedo hit, came under heavy attack from the 2nd Air Fleet on 16 October, and &quot;Houston&quot; was struck by a second torpedo in the stern, directly above her rudder. The explosion ignited the starboard tank that held fuel for the ship&#x27;s reconnaissance floatplanes, causing a major fire in the aircraft hangar, though the remaining crew suppressed the blaze within fifteen minutes. Flooding from this hit degraded the ship&#x27;s buoyancy and stability further. Another 300 men were evacuated afterward, leaving just 200 aboard to continue damage control efforts as the ships withdrew.

The Japanese believed the withdrawing formation might be intercepted, and sortied from the Inland Sea in an attempt to sink them, but an American air attack forced them to withdraw. &quot;Houston&quot; and &quot;Canberra&quot; had arrived back at Ulithi by 27 October; there, &quot;Houston&quot; underwent temporary repairs with assistance from the repair ship . There were no floating dry docks large enough to accommodate &quot;Houston&quot;, but significant hull repairs were nevertheless effected and much of the flooding was pumped out. This work allowed her to steam to Manus Island for further work, arriving there on 20 December. There, the floating dry dock took the cruiser aboard, allowing the rest of the hull damage to be plated over and the remaining water pumped out. Two of her boilers were also restored to operation, along with the No. 2 and 3 engines, allowing her to get underway in February. From there, she sailed to the New York Navy Yard for permanent repairs, which she reached on 24 March 1945. Work lasted until 11 October, by which time the war had ended with the surrender of Japan. In the course of the ship&#x27;s wartime service, &quot;Houston&quot; received three battle stars.

===Post-War service===

After returning to active service, &quot;Houston&quot; conducted refresher training for her crew in the Caribbean. She then joined training maneuvers held off Newport, Rhode Island. On 16 April 1946, she embarked on a goodwill cruise to visit European ports, including cities in Scandinavia, Portugal, and Italy; she also stopped in Egypt while cruising the Mediterranean Sea. &quot;Houston&quot; arrived back in the United States on 14 December and thereafter took part in various training exercises through 17 May 1947. At that time, she joined Cruiser Division 12 for another voyage to the Mediterranean. She returned to Philadelphia on 16 August, and was decommissioned on 15 December. She was allocated to the reserve fleet, remaining in the Navy&#x27;s inventory until 1 March 1959, when she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and sold to be broken up.

<doc id="450104" wikidata="Q3113369" url="?curid=450104" title="Little Saigon">
<text>Little Saigon () is a name given to ethnic enclaves of expatriate Vietnamese mainly in English-speaking countries. Alternate names include Little Vietnam and Little Hanoi (mainly in historically communist nations), depending on the enclave&#x27;s political history. To avoid political undertones due to the renaming of Saigon to Ho Chi Minh City, it is occasionally called by the neutral name Vietnamtown (). Saigon is the former name of the capital of the former South Vietnam (now Ho Chi Minh City), where a large number of first-generation Vietnamese immigrants emigrating to the United States originate from, whereas Hanoi is the current capital of Vietnam.

The most well-established and largest Vietnamese-American enclaves, not all of which are called Little Saigon, are in Orange County, California; San Jose, California; and Houston, Texas. Relatively smaller communities also exist, including the comparatively nascent Vietnamese commercial districts in San Francisco, San Diego, Atlanta, Sacramento, Philadelphia, Denver, Oklahoma City, New Orleans, the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex (Haltom City, Arlington, and Garland), Falls Church, Virginia, Orlando, and Seattle.

Additionally, Vietnamese-Americans and Vietnamese-Canadians also established businesses and bringing distinctively Vietnamese elements to most Chinatowns; some examples include the Chinatowns of Las Vegas, Boston, Houston, Honolulu, Manhattan, and Edmonton, Alberta.

==Locations in America==

=== California ===
An intercity bus service named Xe Đò Hoàng connects the Little Saigon in Orange county to the one in San Jose and various other cities in California and Arizona with high concentration of Vietnamese Americans.

==== Orange County ====
The oldest, largest, and most prominent Little Saigon is centered in Orange County, California, where over 189,000 Vietnamese Americans reside. With other Southern California counties, this region constitutes the largest Vietnamese American (VA) population outside of Vietnam. The community originally started emerging in Westminster, and quickly spread to the adjacent city of Garden Grove. Today, these two cities rank as the highest concentration of Vietnamese-Americans of any cities in the United States at 37.1% and 31.1%, respectively (according to the 2011 American Community Survey).

About south of Los Angeles, Westminster was once a predominantly white middle-class suburban city of Orange County with ample farmland, but the city later experienced a decline by the 1970s. Since 1978, the nucleus of Little Saigon has long been Bolsa Avenue, where early pioneers Danh Quach and Frank Jao established businesses. During that year, the well-known &quot;Nguoi Viet Daily News&quot; also began publishing from a home in Garden Grove. Other new Vietnamese-American arrivals soon revitalized the area by opening their own businesses in old, formerly white-owned storefronts, and investors constructed large shopping centers containing a mix of businesses. The Vietnamese community and businesses later spread into adjacent Garden Grove, Midway City, Fountain Valley, Stanton, Anaheim, and Santa Ana.

In Orange County, Little Saigon is now a wide, spread-out community dotted with myriad suburban-style strip malls containing a mixture of Vietnamese and Chinese-Vietnamese businesses. It is located southwest of Disneyland between the State Route 22 and Interstate 405. However, the main focus of Little Saigon is Bolsa Avenue (where Asian Garden Mall and Little Saigon Plaza are considered the heart), which runs through Westminster; the street was officially designated Little Saigon by the city council of Westminster in the late 1980s. The borders of Little Saigon can be considered to be Trask Avenue and W McFadden Avenue on the north and south and Euclid Street and Magnolia Street on the east and west, respectively. About three-quarters of the population in this area are Vietnamese.
Westminster is generally considered the main cultural center of the Vietnamese American community with several Vietnamese-language television stations, radio stations, and newspapers originating from Little Saigon and adjacent areas. At least one radio station broadcast 24 hours a day in Vietnamese and 4 television substations broadcasting in Vietnamese 24 hours a day as of 2009, and several newspapers serve the Vietnamese-American community. Little Saigon has also emerged as the prominent center of the Vietnamese pop music industry with several recording studios, and with a recording industry many times larger than in Vietnam itself. Vietnamese music recorded in Westminster are distributed and sold in Vietnamese communities throughout the United States and in Australia, France, and Germany as well as illegally in Vietnam.

Garden Grove Park is the location of an annual Vietnamese Lunar New Year festival held in late January - early February known as Tết. Small amusement park rides, dances, and contests are held in Garden Grove Park which is across the street from Bolsa Grande High School grounds and is hosted by the Union of Vietnamese Student Association (UVSA). Since 2013, the annual festival has been relocated to the OC Fair Grounds in Costa Mesa.

The Vietnamese American population has now begun to diffuse from Little Saigon to traditionally working-class Hispanic cities, such as Santa Ana, and southward to professional middle-class predominantly white cities such as Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach, Irvine, and Orange. Over the years, the vibrant community of Little Saigon has experienced frequent openings and closures of small mom-and-pop Vietnamese businesses, resulting in sights of some abandoned strip plazas. The changing landscape of the Vietnamese American population would bring a more multicultural flavor to Orange County, but as with Chinatowns, could potentially eliminate its identity as a &quot;Little Saigon&quot; as the population of foreign-born Vietnamese old-timers declines and more younger generations of Vietnamese American families attune to mainstream American culture (especially with a preference for fashionable malls over the Vietnamese ethnic malls in Little Saigon) and move on to affluent communities further away from the Little Saigon area.

==== San Diego ====

When the &quot;first wave&quot; of Vietnamese immigrants started to arrive in 1981, many settled in the communities adjacent to San Diego State University, such as City Heights and Talmadge, better known as East San Diego. As families and individuals became more affluent however, many relocated to other communities in the city: Linda Vista, Clairemont, Serra Mesa, etc. (Central San Diego) and what was then brand-new tract communities such as Mira Mesa, Rancho Penasquitos, Rancho Bernardo, etc.

With a population of about 50,000, the San Diego metropolitan area ranks as one of the largest Vietnamese communities in the United States. Because of the Vietnamese population&#x27;s unique migration patterns in the city, it does not have a huge concentration of Vietnamese businesses in a particular area like other metropolitan areas (e.g., Westminster, San Jose, Houston, etc.) Still, there are three notable Vietnamese business districts in the San Diego region: Mira Mesa Boulevard (North San Diego), El Cajon Boulevard (East San Diego), and Convoy Street/Linda Vista Road (Central San Diego).

The area on El Cajon Boulevard in East San Diego will be getting official City of San Diego status as &quot;Little Saigon San Diego,&quot; as referenced on the web page littlesaigonsandiego.org.

On June 4, 2013, City Council approved Little Saigon Cultural and Commercial District in City Heights, San Diego, which is a six-block section of El Cajon Boulevard from Euclid to Highland avenues. On February 1, 2019, Little Saigon signs were revealed to be installed on Interstate 15.

====San Gabriel Valley====

Due to the large influx and presence of relatively poor ethnic Chinese refugees from Vietnam in the 1980s (which also coincided with the arrival of immigrant elites from Taiwan and Hong Kong), the San Gabriel Valley region of Los Angeles has another important concentration of Vietnamese in Southern California. While not generally referred to as &quot;Little Saigon&quot;, the stretch of Garvey Avenue in the working-class barrios of Rosemead, South El Monte, and El Monte have a relatively heavy but scattered collection of businesses owned mainly by majority ethnic Chinese Vietnamese with a growing number of ethnic Vietnamese residents and business owners as well. Many of these businesses are housed in tiny strip malls while others occupy freestanding, aging buildings. These Vietnamese businesses are very gradually replacing businesses owned by Hispanics.

Rosemead is the Vietnamese center of the San Gabriel Valley. One particular shopping center in Rosemead, called Diamond Square, is anchored by the Taiwanese American chain 99 Ranch Market (now closed) and contains various Chinese Vietnamese small businesses and a food court catering to local Asians. The Diamond Square is now closed, replaced by The Square anchored by Korean American stores. The 99 Ranch Market is replaced by the Square Supermarket.

It remains a major hub for working-class Vietnamese and Mainland Chinese expatriates residing in the area. Many Vietnamese of ethnic Chinese origin also tend to own various businesses - especially supermarkets, restaurants, beauty parlors, and auto repair shops - in the main general mixed-Chinese commercial thoroughfares of Garvey Avenue in Monterey Park, California and Valley Boulevard in Alhambra, California, San Gabriel, California, and Rosemead. There are already several phở and bánh mì eateries represented along Valley Boulevard.

The Sriracha hot sauce manufacturer Huy Fong Foods (known for its rooster logo and found in countless Vietnamese restaurants) is owned by a Chinese Vietnamese refugee named David Tran and was originally located in Chinatown, Los Angeles but it relocated to its larger facility in Rosemead.

In 2005, John Tran became the first Vietnamese American to be elected to a seat on the city council of Rosemead. Since 2006, he has been the mayor of the city, a position that is held by rotation among the council members.

====San Jose====
Comprising over 180,000 residents, about 10.6% of the population, (as of the 2010 U.S. Census) San Jose&#x27;s Vietnamese community is comparable to the one in Orange County. San Jose has more Vietnamese residents than any single city outside of Vietnam. Vietnamese-language radio programs from Orange County are rebroadcast in the region, though San Jose does contain locally produced Vietnamese-language radio and TV stations such as Que Huong Media, Vien Thao, and Vietoday TV. Although &quot;Viet Mercury&quot;, the Vietnamese-language edition of the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;, is now discontinued, many other publications offer Vietnamese literature enjoyed by the community, such as Thang Mo and Trieu Thanh magazines as well as newspapers from Calitoday, Viet Bao, Thoi Bao Daily News (now defunct), and Viet Nam Nhat Bao (Vietnam Daily News). Several strip malls on Tully Road (stretching from Senter Road to Quimby Road) and Senter Road (from Capitol Expressway to Burke Street by Costco), cater to Vietnamese tastes, such as Lion Plaza on the intersection of Tully and King (anchored by Lion Supermarket) and Carribbees Center on Senter and Lewis (anchored by Cho Senter Market, now Lee&#x27;s Supermarket). 

The epicenter of the Vietnamese-American community of San Jose, however, is on Story Road (stretching from Senter Road to McLaughlin Avenue), home to the popular Grand Century Mall and Vietnam Town (both shopping malls are owned by Chinese-Vietnamese real estate developer Lap Tang) and is officially designated by the San Jose City Council as &quot;Little Saigon&quot;. Like its counterpart in Orange County, a freeway offramp sign was placed in 2013 on Highway 101 and Freeway 280, designating the Story Road (from Highway 101) and McLaughlin Avenue (from Freeway 280) exits to Little Saigon. Lee&#x27;s Sandwiches, (a Vietnamese bánh mì sandwich chain eatery) as well as the phở chain, Pho Hoa Restaurant, had their first locations here in San Jose. Due to the ethnic diversity of the city, where Vietnamese-Americans here live side by side with other ethnic minorities such as Mexican-Americans, Filipino-Americans, and Indian-Americans, the Vietnamese community in San Jose is more fully integrated into the local community.

The Vietnamese community of San Jose has been politically divided over the naming of the business district, with various groups favoring &quot;Little Saigon&quot;, &quot;New Saigon&quot;, and &quot;Vietnamese Business District&quot;. Non-Vietnamese businesses and residents, as well as the San Jose Hispanic Chamber of Commerce have also opposed the name &quot;Little Saigon&quot;. In November 2007, the San Jose City Council voted 8–3 to choose the compromise name &quot;Saigon Business District&quot;, resulting in ongoing protest, debate, and an effort to recall city council member Madison Nguyen, who proposed the name &quot;Saigon Business District&quot;. On March 4, 2008, after a public meeting in which more than 1000 &quot;Little Saigon&quot; supporters participated, the city council voted 11–1 to rescind the name &quot;Saigon Business District&quot;, but stopped short of renaming it. The recall of Nguyen failed in March 2009.

San Jose also granted the building of the Viet Museum in Kelley Park next to the City Historic Museum. The Viet Museum had its grand opening August 25, 2007.

==== Sacramento ====
With a large and growing Vietnamese American population, in February 2010, a stretch of Stockton Boulevard in Sacramento from Florin Road to Fruitridge Road has been officially named &quot;Little Saigon&quot;. Although settlement of Vietnamese refugees began during the 1980s, large numbers of Vietnamese have moved from the San Jose area to the Sacramento area since the late 1990s and 2000s (decade) (especially after the dot-com bust in Silicon Valley). People were drawn to the area by lower housing prices, lower cost of living, and Vietnamese and Chinese enclaves. The large Asian supermarket Shun Fat Supermarket (a small Southern California-based chain owned by a Chinese Vietnamese American) opened in 2000 to cater to the local community and anchors Pacific Plaza. One of the First Vietnamese-Chinese owned supermarkets was Vinh Phat Supermarket. SF Supermarket is a prominent fixture at the intersections of 65th and Stockton Boulevard. This center also houses Huong Lan, which is famous for Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches. In 2010, a new 99 Ranch Market opened on Florin Road. The strip of Stockton Boulevard has a great number of Vietnamese and Chinese restaurants and many places for ethnic foods, such as &quot;phở&quot; and boba. There are nearby Vietnamese Chinese shopping centers planned for development, including Little Saigon Plaza (to be anchored by a supermarket) that is to be developed by prominent San Jose-based Vietnamese American developers. Other current shopping centers sport names such as Little Vietnam and Pacific Rim Plaza. As a testament to the area&#x27;s burgeoning Vietnamese community, the Southgate branch (66th Avenue, near Stockton Boulevard) of Sacramento Public library carries a large collection of Vietnamese materials.

==== San Francisco ====
In early 2004, San Francisco officially designated Larkin Street between Eddy and O&#x27;Farrell streets as &quot;Little Saigon&quot; (&quot;Sài Gòn Nhỏ&quot;). Located in the Tenderloin district where 2,000 of the city&#x27;s 13,000 Vietnamese-American residents live, the two-block stretch is more than 80% Vietnamese-owned. Unlike San Jose, with its larger ethnic Vietnamese population, the ethnic Chinese from Vietnam are well represented in San Francisco due to self-segregation. Banners and directional signs have already been posted. A formal symbolic entrance was erected in July 2008, akin to those for San Francisco&#x27;s Japantown and Chinatown (albeit smaller).

==== Oakland ====
The region stretching from 1st Avenue to 23rd Avenue in Oakland, California&#x27;s San Antonio district Eastlake neighborhood is known as Little Saigon of Oakland. The local Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce estimates that there are approximately 8,000 people of Vietnamese origin or descent living in Oakland, largely concentrated in Eastlake. Vietnamese businesses are concentrated along International Boulevard and East 12th Street in the district, and include Oakland&#x27;s Sun Hop Fat market, a fruit and grocery store that was one of the first. Currently there are dozens of Vietnamese-owned businesses in the area that serve the Vietnamese immigrant community, including restaurants, print shops, jewelry stores, and a karaoke machine store. Shop signs are typically bilingually English and Vietnamese. Yellow Vietnamese Freedom flags and the signs of &quot;Welcome to Little Saigon Oakland&quot; are visible everywhere, as are yellow and red Vietnamese silk flowers in the shape of cherry blossoms called &quot;Mai&quot;.

In 2019, local business owners lobbied for the formal city recognition of the area as “Little Saigon” and began working on a proposal for the creation of a Business Improvement District (BID)—a region in which local businesses and sometimes additional property owners pay a tax surcharge or mandatory fee to fund neighborhood events, clean-up efforts, local beautification efforts, and marketing campaigns to promote the district as such rather than individual businesses within it. The 2019-2021 city council budget allocated $125,000 for BID feasibility studies in both Eastlake and Oakland&#x27;s Chinatown.

The Oakland Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce organizes the annual Vietnamese Mid-Autumn Festival, in Clinton Square Park at the intersection of East 12th Street and 7th Avenue. The Oakland Vietnamese Mid-Autumn Festival occurs alongside many Mid-Autumn Festivals (&quot;Asian New Year&quot;) celebrations for different East Asian communities across the San Francisco Bay Area.

In the summer of 2021, the Oakland Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce, along with Good Good Eatz (a program funded by the East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation to promote ethnic food districts) and Pokémon Go developer Niantic organized a &quot;Summer Fest&quot; centered on Pokémon Go events and local food, along with retro video games made available by the Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment and COVID-19 testing and vaccinations.

==== Elsewhere ====
Large concentrations of Vietnamese live in Central districts of Los Angeles, although are outnumbered by other Asians and even more numerous Latinos. Unofficially, Riverside County, Fresno and Oxnard has some Vietnamese. 

===Colorado===
A growing Vietnamese commercial district has emerged on Federal Boulevard between the Far East Center shopping complex between West Alameda and West Mississippi Avenues in Denver, Colorado, with Vietnamese cuisine eateries and various businesses. With the leadership of business owners, the Vietnamese American Community of Colorado, Denver Asian Pacific Commission and Denver City Councilman Paul Lopez, the Little Saigon Business District was formed honoring its rich Vietnamese culture in 2014. There is also a growing Vietnamese population in Aurora, Colorado, specifically in an area bordered to the north by Alameda Avenue, to the south by E. Hampden Avenue, to the east by Chambers Road, and to the west by Havana Street. There are currently about 21,000 Vietnamese people living in the Denver-Aurora-Boulder Metro Area.

===Florida===
A thriving Vietnamese quarter called &quot;Little Saigon&quot; exists in the Colonialtown district of Orlando, Florida. The neighborhood has become a landmark in the city of Orlando and consists of a growing number of restaurants, groceries, and Vietnamese professional offices that serve the local Vietnamese community with everything from taxes to medical and dental care. Stores supply Asian pop culture to the community in the form of karaoke bars, bubble tea shops, Vietnamese video and music shops, and stores featuring candies and collectibles from across Asia. The heart of the district is the intersection of East Colonial Drive / Highway 50 and Mills Avenue, also known as the &quot;Vi-Mi&quot; district.

The Orlando Vietnamese community has its roots in war refugees seeking a new life in America after the fall of Saigon. Notable pro-democracy activists, such as Thuong Nguyen Foshee, who was just recently released from prison in Vietnam, call Orlando their home.

The Vietnamese Community in Orlando, along with institutions like Chua Bao An, St. Philip Phan Van Minh Church, Vietnamese Baptist Church, and groups such as The Vietnamese Association of Central Florida, strive to maintain their heritage as well as share their culture with the rest of Orlando. Annual events, such as the numerous Tet New Year Celebrations at the Central Florida Fairgrounds and across the city, help spread Vietnamese culture and promote diversity throughout Orlando.

===Georgia===
There are many Vietnamese businesses located in the mixed-Asian – that is, co-existing with ethnic Korean and Chinese businesses – commercial and cultural strip of Buford Highway in Doraville and Chamblee, which are working-class suburbs in DeKalb County north of Atlanta. Although a fair number of post-war Vietnamese refugees settled in Atlanta earlier, many Vietnamese Americans from California and other parts of the United States have been relocating into the Atlanta area to establish a fairly large presence since the 1990s. Metropolitan Atlanta is home to one of the fastest-growing Vietnamese populations in the world.

===Gulf Coast===
It is estimated that there are 40,000 Vietnamese-Americans in the Gulf Coast, and 1 in every 4 fishermen from the area is Vietnamese-American.

====Alabama====
Vietnamese-Americans make up one-third of the population in the fishing hamlet of Bayou La Batre. A majority of the community work in the seafood industry, while a smaller percentage work in the shipbuilding industry. The eastern side of the city is nicknamed &quot;Little Vietnam&quot; due to the high number of Vietnamese-American residents. Vietnamese businesses have been sustained by the social integration of the Vietnamese and mainstream cultures. The city also sees, within the Vietnamese American community, a large sub-community of Amerasians. Many were brought to the US through the Amerasian Homecoming Act and relocated to the area due to similarities in environment and industry to what they were accustomed to.

====Louisiana====

Louisiana is home to many Vietnamese, many of whom especially engaged in traditional fishing. Both Louisiana and Vietnam had been French colonies. New Orleans has several areas with a concentration of Vietnamese-American businesses. The largest among these communities is located around Village de L&#x27;Est, which includes significant community and commercial institutions such as Mary Queen of Vietnam Church and Dong Phuong Oriental Bakery.

There is a Vietnamese business section in Baton Rouge, located near the 12000 block of Florida Boulevard (part of U.S. Route 190), which consists of restaurants, grocery stores, and other various businesses, even found throughout some other sections of the city.

In 2008, Anh &quot;Joseph&quot; Cao made history after being elected to Congress as a Republican from Louisiana&#x27;s heavily Democratic 2nd congressional district, which includes most of New Orleans. Cao served one term, and was the first person of Vietnamese ancestry ever elected to the U.S. Congress.

====Mississippi====
A small &quot;Little Saigon&quot; can be found on Oak Street in Biloxi. Many Vietnamese-Americans relocated to southern Mississippi due to the similar environment and industry they were accustomed to back in Vietnam. The Vietnamese-American labor force in this area is usually spread between the fishing, gambling, and shipbuilding industries.

=== Illinois ===

Argyle Street in the city of Chicago contains a Little Saigon district, and it has become the hub of vibrant Vietnamese culture in the city. It is referred to by Chicagoans as the &quot;New Chinatown&quot;, little Saigon, or most commonly Argyle. Argyle is easily accessible from the CTA Red Line&#x27;s Argyle station.

=== Kentucky ===
Louisville has an unofficial Vietnamese district, dubbed &quot;Little Saigon&quot; by TARC drivers back in the 1990s, centered on areas near South 3rd Street and Southside Drive, primarily in the Southside neighborhood. Although Vietnamese-American businesses, institutions and population etc. have spread to other parts of the county, they are still primarily concentrated near Iroquois Park, to its east, in the 40214 zip code.

===Massachusetts===
Dorchester, Massachusetts, a neighborhood of Boston, is home to a major Vietnamese business center in the Northeast. It serves some 75,000 Vietnam-born Americans in the Boston-Worcester area as well as those in surroundings states such as Connecticut and Rhode Island. Communities there are served by a number of Viet-organized social service agencies (such as The Southeast Asian Coalition in Worcester Viet-AID, the Vietnamese American Initiative for Development) and some religious and publicly funded organizations. Native Vietnamese who speak fluent Vietnamese, whether or not they live in Boston, are recruited for work here.

The &quot;X&quot; in Springfield is a magnet for Vietnamese businesses and the locus of Vietnamese settlement in western Massachusetts, including restaurants, businesses and a Vietnamese community center.

===Missouri===
Kansas City is home to more than 10,000 Vietnamese immigrants. A sizable Vietnamese population along Independence Avenue &amp; Garrison Square sprung up various businesses including &quot;phở&quot; restaurants, nail salons, hair salons, video gift stores, cell phone stores, pool halls and jewelry stores. One of the new &quot;Little Saigons&quot; can now be found on North Oak Trafficway in Kansas City Gladstone neighborhood.

St. Louis also has a large Vietnamese immigrant population. The majority of restaurants and stores are in &quot;South City&quot; on or near Grand Avenue.

=== Michigan ===

While not titled a &quot;Little Saigon&quot;, the suburban community of Madison Heights in the Detroit area has become a center of Vietnamese commerce. Located on John R Road and on Dequindre Road, several Vietnamese markets, Phở noodle soup restaurants, movie/music stores, several nail supply stores, herbal stores, and beauty salons have cropped up along two streets.

Besides Madison Heights, the Grand Rapids and Holland areas have a small Vietnamese enclave.

Inkster has a neighborhood known as &quot;Little Saigon,&quot; though this is in reference to the Vietnam war and not Vietnamese people or culture. &quot;Little Saigon&quot; is a collection of housing projects along Inkster Road and Annapolis where bullet holes and boarded windows are common.

=== New Mexico ===
Albuquerque, New Mexico has a small &quot;Little Saigon&quot; community with various Vietnamese restaurants and businesses on and around Central Avenue in the city&#x27;s International District.

=== New York ===
New York City&#x27;s unofficial &quot;Little Saigon&quot; Vietnamese community exists near the intersection of the Bowery and Grand Street. Although small compared with nearby Chinatown, the area is differentiated by the large presence of Vietnamese stores as compared with Chinese stores.

=== North Carolina ===
In Charlotte, Central Avenue (near Briar Creek Road) is the original &quot;Chinatown&quot; consisting of &quot;Saigon Square&quot; and a pair of other Chinese/Vietnamese shopping plazas that include &quot;Dim Sum Restaurant&quot; (which serves New York-style dim sum), the &quot;Eang Hong Supermarket&quot;, &quot;Van Loi&quot; (which serves cha shao), and a dozen or so other stores.

Saigon Square has various Vietnamese (albeit not Chinese) stores including Phở Hòa (Vietnamese noodles).
Asian Corner Mall on North Tryon Street and Sugar Creek Road, developed from the defunct Tryon Mall in 1999, with &quot;Dragon Court Restaurant&quot;, &quot;Hong Kong BBQ&quot;, &quot;International Supermarket&quot;, and &quot;New Century Market&quot; and several other Chinese/Vietnamese stores.

There are also areas in Greensboro where Vietnamese-run businesses (including stores and restaurants) are prevalent.

=== Oklahoma ===
Oklahoma City has a significant Vietnamese American business district and ethnic neighborhood located in the center part of the city. While it is officially known as Asian District by the city, due to the abundant Asian diversity of the neighborhood (similar in many respects to International District in Seattle), much of the original Little Saigon portion centers along Military Drive and NW 23rd Street between North Classen Boulevard and North Shartel Avenue.

Tens of thousands of Vietnamese refugees were relocated to Oklahoma City during the 1980s. Over time, they have established businesses in a gentrified area to the west of the Uptown NW 23rd and Classen Boulevard business districts and the area begun to be known as a &quot;Little Saigon&quot;.

The original Little Saigon area features numerous &quot;phở&quot; cafés, Vietnamese bakeries and restaurants, and Asian supermarkets. There are also numerous hopping nightclubs, karaoke, and video bars joining the growing list of Chinese, Thai, Filipino, and Korean residents and establishments that make up the remainder of surrounding Asian District.

The district is very popular with local residents and students from nearby Oklahoma City University, providing a colorful and authentic taste of the Far East in the heartland of America. Oklahoma City&#x27;s original Little Saigon neighborhood was featured in the New York Times as well as National Geographic&#x27;s March 2003 issue&#x27;s ZipUSA series titled &quot;73106: Lemongrass on the Prairie&quot;.

===Oregon===
10,641 Vietnamese Americans live in the Portland area. Many Vietnamese restaurants, markets, and other businesses in Portland can be found on NE Sandy Boulevard, SE Powell Boulevard, and NE and SE 82nd Avenue. There are also some Vietnamese business around the Portland area such as Beaverton, Hillsboro, Aloha, and Tigard.

===Pennsylvania===
South Philadelphia near the Italian Market has a large Vietnamese American population. Many Vietnamese businesses tucked in strip malls have emerged on Washington Avenue to service the local immigrant population. The Vietnamese sandwich bánh mì is gaining much attention in Philadelphia and is now competing with the Philly Cheesesteak.

As of 2005, Vietnamese are projected to become the largest ethnicity in South Philadelphia. Philadelphia is in the top ten U.S. cities for Vietnamese populations and Vietnamese immigration destinations. Philadelphia even has a higher percentage and numerical population of Vietnamese than New York City, one of the few Asian backgrounds that are actually less represented in New York.

===Tennessee===
Memphis has a significant Vietnamese community, affectionately known as &quot;Little Hanoi&quot; located along Cleveland Avenue in Midtown. The community includes many Vietnamese restaurants and shops, as well as a Vietnamese Buddhist temple and areas of predominantly Vietnamese housing. Little Hanoi is one of the last and largest non-Hispanic immigrant enclaves in the Memphis metropolitan area.

=== Texas ===
==== Austin ====
Austin has a Chinatown Center composed mainly of Vietnamese business on North Lamar.

==== Houston ====
The Houston area is home to over 150,000 Vietnamese people. A section of Midtown Houston known as &quot;Little Saigon&quot; or &quot;Vietnamtown&quot; was the original commercial district home for the Vietnamese community in Houston. The boundaries are IH 69/US 59, Preston Street, St. Joseph Parkway and Emancipation Avenue. Vietnamese street signs denote the area since 1998. In 2004, this area was officially named &quot;Little Saigon&quot; by the city of Houston. The redevelopment of Midtown Houston from run-down to upscale increased property values and property taxes, forcing many Vietnamese-American businesses out of the neighborhood into other areas.

The largest Vietnamese commercial district is now found in Houston (Alief), a strip along Bellaire Boulevard west of Chinatown, Houston, with most Vietnamese-owned businesses and restaurants centered at the Hong Kong City Mall on Bellaire and Boone (anchored by Hong Kong Food Market and Ocean Palace Restaurant).

Since the Vietnamese District is adjacent to Houston&#x27;s Chinatown, it is often confused to be part of the same neighborhood. The Vietnamese and the Chinese district are each their own individual neighborhood, however. Even though the area is primarily Vietnamese and Chinese, there is also a large number of Filipino Americans, Arab Muslims, Indonesian Americans, and Pakistani Americans in the area, as well as a sizable number of African Americans, whom were once the majority in the Little Saigon area prior to the Vietnam War.

====Dallas–Fort Worth (DFW)====
In addition to the ones listed here, several unofficial Little Saigons are located in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Dallas is also considered another one of the largest Vietnamese communities in the United States, along with its sister city, Fort Worth.
* One Little Saigon is located in Garland, along Walnut Street between Audelia Road and Jupiter Road. This one is the largest, consisting of four large supermarkets (Hiep Thai, New Truong Nguyen, Hong Kong, and Thuan Phat at Cali Saigon Mall in Garland). Each supermarket listed below is located in a different shopping complex and has a number of restaurants.
** Hiep Thai: northeast corner of Jupiter and Walnut.
** New Truong Nguyen: northwest corner of Jupiter and Walnut.
** Hong Kong: southwest corner of Audelia and Walnut.
** Thuan Phat Supermarket/Cali Saigon Mall: northeast corner of Jupiter Road and Beltline Road (in Garland borders with city of Richardson)
* The restaurants in the area are Bistro B, La Me, Doan, Pho 95, Pho Bang, SaiGon Kitchen, Nam Hua, Saigon Block, Pho Tay Do, Pho Que Huong, Pho Bac, Pho Pasteur, Huong Ly (in Richardson), and many more.
* Another one is located in Arlington, on Pioneer Parkway. This Little Saigon includes a couple supermarkets (New Market, Hong Kong, Hiep Thai, Central Market, May Hao Market), restaurants, Vietnamese Martyrs Catholic Church, which is the largest Vietnamese Catholic Church in the United States of America, and Vietnamese karaoke/café bars.
* The third one is in Irving on Beltline Road, with Little Saigon Mall. A small concentration of Vietnamese restaurants are being built on MacArthur and Beltline through Las Colinas and Valley Ranch. These restaurants are unique, infusing Korean, Japanese, Thai, Indian, and Chinese influences.
* There are also a number Vietnamese strip malls along Beltline in Carrollton. Though the area is predominantly Vietnamese, Chinese and Korean shops and churches can be found there, as well.
* Haltom City (on E Belknap Street) with many grocery stores, restaurants, and other stores.
Vietnamese businesses are also found in Richardson and Haltom City.

===Virginia===
Little Saigon, Arlington, in Clarendon, served as the Little Saigon of the Washington, D.C. region, reaching its heyday following the Fall of Saigon during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Many Vietnamese refugees immigrated to the area due to the proximity to the nation&#x27;s capital, and existing social, family, and business connections. This neighborhood was home to Vietnamese grocery stores, restaurants, department stores, cafes, and entertainment to serve the large Vietnamese population. Business was attractive to Vietnamese immigrants in this neighborhood due to the depressed rents during the time of construction of the WMATA Clarendon metro station. This neighborhood was a destination for Vietnamese immigrants both in the Washington D.C. area, as well as throughout the mid-Atlantic region.

The Washington, D.C., suburb of Seven Corners in Fairfax County, Virginia, is now home to the largest Vietnamese American population and cultural center on the eastern seaboard. While there is no full-fledged &quot;Little Saigon&quot; to speak of, the most prominent hub for local-area Vietnamese is the shopping mall called the Eden Center, complete with a garden and an arch signifying its entrance.

In Greater Richmond, the concentration of Vietnamese restaurants and shops near the intersection of Horsepen Road and West Broad Street is sometimes referred to as Little Saigon. This area of Western Henrico has developed as a center for the Vietnamese population since the late 1980s.

=== Washington ===

====Seattle====

Seattle has a significant, prosperous Vietnamese American business district centered at 12th Avenue and Jackson Street, immediately east of the city&#x27;s considerably older Chinatown district. This Vietnamese area has not been officially designated a &quot;Little Saigon&quot;, although a few street signs with this name have been erected. Rather, the area – along with the Chinatown district – has retained the longstanding name International District (now officially Chinatown/International District, but often just &quot;The I.D.&quot;), dating back to the late 1940s. The predominantly Chinese and predominantly Vietnamese areas are separated from one another by an Interstate 5 viaduct, but there is easy pedestrian and car access between the two.

====Tacoma====
Tacoma, as well, has an area commonly known as the &quot;Lincoln International District&quot;, which is almost entirely filled with Vietnamese restaurants, grocers, and shops. Though officially not known as &quot;Little Saigon&quot;, the area is normally referred to as such by the local resident population.

===Canada===
====Toronto====
Jane and Finch has a large Vietnamese population.

====Vancouver====
Vancouver and Richmond, British Columbia both have large Vietnamese populations, including in Vancouver&#x27;s Chinatown. The section of Kingsway between Fraser and Knight streets has been designated Vancouver&#x27;s Little Saigon since 2013.

==Locations in Europe and Australia==

===France===
In southern France, a &quot;Little Vietnam&quot; in Sainte-Livrade-sur-Lot which housed 1,160 Vietnamese refugees in a refugee camp faces demolition after being in existence since 1956. The location has long been in neglect; 120 families still live in shacks, many of whom are third and fourth generations of people affected by World War II.

In Paris, Vietnamese stores are concentrated in the 13th arrondissement and 5th arrondissement of Paris.

===Germany===
There is a large Vietnamese community in Germany, especially in former East Germany where the Vietnamese migrant workers first came in the 1970s. Berlin has the largest Vietnamese community with about 35,000 people of Vietnamese origin. Boroughs of Lichtenberg and Marzahn-Hellersdorf have the highest numbers of Vietnamese populations which were a part of East Berlin. The Dong Xuan Center in Lichtenberg is the largest Vietnamese market in Germany which offers many things from Vietnam including restaurants, shops, cafes and bars. Other German cities like Leipzig, Chemnitz and Hanover have also well known Vietnamese communities.

===Australia===
In Melbourne the suburb of Footscray has a large proportion of Vietnamese-Australians, the CBD of Footscray is often nicknamed Little Saigon. Other Vietnamese communities are centered around Springvale Road in Springvale, Victoria Street in Richmond, and St Albans.

<doc id="450108" wikidata="Q890010" url="?curid=450108" title="President of Sierra Leone">
<text>The president of the Republic of Sierra Leone is the head of state and the head of government of Sierra Leone, as well as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces.

As the head of the executive branch of the Sierra Leone government, the president implements laws passed by parliament. The president has influence especially over members of the party of the president in the legislative branch of Parliament. The president constitutionally appoints judges of the Sierra Leone Judicial branch, including judges of the high court, the court of appeals and the Supreme Court. The president heads a Cabinet of ministers, which must be approved by the Parliament. The president is the most powerful, and the most influential person in the Government of Sierra Leone. The president of Sierra Leone is formally addressed as His Excellency.

== Eligibility for Office of the President ==

* Sierra Leone citizen 
* Active membership in political party  
* Fulfills all other requirements to serve in parliament

* Current officeholder dies or retires from office  
* President participates in misconduct or is physically or mentally unable to complete the duties of the presidency  

During times of war, a president&#x27;s term may be extended beyond the pre-determined two five-year terms, but only in increments in half a year at any one time  

Resignations or retirements from the office of the presidency must be given in writing. Written resignations will be given to the Chief Justice. A copy of the resignation will be given to the Speaker and Chief Electoral Commissioner.  

Any factors resulting in vacancy of presidency will result in vice-president taking on duties of the presidency and finishing out the affected president&#x27;s term. Prior to beginning duties of the presidency, the vice-president shall take the proper oath as outlined in the Constitution of Sierra Leone.

* Head of state  
* Head of Executive branch  
* Head of Armed Forces 
* Head of Cabinet with Parliament approval

His address is known to be “His Excellency” and is a partnered appointee of Parliament.  

==Election==
The election is through a cycle of 5 consecutive years/terms. The president is elected by an absolute majority vote and has two different rounds in which he is elected through, but has to be met with a certain step by step criteria:  

* Appointed by his own political party  
* All voters and appointees be registered in Sierra Leone 
* Polls be taken on secret ballot at specific date and time by Parliament 
* Must result in one nomination of presidency  
* If nominee passes, party organizers have seven days exactly to nominate runner up 
* The poll majority must reach a 55% approval rating  
* If tied, the default of the election winner shall go to a second-round election within fourteen days.

The president&#x27;s election must take place during the state of his office, in which the former&#x27;s would be expired following a three-month period.  

As of 2021, there is a two-term limit for the president in the Constitution of Sierra Leone. The first president for whom the term limits applied was Kabbah in 2007.

== Benefits and Annual Pay ==
According to the Sierra Leone Constitution, the president receives entitlement and compensation salary within the office he upholds such as:  

* Receiving a salary and allowance as prescribed by Parliament and charged on a Consolidated Fund 
* Salary and allowances cannot be altered to a disadvantage or advantage  
* Exempted of personal taxes  
* Cannot be criminal charged while in office  
* Entitled to pension and retirement benefits prescribed by Parliament

== Administrative Powers ==

* With advice from the Judicial and Legal Service Commission, the president is able to appoint the members of the Judicature such as the Supreme Court&#x27;s chief justice 
* The president appoints the Ministers of State that make up the cabinet if they have been approved by the parliament  
* The president has the power to appoint numerous members of the government such as the members of the Judicature including the Supreme Court&#x27;s Chief Justice as well as other judges that make up the Judicature with the advisement of the advice of the Judicial and Legal Service Commission, and the Ministers of State. Though the president is able to appoint these positions, those appointed will still need to be approved by the parliament in order to hold those positions.

==Residence==
The President of Sierra Leone official and principal workplace is at State House, located in Tower Hill in central Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone.

The president of Sierra Leone has two official residences. The first is at State Lodge, located in the affluent neighborhood of Hill Station in the west end of Freetown; the second is at Kabassa Lodge, located in the affluent neighborhood of Juba Hill in the west end of Freetown.

The current president Julius Maada Wonie Bio uses the State Lodge at Hill Station as his official residence. The former president of Sierra Leone Ahmad Tejan Kabbah used State Lodge as his residence. Former Sierra Leone presidents Joseph Saidu Momoh and Siaka Stevens used the Kabassa Lodge at Juba Hill as their official residence.

==Security and protection==
The president of Sierra Leone is heavily guarded by the Presidential Guard, which is made up of a special unit of soldiers of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces and a special unit of police officers of the Operational Support Division of the Sierra Leone Police Force.

== Presidential Constitutional History ==
Siaska Stevens was representing the All People&#x27;s Congress (APC) party in 1967 when he won the general elections and became the Prime Minister. In 1971, the parliamentary system was abolished in favor of a presidential system. This adoption of a new constitution made Siaska Stevens the first executive President of Sierra Leone.  

Eventually, the APC would become the only recognized political party in the country. In 1978, a new constitution was adopted via referendum. This constitution replaced the multi-party system, instituting a single party state. Additionally, executive powers were increased and the presidential term limits increased from four to seven years.  

In October 1990, President Momoh appointed a thirty-five member National Constitutional Review Commission. This was in response to the growing opposition of a one-party state. The review commission recommends constitutional changes, providing alternatives to the one-party state.

<doc id="450113" wikidata="Q435126" url="?curid=450113" title="Georgia Byng">
<text>Lady Georgia Mary Caroline Byng (born 6 September 1965) is a British children&#x27;s writer, educator, illustrator, actress and film producer. Since 1995, she has published thirteen children&#x27;s books, and co-written and co-produced one film. Byng has won the Stockton Children&#x27;s Book Award, the Sheffield Children&#x27;s Book Award, the Massachusetts Children&#x27;s Book Award, the Salford Children&#x27;s Book Award and the Best Kid&#x27;s Film at the Peace And Love Festival, Sweden. Most of Byng&#x27;s books are magical realism adventures, with protagonists who overcome self-doubt and become self-empowered. The themes are often bullying and its darkness, kindness and its light, friendship and its warmth, and the power of the mind.

==Early life==
Georgia Byng was born on 6 September 1965, at her family&#x27;s home in London, the elder daughter and second child of Thomas Edmund Byng, Viscount Enfield (later the 8th Earl of Strafford) and his first wife, Jennifer May (daughter of Irish politician William Morrison May). She grew up in a village, Abbots Worthy, near the city of Winchester in Hampshire. She has three brothers and one sister. Byng is the elder sister of Jamie Byng, publisher of Canongate Books. Through her late stepfather, Sir Christopher Bland, Byng is the half-sister of Archie Bland, &quot;Guardian&quot; writer and sub-editor.

Byng was educated at Princess Mead School and Nethercliffe School, Winchester, then from the age of 12 at Westonbirt School, an independent boarding school for girls in Gloucestershire. She went to Peter Symonds, a sixth-form college in Winchester. From 1984 to 1987, she attended the Central School of Speech and Drama, a constituent college of the University of London in central London.

==Career==
===Acting===
Byng worked as an actress from 1989 to 1990, appearing in the television series &quot;Screen Two&quot;, &quot;Dealers&quot;, and &quot;Capstick&#x27;s Law&quot;.

===Writing and illustration===
Byng&#x27;s first published book was a comic-strip story that she wrote and illustraited – &quot;The Sock Monsters,&quot; about the small monsters who live in houses and eat people&#x27;s socks. She followed this with &quot;Jack&#x27;s Tree&quot;, a comic-strip book about a boy who saves a tree from being cut down. Her next book was &quot;The Ramsbottom Rumble&quot;, a short novel about two boys who save their grandmother from a con man. 

Byng&#x27;s best-known work is &quot;Molly Moon&#x27;s Incredible Book of Hypnotism&quot;, a children&#x27;s novel about a girl who finds a hypnotism book in the library and learns how to hypnotise people. This book was followed by &quot;Molly Moon’s Hypnotic Holiday&quot;, then &quot;Molly Moon Stops the World&quot; in which Molly learns how to stop time. In the next book, &quot;Molly Moon&#x27;s Time Travel Adventure&quot;, Molly gets the gist of time travelling. In &quot;Molly Moon, Micky Minus and the Mind Machine&quot; she becomes a mind reader. In &quot;Molly Moon and the Morphing Mystery&quot; Molly uses her powers to morph into other forms, both people and animals. In the seventh Molly Moon book, &quot;Molly Moon and The Monster Music&quot;, Molly finds she is able to hypnotise people and animals by playing hypnotic music. Each of the Molly Moon series is set in a different place, from the UK to New York, to Los Angeles, then India (this one in the 19th century) to Switzerland in the future to Ecuador and Japan. Byng co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;Molly Moon and the Incredible Book of Hypnotism&quot;, the movie of her first book. 

After the Molly Moon books came &quot;Pancake Face&quot;, and &quot;The Girl with No Nose&quot;, and in January 2023, &quot;Albi, the Glowing Cow Boy&quot;, an illustrated novel for 8- to 12-year-olds about a calf who eats big white milk mushrooms, then becomes super-intelligent and escapes an abattoir. Like Byng&#x27;s other books, this book travels across the world. Its protagonist, Albi champions compassion towards other beings and plant-based eating and this being a solution to climate change. Byng is with Caradoc King and Millie Hoskins at London literary agency United Agents.

===Production===
In 2015, Byng was the producer for &quot;Molly Moon and the Incredible Book of Hypnotism&quot;, the film adaptation of her book.

==Personal life==
Byng married Daniel Chadwick in 1990; they divorced in 1995. They have a daughter.

Byng married artist Marc Quinn. They divorced in 2014. They have two sons.

Byng is now engaged to musician, Guy Pratt.

==Geography==
In the east, Mokhotlong borders on the KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa, with its north point bordering the Free State Province. Domestically, it borders on the following districts, namely, Butha-Buthe District in northwest, Leribe District in west, and Thaba-Tseka District in the south. It is traversed by the northwesterly line of equal latitude and longitude. The Eastern districts of Lesotho has predominantly low land zone with an elevation of above the sea level. These lands are not the major agricultural zones in the country, compared to the Western counterparts. The average annual rainfall in the country is , most of which is received during the rainy season of October to April. Though it rains during all the months of the year, groundwater is limited on account of run-offs. The region has a temperate climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;) on account of the elevation and is humid during most parts of the year. The temperature in low lands vary from to in the winter.

==Administration==
Constituencies of Mokhotlong District include Bobatsi, Malingoaneng, Mokhotlong and Senqu. The community councils of Mokhotlong District are Seate, Mphokojoane, Menoaneng, Sanqebethu and Mokhotlong Urban Council. As per the 1968 Local Government Repeal Act - Development Committees Order No.9 of 1986, a District Development Committee (DDC) should have a set of Ward Development Committees (WDC) for each ward and Village Development Committees (VDC) under it. Each VDC has a set of seven elected members and the head would be an ex-officio member and chairman of the committee. The WDC is composed of twelve members elected from about VDCs, whose chairman serves as an ex-officio member. The fifteen-membered DDC is elected by the members of WDC. When there are cases of more than one DDC, the chiefs would alternate in meetings. The district secretary co-ordinates the activities of the various committees. As per the Local Government Amendment Act 2004, the District Development Coordination Committee was established as the supreme body of district administration, under which all the district councils were branched. The urban and municipal councils were under each district council, which in turn had community councils under it.

The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) is responsible for the administration of the Local Government Elections. The nation&#x27;s first local government elections were conducted in April 2005, while the most recent elections were held in October 2011. During these elections, 64 community councils, 11 urban councils and one municipal council were elected.

<doc id="450115" wikidata="Q2118043" url="?curid=450115" title="Skipjack-class submarine">
<text>The &quot;Skipjack&quot; class was a class of United States Navy nuclear submarines (SSNs) that entered service from 1959 to 1961. This class was named after its lead boat, . The new class introduced the teardrop hull and the S5W reactor to U.S. nuclear submarines. The &quot;Skipjack&quot;s were the fastest U.S. nuclear submarines until the s, the first of which entered service in 1974.

==Design==

The &quot;Skipjack&quot;s&#x27; design (project SCB 154) was based on the USS &quot;Albacore&quot;&#x27;s high-speed hull design. The hull and innovative internal arrangement were similar to the diesel-powered &quot;Barbel&quot; class that were built concurrently. The design of the &quot;Skipjack&quot;s was very different from the s that preceded the &quot;Skipjack&quot;s. Unlike the &quot;Skate&quot;s, this new design was maximized for underwater speed by fully streamlining the hull like a blimp. This required a single screw aft of the rudders and stern planes. Adoption of a single screw was a matter of considerable debate and analysis within the Navy, as two shafts offered redundancy and improved maneuverability. The so-called &quot;body-of-revolution hull&quot; reduced her surface sea-keeping, but was essential for underwater performance. Also like &quot;Albacore&quot;, the &quot;Skipjack&quot;s used HY-80 high-strength steel, with a yield strength of , although this was not initially used to increase the diving depth relative to other US submarines. HY-80 remained the standard submarine steel through the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; class.
Another &quot;Barbel&quot;-like innovation was the combination of the conning tower, control room, and attack center in one space. This was continued in all subsequent US nuclear submarines. Combining the functions in one space was facilitated by the adoption of &quot;push-button&quot; ballast control, another feature of &quot;Albacore&quot;. Previous designs had routed the trim system piping through the control room, where the valves were manually operated. The &quot;push-button&quot; system used hydraulic operators on each valve, remotely electrically operated (actually via toggle switches) from the control room. This greatly conserved control room space and reduced the time required to conduct trim operations. The overall layout made coordination of the weapons and ship control systems easier during combat operations.
Much of the overall internal arrangement was continued in the subsequent &quot;Thresher&quot;- and &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class submarines. The &quot;Skipjack&quot;s&#x27; five compartments were called the Torpedo Room, Operations Compartment, Reactor Compartment, Auxiliary Machinery Space (AMS), and Engine Room. With the addition of a missile compartment, the arrangement of the first 41 US nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) was similar. The design was primarily single-hull, with a double hull around the torpedo room and AMS for ballast tanks. The design was improved on the &quot;Thresher&quot;s, the one-off , and subsequent attack submarines by relocating the torpedo room into the operations compartment via angled midships torpedo tubes to make room for a large sonar sphere in the bow. The &quot;George Washington&quot; class, the first SSBNs, were derived from the &quot;Skipjack&quot;s, with rebuilt from the incomplete first . The hull of &quot;Scorpion&quot; was laid down twice, as the original hull was redesigned to become the &quot;George Washington&quot;. Also, the material for building was diverted into building , which delayed &quot;Scamp&quot;″s progress.

The bow planes were moved to the massive sail to cut down on flow-induced noise near the bow sonar arrays. They were known as sail planes (fairwater planes). The &quot;Skipjack&quot;s were the first class built with sail planes; they were later backfitted on the &quot;Barbel&quot;s. This design feature would be repeated on all U.S. nuclear submarines until the improved , the first of which was launched in 1988. The small &quot;turtleback&quot; behind the sail was the exhaust piping of the auxiliary diesel generator.

The &quot;Skipjack&quot;s also introduced the S5W reactor to U.S. nuclear submarines. It was known as ASFR (Advanced Submarine Fleet Reactor) during development. The S5W was used on 98 U.S. nuclear submarines of 8 classes and the first British nuclear submarine, , making it the most-used US Navy reactor design to date.

The design of the prototype HMS Dreadnought is closely related to the Skipjack class. The entire aft section of HMS Dreadnought was identical to the Skipjack class as the hull was built around the reactor and could not be changed but the fore section was based on earlier British studies into nuclear submarine design, great care had to be taken to marry the two designs alignment.

==Service==
&quot;Skipjack&quot; was authorized in the FY 1956 new construction program and commissioned in April 1959. Each hull cost around $40 million. &quot;Skipjack&quot; was certified as the &quot;world&#x27;s fastest submarine&quot; after initial sea trials in March 1959, although the actual speed attained was classified. The &quot;Skipjack&quot;s remained the fastest US nuclear-powered submarines until the first of the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; class entered service in 1974. This was due to the increased size of the &quot;Thresher&quot; and &quot;Sturgeon&quot; classes, which retained &quot;Skipjack&quot;″s S5W power plant, plus the introduction of the &quot;skewback&quot; screw, which was quiet but mechanically inefficient. The &quot;Skipjack&quot;s saw service during the Vietnam War and most of the Cold War. The &quot;Skipjack&quot;-class submarines were withdrawn from service in the late 1980s and early 1990s except for , which sank on 22 May 1968 southwest of the Azores while returning from a Mediterranean deployment, with all 99 crewmembers lost.

<text>This article lists the heads of state of Sudan since the country&#x27;s independence in 1956.

==History of the office==
Since independence was proclaimed on 1 January 1956, six individuals (and three multi-member sovereignty councils) have served as head of state of Sudan, currently under the title President of the Republic of the Sudan. Prior to independence, Sudan was governed as a condominium by Egypt and the United Kingdom, under the name Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. As such, executive power was vested in a dyarchy consisting of both countries&#x27; heads of state – at the time of independence, the Queen of the United Kingdom (Elizabeth II) and the Egyptian Revolutionary Command Council (headed by Gamal Abdel Nasser). Immediately following independence, the role of head of state was filled by a five-member Sovereignty Council, with rival nationalist factions unable to agree on a single candidate. In November 1958, General Ibrahim Abboud led a military coup d&#x27;état, assuming the role of head of state as Chairman of the Supreme Council. Assuming the title of president in 1964, he resigned later that year due to general discontent around the rule of the military regime. Abboud was succeeded by a senior civil servant, Sirr Al-Khatim Al-Khalifa, who served as acting president for 18 days before transferring executive authority to a Committee of Sovereignty.

Ismail al-Azhari, the leader of the National Unionist Party, was made president in July 1965; he ruled with limited power until he was deposed in a 1969 military coup. The military officers responsible for the coup established the National Revolutionary Command Council, chaired by Jaafar Nimeiry. Nimeiry, the leader of the newly formed Sudanese Socialist Union, assumed the position of president in 1971, and subsequently established a one-party state, which existed until 1985, when a group of military officers overthrew his government and established the 1985 Transitional Military Council, led by Field Marshal Abdel Rahman Swar al-Dahab. Ahmed al-Mirghani succeeded to the relatively powerless position of Chairman of the Supreme Council in 1986, after multi-party election held that year. He was deposed in a 1989 military coup led by Lieutenant-General Omar al-Bashir. Al-Bashir served as head of state, under the title of Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation from 1989 to 1993 and as president from 1993 to 2019 (and from 1996 as the leader of the National Congress Party). 

Al-Bashir was removed from power by the Sudanese Armed Forces on 11 April 2019, amid the Sudanese Revolution after holding the office for nearly 30 years. Lieutenant-General Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf took control of Sudan without becoming head of state, established the 2019 Transitional Military Council, but resigned the following day in favor of Lieutenant-General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. The Transitional Military Council was replaced with the Transitional Sovereignty Council on 20 August 2019, under the chairmanship of al-Burhan. The Sovereignty Council, an 11-member civilian-military collective head of state, is designed to lead the country for 39 months in the transition to democracy, which is supposed to end with the next general election. The Transitional Sovereignty Council was dissolved by al-Burhan on 25 October 2021, following a coup d&#x27;état. Al-Burhan reinstated it on 11 November 2021, with some members replaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;al Jazeera 11/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="450129" wikidata="Q2475058" url="?curid=450129" title="List of sultans of Zanzibar">
<text>The sultans of Zanzibar (; ) were the rulers of the Sultanate of Zanzibar, which was created on 19 October 1856 after the death of Said bin Sultan. He had ruled Oman and Zanzibar as the sultan of Oman since 1804. The sultans of Zanzibar were of a cadet branch of the Al Said Dynasty of Oman.

In 1698, Zanzibar became part of the overseas holdings of Oman, falling under the control of the sultan of Oman. Omani and other Arab traders had already been prominent in trade with the island for hundreds of years. It was also visited by traders from Persia and India, who arrived with the seasonal &quot;musim&quot; (west wind). Months later they could return east with a change in the wind.

In 1832 or 1840 (the date varies among sources), Said bin Sultan moved his capital from Muscat in Oman to Stone Town on Zanzibar. He established a ruling Arab elite and encouraged the development of clove plantations, using the island&#x27;s enslaved black Africans as labourers. 

Zanzibar&#x27;s commerce fell increasingly into the hands of traders from the Indian subcontinent, whom Said encouraged to settle on the island. Traders had been coming to the island from Persia, Arabia, and India for hundreds of years. After Said&#x27;s death in 1856, two of his sons, Majid bin Said and Thuwaini bin Said, struggled over the succession. They divided Zanzibar and Oman into two separate principalities; Thuwaini became the sultan of Oman and Majid, the first sultan of Zanzibar. 

During his 14-year reign as sultan, Majid consolidated his power around the East African slave trade. His successor, Barghash bin Said, helped abolish the slave trade in Zanzibar and is credited with developing the country&#x27;s infrastructure. The third sultan, Khalifa bin Said, also furthered the country&#x27;s progress toward abolishing slavery.

Until 1886, the sultan of Zanzibar also controlled a substantial portion of the east African coast, known as Zanj, and trading routes that extended further into the continent, as far as Kindu on the Congo River. That year, the British and Germans secretly met and re-established the area under the sultan&#x27;s rule. 

Over the next few years, European imperial powers took over most of the mainland possessions of the Sultanate. With the signing of the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty in 1890 during Ali bin Said&#x27;s reign, Zanzibar became a British protectorate. In August 1896, Britain and Zanzibar fought a 38-minute war, the shortest in recorded history, after Khalid bin Barghash had taken power following Hamid bin Thuwaini&#x27;s death. 

The British had wanted Hamoud bin Mohammed to become sultan, believing that he would be much easier to work with. The British gave Khalid an hour to vacate the sultan&#x27;s palace in Stone Town. Khalid failed to do so, and instead assembled an army of 2,800 men to fight the British. The British launched an attack on the palace and other locations around the city. Khalid retreated and later went into exile. The British installed Hamoud as sultan.

Khalid bin Harub became Sultan of Zanzibar in late 1911; he served until his death in October 1960.

In December 1963, Zanzibar was granted independence by the United Kingdom and became a constitutional monarchy within the Commonwealth under the sultan. Sultan Jamshid bin Abdullah was overthrown a month later during the Zanzibar Revolution. Jamshid fled into exile, and the Sultanate was replaced by the People&#x27;s Republic of Zanzibar and Pemba, a government dominated by Africans. 

In April 1964, the republic was united with Tanganyika to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar. This was renamed as Tanzania six months later.

==Footnotes==

* Majid bin Said, the youngest son of Said bin Sultan, became the Sultan of Oman after his father&#x27;s death on 19 October 1856. However, Majid&#x27;s elder brother, Thuwaini bin Said, contested the accession to power. Following a struggle over the position, it was decided that Zanzibar and Oman would be divided into two separate principalities. Majid would rule as the Sultan of Zanzibar while Thuwaini would rule as the Sultan of Oman.
* From 1886, the United Kingdom and Germany had plotted to obtain parts of the Zanzibar Sultanate for their own empires. In October 1886, a German-British border commission established the Zanj as a 10 nautical mile (19 km) wide strip along most of the coast of East Africa, stretching from Cape Delgado (now in Mozambique) to Kipini (now in Kenya), including Mombasa and Dar es Salaam. Over the next few years, almost all of these mainland possessions were lost to European imperial powers.
* Hamoud bin Mohammed, the son-in-law of Majid bin Said, was supposed to become the Sultan of Zanzibar after Hamid bin Thuwayni&#x27;s death. However, Khalid bin Bhargash, son of Bargash bin Said, seized the Sultan&#x27;s palace and declared himself the ruler of Zanzibar. The British, who had supported Hamoud, responded on 26 August by issuing an ultimatum to Khalid and his men to leave the palace within one hour. After he refused, the Royal Navy began firing at the palace and other locations in Stone Town. Khalid assembled an army of 2,800 and stationed them all around the town. Thirty-eight minutes later, Khalid retreated to the German consulate, where he was granted asylum. This conflict, known as the Anglo-Zanzibar War, was the shortest war in recorded history. Khalid later went into exile in Dar es Salaam until being captured by the British in 1916.
*After attending the coronation of King George V, Ali decided to abdicate from the throne to live in Europe.
* Abdullah bin Khalifah died from complications of diabetes.
* Jamshid bin Abdullah overthrown on 12 January 1964 during the Zanzibar Revolution. Jamshid managed to flee to Great Britain with his family and ministers.

<doc id="450134" wikidata="Q866730" url="?curid=450134" title="List of presidents of Togo">
<text>This is a list of presidents of Togo since the formation of the post of president in 1960, to the present day.

A total of four people have served as president (not counting one acting president and two interim military officeholders). Additionally, one person, Faure Gnassingbé, the current president, has served on two non-consecutive occasions: first from the death of his father, Gnassingbé Eyadema, on 5 February 2005 until his resignation 20 days later on 25 February and the second one since 4 May 2005.

Togo has, for most of its independence, had a presidential system in which the president was not only the head of state, but also the head of government and that the role had much power over both domestic and foreign policy. However, constitutional reforms adopted in April 2024 reduced the president&#x27;s powers, made the role more ceremonial, and moved the country towards a more parliamentary system. While the role became ceremonial, the president is still the commander-in-chief of the Togolese Armed Forces and still has the power to appoint or dismiss the prime minister. The reform also changed the way the president is elected, from being directly elected by citizens to being indirectly elected by the National Assembly.

==Description of the office==

===Election===
The president of the Republic is elected by universal, direct and secret suffrage for a mandate of five years.

He is re-eligible. As of 2021, there is a two-term limit for the president in the Constitution of Togo which was reinstated in 2019. This limit has been lifted for Gnassingbé Eyadéma in 2002 and for Faure Gnassingbé in 2019. 

The election of the president of the Republic takes place by uninominal majority ballot in one round.

The president of the Republic is elected with the majority of the suffrage expressed.

The vote is opened on convocation of the electoral body by decree taken in the Council of Ministers 60 days at least and 75 days at most before the expiration of the mandate of the president in office.

No one may be a candidate for the office of the president of the Republic if they:

:# are not exclusively of Togolese nationality by birth;
:# are not 35 years of age on the date of the deposit of the candidature;
:# do not enjoy all their civil and political rights;
:# do not present a general state of physical and mental well-being duly declared by three sworn physicians, designated by the Constitutional Court;
:# do not reside in the national territory for at least 12 months.

The president of the Republic enters office within 15 days which follows the proclamation of the results of the presidential election. 

However, following the constitutional reform in 2024, the election system has changed which means that the president is now indirectly elected by the National Assembly.

===Oath of office===
Before he enters into office, the president of the Republic swears before the Constitutional Court meeting in solemn hearing, in these terms:

===Vacancy===
In case of a vacancy of the presidency of the Republic by death, resignation or definitive incapacity, the presidential function is exercised provisionally by the president of the National Assembly.

The vacancy is declared by the Constitutional Court referred to [the matter] by the Government.

The Government convokes the electoral body within sixty (60) days of the opening of the vacancy for the election of a new president of the Republic.

==Residences==
After independence, the President of Togo used the Palace of the Governors as an office and residence. The Palace was formerly used by both German and French colonial administrators. In 1970, President Gnassingbé Eyadéma moved into a new Presidential Palace built near the Palace of the Governors. Another residence used by the Gnassingbé Eyadéma was the Presidential Residence of Lomé II. In 2006, a new Presidential Palace, financed by China, was inaugurated by President Faure Gnassingbé on the outskirts of Lomé.

<doc id="450141" wikidata="Q741042" url="?curid=450141" title="Panic Room">
<text>Panic Room is a 2002 American thriller film directed by David Fincher. The film stars Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart as a mother and daughter whose new home is invaded by burglars, played by Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam. The script was written by David Koepp, whose screenplay was inspired by news coverage in 2000 about panic rooms.

The film was Fincher&#x27;s fifth feature film, following &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999). Fincher and Koepp brought together a crew of people with whom each had worked with before. The house and its panic room were built on a Raleigh Studios lot. Nicole Kidman was originally cast as the mother, but she left after aggravating a previous injury. Her departure threatened the completion of the film, but Foster quickly replaced Kidman. The filmmakers used computer-generated imagery to create the illusion of the film camera moving through the house&#x27;s rooms. Foster became pregnant during the shooting schedule, so filming was suspended until after she gave birth. The film&#x27;s production cost .

The film was commercially released in the United States and Canada on , 2002. The film grossed on its opening weekend. In the United States and Canada, it grossed . In other territories, it grossed for a worldwide total of . The film was positively reviewd by critics, who commended Fincher&#x27;s direction and Foster&#x27;s performance. &quot;Panic Room&quot; has been analyzed for its exploration of gender and feminism, as well as its portrayal of surveillance technologies, diabetes, and mortality. The film has also been critiqued for its depictions of domesticity, race, real estate, ecological anxieties, and its thematic engagement with existential dread.

==Plot==
Recently divorced Meg Altman and her eleven-year-old daughter, Sarah, move into a four-story brownstone in New York City&#x27;s Upper West Side. The house&#x27;s previous owner, a reclusive millionaire, had installed a &quot;panic room&quot; to protect himself from intruders. The room is reinforced with concrete and steel and features a thick steel door. It also includes an extensive security system with multiple surveillance cameras and a public address system.

On Meg and Sarah&#x27;s first night in the house, three men break in: Junior, the previous owner&#x27;s grandson; Burnham, an employee of the home&#x27;s security company; and Raoul, a thug recruited by Junior. They intend to steal bearer bonds locked inside a floor safe in the panic room.

When Meg wakes during the night, she sees the men on the security cameras and rushes to the panic room with Sarah. To force them out, the men pump propane gas into the room&#x27;s air vents. Meg ignites the gas while she and Sarah cover themselves with fireproof blankets; the ignited propane leaves Junior badly burned. Meg taps into the main telephone line and calls her ex-husband, Stephen. As she tries to explain their situation, the intruders cut the line, ending the call.

When all attempts to breach the room fail, Junior gives up on the robbery but lets slip that there is more money in the safe than he initially disclosed. When he tries to leave, Raoul fatally shoots him and forces Burnham to continue with the robbery. Stephen arrives and is immediately taken hostage. Raoul severely beats him, ensuring that Meg sees it on the security camera. Sarah, a diabetic, suffers a seizure as her glucagon syringes are in her bedroom.

Raoul tricks Meg into thinking it is safe to temporarily leave the panic room. When she leaves to retrieve Sarah&#x27;s medication, the men enter the room with Sarah inside. Meg throws the med kit in just as Burnham closes the door, inadvertently crushing Raoul&#x27;s hand. She pleads with the men to give Sarah her medication, which Burnham eventually does. Two police officers arrive at the house, following up on Stephen&#x27;s earlier 911 call and complaints from the neighbors. To protect Sarah, Meg convinces the officers that everything is fine, and they leave. Meanwhile, Burnham opens the safe and finds $22 million in bearer bonds inside.

As the men prepare to leave with Sarah as a hostage, Meg leads them into an ambush, using a sledgehammer to knock Raoul over a banister and into a stairwell. As Burnham flees, the injured Raoul crawls back up and overpowers Meg, preparing to bludgeon her with the sledgehammer. Hearing Sarah&#x27;s terrified screams, Burnham rushes back and shoots Raoul, killing him. The police, alerted by Meg&#x27;s earlier odd behavior, return in force and apprehend Burnham.

A few days later, Meg and Sarah search the newspaper for a new, smaller home, having recovered from their ordeal.

==Cast==

Jodie Foster stars as Meg Altman, a recently divorced woman who, with her daughter Sarah, looks for a new home in New York City. Nicole Kidman was originally cast as Meg, but she left the project due to a knee injury. Foster, who almost joined the cast of Fincher&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;The Game&quot;, replaced Kidman. Fincher said Kidman&#x27;s portrayal was &quot;about glamour and physicality&quot;, while Foster&#x27;s portrayal was &quot;more political&quot;. Meg was originally written to be helpless, but with Foster&#x27;s involvement, the character was revised to be stronger. The casting change also led to Meg&#x27;s character being rewritten to be similar to her daughter, whereas Meg had been different from her before. Foster became pregnant soon after she started filming. She told the filmmakers, and they decided to keep filming her scenes but with a wardrobe that would conceal her pregnancy. Studio executives did not like the dailies and suspended production until Foster gave birth and returned to perform re-shoots. Foster was reportedly paid for her role.

Kristen Stewart stars as Sarah, Meg&#x27;s diabetic daughter. Hayden Panettiere was originally cast as Sarah, but when she left the project toward the end of 2000, Stewart was cast in the role. &quot;Panic Room&quot; was Stewart&#x27;s second feature film after &quot;The Safety of Objects&quot; (2001). When Kidman was cast as Meg, Fincher said Stewart was &quot;to complement [Kidman&#x27;s portrayal], to be her antithesis, tomboyish, androgynous, dismissive, a teenager at ten years old. It was about the daughter being a parent to her mother.&quot; When Foster replaced Kidman, the character Meg was rewritten so she and Sarah would be similar.

Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam star as the film&#x27;s burglars, Burnham, Junior, and Raoul, respectively. Whitaker&#x27;s character Burnham was originally written to be &quot;a slick, technical type&quot; and the designer of the panic room in Meg and Sarah&#x27;s home. Fincher did not think a designer could be persuaded to break into a home, so he rewrote the character to be a blue-collar worker who installs panic rooms for a living. The director told Whitaker to watch &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948) and to emulate Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s character. Whitaker said he liked Burnham&#x27;s &quot;conflicted&quot; nature and preferred it to Raoul&#x27;s villainy. Raoul was originally written to be &quot;a giant scary hulking guy&quot;, but Fincher rewrote him to be &quot;this wiry, mean kind of ex-con white trash guy&quot;. In one revised instance, Raoul punches Meg instead of slapping her to be reinforced as &quot;an appalling character&quot;. The role of Raoul was originally offered to Maynard James Keenan, whom Fincher had directed in a music video for A Perfect Circle&#x27;s &quot;Judith&quot;. Keenan was too busy as the singer for Tool, so Fincher then offered the role to Yoakam, knowing him from his performance in &quot;Sling Blade&quot; (1996). For the role of Junior, Fincher cast Leto, who was in the cast of Fincher&#x27;s previous film &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999). As part of atypical class division, Junior is &quot;the uptown rich kid&quot;, where Burnham is blue-collar, and Raoul is undefinable.

Patrick Bauchau had a minor role as Meg&#x27;s ex-husband Stephen. Kidman, though she left the primary role due to her knee injury, had an uncredited off-screen role as the voice of Stephen&#x27;s supermodel girlfriend. Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker, who contributed as writer for several of Fincher&#x27;s previous films, had a cameo in &quot;Panic Room&quot; as a sleepy neighbor.

==Crew==
&quot;Panic Room&quot;″s crew includes:

* David Fincher – director
* David Koepp – screenwriter, producer
* Ceán Chaffin – producer
* Judy Hofflund – producer
* Gavin Polone – producer
* Howard Shore – composer
* Conrad W. Hall – cinematographer
* Darius Khondji – cinematographer
* James Haygood – editor
* Angus Wall – editor
* Arthur Max – production designer
* Keith Neely – art director
* James E. Tocci – art director
* Jon Danniells – set decorator
* Garrett Lewis – set decorator
* Michael Kaplan – costume designer

==Production==

&quot;Panic Room&quot; was directed by David Fincher based on a screenplay written by David Koepp. The film, produced at Columbia Pictures, was Fincher&#x27;s fifth feature film, following &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999). Koepp was also a producer for &quot;Panic Room&quot;, and he was joined by Judy Hofflund and Gavin Polone, with whom he collaborated on &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot; (1999). Fincher included as producer Ceán Chaffin, with whom he had worked on commercials and music videos. Fincher also included in his initial crew people with whom he had worked before: cinematographer Darius Khondji, production designer Arthur Max, costume designer Michael Kaplan, and editors James Haygood and Angus Wall.

Fincher envisioned &quot;Panic Room&quot; as a about survival. His previous film &quot;Fight Club&quot; had 400 scenes and 100 locations, so he wanted to simplify the production of &quot;Panic Room&quot;. To this end, he wanted to focus production on a single set and to plan the scenes and shots thoroughly before the start of filming. Despite the preparation, he experienced difficulty in production with changes in the cast and the crew as well as the inherent inflexibility of his initial planning.

===Development===
Screenwriter David Koepp was inspired by news coverage in 2000 about how safe rooms were becoming prevalent among the wealthy living in urban areas. He sold the script to Sony Pictures for . Before Fincher&#x27;s involvement, director Ridley Scott was briefly connected to the project, and actor-director Forest Whitaker studied the script before declining the opportunity to direct. Fincher said he was interested in the script&#x27;s omniscience and that he was reminded of &quot;the specific subjectivity&quot; of &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954). He also saw &quot;Panic Room&quot; as a cross between &quot;Rear Window&quot; and &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; (1971), though he was concerned &quot;a modern audience&quot; would compare &quot;Panic Room&quot; more to &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990) than to &quot;Rear Window&quot;.

Fincher also saw &quot;Panic Room&quot; as a crime thriller similar to &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; (1948), where money is &quot;an object that everyone&#x27;s after for the wrong reasons&quot;. The director was also interested in the story&#x27;s conciseness of happening in one place and in one night, and how the screenplay was well-laid out to let the director decide a variety of shots and use of set-pieces. Fincher also saw the project as a way to be &quot;in lock-step with the audience&quot; in a change of pace from his previous films.

Koepp&#x27;s screenplay emphasized pace over exposition. Koepp and Fincher agreed to streamline the film so the opening would introduce the characters as soon as possible. Fincher also sought to lay out the film so audiences could see characters make plans and thus be ahead of them, calling the tense foresight &quot;a very cinematic notion&quot;. He wanted to track the different characters&#x27; agendas and to also keep scenes chronological, so he set up &quot;computer-generated motion-control shots&quot; to move the camera around the set. He planned scenes in which parallel scenes could be seen through the panic room&#x27;s video monitors and also intercut between different characters. The final screenplay was similar in outline to the original one; there were minor changes in dialogue and specific moments, especially in the interaction between Meg and Sarah Altman due to Foster replacing Kidman. Explicit mention of Sarah&#x27;s diabetes, such as the emergency syringe containing glucagon, were removed from the dialogue. Careful beverage intake, refrigerated medicine bottles, and Sarah&#x27;s glucometer watch were intended as evidence of her diabetes.

===Pre-production===
The house was built on a soundstage on a Raleigh Studios lot. The set was designed by production designer Arthur Max, and it cost to build. The panic room was by . Three versions of the room were built so Fincher could film scenes from multiple angles. A 3D computer model of the set on the soundstage was designed. Fincher, who had done pre-visualization for &quot;Fight Club&quot;, used the model to design shots and decide their sequence. The computer model also enabled the camera to have &quot;total freedom to travel&quot; inside the house. Fincher said, &quot;What we were just trying to do with CG was to say, there&#x27;s no camera operator, there&#x27;s no crew, there&#x27;s no track, and the camera can go everywhere.&quot; The crew applied photogrammetry—&quot;mapping still images over the surface of computer-generated &#x27;sets&#x27;&quot;. The filming schedule was also shortened since camera setups could be evaluated and discarded virtually. Fincher had two-thirds of &quot;Panic Room&quot;″s shots planned before the start of filming. Director Steven Soderbergh reviewed Fincher&#x27;s test footage and warned him that excessive planning would make actual production difficult for him and his crew.

Fincher sought to light his film less than most other films; he believed darkness contributed to the scare factor. Entering production, he initially planned to film the first half of the film in near-total darkness but decided that it required too much patience from audiences. Instead, he chose a &quot;shadowy ambience&quot; as a backdrop for Meg and Sarah Altman.

===Filming===

Casting began in 2000, with Nicole Kidman and Hayden Panettiere cast as Meg and Sarah Altman, the film&#x27;s mother and daughter. Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam were also cast as the film&#x27;s burglars. In December 2000, before the start of filming, Panettiere left the project, and was replaced by Kristen Stewart. Filming began in January 2001. Shortly after the start of filming, cinematographer Darius Khondji was fired from the film. Khondji said he was fired after a conflict with a crew member that he did not want to name, but David Fincher said he and Khondji could not agree &quot;on aspects of production&quot;. Much of the film was already planned in pre-production, and Khondji could not be given flexibility. Fincher replaced Khondji with Conrad W. Hall, with whom he found &quot;a balance&quot;. Khondji said he supported Hall as his replacement.

After two weeks of filming, at the end of January 2001, Kidman was injured on set. An x-ray revealed a hairline fracture underneath one of her knee joints. The fracture was an injury from Kidman&#x27;s filming of &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (2001), and the fracture had never fully healed. When Kidman left the project, Fincher continued filming scenes that did not include her character. During the same time of Kidman&#x27;s departure, the Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild were threatening to strike over contractual disputes, so Fincher was pressured to re-cast the role of Meg Altman before it took place. Since the film was early in production, Fincher was ready to shut down, but the studio wanted to continue production and find a replacement. If the studio had shut down production permanently, it would have collected from insurance. If production was shut down then restarted, it would cost the studio , necessitating a quick replacement for Kidman. Rumored actors included Sandra Bullock, Angelina Jolie, and Robin Wright. Jodie Foster was previously occupied with directing duties of &quot;Flora Plum&quot; before its star Russell Crowe was injured and left the project, leading to that production&#x27;s shutdown. To join &quot;Panic Room&quot;, Foster also stepped down as head of the awards jury at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. Foster had a week to prepare for her role before filming resumed.

Five weeks after Foster began filming &quot;Panic Room&quot;, she learned she was pregnant. She informed Fincher and his producer Chaffin of her pregnancy, and they decided to continue filming. Fincher did not want to rush production, so Foster changed her wardrobe from a tank top to a heavy sweater to disguise indications of her pregnancy. For action scenes, stunt double Jill Stokesberry replaced Foster.

In the film&#x27;s progression, the house degrades in quality, so Fincher filmed scenes in continuity as the set changed. He also filmed many sequences twice due to their near-parallel appearance on the panic room&#x27;s video monitors. Editor Wall said there were for the film with most set-ups having two cameras. One repeated take was when Raoul attempts to break into the panic room through the plaster ceiling below it. The plaster took 45 minutes to replace, so combined with repeated takes, a scene that was an eighth of a page in the script took two days to film. Another repeated take was one five-second shot being filmed over a hundred times: Meg being attacked by Raoul and dropping Sarah&#x27;s medical kit. The shot was repeated so it would look like Meg did not toss the kit but instead lost it. Simultaneously, the kit needed to land in frame and in focus for the audience. Fincher argued for repeated takes so he could combine performances by the actors for &quot;fluid&quot; scenes. He also repeated takes with Stewart to ensure that her acting would be comparable to Foster&#x27;s veteran performance.

The studio planned to release &quot;Panic Room&quot; in February 2002, but it determined that production could not be completed by then. Executives reviewed dailies of the film&#x27;s opening scene and did not like Foster &quot;hiding her stomach under a coat and purse&quot;. (Foster was also suffering from a sprained hip from distended ligaments due to her pregnancy.) The studio suspended production until after Foster&#x27;s childbirth and rescheduled for the film to be released in March 2002. Foster gave birth in September 2001, and she returned to perform re-shoots, including the opening scene. She also returned two months later for additional filming, which concluded that November. Columbia Pictures screened the film for test audiences, who rated poorly the ending with the SWAT raid and Burnham&#x27;s capture. By the screening, the set had been deconstructed due to storage costs, and Fincher estimated that it would cost to rebuild enough of the set to reshoot the ending. Instead, editors Haygood and Wall revisited Burnham&#x27;s scenes and chose takes in which the character would appear less sympathetic. The final production budget for &quot;Panic Room&quot; was .

===Visual and practical effects===

A seamless shot at the beginning of &quot;Panic Room&quot; took nine days to film on set but took several months to complete in post-production. The shot was a combination of camera footage and computer-generated effects. Koepp originally wrote the opening scene to be a series of shots that would zero in on the brownstone house, but Fincher instead chose a sequence of landmarks in New York City with credits hovering in front of them before the sequence transited seamlessly to introduce the film&#x27;s main characters. The opening titles were inspired by those seen in &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; (1955) and &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959). The scene of Burnham&#x27;s arrest also used computer-generated effects. Several scenes also involved practical effects: Junior&#x27;s injuries from a flaming gas burn and Stephen Altman&#x27;s bloodied, beaten self. A team of puppeteers was used to move Stephen&#x27;s sticking-out collarbone. Fincher also sent the film reel to be digitally color-corrected as he had done for &quot;Fight Club&quot; and &quot;Seven&quot;.

==Critical perspectives and themes==
===Social commentary and cultural relevance===
Bianca Nielsen&#x27;s analysis of &quot;Panic Room&quot; situates the film within the broader cultural and political anxieties surrounding personal and national security, particularly in the post-9/11 context. According to Nielsen, the film critiques the burgeoning &quot;culture of fear&quot; fostered by media and the security industry, which commodify panic as a means of social control. The titular panic room, ostensibly a haven against the dangers of home invasion, instead becomes a site of vulnerability, reflecting misplaced faith in security technologies. This contradiction underscores the limitations of consumerist solutions to threats, even as the film ultimately relies on the intervention of institutional forces, such as the police, to resolve its narrative.

Nielsen draws parallels between the film&#x27;s depiction of a dystopian urban space and director David Fincher&#x27;s broader oeuvre, including &quot;Fight Club&quot; and &quot;Se7en&quot;. These works collectively explore themes of social and institutional decay. &quot;Panic Room&quot; critiques the commodification of fear and examines the intersections of gender, power, and security, especially through the character of Meg Altman (Jodie Foster). Foster&#x27;s performance is seen as pivotal, blending her established on-screen persona of resilience and defiance with the film&#x27;s commentary on societal reliance on patriarchal institutions. While the film questions the efficacy of both personal and systemic defenses, it reaffirms institutional authority, thereby reflecting the ambivalent politics of the era.

===Feminism and the conspiracy thriller genre===

In their analysis of &quot;Panic Room&quot;, Jyotsna Kapur contextualizes the film within a broader trend of conspiracy thrillers that explore themes of domestic vulnerability and parental anxiety. Kapur identifies the film&#x27;s narrative as emblematic of a shift in contemporary American cinema, where the domestic sphere, traditionally viewed as a space of safety, becomes a site of intrusion and threat. They argue that Jodie Foster&#x27;s character embodies a gendered portrayal of paranoia, marked by vulnerability and the blurring of rationality, reflecting societal anxieties about motherhood and the fragility of home life. The panic room itself, a technological safeguard against invasion, becomes a paradoxical symbol of both protection and entrapment, highlighting the protagonist&#x27;s isolation and the broader insecurities of the neoliberal era.

Kapur further contrasts &quot;Panic Room&quot; with earlier cinematic portrayals of women&#x27;s paranoia, noting how the film adapts tropes from Gothic literature and 1940s &quot;women&#x27;s films&quot; to reflect contemporary fears. While the protagonist demonstrates resourcefulness and agency in confronting external threats, her portrayal simultaneously underscores traditional gendered associations with emotional instability and domestic responsibility. According to Kapur, the film&#x27;s emphasis on surveillance, technological dependency, and invasive danger encapsulates a pervasive cultural unease tied to the privatization of risk and the erosion of collective social safety nets.

===Tomboy identity and feminist resistance===
In &quot;Panic Room&quot;, the mother-daughter relationship between Meg and Sarah Altman is a focal point for exploring feminist and gender-related themes, as Lynne Stahl observes in &quot;The Velvet Light Trap&quot;. The film subverts the typical cinematic trope of &quot;tomboy taming&quot;, where tomboyish traits are abandoned in adolescence in favor of conventional femininity. Instead, Meg, portrayed by Jodie Foster, and her daughter Sarah, played by Kristen Stewart, exhibit a resistant gender nonconformity that persists throughout the narrative. Stahl argues that this dynamic, paired with Foster&#x27;s legacy of portraying gender-defiant roles, redefines motherhood as a site of feminist resistance, challenging traditional maternal norms through a &quot;queer feminist reproductivity&quot;. This relationship mirrors and strengthens Foster’s star image, which has often aligned with themes of female autonomy and critique of heteronormativity.

Stahl further situates the home invasion scenario as a metaphor for patriarchal intrusion, with the panic room representing a space of autonomy reclaimed through tomboyish resilience. The narrative constructs Meg&#x27;s transformation from a seemingly fragile mother into a decisive protector as one driven by her reconnection to a tomboyish past, inspired by Sarah&#x27;s embodiment of defiant femininity. Through its metatextual engagement with Foster&#x27;s career and its narrative elements, &quot;Panic Room&quot; challenges dominant cinematic conventions. The film resists the commodification of female vulnerability, opting instead to portray survival as an act of agency, reframing the interplay of gender and power in the thriller genre.

===Surveillance and its duality===

Dietmar Kammerer, in their analysis within &quot;Surveillance &amp; Society&quot;, explores the portrayal of surveillance in &quot;Panic Room&quot; as emblematic of the broader cultural ambivalence toward surveillance technologies. Unlike other contemporary films that integrate surveillance aesthetics into their narrative framework, &quot;Panic Room&quot; depicts surveillance both as a tool of protection and a mechanism of entrapment. The film&#x27;s titular room, equipped with a sophisticated CCTV system, initially symbolizes safety for the protagonist, Meg Altman, and her daughter. However, this secure space paradoxically becomes a prison, mirroring the contradiction inherent in surveillance as both enabling and constraining.

Kammerer highlights the film&#x27;s unique cinematography, which eschews direct integration of CCTV imagery in favor of a &quot;divine&quot; omniscient camera. This approach allows the narrative to critique the panoptic nature of surveillance systems while maintaining the suspense of a closed environment. Ultimately, Meg&#x27;s destruction of the surveillance cameras with a sledgehammer underscores the ambivalence of such technologies, aligning with David Lyon&#x27;s framework of surveillance as having &quot;two faces&quot;—simultaneously protective and oppressive.

===Diabetes as narrative and metaphor===
In &quot;Panic Room&quot;, diabetes serves as a pivotal narrative device, reflecting broader themes of control and vulnerability. Kevin L. Ferguson, in their analysis published in the &quot;Journal of Medical Humanities&quot;, observes that the depiction of preteen Sarah Altman&#x27;s (Kristen Stewart) diabetes is central to the film’s dramatic tension. Her condition is revealed through subtle visual cues, such as her bedside refrigerator stocked with insulin and orange juice, as well as her sleek digital glucometer watch, which continuously displays her blood sugar levels. This watch becomes a visual countdown, heightening the stakes as her blood sugar dangerously drops during the siege of the panic room.

Ferguson notes that &quot;Panic Room&quot; employs Sarah&#x27;s diabetes to explore the broader cinematic trope of &quot;discipline and surveillance&quot;. The film&#x27;s intricate exploration of technological surveillance, epitomized by the panic room&#x27;s closed-circuit monitors, parallels Sarah&#x27;s self-monitoring through her glucometer. This intertwining of technological transparency with Sarah&#x27;s health condition not only underscores her vulnerability but also implicates viewers in the act of surveillance. Ferguson argues that this alignment positions diabetic self-care as a site of both personal discipline and external oversight, reflecting societal anxieties about control and dependence on technology.

&quot;Panic Room&quot; thus uses Sarah&#x27;s diabetes not merely as a plot mechanism but as a metaphorical lens, examining the intersections of health, technology, and human fragility. Through its meticulous depiction of diabetic care and its integration into the narrative&#x27;s central conflict, the film contributes to what Ferguson terms the &quot;cinema of control&quot;, where illness becomes a tool for exploring themes of dependency and resilience.

===Race, real estate, and systemic critique===
Carol Siegel&#x27;s analysis in &quot;Quarterly Review of Film and Video&quot; examines &quot;Panic Room&quot; through the dual lenses of race and real estate, exploring how the film metaphorically critiques systemic inequalities in American society. Siegel argues that the film uses the titular panic room and the broader architectural mise-en-scène to symbolize the intersections of race and property ownership. The panic room, designed by Burnham, an African American character, becomes both a literal and metaphorical fortress for its white inhabitants, highlighting the racialized boundaries that define access to safety and privilege. Meanwhile, the invaders represent those excluded from these privileges, with their race and economic struggles juxtaposed against the wealth and isolation of the film&#x27;s protagonists.

The narrative explores how property and architecture reflect social hierarchies, positioning homeownership as a site of identity, security, and status. Siegel identifies the film&#x27;s central tension as a critique of homeownership&#x27;s mythos, presenting the house not as a sanctuary but as a site of entrapment and conflict. The analysis also underscores the racial implications of property ownership, as characters of color are either excluded from or sacrificed to maintain the sanctity of white domestic spaces. By intertwining race and real estate, &quot;Panic Room&quot; offers a symbolic critique of the economic and racial values underpinning American identity, emphasizing the exclusionary and hierarchical nature of the American dream.

===Ecocriticism and Anthropocene anxiety===

River Ramuglia, in &quot;Resilience: A Journal of the Environmental Humanities&quot;, explores the film through an ecocritical lens, interpreting it as a commentary on environmental consciousness intertwined with national security anxieties post-9/11. While &quot;Panic Room&quot; superficially aligns with domestic narratives of post-9/11 sociopolitical concerns, Ramuglia situates the film within broader ecological themes, particularly Robert Marzec&#x27;s concept of &quot;natural security&quot;. This framework expands traditional national security to encompass fears tied to climate change and resource scarcity. The panic room, with its fortified and surveillant design, serves as a microcosm of ecological and national insecurities, mirroring both the protagonists&#x27; urban privilege and their dependency on fragile environmental systems. By invoking Timothy Clark&#x27;s notion of &quot;Anthropocene disorder&quot;, Ramuglia suggests the film exposes the dissonance between human-scale domesticity and global ecological crises.

The film&#x27;s use of cinematic techniques and visual metaphors reinforces this dual commentary. Scenes depicting the panic room&#x27;s surveillance system juxtaposed with the broader mansion highlight human reliance on mediated perceptions of space, akin to the Anthropocene&#x27;s cognitive challenges of comprehending planetary scales. Furthermore, the protagonists&#x27; journey—from the isolated, hermetically sealed panic room to the public spaces of New York City—mirrors the oscillation between private and public ecologies. According to Ramuglia, this trajectory critiques Western domestic security&#x27;s complicity in exacerbating ecological instability. The film&#x27;s allegorical layering extends beyond the domestic sphere to address systemic inequalities, urban ecological dependencies, and the persistent illusions of self-sufficiency in a destabilized world.

===Domestic space, security, and fragility===

Peter King, in their article in &quot;Housing, Theory and Society&quot;, examines &quot;Panic Room&quot; as a lens to critique Gaston Bachelard&#x27;s idealized concept of home as a space of privacy, security, and intimacy. King argues that David Fincher&#x27;s film disrupts this benign vision by presenting the home as a site of anxiety and potential violation. The titular panic room, a fortified sanctuary within the house, is both a symbol of ultimate security and an emblem of isolation and helplessness, highlighting the paradoxes inherent in the pursuit of absolute safety. King situates the film within broader discussions of domesticity, contending that its portrayal of invasion and defense underscores the fragility of the dwelling&#x27;s role in fostering ontological security.

King further situates &quot;Panic Room&quot; within the context of housing research, emphasizing how Fincher&#x27;s treatment of space and technology critiques the limitations of Bachelard&#x27;s optimistic framework. King&#x27;s analysis juxtaposes the panic room&#x27;s physical impenetrability with the psychological and emotional vulnerabilities it exposes. By framing the narrative as a battle for control over domestic space, the film reflects broader tensions in housing phenomena, where security measures can paradoxically generate new anxieties. King&#x27;s work underscores the potential of film as a medium for interrogating the complexities of housing and its sociocultural implications.

===Mortality, security, and existential dread===
In &quot;Panic Room&quot;, the portrayal of the titular safe room draws thematic parallels to Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s exploration of premature burial, as analyzed by John Kitterman. The film echoes the gothic tradition of Poe&#x27;s tales, such as &quot;The Premature Burial&quot; and &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, by framing its narrative around the paradoxical entrapment of safety and fear. Kitterman observes that the film&#x27;s protagonist, Meg Altman, symbolizes an unconscious desire to confront mortality, a notion mirrored in Poe&#x27;s characters who unwittingly court their fears by seeking refuge. This dynamic underscores a broader cultural reflection on the illusion of security and the human impulse to face existential dread, even as they attempt to evade it.

Kitterman also connects the narrative to post-9/11 anxieties, drawing on the increased prominence of surveillance and the &quot;bunker mentality&quot; pervasive in early 21st-century America. The panic room itself becomes a metaphor for both physical and psychological entombment, revealing vulnerabilities rather than mitigating them. The film critiques the effectiveness of technological safeguards in a world fraught with uncertainties, much as Poe&#x27;s stories question the limits of human control over mortality. Kitterman argues that &quot;Panic Room&quot; fails to provide true catharsis for these fears, offering instead a veneer of resolution that conceals deeper existential ambiguities.

==Theatrical run==
Columbia Pictures marketed &quot;Panic Room&quot; as being produced by the same director who produced &quot;Seven&quot; and &quot;Fight Club&quot;. Fincher disagreed with the approach because he believed that &quot;Panic Room&quot; did not match the tone of his previous two films and that it would not appeal to the same audiences. He believed &quot;Panic Room&quot; would appeal more to audiences who saw &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Bone Collector&quot; (1999). He also disagreed with the studio&#x27;s marketing materials for &quot;Panic Room&quot;, which advertised it as &quot;the most terrifying movie ever made&quot;. Fincher also argued with the studio about the poster design, which he believed reflected the film&#x27;s themes, and the studio relented in publishing Fincher&#x27;s poster.

&quot;Panic Room&quot; had its world premiere on , 2002 in Los Angeles. Fincher refused to edit the film to receive a PG-13 rating (parental guidance for children under 13) from the Motion Picture Association of America, so the MPAA gave the film an R rating (restricted to filmgoers at least 17 years old) for violence and language. It was commercially released in the United States and Canada on March 29, 2002. It was screened in and grossed on its opening weekend. It ranked first at the box office, and for both actor Jodie Foster and director David Fincher, the opening weekend gross was a personal best to date. It surpassed &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999) to have the biggest Easter holiday-weekend opening and also had the third biggest opening to date for a non-supernatural thriller film, following &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2001) and &quot;Ransom&quot; (1996). Audiences polled by CinemaScore, during the opening-weekend, gave &quot;Panic Room&quot; a &quot;B&quot; grade on an A+ to F scale. The audience demographic was 53% female and 47% male, and 62% of audience members were aged 25 years and older.

In the film&#x27;s second weekend (April 5–7) in the United States and Canada, it ranked first again with , competing mainly with the new release &quot;High Crimes&quot;. The film went on to gross at the US and Canadian box office and in other territories&#x27; box offices for a worldwide total of . (In 2006, the film had a re-release in Hong Kong that grossed , increasing the total to .) The film was Fincher&#x27;s second highest-grossing to date after &quot;Seven&quot;, which grossed worldwide. In the United States and Canada, &quot;Panic Room&quot; ranks fifth among David Fincher&#x27;s films in box office gross. Adjusted for inflation, &quot;Panic Room&quot; ranks third. Worldwide, unadjusted for inflation, it ranks fifth.

==Critical reception==
Critics called &quot;Panic Room&quot; &quot;a high-tension narrative&quot;. They compared the film to the works of Alfred Hitchcock, both positively and negatively. Several critics thought the film was too mainstream after Fincher&#x27;s &quot;Fight Club&quot;. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 76% of 188 sampled critics gave the film positive reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The consensus states: &quot;Elevated by David Fincher&#x27;s directorial talent and Jodie Foster&#x27;s performance, &quot;Panic Room&quot; is a well-crafted, above-average thriller.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, gave the film a score of 65 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Seven&quot; was stylishly gloomy, and &quot;Fight Club&quot; was smarmily pretentious, while &quot;Panic Room&quot; has been admirably stripped down to atmosphere as a function of architecture, and action as a consequence of character.&quot; Morgenstern commended the characters Meg and Sarah as feminist heroines and also called the home invaders &quot;intriguing&quot;. He also applauded Foster&#x27;s performance and the film&#x27;s cinematography, and he said to Koepp&#x27;s script as &quot;all worked out too&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, describing &quot;Panic Room&quot; as close to &quot;the ideal of a thriller existing entirely in a world of physical and psychological plausibility.&quot; Ebert wrote, &quot;There are moments when I want to shout advice at the screen, but just as often the characters are ahead of me.&quot; Ebert also called Fincher &quot;a visual virtuoso&quot;, and applauded Foster&#x27;s performance as &quot;spellbinding&quot;.

==Home media==
&quot;Panic Room&quot; was first released on VHS and DVD on September 17, 2002. The studio produced VHS copies for rental only, believing that owners of DVD players were more likely to buy the film. The studio used the design from the theatrical release poster for the video cover, where Fincher had wanted a black cover that would differ from the poster. Though previsualization supervisor Ron Frankel wanted to include materials to show storyboard animation, the DVD was released as a single-disc edition with no audio commentary or other features. Fincher also chose not to include on the DVD scenes filmed with Nicole Kidman before she was replaced by Jodie Foster. In its first week, the film ranked second in DVD sales after &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, though it ranked first in DVD rentals. In March 2004, the studio released a special edition DVD, which consisted of three discs, two which provided featurettes of the pre-production, production, and post-production processes for the film. The DVD also had several commentary tracks, including one by the director. Author John T. Caldwell cites the special edition DVD of &quot;Panic Room&quot; as an example of demonstrating directorial control to &quot;aesthetically elevate&quot; the film.

Columbia Pictures sold the television rights for &quot;Panic Room&quot; to Turner Broadcasting and CBS, who shared the rights over five years. In September 2004, Turner aired the film on channels TBS and TNT for 12 months, and afterward, CBS aired the film three times in an 18-month span. Turner resumed airing &quot;Panic Room&quot; for 30 months after CBS&#x27;s turn.

In 2014, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; listed &quot;Panic Room&quot; as one of 15 films which (at the time) notably lacked a Blu-ray release. A decade later, Fincher would go on to supervise a 4K remaster of the film, which Sony would ultimately release on Ultra HD Blu-ray on , 2025, in a special Steelbook edition also containing a standard Blu-ray disc and including the special features originally produced for DVD, marking its official debut on both formats.

==Accolades==
Howard Shore won from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers an ASCAP Award in the Top Box Office Film music category for his scores for &quot;Panic Room&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;. The Art Directors Guild nominated &quot;Panic Room&quot; for the Excellence in Production Design for a Contemporary Film Award. The Online Film Critics Society Award nominated &quot;Panic Room&quot; for Best Editing. &quot;Panic Room&quot; won an award at the 3rd Golden Trailer Awards for having the Best Horror/Thriller film trailer, beating fellow nominees &quot;Signs&quot;, &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;, and &quot;No Such Thing&quot;. For her performance in the film, Jodie Foster was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actress.
==Remake==
In December 2024, Sony Pictures began development of a Brazilian remake with Ísis Valverde attached to the lead role.

<doc id="450142" wikidata="Q504672" url="?curid=450142" title="List of presidents of Tunisia">
<text>The president of Tunisia is the head of state of Tunisia, directly elected to a five-year term by the people. The officeholder leads the executive branch of the Tunisian government along with the prime minister and is the commander-in-chief of the Tunisian Armed Forces.

Since the office was established in 1957, Five men have served as president. The seventh and current president is Kais Saied since 23 October 2019. There are currently three living former presidents. The most recent former president to die was Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, on 19 September 2019.

The presidency of Mohamed Ennaceur, who assumed the office as acting president following the death of incumbent president Beji Caid Essebsi, was the shortest in Tunisian history (90 days). Habib Bourguiba, the inaugural holder, served the longest, over thirty years (1957–1987), before he was removed from office by his prime minister Ben Ali, on 7 November 1987. Since the ratification of the Tunisian Constitution in 2014, no person may be elected president more than twice.

Of those who have served as the nation&#x27;s president, only one died in office of natural causes (Beji Caid Essebsi), two were removed from office (Habib Bourguiba and Zine El Abidine Ben Ali) and two assumed the office as acting presidents (Fouad Mebazaa and Mohamed Ennaceur).

==Background==
Tunisia has had seven presidents since the proclamation of the republic on 25 July 1957:
* Habib Bourguiba was appointed president by the parliament on 25 July 1957, until the election of a permanent president. After the Constitution was enacted on 1 June 1959, a presidential election was held on 8 November 1959. Being the only one running for office, he gained 91% of the votes to serve a five-year term. He was elected unopposed three more times. Shortly after winning his fourth full term, he was proclaimed president for life. He remained in office until being deposed in the coup d&#x27;état of 7 November 1987, organized by his prime minister, Ben Ali.
* Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was prime minister and interior minister under Bourguiba. Ben Ali had Bourguiba declared medically unfit to serve 7 November 1987. Per the constitution, he became acting president pending new elections. Ben Ali was elected unopposed for a full five-year term on 2 April 1989, and was reelected three more times (the first time unopposed). On 14 January 2011, his regime fell in the Tunisian Revolution that started on 17 December 2010. Mohamed Ghannouchi, his prime minister, claimed the presidency, serving as acting president.
* Fouad Mebazaa was designated by the Constitutional Council to serve as acting president on 15 January 2011. Under Article 57 of the constitution, an election should have taken place between 45 and 60 days following Mebazaa&#x27;s appointment. But on 3 March 2011, he announced the repeal of the 1959 constitution and the election of a constituent assembly which had to draft a new one. Therefore, he remained acting president pending new elections.
* Moncef Marzouki was elected president by the Tunisian Constituent Assembly on 12 December 2011. The next day, he was inaugurated, making him the first president not to be member of the ruling party. During the 2014 presidential election, he was defeated by former prime minister Caid Essebsi and left office on 31 December 2014.
* Beji Caid Essebsi became the first president to be elected by universal suffrage after the revolution, on 21 December 2014. On 31 December 2014, he took office as the fifth president of Tunisia, and the first to be freely elected. He died on 25 July 2019, and was succeeded by Mohamed Ennaceur as acting president.
* Mohamed Ennaceur became acting president in accordance with Articles 84 and 85 of the constitution on 25 July 2019, following the death in office of President Essebsi. Per the constitution, Ennaceur was to serve as acting president for no more than 90 days, during which an early presidential election was to be held. An election had already been scheduled for November 2019, but was brought forward to September to ensure that a new president would be sworn in before the 90-day limit.
* Kais Saied was elected in September 2019. He took office on 23 October as the second president (Marzouki being the first) who was not an heir to Bourguiba&#x27;s legacy.

<text>The president of the Republic of Uganda is the head of state and the head of government of Uganda. The president leads the executive branch of the government of Uganda and is the commander-in-chief of the Uganda People&#x27;s Defence Force.

== Background ==

The office of the president of Uganda was formed on 9th October 1963 to replace the queen of Uganda (which was last held by Elizabeth II) as head of state. It was entirely a ceremonial role i.e without executive powers during the time of the first holder Mutesa II of Bugandauntil the end of the Mengo Crisis in 1967 when Milton Obote took over ending the alliance between the Uganda People’s Congress and the Kabaka Yekka parties combining the roles of prime minister and president and therefore creating the first president of Uganda with executive powers. 
The office has been held by 9 people, 8 of whom (besides Edward Muteesa) came into power through military coups and civil war. 

The incumbent Yoweri Museveni came to power in 1986 and is the longest serving president of Uganda, ahead of Idi Amin who ruled from 1971 to 1979.

==Qualifications==

In 2005 presidential term limits were removed, and in 2017, the previous upper age limit of 75 was also removed.

Under Article 102 of the Constitution, in order to be allowed to run for the presidency one must be a citizen of Uganda by birth, be no younger than thirty-five and eligible to be a member of Parliament.

== State House ==
State House is the official residence of the president of Uganda. The main State House was constructed in 1925 during the governorship of Sir Geoffrey Archer at Entebbe the then capital to serve as the official residence of the Governor of Uganda. After the country gained independence in 1962, the residence continued to be the official residence of the president of the Republic of Uganda. However, it was first inhabited by Sir William Frederick Gowers, while the second State House is at Nakasero.

<doc id="450148" wikidata="Q4351534" url="?curid=450148" title="HMS Argyll (1904)">
<text>HMS &quot;Argyll&quot; was one of six armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She was assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet upon completion and was transferred to the 5th Cruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet in 1909. Two years later, she was detached to escort the royal yacht during King George V&#x27;s trip to British India. &quot;Argyll&quot; was assigned to the 3rd Cruiser Squadron of the reserve Second Fleet in 1913.

Upon mobilisation in mid-1914, her squadron was assigned to the Grand Fleet; &quot;Argyll&quot; did not see combat before she ran aground and was wrecked in October 1915. Her crew were rescued without loss and the wreck was later salvaged before it was demolished. Nonetheless, it remains diveable.

==Design and description==

&quot;Argyll&quot; was designed to displace . The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She was powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The engines were powered by sixteen Babcock &amp; Wilcox and six cylindrical boilers. &quot;Argyll&quot; was the only ship of the class not to exceed during her sea trials. She carried a maximum of of coal and her complement consisted of 610 officers and ratings.

Her main armament consisted of four breech-loading (BL) 7.5-inch Mk I guns mounted in four single-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure and one on each side. The guns fired their shells to a range of about . Her secondary armament of six BL 6-inch Mk VII guns was arranged in casemates amidships. Four of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather. They had a maximum range of approximately with their shells. &quot;Argyll&quot; also carried 18 quick-firing (QF) 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes. Her two 12-pounder 8 cwt guns could be dismounted for service ashore.

At some point in the war, the main deck six-inch guns of the &quot;Devonshire&quot;-class ships were moved to the upper deck and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve seakeeping and the four 3-pounder guns displaced by the transfer were landed.

The ship&#x27;s waterline armour belt had a maximum thickness of and was closed off by transverse bulkheads. The armour of the gun turrets was also five inches thick whilst that of their barbettes was six inches thick. The protective deck armour ranged in thickness from and the conning tower was protected by of armour.

==Construction and service==

&quot;Argyll&quot;, named to commemorate the Scottish county, was laid down at Scotts Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering at their Greenock shipyard on 25 March 1902 and was launched on 3 March 1904. She was completed in December 1905 and was assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet in January 1906. On 25 April 1907, &quot;Argyll&quot;, along with the cruisers , and , arrived at Hampton Roads from Bermuda for the opening of the Jamestown Tercentennial Exposition. She was transferred to the 5th Cruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet in 1909. Two years later, she was detached from the squadron to escort the Royal Yacht during the King&#x27;s trip to the Delhi Durbar in India in 1911–12. She ran aground in Plymouth Sound on 28 December 1912. The following year, she was assigned to the 3rd Cruiser Squadron of the Second Fleet.

The squadron was assigned to the Grand Fleet in mid-1914 as the Navy mobilised for war. It spent much of its time with the Grand Fleet reinforcing the patrols near the Shetland and Faeroe Islands and the Norwegian coast where &quot;Argyll&quot; captured a German merchantman on 6 August. She ran aground on the Bell Rock near Dundee on 28 October 1915 at coordinates at night during a storm. During the war, lighthouses were ordered to switch their lights off for fear of assisting German U-boats in their operations, and the light was only turned on by special permission. En route &quot;Argyll&quot; sent a signal requesting the light to be turned on, but the lighthouse did not have a radio and could only be contacted by boat or visual signals. Attempts to notify the lighthouse failed, but the ship was not notified of the failure and proceeded in the expectation of using the light. Soon afterwards, she ran aground at 04:30, suffering extensive damage to much of the hull and starting a fire. Two destroyers, and , were sent and rescued her entire crew without serious injury.

The Navy salvaged all of the valuable items on board, including her guns, and she was demolished by the salvage team. In 1970, her two propellers were recovered by divers and sold for scrap. She remains a diveable wreck.

<doc id="450149" wikidata="Q471517" url="?curid=450149" title="Joseph Ralston">
<text>General Joseph Wood Ralston (born November 4, 1943) is a retired general and diplomat who holds senior positions in various defense related corporations. He was previously a career officer in the United States Air Force, and served as the fourth vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (1996–2000), Supreme Allied Commander for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Europe (2000–2003), and the United States Special Envoy for countering the Kurdistan Workers Party (2006–2007).

==Career==
===Military career===
Ralston served in the United States Air Force (USAF) from 1965 to 2003. He served in operational command at squadron, wing, numbered air force and major command, as well as various staff and management positions at every level of the USAF.

Ralston became Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1996. He was favored to become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1997. Following revelations of an extra-marital affair with a civilian employee of the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1980s, he remained vice chairman until May 2000 when he was appointed Supreme Allied Commander Europe for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Europe. He retired in March 2003 and joined the Board of Trustees of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Former U.S. president Bill Clinton writes in his memoirs &quot;My Life&quot; that Ralston was used to resolve a potentially sticky situation with Pakistan in which the U.S. would use Pakistani airspace to strike at the Al-Qaeda organization meeting in Afghanistan following the U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. There was U.S. concern that Pakistan&#x27;s intelligence services would tip off the targets or even worse assume the missiles over Pakistan came from India, potentially triggering a nuclear conflict on the Indian subcontinent. As Clinton writes on page 799 of &quot;My Life&quot;, &quot;we decided to send the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joe Ralston, to have dinner with the top Pakistani military commander at the time the attacks were scheduled. Ralston would tell him (the Pakistani general) what was happening a few minutes before our missiles invaded Pakistani airspace, too late to alert the Taliban or Al-Qaeda, but in time to avoid having them shot down or sparking a counterattack on India.&quot;

In September 2006, Ralston was assigned as Special Envoy for Countering the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) by U.S. president George W. Bush. The PKK is a Kurdish armed militant group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Turkey and the European Union.

Ralston was one of at least three retired four-star generals asked by the Bush administration to oversee both wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Ralston and the two other generals, however, all declined this position.

===Corporate career===
Ralston is director of the Timken Company and the URS Corporation, is on the Board of Directors of Lockheed Martin and has been Vice Chairman of the Cohen Group, since March 2003. He also sits on the advisory board of the American Turkish Council, an American-Turkish lobby group.

==Controversies==
===Accusation of moral double-standard===
In 1997, Ralston was the top candidate to succeed John M. Shalikashvili as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1997 when it became public that Ralston had an extramarital affair with a married civilian CIA employee during the 1980s. Ralston said he and his wife were separated at the time while his wife said that the affair continued afterwards and led to their divorce. Defense Secretary William Cohen declared that Ralston&#x27;s relationship 13 years ago would not &quot;automatically disqualify&quot; him from becoming the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, resulting in accusations of a double standard for high-ranking military officers while lower ranks were punished. A month earlier, the first female B-52 pilot, First Lieutenant Kelly Flinn, had been forced to resign from the Air Force with a general discharge after having been charged with adultery. Ralston eventually withdrew his name from consideration.

===Alleged conflicts of interest===
Ralston held various senior positions in defense and security-related corporations, simultaneously with his diplomatic role as &quot;anti PKK coordinator&quot;. Critics said Ralston was using his influence as special envoy to secure large government weapons contracts for arms maker Lockheed Martin where he was on the board of directors. Besides, he was also on the advisory board of the American Turkish Council (ATC). The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; described him as &quot;an arms merchant in diplomat&#x27;s clothing.&quot;

In October 2006, the Kurdish National Congress of North America issued a press release demanding &quot;the immediate resignation&quot; of General Joseph Ralston:

Since the PKK insurgency began in 1983, 30,000 people have died and over 3,000 Kurdish villages have been destroyed, often by U.S. supplied planes. Critics are concerned that hard line anti-PKK policies influenced by conflicting interests would compromise the prospects for longterm solution to the Kurdish–Turkish issue.

On October 1, 2006, the PKK announced a unilateral cease-fire in south-east Turkey, a move that the Turkish government has rejected:

Speaking before the Eurasian Strategic Research Center (ASAM) in Istanbul, Ralston mirrored the Turkish government&#x27;s rhetoric :

<doc id="450150" wikidata="Q18985034" url="?curid=450150" title="President of Zambia">
<text>The president of the Republic of Zambia is the head of state and head of government of Zambia and is the highest executive authority in the country. The president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term and is responsible for the administration of the government, overseeing the implementation of national policies, and representing Zambia in international affairs. The office was established at Zambia&#x27;s independence in 1964. The current president is Hakainde Hichilema, who assumed office on August 24, 2021, following the 2021 presidential election where his party, the United Party for National Development, won a majority. The president&#x27;s role includes appointing the Cabinet, serving as Commander-in-Chief of the Zambian Defence Force, and ensuring the enforcement of laws.

The office was first held by Kenneth Kaunda following independence in 1964. Since 1991, when Kaunda left the presidency, the office has been held by six others: Frederick Chiluba, Levy Mwanawasa, Rupiah Banda, Michael Sata, Edgar Lungu and the current president Hakainde Hichilema. In addition, acting president Guy Scott served in an interim capacity after the death of President Michael Sata.

Since 31 August 1991 the president is also the head of government, as the position of Prime Minister was abolished in the last months of Kaunda&#x27;s presidential term following negotiations with opposition parties.

==Presidential term==
The president is elected for a term of five years. Since 1991, There is a two-term limit for the president in the Constitution of Zambia. There was an attempt to modify the term limits in 2001 for Chiluba, but it did not materialize. 

==History==

===Northern Rhodesia===
When the British colony of Northern Rhodesia was separated from Southern Rhodesia and British South Africa Company rule, the head of state was the British Monarch represented in the colony by the Governor of Northern Rhodesia who exercised executive power as head of state and government. In the 1964 Northern Rhodesian general election, the office of Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia was created to become the head of government ahead of independence. On 19 May 1964, the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations Duncan Sandys announced that Northern Rhodesia would become independent under a president. The election for the first president would be held by secret ballot amongst the elected members of the Legislative Council.

===Zambia===
Upon independence and the renaming of the country as Zambia, Prime Minister Kenneth Kaunda was elected as the first president. The office of Prime Minister was also abolished making the presidency an executive post. Initially, the country would be governed as a multi-party democracy. However, following the African National Congress integrating with United National Independence Party (UNIP), President Kaunda announced that the Constitution of Zambia would be changed to turn the country into a one-party state in 1973 with UNIP as the only legal party with all others banned. Kaunda claimed this was done to discourage tribalism. However, the constitution also restored the office of Prime Minister as head of government. In the 1973 Zambian general election, voters were only able to vote for the UNIP sponsored Kaunda and their only options were to vote if they approved or rejected his candidacy.

Kaunda was re-elected unanimously at each election until 1991. During the 1980s, pressures increased for the multi-party ban to be rescinded. After negotiations with the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) in 1990, President Kaunda signed a constitutional amendment legalising political parties other than UNIP. The office of Prime Minister was abolished again and the powers returned to the president. In the 1991 Zambian general election, Kaunda was defeated by the MMD&#x27;s Frederick Chiluba. Kaunda agreed to hand over the presidency peacefully, becoming the second African leader to do so after Mathieu Kérékou of Benin.

In 1996, President Chiluba allegedly discovered a plot by members of UNIP to carry out a coup d&#x27;état and declared a state of emergency to arrest UNIP members. However the Supreme Court of Zambia declared the emergency declaration was not valid and lifted the state of emergency and released those arrested. Later in the year, Chiluba amended the constitution stating that only people who had one parent born in Zambia or Northern Rhodesia could run for president. This amendment was ostensibly targeted at blocking Kaunda from standing for president again as his parents had been born in Nyasaland (modern day Malawi).

Due to a two-term limit in the constitution, Levy Mwanawasa was selected by Chiluba as the MMD&#x27;s candidate to succeed him. Mwanawasa won the 2001 Zambian general election but his victory was marred by accusations of electoral fraud by opposition parties. Following legal disputes, the Supreme Court eventually ruled in 2005 that though the poll was &quot;flawed&quot;, there were not enough errors to justify overturning the result. Mwanawasa won re-election in 2006. He died in 2008 and was replaced by Rupiah Banda. In the 2011 Zambian general election Rupiah was defeated by the Patriotic Front&#x27;s (PF) Michael Sata.

Sata died in office in 2014. Accordingly, his Vice-President Guy Scott became president in an acting capacity. This made Scott the first white head of state of an African country since South Africa&#x27;s F. W. de Klerk who left office in 1994 following the end of apartheid. However, because his parents were not born in Zambia, due to the constitution he was only able to act as president for 90 days and could not stand for election. At the 2015 Zambian presidential election, the PF&#x27;s Edgar Lungu won the presidency and retained it a year later in the 2016 general election under the amended constitution.

There are four most notable changes affecting the presidency in this amendment assented to by Edgar Lungu in January 2016, most of which are found in Part VII(7) of the constitution . Firstly, Article 100 Section 1 a) effectively removal the parental clause requiring presidential and vice presidential candidates to have at least one parent born in Zambia and the harmonisation of Presidential and Vice-presidential eligibility in Article 110 Section 2. Secondly, Article 101 Sections 1, 2 3 (a &amp; b) and 8 signalled the shift from a First-Past the Post system to a Two-round system in which over 50% of valid votes cast are required for a president to win. In the event that this does not happen a second round will be held within 37 days between the two leading candidates to which the 50% + 1 rule will determine the winner on that second round. The third notable change is in the introduction of the running mate clause in Article 110 Sections 1, 2 and 3. This saw the President and Vice President directly elected on the same ticket as opposed to before where the President who once elected appoints and dismisses the vice president executively. Lastly, the fourth change was in Article 100 Section 1 j) which requires an aspiring presidential candidates to prove to have at least 100 registered voters in each of the ten provinces to successfully file for nominations with the Electoral Commission of Zambia. In 2020, Lungu attempted to change the constitution to allow the President to change electoral laws and take control of Zambia&#x27;s monetary policy. However the controversial Bill 10 failed after the Parliament of Zambia did not vote in favour with the required 2/3 majority.

<text>Muppavarapu Venkaiah Naidu (born 1 July 1949) is an Indian politician who served as the vice president of India from 2017 to 2022. He has also served as the minister of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, Urban Development and Information and Broadcasting in the Modi Cabinet.

Naidu has also served as the national president of Bharatiya Janata Party from 2002 to 2004. Earlier, he was the Union Cabinet Minister for Rural Development in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. He took the oath as the vice president of India and the chairman of the Rajya Sabha (ex-officio as the Vice President) on 11 August 2017. In 2024, The Government of India honoured him with Padma Vibhushan, India&#x27;s second highest civilian award.

== Early life ==

Venkaiah Naidu was born on 1 July 1949 at Chavatapalem village (near Venkatachalam) in Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh, to Rangaiah Naidu and Ramanamma. He completed his schooling from Zilla Parshad High School, Bucchireddy Palem (Nellore), and pursued his bachelor&#x27;s degree in politics and diplomatic studies at V. R. College, Nellore. Later, he acquired a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law with specialisation in international law from Andhra University College of Law, Visakhapatnam. He was a &quot;swayamsevak&quot; in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and joined ABVP during his college days. He was elected as the president of the students&#x27; union of colleges affiliated with the Andhra University. He came into the spotlight for his prominent role in the Jai Andhra Movement of 1972. While Kakani Venkata Ratnam led the movement from Vijayawada, Naidu took active part in the agitation in Nellore, until it was called off a year later.

In 1974, he became the convener of Jayaprakash Narayan Chhatra Sangharsh Samiti of Andhra Pradesh. He took to the streets in protest against the Emergency and was imprisoned. From 1977 to 1980, he was president of its youth wing.

== Political career==
Both as a student leader and political figure, Naidu gained prominence as an orator who championed the cause of the farmers and the development of backward areas. His oratory skills and political activism propelled his political career, and he was elected as an MLA to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly twice from Udaygiri constituency in Nellore district in 1978 and 1983. He rose to become one of the most popular leaders of the BJP in Andhra Pradesh.

After serving in various organisational posts of the BJP at the state and national level, he was elected as a member of the Rajya Sabha from Karnataka in 1998. He was re-elected twice, in 2004 and 2010, from Karnataka. He served as the party spokesperson from 1996 to 2000, bringing to the job his panache for quirky alliterations and similes. Unlike most politicians from southern India, Naidu made an effort to master Hindi, going on to address public rallies in northern India.

After the NDA victory in the 1999 general elections, he became the Union Cabinet Minister for Rural Development in the government headed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He was known for aggressively pushing for reforms in rural development and for the many schemes introduced during this period such as the &#x27;Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana&#x27;.

== President of BJP (2002–04) ==
Naidu succeeded Jana Krishnamurthi as the National President of the Bharatiya Janata Party in 2003. On 28 January 2004, he was elected unopposed for a full three-year term. After the defeat of the BJP-led NDA in the 2004 general elections, he resigned from his post on 18 October 2004 and was succeeded by L. K. Advani. However, he remained at the forefront of the BJP as one of its senior vice-presidents and an important campaigner. Naidu raised the &quot;Special Status to Andhra Pradesh&quot; issue in Rajya Sabha (as opposition member in February 2014) and demanded special category state status to Andhra Pradesh. The Prime Minister agreed to it, though it was not included in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act.

== Minister of Urban Affairs ==
Following the victory of the BJP in the 2014 general elections, he was sworn in as the Minister for Urban Development and Parliamentary Affairs on 26 May 2014.

Naidu is also involved with the Swarna Bharat Trust, a social service organisation founded by him in Nellore. The trust runs a school for poor, orphaned and special-needs children and imparts self-employment training programsme, especially for women and youth.

He was nominated by the BJP on 29 May 2016 for the Rajya Sabha from Rajasthan and was elected.

== Vice Presidency (2017–2022) ==
On 5 July 2016, he concurrently served as Minister of Information and Broadcasting. A year later, he resigned from both offices to contest the 2017 vice presidential election. He won the election to become India&#x27;s 13th Vice President. He obtained 516 votes against UPA candidate Gopalkrishna Gandhi, who received 244 votes. As his tenure ended, Naidu decided to move back to Hyderabad with his family and declared that he will resume his career in the service of the nation. He was succeeded by Jagdeep Dhankhar on 11 August 2022.

<text>The Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce is a daily (six days per week) newspaper based in Seattle, Washington specializing in business, construction, real estate, and legal news and public notices.

== History ==
Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce was founded in the year, 1893. The newspaper began publication in 1895 as the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, later the &quot;Daily Bulletin&quot; and the &quot;Seattle Daily Bulletin&quot;. After merging with the &quot;Times&quot; in 1907 (an unrelated paper to today&#x27;s &quot;Seattle Times&quot;), it published as the &quot;Morning Times and Seattle Daily Bulletin&quot; for a year before reverting to its old name. It took the name &quot;Daily Journal of Commerce&quot; for the first time in 1919 as the &quot;Daily Journal of Commerce and the Daily Bulletin&quot;, dropping the &quot;Daily Bulletin&quot; portion two years later. &quot;Seattle&quot; was added to the paper&#x27;s name in 1924. From 1951 to 1956 the paper was published under the name &quot;Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce and Construction Record&quot;, and then as the &quot;Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce and Northwest Construction Record&quot; until 1989, when it once again became simply the &quot;Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce&quot;. 

In 2007, the &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; ran a profile about the newspaper and how it is adapting to the internet age.

The paper was printed on a four-unit, offset printing press from 1979 until July 2023 when printing transferred over to &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;&#x27; Rotary Offset Press facility in Kent. At that time the daily circulation was 1,500 copies.

<doc id="450160" wikidata="Q132201" url="?curid=450160" title="African jacana">
<text>The African jacana (Actophilornis africanus) is a wader in the family Jacanidae. It has long toes and long claws that enables it to walk on floating vegetation in shallow lakes, its preferred habitat. It is widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa. For the origin and pronunciation of the name, see Jacanidae.

==Taxonomy==
The African jacanas was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it in the genus &quot;Parra&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Parra africana&quot;. Gmelin based his description on that by the English ornithologist John Latham who in 1785 had described and illustrated the species in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Gmelin and Latham gave the locality as &quot;Africa&quot;: this was restricted to Ethiopia in 1915. The African jacana is now placed in the genus &quot;Actophilornis&quot; that was introduced in 1925 by the American ornithologist Harry C. Oberholser. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;aktē&quot; meaning &quot;river bank&quot; or &quot;coastal strand&quot;, &quot;-philos&quot; meaning &quot;-loving&quot; and &quot;ornis&quot; meaning &quot;bird&quot;.
The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The African jacanas is a conspicuous and unmistakable bird. It measures in overall length. As in other jacanas, the female is on average larger than the male. Males can weigh from , averaging and females from , averaging . Alongside the similarly-sized Madagascar jacana, this appears to be the heaviest jacana species. They have chestnut upperparts with black wingtips, rear neck, and eyestripe. The underparts are also chestnut in the adults, only in juveniles they are white with a chestnut belly patch. The blue bill extends up as a coot-like head shield, and the legs and long toes are grey.

==Behaviour==

===Food and feeding===
African jacanas feed on insects and other invertebrates picked from the floating vegetations or the surface of the water.

===Breeding===
African jacanas breed throughout sub-Saharan Africa. It is sedentary apart from seasonal dispersion. It lays four black-marked brown eggs in a floating nest.

The jacana has evolved a highly unusually polyandrous mating system, meaning that one female mates with multiple males and the male alone cares for the chicks. Such a system has evolved due to a combination of two factors: firstly, the lakes that the jacana lives on are so resource-rich that the relative energy expended by the female in producing each egg is effectively negligible. Secondly the jacana, as a bird, lays eggs, and eggs can be equally well incubated and cared for by a parent bird of either sex. This means that the rate-limiting factor of the jacana&#x27;s breeding is the rate at which the males can raise and care for the chicks. Such a system of females forming harems of males is in direct contrast to the more usual system of leks seen in animals such as stags and grouse, where the males compete and display in order to gain harems of females.

The parent that forms part of the harem is almost always the one that ends up caring for the offspring; in this case, each male jacana incubates and rears a nest of chicks. The male African jacana has therefore evolved some remarkable adaptations for parental care, such as the ability to pick up and carry chicks underneath its wings.

<doc id="450163" wikidata="Q15921525" url="?curid=450163" title="Prime Minister of Barbados">
<text>The prime minister of Barbados is the head of government of Barbados. The prime minister is appointed by the president under the terms of the Constitution. As the nominal holder of executive authority, the president holds responsibility for conducting parliamentary elections and for proclaiming one of the candidates as prime minister.

==Background==
Sir Grantley Herbert Adams was appointed Barbados&#x27; first &quot;Premier&quot; on 1 February 1953 when Barbados attained full self-government. When Barbados negotiated full political independence from Britain on 30 November 1966, the office was renamed &quot;Prime Minister.&quot; Despite the renaming, the functions of the office were not significantly changed.

==Appointment and tenure==
As a former British colony, Barbados has largely adopted British political models and follows the Westminster, or Cabinet, system of government, in which the executive branch of government is responsible to the legislature. The prime minister was historically appointed by the governor-general until 2021, and by the president of Barbados thereafter, to serve a maximum five-year term in Parliament. The president must endeavour to find a candidate acceptable to a majority in the House; if no such candidate can be found, the president must dissolve Parliament and call an election prematurely.

Incumbent prime ministers who lose their seat in a parliamentary election may not be prime minister. If the prime minister dies, as has happened on three occasions, the president appoints a replacement from Parliament to serve the remainder of the five-year term of Parliament. The prime minister must also be supported, or at least accepted, by a majority in the House of Assembly. If at any time the prime minister loses the &quot;confidence&quot; of the House, he must resign, along with the entire Cabinet. In practice, this usually reduces the prime minister&#x27;s appointment to a formality, as the parliamentary leader of the majority political party or coalition is invariably appointed. If, however, no such majority party or coalition exists, whether due to electoral fragmentation or to party realignments after an election, the president&#x27;s role becomes much more important. 

The prime minister of Barbados is technically the &quot;first among equals,&quot; whose vote in meetings of the Cabinet carries no greater weight than that of any other minister. In practice, the prime minister dominates the government. Other ministers are appointed by the president, but on the prime minister&#x27;s &quot;advice&quot;, and may be dismissed by the prime minister at any time (although hypothetically, the prime minister&#x27;s control over ministerial appointments may be tempered by the realities of coalition politics: the leader or leaders of coalition partners may insist on having a say in the matter too).

==Holders==
There were three premiers prior to independence and there have been eight prime ministers since independence.

==Responsibilities==
The prime minister advises the president, appoints ministers, controls a majority in the House of Assembly, and appoints 12 senators. Although the prime minister is appointed by the president of Barbados, they are almost always the leader of the majority party.

<doc id="450169" wikidata="Q753755" url="?curid=450169" title="Bronze-winged jacana">
<text>The bronze-winged jacana (Metopidius indicus) is a wader in the family Jacanidae. It is found across South and Southeast Asia and is the sole species in the genus &quot;Metopidius&quot;. Like other jacanas it forages on lilies and other floating aquatic vegetation, using its long feet and legs for balance. The sexes are alike but females are slightly larger and are polyandrous, maintaining a harem of males during the breeding season in the monsoon rains. Males maintain territories, with one male in the harem chosen to incubate the eggs and take care of the young. When threatened, young chicks may be carried to safety by the male under his wings.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The bronze-winged jacana was formally described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1790 and given the binomial name &quot;Parra indica&quot;. He placed it in the genus &quot;Parra&quot; along with all the other jacanas. Latham had earlier included the species in a supplement to his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot; but had not coined a scientific name. The present genus &quot;Metopidius&quot; was introduced by the German zoologist Johann Georg Wagler in 1832. The bronze-winged jacana is the only species within the genus. The name &quot;Metopidius&quot; is from the Ancient Greek word &quot;metōpidios&quot; meaning &quot;on the forehead&quot;, referring to the frontal lappet. The specific epithet &quot;indicus&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;Indian&quot;. There are no recognised subspecies. 

Like other jacanas it has 10 tail feathers and the oil gland is tufted. Many jacana species have a carpal spur that is used in territorial fights. In some species the spur is reduced but the wing bones are modified. The carpal spur is reduced to a tubercle in the bronze-winged jacana. In the genera &quot;Actophilornis&quot;, and &quot;Irediparra&quot; the radius bone is flattened and blade-like (and associated with a reduced spur) and is thought to be an adaptation either for territorial combat, or for brooding eggs and carrying young under the wings. In &quot;Metopidius&quot;, the radius curves and diverges to form a broad gap between the radius and ulna. Male jacanas, based on observations in the African jacana, incubate eggs and move their forewings under the eggs so as to hold them between the body and the wing. This behaviour known as wing-brooding may be aided by the flattened radius bone.

==Description==
Bronze-winged jacanas are rail-like, large, short tailed birds that appear dark at a distance except for the supercilium. They are in length. The sexes are similar but the females are slightly larger than the males. The wings are bronzy brown with a green sheen and have a reduced tubercular carpal spur. The head, neck and breast are black and contrast with the broad white supercilium that runs from over the eye to the back of the neck. The lower back and tail coverts are chestnut. The tail is stubby and reddish brown with black terminal band. The greenish yellow bill has a red-base to the upper mandible. A lappet or frontal shield extends up over the forehead and is reddish purple. The legs are greenish. The toes are long and the straight and the elongated nail on the hind toe is longer than the toe. Downy chicks are light brown with a dark stripe running down the nape. Young birds have brown upperparts, a rufous crown, white underparts, a buff foreneck, an undeveloped frontal shield, and may have a dull supercilium. Adults can be confused at a distance with the common moorhen (which is found in similar habitat) and with the watercock and while young can appear similar to the young of the pheasant-tailed jacana, they lack the black necklace seen in that species.
==Distribution and habitat==
The species is widely distributed across the Indian Subcontinent (but not Sri Lanka or western Pakistan) and Southeast Asia mainly in low elevations. Both this species and the pheasant-tailed jacana may be found in the same habitat. It is sedentary apart from seasonal dispersal in response to drought and rains. They are able to use wetlands covered in introduced weeds such as water hyacinth and make use of the cover provided by &quot;Ipomoea aquatica&quot; when breeding.

==Behaviour and ecology ==
Bronze-winged jacanas are found singly or in pairs foraging on aquatic vegetation. They balance on their long legs and long toes, and feed on plant material (claimed to be purely incidental), insects and other invertebrates picked from the floating vegetation or the water&#x27;s surface. Call is a wheezy piping &quot;seek-seek-seek&quot; given mostly in alarm. When threatened they sometimes hide by submerging themselves. The breeding season starts after the rains (June to September in India but occasional breeding in March rains reported in Rajasthan). Males defend territories from other males with open wing and neck stretched displays which can escalate to pecking. The territory maintenance activities are at a maximum from around 9 to 11 AM. The nest is a small platform of stems and leaves of &quot;Pistia&quot;, &quot;Nymphoides&quot;, &quot;Hydrilla&quot;, and &quot;Eichhornia&quot; placed on a mat of vegetation but eggs may also be laid directly on the leaf of a lotus plant. The usual clutch is four, the eggs are very conical, glossy brown with irregular black zig-zag markings. Incubation and care of the young is entirely left to males. The eggs hatch in 29 days. Predation rates of eggs are high, up to 94% were lost in one study to various predators including birds and turtles. Young chicks may be sheltered between the wings and carried to safety. They become independent of their father when they are about ten weeks old.

The nematode parasites &quot;Gongylonema indica&quot; and &quot;Stellocaronema alii&quot;, and the feather louse &quot;Rallicola indicus&quot; have been described from specimens of the bronze-winged jacana.

===Mating system===

Bronze-winged jacana females, like other female jacanas, are larger than males, territorial, polyandrous, and compete with other females to maintain harems of males to incubate clutches of eggs. Each female&#x27;s territory encompasses one to four males and their individual territories. Heavier males defend their territories from other males and the degree of polyandry of females is a trade-off based on the sizes of the male territories and the number of males in the harems. Females mate with multiple males, leading to intense sperm competition, and the male that receives (termed as receivers) a clutch of eggs for incubation may destroy clutches in which their paternity is in doubt. In addition to the territorial males, there may be many &quot;floater&quot; males that attempt to copulate with females. Females may copulate more often with receiver males to ensure clutch survival while also copulating with non-receivers to maintain their harem. The fitness cost of clutches destroyed by receivers is much higher than losing males from her harem. Males make a yelling call to gain the attention of females. Males yell more when in larger harems. Females appear to use yells to assess male quality, and copulate with males that yelled more.

<doc id="450170" wikidata="Q602280" url="?curid=450170" title="Governor-General of Antigua and Barbuda">
<text>The governor-general of Antigua and Barbuda is the representative of the monarch of Antigua and Barbuda, currently Charles III. The governor-general is nominated by the prime minister, and appointed by the monarch. The governor-general exercises the powers of the monarch, and thus appoints ministers, senators, judges, and ambassadors; gives royal assent to legislation; and issues writs for election. The governor-general also exercises the powers of the commander-in-chief of the Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force. The governor-general serves at His Majesty&#x27;s pleasure, although in practice is usually removed following the election of a new party into power. 

In addition to his or her legal responsibilities, the governor-general also has many community and ceremonial duties including delivering the speech from the throne at the state opening of Parliament, accepting letters of credence from foreign ambassadors, distributing various honours and decorations, and representing the state at official events. In general, the governor-general observes the conventions of the Westminster system and responsible government, maintaining political neutrality, and has to always act only on the advice of the prime minister. The governor-general is supported by a staff headed by the official secretary to the governor-general.

The position was directly preceded by the governor of Antigua, established in 1632. The position has gone under many reforms and name changes throughout the years, primarily due to what is now Antigua and Barbuda being merged into various federations and colonies. The title of governor has at various times been renamed to lieutenant governor or administrator. At its territorial peak the governor of Antigua had jurisdiction over the British Leeward Islands.

The position of governor-general was established when Antigua and Barbuda gained independence on 1 November 1981. Since independence, four people have served as governor-general–all from Antigua, and three of them being men. Most governors-general have been either former politicians or distinguished experts in various academic fields. Due to the increasing desire of Antiguans and Barbudans to distance themselves from the colonial past, the governor-general has been viewed as a &quot;de facto&quot; head of state culturally, and many have proposed that the position of governor-general replace the monarchy in the event that a republican system be adopted.

==History==
Prior to the establishment of the position of governor-general under the Constitution of Antigua and Barbuda, Antigua and Barbuda was administered by the Governor of Antigua, a position first established in 1632. In 1671, the position was replaced by a lieutenant governor with the establishment of the British Leeward Islands. From 1747 until 1816, the Leeward governor directly administered the archipelago. The position of Governor of Antigua was revived in 1816, and in 1833 the Governor of Antigua became the Governor of the Leeward Islands &quot;ex officio&quot;. The positions were merged in 1872, and in 1936, the position of administrator replaced the role. Upon the establishment of the Associated State of Antigua in 1967, the governorship was revived.
Since the position&#x27;s establishment, the prime minister has nominated the governor-general shortly after their assumption of office. A notable exception was Louise Lake-Tack, who was appointed three years after Baldwin Spencer assumed the premiership. Lake-Tack was later removed from office by the Gaston Browne administration, after the government requested her removal due to her refusing to work with the administration. Since then, the governor-general has rarely exercised his or her powers without the advice of the government.

==Appointment==

Any citizen of Antigua and Barbuda may be appointed as governor-general by the monarch. There is no set term for the governor-general, and the governor-general serves at His Majesty&#x27;s pleasure, meaning the monarch holds the right to dismiss the governor-general at any time. If there is a vacancy in the position, the monarch is the only person who may fill that vacancy. In 2007, there was a vacancy in the position after the term of Sir James Carlisle ended, and in 2014, the government successfully appealed to the monarch that Louise Lake-Tack be removed from office due to her being &quot;uncooperative&quot;.
==Constitutional role==

The governor-general has various responsibilities under the Constitution of Antigua and Barbuda. The governor-general excercises executive authority on behalf of the monarch, whom all executive powers are vested in.

===Role in parliament===

The governor-general appoints all members of the Senate. Ten appointments require the advice of the prime minister, one additional appointment must be a Barbuda resident on the advice of the prime minister, one requires the advice of the Barbuda Council, four require the advice of the leader of the opposition, and one may be appointed under his or her discretion. The governor-general may also declare a seat vacant with the advice of the person that&#x27;s advice was required to appoint them, or if the Barbuda resident senator ceases to be a resident of Barbuda.

All bills passed by Parliament must receive royal assent from the governor-general on behalf of the monarch. The governor-general may only refuse to assent if he or she deems the bill unconstitutional. The governor-general may prorogue Parliament by proclamation. After a consultation with the prime minister, the governor-general may dissolve Parliament. The governor-general may also dissolve Parliament if a vote of no-confidence passes and the prime minister does not resign after seven days or request a dissolution of Parliament. If Parliament is dissolved, the governor-general may prorogue the previous Parliament with the advice of the prime minister in an emergency. The governor-general may choose the date of a general election within three months after a dissolution of Parliament. As soon as possible after a general election, the governor-general must appoint the seventeen senators.

The governor-general chooses the boundaries of parliamentary constituencies by an order. However, at least one these constituencies must be located within Barbuda. The governor-general also appoints various members of the Constituencies Boundaries Commission with the advice of the prime minister and leader of the opposition. The governor-general, through a notice in the &quot;Gazette&quot;, may also appoint the Supervisor of Elections.

===Role in the executive===

The governor-general may appoint the prime minister, who must be a member of parliament with the confidence of the majority of members of the House of Representatives, in usual circumstances the leader of the majority party. All other ministers must also be appointed by the governor-general with the prime minister&#x27;s advice. Ministries may be created by acts of Parliament, or, if delegated, by the governor-general under the prime minister&#x27;s advice. The governor-general may assign ministers a portfolio. The governor-general may also appoint parliamentary secretaries, attorneys-general, and certain members of the Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy.

The governor-general may grant pardons, respites, or order less severe punishments to criminals. The governor-general also must appoint the director of public prosecutions under the advice of the Judicial and Legal Services Commission, in addition to various other government commissioners.

<text>The prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda is the head of government of the Antigua and Barbuda. The prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda is appointed by the Governor-General under the terms of the Constitution. 

The executive branch of government is established in section 68 of the constitution, and it is vested in the monarch. The prime minister is appointed by the Governor-General. The prime minister must either be a member of the House and the leader of the political party with the support of the majority of the House&#x27;s members; or the member of the House who, in the opinion of the Governor-General, is most likely to command the support of the majority of members of the House, if it appears to him that such party does not have an indisputable leader in the House or that no party commands the support of such a majority. Additionally, the nominee ought to be open to serving as prime minister.

== Appointment and tenure ==
The Constitution of Antigua and Barbuda regulates that the prime minister must be a member of the House of Representatives who is the leader in the House of the political party that has the support of the majority of members of the House of Representatives. If there is no party that has an undisputed leader, or no party that maintains the support of the majority of the House of Representatives, the Governor-General may appoint a member that is most likely to maintain the support of the majority of the members, and who is willing to hold the role of prime minister.

If a prime minister must be appointed while Parliament is dissolved, then, a person who was a member of the House of Representatives immediately before the dissolution may be appointed as prime minister.

== Acting prime minister ==
The Governor-General may authorize another member of the Cabinet to perform those functions (other than the functions conferred by section 74(2) of the constitution) when the Prime Minister is not present in Antigua and Barbuda or is unable to do so due to illness or because of the restrictions of section 73(4) of this Constitution. That member may perform those functions until the Governor-General revokes his authority.

==Responsibilities==
The prime minister advises the Governor-General on appointments to the Cabinet of Antigua and Barbuda. Only the Prime Minister or, in his absence, the Minister the Prime Minister appoints in that regard, may call the Cabinet to order. Under section 73 of the constitution, the Governor-General must dismiss the Prime Minister or dissolve parliament in the event of a successful vote of no confidence.

<text>The insect order Zoraptera, commonly known as angel insects, contains small and soft bodied insects with two forms: winged with wings sheddable as in termites, dark and with eyes (compound) and ocelli (simple); or wingless, pale and without eyes or ocelli. They have a characteristic nine-segmented beaded (moniliform) antenna. They have mouthparts adapted for chewing and are mostly found under bark, in dry wood or in leaf litter.
== Description ==

The name Zoraptera, given by Filippo Silvestri in 1913, is misnamed and potentially misleading: &quot;zor&quot; is Greek for pure and &quot;aptera&quot; means wingless. &quot;Pure wingless&quot; clearly does not fit the winged alate forms, which were discovered several years after the wingless forms had been described.

The members of this order are small insects, or less in length, that resemble termites in appearance and in their gregarious behavior. They are short and swollen in appearance. They belong to the hemimetabolous insects. They possess mandibulated biting mouthparts, short cerci (usually 1 segment only), and short antennae with 9 segments. The abdomen is segmented in 11 sections. The maxillary palps have five segments, labial palps three, in both the most distal segment is enlarged. They have six Malpighian tubules, and their abdominal ganglia have fused into two separate ganglionic complexes. Immature nymphs resemble small adults. Each species shows polymorphism. Most individuals are the apterous form or &quot;morph&quot;, with no wings, no eyes, and no or little pigmentation. A few females and even fewer males are in the alate form with relatively large membranous wings that can be shed at a basal fracture line. Alates also have compound eyes and ocelli, and more pigmentation. This polymorphism can be observed already as two forms of nymphs. Wingspan can be up to , and the wings can be shed spontaneously. When observed, wings are paddle shaped and have simple venation. Under good conditions the blind and wingless form predominates, but if their surroundings become too tough, they produce offspring which develop into winged adults with eyes. These winged offspring are then able to disperse and establish new colonies in areas with more resources. Once established, future generations are once again born blind and wingless.

== Systematics ==

=== Phylogeny ===
The phylogenetic relationship of the order remains controversial and elusive. At present the best supported position based on morphological traits recognizes the Zoraptera as polyneopterous insects related to the webspinners of the order Embioptera. However, molecular analysis of 18s ribosomal DNA supports a close relationship with the superorder Dictyoptera.

The following cladogram, based on the molecular phylogeny of Wipfler et al. 2019, places Zoraptera as the sister group of Dermaptera (earwigs); Zoraptera and Dermaptera together form the sister group of the remaining Polyneoptera:

=== Classification ===
The Zoraptera are currently divided into two families, four subfamilies, nine genera and a total of 51 species, some of which have not been yet described. There are eleven extinct species known as of 2017, many of the fossil species are known from Burmese amber.

== Behavior and ecology ==
Zorapterans live in small colonies beneath rotting wood, lacking in mouthparts able to tunnel into wood, but feeding on fungal spores and detritus. These insects can also hunt smaller arthropods like mites and collembolans. Much of their time is spent grooming themselves or others.

&quot;Centrozoros gurneyi&quot; lives in colonies which range in size from a few dozen to several hundred individuals, but most often number about 30 individuals. The males are slightly larger than the females, and they fight for dominance.

When two colonies of &quot;Usazoros hubbardi&quot; are brought together experimentally, there is no difference in behavior towards members of the new colony. Therefore, colonies in the wild might merge easily. Winged forms are rare. The males in most colonies establish a linear dominance hierarchy in which age or duration of colony membership is the prime factor determining dominance. Males appearing later in colonies are at the bottom of the hierarchy, regardless of their body size. By continually attacking other males, the dominant male monopolizes a harem of females. The members of this harem stay clumped together. There is a high correlation between rank and reproductive success of the males.

&quot;Latinozoros barberi&quot; lack such a dominance structure but display complex courtship behavior including nuptial feeding. The males possess a cephalic gland that opens in the middle of their head. During courtship they secrete a fluid from this gland and offer it to the female. Acceptance of this droplet by the female acts as behavioral releaser and immediately leads to copulation.

In &quot;Spermozoros impolitus&quot;, copulation does not occur, but fertilization is accomplished instead by transfer of a spermatophore from the male to the female. This spermatophore contains a single giant sperm cell, which unravels to about the same length as the female herself, . It is thought that this large sperm cell prevents fertilization by other males, by physically blocking the female&#x27;s genital tract.

=== Effects on ecosystem ===
Zorapterans are thought to provide some important services to ecosystems. By consuming detritus, such as dead arthropods, they assist in decomposition and nutrient cycling.

<text>Arthur William Radford (27 February 1896 – 17 August 1973) was an admiral and naval aviator of the United States Navy. In over 40 years of military service, Radford held a variety of positions including the vice chief of Naval Operations, commander of the United States Pacific Fleet and later the second chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

With an interest in ships and aircraft from a young age, Radford saw his first sea duty aboard the battleship during World War I. In the inter-war period he earned his pilot wings and rose through the ranks in duties aboard ships and in the Bureau of Aeronautics. After the U.S. entered World War II, he was the architect of the development and expansion of the Navy&#x27;s aviator training programs in the first years of the war. In its final years he commanded carrier task forces through several major campaigns of the Pacific War.

Noted as a strong-willed and aggressive leader, Radford was a central figure in the post-war debates on U.S. military policy, and was a staunch proponent of naval aviation. As commander of the Pacific Fleet, he defended the Navy&#x27;s interests in an era of shrinking defense budgets, and was a central figure in the &quot;Revolt of the Admirals,&quot; a contentious public fight over policy. As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he continued to advocate for aggressive foreign policy and a strong nuclear deterrent in support of the &quot;New Look&quot; policy of President Dwight Eisenhower.

Retiring from the military in 1957, Radford continued to be a military adviser to several prominent politicians until his death in 1973. For his extensive service, he was awarded many military honors, and was the namesake of the .

==Early life==
Arthur William Radford was born on 27 February 1896 in Chicago, Illinois, to John Arthur Radford, a Canadian-born electrical engineer, and Agnes Eliza Radford (née Knight). The eldest of four children, he was described as bright and energetic in his youth. When Arthur was six years old the family moved to Riverside, Illinois, where his father took a job as a managing engineer with Commonwealth Edison Company. John Radford managed the first steam turbine engines in the United States, at the Fisk Street Generating Station.

Arthur began his school years at Riverside Public School, where he expressed an interest in the United States Navy from a young age. He gained an interest in aviation during a visit to the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair in St. Louis, Missouri. By fourth grade, he frequently drew detailed cross-section diagrams of the . He was shy, but performed very well in school. In mid-1910, Radford moved with his family to Grinnell, Iowa, and attended Grinnell High School for a year and a half, before deciding to apply to the United States Naval Academy. He obtained the local congressman&#x27;s recommendation for an appointment to the academy, and was accepted. After several months of tutoring at Annapolis, Maryland, he entered the academy in July 1912, at the age of sixteen.

Although Radford&#x27;s first year at the academy was mediocre he applied himself to his studies in his remaining years there. He participated in summer cruises to Europe in 1913 and 1914 and passed through the Panama Canal to San Francisco in 1916. Radford, known as &quot;Raddie&quot; to his fellow students, graduated 59th of 177 in the class of 1916, and was commissioned as an ensign in the U.S. Navy during the First World War.

==Military career==
Radford&#x27;s first duty was aboard the battleship , as it escorted a transatlantic convoy to France in 1918. In his second post he was an aide-de-camp to a battleship division commander, and in his third, a flag lieutenant for another battleship division commander.
In 1920, Radford reported to Pensacola, Florida, for flight training, and was promoted to lieutenant soon thereafter. During the 1920s and 1930s his sea duty alternated among several aircraft squadrons, fleet staffs, and tours in the U.S. with the Bureau of Aeronautics. It was during this time, while he served under Rear Admiral William Moffett, that he frequently interacted with politicians and picked up the political acumen that would become useful later in his career. While he did not attend the Naval War College, as other rising officers did, Radford established himself as an effective officer who would speak his mind frankly, even to superiors.

Radford achieved the rank of lieutenant commander by 1927, and served with aircraft units aboard , , and . In 1936, he was promoted to commander and took charge of fighter squadron VF-1B aboard . By 1938, he was given command of Naval Air Station Seattle in Seattle, Washington. On 15 April 1938, while flying Grumman SF-1, BuNo 9465, CDR Radford suffered a noseover mishap at Oakland Airport following a mechanical failure of the landing gear. Radford and passenger ACMM S.H. Ryan were uninjured and the aircraft was repaired. On 22 April 1939, he married Miriam J. (Ham) Spencer at Vancouver Barracks, Washington. Spencer (1895–1997) was a daughter of George Ham of Portland, Oregon, and the former wife of (1) Albert Cressey Maze (1891–1943), with whom she had a son, Robert Claude Maze Sr., Major, USMC who was killed in action in 1945 and (2) Earl Winfield Spencer Jr. In May 1940, Radford was appointed executive officer of the , a post he served in for one year.

In July 1941, Radford was appointed commander of the Naval Air Station in Trinidad, British West Indies. He protested this appointment because he feared he would remain there for years, sidelined as World War II loomed. He only remained in this station for three months, following an organizational shift in the Bureau of Aeronautics. By mid-1941, thanks to a large expansion in the naval aviator program, squadrons could no longer train newly arrived aviators. Further, at that time, the vast difference in the performance of combat aircraft over training aircraft meant that pilots needed more time in combat aircraft before becoming proficient in them. Radford was subsequently visited by Artemus L. Gates, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air. The latter was so impressed that he ordered Rear Admiral John H. Towers, chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, to transfer Radford to a newly formed training division.

===World War II===
====Aviation Training Division====
Radford took command of the Aviation Training Division in Washington, D.C., on 1 December 1941, seven days before the attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into World War II. He was appointed as Director of Aviation Training for both the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations and the Bureau of Navigation; the double appointment helped to centralize training coordination for all naval aviators. With the U.S. mobilizing for war, Radford&#x27;s office worked long hours six days a week in an effort to build up the necessary training infrastructure as quickly as possible. For several months, this around-the-clock work took up all of his time, and he later noted that walking to work was his only form of exercise for several months. During this time, he impressed colleagues with a direct and no-nonsense approach to work, while maintaining a demeanor that made him easy to work for. He was promoted to captain soon after.

Throughout 1942 he established and refined the administrative infrastructure for aviation training. Radford oversaw the massive growth of the training division, establishing separate sections for administration; Physical Training Service Schools; and training devices; and sections to train various aviators in flight, aircraft operation, radio operation, and gunnery. The section also organized technical training and wrote training literature. He also engineered the establishment of four field commands for pilot training. Air Primary Training Command commanded all pre-flight schools and Naval reserve aviation bases in the country. Air Intermediate Training Command administered Naval Air Station Pensacola and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi where flight training was conducted. Air Operational Training Command was in charge of all education of pilots between pilot training and their first flying assignments. Finally, Air Technical Training Command trained enlisted men for support jobs in aviation such as maintenance, engineering, aerography, and parachute operations. Radford sought to integrate his own efficient leadership style into the organization of these schools.

Radford was noted for thinking progressively and innovatively to establish the most effective and efficient training programs. He sought to integrate sports conditioning programs into naval aviator training. Radford brought in athletic directors from Ohio State University, Harvard University and Penn State University under football player and naval aviator Tom Hamilton, to whom he gave the remit to develop the conditioning programs. Radford also suggested integrating women into intricate but repetitive tasks, such as running flight simulators. When commanders rejected the idea of bringing women into the service, he convinced Congressman Carl Vinson, chair of the House Naval Affairs Committee of the merit of the idea. This effort eventually led to the employment of the &quot;Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service&quot;, and 23,000 WAVES would assist in aeronautical training in the course of the war. Radford also sought to best use the assets of businessmen and professionals who had volunteered for military service, establishing the Aviation Indoctrination School and Air Combat Intelligence School at Naval Air Station Quonset Point so as to enable these advanced recruits to become more experienced naval officers.

====Sea duty====

By early 1943, with Radford&#x27;s training programs established and functioning efficiently, he sought combat duty. In April of that year, he was ordered to report to the office of Commander, Naval Air Forces, Pacific Fleet where he was promoted to rear admiral and tapped to be a carrier division commander. This was an unusual appointment, as most carrier division commanders were appointed only after duty commanding a capital ship. He then spent May and June 1943 on an inspection party under Gates, touring U.S. bases in the south Pacific. Following this, he was assigned under Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman, commander of Carrier Division 2 at Pearl Harbor. Radford spent several weeks observing flight operations and carrier tactics for various ships operating out of Hawaii. He was particularly impressed with how carrier doctrine had evolved in the time since his own assignment on a carrier, and in June 1943, he was ordered to observe operations on the light aircraft carrier , learning the unique challenges of using light carriers.

On 21 July 1943, Radford was given command of Carrier Division Eleven, which consisted of the new &quot;Essex&quot;-class carrier as well as the light carriers USS &quot;Independence&quot; and . These carriers remained at Pearl Harbor through August, training and refining their operations. Radford got his first operational experience on 1 September 1943, covering a foray to Baker and Howland Islands as part of Task Force 11 under Rear Admiral Willis A. Lee. Radford commanded &quot;Princeton&quot;, and four destroyers to act as a covering force for Lee&#x27;s marines, who built an airfield on the islands. After this successful operation, and at the direction of Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Task Force 11 was joined by Task Force 15, with &quot;Lexington&quot;, under Rear Admiral Charles A. Pownall. The two task forces then steamed for Tarawa Atoll to strike it. On the night of 17 September, the carriers launched six strikes of fighter aircraft, dive bombers, and torpedo planes to work over the Japanese defenses.

Next, Radford and his carriers took part in an air attack and cruiser bombardment of Wake Island on 5 to 6 October 1943. He shifted his flag to &quot;Lexington&quot; for the operation, which took two days. Though the effects on Japanese positions were not known, Radford and other leaders considered the operations useful for preparing their forces for the major battles to come in the Central Pacific.

====Major combat operations====
Major operations in the Central Pacific began that November. Radford&#x27;s next duty was in Operation Galvanic, a campaign into the Gilbert Islands with the objective of capturing Tarawa as well as Makin Island and Apamama Atoll. It would be one of the first times that American carriers would be operating against Japanese land-based air power in force, as U.S. Army troops and U.S. Marines fought the Japanese on the ground. For this mission, Radford&#x27;s carrier division was designated Task Group 50.2, the Northern Carrier Group, which consisted of , and . He did not agree with this strategy, maintaining until his death that the force should have gone on an offensive to strike Japanese air power instead of being tied to the ground forces. Despite his objections, the force left Pearl Harbor for the Gilbert Islands on 10 November.

The invasion began on 20 November. Radford&#x27;s force was occupied with air strikes on Japanese ground targets, and faced frequent attack by Japanese aircraft in night combat, which U.S. aircrews were not well prepared or equipped for. He improvised a unit to counter Japanese night raids, and was later credited with establishing routines for nighttime combat air patrols to protect carriers; these were adopted fleetwide. He commanded Carrier Division Eleven around Tarawa for several more days, returning to Pearl Harbor on 4 December.

Returning from Tarawa, Radford was reassigned as chief of staff to Towers, who was Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet. He assisted in planning upcoming operations, including Operation Flintlock, the invasion of the Marshall Islands. He had hoped to return to combat duty at the end of this assignment, but in March 1944 he was ordered to Washington, D.C., and appointed as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. He assumed this new duty on 1 April, a role which was primarily administrative in nature. His duties included establishing a new integrated system for aircraft maintenance, supply, and retirement, for which he was appointed the head of a board to study aircraft wear and tear. After six months in this duty, Radford was returned to the Pacific theater by Admiral Ernest J. King, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Commander in Chief, United States Fleet.

Radford returned to Pearl Harbor on 7 October 1944, where he was appointed as commander of First Carrier Task Force, Carrier Division Six. While flying to his new command, he was held over in Kwajalein and then Saipan, missing the Battle of Leyte Gulf which took place in the Philippines during the layover. He flew to Ulithi where he reported to Vice Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., commander of Task Force 58. For the next two months, Radford remained on &quot;make learn&quot; status, again under Sherman&#x27;s command, observing the operations and employment of carrier-based air power as a passenger aboard , part of Task Group 38.3. During this time, he observed the strikes on Luzon and the Visayas, as well as air attacks on Japanese shipping and Typhoon Cobra.
On 29 December 1944, Radford was unexpectedly ordered to take command of Task Group 38.1 after its commander, Rear Admiral Alfred E. Montgomery, was injured. The next day the fleet sortied from Ulithi and headed for scheduled air strikes on Luzon and Formosa (Taiwan). Throughout January 1945, Radford&#x27;s fleet operated in the South China Sea striking Japanese targets in French Indochina and Hong Kong. In February, the U.S. Third Fleet was re-designated the U.S. Fifth Fleet, and as a part of this reorganization Radford&#x27;s force was redesignated Task Group 58.4. He continued striking Japanese targets in the Inland Sea during March. On 1 April, the force was moved to support the Battle of Okinawa. Over the course of the next two months, his force continued its use of night raids, which by this point were effective in repelling Japanese attacks on U.S. Navy ships. After two months supporting ground forces on Okinawa, Radford&#x27;s fleet was detached from that operation.

Returning to the Third Fleet and being re-designated Task Group 38.4, the force began operating off the Japanese Home Islands in July 1945. It began an intense airstrike campaign against military targets on Honshu and Hokkaido, striking Japanese airfields, merchant shipping, and ground targets. Radford commanded the force in this duty until V-J Day, the end of the war in the Pacific. Upon receipt of the orders to end hostilities, he signaled his ships that he was proud of their accomplishments.

===Post-war years===
Radford was promoted to vice admiral in late 1945. For a time he was Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air under Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal. During the post-war period, Radford was a strong advocate that naval aviation programs be maintained. When Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King issued a post-war plan calling for the U.S. to maintain nine active aircraft carriers, Radford suggested he double the number, a politically unrealistic proposal.

After the war, Radford was a principal opponent to a plan to merge the uniformed services. A plan existed to split the Army and the Army Air Forces into separate branches and unite them and the Navy under one Cabinet-level defense organization. Fearing the loss of their branch&#x27;s influence, Navy commanders opposed the formation of a separate Air Force and favored a more loose defense organization. Radford was picked by Forrestal to form the Secretary&#x27;s Committee of Research and Reorganization. Months of discussion resulted in the National Security Act of 1947, a political victory for the Navy because it created the U.S. Air Force while resulting in a coordinated, not unified, U.S. Department of Defense with limited power and with the Navy maintaining control of its air assets. In 1947, Radford was briefly appointed commander of the Second Task Fleet, a move he felt was to distance him from the budget negotiations in Washington, but nonetheless preferred.

In 1948, Radford was appointed by President Harry S. Truman as the Vice Chief of Naval Operations (VCNO). Debates continued with military leaders about the future of the United States Armed Forces as Truman sought to trim the defense budget. Radford was relied on by Navy leaders as an expert who would fiercely defend the Navy&#x27;s interests from budget restrictions, but his appointment as VCNO was opposed by Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, who feared his hard-line stance on the budget would alienate the generals in the other branches of the military. Some historians contend Radford brought strong leadership to the role. Naval aviation assets grew from 2,467 aircraft to 3,467 during this time, almost all aircraft for fast-attack carriers. He also oversaw the implementation of the &quot;Full Air Program&quot; which envisioned 14,500 total aircraft in the naval air force. Along with his predecessor John Dale Price, he favored reducing naval ship strength in order to develop stronger naval aviation capabilities. Then, in 1949, Truman appointed him as the High Commissioner of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

==Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet==
In April 1949, Truman appointed Radford to the position of Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. A staunch anticommunist, Radford saw the greatest threat to U.S. security coming from Asia, not Europe. He traveled extensively throughout the Pacific as well as South Asia and the Far East. He became acquainted with political and military leaders in New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaya, Burma, India, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Formosa, and Japan, and learned about the sociopolitical issues facing each nation and the region as a whole.

===&quot;Revolt of the Admirals&quot;===

Despite his new office, Radford was soon recalled to Washington to continue hearings on the future of the U.S. military budget. He became a key figure in what would later be called the &quot;Revolt of the Admirals&quot;, which took place during April 1949 when the supercarrier was cancelled.

At the request of Congressman Carl Vinson, Radford strongly opposed plans by Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson and Secretary of the Navy Francis P. Matthews to make the Convair B-36 the Air Force&#x27;s principal bomber aircraft, calling it a &quot;billion dollar blunder.&quot; Radford also questioned the Air Force&#x27;s plan to focus on nuclear weapons delivery capabilities as its primary deterrent to war and called nuclear war &quot;morally reprehensible&quot;. While the &quot;United States&quot; remained cancelled and the post-war cuts to the Navy were intact, funding was increasing during the Cold War era for conventional forces.

===Korean War===
Shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, control of Vice Admiral Arthur D. Struble&#x27;s U.S. Seventh Fleet was transferred from Radford to Vice Admiral C. Turner Joy, who was serving as Commander, Naval Forces, Far East. Joy&#x27;s superior was General of the Army Douglas MacArthur of the United Nations Command Korea (UNC). As such, Radford exercised no direct responsibility over forces involved in the conflict.

Radford was an admirer of MacArthur and a proponent of his &quot;Asia First&quot; strategy. He supported Operation Chromite in October 1950, as well as the United Nations mission of Korean reunification. He attended the Wake Island Conference between MacArthur and Truman on 15 October, and later recalled his belief that, should the Chinese intervene in the war, the U.S. could still prevail provided it was able to strike Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army bases in Manchuria with air power. When the People&#x27;s Volunteer Army did intervene in favor of North Korea the next month, Radford shared MacArthur&#x27;s frustration at restrictions placed on the UN force in the war preventing it from striking Chinese soil. Once Truman relieved MacArthur in April 1951, Radford reportedly gave the general a &quot;hero&#x27;s welcome&quot; in Hawaii as he was returning to the United States.

As commander of U.S. forces in the Philippines and Formosa, Radford accompanied President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower on his three-day trip to Korea in December 1952. Eisenhower was looking for an exit strategy for the stalemated and unpopular war, and Radford suggested threatening China with attacks on its Manchurian bases and the use of nuclear weapons. This view was shared by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and UNC Commanding General Mark W. Clark, but had not been acted on when the armistice came in July 1953, at a time when the Chinese were struggling with domestic unrest. Still, Radford&#x27;s frankness during the trip and his knowledge of Asia made a good impression on Eisenhower, who nominated Radford to be his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

==Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff==

Eisenhower&#x27;s official nomination for Radford came in mid-1953. Eisenhower was initially cautious about him because of his involvement in the inter-service rivalry and &quot;revolt&quot; in 1949. Radford&#x27;s anticommunist views, however, as well as his knowledge of Asia and his support of Eisenhower&#x27;s &quot;New Look&quot; defense policy, made him an attractive nominee, particularly among Republicans, to replace Omar Bradley. Eisenhower was also impressed with his &quot;intelligence, dedication, tenacity, and courage to speak his mind.&quot; During his nomination, Radford indicated a changed outlook from the positions he had taken during the &quot;Revolt of the Admirals&quot;. As chairman, he was eventually popular with both the president and Congress.

===Military budget===

Radford was integral in formulating and executing the &quot;New Look&quot; policy, reducing spending on conventional military forces to favor a strong nuclear deterrent and a greater reliance on airpower. In this time, he had to overcome resistance from Army leaders who opposed the reduction of their forces, and Radford&#x27;s decisions, unfettered by inter-service rivalry, impressed Eisenhower. In spite of his support of the &quot;New Look&quot;, he disagreed with Eisenhower on several occasions when the president proposed drastic funding cuts that Radford worried would render the U.S. Navy ineffective. In late 1954, for example, Radford testified privately before a congressional committee that he felt some of Eisenhower&#x27;s proposed defense cuts would limit the military&#x27;s capability for &quot;massive retaliation&quot;, but he kept his disagreements out of public view, working from within and seeking the funding to save specific strategic programs.

In 1956, Radford proposed protecting several military programs from funding cuts by reducing numbers of conventional forces, but the proposal was leaked to the press, causing an uproar in Congress and among U.S. military allies, and the plan was dropped. In 1957, after the other Joint Chiefs of Staff again disagreed on how to downsize force levels amid more budget restrictions, Radford submitted ideas for less dramatic force downsizing directly to Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson, who agreed to pass them along to Eisenhower.

===Foreign military policy===
While Radford remained Eisenhower&#x27;s principal adviser for the budget, they differed on matters of foreign policy. Radford advocated the use of nuclear weapons and a firm military and diplomatic stance against China. Early in his tenure, he suggested to Eisenhower a preventive war against China or the Soviet Union while the U.S. possessed a nuclear advantage and before it became entangled in conflicts in the Far East. Eisenhower immediately dismissed this idea.

After France requested U.S. assistance for its beleaguered force at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, Radford suggested an aggressive stance toward the Viet Minh by promoting Operation Vulture in which 60 U.S. Air Force B-29 Superfortress bombers would conduct airstrikes on Viet Minh positions. Radford even believed in the U.S. threaten it with nuclear weapons, like earlier with the Chinese in Korea. He also advocated U.S. military intervention in the 1955 First Taiwan Strait Crisis and the 1956 Suez Crisis, but Eisenhower favored diplomatic approaches and threats of force.

==Later life==

After his second term as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Radford opted to retire from the Navy in 1957 to enter the private sector. The same year Radford High School in Honolulu was named in his honor. Radford was called upon to serve as military campaign advisor for Richard Nixon in the 1960 presidential election, and again for Barry Goldwater in the 1964 election.

Radford died of cancer at age 77 on 17 August 1973 at Bethesda Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. He is buried with his wife Miriam J. Radford (1895–1997) at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. In 1975, the Navy launched the anti-submarine , named in his honor.

<text>The pheasant-tailed jacana (Hydrophasianus chirurgus) is a jacana in the monotypic genus Hydrophasianus. Like all other jacanas, they have elongated toes and nails that enable them to walk on floating vegetation in shallow lakes, their preferred habitat. They may also swim or wade in water reaching their body while foraging mainly for invertebrate prey. They are found in tropical Asia from Yemen in the west to the Philippines in the east and move seasonally in parts of their range. They are the only jacanas that migrate long distances and have different non-breeding and breeding plumages. The pheasant-tailed jacana forages by swimming or by walking on aquatic vegetation. Females are larger than males and are polyandrous, laying several clutches that are raised by different males in their harem.

==Description==

The pheasant-tailed jacana is conspicuous and unmistakable. It is the longest species in the jacana family when the tail streamers are included. The breeding plumage is marked by the elongated central tail feathers that given the bird its name. The body is chocolate brown, the face is white, and the back of the crown is black with white stripes running down the sides of the neck, separating the white of the front of neck and the silky golden yellow of the nape. The wings are predominantly white. In flight the white wing shows a black border formed by black on the outermost primaries and the tips of the outer secondaries and the primaries. The wing coverts are pale brown and the scapulars may be glossed green or purple. In the non-breeding season the top of the head and back are dark brown and only a trace of the golden nape feathers may be seen. A dark eyestripe runs down the sides of the neck and forms a dark necklace on a slightly sullied white front. The outer two primaries have a slender (lanceolate or spatulate) extension that broadens at the tip. The fourth primary has an acute tip formed by the shaft after the loss of webbing. Young birds have brown upper parts and the dark necklace is broken. Some traces of the black stripe on the side of the neck and white wings separate them from somewhat similar looking immatures of the bronze-winged jacana. They have strongly developed sharp white carpal spurs which are longer in females. The spurs may also undergo moult, but this has not been specifically described in this species. The tail is short and strongly graduated. The bill is more slender than in the bronze-winged and is bluish-black with a yellow tip when breeding and dull brown with yellowish base when not breeding. The legs are dark bluish grey and the iris is brown.

Shufeldt described the skeletal features of a specimen from Luzon as being typical of jacanas except that the skull resembles in some ways those of sandpipers. The skull and mandibles are slightly pneumatized, unlike the other bones, and the sternum has a notch on the side which serve as attachment points to long and slender xiphoidal processes.

==Taxonomy and systematics ==

The pheasant-tailed jacana was described by the French explorer Pierre Sonnerat in his 1776 &quot;Voyage à la Nouvelle Guinée&quot;, in which he included an illustration of the bird that he called &quot;Le Chirurgien de l&#x27;Isle de Luzon&quot; or the surgeon of the island of Luzon. He described a bird with the long toes and the elongated feather extensions resembling the lancets used for blood-letting by surgeons of the period. Based on this description, the bird was given a binomial by Giovanni Scopoli in 1787 in his &quot;Deliciae Florae et Faunae Insubricae&quot; (Pars II), where he placed it in the genus &quot;Tringa&quot;. He retained the name &quot;chirurgus&quot; for the specific name. It was later placed in the genus &quot;Parra&quot; (under the junior synonym &quot;Parra luzonensis&quot;) along with other jacanas, and later still, the genera within the jacana family (then called Parridae) were separated.

The genus &quot;Hydrophasianus&quot;, meaning &quot;water pheasant&quot;, was erected by Johann Georg Wagler in 1832 as the species was distinctive in having a slender bill, lacking any frontal lappet, having a shorter hind claw than &quot;Metopidius&quot;, bearing on the outer two primaries lanceolate elongations, and having a pointed fourth primary. The distinct breeding and non-breeding plumage is unique within the jacanas.

=== Measurements ===
The following are standard measurements from a study based on living specimens during the breeding season in Thailand. They are averaged from 17 males and 4 females. A few measurements are from Rasmussen and Anderton (2005), where the head measurement (range given rather than mean) is from the tip of the bill to the back of the skull.
Body mass measurements can vary widely based on physiological conditions and are generally not used for taxonomic purposes. A dataset from the Philippines gives the body mass ranges as in males and in females.

==Distribution and habitat==

The pheasant-tailed jacana is a resident breeder in tropical India, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia; it overlaps greatly in range with the bronze-winged jacana, but, unlike the bronze-winged jacana, is found in Sri Lanka. It is found on small to large lakes having sufficient floating vegetation. It is sedentary in much of its range, but northern breeders from south China and the Himalayas migrate south from their breeding ranges to Southeast Asia and peninsular India, respectively. In Nanking, the birds leave in November and return for summer in the third week of April. Some birds arrive in the non-breeding plumage. The species is resident in Taiwan, where it is considered endangered. Birds disperse in summer and have been recorded as vagrants in Socotra, Qatar, Australia and southern Japan (mainly Okinawa, Yonaguni, Ishigaki and Iriomote). The species tends to be commoner in lower elevations but climbs into the Himalayas in summer, and records exist of the species from altitudes of 3650 m in Kashmir (Vishansar Lake) and 3800 m in Lahul.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The pheasant-tailed jacana&#x27;s main sources of food are insects, molluscs, and other invertebrates picked from floating vegetation or the water&#x27;s surface. It forages by walking on vegetation and also by swimming in water, somewhat like phalaropes (although Hoffmann claims that they wade in deeper water but never swim). It also ingests filamentous algae, seeds and plant material, but this may be purely accidental. Flocks of as many as 50 to 100 can be found on a body of water, and they can become tame and habituated to human presence. They usually fly low over the water surface but may also mob raptors higher in the air. On landing, they keep their wings open until they find firm footing.

The typical call is a mewing &#x27; or a nasal &#x27; among winter flocks. Males and females have different calls during the breeding season, and several contextual variants exist. Young birds produce a low cheep with the bill closed.

===Breeding===

This jacana breeds on floating vegetation during the rainy season. In southern India, it breeds in the monsoon season, June–September. It is polyandrous; one female may lay up to ten clutches in a single season that are raised by different males. Female court males with flight displays around the males and with calling. The female builds a nest on floating vegetation made of leaves and stalks of plants with a depression in the centre. A single clutch consists of four glossy black-marked dark-olive-brown eggs (occasionally an egg in a clutch may be an odd pale sea-green in colour) which are laid in the mornings at 24 hour intervals. When an egg is removed at the one- or two-egg stage, the nest is torn down and a new one built, whereas a removal at the three-egg stage does not result in replacement. Once the clutch of four is laid, the male begins incubation and the female leaves to court a different male. In a study in Thailand it was found that it took a female 17 to 21 days to lay the next clutch. A study in China found females taking 9–12 days and laying nearly 7 to 10 clutches in a season. Males may move or drag eggs around by holding them between the bill and breast or between the wings and body. They may also push and float the eggs over water and onto nearby vegetation platforms when disturbed. Nests may be moved to distances of about 15 metres.
 Males near the nest may perform broken-wing and rodent-run displays to distract predators. The eggs are incubated for 26 to 28 days. During the first few days of incubation, the female defends the nest, chasing other waterbirds that may approach too close by flying at them. In close territorial combat they lock bills and strike simultaneously with both wings. Males actively forage in the morning and afternoon and tend to sit at the nest during the hottest part of the day. The downy nidifugous chicks freeze when threatened or when the male indicates alarm and may lie partly submerged with just the bill out of water.

Eggs may be preyed on by pond herons, while chicks may bet taken by birds of prey such as black-winged kites. The trematode parasite &quot;Renicola philippinensis&quot; was described from the kidney of a pheasant-tailed jacana in the New York Zoological Garden while &quot;Cycloceolum brasilianum&quot; was recorded in India. The bird louse species &quot;Rallicola sulcatus&quot; has been described from this species; it looks very similar to &quot;Rallicola indicus&quot; from the bronze-winged jacana. Another bird louse known from the species is &quot;Pseudomenopon pilosum&quot;.

== In culture ==
The pheasant-tailed jacana is commonly distributed in lily ponds in Sri Lanka and on account of its mewing call is known as the &quot;cat teal&quot; or juana in Sinhalese. In Cachar district of Assam, it is known by the name , which translates to &quot;little white water princess&quot;.

<text>Großostheim (or &quot;Grossostheim&quot;) is a market community in the Aschaffenburg district in the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Lower Franconia (&quot;Unterfranken&quot;) in Bavaria, Germany. The inhabitants call themselves &quot;Aistmer&quot; (&quot;ostheimers&quot;).

==Geography==

===Location===
Großostheim lies on the northeast edge of the Odenwald in the Bavarian Lower Main (&quot;Bayerischer Untermain&quot;) region.

===Constituent communities===

Großostheim&#x27;s &quot;Ortsteile&quot; are Großostheim, Pflaumheim, Wenigumstadt and Ringheim.

===Neighbouring communities===
Clockwise from the north, these are the community of Stockstadt, the district-free town of Aschaffenburg, the community of Niedernberg, the community of Mömlingen (both in Miltenberg district) and the community of Schaafheim (Darmstadt-Dieburg).

Together with Stockstadt am Main and the neighbouring Hessian community of Schaafheim, the market community forms the historic Bachgau region.

==History==

The market community of Großostheim, as a greater community, is made up of the constituent communities of Großostheim, Ringheim, Pflaumheim and Wenigumstadt. While Ringheim has always been part of Großostheim, the other two places, Pflaumheim and Wenigumstadt, have only been as much since municipal reform on 1 May 1978.

Ostheim, called Großostheim since the 18th century – &quot;groß&quot; is German for “great” or “big” – had its first documentary mention in a document from the Fulda Abbey dating from sometime between 780 and 799.

Ostheim belonged from the time of its first documentary mention to various lordly domains, before it passed along with the whole Bachgau to the Electorate of Mainz.

The constituent community of Ringheim gets its name from an older village that died out in the early 16th century. The &quot;Ringheimer Mühle&quot; – a mill, formerly an inn and a farmhouse – seems to be the last piece of property from the old Ringheim. The new Ringheim arose after 1945 on the lands of the former Luftwaffe base, in whose barracks and other buildings Germans driven out of their homelands were housed. Quick growth with industries locating in the new settlement has made of the initially small constituent community a considerable settlement today, which has become a desirable place to live.

The constituent community of Pflaumheim, despite lying right near the significant centre of Ostheim, had always been an independent community. It did, however, belong ecclesiastically as a branch parish to the parish of St. Peter and Paul in Großostheim. Only in 1923 did Pflaumheim, with its &quot;Kirche St. Luzia&quot; (church) become an independent parish. In 1994, Pflaumheim&#x27;s 1,200-year jubilee was celebrated, as in 794 the Pflaumgau, and in the same era Pflaumheim itself, were named in documents handed down from the Lorsch and Fulda Abbeys.

The constituent community of Wenigumstadt had its first documentary mention in 1229 as &quot;villa Omestad minore&quot;. The village had, however, surely been settled much earlier, as the many archaeological finds from Wenigumstadt show a human presence from every cultural epoch in the last 7,000 years.

The former (until 1782) Electoral Mainz Vogteiamt (&quot;Vogt&quot; district) became in 1803 part of Archbishop-Elector of Mainz Karl von Dalberg&#x27;s newly formed Electorate of Aschaffenburg, along with which, under the terms of the Treaties of Paris, it passed in 1814 (by this time it had become a department of the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt) to Bavaria.

In the course of administrative reform in Bavaria, the current community came into being with the &quot;Gemeindeedikt&quot; (“Municipal Edict”) of 1818.

==Population development==
Within the municipal area lived 12,788 inhabitants in 1970, 13,514 in 1987, 15,913 in 2000 and 16,299 in 2004.

==Politics==

The mayor is Herbert Jakob (CSU), elected in April 2014 and re-elected in 2020.

The income from municipal taxes in 1999 amounted to €9,751,000 (converted) of which net intake from business taxes amounted to €3,180,000.

===Coat of arms===
The community&#x27;s arms might be described thus: Party per fess Or and sable, a buck salient of the second langued gules and couped at the thigh, and three trefoils slipped argent.

Until the 18th century, Großostheim was known simply as Ostheim. It was in 1774 that the name Großostheim first cropped up. The coat of arms, conferred on 17 January 1911 by Prince Regent Luitpold and borne ever since, is a combination of the 17th-century community seal, which is no longer on hand, and a smaller version of the arms borne by the family Schad, whose members called themselves Schad von Ostheim. The family died out in 1581, after having lived for centuries in the Bachgau, to whose tithing district the community of Ostheim then belonged. The cloverleaves below the parting was a popular, old local symbol for agriculture. They are taken from the lost Großostheim community seal and refer to how, in the course of time, clover growing displaced winegrowing.

==Culture and sightseeing==
* The Catholic Saints Peter&#x27;s and Paul&#x27;s parish church (&quot;St. Peter und Paul&quot;) holds a “Lamentation of Christ” by Tilman Riemenschneider (1515), which is iconographically and stylistically akin to earlier work at the Hessenthal Pilgrimage Church.
* Housed today in the timber-frame &quot;Nöthig-Gut&quot; at the marketplace, a former feudal estate held by the Mainz cathedral provosts (1537–1629), is the &quot;Bachgaumuseum&quot;. The exhibits display regional crafts and agriculture in the 19th century, with a local emphasis.
* Timber-frame houses from the 16th to 18th centuries characterize the whole core of the community, on the marketplace, Marktgasse, Kanzleistraße, Haarstraße and Breite Straße. With 148 houses under monumental protection (as at 2007), Großostheim is thereby a leader in the Aschaffenburg district.
* Of the town fortifications torn down in the 19th century, all that has been left standing is the &quot;Spitzer Turm&quot; (“Sharp Tower”, a prison tower with a dungeon), the &quot;Stumpfer Turm&quot; (“Blunt Tower”, the powder tower), the &quot;Hexenturm&quot; (&quot;Witches’ Tower&quot;), in which in 1602 and 1603 eleven women were found guilty of witchcraft in the Electoral Mainz) and a small remnant of the formerly 2 km-long town wall on Grabenstraße.
* Three chapels stand in Großostheim. A local farrier, Peter Drippel, built one of these in 1517 and it was consecrated to the patron saint of his craft, Saint Eligius. The so-called &quot;Frauhäuschen&quot; is a chapel sacred to Mary (late 15th century). The most important piece of decoration at the &quot;Kreuzkapelle&quot; (“Cross Chapel”) is a Crucifixion scene by Hans Backoffen, a late work from 1513.
* In the constituent community of Pflaumheim stands the oldest town hall in the Bachgau. The timber-frame building, restored in 1981, comes from 1548. A stylistically similar town hall building from 1584 is found in the constituent community of Wenigumstadt.
* Großostheim lies on the &quot;Einhardsweg&quot;. This 77 km-long hiking and cycling trail follows Charlemagne’s biographer Einhard’s footsteps, running from Bad König to Hanau.
* Thirty-six &quot;Bildstöcke&quot; (sing. &quot;Bildstock&quot; – a cross-shaped or columnar pillar functioning as a wayside shrine) from the 16th to 18th centuries stand along the hiking and cycling trails right nearby.
* Filmed in Großostheim from 1988 to 1992 was the television series &quot;Mit Leib und Seele&quot; with regional actor Günter Strack in the main role. However, the town was known in the show as &quot;Eberfeld&quot;.

==Economy and infrastructure==
===Economy, agriculture, forestry===
According to official statistics, in 1998, there were 85 workers on the social welfare contribution rolls working in agriculture and forestry. In producing businesses this was 2,427, and in trade and transport 1,067. In other areas, 910 workers on the social welfare contribution rolls are employed, and 5,627 are remote workers. There were 9 processing businesses. Fourteen businesses are in construction, and furthermore, in 1999, there were 84 agricultural operations with a working area of 2 656 ha, of which 2 428 ha was cropland and 193 ha was meadowland. There are a brewery and several winegrowing operations here.

The best known firm in the community was the European head office of Nintendo before its closure and relocation to Frankfurt in 2015. Also, the meat processing business Salomon Foodworld is resident here.

===Transport===
Großostheim lies on &quot;Bundesstraßen&quot; 469 and 26 near Autobahn A 3. In the constituent community of Ringheim lies a regional airport. Großostheim once had passenger train service, but unfortunately that service ended in 1974 with the closing of the Bachgau railway line. The nearest major railway station is the Aschaffenburg Hauptbahnhof. Bus service to nearby towns, including Aschaffenburg, is available.

===Education===
There are the following institutions (as at 2007):
*Kindergartens: 675 kindergarten places with 652 children
*Elementary schools: 5 with 72 teachers and 1,234 pupils

==Famous people==

===Sons and daughters of the town===
* Otto Becker (1958–    ), German show jumper
* Heinrich Hock (1887–1971), German chemist
* Prof. Dr. Rudolf Schüßler (1960–    ), German (moral) philosopher

===Town partnerships===
* Carbon-Blanc, Gironde, France
* Saulxures-sur-Moselotte, Vosges, France
* Hamoir, Liège Province, Belgium

<text>Ta Prohm (, UNGEGN: , ALA-LC: ; &quot;Ancestor Brahma&quot;) is the modern name of a temple near the city of Siem Reap, Cambodia, approximately one kilometre east of Angkor Thom and on the southern edge of the East Baray. It was built in the Bayon style largely in the late 12th century and early 13th century and was originally called Rajavihara (, UNGEGN: , ALA-LC: ; &quot;Royal Monastery&quot;). It was founded by the Khmer King Jayavarman VII as a Mahayana Buddhist monastery and center of learning dedicated to his mother. Almost 80,000 people were required to maintain or attend at the temple, including over 2,700 officials and 615 dancers.

The temple is referred to as the &quot;Tomb Raider Temple&quot; or the &quot;Angelina Jolie Temple&quot; due to its depiction in the film &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; (2001).

The temple was built without mortar and, after it was abandoned, trees took root in the loosened stones. The trees growing out of the ruins and the jungle surroundings have made it one of the most popular temples with visitors to the area. It has been on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1992.

==History==

===Foundation and expansion===
In 1186 A.D., Jayavarman VII embarked on a massive program of construction and public works. Rajavihara (&quot;monastery of the king&quot;), today known as Ta Prohm (&quot;ancestor Brahma&quot;), was one of the first temples founded pursuant to that program. The stele commemorating the foundation gives a date of 1186 A.D.

Jayavarman VII constructed Rajavihara in honour of his family. The temple&#x27;s main image, representing Prajnaparamita, the personification of wisdom, was modelled on the king&#x27;s mother. The northern and southern satellite temples in the third enclosure were dedicated to the king&#x27;s guru, Jayamangalartha, and his elder brother respectively. As such, Ta Prohm formed a complementary pair with the temple monastery of Preah Khan, dedicated in 1191 A.D., the main image of which represented the Bodhisattva of compassion Lokesvara and was modelled on the king&#x27;s father.

The temple&#x27;s stele records that the site was home to more than 12,500 people (including 18 high priests and 615 dancers), with an additional 80,000 inhabitants in the surrounding villages working to provide services and supplies. The stele also notes that the temple amassed considerable riches, including gold, pearls, and silks. Expansions and additions to Ta Prohm continued as late as the rule of Srindravarman at the end of the 13th century.

===Abandonment and restoration===

After the fall of the Khmer Empire in the 15th century, the temple of Ta Prohm was abandoned and neglected for centuries. When the effort to conserve and restore the temples of Angkor began in the early 20th century, the École française d&#x27;Extrême-Orient decided that Ta Prohm would be left largely as it had been found, as a &quot;concession to the general taste for the picturesque.&quot; According to pioneering Angkor scholar Maurice Glaize, Ta Prohm was singled out because it was &quot;one of the most imposing [temples] and the one which had best merged with the jungle, but not yet to the point of becoming a part of it&quot;. Nevertheless, much work has been done to stabilize the ruins, to permit access, and to maintain &quot;this condition of apparent neglect.&quot;

In 1992, UNESCO inscribed Ta Prohm on the World Heritage List. The conservation and restoration of Ta Prohm is a partnership project of the Archaeological Survey of India and the APSARA (Authority for the Protection and Management of Angkor and the Region of Siem Reap).

By 2013, the Archaeological Survey of India restored most parts of the temple complex, some of which were constructed from scratch. Wooden walkways, platforms, and roped railings were put in place around the site to protect the monument from further damages from tourists.

In November 2022, a renovation of the Hall of Dancers was completed.

==The site==

===Layout===
The design of Ta Prohm is that of a typical &quot;flat&quot; Khmer temple, as opposed to a temple-pyramid or temple-mountain, the inner levels of which are higher than the outer. Five rectangular enclosing walls surround a central sanctuary. The sanctuary is centered around the stone face of Prajnaparamita, the personification of wisdom, modeled after the king&#x27;s mother. Like most Khmer temples, Ta Prohm is oriented to the east, so the temple proper is set back to the west along an elongated east–west axis. The outer wall of 1000 by 650 metres encloses an area of 650,000 square metres that at one time would have been the site of a substantial town, but that is now largely forested. There are entrance gopuras at each of the cardinal points, although access today is now only possible from the east and west. In the 13th century, face towers similar to those found at the Bayon were added to the gopuras. Some of the face towers have collapsed. At one time, moats could be found inside and outside the fourth enclosure. The presence of two moats led some historians to speculate that the 12th/13th remain of Ta Prohm is an expansion of a more ancient Buddhist shrine on the same site.

The three inner enclosures of the temple proper are galleried, while the corner towers of the first enclosure form a quincunx with the tower of the central sanctuary. This basic plan is complicated for the visitor by the circuitous access necessitated by the temple&#x27;s partially collapsed state, as well as by the large number of other buildings dotting the site, some of which represent later additions. The most substantial of these other buildings are the libraries in the southeast corners of the first and third enclosures; the satellite temples on the north and south sides of the third enclosure; the Hall of Dancers between the third and fourth eastern gopuras; and a House of Fire east of the fourth eastern gopura.

===Representational art===
Ta Prohm does not have many narrative bas-reliefs (as compared to Angkor Wat or Angkor Thom.) At any rate, some depictions of scenes from Buddhist mythology do remain. One badly eroded bas-relief illustrates the &quot;Great Departure&quot; of Siddhartha, the future Buddha, from his father&#x27;s palace. The temple also features stone reliefs of devatas (minor female deities), meditating monks or ascetics, and dvarapalas or temple guardians.

===Trees===
The trees growing out of the ruins are perhaps the most distinctive feature of Ta Prohm, and &quot;have prompted more writers to descriptive excess than any other feature of Angkor.&quot; Two species predominate, but sources disagree on their identification: the larger is either the silk-cotton tree (&quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot;) or thitpok &quot;Tetrameles nudiflora&quot;, and the smaller is either the strangler fig (&quot;Ficus gibbosa&quot;) or gold apple (&quot;Diospyros decandra&quot;). Angkor scholar Maurice Glaize observed, &quot;On every side, in fantastic over-scale, the trunks of the silk-cotton trees soar skywards under a shadowy green canopy, their long spreading skirts trailing the ground and their endless roots coiling more like reptiles than plants.&quot;

==In popular media==
Ta Prohm was used as a location in the film &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; (2001). In the film, Lara Croft, played by Angelina Jolie, picked a jasmine flower and then fell through the earth into the temple, with the forthcoming scenes filmed at Pinewood Studios.

<text>Ta Keo (, ) is a temple-mountain in Angkor (Cambodia), possibly the first to be built entirely of sandstone by the Khmer Empire.

==The site==

Ta Keo was the state temple of Jayavarman V, son of Rajendravarman, who had built Pre Rup. Like Pre Rup, it has five sanctuary towers arranged in a quincunx, built on the uppermost level of five-tier pyramid consisting of overlapping terraces (a step pyramid), surrounded by moats, as a symbolic depiction of Mount Meru.

Its particularly massive appearance is due to the absence of external decorations, as carving had just begun when the work stopped, besides an elaborate use of perspective effects. It is considered an example of the so-called Khleang style.

The main axis of the temple is east-west and a 500 meters long causeway connects its eastern entrance to a landing stage on the East Baray, with which Ta Keo was in a tight relationship. The outer banks of the surrounding moats, now vanished, measured 255 m by 195 m.

The first terrace is 122 m by 106 m. Its wall of sandstone on laterite basis constitutes the outer enclosure. Along the east side there are two long galleries, whose roofs were made of wood and tiles. They were illuminated by balustrade windows.

The second terrace is 5.5 m higher. Each of the first two terraces has a gopura at the four cardinal points. Each gopura has three independent passages and a central tower with diminishing tiers.
A continuous gallery (1.4 m width) constitutes the inner enclosure of the second terrace. It has windows only towards the interior and measures 80 m by 75 m. It has no door and seems purely decorative. It is a first example of Khmer gallery (together with Phimeanakas). Before Ta Keo (e.g., in Pre Rup) there were long buildings that followed the length of enclosures with some discontinuity. However, it hasn&#x27;t got a stone vault; its roof was possibly made of wood and tiles.

Along the eastern side of the second terrace in the corners there are two buildings that are the shorter version of the long galleries of the first terrace. More towards the central axis there are two little sandstone &quot;libraries&quot;, opening to the west, with false windows on upper storeys.

The final pyramid rises 14 m in three narrow steps from the second terrace. Its base is 60 m square; the summit is 47 m square and stands 21.5 m above the ground. The four stairways that lead on the summit are continuous and very steep. At the foot of the eastern one there is a statue of a kneeling Nandi, which confirms that Ta Keo was a Shivaite temple. The absence of any decoration makes the final pyramid really massive. However, on the east face some damaged carvings of floral patterns are visible.

The four corner towers on the summit stand on 0.8 m high basements and open to the four cardinal points with protruding vestibules. In the central tower, which dominates the others from its basement 4 meters high, the vestibules are doubled. Fragments of lingas and several statues were found in the sanctuary chambers (some 4 meters wide) and around the towers. The central tower reaches a height of 45 meters.
==History==

Jayavarman V was ten years old when he succeeded his father, Rajendravarman, in 968. His early years of reign were turbulent and the court officials dominated the royal politics. When he was 17 (in 975), he began the construction of his own state temple, whose modern name is Ta Keo, that was dedicated some time around 1000. In contemporary inscriptions it is called &quot;Hemagiri&quot; or &quot;Hemasringagiri&quot; (&quot;the mountain with golden summits&quot;).

It remained unfinished until the reign of Suryavarman I. Yogisvarapandita, a high priest who became minister of Suryavarman I and &quot;received&quot; the temple from him many years later, says in inscriptions that a lightning strike hit the unfinished building, an evil omen, so the work stopped. Maybe work stopped simply because of the death of Jayavarman V, as there was a struggle for succession. The temple worked continuously as a cult center until the 13th century, and even Yogisvarapandita worshiped the shrines at the first levels of the temple.

A term tightly linked to Hemasringagiri is &quot;Jayendranagari&quot; (which in Sanskrit means &quot;capital of the victorious king&quot;), the royal palace or maybe the new capital city of Jayavarman V. However, the remains of this large hypothesized ensemble are very scarce. Today only a tower in the southwest survives, similar to the corner towers of Ta Keo, with an unusual single door to the south.

<text>The Baphuon () is a temple at Angkor, Cambodia. It is located in Angkor Thom, northwest of the Bayon. Also called &quot;golden mountain&quot; (svarnādrī), the Baphuon is built on an artificial hill. The temple was originally dedicated to Shiva and late converted to a Theravada Buddhist temple. The dating of the temple has been fractious; recent work has shown that it was not built during the reign of Udayādityavarman II, as is popularly reported. In 2015 a French team directly dates four iron crampons integrated into the structure using the AMS Carbon-14 method, revealed the construction was much earlier than thought and can now be considered as the major temple associated with Suryavarman I (1010–1050CE), a ruler which had no temple previously associated with his reign.

== History ==
Built in the mid-11th century, it is a three-tiered temple mountain built as the state temple of Suryavarman I dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. It is the archetype of the Baphuon style with intricate carvings covering every available surface. The temple adjoins the southern enclosure of the royal palace and measures 120 metres east-west by 100 metres north-south at its base and stands 34 meters tall without its tower, which would have made it roughly 50 meters tall. Its appearance apparently impressed Temür Khan&#x27;s late 13th century envoy Zhou Daguan during his visit from 1296 to 1297, who said it was &#x27;the Tower of Bronze...a truly astonishing spectacle, with more than ten chambers at its base.&#x27;

The Baphuon was later converted via Theravada Buddhist modifications that French scientists using AMS Carbon 14 have directly dated as a hundred years prior to the conventional 16th century estimation. This confirms that the adding of the reclining Buddha was related to the Ayutthayan occupation of Angkor circa 1430-1440CE, during a major period of political and religious instability.

A 9-meter tall by 70 meter long statue of a reclining Buddha was built on the west side&#x27;s second level, which probably required the demolition of the 8-meter tower above to supply stones for the statue, thus explaining its current absence. The temple was built on land filled with sand, and due to its immense size the site was unstable throughout its history. Large portions had probably already collapsed by the time the Buddha was added.

Surrounded by a wall 125 by 425 m the central tower was probably gilded wood, which has not survived.

By the 20th century, much of the temple had largely collapsed, and restoration efforts took on an epic quality. A large-scale project to dismantle the temple so that its core could be re-enforced before the whole is re-constructed again—a process known as anastylosis—was abandoned after civil war broke out in 1970. The workers and archaeologists were forced to leave 300,000 carefully labelled and numbered blocks organized across 10 hectares surrounding the temple. However, the plans identifying the pieces were lost during the decade of conflict and the Khmer Rouge that followed.

A second project to restore the temple was launched in 1996 under the guidance of architect Pascal Royère from the EFEO. It took the team another 16 years to complete what had become known as the &quot;largest 3D jigsaw puzzle in the world&quot;. In April 2011, after 51 years of work, the restoration was completed and the temple formally re-opened. King Norodom Sihamoni of Cambodia and Prime Minister François Fillon of France were among those who first toured the renovated temple during the inauguration ceremony on July 3, 2011.

<text>The Terrace of the Elephants () is part of the walled city of Angkor Thom, a ruined temple complex in Cambodia. 

== Description ==
The terrace was used by Angkor&#x27;s king Jayavarman VII as a platform from which to view his victorious returning army. It was attached to the palace of Phimeanakas (), of which only a few ruins remain. Most of the original structure was made of organic material and has long since disappeared. Most of what remains are the foundation platforms of the complex. The terrace is named for the carvings of elephants on its eastern face.

The 350 meter-long Terrace of Elephants was used as a giant reviewing stand for public ceremonies and served as a base for the king&#x27;s grand audience hall. It has five outworks extending towards the Central Square-three in the centre and one at each end. The middle section of the retaining wall is decorated with life size garuda and lions; towards either end are the two parts of the famous parade of elephants complete with their Khmer mahouts.

<text>Preah Ko (, &quot;The Sacred Bull&quot;) was the first temple to be built in the ancient and now defunct city of Hariharalaya (in the area that today is called Roluos), some 15 kilometers south-east of the main group of temples at Angkor, Cambodia. The temple was built under the Khmer King Indravarman I in 879 to honor members of the king&#x27;s family, whom it places in relation with the Hindu deity Shiva.

==Etymology==
Preah Ko (Sacred Bull) derives its name from the three statues of sandstone located in the front of and facing the temple&#x27;s central towers. These statues represent Nandi, the white bull who serves as the mount of Shiva.

==History==

After the Khmer king Jayavarman II founded the Khmer empire in 802 A.D., he finally established his capital at Hariharalaya, where he died. Indravarman I was the nephew of Jayavarman II. When he ascended to the throne, he ordered the construction first of Preah Ko, which was dedicated in 879, and later of the temple-mountain known as the Bakong. It is likely that this building program was made possible by the king&#x27;s peaceful reign and his ability to draw income from the expanding empire. A restoration of the towers took place in early 1990s, financed by German government.
==Site==
Preah Ko consists of six brick towers arranged in two rows of three towers each perched on a sandstone platform. The towers face east, and the front central tower is the tallest. The sanctuaries are dedicated to three divinized forefathers of Indravarman and their respective wives. The front central tower is dedicated to Jayavarman II, the founder of the Khmer empire. The tower to the left is dedicated to Prithivindreshvara, King Indravarman&#x27;s father; the tower to the right to Rudreshvara, his grandfather. The three rear towers are dedicated to the wives of these three men. The central towers all bear images of the Hindu god Shiva.

<text>Bakong ( ) is the first Khmer temple mountain of sandstone constructed by rulers of the Khmer Empire at Angkor near modern Siem Reap in Cambodia. In the final decades of the 9th century AD, it served as the official state temple of King Indravarman I in the ancient city of Hariharalaya, located in an area that today is called Roluos.

The structure of Bakong took shape of stepped pyramid, popularly identified as temple mountain of early Khmer temple architecture. The striking similarity of the Bakong and Borobudur temple in Java, going into architectural details such as the gateways and stairs to the upper terraces, suggests strongly that Borobudur was served as the prototype of Bakong. Contact is inferred to have occurred between the Khmer kingdom and the Sailendra dynasty in Java, who would have transmitted to Cambodia not only ideas, but also technical and architectural details of Borobudur, including arched gateways in corbelling method.

==History==
In 802 AD, the first king of Angkor Jayavarman II declared the sovereignty of Cambodia. After ups and downs, he established his capital at Hariharalaya. A few decades later, his successors constructed Bakong in stages as the first temple mountain of sandstone at Angkor. The inscription on its stele (classified K.826) says that in 881 King Indravarman I dedicated the temple to the god Shiva and consecrated its central religious image, a lingam whose name &quot;Sri Indresvara&quot; was a combination of the king&#x27;s own and the suffix &quot;-esvara&quot; which stood for Shiva (&quot;Iśvara&quot;). According to George Coedès, the devarāja cult consisted in the idea of divine kingship as a legitimacy of royal power, but later authors stated that it doesn&#x27;t necessarily involve the cult of physical persona of the ruler himself.

Bakong enjoyed its status as the state temple of Angkor for only a few years, but later additions from the 12th or 13th century testify that it was not abandoned. Toward the end of the 9th century, Indravarman&#x27;s son and successor Yasovarman I moved the capital from Hariharalaya to the area north of Siem Reap now known as Angkor, where he founded the new city of Yaśodharapura around a new temple mountain called Bakheng.

The site of Bakong measures 900 metres by 700 metres, and consists of three concentric enclosures separated by two moats, the main axis going from east to west. The outer enclosure has neither a wall nor gopuram and its boundary is the outer moat, which is only partially visible today. The current access road from NH6 leads at the edge of the second enclosure. The inner moat delimits a 400 by 300 metres area, with remains of a laterite wall and four cruciform gopuram, and it is crossed by a wide earthen causeway, flanked by seven-headed nāgas, such as a draft of nāga bridge . Between the two moats there are the remains of 22 satellite temples of brick. The innermost enclosure, bounded by a laterite wall, measures 160 metres by 120 metres and contains the central temple pyramid and eight brick temple towers, two on each side. A number of other smaller buildings are also located within the enclosure. Just outside the eastern gopura there is a modern buddhist temple.

The pyramid itself has five levels and its base is 65 by 67 metres. It was reconstructed by Maurice Glaize at the end of the 1930s according to methods of anastylosis. On the top there is a single tower that is much later in provenance, and the architectural style of which is not that of the 9th century foundations of Hariharalaya, but that of the 12th-century temple city Angkor Wat.

Though the pyramid at one time must have been covered with bas relief carvings in stucco, today only fragments remain. A dramatic scene-fragment involving what appear to be asuras in battle gives a sense of the likely high quality of the carvings. Large stone statues of elephants are positioned as guardians at the corners of the three lower levels of the pyramid. Statues of lions guard the stairways.

<text>Prasat Kravan () is a small 10th-century temple consisting of five reddish brick towers on a common terrace, at Angkor, Cambodia, south of the artificial lake (baray) called Srah Srang. Its original Sanskrit name is unknown. The modern name in Khmer, &quot;Prasat Kravan&quot;, means &quot;artabotrys odoratissimus&quot; temple. The temple was dedicated to Vishnu in 921 CE, according to an inscription on doorjambs.

The site was cleaned from vegetation in the 1930s by Henri Marchal and Georges Trouvé. Afterwards the towers were restored on Bernard Philippe Groslier&#x27;s initiative from 1962 to 1966, adding some new bricks which are marked with a &quot;CA&quot; (meaning &quot;Conservation Angkor&quot;).

The temple is oriented to the east and surrounded by a small moat. Its exterior is striking for its classical lines and symmetry. The central and the south tower have superstructures which take advantage of false perspective by simple means of diminishing tiers. The sanctuary&#x27;s interiors are remarkable for the large bas-relief depictions of Vishnu and Lakshmi that have been carved into the walls of reddish brick, connected by a vegetable compound. This type of sculptured artwork is rather common in Cham temples, but rare in known Khmer monuments.

==Bas-reliefs==
The bas-reliefs on the interior walls of the central tower are representations of Vishnu. There are three in all:
* Four-armed Vishnu sits astride his vehicle Garuda and holding his standard appurtenances: the globe, the conch, the discus, and the baton.
* Four-armed Vishnu, again holding his four standard appurtenances, takes a large step. This image illustrates the story of Vishnu in his incarnation as Vamana the dwarf taking three great steps to reclaim the world from the asura Bali.
* Eight-armed Vishnu stands stiffly in the position of a statue. He is surrounded by hundreds of tiny devotees and surmounted by a crocodile or a lizard. Its significance remains unknown.

The interior walls of the northernmost tower feature a pair of bas-reliefs of Lakshmi, Vishnu&#x27;s consort, flanked by devotees:
* In one of the depictions, the goddess holds the trident of Shiva and the discus of Vishnu, possibly marking her as the great goddess who transcends the duality of Saiva and Vaishnava worship.
* A more traditional depiction of Lakshmi holding lotuses is on the opposite wall.

<text>Banteay Kdei (; &quot;Prasat Banteay Kdei&quot;, ), also known as &quot;Citadel of Monks&#x27; cells&quot;, is a Buddhist temple in Angkor, Cambodia. It is located southeast of Ta Prohm and east of Angkor Thom. Built in the mid-12th to early 13th centuries AD during the reign of Jayavarman VII (who was posthumously given the title &quot;Maha paramasangata pada&quot;), it is in the Bayon architectural style, similar in plan to Ta Prohm and Preah Khan, but less complex and smaller. Its structures are contained within two successive enclosure walls, and consist of two concentric galleries from which emerge towers, preceded to the east by a cloister.

This Buddhist monastic complex is currently dilapidated due to faulty construction and poor quality of sandstone used in its buildings, and is now undergoing renovation. Banteay Kdei had been occupied by monks at various intervals over the centuries until the 1960s.

==Geography==
The Banteay Kdei, one of the many Angkor temples, is located in the Angkor Archaeological Park of area. The ancient city of Angkor during the Khmer Empire extended from Tonle Sap to the Kulen hills covering a vast area of . The temple is approached from the east gopura of Ta Prohm along a path. This path leads to the west gate entrance gopura of Banteay Kdei. It is east of Angkor Thom.

==History of Banteay Kdei==
The name Banteay Kdei originates from an earlier name, Kuti, which is mentioned in the Sdok Kak Thom. This stele describes the arrival of Jayavarman II to the area, &quot;When they arrived at the eastern district, the king bestowed an estate and a village called Kuti upon the family of the royal chaplain.&quot; This royal chaplain was the Brahman scholar Sivakaivalya, his chief priest for the Devaraja cult.

The Khmer Empire lasted from 802 to 1431, initially under Hindu religious beliefs up to the end of the 12th century and later under Buddhist religious practices. It was a time when temples of grandeur came to be built and reached a crescendo during the reign of Suryavarman II until 1145/1150, and later in the 12th–13th centuries, under Jayavarman VII. Many Buddhist temples were built, including the Banteay Kdei, from middle of the 12th century to early 13th century. Though Jayavarman VII was credited with building many temples, he was also accused of squandering money on extravagant temple building projects at the expense of society and other duties. He built Buddhist temples in which Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara was the main deity. This temple built, conforming to the style of the Ta Prohm and Preah Khan temples in the vicinity during the same period by Jayavarman VII, but of a smaller size, was built as a Buddhist monastic complex on the site of a 10th-century temple built by Rajendravarman. Some small inscriptions attest to the building of this temple by Jayavarman VII and the royal architect, Kavindrarimathana.

Jayavarman VII had come to power at the age of 55 after defeating Chams who had invaded Angkor and subjected it to devastation. His &quot;prodigious activity&quot; resulted in the restoration of Cambodia from its ruins. He was chiefly the architect of the rebuilt capital at Angkor Thom and was called a &quot;Great Builder&quot;. He was responsible for building many temples, which apart from Banteay Kdei, included the central temple of the Bayon, Prah Khan, Ta Prohm and many others, and also many rest houses for pilgrims. The reasons for building this temple at its present site is not known. However, it is established that the temple is a contemporary of the Angkor Wat as many similarities have been identified between the two, and also with Phimai temple in Thailand. It is reported to be the first temple built by Jayavarman VII in 1181 AD, opposite to the Srah Srang reservoir.

In the 13th century, most of the temples built by Jayavarman were vandalised. However, some of the Mahayana Buddhist frontons and lintels are still seen in good condition. It is also the view of some archaeologists that the temple was built by Jayavarman II in honour of his religious teacher.

The temple, which for several centuries after the Khmer reign ended, remained neglected and covered with vegetation. It was exposed after clearing the surrounding overgrowth of vegetation in 1920–1922. This work was carried out under the guidance of Henri Marchal (then Conservator of Angkor) and Ch. Battuer, by adopting a conservation principle which was known as &quot;the principle of anastylosis, which was being employed very effectively by the Dutch authorities in Indonesia&quot;. It was partially occupied by Buddhist monks till the 1960s.

For ten years till March 2002, Sophia University Mission or the Sophia Mission of Japan carried out several Archaeological research at the Banteay Kdei temple. During these investigations, a cache of fragments of 274 Buddhist statues made in sandstone, along with a few metal art pieces, were unearthed, in 2001. Plans to build a storage room to house the statues was also planned.

==Layout==
The sacred temple complex is cloistered and packed in a space of with three enclosures within a large compound wall of size , made of laterite stones. The entry is from the east facing gopura, which is in a cruciform embellished with Lokesvara images. The temple is a treasure house of sculptures in the architectural styles of the Bayon and also of the Angkor Wat. The complex is on a single level.

;External enclosure
The external enclosure with four concentric walls, has four gopuras similar to the Ta Prohm temple, and all are in some degree of preserved status. At the four corners, the gopuras have a fascia of Lokesvara (Buddhist deity, Avalokitesvara) mounted over Garuda images (it is also mentioned that the smiling faces are of King Jayavarman II, similar to those seen in the Beyan temple). The east facing gopura, in particular, has well-preserved garuda images on its corners. Two hundred meters from the west entrance of this enclosure leads to a moat, which is decorated with statues of lions and naga-balustrades mounted on garudas. The moat itself has in its precincts the third enclosure which measures , also enclosed with laterite walls. The Buddha image at the entrance to the moat, near the second interior gate, is well preserved, considering the fact that most of the other statues have been destroyed or stolen.

;Third enclosure
The third enclosure has a gopura which has a cruciform plan. It has pillars which are crossed by vaults. There are three passages in this enclosure, two on either side are independent, with laterite walls. The niches here have small figurines, and large apsara devatas in single poses or in pairs of dancing poses. Large Buddha images, in an internal courtyard of this enclosure, have been defaced by vandals. A paved access from here leads to the main shrine, which comprises two galleried enclosures. At the entrance to these enclosures, from the eastern end, is the &quot;Hall of Dancers&quot;, which has four open courtyards and the pillars have fine carvings of apsaras.

;Second enclosure
The second enclosure, which is part of the main temple, measures . It has a gopura on its eastern side and also subsidiary gopura on the west. Entrance doors are at the northern and southern ends. The gopura is built like a gallery with one exterior wall and double row of pillars which open into a courtyard and which has mostly shored up walls with small openings at the bottom to allow air circulation. The niches here are decorated with images of apsaras, and a Buddha statue in the central hall has been defaced by vandals. Bayon style architectural features built-in are the &quot;balustered false windows with lowered blinds and devatas with headdresses in the form of small flaming discs set in a triangle.&quot; The vaults built in sandstone and laterite have collapsed at several locations of the gallery. The inner enclosures contain library building to its north and south and also a central sanctuary.

;Inner enclosure
The inner enclosure of the main temple is built on a layout plan. This enclosure has four corner towers abutted by small gopuras. Galleries running along an axis link these towers to the main sanctuary. The towers at the north-east and south-east are linked with the second gallery where a Buddha statue in a sitting posture is seen, in the backdrop of an open sky line. The sanctum which is square enclosure has some traces of statues of deities. This entire enclosure, however, is not built in Bayon style and hence conjectured to be of an earlier period. Remnants of wooden ceiling are also seen here. The entrance to the sanctum is flanked by dvarapalas surrounded by apsaras.

;Srah Srang
Srah Srang or &quot;The royal bathing pool&quot; or &quot;pool of ablutions&quot; to the east of Banteay Kdei, which was dug to dimensions of x during the reign of Rajendraverman in the 10th century, was beautified by Jayavarman VII with well laid out steps of laterite stones with external margin of sandstone, on the banks of the pond facing the Sun. It is set amidst large trees and has turquoise blue waters all the year round. The approaching steps to the water edge are flanked by two stone statues of lions with ornamented Nāga-balustrades. The pond was reserved for use by the king and his wives. A stone base seen at an island in the centre of the pond once housed a wooden temple where the king did meditation. At the lily filled lake, watching sunset reflections in the lake is quite an experience. The water from the lake is now used for rice cultivation by farmers of the area.

==Architectural features==

Some specific architectural features which evolved with the Bayon style are clearly discerned in this temple. The roof is supported on free-standing pillars in the eastern and western pavilions in the third enclosure, built in a cruciform plan with the inner row of pillars supporting the roof. The pillars are also tied to the wall by a tie beam using a &quot;mortise–and–tenon join&quot; patterned on wooden structures. Other features noted are of the four central pillars in the western pavilion which have been strengthened with temporary supports of laterite stone block pillars. Carvings of Buddha are seen on all these pillars but mostly defaced. The temporary support system provided to the roof built on free standing pillars is indicative of problems of design seen in the temples built during this period.
==Restoration==
Laser scans and imaging of the Banteay Kdei and Angkor Wat Western Causeway were performed within a project launched in March 2004 by the University of California and Sophia University of Tokyo, in partnership with the nonprofit CyArk. The obtained information has facilitated restoration and reconstruction of these structures, which is funded by the Sophia University, and much publicly accessible data from the project is hosted on the CyArk Website. The APSARA Authority has achieved significant improvements in conservation and preservation of monuments in Angkor. Some of the towers and corridors are under restoration and as a result some locations have been cordoned off. Strengthening measures are seen in some parts of the interior temple area where structures in danger are tied together with cables.

<text>Wolfram Kurt Erhard Hirth (28 February 1900 – 25 July 1959) was a German gliding pioneer and sailplane designer. He was a co-founder of Schempp-Hirth, still a renowned glider manufacturer.

Hirth was born in Stuttgart, the son of an engineer and tool-maker. He was the younger brother of Hellmuth, who founded the famous Hirth aircraft engine manufacturing company.

==Early years==
As a young man, Hirth took up gliding and was soon drawn to the Wasserkuppe, then the focus of the German gliding movement, earning his pilot&#x27;s licence in 1920. In 1924, Hirth lost a leg after a motorcycle accident. From then on, he would fly while wearing a wooden prosthesis. He had the fibula from his amputated leg fashioned into a cigarette holder

In 1928, he graduated from the Technical University of Stuttgart with a diploma in engineering and began to focus on aircraft construction. Over the next decade, he would also tour the world, promoting gliding throughout Europe, the United States, Japan, South America, and South Africa. On 10 March 1931 he gave a demonstration of glider aerobatics over New York City. On one of these publicity trips, he suffered major injuries in a crash in Hungary, requiring a hospital stay of four months. He and Robert Kronfeld were the first pilots to gain the Silver C badge. He was the chief flying instructor at the Grünau Gliding School in the Giant Mountains, then in Germany. In 1933, he became the Head of the new Gliding School in Hornberg.

Later in the year, he became the first to correctly identify the phenomenon of wave lift, the highest form of lift source available to soaring pilots.

In Jan. 1934, he joined Professor Georgii&#x27;s South America expedition, along with Peter Riedel, Hanna Reitsch, and Heini Dittmar, to study thermal conditions, with his sailplane &quot;Moatzagotl&quot;. While in Argentina, Wolf set a record of seventy-six successive loops.

Wolf Hirth also took part in International Championships of Touring Aircraft Challenge 1929, Challenge 1932 (6th place) and Challenge 1934 (13th place). After some time in the USA he returned to Germany in 1934 because of US economic depression.

==Glider company==
With the assistance of Wolf Hirth, Martin Schempp founded his own company in Göppingen in 1935: &quot;Sportflugzeugbau Göppingen Martin Schempp&quot;. In 1938, Wolf Hirth, mainly responsible for the design work, officially became a partner in the company, which then took on the new name &quot;Sportflugzeugbau Schempp-Hirth&quot;. The company relocated to Kirchheim-Teck the same year. The company first manufactured a small training glider, the Göppingen Gö 1, intended to rival the Grunau Baby. The company&#x27;s first real success, however, was the Gö 3 Minimoa, a distinctive aircraft with an elegant gull wing design that was used to break several world records and win championships around the world.

Hirth continued to direct the firm throughout World War II. In 1940 the company began manufacturing assembly parts for Messerschmitt Me 323 and Messerschmitt Bf 109 and other aircraft. From 1945 the company made furniture and other wooden components for industry until glider production could begin again in 1951. He was elected President of the German Aero-Club in 1956.

==Death==
Hirth had a heart attack while flying his Vogt Lo-100 aerobatic glider in 1959 and died in the subsequent crash. &quot;Handbuch des Segelfliegens&quot; was published posthumously in 1963.

==Honours==

In many municipalities of Baden-Württemberg roads were named after Wolf Hirth. In Bartholomä, Bettringen, Böblingen, Ditzingen, Esslingen-am-Neckar, Leinzell, Leonberg, Kirchheim/Teck and Schramberg there is a Wolf-Hirth-Straße. Outside of Baden-Württemberg, there is a Wolf-Hirth-Straße in Gersfeld (Rhön), and a Hirthstraße in Kiel-Holtenau.

<doc id="450210" wikidata="Q463945" url="?curid=450210" title="Teresa Teng">
<text>Teng Li-Chun (; 29 January 1953 – 8 May 1995), commonly known as Teresa Teng, was a Taiwanese singer, actress, musician and philanthropist. Referred to by some as the &quot;Eternal Queen of Asian Pop&quot;, she is considered to be one of the most successful and influential Asian artists of all time. Teng is recognized as a cultural icon for her contributions to Chinese pop, giving birth to the phrase, &quot;Wherever there are Chinese-speaking people, there is the music of Teresa Teng.&quot; A polyglot, Teng&#x27;s voice and emotionally resonant songs have transcended geographical, linguistic, and political boundaries, captivating audiences across Asia for several decades. 

With a career spanning almost 30 years, Teng established herself as a dominant and influential force in Asia throughout most of her career, including East Asia, Southeast Asia, and, to some extent, South Asia. Teng is credited as the Far East&#x27;s first pop superstar and by some as the pioneer of modern Chinese pop music — a major force in the development of the Chinese music industry by incorporating western and eastern styles into her music, replacing the most revolutionary songs then prevalent in mainland China and laying the foundation for modern Chinese popular music. 

Teng recorded more than 1,700 songs throughout her career, in her native language, Mandarin, but also Hokkien, Cantonese, Shanghainese, Japanese, Indonesian, English, and Italian. Teng is considered instrumental in bridging the cultural gap across Chinese-speaking regions. She was one of the first artists to connect Japan to some of East and Southeast Asia by singing Japanese pop songs, according to Nippon. In Taiwan, she rose to fame for entertaining the armed forces and singing patriotic songs that appealed to the people of the island. Teng was nicknamed &quot;the patriotic entertainer&quot; and &quot;the soldiers&#x27; sweetheart&quot;. To date, Teng&#x27;s songs have been covered by hundreds of artists worldwide.

According to IFPI&#x27;s statistics, Teng has sold over 48 million albums, excluding sales in mainland China. In 1986, she was named by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the seven greatest female singers in the world. In 2009, in an online poll by a Chinese government web portal to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Teng was selected as the &quot;most influential cultural figure in China since 1949&quot; by 8.5 million netizens. On the eve of International Women&#x27;s Day in 2010, she was named &quot;the most influential woman in modern China&quot; in a poll conducted by many well-known Chinese media from 1 March to 8 March. In 2022, a street was named after Teng in Ivry-sur-Seine, Grand Paris, from the Municipal council of France. On 21 September 2024, an Indo-Pacific Strategic Think Tank (IPST) conducted a poll in Japan, &quot;Who is the most famous person in Taiwan?&quot; Teng won the poll with 53.8% of total votes. She was inducted into the &quot;Popular Music Hall of Fame&quot; at the Koga Masao music Museum in Japan in 2007, making Teng the only non-Japanese person to be inducted. 

==Early life==
Teng was born Teng Li-yun to &quot;waishengren&quot; parents in Baozhong, Yunlin County in Taiwan on 29 January 1953. Her father was a soldier in the Republic of China Armed Forces from Daming, Hebei, and her mother was from Dongping County, Shandong, who fled to Taiwan after communists took over mainland China in 1949.

The only daughter among five children, Teng was raised in a poverty-stricken Kuomintang family and spent her early childhood in military dependents&#x27; villages, first in Yunlin and then in Pingtung. Teng&#x27;s father retired in 1957 and then worked selling cakes to make ends meet. Teng received her early education at in Luzhou, Taipei County, Taiwan.

Teng was exposed to music at an early age through her music-loving parents. Her father was a Peking opera enthusiast, and her mother appreciated Huangmei opera, often accompanying Teng to Chinese movie theatres and opera houses. At the age of six, Teng began voice lessons through an acquaintance of her father, who instructed an Air Force band. Considering the environment of 1950s Taiwan under martial law, Teng&#x27;s first mentor introduced her to singing before military audiences, a practice Teng continued throughout her life. 

Teng earned her first major prize in 1964, when she sang &quot;Visiting Yingtai&quot; from Shaw Brothers&#x27; Huangmei opera movie, &quot;The Love Eterne&quot;, at an event hosted by the Broadcasting Corporation of China. The following year, Teng went to attend in Sanchong, Taipei County, to further her studies. However, due to a conflict between her performance and studies, forced by family economic factors, Teng dropped out of school in the second year and pursued her career as a singer professionally. Teng was soon able to support her family with her singing.

== Career ==

=== Early beginnings and rise to fame ===

Teng&#x27;s career commenced in 1967 as a host of the television show &quot;One Star a Day,&quot; which aired for 20 minutes from Tuesday to Sunday. She then appeared in television dramas and movies, including a leading role in the 1967 film &quot;Thank You, Manager&quot;. At the age of 14, Teng withdrew from school to focus on music. She signed with a local company, &quot;Yeu Jow Records&quot;, and began to release a series of long-playing albums of &quot;a go-go&quot; dance tunes and cover versions of Western pop songs as well as local Taiwanese, Chinese, and Southeast Asian folk tunes. However, due to the lack of extra copyright royalties to increase her income, Teng committed to singing in nightclubs around Taiwan. She debuted at Paris Night, an upscale Taipei nightclub, and set a record for performing onstage there for 70 consecutive days, giving a 90-minute performance every single day. 

Teng&#x27;s albums sold well, and she eventually got an opportunity to record a theme song for &quot;Jingjing&quot;, Taiwan&#x27;s first televised series, and did a promotional tour that attracted attention in the media. Teng&#x27;s first taste of fame came in 1968 when performance on the popular Taiwanese music program &quot;The Gathering of Stars&quot; led to a record contract. She released several albums within the next few years under the Life Records label in Hong Kong. During these years, Teng recorded several top hits, such as &quot;Remembering Mama&quot; and &quot;The Moment I See You, I Smile&quot;. She held concerts in Southeast Asia, drawing big crowds throughout the region. Teng&#x27;s earnings from performing and recording eventually afforded her family a comfortable life; they moved from Luzhou District to Beitou District, Taipei, where they bought a home.

By the 1970s, Teng&#x27;s music style had changed; she fused pop and opera styles and incorporated Western jazz in order to further expand her market. Teng&#x27;s popularity boomed in Asia after she released several albums in multiple languages. In April 1979, Teng held her first concert in Vancouver, Canada. On her next trip, Teng toured major US cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles. In 1980, she was invited to perform at Lincoln Center in New York and the Los Angeles Music Center in California, becoming the first singer of Chinese descent to make a headline there. Upon her return to Taiwan, Teng went on a Southeast Asian tour in 1981, drawing 35,000 attendees in Malaysia. She continued to hold large-scale concerts in Hong Kong and the Southeast Asian region almost every year. In 1983, Teng performed a series of concerts at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. They met with tremendous success. Teng gave many free concerts throughout most of her career to help the less fortunate or raise funds for charities. The funds collected from her concerts were donated to public welfare.

=== Musical move in China ===
For most of the previous three decades, China was both economically and culturally closed to the rest of the world. Around 1974, Teng&#x27;s songs began to trickle into China with the availability of radios. In 1977, her song &quot;The Moon Represents My Heart&quot; became one of the earliest foreign songs to arrive in the mainland. In 1978, with economic reform and the opening of borders, cassette recorders and pirated recordings of Teng&#x27;s songs began to flow from coastal cities to the rest of the country. Her popularity soon skyrocketed. In Taiwan, Teng&#x27;s songs became a propaganda tool for the KMT&#x27;s psychological war against the Chinese Communist Party. Her songs were blasted from the sea-facing speakers from Kinmen Island to the residents of mainland China at a much higher volume. This propaganda practice continued throughout the 1980s. 

In the early 1980s, continuing political tension between mainland China and Taiwan led to her music, along with that of other singers from Taiwan and Hong Kong, being banned for some years in mainland China, describing it as too &quot;bourgeois&quot; and &quot;corrupt&quot; by Chinese authorities. In spite of the ban, Teng&#x27;s songs defied the censorship and penetrated China&#x27;s iron curtain. Her popularity continued in China through cassettes sold on Black market, with fans paying up to a month&#x27;s rent for pirated cassettes of her songs. Teng&#x27;s songs continued to be played everywhere, from nightclubs to government buildings, and the ban was soon lifted. Teng became almost as well known in mainland China as the country&#x27;s leader. Her fans nicknamed her &quot;Little Deng&quot; because she had the same family name as Deng Xiaoping; there was a saying that, by day, everyone listened to &quot;old Deng&quot; because they had to. At night, everyone listened to &quot;Little Teng&quot; because they wanted to. Shanghai Party newspaper &quot;Wenhui Bao&quot; expressed fears that Teng&#x27;s songs may erode the revolutionary spirit of the (Communist) Chinese. Faced with this solid wall of popularity, mainland China ceased its restrictions on her music from the mid-1980s onward.

=== Light Exquisite Feeling and political outlook ===
Teng&#x27;s contract with Polydor ended in 1981, and she signed a contract with Taurus Records in 1983 and made a successful comeback appearance in Japan. That same year, Teng released her most critically acclaimed album, &quot;Dandan youqing&quot;, translated as &quot;Light Exquisite Feeling,&quot; which sets 12 poems from the Tang and Song dynasties into music, blending modern and traditional styles. It became her first album to include entirely new songs, without any covers. The most popular single from the album is &quot;Wishing We Last Forever&quot;. Teng apparently felt a deep attachment to the mainland, as she immersed herself in the classics of the Tang and Song periods. In a television special, Teng spoke of her desire to contribute to the transmission of &quot;Chinese&quot; culture. Dressed in her period clothing, she commented:I have one small desire. I hope everyone will like these songs, and will learn these songs so that the flourishing begonias within its [China’s] ten million square kilometers and the treasures of this 5000-year-old culture can be handed down from generation to generation through song. And through song, I hope our posterity will never forget the happiness, sadness, and glory of being a “Chinese” person.

The album achieved widespread commercial success, selling over 5 million copies throughout Asia, making it the best-selling Chinese music album as of August 2008. It received a positive response from both the public and critics, commending Teng&#x27;s outstanding interpretation of the ancient poems and successfully projecting classical Chinese literature into a contemporary popular music style. It was well accepted in Southeast Asia and went gold on the first day of its release in Hong Kong. Yang Yanxing, a professor at Tianjin Conservatory of Music, greatly praised the album, describing it as &quot;the finest work of the Chinese music circle&quot;. In March 2012, Pu Xiqian from the &quot;China News Service&quot; called the album a &quot;perfect combination of poems and music&quot;. Later, Teng started working on completing a sequel to the album. However, due to changes in the surroundings of music, as well as her deteriorating health and other reasons, she failed to realize her wish.

In 1987, Teng released the Mandarin version of the album &quot;I Only Care About You.&quot; After that, owing to her health issues, she basically stopped participating in commercial activities and gradually entered a semi-retired state. Teng performed in Paris during the 1989 Tiananmen student protests on behalf of the students and expressed her support. On 27 May 1989, over 300,000 people attended the Concert for Democracy in China () at the Happy Valley Racecourse in Hong Kong. One of the highlights was her rendition of &quot;My Home Is on the Other Side of the Mountain&quot;.

Though Teng performed in many countries around the world, she never performed in mainland China. During her 1980 TTV concert, when asked about such a possibility, Teng responded by stating that the day she performs on the mainland will be the day the Three Principles of the People are implemented there—in reference to either the pursuit of Chinese democracy or reunification under the banner of the ROC.

=== Career in Hong Kong ===
In 1975, Teng collaborated with Polydor Records of Hong Kong. Her album &quot;Island Love Songs: Goodbye My Love (1975)&quot; won her the Ten-Star Prize and the opportunity to star in a movie musical of her own. The album was awarded platinum at Hong Kong&#x27;s first Golden Album Awards. In 1976, Teng held her first Hong Kong concert at Lee Theatre, which was a tremendous success. Teng continued performing in concerts for the next five years, attracting big crowds throughout this time. Two years later, Teng&#x27;s albums &quot;Teresa Teng&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Love Songs of the Island 3&quot; won her second Golden Album Award. Teng released her first Cantonese album, &quot;Irreconcilable&quot; (勢不兩立) in 1980, which became the best-seller of the year; its single, &quot;Forget Him&quot;, became one of the most famous Cantonese pop songs at that time. The album received platinum at the Golden Album Awards. 

In 1982, her dual album of &quot;Teresa Teng&#x27;s Concert Live&quot; became another platinum after hitting the market. Teng became a household name in Hong Kong and held a concert at Queen Elizabeth Stadium the same year. Her second album, &quot;Strolling Down the Road of Life&quot; (漫步人生路), released in 1983, achieved even greater success than her predecessor. It became her fifth consecutive album to be awarded platinum, a record-breaking win among all singers in Hong Kong. Teng&#x27;s popularity reached its peak by the end of 1983 with six straight sold-out concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum. These concerts broke all sorts of Hong Kong records and played to a combined total audience of about 100,000 people. The concert, named A Billion Applause Concert, was performed in both Taiwan and Hong Kong from 29 December 1983 to 3 January 1984, in honor of her 15th year as a performer. A year later, Teng was awarded a special medal by PolyGram Hong Kong as a tribute to her success for having sold more than five million copies in Hong Kong.

=== Career in Japan ===

Teng entered the Japanese market in 1973. On March 1, 1974, she released her debut Japanese single, &quot;No Matter Tonight or Tomorrow&quot;, marking the start of her career in Japan. Initially, the single received a lukewarm response, peaking at 75th on the Oricon Chart with sales of approximately 30,000. The Watanabe firm considered giving up using Teng&#x27;s name. However, considering her success in Asia, the record company decided to release two or three consecutive singles to test the market further. On 1 July 1974, Teng&#x27;s second single &quot;Airport&quot; was released. The sales of &#x27;Airport&#x27; were huge, totaling 700,000 copies. She then released a number of successful singles including &quot;The Night Ferry&quot; and &quot;Goodbye, My Love&quot;. In 1979, Teng was caught with a fake Indonesian passport while entering Japan and was deported and banned from entering the country for one year.

After a long absence, Teng returned to the Japanese market on 21 September 1983 and released her first single &quot;Tsugunai&quot; (Atonement) after her comeback on 21 January 1984. The single did not receive good response initially; however, after a month, sales started to pick up, and seven months later, &quot;Tsugunai&quot; eventually ranked eighth on the Oricon Chart and first on Japan Cable Broadcasting Chart. By the end of the year, sales surpassed 700,000 copies and final sales reached a million copies. Teng won the top award of &#x27;Singer of the year&#x27; from Japan Cable Award. &quot;Tsugunai&quot; won the most popular song category and stayed on the Oricon Chart for nearly a year. The success broke all the sales records of her previous period (1974–79). On 21 February 1985, Teng&#x27;s next single, &quot;Aijin&quot; (Lover) topped the Oricon Chart and Japan cable broadcasting request chart in the first week of its release. The song remained #1 for 14 consecutive weeks and sales broke the 1.5 million mark. With &quot;Aijin&quot;, Teng won the &#x27;Singer of the Year&#x27; for the second time. Moreover, she was invited to perform in &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot;, which represented a high honor that is restricted to the top performers of the year in the Japanese music world. 

Teng&#x27;s next single &quot;Toki no Nagare ni Mi o Makase&quot; was released on 21 February 1986. The single topped both the Oricon and Japan Cable Broadcasting Chart and sales of the single reached 2.5 million in the Asian market becoming one of the most popular singles in Japan that year. Teng won the &quot;Japan Cable Award&quot; for the third time in a row. She was invited to perform in &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot; for the second time. Teng became the first-ever artist to achieve three consecutive wins of this &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, also known as &quot;Japan Cable Award&quot;. She also remains the only foreign singer to win this award for three consecutive years in the history of Japanese music (1984–86). Teng gave her last solo concert at the NHK Hall in Tokyo in 1985 before semi-retiring from the entertainment circle.

=== As a military singer in Taiwan ===
One of Taiwan&#x27;s most famous cultural exports, Teng was born to a military family, her father served as a member of the Republic of China Armed Forces during World War II. After the regime collapsed on the mainland, the Nationalist government switched to Taiwan as their base after 1949. As a child, Teng grew up in this martial environment of the 1950s. Her first mentor introduced her to singing before military audiences, a practice she continued throughout her life. In those years, Teng gave many performances for soldiers and sang patriotic songs on television programs. In February 1979, while attempting to enter Japan, Teng was caught using a fake Indonesian passport she bought on the black market. The incident was criticised both in Taiwan and Japan. She was barred for one year from entering the country by Japan&#x27;s Minister of Justice. 

In 1980, a year after the incident, she was allowed to return to Taiwan on condition of cooperation with the Taiwanese government. Teng performed for the Taiwanese troops again, and the income from her performances was donated to the &quot;Funds for Self-Improvement and Patriotism&quot;. In August 1981, Teng performed for the troops for one month, touring military sites all over Taiwan. She visited the generals of the army, navy, and air force and sang for them. These performances were broadcast on TTV&#x27;s special program named &quot;Teresa Teng on the Frontline&quot;. Due to her vigorous devotion to soldiers in Taiwan, Teng was awarded the &quot;Patriotic Entertainer&quot; medal by the government information office. These frequent performances for the troops garnered her the nickname &quot;the soldiers&#x27; sweetheart&quot; by the media. In 1988, the death of President Chiang Ching-kuo marked the end of martial rule in Taiwan. In the early 1990s, Teng returned to entertain the troops again, with her last performance being in 1994.

== Philanthropic causes ==
Teng began charity performances at a very young age. One of her first performances came on 17 August 1968, when she sang at the charity fair in Zhongshan Hall in Taipei, for the relief of the earthquake in the Philippines. The charity sale was donated on the spot. The following year, Teng was invited by the wife of the then-President of Singapore Yusof Ishak to a charity performance at the Singapore National Opera House. That same year, Teng performed at the Ten-Star Charity Performance, held by the Singaporean authorities. In 1971, she became the youngest person ever to be awarded the title of the &quot;Charity Queen&quot; of Hong Kong&#x27;s Bai Hua You Arts Auction for making charity sales. On 8 June 1973, Teng participated in the &quot;Far East Top Ten Stars Charity Gala&quot; in Singapore, gave four performances, and raised $400,000 to be used as scholarships for students in need. 

Teng continued performing for philanthropic causes throughout the 1970s in Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. In 1980, she raised over US$1 million for Yan Chai Hospital in Hong Kong and donated the proceeds of her show in Taiwan to that country&#x27;s national trust fund. In January 1982, Teng held a concert at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Hong Kong, and the first proceeds were used for charitable donations; in August, she donated NT$160,000 to build a water tower in a village in northern Thailand and introduce a drinking water system. In 1985, Teng held a solo concert at the NHK Hall in Tokyo, Japan, the proceeds of which were donated to charity. She made a special trip to Hong Kong in July 1991 to participate in the disaster relief program of ATV&#x27;s &quot;Love for East China&quot; as a special charity performance guest to raise funds. Teng gave her last performance in 1994 in Taiwan, a year before her sudden and unexpected death.

== Artistry ==
=== Influences ===
Teng credits Chinese folk songs and music as a major influence on her musical career, which she often grew up listening to. As a young child, Teng was exposed to music by her music-loving parents. Teng learned Peking opera through her father, while her mother introduced her to Huangmei opera, accompanying her to opera houses and encouraging Teng to sing in that style by purchasing songbooks for her. Alongside regional and folk styles, Teng was also influenced by shidaiqu and Japanese music. In addition to music, Teng was an admirer of Florence Nightingale, Xi Shi, and Lin Daiyu. 

=== Voice ===
Teng was a Soprano, according to &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot;. She possessed more than 3-octave vocal range: C3 (LowC) ~ E6 (HiE) and was known for her &quot;soothing and crystalline&quot; singing voice, with her vocal trademark classified as a &quot;quasi-whisper&quot;, which David B. Gordon characterizes as a &quot;private emotion&quot; in her listeners—as though she were singing for each of them individually. Examining her vocal abilities, NetEase Entertainment praised Teng&#x27;s soft voice style in the high range, describing her ability to &quot;sing the high notes from C5 to G5 with the strength and timbre of her natural voice.&quot; It also commended Teng&#x27;s breath control and her command in array of genres. Wang Yueyang from Sina News commented that &quot;Teng&#x27;s voice is very distinctive, soft, and soothing,&quot; stating that &quot;you can&#x27;t hear her breathing and she can sing continuous high notes without nasal sounds.&quot; Cultural critic Rey Chow has labelled Teng&#x27;s voice as soft, throaty, and feminine, whereas Mike Levin of &quot;Billboard&quot; described her voice as &quot;soft and almost breathless&quot;. Teng&#x27;s voice covered a diverse range of musical styles and languages. Meredith Schweig at Emory University notes that &quot;Teng was famously versatile: she performed confidently in multiple languages and seamlessly blended haipai, enka, and Euro-American pop stylings in dozens of hit records,&quot; and that Teng&#x27;s &quot;voice and physical appearance were venerated as the apotheosis of feminine beauty and virtue.&quot;

=== Lyrical writing ===
In 1987, Teng recorded the song &quot;Summer Christmas&quot;, a cover of the Japanese song &quot;Merry X&#x27;mas in Summer&quot;, originally recorded by Kuwata Band member Yoshisuke Kuwata. The same year, Teng recorded &quot;River of Destiny&quot;, a cover of the Japanese original &quot;Sadame Gawa&quot;. She composed the lyrics of both songs in Mandarin and included them on her 1987 Mandarin album, &quot;I Only Care About You&quot;. In 1988, Teng wrote the lyrics for the song &quot;We Are the Stars&quot; in both Chinese and Japanese versions and sang it on stage with Japanese musician Yūzō Kayama on 29 October. In 1992, Teng penned the lyrics for what was later revised into a song, &quot;Star&#x27;s Wish&quot;, after she died.

==Death and commemorations==

On 8 May 1995, Teng died suddenly and unexpectedly while on holiday in Chiang Mai, Thailand, at the age of 42. Several sources reported a severe asthma attack as the cause of her death; however, Thai doctors attributed Teng&#x27;s death to heart failure, but no autopsy was performed. Teng had complained of having respiratory difficulties since the beginning of the year. According to some witnesses, she was accompanied by her fiancé Paul Quilery, who was off scene when the attack occurred and had a rather indifferent attitude towards her sudden death. The cause of death was never confirmed, as both Teng and Quilery&#x27;s families declined to allow an autopsy. Later, the case was closed by the police due to a lack of evidence.

&quot;Billboard&quot; stated that Teng&#x27;s death &quot;produced a unified sense of loss throughout all of Asia&quot;. Her funeral in Taiwan became the largest state-sponsored funeral in the island&#x27;s history, second only to that of ROC leader Chiang Kai-shek. Over 200,000 people lined up outside the funeral home, waiting to bid their last farewells to Teng, causing traffic in Taipei to come to a standstill. Her funeral was broadcast on television stations across many Asian countries, while radio stations in Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong devoted their entire programming schedules to her music for two days. 

Teng was given state honors at her funeral, with Taiwan&#x27;s flag draped around her coffin. Hundreds of high-ranking officials and dignitaries, including commanders from three branches of the military, attended the funeral and accompanied Teng&#x27;s coffin to her grave. A day of national mourning was declared and President Lee Teng-hui was among the thousands in attendance. Teng was posthumously awarded the Ministry of Defense&#x27;s highest honor for civilians, the KMT&#x27;s &quot;Hua-hsia Grade One Medal&quot;, the Overseas Chinese Affairs&#x27; Commission&#x27;s &quot;Hua Guang Grade One Medal&quot;, and the president&#x27;s commendation. Teng was buried in a mountainside tomb at Chin Pao San, a cemetery in Jinshan, New Taipei City (then Taipei County) overlooking the north coast of Taiwan.

According to Teng&#x27;s maiden name character, Yun, the grave was named &quot;Yun Yuan&quot;. The gravesite features a golden-colored, life-size statue of her, and a large electronic piano keyboard set in the ground that can be played by visitors who step on the keys. On the tombstone, the head of Teng is carved. The coffin lid behind the tombstone is polished with black marble. Behind the coffin lid is a stone sculpture. The upper half is a lying portrait of the singer, and the right side of the lower half is inlaid with a color photo of her, with the words &quot;Deng Lijun, 1953–1995&quot; written on the left side. On the right side of the coffin lid, there is a huge stone with the words &quot;Yunyuan&quot; inscribed by James Soong, Governor of Taiwan Province. On the left side of the coffin lid, there is a stone stele on which is engraved with the epitaph: &quot;Here lies a superstar who dedicated her life to singing.&quot; The memorial is often visited by Teng&#x27;s fans.

In May 1995, Shanghai Radio host Dalù dedicated the Sunday morning broadcast to the Taiwanese singer, who died a few days earlier. Spreading her songs was banned in mainland China and the journalist was formally warned for this act. In 1995, a tribute album, &quot;A Tribute to Teresa Teng,&quot; was released, which contained covers of Teng&#x27;s songs by prominent Chinese rock bands. In May 2002, a wax figure of Teng was unveiled at Madame Tussauds Hong Kong. A house she bought in 1986 in Hong Kong at number 18 Carmel Street, Stanley also became a popular fan site soon after her death. Plans to sell the home to finance a museum in Shanghai were made known in 2002, and it was subsequently sold for HK $32 million. It closed on what would have been her 51st birthday on 29 January 2004.

==Legacy==

Throughout her 30-year career and up to this point, Teng has been recognized as one of the most celebrated and influential figures in Asian music and popular culture, considering her deep impact on the whole of Chinese society, with an influence extending beyond music to include both political and cultural spheres, while her Asia-wide reach is largely attributed to her multi-lingual abilities, which established her as an icon in all of Asia, heralding the era of region-wide pop superstardom that has become today&#x27;s norm. 

=== Cultural impact ===

Teng emerged as one of the biggest singers in the world in her heyday of the 1970s and 1980s, with many considering her the most famous Asian popstar of her time. Teng&#x27;s profound influence on Asian popular music and the Chinese cultural sphere throughout the latter half of the 20th century and beyond led to her being recognized as the Far East&#x27;s first pop superstar. She is credited by some as an enlightener and a pioneer of Chinese vocal performance art and modern popular music, opening up the performance paths of modern Chinese pop singers and enlightening the artistic dreams of many later musicians and cultural people.

Numerous musical and non-musical figures have been influenced by Teng. These include singer Faye Wong, Jay Chou, Jane Zhang, Kazukiyo Nishikiori of Japanese pop group Shonentai, Tetsuya Murakami of The Gospellers, Junko Akimoto, Rimi Natsukawa, &quot;father&quot; of Chinese rock Cui Jian, Romanian singer Cristina Boboacă, fashion designer Vivienne Tam, Nobel Prize laureate and writer Liu Xiaobo, poet and writer Xu Pei, manga artist Kenshi Hirokane, filmmaker Jia Zhangke, as well as painter and sculptor Jian Guo, among others.
==== China (PRC) ====

Prior to the 1980s, foreign music and art were largely prohibited in mainland China for nearly three decades. Love songs were almost non-existent, with the majority of music stemming from politics or red songs, which heavily dominated the country&#x27;s cultural domain. They were commonly revolutionary model operas promoting the ideals of the party and military. Jin Zhaojun, a prominent Chinese music critic, characterized the music of this period as &quot;overly masculine and lacking femininity,&quot; in which people were denied a whole range of basic human desires and modes of expression. Teng&#x27;s music, in this contrast, broke new ground in terms of style and content. She blended traditional Chinese folk music with Western pop and jazz, opening the doors to the musical creations of later generations. Musicians began to study the new forms of music that entered the mainland through foreign cassettes and tape recorders, such as orchestration and singing style. She became the earliest guide for composers on how to arrange music for popular songs, and numerous musicians reproduced their work by imitating her. An important piece of testimony to this is the use of saxophone introduced by Teng. Her frequent use of jazz or jazz-influenced ensembles in her music set the standard for saxophone performance practice in mainland pop today. Another aspect of Teng&#x27;s influence was the establishment of a &quot;breath singing method&quot;. Jin pointed out that, before this, alongside more authentic folk singing, the Chinese also had a &quot;national singing&quot; between bel canto and folk singing. Teng taught that people could also sing with another part of their voice, which was later named &quot;popular singing&quot;. 

Teng&#x27;s songs were centered on a range of subjects, most primarily love and human relations—the most lacking elements in mainland culture at the time. By the early 1970s, as rates of radio ownership began to increase, especially of cheap and portable transistor models, listening to Teng&#x27;s music became the primary attraction. Author Ah Cheng recalled hearing her music for the first time in 1975 as a sort of excitement and extreme addiction that he and his friends would press their ears to the wooden frame of a shortwave radio only to get her voice heard. His account of his internal exile in the mountains of Yunnan is better representative of this phenomenon:Yunnan was endowed with a magnificent geographical gift: you could hardly hear central people&#x27;s radio, and the newspaper would take days to make its way into the mountains and then be collected at the party&#x27;s secretary&#x27;s house, where you could ask him to tear off a strip when you wanted to roll up a cigarette. For people who listen to enemy radio, radio from the center or the official newspaper was merely a supplemental reference. But listening to enemy radio was not about political news so much as entertainment. I remember that whenever the Australian national station broadcast a radio play of the Taiwanese film The Story of a Small Town everyone would bring their own radio because the shortwave signal would tend to drift and that way we could cover the entire frequency range and make sure we had continuous sound from at least one receiver at a time. The boys and girls sitting around that grass hut would be in tears! Especially when Teresa Teng&#x27;s voice rang out, emotions would rise to a fever pitch – her voice was to die for.The popularity of Teng&#x27;s music among her listeners marked the birth of China&#x27;s fan culture. Without the technology to communicate, fans organized their own groups of fandom by sharing her tapes or discussing her music together. Teng&#x27;s music fandom is considered the earliest stage of the development of the Chinese pop culture fandom, before which no popular media could be found. In 1977, Teng&#x27;s popular love song &quot;The Moon Represents My Heart&quot; was released; it became one of the first foreign songs to break into the country. Her songs over the following decade revolutionized Chinese popular culture, which marked the end of the extremely tight control exercised in the preceding three decades by the communist party over Chinese society and culture.

Author Ah Cheng cited Teng&#x27;s songs, an inspiration for the revival of popular culture on the mainland. Wu&#x27;erkaixi, a Chinese political commentator of Uyghur heritage, asserted that the youngsters who listened to her songs discovered the desire for the pursuit of freedom through her singing voice. He adds that &quot;to the Chinese, Deng Lijun was a great person. If Deng Xiaoping brought economic freedom to China, she brought liberation of the body and free thinking to China.&quot;

According to Nobel Peace Prize laureate and writer Liu Xiaobo, &quot;Teng&#x27;s romantic songs reawakened our soft centers by dismantling the cast-iron frame work of our &quot;revolutionary wills,&quot; melting our cold, unfeeling hearts, reviving sexual desires, and liberating our long-suppressed human softness and tenderness.&quot; Filmmaker Jia Zhangke said that Teng&#x27;s songs were a big inspiration that drove his curiosity towards cinema. He relates: &quot;Her songs represented a massive transformation in the cultural landscape of China at that time. Prior to the 1980s, China had no popular culture to speak of. The closest thing we had were revolutionary model operas and things made in that mold. Everything around us was structured collectively: we, but Teng&#x27;s songs, on the other hand, were entirely new at the time.. they evoked individual desire: me, changing everything.&quot; Regarding her contribution to the development of the music industry in China, Wang Xiaofeng at Sanlian Lifeweek wrote, &quot;Teng not only pioneered the development of popular music but also stimulated the rapid development of audio-video companies at that time.&quot; He stated that listening to tapes was one of the main cultural activities and that they were luxury goods, but this did not stop ordinary people from consuming them. In 1979, there were only a few audio-video distribution companies in the Mainland. By 1982, it had increased to 300, indicating Teng&#x27;s music as the trailblazer for this change.

==== Beyond China (PRC) ====

Teng became popular in Japan and Southeast Asia, and to some extent, South Asia, achieving a &quot;cult status&quot; in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Mainland China, and Japan, where she became a &quot;barometer of cross-strait relations&quot; in rising geopolitical tensions at the time, and one of the first artists to break through linguistic and cultural barriers, garnering recognition and acclaim from cultures across much of the region that had previously been confined to national borders. Teng&#x27;s songs have been covered by hundreds of artists all over the world, such as Faye Wong, Leslie Cheung, Jon Bon Jovi, Siti Nurhaliza, Shila Amzah, Katherine Jenkins, Im Yoon-ah, David Archuleta, Agnez Mo, Greek singer Nana Mouskouri, English vocal group Libera, Jewish singer Noa, Grammy Award-winning American musician Kenny G, Kiwi pianist Carl Doy, Cuba&#x27;s leading a cappella musical band Vocal Sampling, among others. Her songs are also featured in various international films, such as &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;, &quot;The Game&quot;, &quot;Prison On Fire&quot;, &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot;, &quot;Formosa Betrayed&quot;, &quot;Gomorrah&quot;, &quot;Crazy Rich Asians&quot;, and the Disney + TV series &quot;American Born Chinese&quot;.

In 1974, Teng entered the Japanese market, two years after Japan severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan. She was extremely popular in Japan throughout the 1970s and 1980s, having lived off her royalties in the country after semi-retiring in the late &#x27;80s. During this tenure, Teng recorded and performed Japanese pop songs, often termed as kayokyoku by Japanese media, and helped connect Japan to much of East Asia, particularly Taiwan, China, and some of Southeast Asia, helping bridge the gap between them, some of which were later covered in Mandarin, as reported by &quot;Nippon.&quot;

Hirano Kumiko, an author at &quot;Nippon&quot; writes:For Japanese, Teresa Teng was more than just a popular singer. By performing kayōkyoku, she connected Japan to its Asian neighbors. She taught us about the profundity of Chinese culture, whether in her birthplace of Taiwan, her ancestral home of China, or Hong Kong, which she loved throughout her life. We, her Japanese fans, will never forget her velvety voice and the brief, beautiful radiance of her life.

In 2007, Teng was inducted into the &quot;Popular Music Hall of Fame&quot; at the Koga Masao Music Museum in Japan, making her the only non-Japanese national to do so. In 2015, on an occasion to commemorate the 20th death anniversary of the singer, Akira Tada from &quot;Nikkei Asia&quot; wrote, &quot;Asia has undergone significant changes in the past 20 years, with the flow of people, goods, and information having increased considerably. At the same time, new political frictions have developed. Teng, who continues to be loved across national and ethnic boundaries, still shines as a voice uniting Asia through song.&quot; In 2018, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;In 20th-century pop music, the voice of Elvis Presley is as iconic and identifiable in the west as that of Teresa Teng is in the east.&quot; According to Rolling Stone Philippines: &quot;Teng&#x27;s influence on Philippine music and pop culture has rekindled Filipinos&#x27; love for Mandopop across generations and communities throughout the Philippines.&quot; Andrew N. Weintraub and Bart Barendregt described her as &quot;a model of inter-Asian modernity whose voice crossed linguistic, national and generational borders&quot;, whereas John F. Copper called her &quot;the most heard singer in the world ever&quot; during her time.

=== Achievements and honors ===

Considered a &quot;brilliant linguist&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Teng was named one of the world&#x27;s seven greatest female singers by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1986. In a national survey by Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) in 1997, her song &quot;Toki no Nagare ni Mi o Makase&quot; was voted number 16 among the 100 greatest Japanese songs of all time, while her The Moon Represents My Heart ranked first among the 10 best Chinese classics of the 20th century in a poll by Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) in 1999. In 2008, Teng was the only singer to be selected among China&#x27;s 30 outstanding people in 30 years of reform and opening up. In 2009, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, a government web portal conducted an online poll to choose &quot;The Most Influential Cultural Figure in China since 1949&quot;. Over 24 million people voted, and Teng came out as the winner with 8.5 million votes. 
In 2010, on the eve of &quot;March 8th International Women&#x27;s Day,&quot; she was named &quot;the most influential woman in modern China&quot; in a poll conducted by many well-known Chinese media from 1 March to 8 March. At the 2010 Chinese Music Awards, her song The Moon Represents My Heart was ranked first by critics among the 30 greatest Chinese musical works of the past 30 years. The same year, CNN listed Teng among the 20 most influential music artists of the past 50 years. In 2011, Teng&#x27;s song The Moon Represents My Heart topped the online survey to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. The same year, China Internet Information Center ranked her second on its list of top 10 Chinese celebrities who died young. In 2012, Commonwealth Magazine placed Teng at number 19 on its 50 most influential people in Taiwan in the last 400 years, making her the highest-ranked performer on the list. On 21 September 2024, an Indo-Pacific Strategic Think Tank (IPST) in cooperation with Sankei Shimbun&#x27;s polling company conducted a poll among 3,000 respondents in Japan on &quot;Who is the most famous person in Taiwan?&quot; Teng topped the poll, garnering 53.8% of the total votes. The poll was conducted across eight cities in Japan with respondents aged above 18. 

The 1996 Hong Kong film &quot;&quot;, directed by Peter Chan, features the tragedy and legacy of Teng in a subplot to the main story. The movie won Best Picture in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and at the Seattle International Film Festival in the United States. In 2007, TV Asahi produced a drama series entitled &quot;Teresa Teng Monogatari&quot; () to commemorate the 13th anniversary of her death. Actress Yoshino Kimura starred as Teng.

In 2002, Teng&#x27;s commemorative statue was erected in Fushou Garden, Qingpu District, Shanghai. In 2010, a bronze statue was unveiled in Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, and another outside the Luzhou metro station in Taiwan on 25 June 2011. In 2015, a temple in Changhua County, Taiwan, erected a statue of the singer, honoring her as &quot;Miaoyun Bodhisattva&quot;. That same year, the Daming County government in Handan City, Hebei province, China, built a &quot;Lijun Town&quot; dedicated to her. It renovated Teng&#x27;s ancestral home to its original appearance. Her singing can be heard in every corner of the town. The city also features the &quot;Teresa Teng Hanging Garden&quot; and the &quot;Teresa Teng Art Center&quot;, including a statue of the singer. Visitors can enjoy her music through artificial intelligence technology. 

On 29 January 2018, a Google Doodle was released across Japan, China, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, India, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Bulgaria, and Iceland to honor Teng on what have been be her 65th birthday. To date, Teng&#x27;s stamps have been issued by countries across the world, including Papua New Guinea, Timor, Sierra Leone, Argentina, Liberia, Tuva Republic of Russia, Abkhazia, Grenada, Sakha Republic of Russia, Batum, Japan, Guinea-Bissau, North Korea, and Republic of Mali, in addition to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China. Teng has a street in her name in Ivry-sur-Seine, Grand Paris. The name was adopted by the vote of the Municipal council of France held on 17 February 2022.

==Personal life==

Like her maternal grandmother Mary Chang (), Teng grew up Roman Catholic. As a child, she often spent her time playing around St. Joseph Catholic Church in Luzhou, where she received baptism. Later on, Teng became a Buddhist and spent her last six years living quietly in France. 

In 1971, Teng met her first boyfriend, Lin Zhenfa (), a Malaysian paper tycoon, and they soon fell in love. In 1978, he died of a heart attack. Later, Teng, accompanied by her close friends, went to the cemetery to pay respects to her boyfriend. In 1980, while in the US, Teng met Jackie Chan, who was filming in Hollywood. However, due to their personality differences, their relationship was short-lived and they parted ways.

In 1982, Teng was engaged to Beau Kuok, a Malaysian businessman and the son of multi-billionaire Robert Kuok. However, Beau&#x27;s grandmother imposed several conditions on their union, including that Teng cease her career as an entertainer as well as fully disclose her biography and all her past relationships in writing. However, Teng turned down the proposal, and the marriage was called off. In 1990, Teng met French photographer Paul Quilery in France, who was a friend of a guitarist in her band. They dated for five years and got engaged a month before Teng died on 8 May 1995.

== Notes ==

# ^ Her birth name 鄧麗筠; &quot;Dèng Lìyún&quot; was commonly mispronounced &quot;Dèng Lìjūn&quot; (&quot;jūn&quot; is an alternative reading of the final character 筠), so she later adopted 鄧麗君; &quot;Dèng Lìjūn&quot; as her stage name, changing the final character, to match that pronunciation.

<text>Riot control measures are used by law enforcement, military, paramilitary or security forces to control, disperse, and arrest people who are involved in a riot, unlawful demonstration or unlawful protest.

If a riot is both spontaneous and irrational, then actions which cause people to stop and think for a moment (e.g. loud noises or issuing instructions in a calm tone) can be enough to stop it. However, these methods usually fail when there is severe anger with a legitimate cause, or the riot was planned or organized. Riot control personnel have long used less lethal weapons such as batons and whips to disperse crowds and detain rioters. Since the 1980s, riot control officers have also used tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, stun grenades, and electric tasers. In some cases, riot squads may also use Long Range Acoustic Devices, water cannons, armoured fighting vehicles, aerial surveillance, police dogs or mounted police on horses. Persons performing riot control typically wear protective equipment such as riot helmets, face visors, body armor (vests, neck protectors, knee pads, etc.), gas masks and riot shields. Even though riot tactics are effective in controlling crowds, they can also lead to significant psychological effects on both the rioters and the police. Exposure to intense fear, stress, and violence during these confrontations can result in long-term mental health issues, like anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and heightened aggression, which can impact the well-being of protesters and police officers.

There have been cases where lethal weapons are used to violently suppress a protest or riot, as in the Tbilisi Massacre, Nika Riots in the Roman Empire, Boston Massacre, Haymarket Massacre, Banana Massacre, Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Kent State Shootings, Soweto Uprising, Sharpeville massacre, Mendiola Massacre, Bloody Sunday (1905), Ponce massacre, Río Piedras massacre, Bloody Sunday (1972), 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, 2017 Venezuelan protests, 2018–2019 Gaza border protests, 2022 Sri Lankan protests, 2022 Kazakh unrest and Mahsa Amini protests.

==History==

Maintaining order during demonstrations and quenching riots has always been a challenge for governments and administrations. Until early in the 20th century, no dedicated force really existed in most countries and the traditional response when the regular police force proved inadequate was to call upon the army, often with disastrous results: either fraternization or use of excessive violence.

The terminology arguably first arises in the Keystone Cops short &quot;A Hash House Fraud&quot; in 1915.

In France, for example, several revolts were fueled by poor handling by the military. The National Gendarmerie created specialized &quot;mobile&quot; gendarmerie forces several times during the 19th century in times of trouble but these units were disbanded soon after the end of the troubles they had been tasked to handle and there was no permanent organization in place until it was finally decided in 1921 to create &quot;Mobile Gendarmerie platoons&quot; within the Departmental Gendarmerie. These platoons, either horse mounted or on foot were composed of 40 gendarmes each (60 in the Paris Region). In 1926, the platoons formed the &quot;Garde Républicaine mobile&quot; (mobile republican guard or GRM), which became a distinct branch of the Gendarmerie in 1927, the platoons becoming part of companies and legions. By 1940, the GRM was a force 21,000 strong, composed of 14 Légions, 54 company groups and 167 companies.

Long the only large force specialized in maintaining or restoring law and order in France during demonstrations or riots, the GRM progressively developed the doctrine and skills needed in that role: exercise restraint, avoid confrontation as long as possible, always leave an &quot;exit door&quot; for the crowd, etc. In 1940, after the fall of France, the German authorities had the GRM disbanded but it was reinstated in 1944 and renamed Mobile Gendarmerie in 1954.
The first squad trained in modern techniques of riot control in Asia was formed in 1925 in colonial Shanghai as a response to the mismanaged riot of the May Thirtieth Movement.

New policing methods, including combat pistol shooting, hand to hand combat skills, and knife fight training, were pioneered by British Assistant Commissioner William E. Fairbairn and officer Eric Anthony Sykes of the Shanghai Municipal Police as a response to a staggering rise in armed crime in the Shanghai had become one of the world&#x27;s most dangerous cities due to a breakdown in law and order in the country and the growth of organised crime and the opium trade.

Under Fairbairn, the SMP developed a myriad of riot control measures. These riot control techniques led to the introduction of Shanghai&#x27;s &quot;Reserve Unit&quot;, used to forcibly disband riots and respond to high-level crimes such as kidnappings and armed robberies. The skills developed in Shanghai have been adopted and adapted by both international police forces and clandestine warfare units. Fairbairn was again the central figure, not only leading the Reserve Unit, but teaching his methods around the world, including in the United States, and colonial Cyprus and the Straits Settlements.

== Modern Examples ==
=== Black Lives Matter protests ===

George Floyd was a Black man who was murdered by a Minneapolis Police Officer in May of 2020 during an arrest. Subsequently, many Americans protested for &quot;Black Lives Matter.&quot; The summer of 2020 oversaw a large number of mass protests for Black Lives Matter to address systemic bias in police departments. Due to the high volume of protests, police departments and sparsely the National Guard were sent to end the long protests. Police departments often wore riot gear and used both projectiles and irritants to disperse the protesters. These incidents were widely documented through the use of social media. Documentation and support for the protests further facilitated the movement. One study, recorded by the National Institute of Health, studied the usage of social media as well as its contributions to the movement&#x27;s legitimacy. Counter-protesters as well as right wing militia committed violence against the protesters in addition to police departments. Instead of irritants or other standardized tools for riot control, these counter-protesters often used more violent techniques such as ramming into protesters with their cars. Data supports that Black Lives Matter protests in particular were faced with much more state intervention. Suppression techniques that were used by both the state and right wing counter-protesters resulted in injury and death. Both during and after the protests, there were many pieces of legislation that either were passed or were written to curb these protests. Law makers and the public questioned riot control and its violations of the First Amendment including the right to assembly and the right to free speech. 45 U.S. states had considered this legislation. Concerns were raised by both political parties on the distinction between riots and protests.

=== Peru protests ===

Between 2022 and 2023, several protests in Peru erupted who were against the Congress and President Dina Bolurate. In December of 2022, the government suspended several constitutional rights. These included the right to prevent troops from entering and staying in one&#x27;s home, the freedom of movement, and the freedom of assembly. The force used against the protesters resulted in at least six hundred injuries and sixty deaths. Spain had traditionally funded the government in past years and continued to do so to provide weaponry and funding to dismantle these protests. The NGO Amnesty International called on Spain to discontinue these exports citing it as &quot;lethal repression.&quot; The security forces came in with assault weapons and in one incident opened fire on protesters. Amnesty International interpreted that the President should be held criminally responsible for the deaths and injuries that the protesters had sustained.

==Equipment==

For protection, officers that are trained in police anti-riot schools performing riot control will often wear protective helmets and carry riot shields. These are designed to protect the wearer from those dangers that come from direct melee and hurled objects such as bottles and bricks. The gear frequently worn by riot control officers protects the entire body with no vulnerable spots to exploit. For example, the helmets worn by riot control officers have an additional outward-extending part that protects the back of the neck from assault. To provide even greater protection, the protective equipment often provides ballistic protection. If tear gas or other riot control agents are to be used, gas masks may also be worn. While the visual of police in full riot gear may be intimidating, today&#x27;s riot suits are designed to minimize injuries and prevent fatalities for both officers and citizens. This evolution of riot gear signifies a move towards less-than-lethal tactics and de-escalation approaches. Contemporary riot gear incorporated innovations such as tear gas, rubber bullets, batons, pepper spray, and tasers, which contributes to minimizing injuries and casualties for all parties involved. These advancements have revolutionized crowd control by shifting from relying on lethal force to employing more less-than-lethal methods that prioritize public safety and safeguard the well-being of law enforcement officers.

One of many additional concerns is to prevent people in the crowd from snatching officers&#x27; side arms, which may be stolen or even used against the police. In a very heavy crowd, the officer may not be able to see who is responsible for snatching a weapon, and may not even notice that it has happened. For this reason, riot police may have holsters with positive locking mechanisms or other extra means of retention, if their agencies can afford such tools. However, this can be a trade-off that increases the amount of time needed to draw the sidearm in an emergency. Alternately, riot police may not carry sidearms at all.

The initial choice of tactics determines the type of offensive equipment used. The base choice is between lethal (e.g. 12 gauge shotgun) and less-than-lethal weaponry (e.g. tear gas, pepper spray, plastic bullets, tasers, batons, and other incapacitants). The decision is based on the perceived level of threat and the existing laws; in many countries it is illegal to use lethal force to control riots in all but the most extreme circumstances.

Special riot hand weapons include the wooden or rubber baton; the African sjambok, a heavy leather or plastic whip, and the Indian lathi, a long cane with a blunt metal tip. Vehicle-mounted water cannons may serve to augment personal weapons. Some water cannons let police add dye to mark rioters or tear gas to help disperse the crowds.

In major unrest, police in armoured vehicles may be sent in following an initial subduing with firepower. Occasionally, police dogs, fire hoses, or mounted police are deployed.

== Riot control agent (RCA) ==

Riot control agents (sometimes called RCAs) are non-lethal lachrymatory agents used for riot control. Most commonly used riot control agents are pepper spray and various kinds of tear gas. These chemicals enable to disperse a protesting or rioting crowd, or to clear a building. They can rapidly produce sensory irritation or disabling physical effects which usually disappear within 15 minutes (for tear gas) and up to 2 hours (for pepper spray) following termination of exposure. They can also be used for chemical warfare defense training, but their use in warfare itself is a violation of Article I.5 of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Article II.9 of the CWC specifically authorizes their use for domestic law enforcement.

===Pepper spray===

The active ingredient in pepper-spray is capsaicin, which is a chemical derived from the fruit of plants in the &quot;Capsicum&quot; genus, including chilies. Desmethyldihydrocapsaicin, a synthetic analogue of capsaicin also known as pelargonic acid vanillylamide or PAVA, is used in another version of pepper spray known as PAVA spray and used in the United Kingdom. Another synthetic counterpart of pepper spray, pelargonic acid morpholide, was developed and is widely used in Russia. Its effectiveness compared to natural pepper spray is uncertain and it reportedly has caused some injuries. When undesirables threaten an area, such as a riot after a soccer game, riot police are called in to subdue them. In these situations, the police may use pepper spray, or water cannons to neutralize the threat.

Pepper spray typically comes in canisters, which are often small enough to be carried or concealed in a pocket or purse. Pepper spray can also be bought concealed in items such as rings. There are also pepper spray projectiles available, which can be fired from a paintball gun. Having been used for years against demonstrators, it is increasingly being used by police in routine interventions.

===Tear gas===

Tear gas is a non-specific term for any chemical that is used to temporarily incapacitate through irritation of eyes and/or respiratory system. It is used as a hand-held spray or can be fired in canisters that heat up spewing out an aerosol cloud at a steady rate.

While the use of tear gas in warfare is prohibited by various international treaties that most countries have signed, use by police and for private self-defense is not banned by these treaties.

Popular tear gases include the eye irritants ortho-chlorobenzylidene-malononitrile (CS gas), chloroacetophenone (CN gas), and dibenz (b,f)-1,4-oxazepine (CR gas). Among a long list of substances, these three have become of greater importance than the others because of their effectiveness and low risks when used. Today, CS has largely replaced CN as the most widely used tear gas internationally. 

====Decontamination====

At room temperature, tear gases are white solids. They are stable when heated and have low vapor pressure. Consequently, they are usually dispersed as aerosols. All of them have low solubility in water but can be dissolved in several organic solvents. Hydrolysis of CN is very slow in a water solution, especially if alkali is added. CS is rapidly hydrolyzed in water solution (half-life at pH 7 is about 15 min. at room temperature) and extremely rapid when alkali is added (half-life at pH 9 is about 1 min.). CR is hydrolyzed only to a negligible extent in water solution.

CN and CR are, thus, difficult to decompose under practical conditions, whereas CS can easily be inactivated by means of a water solution. Skin is suitably decontaminated of CS and CN gas by thorough washing with soap and water. CS is then decomposed, whereas CN is only removed via soap and water. The effects of CR gas are greatly increased by water, causing any attempt to DECON CR via soap and water to increase the severity and duration of the effects. When decontamination of CR is attempted with soap and water the effects of CR can last up to 48 hours

Decontamination of material after contamination with CR gas is not possible for up to 45 days. CS can be decontaminated l with a 5–10 percent soda solution or 2 percent alkaline solution. If this type of decontamination cannot be accomplished (e.g., contaminated rooms and furniture), then the only other means is by intensive air exchange—preferably with hot air. Exposed streets and sidewalks will have toxic and irritating CS powder that will be stirred into the air by traffic and pedestrians long after the cloud has dissipated, and should be washed away with water. In contrast to human beings, domesticated animals generally have lower sensitivity to tear gases. Dogs and horses can therefore be used by police for riot control even when tear gas is used.

===Dispensing large quantities===
Backpack dispensers for riot control agents, when the intent is to use a larger quantity than possible with grenades, are one type of device used by organizations that might, for example, need to cover a prison yard. Dispensers are also made for attachment to helicopters; see CBU-19.

==Tactics==

The front-line officers in a riot control are often fully armored and carry weapons such as batons, designed to be in direct contact with the crowd. These officers subdue rioters and subsequently allow the less heavily armoured, more mobile officers to make arrests where it is deemed necessary. In face of a greater threat, the riot police will be backed up with other officers equipped with riot guns to fire tear gas, rubber bullets, plastic bullets or &quot;beanbag&quot; rounds.

As a less aggressive step, mounted police may first be sent into the crowd. The might and height offered by the horse are combined with its training, allowing an officer to more safely infiltrate a crowd. Usually, when front-facing a riot, officers slowly walk in a line parallel to the riot&#x27;s front, extending to both its ends, as they noisily and simultaneously march and beat their shields with their batons, to cause fear and psychological effects on the crowd.

In the United Kingdom, usually when large demonstrations take place that are deemed unstable, the territorial police force responsible for the demonstration in that area will usually deploy Police Support Unit personnel who are trained in riot tactics, along with normal divisional officers. If the demonstration turns violent, police will seal roads and other exits to contain protesters in a single area (known as kettling) to prevent widespread damage and wait until the protesters tire. These tactics were seen during the 2009 G-20 London summit protests and the 2010 student protests in London. Tear gas and other more offensive tactics are used as a last resort. Throughout police will be videoing or photographing protesters for future arrests, &quot;snatch squad&quot; tactics might also be used where several police officers, usually in protective riot gear, rush forwards, occasionally in flying wedge formation to break through the front of a crowd, with the objective of snatching one or more individuals from a riot that are attempting to control the demonstration at which they are present; the target may be a leader or a speaker, or someone who seems to be leading the crowd. This tactic was used in the 2011 England Riots, most notably by Greater Manchester Police who deployed this tactic in Manchester city centre on 9 August 2011.

A more straightforward tactic police may use is a baton charge which involves police officers charging at a crowd of people with batons and in some cases, riot shields. They run at the crowd hitting people with their batons, and in some situations use riot shields to push them away. Baton charging is designed to cause the maximum amount of pain, in the hope that they would be compelled to move away from the scene, dispersing the crowd.

== Consequences ==
There has been public controversy when it has come to the tactics of riot control. Moral and legal questions have emerged regarding constitutional rights such as the right to assembly as well as free speech. This form of state violence is also controversial as discussions have emerged regarding the legitimacy as well as the ethics of containing protests. There are discussions on the implications of the perceived military-civilian split. For example, the United States regards its police as civilians. However, the ambiguity of the laws allows for the police to act as military in conflicts with U.S. citizens which has typically been seen as legitimate or at least legal.

There are also legitimate health and safety concerns. Some effects of riot agents include irritation, runny nose, chest tightness, coughing as well as swelling. Long term effects include blindness and respiratory failure. Death can also occur instantly due to chemical burns and respiratory failure. Different countries use different methods of riot control. Chloroacetophenone, chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (tear gas) and dibenzoxazepine are common ingredients for riot control. These are highly toxic and cancerous. Countries often have different standards for usage of chemicals like capsaicin (pepper spray) and who is allowed to own and use these chemicals for self-defense. Some scholars have called for natural alternatives to limit long term health effects like those found in the Capsicum genus and the Zingiber genus.

== Psychological toll on protesters and Police officers ==
As protests and riots rage on throughout the world, there is an ongoing concern that riot control is having an impact on individuals&#x27; mental health. This rise in protests has caused an inevitable increase in law-enforcement violence, which has profound impacts on the mental health of protesters and police officers, including PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Studies have shown that rubber bullets, water cannons, and tear gas cause not only problems like eye irritation and external and internal injuries, but can also cause individuals to develop psychological issues. This all comes after the American Public Health Association named police violence as a &quot;public health issue,&quot; making it crucial to study the psychological effects caused by riots.

The Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests are an example that has been studied due to its psychological health effects, stemming from the severe nature of the police response. During these protests in Hong Kong, the police reportedly used upwards of 16,000 canisters of tear gas on these protesters. A survey of the Hong Kong protesters found that 25.7% of the population experienced depression, while 9.1% had thoughts of committing suicide. There were similar findings during the Arab Spring in Egypt, where school children in schools near the Tahrir Square (the location of massive riots) were experiencing higher rates of depression. In France, it was found that Yellow Vest protesters who encountered police violence had a 1.54% higher likelihood of experiencing severe depressive symptoms and were 2.58 times more likely to exhibit signs indicative of PTSD. In the whole scheme of police violence towards protesters, it is said that people who were involved in or just living in areas affected by riots could experience an uptick in PTSD by 4% to 41%.

Risk factors that can exacerbate mental health issues from riots:

* Lower socioeconomic status
* Female sex
* Prior exposure to violence
* Excessive social media use
* Lack of support from family and friends
* Ongoing personal conflicts

=== Psychological Effects on Police Officers ===
When considering the psychological effects of riot control, it is important to also examine how police officers are impacted by riots. They are exposed to some of the same risks and challenges, such as having objects thrown at them, being physically assaulted, and being exposed to RCA’s. Even without considering riots, police officers already have almost double the risk of developing PTSD, depression, and anxiety than the average person. When working the frontline of a riot is added, these numbers are bound to go up. For example, during the unrest after the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the number of recorded cases of PTSD among police officers increased upwards of 30%. With the increase in mental illness from the civil unrest and public scrutiny, many police officers resigned, resorted to substance abuse, and even suicide.

Symptoms that Police Officer may face after riots:

* Increased heart rate
* Nervousness or restlessness
* Trembling
* Sweating
* Reduced Appetite
* Anxiety or restlessness
* Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death

=== January 6th Riots ===
January 6th, 2021, was a trying time for all Americans as protesters stormed the Capitol Building in Washington D.C. In the process, they beat, trampled, sprayed police officers with chemicals, overwhelmed the police, and almost killed numerous police officers who attempted to stop them from entering the Capitol. In response to this horrific event, members of the Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police Department are to this day suffering from PTSD, anxiety, and depression. The trauma was so significant that Police Officers Bobby Tabron and DeDivine K. Carter of the Metropolitan Police Department filed a lawsuit against former President, Donald J. Trump. They cite that by inciting the mob, Donald Trump caused them &quot;severe injuries&quot; and great &quot;emotional distress.&quot; Both officers still suffer from recurrent dreams and thoughts of the horrific attack on the Nation&#x27;s Capitol Building. Beyond this lawsuit, multiple police officers who responded to the Capitol committed suicide in the following months:

* Metropolitan Police Officer Gunther Hashida
* Metropolitan Police Officer Kyle DeFreytag
* Capitol Police Officer Howard Liebengood
* Metropolitan Police Officer Jeffrey Smith

When looking at the January 6th riots, they present a contradiction, as many of the attendees were Republicans, which tend to favor and support the police There has become a shift now where Republicans have become more in favor of a limited government in order to conserve their freedoms. In terms of numbers, 80% of Republicans in the House of Representatives now favor the defunding of police departments. 

==Research==

Research into weapons that are more effective for riot control continues. Netguns are non-lethal weapons designed to fire a net which entangles the target. Netguns have a long history of being used to capture wildlife, without injury, for research purposes. A netgun is currently in development for non-lethal riot control. Pepper-spray projectile launchers are projectile weapons that launch a fragile ball which breaks upon impact and releases an irritant powder called PAVA (capsaicin II) pepper. The launchers are often slightly modified .68 caliber paintball guns.

Stink bombs are devices designed to create an extremely unpleasant smell for riot control and area denial purposes. Stink bombs are believed to be less dangerous than other riot control chemicals, since they are effective at low concentrations. Sticky foam weapons are being tested, which cover and immobilize rioters with a gooey foam.

Low frequency sound cannons are weapons of various types that use sound to injure or incapacitate subjects using a focused beam of sound or infrasound. Active denial systems (ADS) are a non-lethal, directed-energy weapon developed by the U.S. military. The ADS directs electromagnetic radiation, specifically, high-frequency microwave radiation, at a frequency of 95 GHz, which causes the water in the upper epidermis to boil, stimulating a &quot;burning&quot; sensation in the nerve endings and generating intense pain. Dazzler lasers are directed-energy weapons that use intense light to cause temporary blindness or disorientation of rioters.

<text>The Four Olds () refer to categories used by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution to characterize elements of Chinese culture prior to the Chinese Communist Revolution that they were attempting to destroy. The Four Olds were &#x27;old ideas&#x27;, &#x27;old culture&#x27;, &#x27;old customs&#x27;, and &#x27;old habits&#x27;. During the Red August of 1966, shortly after the onset of the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards&#x27; campaign to destroy the Four Olds began amid the massacres being carried out in Beijing.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;Four Olds&quot; first appeared on June 1, 1966, in Chen Boda&#x27;s &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; editorial, &quot;Sweep Away All Cow Demons and Snake Spirits&quot;, where the Old Things were described as anti-proletarian, &quot;fostered by the exploiting classes, [and to] have poisoned the minds of the people for thousands of years&quot;. However, which customs, cultures, habits, and ideas specifically constituted the &quot;Four Olds&quot; were never clearly defined.

On August 8, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party used the term at its 8th National Congress. The term was endorsed on August 18 by Lin Biao at a mass rally, and from there it spread to &quot;Red Flag&quot; magazine, as well as to Red Guard publications.

Calls to destroy the &quot;Four Olds&quot; usually did not appear in isolation, but were contrasted with the hope of building the &quot;Four News&quot; (new customs, new culture, new habits, new ideas). Newborn socialist things were said to struggle against the Four Olds. The idea that Chinese culture was responsible for China&#x27;s economic backwardness and needed to be reformed had some precedent in the May Fourth Movement (1919), and was also encouraged by colonial authorities during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

==Campaign to destroy the Four Olds==
The campaign to Destroy the Four Olds and Cultivate the Four News () began in Beijing on August 19 during the &quot;Red August&quot;. Academic Alessandro Russo writes that the destruction of the Four Olds was an ambiguous campaign from the perspective of the Chinese Communist Party. He argues that in a time of increasing political pluralization, the Party sought to channel student activism towards obvious class enemies and less relevant objectives to make it easier for the Party to contain the situation.

=== The &quot;re-naming&quot; campaign ===

Across China, signs bearing old road names were vandalized. The first things to change were the names of streets and stores: &quot;Blue Sky Clothes Store&quot; to &quot;Defending Mao Zedong Clothes Store&quot;, &quot;Cai E Road&quot; to &quot;Red Guards Road&quot;, and so forth.

In Beijing, the name of the road where the embassy of the Soviet Union was stationed was changed to &quot;Anti-revisionism Road.&quot; The Peking Union Medical College Hospital, founded in 1921 by the Rockefeller Foundation, was renamed &quot;Anti-Imperialist Hospital&quot;.

In Huangpu district of Shanghai, the city&#x27;s commercial center, Red Guards tore down 93 percent of shop signboards (2,166 of 2,328), and renamed restaurants, schools and hospitals. Red Guards also took Nanjing Road as their revolutionary headquarters in Shanghai, renaming it the &quot;Anti-Imperialism Street&quot;.

Many people across China also changed their given names to revolutionary slogans, such as Zhihong (, &quot;Determined Red&quot;), Jige (, &quot;Following the Revolution&quot;) and Weidong (卫东, &quot;Safeguard the Orient or Protect Mao&quot;).

=== Public sites ===
The Cemetery of Confucius was attacked in November 1966, during the Cultural Revolution, when it was visited and vandalized by a team of Red Guards from Beijing Normal University, led by Tan Houlan. The corpse of the 76th-generation Duke Yansheng was removed from its grave and hung naked from a tree in front of the palace during the desecration of the cemetery in the Cultural Revolution.

The Chinese government stopped short of endorsing the physical destruction of products. In fact, the government protected significant archaeological discoveries made during the Cultural Revolution, such as the Mawangdui, the Leshan Giant Buddha and the Terracotta Army. Upon learning that Red Guards were approaching the Forbidden City, Premier Zhou Enlai ordered the gates shut immediately and deployed the People&#x27;s Liberation Army against the Red Guards. After this incident, Zhou attempted to create a more peaceful code of conduct for the Red Guards, with the support of cadres Tao Zhu, Li Fuchuan, and Chen Yi. This plan was foiled by the ultra-leftists Kang Sheng, Jiang Qing, and Zhang Chunqiao. Although many of Zhou&#x27;s other initiatives to stem the destruction failed because of their or Mao&#x27;s own opposition, he did succeed in preventing Beijing from being renamed &quot;East Is Red City&quot; and the Chinese guardian lions in front of Tian&#x27;anmen Square from being replaced with statues of Mao.

In later stages of the campaign, examples of Chinese architecture were destroyed, classical literature and Chinese paintings were torn apart, and Chinese temples were desecrated.

=== Personal harassment and private properties ===
Other manifestations of the Red Guard campaign included giving speeches, posting big-character posters, and harassment of people, such as intellectuals, who defiantly demonstrated the Four Olds. This escalated from accosting people in the streets due to their dress or hairstyle, to widespread murder, assault, arbitrary detention and the ransacking of private homes. Red Guards broke into the homes of the wealthy and destroyed paintings, books, and furniture; all were items that they viewed as part of the Four Olds.

Many artists and other cultural professionals were persecuted by vigilantes, although some cultural advances came about because of the period, including the integration of &quot;new&quot; western instruments and ballet into Peking opera.

=== Attacks on ethnic minorities and book burnings ===
Languages and customs of ethnic minorities in China were labeled as part of the Four Olds and texts in ethnic languages were burned. Bilingual education was suppressed.

==Aftermath==

=== Appraisal of damage ===
No official statistics have ever been produced by the Communist party in terms of reporting the actual cost of damage. By 1978, many stories of death and destruction caused by the Cultural Revolution had leaked out of China and became known worldwide.

=== Preservation ===
During and after the Cultural Revolution, efforts were made to protect Chinese cultural artifacts. Shanghai officials intervened in Red Guard house searches, relocating items to safety and documenting those that couldn&#x27;t be moved for future restoration. Post-Cultural Revolution, there was a renewed effort to preserve cultural heritage, with initiatives like the Lost Cultural Relics Recovery Program and the establishment of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage to protect and manage historical sites and artifacts.

<text>Blade Warrior is a beat &#x27;em up video game, released in 1991 by Image Works for Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS. The game was created by Jason Kingsley.

==Gameplay==
The game is a mix of adventuring and battling, in which players are tasked with collecting magical items and exploring the landscape of the game via the in-game map while fighting off enemies. Various facilities in the game are accessible only when a certain number of artifacts have been collected. A notable feature of &quot;Blade Warrior&quot; is the graphical interface: all objects in the game are seen in silhouette, except for obtainable items, and the effects of magic spells. The background is made up of a night sky, with clouds and hills, etc.

==Plot==
The world has been enslaved by Murk, and players are challenged to free it by collecting the seven fragments of a tablet which are in the possession of seven wizards who inhabit seven towers.

<doc id="450230" wikidata="Q503312" url="?curid=450230" title="Hösbach">
<text>Hösbach is a market community and municipality in the Aschaffenburg district in the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Lower Franconia (&quot;Unterfranken&quot;) in Bavaria, Germany. As of 2023, It has a population of 13,323.

==Geography==

===Location===
The municipality lies in the part of the &quot;Mittelgebirge&quot; Spessart known as &quot;Vorspessart&quot;, 5 km from Aschaffenburg, roughly 70 km from Würzburg and roughly 50 km from Frankfurt am Main. The Hösbach, from which the community&#x27;s name is derived, flows into the Aschaff in the municipal territory.

The central village of Hösbach is located in the valley of the Aschaff, next to the Bundesautobahn 3. However, the outlying centres are located in side valleys and, in the case of Feldkahl and Rottenberg, actually in another watershed, that of the Kahl.

===Constituent communities===
Hösbach has ten &quot;Ortsteile&quot; located on five &quot;Gemarkungen&quot; (traditional cadastral areas). These are as follows (population numbers for 2011): 
* (1,086)
* Hösbach (6,556)
** (1,096)
* (1,661)
* (982)
** Münchhof
* (1,969)
** Aschaffsteg
** Forsthaus
** Schmerlenbach

===Neighbouring communities===
Hösbach borders on (from the north, clockwise): Mömbris, Blankenbach, Sailauf, Bessenbach, Haibach, Aschaffenburg, Goldbach and Johannesberg.

==History==
In 1189, Hösbach had its first documentary mention as &quot;Hostebach&quot;: a &quot;Hermann de Hostebach&quot; and his son Conrad were named in a document from Archbishop Konrad of Mainz as witnesses. In 1218 the &quot;Schmerlenbach&quot; convent (in today&#x27;s constituent community of Winzenhohl) was endowed by the family von Kugelberg and it was granted the right of patronage over the Hösbach church. In the 13th century, the noble family of Hostebach died out, but the name Hösbach remained. Beginning in the 14th century, &quot;Forsthuben&quot; – a kind of woodland estate – were set up in Hösbach, which over the course of time further grew into large farms.

In 1781 there were only 120 houses with 591 inhabitants. These figures rose only very slowly over the following decades. Only in 1895 did the population figure surpass 2,000. In the years thereafter, Hösbach&#x27;s growth came about more quickly through industrialization, especially in nearby Aschaffenburg, so that in 1905 there were already 2,518 people registered in the community, and by 1933 this had reached 3,388. War refugees during and after the Second World War swelled the population to 4,517 by 1946. Steady growth continued for many years.

Through municipal reforms in 1972 and 1978 the community of Hösbach expanded its land area by 1 981 ha and its population by 4,500. At this time, the formerly self-administering small communities of Wenighösbach (1 January 1972), Feldkahl (1 July 1972), Rottenberg (1 May 1978) and Winzenhohl (1 May 1978) were amalgamated.

In the 1980s, Hösbach gained fame as the founding place of the rock band &quot;Böhse Onkelz&quot;.

On the occasion of its 800-year jubilee, Hösbach was awarded the status of &quot;Markt&quot; (market community) on 29 September 1989.

==Governance==
===Community council===

The council is made up of 25 council members, counting the mayor.

(as at municipal election held on 2 March 2008)

===Coat of arms===
The community&#x27;s arms might be described thus: Party per pale gules a churchtower argent, argent a spur vert palewise above which an oak leaf of the third on whose stem bendwise an acorn Or.

Hösbach&#x27;s landmark, with its characteristic tower, is Saint Michael&#x27;s parish church. The tower was included as a charge in the arms on the community&#x27;s wishes, although in heraldically simplified form. The tinctures argent and gules (silver and red) refer to the community&#x27;s former allegiance to the Archbishopric of Mainz. The Archiepiscopal forest officials, who oversaw things in the Spessart region on horseback, had their seat in Hösbach. The existence of this seat in Hösbach can be confirmed from the 14th century onwards. The charges on the escutcheon&#x27;s sinister (armsbearer&#x27;s left, viewer&#x27;s right) side are attributes of this service, with the oak leaf and acorn representing the forest, and the spur the mounted officials themselves.

The arms have been borne since 1970.

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===

Besides its location right next to the major highway A3 (which between Goldbach and Hösbach has been hidden under a Noise barrier to reduce noise pollution), Hösbach is also located on the Bundesstrasse 26. Moreover, the municipal territory is also crossed by the Main–Spessart railway with a station at Hösbach-Bahnhof.

Hösbach is seat of the school centre of the Aschaffenburg district, which comprises the following, nearby schools:
* Astrid-Lindgren-Grundschule primary school
