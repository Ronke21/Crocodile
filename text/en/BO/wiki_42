<text>The Aleutian tern (Onychoprion aleuticus) is a migratory bird living in the subarctic region of the globe most of the year. It is frequently associated with the Arctic tern, which it closely resembles. While both species have a black cap, the Aleutian tern may be distinguished by its white forehead (although juvenile Arctic terns also have white foreheads). During breeding season, the Arctic terns have bright red bills, feet, and legs while those of the Aleutian terns are black.

&quot;Onychoprion aleuticus&quot; has not been thoroughly studied yet. If its winter migratory range was completely unknown until the late 1980s; it is now known that many Aleutian terns spend the winter near the Equator in the western Pacific. The Aleutian tern breeds in wide-ranging coastal colonies only in Alaska and eastern Siberia. Although Alaskan and Siberian populations are not well monitored, both are thought to be in significant decline.

== Taxonomy ==
The Aleutian tern, &quot;Onychoprion aleuticus&quot; (Baird, 1869) is a bird in the family Laridae, a family of seabirds in the order Charadriiformes that includes the gulls, terns and skimmers. The generic name is from Ancient Greek &quot;onux&quot;, &quot;claw&quot; or &quot;nail&quot;, and &quot;prion&quot;, &quot;saw&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;aleuticus&quot; refers to the Aleutian Islands.

It was formerly named &quot;Sterna aleutica.&quot;. Indeed, in his 1758 &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, Linnaeus placed the terns in the genus &quot;Sterna&quot;. However, a phylogenetic analysis found that the species in the &quot;Onychoprion&quot; clade, which includes &quot;O. aleuticus&quot;, &quot;O. fuscatus&quot; (Sooty tern), and &quot;O. anaethetus&quot; (Bridled tern), are related only distantly to the &quot;typical&quot; terns retained in a much-restricted &quot;Sterna&quot;. Still, in broader terms the genera &quot;Onychoprion&quot; and &quot;Sterna&quot; are sisters. Relationships between various tern species, and between the terns and the other Charadriiformes, were formerly difficult to resolve because of a poor fossil record and the misidentification of some finds.

== Description ==
The Aleutian tern is medium-sized tern ( long), with a wingspan, a short pointed bill and a long, deeply forked tail. It weighs 84–140 g (2.9–5.0 oz).

=== Plumage ===
Breeding adult and juvenile are the only plumages likely to be encountered in North America. Breeding adult (definitive alternate plumage) has a white forehead, a black cap, a mid-grey mantle with darkish grey underparts, and white rump and tail. Its underwing is whitish, with dark-tipped primaries and a diagnostic dark bar on the secondaries. The Aleutian tern has a black bill as well as black legs. There are no significant differences between the male and the female.

The plumage of the non-breeding adult (definitive basic plumage) is poorly known. It is thought to be similar to plumage of the breeding adult. It has white underparts, a white speckled crown, and a gray tail with white sides. Whereas the forehead bar disappears in winter, the dark secondary bar remains.

Lee described juveniles with a white collar, extensive white forehead, white underparts, and gray tail with white outer web of outer tail-feather. They usually do not have clear dark bar on their secondaries.

Molt strategies are very poorly known in the Aleutian tern but are presumably similar to those of other medium-sized, northern-breeding, migratory terns, such as the much better-studied common tern. The Aleutian tern exhibits a Complex Alternate Strategy:
=== Voice ===
The Aleutian tern is associated with different calls reported in the literature. Their call can be distinguished from the Common tern ones, since it has a higher pitch and is characterized by a soft and rolling whistled tone.

The most distinctive sound is the choppy &quot;chif-chif-chu-ak&quot; described by Olsen and Larsson in 1995, less harsh than the sustained note of the Arctic tern. Another distinctive sound of the Aleutian tern is a prolonged &quot;whee-hee-hee-hee&quot; stressed on the first syllable. Aleutian terns also have a call that is similar to call of Red-necked Phalarope (&quot;Phalaropus lobatus&quot;), which is a short, sharp &quot;chit&quot; &quot;,&quot; possibly uttered during social contact.

The Aleutian tern is generally silent while incubating.

== Distribution and habitat ==

During breeding season, the colonies gather along Pacific coastlines of Alaska and Russia. More precisely, breeding colonies have been located along the coast of Chukchi Sea (western Alaska), on the Seward Peninsula and Yukon-Kuskokwim River Delta along the Alaska Peninsula, in the Aleutian Island, in the Kodiak Archipelago, on the Kenai Peninsula and Copper River delta, and along the Gulf of Alaska. The current worldwide minimum breeding population has been estimated at 31 000 birds, with most colonies occurring in the Siberian region of Russia (25 602 birds in 89 colonies) and the remaining 18% occurring in Alaska (5 529 birds in 111 colonies). However, within the last decade, there have been reports of colony declines and disappearances at individual sites in Alaska.

This species is strongly migratory, and although the wintering range is poorly known, it is believed to lie off Indonesia and Malaysia. Small flocks of the species have been increasingly sighted in coastal areas around Hong Kong in spring and fall, around Singapore and Indonesia between October and April, and in coastal waters of Java, Bali and Sulawesi during December. The regular appearance of Aleutian terns in fall off Hong Kong suggests one possible route for southbound migrants. The Aleutian tern stands out from its congeners because it is the only species to show an annual migratory behaviour between a subarctic breeding zone and tropical wintering areas in the South Pacific. Only a very small number of Charadriiformes breeding in Alaska appear to have a connection to East Asia. In December 2017, they were spotted for the first time on Australia&#x27;s eastern coast.

=== Habitat ===
The Aleutian tern usually lives in partially vegetated sandy beaches and grassy meadows, mossy boglands and marshes, either on isolated rocky islands or along coasts, often near river mouths. The Aleutian tern is pelagic when it is not breeding.

=== Status ===
Trends in the Aleutian tern distribution indicates that overall, the species seems to undergo rapid declines over generations. Indeed, the numbers at known colonies in Alaska have declined 8.1% annually since 1960, which corresponds to 92.9% over three generations, with large colonies experiencing greater declines than small colonies. The Aleutian tern has therefore been listed as a &quot;Vulnerable&quot; species. Precise factors of declines are unclear but likely include habitat modification, predation, egg harvesting and human disturbance. Moreover, wintering area in Southeast Asia could be related to breeding population declines because this region undergoes several ecological stresses from unregulated fishing, coastal development, and pollution. Aleutian terns are very sensitive to disturbance at colonies and may seasonally or even permanently abandon their colonies in response to human disturbance.

=== Conservation ===
The Aleutian tern has been designated as a species of concern by several agencies and NGOs (Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Audubon Alaska, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, The North American Waterbird Conservation Plan). In 2007, an Aleutian tern Working Group was organized in Alaska in order to examine the necessity to develop an accurate population estimation method and therefore prioritizing the management of the species and the identification of its migration pathway. In 2010, they began to deploy geolocators on Aleutians terns from colonies in Alaska. The lack of data on breeding biology and ecological behaviours limits the development of conservation actions for the species. Further research should focus on the monitoring of populations and colonies in Alaska, Russia and South Pacific regions and the understanding of the main causes of the recent decline of the species.

== Behaviour ==

=== Breeding and Parental Behaviour ===
Aleutian terns breed in colonies, and are site-faithful if their habitat is sufficiently stable. Pairs form on the breeding area, shortly after arrival. The pairs build the nest during the last half of May and first half of June, shortly before egg-laying. The typical clutch size is 2 eggs (occasionally 1 or 3). The nest is a shallow depression usually built on low vegetation such as mosses, lichens, field horsetail, cottongrass, hairgrass or coastal bluegrass. Both parents incubate the eggs and feed the chicks, although the female does more incubating and less fishing than her partner. Aleutian terns are reported to spend less time brooding chicks than do Arctic terns; consequently, Aleutian tern mortality rate is higher during the chick stage.

The eggs typically have an elongate ovate shape and range from length. Their color ranges from a clay/olive green to a honey yellow, they tend to be darker than eggs of other terns. Distinctive large and smaller black spots are irregularly marked over the egg. After a three-week incubation period, the eggs hatch from early June until late July. Several days after hatching, young birds move to taller vegetation before moving with adults to staging areas along coast (semiprecocial juvenils). After 4–5 weeks, the chicks start fledging.

Aleutian terns are easily disturbed from nests. As soon as an intrusion is detected, the adults fly off the nest. They are much slower at returning to nests after being disturbed than are Arctic terns, taking up to 30 min to return. It sometimes nests among Arctic terns, which, like most white terns, are fiercely defensive of their nest and young and will attack large predators. The Aleutian tern, however, is not aggressive in defence of its nests or young.

=== Courtship ===
The courtship display of the Aleutian tern has never been thoroughly described, but all terns are thought to display the same strategies of courtship: ceremonial &quot;fish flight,&quot; &quot;low flight,&quot; &quot;high flight,&quot; and ground &quot;parade&quot;.

The Aleutian tern pre-courtship flights have been described in literature. Beginning on May, several terns participate in a synchronous ascending spiral flight, before the beginning of courtship in early June. Pairs do not always copulate at the colony; indeed, Mickelson et al. observed Aleutian terns that were courting on surrounding beaches of the Copper River Delta (Alaska), away from colonies.

=== Diet and Foraging ===
Aleutian terns primarily feed on small fish, but their diet also includes crustaceans, insects and zooplankton. They forage mostly by flying, hovering low over water and swooping down or surface-dipping into the water to take their food from the surface. Only contact- and surface-dipping have been observed, even in places where other species have been seen plunge-diving. Indeed, terns are considered as poor swimmers because of their small webs and short legs. Aleutian terns usually forage in shallow water, including tidal rips, along rivers, and over inshore marine waters. Occasionally adults and fledgling juveniles catch insects by hawking over freshwater ponds. This species can forage in nearshore marine waters up to offshore from Seward Peninsula, and up to offshore from other colonies. Individuals occasionally attempt to steal fish from other adults bringing fish to chicks. Aleutian terns are skilled flyers and can take insects out of the air while flying.

=== Flight ===
Aleutian terns fly very gracefully; their flight is strong and undeviating, and their wing beats are slower than those of Arctic and Common terns. They mostly fly above the ocean rather than above mainland. Similarly to other terns species, the Aleutian tern walks relatively slowly because of its short legs.

=== Social behaviour ===
Aleutian terns are highly social. Usually, their nests are settled within loose mixed-species colonies. Monospecific colonies or isolated pairs are rare. Colony size usually ranges from 4–150 pairs, but up to 700 pairs on Sakhalin Island (Siberia). The Aleutian terns frequently nests with Arctic Terns in Alaska and Common Terns in Siberia. It also happens that colonies of Mew Gull (&quot;Larus canus&quot;) are close to the Aleutian tern nests.

Less aggressive than Arctic terns; &quot;Onychoprion aleuticus&quot; is frequently chased at colonies and often excluded from mixed-species foraging areas by Arctic terns. The latter can also jeopardize the Aleutian tern foraging activity by stealing its food.

== Predators and parasites ==
Eggs and chicks of the Aleutian tern have been reported to be preyed on by the following list of predators: 
* Arctic fox (&quot;Vulpes lagopus&quot;),
* Coyote (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), 
* Dog (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;), 
* North American river otter (&quot;Lontra canadensis&quot;), 
* Weasel (&quot;Mustela&quot; spp.), 
* Brown bear (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;), 
* Brown rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;), 
* Bald eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;), 
* Parasitic jaeger (&quot;Stercorarius parasiticus&quot;), 
* Glaucous-winged gull (&quot;Larus glaucescens&quot;), 
* Short-eared owl (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;), 
* Black-billed magpie (&quot;Pica pica&quot;), 
* Northwestern crow (&quot;Corvus caurinus&quot;), 
* Common raven (&quot;Corvus corax)&quot;.

If Aleutian terns frequently fly high over the colony when disturbed by humans, they can nonetheless aggressively chase avian predators (but not as aggressively as Arctic terns do). Some chicks may also be killed by Arctic terns; however, breeding success in the species is lower in the absence of Arctic terns as they often rely on their aggressivity to chase potential predators from the colony.

<doc id="454244" wikidata="Q152029" url="?curid=454244" title="Orange Line (MBTA)">
<text>The Orange Line is a rapid transit line operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) as part of the MBTA subway system. The line runs south on the surface from Oak Grove station in Malden, Massachusetts through Malden and Medford, paralleling the Haverhill Line, then crosses the Mystic River on a bridge into Somerville, then into Charlestown. It passes under the Charles River and runs through Downtown Boston in the Washington Street Tunnel. The line returns to the surface in the South End, then follows the Southwest Corridor southwest in a cut through Roxbury and Jamaica Plain to Forest Hills station.

The Orange Line operates during normal MBTA service hours (all times except late nights) with six-car trains. It uses a 152-car CRRC fleet built in 2018–2024. The Orange Line is fully grade-separated and trains are driven by operators with automatic train control for safety. Wellington Carhouse in Medford is used for heavy maintenance and storage; a small yard at Forest Hills is also used for storage. All 20 Orange Line stations are fully accessible. Averaging 105,000 weekday passengers in 2023, the Orange Line has the second-highest ridership of the MBTA subway lines.

The Orange Line originated as the Main Line Elevated of the Boston Elevated Railway, which was built in 1901. It consisted of the Charlestown Elevated, Atlantic Avenue Elevated, Washington Street Elevated, and a portion of the previously built Tremont Street subway. All of the original route has been replaced, beginning with the Washington Street Tunnel replacing the Tremont Street subway in 1908. The Washington Street Elevated was extended from to Forest Hills in 1909, with an infill station at in 1912; the Charlestown Elevated was extended from to in 1919. The Atlantic Avenue Elevated was closed in 1938.

The newly formed MBTA assigned colors to its subway lines in 1965, with the Main Line becoming the Orange Line. The Charlestown Elevated was closed in 1975; it was replaced by the Haymarket North Extension, which opened in phases from 1975 to 1977. The Southwest Corridor replaced the Washington Street Elevated in 1987, using an alignment originally intended for Interstate 95, completing the modern Orange Line alignment. The downtown stations were lengthened in the 1980s to allow six-car trains. Accessibility modifications began with some of those stations and were completed in 2005. opened as an infill station in 2014.

The Orange Line struggled with reliability issues, including aging infrastructure and trains, throughout the 2010s and into the 2020s. Several prominent incidents occurred in 2022 alone, despite the then-underway fleet replacement. Accelerated repairs took place across the entire Orange Line from August 19 to September 18, 2022, and again across different segments of the line throughout 2024.

==History==
===Construction===

The Main Line of the electric Boston Elevated Railway opened in segments, starting in 1901. It proceeded from Sullivan Square along the Charlestown Elevated to the Canal Street incline near North Station. It was carried underground by the Tremont Street subway (now part of the Green Line), returning above ground at the Pleasant Street incline (now closed, located just south of Boylston station). A temporary link connected from there to the Washington Street Elevated, which in 1901 ran from this point via Washington Street to Dudley Square (which is most of what is now Phase 1 of the Silver Line).

Also in 1901, the Atlantic Avenue Elevated opened, branching at Causeway Street to provide an alternate route through downtown Boston (along the shoreline, where today there is no rail transit) to the Washington Street Elevated.

In 1908, a new Washington Street Tunnel opened, allowing Main Line service to travel from the Charlestown Elevated, underground via an additional new portal at the Canal Street incline, under downtown Boston and back up again to meet the Washington Street Elevated and Atlantic Avenue Elevated near Chinatown. The stations were richly decorated with tile work, mosaics, and copper; after criticism of the large Tremont Street subway headhouses, most entrances were comparatively modest and set into buildings. Use of the parallel Tremont Street subway was returned exclusively to streetcars.

By 1909, the Washington Street Elevated had been extended south to . Trains from Washington Street were routed through the new subway, either all the way to Sullivan Square, or back around in a loop via the subway and then the Atlantic Avenue Elevated.

In 1919, the same year that the Atlantic Avenue Elevated was partially damaged in Boston&#x27;s Great Molasses Flood, the Charlestown Elevated was extended north from Sullivan Square to Everett station, over surface right-of-way parallel to Alford Street/Broadway, with a drawbridge over the Mystic River. The Boston Elevated had long-term plans to continue this extension further north to Malden, a goal which would only be achieved decades later, under public ownership and not via the Everett route.

===Closure of Atlantic Avenue Elevated and ownership changes===

Following a 1928 accident at a tight curve on Beach Street, the southern portion of the Atlantic Avenue Elevated, between South Station and Tower D on Washington Street, was closed (except for rush-hour trips from Dudley to North Station via the Elevated), breaking the loop; non-rush-hour Atlantic Avenue service was reduced to a shuttle between North and South Stations. In 1938, the remainder of the Atlantic Avenue Elevated was closed, leaving the subway as the only route through downtown – what is now the Orange Line between and stations.

Ownership of the railway was transferred from the private Boston Elevated Railway to the public Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) in 1947; the MTA was itself reconstituted as the modern Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) in 1964.

On December 5, 1960, the MTA began operating &quot;modified express service&quot; on the line during the morning rush hour. Every other train bypassed Green Street, Egleston (southbound) or Northampton (northbound), Dover, and Thompson Square stations. This was discontinued in September 1961 to reduce wait times at the skipped stations, all of which were outdoors.

===Orange Line naming===

The line was known as the Main Line Elevated under the Boston Elevated Railway, and the Forest Hills–Everett Elevated (Route 2 on maps) under the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

After taking over operations in August 1964, the MBTA began rebranding many elements of Boston&#x27;s public transportation network. Colors were assigned to the rail lines on August 26, 1965, as part of a wider modernization developed by Cambridge Seven Associates. Peter Chermayeff assigned red, green, and blue to the other three lines based on geographic features; however, according to Chermayeff, the Main Line El &quot;ended up being orange for no particular reason beyond color balance.&quot; The firm originally planned for yellow instead of orange, but yellow was rejected after testing because yellow text was difficult to read on a white background. (Yellow was later used for MBTA bus service). The MBTA and transit historians later claimed that orange came from Orange Street, an early name for what is now part of Washington Street.

In January and February 1967, the four original Washington Street Tunnel stations were renamed. Transfer stations were given the same name for all lines: Winter and Summer stations plus Washington on the Red Line became Washington, Milk and State plus Devonshire on the Blue Line became after the cross street, and Union and Friend plus Haymarket Square on the Green Line became after Haymarket Square. Boylston Street was renamed Essex to avoid confusion with nearby Boylston station on the Green Line.

In May 1987, Essex was renamed after the adjacent Chinatown neighborhood, and Washington renamed after the adjacent shopping district. In March 2010, New England Medical Center station was renamed as two years after the eponymous hospital changed its name.

===Rerouting of Charlestown and Everett service===

The Boston Transportation Planning Review looked at the line in the 1970s, considering extensions to reach the Route 128 beltway, with termini at Reading in the north and Dedham in the south. As a result of this review, the Charlestown Elevated – which served the Charlestown neighborhood north of downtown Boston and the inner suburb of Everett – was demolished and replaced in 1975.

The Haymarket North Extension rerouted the Orange Line through an underwater crossing of the Charles River. Service in Charlestown was replaced with service along Boston and Maine tracks routed partially beneath an elevated section of Interstate 93, ultimately to and then to in Malden, Massachusetts, instead of Everett. Rail service to Everett was replaced with buses.

The extension was unique among Boston transit lines as it contained a third express track between Wellington and Community College stations. These stations, along with Sullivan Sq, have two island platform stations as opposed to the more normal single island stations found on the southern side of the Orange Line. This express track was designed for the never-built extension north of Oak Grove to Reading. The third track would have allowed peak-direction express service as well as places to terminate trains. Service north of Oak Grove was planned to have longer headways to account for the lower projected ridership. This extension was opposed by residents of Melrose who preferred restored commuter rail service. Because of this, the express track ends at Wellington and a single commuter rail track continues parallel to the Orange Line north to Reading.

===Closure of Washington Street Elevated===

Construction of Interstate 95 into downtown Boston was cancelled in 1972 after local protest over the necessary demolition. However, land for I-95&#x27;s Southwest Corridor through Roxbury had already been cleared of buildings; moreover, the state had already committed to using this vacant land for transportation purposes. As a result, instead of an 8-lane Interstate highway with a relocated Orange Line running in its median (in a manner similar to the Chicago Transit Authority&#x27;s Dan Ryan, Congress, and O&#x27;Hare branches), the space would be occupied by the realigned Orange Line, a reconstructed three-track mainline for Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor and MBTA Commuter Rail trains, and a linear park. After this re-routing was accomplished in 1987, the Washington Street Elevated was torn down, the last major segment of the original elevated line to be demolished.
Between April 30 and May 3, 1987, the Washington Street Elevated south of the Chinatown station was closed to allow the Orange Line to be tied into the new Southwest Corridor. On May 4, 1987, the Orange Line was rerouted from the southern end of the Washington Street Tunnel onto the new Southwest Corridor. Instead of rising up to elevated tracks, it now veered west at the Massachusetts Turnpike and followed the Pike and the old Boston and Albany Railroad right-of-way to the existing MBTA Commuter Rail stop at . It then continued along new tracks, partially covered and partially open but depressed, to . This MBTA right-of-way is also shared by Amtrak as part of the national Northeast Corridor intercity passenger rail service.
While ending more or less at the same terminus (Forest Hills), the new routing passes significantly to the west of its previous route on Washington Street; local residents were promised &quot;equal or better&quot; replacement service. Originally, plans provided for light rail vehicles street running in mixed traffic, from Washington Street to Dudley Square, then diverting southeastward on Warren Street towards Dorchester. In 2002, Phase 1 of the Silver Line bus rapid transit was added to connect Washington Street to the downtown subways, attempting to address this service need. This replacement service was controversial, as many residents preferred the return of rail transportation.

===Station renovations===
In the mid-1980s, the MBTA spent $80 million to extend the platforms of seven Red Line and three Orange Line stations (, Washington, and ) to allow the use of six-car trains. Washington and State were made fully accessible, as was the northbound platform at Essex. The Southwest Corridor station opened in 1987 were all fully accessible. Six-car trains entered service on August 18, 1987. was also renovated around 1987.

This left only , five stations on the Haymarket North Extension, and the southbound platform at Chinatown inaccessible by the 1990 passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Construction at and began in 1991. was retrofitted with elevators in 2000. The 1975-built was expanded into a &quot;superstation&quot; with a cross-platform transfer to the Green Line; elevators were in installed in 2001, though the Green Line did not use the station until 2004. The southbound platform at Chinatown was made accessible in 2002. Renovations to and were completed in 2005, making the Orange Line the first of the four original MBTA subway lines to become fully accessible.
===Assembly===
In the early 2000s, Somerville began planning an infill station between and to serve the new Assembly Square development. The $57 million station was funded by the state&#x27;s Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development, FTA Section 5309 New Starts program, and Federal Realty Investment Trust (the developer of Assembly Square). Construction began in late 2011 and finished in mid 2014. The new station, , opened on September 2, 2014. It was the first new station on the MBTA subway system since 1987.

===Reliability issues and repairs===
During the unusually brutal winter of 2014–2015, the entire MBTA system was shut down on several occasions by heavy snowfalls. The aboveground sections of the Orange and Red lines were particularly vulnerable due to their exposed third rail, which iced over during storms. When a single train stopped due to power loss, other trains soon stopped as well; without continually running trains pushing snow off the rails, the lines were quickly covered in snow. (Because the Blue Line was built with overhead lines on its surface section due to its proximity to corrosive salt air, it was not subject to icing issues.)

Starting in 2015, the MBTA began implementing its $83.7 million Winter Resiliency Program, much of which focused on preventing similar issues with the Orange and Red lines. The Southwest Corridor section of the Orange Line is located in a trench and is protected from the worst weather, but the 1970s-built Haymarket North Extension had older infrastructure and was in worse shape. From north, it is exposed to the weather and largely built on an embankment, rendering it more vulnerable. That section is receiving new heated third rail, switch heaters, and snow fences to reduce the impacts of inclement weather. The work requires bustitution of the line from Sullivan Square to Oak Grove on certain weeknights and weekends.

In October 2018, the MBTA awarded a $218 million signal contract for the Red and Orange Lines, which was planned to allow 4.5-minute headways on the Orange Line beginning in 2022.

On July 22, 2022, an Orange Line train caught fire while crossing the Mystic River. A metal sill along the underside of the train came loose and came into contact with the third rail, igniting sparks. Passengers had to jump out of the train onto the tracks, and one woman jumped into the river below and swam to shore. There were no injuries or casualties.

Following various reliability issues on the Orange Line, the MBTA announced that it would close the entire line for renovations from August 19 to September 18, 2022. During the closure, the MBTA conducted accelerated repairs to track, ties, signals, and concrete walls, as well as replacing two crossovers. This was intended to remove speed restrictions and improve safety and reliability. The shutdown also gave time for more new CRRC cars to be delivered and put into service; after the closure, service on the line resumed with new trains almost all the time. However, the work was not enough to eliminate all slow zones, and temporary slow zones were added where work was performed. By early October, a round trip on the full line was 13 minutes slower than before the shutdown, and 20 minutes slower than it would be without any slow zones. On October 25, the MBTA sent a letter to Senator Ed Markey, who had been investigating the project, detailing work needed during November and December to lift remaining slow zones, ranging from always-planned to unexpectedly necessary tasks.

In early November 2023, MBTA General Manager Phillip Eng announced an ambitious plan to eliminate all 191 slow zones across the MBTA subway system by the end of 2024. Under this plan, the first of several intermittent shutdowns of different segments of the Orange Line began on March 18, 2024, with more shutdowns taking place that June and October. All slow zones on the Orange Line were finally removed by early November 2024. , the MBTA plans to increase maximum speeds north of Assembly to .

==Rolling stock==

The Orange Line is standard-gauge heavy rail and uses a third rail for power. The newer cars are being built by CRRC in a newly constructed plant in Springfield, Massachusetts, with 152 cars on order, along with additional cars for the Red Line. All in-service Orange Line trains run in six-car consists. Cars of the fleet are 65 feet (20 m) long and 9 ft 3 in (2.8 m) wide, with three pairs of doors on each side.

, weekday peak and afternoon service was scheduled to operate on 8-minute headways, with headways ranging from 8 to 12 minutes at other times. Vehicle utilization ranged between 8 trains (48 cars) and 13 trains (78 cars). However, rolling stock availability and longer trip times due to slow zones reduced service. By July 2023, headways were 10–12 minutes on weekdays. This was improved to nine-minute headways on August 27, 2023.

=== Former rolling stock ===

The &quot;T&quot; previously had a fleet of Pullman-Standard heavy rail cars for the Orange Line. These cars, known as 01100s, had been in service since the 1950s, and saw service on both the elevated and the northern extension before they were retired in 1981. Several remained on the property as Red Line work cars for some time before being scrapped. Units 01178-01179 are preserved at the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine.

From 1981 to 2022, the Orange Line used a fleet of Hawker-Siddeley heavy rail cars. These cars, nicknamed Orange Blossoms, featured reinforced roofs for pantographs. It was thought that if the Orange Line was extended, they would opt to use overhead collection. But since these extensions were never built, pantographs were never installed. The 01200s, along with the Blue Line&#x27;s 0600 cars manufactured at the same time, were based on the designs of the PATH PA3. After 41 years of service, the last 01200s ran on August 19, 2022, before the shutdown, and began to be sent to scrap on September 22, 2022. All were processed by the contractor Costello to remove hazardous materials and be recycled; two were offered to the Seashore Trolley Museum, but the offer was not accepted. The last pair, units 01280-01281, were hauled away on July 17, 2024.

===New CRRC trains===
In late 2008, the MBTA began the planning process for new Orange and Red Line vehicles. The agency originally planned for a simultaneous order for 146 Orange Line cars (to replace the whole fleet) and 74 Red Line cars (to replace the older 1500 and 1600 series cars). A similar order was used in the late 1970s for the current Orange Line cars and the old Blue Line cars, ordered at the same time and largely identical except for size and color. In October 2013, MassDOT announced plans for a $1.3 billion subway car order for the Orange and Red Lines, which would provide 152 new Orange Line cars to replace the existing 120-car fleet and add more frequent service.

On October 22, 2014, the MassDOT Board awarded a $566.6 million contract to a China based manufacturer CNR (which became part of CRRC the following year) to build 152 replacement railcars for the Orange Line, as well as additional cars for the Red Line. The other bidders were Bombardier Transportation, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Hyundai Rotem. CNR began building the cars at a new manufacturing plant in Springfield, Massachusetts, with initial deliveries expected in 2018 and all cars in service by 2023. The Board forwent federal funding to allow the contract to specify the cars be built in Massachusetts, to create a local railcar manufacturing industry. In conjunction with the new rolling stock, the remainder of the $1.3 billion allocated for the project would pay for testing, signal improvements and expanded maintenance facilities, as well as other related expenses. Sixty percent of the car&#x27;s components are sourced from the United States.

After delays due to issues with the train&#x27;s control system, the first new train entered revenue service on August 14, 2019; Replacement of the signal system is expected to be complete by 2022 on the Orange Line; the total cost is $218 million for both the Red and Orange Lines.

While waiting for new cars, service has deteriorated due to maintenance problems with the old cars. The number of trains at rush hour was reduced from 17 (102 cars) to 16 (96 cars) in 2011; in the same year, daily ridership surpassed 200,000. Increased running times – largely due to longer dwell times from increased ridership – resulted in headways being lengthened from 5 minutes before 2011 to 6 minutes in 2016. The increased fleet size with the new trains will allow headways to be reduced to between 4 and 5 minutes at peak. In the interim, a 2016 test of platform markings at North Station which show boarding passengers where to stand to avoid blocking alighting passengers resulted in a one-third decrease in dwell times.

The new cars have faced several issues since their August entry into service. In November 2019, a car derailed while undergoing initial testing at the Wellington yard. The last car of a six car trainset had jumped the rails while going over a switch, however no major damage had been reported. Several months earlier, the first two trainsets were taken out of service due to safety issues following the inadvertent opening of a passenger door while the train was in motion. Cars were also rechecked in early December 2019, after issues with sounds combined with passenger overload necessitated removal from service. The first train was restored to service in January 2020. The trains were pulled again on March 16, 2021, after a derailment involving one of the cars. Buses replaced trains around the site of the derailment until April 12. The CRRC cars remained out of service as of July 2021; defective side bearer pads were identified as a contributing factor. These dampen the movements of the trucks (which include the wheels) with respect to the car bodies, but were found to be wearing in such a way as to produce too much friction. The first of the CRRC trainsets was returned to revenue service on August 20, after modifications were approved by the MBTA&#x27;s Safety Department and the Department of Public Utilities. The new cars were again removed from service on May 19–23, 2022, after a braking issue on one car due to an incorrectly installed bolt, and again between June and July 2022 due to a battery failure. In December 2022, some new cars were removed from service due to failed power cables causing electric arcing on axles.

The CRRC contract requires delivery of all Orange Line cars by January 2022, with a fine of $500 per day per car for late deliveries. Delays began to accumulate in 2019, and then facilities in China and Springfield had to shut down and operate at reduced capacity for parts of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of September 2022, 78 of 152 new cars had been put in service on the Orange Line. This was enough for service almost all the time because of the rush hour service cap introduced after an FTA safety audit identified insufficient staffing of subway dispatchers. The MBTA indicated it would assess which delays were the fault of the contractor at the end of the contract. In 2023, cars were being delivered incomplete with incomplete paint repairs, connectors seen hanging on underframes, and parts sanded down to bare metal. The MBTA and CRRC have collaborated to resolve quality issues. In August 2023, MBTA General Manager has reported that the new Orange Line cars are exhibiting an average of approximately 114,000 miles traveled between failures, which surpasses the contractual requirement of 90,000 miles by over a quarter.

===Facilities===
The Orange Line has two tracks for most of its length; a third track is present between Wellington station and the Charles River portal. This track is used to bypass construction on the other two tracks and for testing newly delivered cars for the Orange Line. The primary maintenance and storage facility is at Wellington station. Had the Orange Line been extended to Reading, the third track would have been the northbound local track, and the present-day northbound track would likely have become a bi-directional express track.

Expansion of the yard and carhouse was needed for the larger CRRC fleet. Yard work was substantially completed in August 2023, while carhouse expansion is expected to be complete in mid-2024.

<text>HD Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (HHI; ) is the world&#x27;s largest shipbuilding company and a major heavy equipment manufacturer. Its headquarters are in Ulsan, South Korea.

==History==


HHI was founded in 1972 by Chung Ju-yung as a division of the Hyundai Group, and in 1974, completed building its first ships. In 2002, the company was spun-off from its parent company. HHI has four core business divisions: Shipbuilding, Offshore &amp; Engineering, Industrial Plant &amp; Engineering, and Engine &amp; Machinery. HHI also has five non-core related subsidiaries: Hyundai Electric &amp; Energy Systems, Hyundai Construction Equipment, Hyundai Robotics, Hyundai Heavy Industries Green Energy, and Hyundai Global Service.

The Hyundai Group started as a small South Korean construction firm in 1947, headed by its founder, Korean entrepreneur Chung Ju-yung. Another widely known and closely related Korean company, the Hyundai Motor Company, was founded in 1967, five years prior to the founding of the Heavy Industry Group. The motor company was also founded by Chung. The company has a partnership with Capital Product Partners to create four specialized ships with equipment for ocean-based carbon capture and storage to be delivered in 2025 and 2026 and at a cost of $300 million.

The name is an informal romanisation of the Korean (&quot;hyeondae&quot;) meaning &quot;contemporary&quot; or &quot;modern&quot;, which was Chung&#x27;s vision for the group of companies that he founded.

On 11 July 2024, Hyundai Heavy Industries became the first Korean shipbuilder to sign a master ship repair agreement (MSRA) with Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP), qualifying to participate in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s MRO business.

<text>Carlie&#x27;s Law was a bill introduced in the United States Congress by Representative Katherine Harris (R-FL), with the support of Nick Lampson (D-TX) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), in response to the kidnapping, rape and murder of 11-year-old Carlie Brucia by Joseph P. Smith in Florida in February 2004. Smith was on probation at the time of Brucia&#x27;s murder, having been released from state prison thirteen months prior.

The amendment to existing law was intended to toughen parole rules for sex offenders and also notify non-custodial parents when there is criminal activity near their child&#x27;s home. Partly for this reason, Joseph Brucia, the child&#x27;s father, approved making the law in her name, although he concedes this law would not have applied to her specific case, since the charges for which Smith was on probation were not the sexual offenses the law would target.

The bill failed to pass before the end of the 2004 session. Harris committed to re-introduce the bill in 2005, but no further information has been made available.

Joseph Smith, age 55, was found dead in prison on July 26, 2021, while awaiting his execution. His cause of death was liver cancer.

==Background==

Carlie Jane Brucia (March 16, 1992 – February 1, 2004) was sexually battered and murdered by Joseph P. Smith (March 17, 1966 – July 26, 2021) after being kidnapped from a car wash near her home in Sarasota, Florida, United States, on February 1, 2004, while returning from a friend&#x27;s house. She was reported missing by her parents within half an hour of her abduction.

The kidnapping case became infamous after a surveillance video showing the girl surfaced. The video, taken from a security camera located behind a car wash, shows Brucia being confronted by a man, later identified as Smith, who then grabbed her arm and led her away toward a car that was spotted on another camera. The video was shown nationwide and spurred a massive manhunt for the abductor.

==Arrest==
On February 6, police announced that Smith, a 37-year-old father of three and car mechanic with a long list of arrests for drug-related charges and one for kidnapping and false imprisonment, was in custody as the primary suspect. In the same announcement, the police confirmed that Smith&#x27;s car was involved in the crime.

The story gained national media attention in large part because Brucia&#x27;s abduction was recorded by a surveillance camera. The tape shows her being approached by a man who seemed to be in his late 20s or early 30s. They apparently had a short conversation, after which he grabbed her by the arm and took her away. The FBI and NASA joined in the efforts to find Brucia and the man seen with her on the videotape. NASA researchers used advanced image processing technology to enhance the recording by reducing image jitter.

At least two informants called police, having recognized Smith from the television broadcasts of the security camera tape. Smith was already in custody at the time, having been arrested on February 3 on an unrelated parole violation. Smith refused to speak with investigators about Brucia&#x27;s abduction until February 5, when he revealed where he had hidden her body, behind a nearby church.

==Trial==
On February 20, Smith was indicted for first-degree murder, and charges of kidnapping and capital sexual battery were also filed by Sarasota County prosecutors. The trial started November 7, 2005 in Sarasota. On November 17, 2005, the jury returned a guilty verdict. On December 1, 2005, the jury, by a vote of 10 to 2, returned a recommendation for the death penalty. On March 15, 2006, Smith was sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment on the charges of capital sexual battery and kidnapping, and to death by lethal injection on the murder charge.

In October 2011, the United States Supreme Court (which had earlier rejected an appeal from Smith in June 2011), ordered that the State of Florida respond to a federal claim filed by Smith saying his right to confront witnesses at trial was violated when prosecutors introduced DNA evidence against him without making available the laboratory technician who actually performed the work. The Court later dismissed the appeal after deciding a related case, &quot;Williams v. Illinois&quot;.

In the aftermath of &quot;Hurst v. Florida&quot;, which required juries in Florida to be unanimous in imposing the death penalty, Smith&#x27;s death sentence was overturned in 2018; however the Florida Supreme Court reinstated his death sentence in April 2020.

Smith died on July 26, 2021, at Union Correctional Institution in Raiford, at the age of 55.

==Dramatization==

The case was featured in the first episode &quot;Come Home Carlie&quot; of the seventh season of Investigation Discovery&#x27;s &quot;See No Evil&quot;, aired in early February 2021.

<text>The yellow-wattled lapwing (Vanellus malabaricus) is a lapwing that is endemic to the Indian Subcontinent. It is found mainly on the dry plains of peninsular India and has a sharp call and is capable of fast flight. Although they do not migrate, they are known to make seasonal movements in response to rains. They are dull grey brown with a black cap, yellow legs and a triangular wattle at the base of the beak. Like other lapwings and plovers, they are ground birds and their nest is a mere collection of tiny pebbles within which their well camouflaged eggs are laid. The chicks are nidifugous, leaving the nest shortly after hatching and following their parents to forage for food.

==Taxonomy==
The yellow-wattled lapwing was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; in 1781. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot;. This plate was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Charadrius malabaricus&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The type locality is the Malabar Coast in southwest India. The current genus &quot;Vanellus&quot; was erected by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. &quot;Vanellus&quot; is Medieval Latin for a &quot;lapwing&quot;. It is a diminutive of the Latin &quot;vanus&quot; meaning &quot;winnowing&quot; or &quot;fan&quot;. The species is monotypic.

== Description ==

These are conspicuous and unmistakable birds found in dry stony and open grassland or scrub habitats. They are medium-sized pale brown waders with a black crown which is separated from the brown on the neck by a narrow white band and large yellow facial wattles. The chin and throat are black and the brown neck and upper breast is separated from the white belly by a narrow blackish line. The tail has a subterminal black band which does not extend into the outer tail-feathers. There is a white wingbar on the inner half of the wing. The bill is yellow at the base. They have tiny yellow carpal spurs. The crown feathers can be raised slightly in displays. They are mostly sedentary but populations make long-distance movements in response to the monsoons. They are occasional visitors to the Kathmandu valley in Nepal and a vagrant was seen in Malaysia.

There are no recognized subspecies, but there is a size increase from south to north. They are 260-280mm long with a wing of 192-211mm, bill 23-26mm, tarsus 57-66mm and tail 71-84mm. Juveniles have a brown crown and the sexes are alike but males have slightly longer wings and tarsi. The call is a sharp &quot;tchee-it&quot; call.

Local names include &#x27; in Hindi, &#x27; in Telugu and &#x27; in Rajasthan and Pakistan, &#x27; in Punjabi, &quot;laori&quot; in Madhya Pradesh, &#x27; or &#x27; in Gujarati, &#x27; in Marathi, &#x27; in Malayalam, &#x27; in Kannada, &#x27; in Tamil and &quot;&quot; in Sinhalese.

== Habitat and distribution ==
This species is common in much of India, being seen in a variety of open lowland habitats. It tends to be seen in drier habitats than the red-wattled lapwing, &quot;Vanellus indicus&quot;. They are found in most parts of India, parts of Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. They make short-distance movements in response to rain but the exact pattern is not known.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

These lapwings breed in the dry season with peak breeding in March to May ahead of the monsoons. The nest territory has been estimated, based on the distance to nearest neighbours, to be about 2.7 acres. They lay four eggs in a ground scrape. A nest in a clump of grass has been noted as exceptional. Parents visit water and wet their breast feathers (&quot;belly soaking&quot;; they may stay for as much as 10 minutes to soak water ) which may then be used to cool the eggs or chicks. The four eggs typically hatch simultaneously, even though they are laid with a difference of a few days. The nidifugous young are well camouflaged as they forage with the parents. Chicks squat flat on the ground and freeze when parents emit an alarm call. A second brood may be raised, particularly when the first fails and young from a previous brood have been seen along with parent birds incubating a second clutch. Simultaneous courtship displays among several pairs in close proximity has been noted. In one study more than 60% of the nests had 4 eggs-clutches with the rest having 3 eggs. Hatching success was found to be about 27.58% and egg loss was due to predation and nest damage. The incubation period was 27–30 days. When the nests are approached, the incubating bird attempts to move away from the nest without drawing attention to it.

The food of the yellow-wattled lapwing is beetles, termites and other invertebrates, which are picked from the ground. The feather mite &quot;Magimelia dolichosikya&quot; has been noted as an ectoparasite of this species.

<text>José de Diego y Martínez (April 16, 1866 – July 16, 1918) was a Puerto Rican statesman, journalist, poet, lawyer, and advocate for Puerto Rico&#x27;s political autonomy in union with Spain and later of Puerto Rican independence from the United States who was referred to by his peers as &quot;The Father of the Puerto Rican Independence Movement&quot;.

==Early years==
De Diego was born in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. He was the son of Felipe de Diego Parajón, a Spanish Army Officer from Asturias, Spain, and Elisa Martínez Muñiz, a native of Puerto Rico. De Diego studied at the Aguadilla Elementary School before being sent to Spain to finish his education at the Instituto Politecnico de Logroño. While in Spain, de Diego attended the University of Barcelona to study law and collaborated with the newspaper El Progreso (Progress), founded by fellow Puerto Rican José Julián Acosta y Blanco, which attacked the political situation in Puerto Rico; this led to various arrests which lead to his being expelled from the University of Barcelona and eventually forced to leave Spain. He then returned to the island of Puerto Rico. Some time after his arrival in Puerto Rico he traveled again to Cuba to continue his studies at the University of La Habana where he completed his degree in law.

==Poetry==
In 1886, de Diego had an unhappy love affair which led him to write &quot;A Laura&quot; (&quot;To Laura&quot;). This poem became very popular among the romantics of that time. He became known as the &quot;Father&quot; of the &quot;Modern Puerto Rican Poetry Movement&quot;. Among his most noted poetry books are:

* &quot;Pomarrosas&quot;
* &quot;Jovillos&quot;
* &quot;Cantos de Rebeldía&quot;
* &quot;Cantos del Pitirre&quot;

==Confederation of the Spanish-speaking islands in the Caribbean==
De Diego returned to Spain and studied law in Barcelona. However, he did not finish his studies there and transferred to the University of Havana in 1891, where he received his degree the following year. He then returned to Puerto Rico to advocate for its autonomy from Spain. The 1876 Spanish Constitution created a centralized state, and ended the ancient system of Autonomies and commonwealth kingdoms. Many in the wealthier regions such as Catalonia, Galicia, the Basque Provinces, Cuba, Philippines and Puerto Rico sought to reinstate it. It coincided with the growth of the republican sentiments. De Diego set up his law practice in Arecibo and was the founder of the newspaper &quot;La República&quot; (&quot;The Republic&quot;). Together with Román Baldorioty de Castro, de Diego founded the Autonomist Party in 1887. Luis Muñoz Rivera and Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, who were members of the party, formed a committee which ultimately convinced the Spanish &quot;Liberal Fusionist&quot; Party leader Práxedes Mateo Sagasta to support the idea of autonomy for Puerto Rico within the Spanish kingdom. De Diego did not accompany Muñoz Rivera and Matienzo Cintrón because he was an antimonarchist: he believed that Spain should be a Federal Republic and Mateo Sagasta&#x27;s party followed the ideals of the monarchy. De Diego envisioned the establishment of a Confederation of the Spanish-speaking islands in the Caribbean which would include the Dominican Republic and Cuba, known as the Antillean Confederation. In 1897, the Spanish Parliament granted the Charter of Autonomy to Puerto Rico, pursuant to Art. 82 of the Constitution of Spain acknowledged, after Mateo Sagasta&#x27;s election as Prime Minister. Puerto Rico became a Spanish Autonomous Province. Muñoz-Rivera became the chief of the autonomous cabinet of the government and Minister or Justice and Grace, De Diego followed Muñoz Rivera&#x27;s accomplishment and was named Vice-Minister of Justice and Grace. Puerto Rico&#x27;s autonomy, however was short-lived, being subsequently invaded by the United States.

==Politician==
José de Diego, together with many republican intellectuals, initially saw the American occupation with a positive attitude. They thought they would become American citizens with the same rights as the citizens in the mainland USA. He even wrote poems on the topic. However, after the American occupation began in October 1898, the racist attitude of the US military made him rethink his ideals. On June 5, 1900, President William McKinley named de Diego, together with Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, José Celso Barbosa, Manuel Camuñas, and Andrés Crosas to an Executive Cabinet under U.S.-appointed Governor Charles H. Allen. The Executive Cabinet also included six American members. De Diego resigned from the position in order to pursue the island&#x27;s right to govern itself. In 1904, he co-founded the Unionist Party along with Luis Muñoz Rivera, Eduardo Georgetti, Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón and Antonio R. Barceló.

De Diego was then elected to the House of Delegates, the only locally elected body of government allowed by the U.S.. De Diego presided the house from 1904 to 1917. The House of Delegates was subject to the U.S. President&#x27;s veto power and voted for the island&#x27;s right to independence and self-government and against the imposition of U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans, among other resolutions passed. None of these requests were honored by newly developing US hemispheric expansionism. In 1914, Barceló, Muñoz Rivera and de Diego were members of an executive council that attempted to form an alliance between the Union and Republican Parties. In 1917, after Luis Muñoz Rivera died, Barceló became the leading force behind the liberal ideas of the island. Barceló and De Diego were against the creation of the Jones-Shafroth Act which would impose United States citizenship upon the citizens of Puerto Rico because the act represented an impediment to Puerto Rican independence as a final status solution and because the judicial and executive branches would still be controlled by the United States. The Jones-Shafroth Act, however was approved by the United States and signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on March 2, 1917. The Union Party under Barceló&#x27;s leadership then resolved to adopt a different stance and to seek more autonomy which he believed would finally lead to independence. This move prompted de Diego&#x27;s, who was a strong independence advocate, to have great differences with the majority of his party members. De Diego became known as the &quot;Father of the Puerto Rican Independence Movement&quot;. He was considered by Puerto Rican Socialist Party founder Juan Marí Bras to be the bridge between the two &quot;great ideological pillar[s] for independence&quot; Ramón Emeterio Betances and Pedro Albizu Campos, in the 19th and 20th Centuries, respectively.

==Later years==
In 1892 he was married to Doña Petra de la Torre Berríos at the Catedral de San Felipe Apóstol, in her hometown of Arecibo. This marriage was later annulled by the Roman Catholic Church. On 10 November 1900 he married Goergina Blanes in Mayagüez, with whom he had three children.

De Diego founded the &quot;Colegio de Agricultura y Artes Mecánicas de Mayagüez&quot; now known as &quot;University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez&quot;.; he travelled throughout the Caribbean and Spain seeking the support from what he called &quot;Los hermanos de la misma raza&quot; (Brothers of the same race) for Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence. After giving a speech in Barcelona in to such a request, he became known as the &quot;Caballero de la Raza&quot; (The Gentleman of the Race). José de Diego&#x27;s left leg developed gangrene, due to him suffering from filariasis (round worms) and was amputated in 1916. He died in New York City on July 16, 1918, of endocarditis. His remains were returned to Puerto Rico and are buried in the &quot;Cementerio Antiguo de San Juan&quot; (Santa Maria Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery), in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

==Legacy==
José de Diego&#x27;s memory has been honored in Puerto Rico by having his birthdate observed as an official holiday as well as the naming of schools, avenues, and a highway after him. The plaza in his hometown of Aguadilla, the &quot;Plaza José de Diego&quot;, is named in his honor plus there are schools in Chicago, Illinois, Brooklyn, New York, and Miami, Florida, named after him.

<doc id="454283" wikidata="Q6823854" url="?curid=454283" title="Methodist local preacher">
<text>A Methodist local preacher is a layperson who has been accredited by the Methodist Church to lead worship and preach on a frequent basis. With separation from the Church of England by the end of the 18th century, a clear distinction was recognised between itinerant preachers (later, ministers) and the local preachers who assisted them. Local preachers have played an important role in Methodism since the earliest days of the movement, and have also been important in English social history. These preachers continue to serve an indispensable role in the Methodist Church of Great Britain, in which the majority of church services are led by laypeople. In certain Methodist connexions, a person becomes a local preacher after obtaining a license to preach. In many parts of Methodism, such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, there are thus two different tiers of ministers—licensed preachers and ordained elders.

==Historical background==
Local preachers have been a characteristic of Methodism from its beginnings as a revival movement in 18th-century England. John Wesley tried to avoid a schism with the Church of England, and encouraged those who attended his revival meetings to attend their parish churches, but they also attended Methodist preaching services which were held elsewhere and met in &quot;classes&quot; (small cell groups). It quickly became necessary to build &quot;preaching houses&quot; where the Methodist meetings could be held. These began to function as alternative churches, often depending on the attitude of the local Anglican clergy.

One such preaching house was The Foundery, which served as Wesley&#x27;s base in London. In about 1740, Wesley was away on business and had left a young man, Thomas Maxfield, in charge of The Foundery. Since no clergymen were available, Maxfield took it upon himself to preach to the congregation. Wesley was annoyed by this and returned to London in order to confront Maxfield. However, his mother, Susanna Wesley, persuaded him to hear Maxfield out, suggesting that he had as much right to preach as Wesley. Wesley was sufficiently impressed by Maxfield&#x27;s preaching to see it as God&#x27;s work and let the matter drop, with Maxfield becoming one of Methodism&#x27;s earliest lay preachers.

Methodism formally broke with the Anglican church as a result of Wesley&#x27;s 1784 ordination of ministers to serve in the United States following the American War of Independence. Before the schism, Wesley had as accredited preachers only a handful of fellow Anglican priests who shared his view of the need to take the gospel to the people where they were. Because of their small number, these priests were necessarily &quot;itinerant&quot;, travelling around the country like Wesley himself. Their travelling pattern, like that used until the mid 20th century by judges, gave rise to the use of the word &quot;circuit&quot; to describe a group of churches overseen by a single minister; this word is still in use today.

Because of the limited number of ordained ministers he could call on, Wesley appointed &quot;local preachers&quot; who were not ordained but whom he examined, and whom he felt he could trust to lead worship and preach: though not to minister sacraments.

As the independent Methodist Church developed following the schism and Wesley&#x27;s death, a pattern was soon established in which ordained ministers, whose number was still limited, were attached for a short period (at first three years, subsequently five, and now more usually seven or more) to a circuit. The circuit minister had pastoral oversight and administered sacraments, but the majority of services were led – and sermons preached – by laypersons. Local preachers would regularly spend a whole day with a local church (called a &quot;Society&quot;), leading one or more services and undertaking pastoral visiting. Many travelled significant distances in the course of a day, often on foot.

In its essentials, this pattern has remained in British Methodism to the present day. Although by the end of the 19th century most circuits were staffed by several ministers, there were almost always more churches in the circuit than ministers, many of them offering two or three services every Sunday. The need for local preachers has never declined and in many circuits an active local preacher may well be involved in preparing and leading worship on seven or eight occasions in a thirteen-week quarter.

==Women as local preachers==
Methodism has always acknowledged and valued the ministry of women, a Wesleyan influence going back to Susanna Wesley herself. In early British Methodism, a number of women served as local preachers (the heroine of George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Adam Bede&quot; is represented as one). Methodism itself was subject to schism giving rise, in England, to several Methodist connexions including the Primitive Methodists and the Bible Christians as well as the majority Wesleyan Methodist Church. The separated denominations went much further than the Wesleyans in making use of women as local preachers and as ordained ministers. In Wesleyan Methodism from 1803, women were restricted to addressing women-only meetings. This restriction meant that women preachers in Wesleyan Methodism found it increasingly difficult to exercise their ministry and even though in 1804 the Wesleyan Conference was very short of male preachers, it would not sanction the use of women. Some women, such as Sarah Mallett, however, ignored this ban. From 1910 the blanket ban was repealed, and from 1918 on, Wesleyan Methodism recruited and deployed women local preachers on exactly the same basis as men. When Methodist Union in England took place in 1932, the ordination of women in the separated denominations ceased until 1971, but the equal status of women as local preachers continued.

==Importance of local preachers in English social history==

Local preachers have always been required to undergo some form of training and examination – the examination being concerned with their doctrinal orthodoxy as well as with their knowledge of Scripture, and the history and doctrines of the church. Because Methodism had great strength among the lower middle classes and skilled working classes in 19th-century England, training as a local preacher was one of the ways in which intelligent people who had little chance of formal schooling acquired education and an ability at public speaking. Although the church as an institution was by no means politically radical, many of its members were, and the discipline and eloquence of Methodist local preachers found a ready use in the developing labour movement of the later 19th century. 

Many of the founders of the trade union movement in Britain were local preachers, including George Loveless, the leader of the Tolpuddle Martyrs. Local preachers continue to be found in the ranks of the Labour movement: prominent recent examples include George Thomas, Speaker of the House of Commons from 1976 to 1983, Len Murray, General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress from 1973 to 1984, David Hallam Member of the European Parliament 1994 to 1999 and, early in his career, David Blunkett, former Home Secretary.

==Discipline, training and accreditation of local preachers today==

Local preachers, together with their colleagues in the ordained ministry (presbyters and deacons), are members of the Local Preachers&#x27; Meeting of the circuit in which their membership is held. The Preachers&#x27; Meeting used to meet quarterly, though in many circuits it is now less often. The Meeting is the body which is responsible for the training and development of local preachers, for their pastoral care in this specific role and also for the discipline (should that be necessary) of its own members. It functions also as a study and fellowship group, and as a focus for continuing development of fully accredited local preachers. The standing of a local preacher, however, is national not local and, for example, is not affected by removal to another church or circuit – though it is always up to the superintendent minister whether any preacher is given any appointments.

Currently, the training for local preachers in Britain consists of a course supported by local tutors, with examination on its content by continuous assessment rather than unseen examination. The course (&quot;Worship: Leading and Preaching&quot;) is organised on a connexional (national) basis, but all other aspects of the training and examination of preachers are dealt with at the local (circuit) level.

Those offering themselves for training first ask for a &quot;note to preach&quot; from the superintendent minister of their circuit which is given at his or her sole discretion and reported to the Preachers&#x27; Meeting. The new preacher is then listed as &quot;On note&quot;, begins a course of study and practical training (which takes between two and five years to complete), and begins to accompany an accredited preacher and share in the leadership of worship.

After some months, provided favourable reports are received at the Circuit Preachers&#x27; Meeting, they then progress to being &quot;on trial&quot;. Local preachers on trial still work at first with an experienced preacher, but in due course they progress to leading worship on their own. The Preachers&#x27; Meeting continues to appoint preachers and other local officers to audit their services, make reports and offer guidance. The meeting carries out an oral doctrinal examination at the beginning of training, at intermediate points, and before the final acceptance of the candidate as an accredited preacher. The candidate must also give an account of their call to preach, and are expected to have knowledge of some of the most important of the &quot;Sermons of the Rev. John Wesley&quot;. Final admission as a local preacher is referred to as being &quot;fully accredited&quot; or &quot;received onto full plan&quot;, the &quot;Circuit Plan&quot; being the schedule of preaching appointments for the circuit. The decision is formally ratified by the Circuit Meeting before it is put into effect. A service of recognition is held, often within the context of a principal act of worship.

Formerly, before changes in 2022, candidates for ordination as a presbyter in the Methodist Church in Great Britain were required to be admitted as local preachers before candidating.

==Local preachers and the liturgy==

Compared to lay people in some other denominations, Methodist local preachers are accorded significant authority over the progress of a service, for which they are seen as having overall responsibility, rather than just delivering the sermon. A local preacher may, at his or her discretion, do a number of different things:

*create the order of service;
*omit or include any part of the order of service;
*determine which Bible readings are to be included, which may – but need not – be selected from those defined in the lectionary;
*involve other people in the preparation and leading of the worship

Increasingly, in British Methodism, local preachers accept guidance from the churches to which they go, for example in regular or seasonal local elements of liturgy, or in using those nominated in a rota of readers or prayer leaders. A relatively recent development is the appointment of Worship Leaders who are members of the local church and authorised to share in the leading of worship there. All preachers and worship leaders are offered additional resources for shaping worship and preaching by their own charity, the Leaders of Worship and Preachers&#x27; Trust (LWPT) which publishes a quarterly journal (&quot;Ichthus&quot;) and has its own website.

==Local preachers worldwide==
The institution of local preachers spread from the original Wesleyan Methodist Church to the other Methodist connexions that developed in Britain; and from Britain to Methodist churches in other countries, particularly those that were founded or supported by the British Methodist Church, such as the churches in India, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean, Fiji, and many countries in Africa. The title of &quot;local preacher&quot; was used historically in several Methodist denominations in North America, and local preachers there had the right to marry and bury people (though not to administer Communion) as well as to lead worship; the role has more or less vanished from America today. Although the modern US-based United Methodist Church recognises an order of &quot;lay speakers&quot;, they do not have the authority or the responsibility for leading worship in the same way as a local preacher in Britain. Within the last decade, the United Methodist Church began an order called &quot;local pastors,&quot; who are appointed by a bishop to serve in one local charge.

==Lay preaching in other denominations==

Although Methodism has perhaps organised the institution of local preaching more thoroughly than any other denomination, lay preachers are used by many other churches. The other Nonconformist churches in Britain have long had similar arrangements, and the Church of England now makes considerable use of lay readers. However, Anglican lay readers, and indeed the lay preachers of other denominations, have never quite enjoyed the status within their own churches, or the recognition beyond them, that are associated with the Methodist local preacher.

<text>Owen Guinn Smith (May 2, 1920 – January 20, 2004) was an American athlete, the 1948 Olympic champion in the pole vault.

Born in McKinney, Texas, Smith moved to California when he was a child. He was originally a high jumper, but UC Berkeley, the university he wanted to attend, already had a strong high jumping team, so he took up pole vaulting. He won the NCAA championships in 1941, the year before he graduated as a history major. During the remainder of World War II, Guinn Smith served as an air force pilot in Asia.

Smith, the 1947 national pole vault champion, was sent to the 1948 Olympics in London. During a rainy competition, Smith took the gold in his last attempt for 4.30 m (14 ft 1 in).

He died at age 83 in San Francisco of emphysema.

<text>EHL Hospitality Business School, formerly known as École hôtelière de Lausanne, is a hospitality management school in Switzerland. The school is often seen as one of the best of its kind in the world, training its students to obtain managerial careers in the hotel and hospitality industries.

Its campus is located in Le Chalet-à-Gobet, near the city center of Lausanne. The school currently teaches more than 3,300 students from 123 different countries.

==History==
Founded in 1893 by Jacques Tschumi, École hôtelière de Lausanne is the oldest hotel school in the world. It opened during the tourism boom in Switzerland in the late 19th century in response to high demand for skilled and qualified personnel.

In 1994, EHL launched its new Bachelor of Science in International Hospitality Management.

In 2001, EHL launched an EMBA (Executive Master in Hospitality Administration) program, a graduate degree in hospitality management from the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Western Switzerland (HES-SO).

==Education==
It prepares students for senior international positions in the field through five programs:

* The Bachelor of Science in International Hospitality Management (taught in English or French), which includes a preparatory year of immersion into the hospitality industry, three years of coursework studying business management topics, two six-month internships (often taken abroad), and a 10-week consulting mandate
* The Master of Science in Global Hospitality Business, a three-semester program in partnership with the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the University of Houston, with courses taught in Lausanne (Switzerland), Hong Kong (China) and Houston (United States)
* The MBA in Hospitality, delivered 80% online starting September 2017
* The Executive MBA in Hospitality Administration, a 12-month post-graduate program in hotel and hospitality management
* The Master Class in Culinary Arts, a six-month certificate focused on the advanced aspects of culinary arts such as international cuisine, gastronomy and baking

EHL offers financial support to talented students who are unable to enroll due to financial hardship.

==Campus==

The EHL campus contains several training restaurants for students in the preparatory year, including the Berceau des Sens, a gourmet restaurant that is open to the public and recognized by the Gault Millau guide. In 2019, the restaurant was awarded One Michelin Star. It also has several bars, 48 classrooms, auditoriums, a library, study rooms, a wine tasting room, a cafeteria, a boutique, a historic building, sports areas, and dorms.

EHL has adopted several sustainability initiatives, including a waste management system, vegetable garden, heat recovery system for cold storage, solar panels, and two electric cars on campus.

In 2013, EHL launched a project to further develop its campus through a collaborative exchange of ideas involving 385 architecture and landscape design students from around the world. Preparatory work should start in the fall of 2016, and should end within four years. The cost of the project is estimated at 226 million Swiss francs.

==Accreditations==
Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne is accredited as an Institution of Higher Education, issued by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC, USA). This accreditation ensures that the institution meets the international standards of higher education, and facilitates credit transfers and degree recognition from American institutions.

Within Switzerland, it is the only hospitality school offering training affiliated with the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Western Switzerland (HES-SO), attesting to the high teaching quality and allowing the issued qualifications to be protected by Swiss law.

The Executive MBA in Hospitality Administration program was recognized by the Swiss Center of Accreditation and Quality Assurance in Higher Education (AAQ) as meeting their quality standards.

==Rankings==
Based on a study done by TNS Sofres in 2007, 2010 and 2013 with managers and recruiters from the hospitality world, EHL is considered to be the best in the world with regard to graduate job placement in international hospitality careers.

In 2013 and 2014, EHL was named the Best Hospitality Management School in the international competition of the Worldwide Hospitality Awards.

In 2019 EHL was ranked No.1 Worldwide by QS World University Rankings (Hospitality and Leisure Management category.

EHL also ranked No.1 on the list of the best hospitality and hotel management schools in the world (CEO World Magazine, 2019)

==Faculty and research==
Since 2014, the EHL research center, in partnership with STR, aims to become a premier source of research in the field of international hospitality. The EHL Food &amp; Beverage Chair, supported by the food production and marketing group Saviva, has studied the changes and challenges of the restaurant industry market since 2010. The METRO Innovation Chair is dedicated to research and innovation in the hospitality and restaurant field.

Many gastronomy experts are part of the school&#x27;s faculty, including several Meilleurs Ouvriers de France (MOF).

==Collaboration with industry==

A Business Incubator was established in 2012 to support start-ups who want to start in the hospitality sector.

EHL has established an International Advisory Board composed of international leaders in the hospitality and education sector, which provides the school with an opportunity to benefit from direct feedback and experiences from the industry.
In November 2013, EHL acquired the Swiss School of Tourism and Hospitality (SSTH) at Passugg, Switzerland, which teaches tourism, gastronomy and hospitality.

The area was known as Adac to the Cochimí people, the aboriginal inhabitants of the central part of the Baja California peninsula. In the early 1600s approximately 3000 Cochimi were inhabiting the area.

In 1539 Francisco de Ulloa was the first European to discover the Bay in what was the final expedition financed by Hernán Cortés. The area known then as the (Bay of Sea Lions) was explored again in 1746 by the Jesuit missionary Fernando Consag during his attempt to investigate the disputed question involving the Island of California. Consag is credited with giving the area its current name. In 1752, a loading dock was built to explore Mission San Borja and the entire Baja California Peninsula.

After the departure of the Jesuits from the Baja Missions, the surrounding settlements, known at the time as visitas (&quot;visiting chapels&quot;), were gradually taken over by the locals, Bahia being one of them. By 1880, the interest in precious metals had spread to the Bahia region. In 1900, another loading dock was built to export gold and silver obtained from the mines of Sierra San Borja, San Juan, and Santa Martha. The San Juan silver mine at Las Flores became the largest producing mine in all of Baja. The mine was connected to the Bahia by an , which allowed the ore to be transferred to the port there. The value of the silver produced by the mine was estimated (in 2002) to be 2 million U.S. dollars.

In the mid-20th century, only a handful of families were residing there. Among those were the Daggetts (the children and grandchildren of Englishman Dick Daggett Sr.), the family of Jose &quot;Tilongo&quot; Smith, the Ocañas, Navarros, and Corderos. Señor Antero &quot;Papa&quot; Diaz (1914–1989) was the leading citizen of the pueblo known as Bahía de los Ángeles. Diaz and his wife, Cruz Rosas Ortiz &quot;Mama&quot; Diaz, originated in Mexico City and came to the bahia to work the mine at Las Flores. Diaz became Delegado del Gobierno (Mayor) and built the first schoolhouse and the first church in Bahia. He was also instrumental in establishing the town as a sport fishing resort by building a hotel and an airstrip. This allowed fishermen to reach the bahia by air without making the 3 day drive from Ensenada. The original &quot;Casa Diaz&quot; hotel consisted of Mama&#x27;s restaurant and 6 cabins with primitive showers.

In his book, &quot;The Log from the Sea of Cortez&quot;, author John Steinbeck wrote of his stay in Bahía de los Ángeles, the last stop on the peninsula before rounding Isla Ángel de la Guarda.

Bahia is also the home of the &quot;Museo de Naturaleza y Cultura&quot;, established in 1988 by American Carolina Shepard and built by volunteers. It is a simple building decorated with reproductions of local cave paintings and located near the town square and municipal offices. It houses an eclectic collection of artifacts ranging from mining equipment and Indian artifacts to examples of local marine life and photographs of notable historical citizens. A 30-foot-long skeleton of a juvenile gray whale, assembled by students from Ensenada, hangs from the ceiling. Of the 600 species of shells in the Sea of Cortés, the museum&#x27;s collection contains 500. There is even a photograph of Mama Diaz next to Charles Lindbergh. Lindbergh had stopped in 1965 during his flight to Laguna San Ignacio to see the gray whales.

==Environment==
The area has a desert climate. At the bay&#x27;s north end lies Punta la Gringa and Playa Rincon to the south. To the west is the Sierra de San Borja responsible for the occasional hot, dry winds known locally as &quot;Westies&quot; which can go from zero to over 50 knots in a matter of minutes. On the eastern horizon lies Isla Ángel de la Guarda separated from the other islands by the Canal de las Ballenas. There is an Archipelago of 16 islands off the coast and in the bay.


There is a lighthouse on Isla Cabeza de Caballo, an island in the center of the channel into the town. A second lighthouse is located at the entrance to the harbor on Punta Arenas, a sand spit partially sheltering the waterfront of Bahía.

Bahia is notable as an anchorage and safe harbor. The nearby Don Juan Cove is another ideal safe harbor.

===Biosphere Reserve===
In 2007, Mexican President Felipe Calderón, in cooperation with the nongovernmental organization Pronatura Noreste, Mexico’s National Commission for Protected Areas, the Global Conservation Fund (GCF), and others, established the Bahía de los Ángeles Biosphere Reserve to protect the unique ecology of the region. It covers an area of almost 1500 square miles (387,956 hectares) and includes a portion of the Baja coastline, all 16 islands, numerous smaller islands and islets and the Canal de Salsipuedes and Canal de las Ballenas. The reserve protects a diverse marine population including many endangered species including whale sharks, fin whales, California sea lions and five species of sea turtle. The reserve is within the UNESCO &quot;Islands and Protected Areas of the Gulf of California&quot; Mexican World Heritage Site.

==Economy==
Overfishing of the region has made it increasingly difficult for residents to support themselves. The local economy is shifting from commercial fishing to guided sports fishing and other forms of tourism. Bahia is home to perhaps a dozen pangueros (panga operators) who specialize in sport fishing. Before the highway into the area was paved, the town was known as a drug transit point on the way to the United States. In 2007, power lines from Guerrero Negro were completed, ending reliance on diesel generators. There is internet access via satellite. The Baja 1000 passes through town every other year. The Bahía de los Ángeles Airport is just north of the town.

===Tourism===
Bay of LA is popular for activities such as kayaking, windsurfing, and tourism, in addition to being a sports fisherman&#x27;s paradise, famous for its fabulous fishing. The most common game fish is yellowtail (&quot;jurel&quot;), a type of sport fish that lives off the shore of California and Mexico. Yellowtail from this region can grow up to 5 feet long and weigh up to 100 pounds. Other sport fish from this region include sea bass (&quot;cabrilla&quot;), snapper (&quot;pargo&quot;), grouper, sierra, bonito and the occasional mahi-mahi (&quot;dorado&quot;). Non-sport fish like triggerfish, barracuda and others exist in abundance. There are two colonies of the California sea lion population, one on Isla Calavera near Isla Coronado known locally as &quot;Smith Island&quot;, and Isla El Racito, within Ensenada El Alacran. The bay is also famous for its whale sharks (&quot;Tiburón Ballena&quot;) with 20 to 30 visiting the area each summer.

About 15 – 20 miles west of town are the prehistoric rock paintings of Montevideo, part of the Great Mural region considered to be one of the most important archaeological sites in Baja California. Known officially as Pinturas Rupestres de Valle Montevideo they are estimated by some to be 10,000 years old.

===Conservation===
Marine biologist Antonio Resendiz (RIP) ran a sea turtle research facility, known as Campo Archelon, north of town. The area around Bahia de los Angeles provides nesting grounds for many species of sea turtles. Beginning in 1979 the officially named &quot;Centro Regional de Investigacion Pesquera (CRIP)&quot; had conducted sea turtle research and conservation. Antonio, who studied marine biology at the University of Ensenada, established the research station first with the help of the Mexican Institute of Fishing and later through the help of American biochemist Dr. Grant Bartlett. Antonio made news in 1995 when one of his turtles, a 213-pound loggerhead named Adelita, was discovered off the coast of Japan by local fishermen. The discovery established the migration path of loggerheads for the first time.

<text>The Auteurs were a British alternative rock band of the 1990s, and a vehicle for songwriter Luke Haines (guitar, piano and vocals).

==History==
Formerly a member of the Servants, Haines created the Auteurs with his then-girlfriend Alice Readman on bass guitar, former classmate Glenn Collins on drums, and later added James Banbury on cello. 

The Auteurs demo tape and gig led to the band gaining a recording contract with Hut. Their first single &quot;Show Girl&quot; was praised by the British music magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and the album &quot;New Wave&quot; (1993) was nominated for a Mercury Music Prize. The Auteurs later became associated with the Britpop movement. However this association was not liked by Haines, who frequently made derogatory remarks about his peers. After &quot;New Wave&quot;, the band remained on the fringes of the music scene. Drummer Glen Collins was replaced by Barny C. Rockford, after being headhunted from Out of My Hair by producer Phil Vinall. Their next album &quot;Now I&#x27;m a Cowboy&quot; (1994), built on the themes of &quot;New Wave&quot; and contained Haines&#x27; best known song, &quot;Lenny Valentino&quot;. Demonstrating, again, their difference from their musical peers, the band&#x27;s next release was &quot;The Auteurs vs. μ-Ziq&quot;, Auteurs songs remixed by producer μ-Ziq (aka Michael Paradinas). In interviews at the time Haines claimed he found contemporary techno and house music more interesting than most Britpop bands. 

In 1996, The Auteurs released &quot;After Murder Park&quot;, produced by Steve Albini, and it included &quot;Land Lovers&quot;, &quot;Unsolved Child Murder&quot;, and &quot;Buddha&quot;. The album was recorded at Abbey Road Studios following a year during which Haines had spent most of his time in a wheelchair after jumping off a wall. Haines made the &quot;Baader Meinhof&quot; album as a solo artist under the name Baader Meinhof, using some musicians from the Auteurs. The Auteurs supported Baader Meinhof at a London show in Camden&#x27;s Dingwalls. The last Auteurs record, &quot;How I Learned to Love the Bootboys&quot;, was released in 1999. Alice Readman left the band around the time of the last album, and was replaced by various musicians for live/touring purposes.

==Post-Breakup==
Haines worked as one third of the art-pop band Black Box Recorder. In 2001 he released the soundtrack album to the film &quot;Christie Malry&#x27;s Own Double-Entry&quot;, rapidly followed by his first solo album proper, &quot;The Oliver Twist Manifesto&quot;. 2003 saw him release &quot;Das Capital&quot;, a collection of re-recorded Auteurs era songs, with a couple of new tracks, apparently intended as closure for that band.

Banbury went on to record an album with Paul Morley under the name Infantjoy, entitled &quot;Where the Night Goes&quot; featuring a vocal performance by Sarah Nixey of Black Box Recorder singing a version of Japan&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts&quot;. An Infantjoy album – &quot;With –&quot; was released in 2006 with collaborators including Tunng, Isan and Populous. 

In January 2009, Haines released a book entitled &quot;Bad Vibes&quot;, which serves dually as an autobiographical account of his years with the Auteurs, and as a record of the Britpop movement of the 1990s. Throughout the book, he never refers to James Banbury by name, referring to him simply as &quot;the Cellist&quot;, although he is named in full in the acknowledgements. Banbury later worked with Pete Davis under the name Dadahack. Their debut album &quot;TAP3&quot; was a hybrid cassette/mp3 playing device and was released in April 2010.

In 2014, British independent label 3 Loop Music re-released all of the Auteurs&#x27; albums (along with Haines&#x27; &quot;Baader Meinhoff&quot; album) as expanded editions which featured b-sides, demos, radio session tracks, live recordings and remixes. &quot;New Wave&quot; and &quot;Baader Meinhoff&quot; were also re-released by the label on heavyweight 180gsm vinyl.

<doc id="454300" wikidata="Q1766751" url="?curid=454300" title="Constellation program">
<text>The Constellation program (abbreviated CxP) was a crewed spaceflight program developed by NASA, the space agency of the United States, from 2005 to 2009. The major goals of the program were &quot;completion of the International Space Station&quot; and a &quot;return to the Moon no later than 2020&quot; with a crewed flight to the planet Mars as the ultimate goal. The program&#x27;s logo reflected the three stages of the program: the Earth (ISS), the Moon, and finally Mars—while the Mars goal also found expression in the name given to the program&#x27;s booster rockets: Ares (the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Mars). The technological aims of the program included the regaining of significant astronaut experience beyond low Earth orbit and the development of technologies necessary to enable sustained human presence on other planetary bodies.

Constellation began in response to the goals laid out in the Vision for Space Exploration under NASA Administrator Sean O&#x27;Keefe and President George W. Bush. O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s successor, Michael D. Griffin, ordered a complete review, termed the Exploration Systems Architecture Study, which reshaped how NASA would pursue the goals laid out in the Vision for Space Exploration, and its findings were formalized by the NASA Authorization Act of 2005. The Act directed NASA to &quot;develop a sustained human presence on the Moon, including a robust precursor program to promote exploration, science, commerce and US preeminence in space, and as a stepping stone to future exploration of Mars and other destinations.&quot; Work began on this revised Constellation Program, to send astronauts first to the International Space Station, then to the Moon, and then to Mars and beyond.

Subsequent to the findings of the Augustine Committee in 2009 that the Constellation Program could not be executed without substantial increases in funding, on February 1, 2010, President Barack Obama proposed to cancel the program, effective with the passage of the U.S. 2011 fiscal year budget. He then revised administration statements in a major space policy speech at Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010. On October 11, the signing of the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 shelved the program, with Constellation contracts remaining in place until Congress would act to overturn the previous mandate. In 2011, NASA adopted the design of its new Space Launch System.

==Designs==
One of the main goals of Constellation was the development of spacecraft and booster vehicles to replace the Space Shuttle. NASA had already begun designing two boosters, the Ares I and Ares V, when the program was created. Ares I was designed for the sole purpose of launching mission crews into orbit, while Ares V would have been used to launch other hardware which required a heavier lift capacity than the Ares I booster provided. In addition to these two boosters, NASA designed other spacecraft for use during Constellation, including the Orion crew capsule, the Earth Departure Stage secondary booster, and the Altair lunar lander.

===Vehicles===

====Orion====
The Orion spacecraft was designed for the Constellation program as a crew compartment for use in low Earth orbit. Lockheed Martin was selected as the prime contractor for the Orion project on August 31, 2006, and Boeing was selected to build its primary heat shield on September 15, 2006. NASA initially planned to develop different Orion capsules tailored for specific missions. The Block I Orion was to be used for International Space Station missions and other Earth orbit missions, while the Block II and III variants were designed for deep-space exploration.

Orion&#x27;s design consists of three main parts: a crew module (CM) similar to the Apollo command module, but capable of sustaining four to six crew members; a cylindrical service module (SM) containing the primary propulsion systems and consumable supplies; and the Launch Abort System (LAS), which provides capability for the astronauts and Crew Module to escape from the launch vehicle should problems arise during launch ascent. The Orion Crew Module is designed to be reusable, allowing NASA to construct a fleet of Orion crew modules.

Despite the cancellation of the Constellation program, development of the Orion spacecraft continues, with a test launch performed on December 5, 2014. Orion flew aboard Artemis I in 2022 and is planned to fly aboard Artemis II in 2026 and on several subsequent missions.

====Altair====
Altair (formerly known as the Lunar Surface Access Module, LSAM) was designed to be the main transport vehicle for astronauts on lunar missions. The Altair design was much larger than its predecessor, the Apollo Lunar Module, at almost five times the volume, occupying a total of compared with the Apollo lander&#x27;s . It was to stand tall and span wide from tip to tip of the landing gear.

Like its predecessor, the Altair design consists of two parts: an ascent stage which houses the four-person crew; and a descent stage consisting of the landing gear, and storage for the majority of the crew&#x27;s consumables (oxygen and water) and for scientific equipment. Unlike the Lunar Module, Altair was designed to land in the lunar polar regions favored by NASA for future lunar base construction. Altair, like the Lunar Module, was not designed to be reusable, and the ascent stage would be discarded after use.

The Altair descent stage was to be powered by four RL-10 rocket engines, which are also those used in the Centaur upper stage of the Atlas V rocket. Unlike the current RL-10 engines in use, these newer RL-10s were to have the ability to throttle down to as low as 10% rated thrust (the older specifications allow for 20%), thus allowing the use of Altair for both the lunar orbit insertion (LOI) and landing stages of lunar missions. The ascent stage was designed to be powered by a single engine, likely a hypergolic engine similar or identical to the main engine of the Orion CSM, which would use the descent stage as both a launchpad and a platform for future base construction. Alternately, there was a small possibility that the original plan of using LOX/CH4–fueled engines on board the Block II (lunar) Orion CSM and Altair ascent stage would have been adopted.

===Propulsion===
NASA planned to use two separate boosters for the Constellation Program missions – the Ares I for crew and the Ares V for cargo. This would have allowed the two launch vehicles to be optimized for their respective missions, and allowed a much higher total lift for the Ares V without being cost-prohibitive. The Constellation Program thus combined the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous method adopted by the Apollo program&#x27;s lunar missions with the Earth Orbit Rendezvous method which had also been considered.

The name Ares (the Greek god called Mars in Roman mythology) was chosen for the boosters as a reference to the project&#x27;s goal of landing on Mars. The numbers I and V were chosen to pay homage to the Saturn rockets of the 1960s.

====Ares I====
The Orion spacecraft would have been launched into a low Earth orbit by the Ares I rocket (the &quot;Stick&quot;), developed by Alliant Techsystems, Rocketdyne, and Boeing. Formerly referred to as the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), the Ares I consisted of a single Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) derived in part from the primary boosters used in the Space Shuttle system, connected at its upper end by an interstage support assembly to a new liquid-fueled second stage powered by a J-2X rocket engine. NASA selected the Ares designs for their anticipated overall safety, reliability and cost-efficiency.

NASA began developing the Ares I low Earth orbit launch vehicle (analogous to Apollo&#x27;s Saturn IB), returning to a development philosophy used for the original Saturn I, test-launching one stage at a time, which George Mueller had firmly opposed and abandoned in favor of &quot;all-up&quot; testing for the Saturn V. As of May 2010, the program got as far as launching the first Ares I-X first-stage flight on October 28, 2009 and testing the Orion launch abort system before its cancellation.

====Ares V====
Ares V would have had a maximum lift capacity of about to low Earth orbit (LEO), compared to the Space Shuttle&#x27;s capacity of , and the Saturn V&#x27;s . The Ares V would have carried about to the Moon, versus the Saturn V&#x27;s lunar payload.

The Ares V design consisted of six RS-68 engines with assistance from a pair of 5.5-segment SRBs. Five RS-25 engines were originally planned for the Ares V, but the RS-68 engines are more powerful and less complex and therefore less expensive than the SSMEs. The Ares V would have flown for the first eight minutes of powered flight, then the Earth Departure Stage would have placed itself and the Altair spacecraft into low Earth orbit while awaiting the arrival of the Orion. Toward the end of the program, it became apparent that the ablatively-cooled RS-68B engines would not withstand the heat from the solid rocket boosters at launch, and NASA began again to consider using RS-25 engines instead of upgrading the RS-68 to be regeneratively-cooled.

====Earth Departure Stage====

The Earth Departure Stage (EDS) was the propulsion system designed to put the Altair upper stage on a lunar trajectory from within low Earth orbit. It was designed as the second liquid-fueled stage of the Ares V rocket. The Orion spacecraft would have been launched separately by Ares I, and then met and docked with the Ares V-launched EDS/Altair combination, delivering the crew and configuring the spacecraft for its journey to the Moon in a process known as Earth orbit rendezvous.

===Comparison to Apollo and Space Shuttle designs===
NASA planned to use the first vehicles developed in the Constellation Program for Earth-orbit tasks formerly undertaken by the Space Shuttle. But unlike the X-33 and other programs intended to replace the Shuttle, Constellation reused concepts from the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs.

The shape of the Orion command module closely resembles the aerodynamic shape of the Apollo command and service module. However, in other areas Orion employs updated technology. The design of the launch vehicle taking Orion into orbit, the Ares I, employs many concepts from the Apollo program.

The design of the J-2X engine intended for use on the Ares V booster rocket was originally to be similar to the J-2 engine of the Apollo-era Saturn V and Saturn IB rockets. In designing the J-2X, NASA engineers visited museums, searched for Apollo-era documentation and consulted with engineers who worked on the Apollo program. &quot;The mechanics of landing on the Moon and getting off the Moon to a large extent have been solved,&quot; said Constellation program manager Jeff Hanley. &quot;That is the legacy that Apollo gave us.&quot; However, as the J-2X program progressed, it became apparent that, because of revised safety requirements and the growing mass of the upper stage, it was necessary to scrap the original J-2 design completely and use a completely new design for the J-2X.

Like Apollo, Constellation would have flown a lunar orbit rendezvous mission profile, but unlike Apollo, Constellation would have also employed Earth orbit rendezvous, conveying the crew to the vehicle. The lander, known as Altair, would have been launched separately on the Ares V rocket, a rocket based on both Space Shuttle and Apollo technologies. Orion would have been launched separately and would have linked up with Altair in low Earth orbit. Also, unlike Apollo, Orion would have remained uncrewed in lunar orbit while the entire crew landed on the lunar surface. Toward the end of the mission, the Altair spacecraft would have launched into lunar orbit to link up with the Orion spacecraft in lunar orbit rendezvous. Like Apollo, the Orion capsule would then have returned to Earth, re-entering the atmosphere and landing in water.

==Missions==
Like those of the Apollo Program, Constellation program missions would involve its main vehicle, the Orion spacecraft, flying missions in low Earth orbit to service the International Space Station, and in conjunction with the Altair and Earth Departure Stage vehicles, on crewed flights to the polar regions of the Moon. There were no well-defined plans at the time of cancelation for a crewed flight to Mars, the ultimate goal of the project, but a mission to a Near-Earth asteroid was in the initial planning phase as of 2008.

===International Space Station and low-Earth orbit flights===
After being manufactured at private plants, the parts of the Ares I/Orion stack would be tested and assembled at the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center. Once assembly was completed and a launch date was set, the crawler-transporter would transport the completed stack, along with the launch support tower and the Mobile Launcher-1, out to LC-39B. Once the crawler-transporter reached the pad, the stack and the Launcher Platform would be left in place and the crawler-transporter removed to a safe distance.

After final safety checks, the ground crew would fill up the second stage with liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) fuel, and the crew, wearing all-purpose spacesuits, would enter the spacecraft three hours before liftoff. Once they were locked in, and after all systems were cleared by controllers at both the Cape and Mission Control in Houston, the Ares I would then launch.

After a two-day orbital chase, the Orion spacecraft, having jettisoned much of the initial stack during takeoff, would meet with the International Space Station. After getting the go ahead from Houston, Orion would then dock with the ISS. The six-man crew (at a maximum) would then enter the station in order to perform numerous tasks and activities for the duration of their flight, usually lasting six months, but possibly shortened to four or lengthened to eight, depending upon NASA&#x27;s goals for that particular mission. Once completed, the crew would then reenter the Orion, seal itself off from the ISS, and then undock from the station.

Once the Orion reached a safe distance from the ISS, the Command Module (after having jettisoned the disposable service module) would re-enter in the same manner as all NASA spacecraft prior to the Shuttle, using the ablative heat shield to both deflect heat from the spacecraft and to slow it down from a speed of to . After reentry was completed, the forward assembly would be jettisoned, and two drogue parachutes released, followed at by three main parachutes and airbags filled with nitrogen (N2), which does not combust when exposed to heat, allowing the spacecraft to splashdown. The Command Module would then be returned to Kennedy Space Center for refurbishment for a later flight. Unlike the Apollo CM, which was used only for one flight, an Orion CM could theoretically be used up to ten times under normal operating conditions.

===Lunar sortie flights===

Unlike the Apollo missions, where both the Apollo command and service module and the Apollo Lunar Module were launched together on the Saturn V rocket, the crewed Orion spacecraft would be launched separately from the uncrewed EDS and lunar lander. The Ares V/Altair stack would be assembled at the Vehicle Assembly Building and then transported to LC-39A, and the Ares M/Orion stack would be transported to the adjacent Pad 39B. The Ares V/EDS/Altair stack would be launched first, into a high circular orbit. Approximately 90 minutes later, the Ares I/Orion would then launch with the crew into a nearly identical orbit.

The Orion would then rendezvous and dock with the Altair/EDS combination already in low-Earth orbit. After the necessary preparations for lunar flight, the EDS would fire for 390 seconds in a translunar injection (TLI) maneuver, accelerating the spacecraft to . After this burn, the EDS would be jettisoned.

During the three-day trans-lunar coast, the four-man crew would monitor the Orion&#x27;s systems, inspect their Altair spacecraft and its support equipment, and correct their flight path as necessary to allow the Altair to land at a near-polar landing site suitable for a future lunar base. Approaching the lunar far side, the Orion/Altair combination would orient the Altair&#x27;s engines forward and make the lunar orbit insertion (LOI) burn.

Once in lunar orbit, the crew would refine the trajectory and configure the Orion spacecraft for uncrewed flight, allowing all four crew members to transfer to the Altair vehicle and land on the Moon, while the Orion waits for their return. Upon receiving clearance from Mission Control, the Altair would undock from the Orion and perform an inspection maneuver, allowing ground controllers to inspect the spacecraft via live TV mounted on Orion for any visible problems that would prevent landing (on Apollo this was done by the Command Module Pilot). After receiving approval from ground controllers, the two craft would separate to a safe distance and the Altair&#x27;s descent engines would fire again for powered descent to a pre-determined landing spot previously selected by uncrewed spacecraft.

Upon landing, the crew would put on their extravehicular activity (EVA) spacesuits and commence the first of five to seven lunar EVAs, collecting samples and deploying experiments. After completing their Lunar Sortie operations, the crew would then enter the Altair and fire the ascent stage engine to lift off from the surface, using the descent stage as a launchpad (and leaving it as a platform for future base construction). Upon entering orbit, the Altair would rendezvous and dock with the waiting Orion spacecraft, and the crew would then transfer, along with samples collected on the Moon, back to the Orion. After jettisoning the Altair, the crew would perform the Trans Earth Injection (TEI) burn for the return trip to Earth.

After a two-and-a-half-day coast, the crew would jettison the Service Module (allowing it to burn up in the atmosphere) and the CM would reenter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere using a special reentry trajectory designed to slow the vehicle from its speed of to and thus allow a Pacific Ocean splashdown. The Crew Module would then be flown back to Kennedy Space Center for refurbishment, while lunar samples would be routed to the Johnson Space Center&#x27;s (JSC) Lunar Receiving Laboratory for analysis.

===Orion asteroid mission===

The &quot;Orion Asteroid Mission&quot; was a proposed NASA mission to a near-Earth asteroid (NEA) which would use the standard Orion spacecraft, and a landing module based on a modified Altair lunar lander. Most of its specific details are now deprecated by the cancellation of the Constellation Program and related designs. Such a mission could assess the potential value of water, iron, nickel, platinum and other resources on the asteroid; test possible ways to extract them; and possibly examine or develop techniques which could be used to protect the Earth from asteroid impacts. This would be the first crewed mission to any extraterrestrial body besides the Moon, and would represent a step towards a human mission to Mars.

The mission would start in a similar fashion to the lunar landing mission described above, using an Ares V to launch the landing module into Low Earth orbit, followed by the launch of an Orion spacecraft, with a two- or three-person crew (as opposed to a four-person crew for lunar missions) on an Ares I rocket. Once the Orion spacecraft docked with the landing module and the Earth Departure Stage (EDS), the EDS would then fire again and propel the Orion spacecraft to a nearby near-Earth asteroid where the crew would then land and explore its surface.

Once the task was completed, the Orion spacecraft would then depart from the asteroid and, upon reaching the vicinity of Earth, would jettison both the service module and the landing module in a manner similar to that of Apollo 13 before entering the atmosphere for a Pacific Ocean splashdown.

===Orion Mars mission===
The ultimate goal of NASA&#x27;s Constellation program was a crewed mission landing humans on Mars in the 2030s as a spiritual successor to the Apollo Applications Program in the 1960s. The mission would utilize the hardware of the Constellation Project, primarily the Orion spacecraft (or a variation based on the Orion), and the Ares V cargo-launch vehicle.

A design study utilizing Constellation launch vehicles, known as Design Reference Architecture 5.0, was completed in 2009. In DRA 5.0, a Mars mission would have involved multiple launches of an Ares V rocket, as well as an Ares I to launch the crew. In the first Mars launch window, two cargo payloads would be launched into Earth orbit, as well as a nuclear thermal rocket stage for each payload, in order to boost them to Mars. Alternatively, chemical (specifically liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen) propellant stages could have been used, although this would have required more launches. One cargo payload would include a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), as well as In-situ resource utilization equipment to generate propellant for the MAV. The second cargo payload would be a habitat that the astronauts would live in during the stay on the surface. In the next launch window, 26 months after the first, the crew would go to Mars in an interplanetary transfer vehicle with nuclear thermal rocket and propellant modules assembled in Earth orbit. Once at Mars, the crew would rendezvous with the Mars habitat in orbit, land on Mars, and explore for 500 days. The crew would use the MAV to return to their interplanetary vehicle in Mars orbit, which would then be used to return to Earth. The mission would conclude with the re-entry and landing of the Orion capsule.

===Justification for a return to the Moon===
NASA lists a number of reasons for a human return to the Moon on its website:
#to extend human colonization,
#to further pursue scientific activities intrinsic to the Moon,
#to test new technologies, systems, flight operations and techniques to serve future space exploration missions,
#to provide a challenging, shared and peaceful activity to unite nations in pursuit of common objectives,
#to expand the economic sphere while conducting research activities that benefit our home planet,
#to engage the public and students to help develop the high-technology workforce that will be required to address the challenges of tomorrow.

In the words of former NASA Administrator, Michael D. Griffin, &quot;The goal isn&#x27;t just scientific exploration... It&#x27;s also about extending the range of human habitat out from Earth into the Solar System as we go forward in time... In the long run a single-planet species will not survive... If we humans want to survive for hundreds of thousands or millions of years, we must ultimately populate other planets ... colonize the Solar System and one day go beyond.&quot;

A report published in June 2014 by the US National Academy of Sciences called for clear long-term space goals at NASA. The report said that the agency&#x27;s current course invited &quot;failure, disillusionment, and [loss of] the longstanding international perception that human space-flight is something that the United States does best.&quot; The report recommended that Mars be the next major goal of human space flight. Several possible paths for reaching the planet by 2037 were explored in the report, which noted that returning to the Moon would offer &quot;significant advantages&quot; as an intermediate step in the process.

The National Space Society (NSS), a private nonprofit, regards a return to the Moon as a high priority for the US space program, in order to develop the body of scientific knowledge of the Moon, particularly in regards to its potential for the creation of new industries, in order to provide further funding for further space exploration.

==Budget and cancellation==

===Bush administration===
On January 14, 2004 President George W. Bush requested that NASA develop a proposal for continued crewed space exploration after the completion of the International Space Station and the planned retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2010. This proposal was to be a way to &quot;establish an extended human presence on the Moon&quot; to &quot;vastly reduce the costs of further space exploration.&quot; Included in this would be the &quot;harvesting and processing of lunar soil into rocket fuel or breathable air.&quot; According to Bush, experience gained could help &quot;develop and test new approaches and technologies and systems&quot; to begin a &quot;sustainable course of long-term exploration.&quot;

NASA estimated that the original policy would cost $230 billion (in 2004 dollars) through 2025, including the Commercial Crew and Cargo program, which is separate from the Constellation program. However, unsolved technical and design challenges made it impossible for NASA to provide a conclusive estimate.

===Obama administration===

Upon taking office, President Obama declared Constellation to be &quot;over budget, behind schedule, and lacking in innovation.&quot; A review concluded that it would cost on the order of $150 billion for Constellation to reach its objective if adhering to the original schedule. Another review in 2009, ordered by President Obama, indicated that neither a return to the Moon nor a crewed flight to Mars was within NASA&#x27;s current budget. The Augustine panel proposed various options, that included two primary destination points (the Moon and deep space), three different types of Super Heavy Launch vehicles, and a robust research and development program that would include work on propellant depots.

After reviewing the report, and following congressional testimony, the Obama administration decided to exclude Constellation from the 2011 United States federal budget. On February 1, 2010, the President&#x27;s proposed budget was released, which included no funding for the project, and it became law on April 15, 2011.

President Obama hosted a Space Conference on April 15, 2010, in Florida. This came at a time when the president&#x27;s administration was being criticized considerably for leaving the Constellation Program out of the 2011 budget. At the conference, President Obama and top officials, as well as leaders in the field of spaceflight, discussed the future of U.S. efforts in human spaceflight and unveiled a plan for NASA that followed the Augustine Panel&#x27;s &quot;Flexible Path to Mars&quot; option, modifying President Obama&#x27;s prior proposal to include the continuing development of the Orion capsule as an auxiliary system to the ISS and setting the year 2015 as the deadline for the design of a new Super Heavy Launch Vehicle. In October 2010, the NASA authorization bill for 2010 was signed into law which canceled Constellation. However, previous legislation kept Constellation contracts in force until passage of a new funding bill for 2011.

=== Commercial Crew Vehicles and the Artemis program ===
NASA continues the development of the Orion spacecraft for deep space travel. In an effort to reduce costs, it has contracted for private development of vehicles for use in low Earth orbit. Since May 2020, the Commercial Crew Development program has used the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft to bring people to and from the International Space Station, while Boeing&#x27;s Starliner spacecraft started operating in 2024 for the same purpose. Furthermore, it seeks human-rating for the launch vehicles in the United States Air Force Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles program. Private spacecraft are also operating under the Commercial Resupply Services program bringing cargo to ISS.

The Orion spacecraft and Ares V (also Jupiter DIRECT family of rockets) was modified and reauthorized in 2010/2011 as the main payload of the Space Launch System, and &quot;the&quot; Space Launch System, and the program was partially revived as the Artemis program in 2017.

<doc id="454303" wikidata="Q6594912" url="?curid=454303" title="List of presidents of the United States by education">
<text>Most presidents of the United States received a college education, even most of the earliest. Of the first seven presidents, five were college graduates. College degrees have set the presidents apart from the general population, and presidents have held degrees even though it was quite rare and unnecessary for practicing most occupations, including law. Of the 45 individuals to have been the president, 24 graduated from a private undergraduate college, 9 graduated from a public undergraduate college, and 12 held no degree. Every president since 1953 has had a bachelor&#x27;s degree, reflecting the increasing importance of higher education in the United States.

== List by university attended ==
=== Did not graduate from college ===

*George Washington (The death of Washington&#x27;s father ended his formal schooling. The College of William &amp; Mary issued surveying licenses in Virginia, and Washington received his license from the College in 1749 — surveyors did not attend classes at the school. Washington believed strongly in formal education, and his will left money and/or stocks to support three educational institutions, including George Washington University and Washington and Lee University)
*James Monroe (attended the College of William &amp; Mary, but dropped out to fight in the Revolutionary War)
*Andrew Jackson
*Martin Van Buren
*William Henry Harrison (attended Hampden Sydney College for three years but did not graduate and then attended University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine but never received a degree)
*Zachary Taylor
*Millard Fillmore (founded the University at Buffalo)
*Abraham Lincoln (had only about a year of formal schooling of any kind)
*Andrew Johnson (no formal schooling of any kind)
*Grover Cleveland
*William McKinley (attended Allegheny College, but did not graduate; also attended Albany Law School, but also did not graduate)
*Harry S. Truman (went to business college and law school, but did not graduate)

=== Undergraduate ===


====Additional undergraduate information====
Some presidents attended more than one institution. George Washington never attended college, though The College of William &amp; Mary did issue him a surveyor&#x27;s certificate. One president attended a foreign college at the undergraduate level: John Quincy Adams at Leiden University (John F. Kennedy intended to study at the London School of Economics, but failed to attend as he fell ill before classes began.) Bill Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship, enrolling at the University of Oxford in Fall 1968, where he read for a B.Phil in politics. He left Oxford without earning a degree in order to enroll at Yale Law School. 

Three presidents have attended the United States Service academies: Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D. Eisenhower graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, while Jimmy Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. No presidents have graduated from the United States Coast Guard Academy or the much newer U.S. Air Force Academy. Eisenhower also graduated from the Army Command and General Staff College, Army Industrial College and Army War College. These were not degree-granting institutions when Eisenhower attended, but were part of his professional education as a career soldier.

===Graduate school===
A total of 21 presidents attended some form of graduate school (including professional schools). Among them, eleven presidents received a graduate degree during their lifetimes; two more received graduate degrees posthumously.

====Business school====
==== Graduate school ====
==== Medical school ====

==== Law school ====

Several presidents who were lawyers did not attend law school, but became lawyers after independent study under the tutelage of established attorneys. Some had attended college before beginning their legal studies, and several studied law without first having attended college. Presidents who were lawyers but did not attend law school include: John Adams; Thomas Jefferson; James Madison; James Monroe; John Quincy Adams; Andrew Jackson; Martin Van Buren; John Tyler; James K. Polk; Millard Fillmore; James Buchanan; Abraham Lincoln; James A. Garfield; Grover Cleveland; Benjamin Harrison; and Calvin Coolidge.

Presidents who were admitted to the bar after a combination of law school and independent study include; Franklin Pierce; Chester A. Arthur; William McKinley; and Woodrow Wilson.

==List by graduate degree earned==
=== Ph.D. (research doctorate) ===
===M.B.A. (Master of Business Administration)===
===M.A. (Master of Arts)===
Note: John Adams and John Quincy Adams, along with George W. Bush are the only presidents to date to attain master&#x27;s degrees.

=== J.D. or LL.B. (law)===
Note: Hayes, Taft, Nixon and Ford were awarded LL.B. degrees. When most U.S. law schools began to award the J.D. as the professional degree in law during the 1960s, previous graduates had the choice of converting their LL.B. degrees to a J.D. Duke University Law School made the change in 1968, and Yale Law School in 1971.

<doc id="454305" wikidata="Q648280" url="?curid=454305" title="Mitsubishi Heavy Industries">
<text>is a Japanese multinational engineering, electrical equipment and electronics corporation headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. MHI is one of the core companies of the Mitsubishi Group and its automobile division is the predecessor of Mitsubishi Motors.

MHI&#x27;s products include aerospace and automotive components, air conditioners, elevators, forklift trucks, hydraulic equipment, printing machines, missiles, tanks, power systems, ships, aircraft, railway systems, and space launch vehicles. Through its defense-related activities, it is the world&#x27;s 23rd-largest defense contractor measured by 2011 defense revenues and the largest based in Japan.

==History==
In 1857, at the request of the Tokugawa Shogunate, a group of Dutch engineers were invited, including Dutch naval engineer Hendrik Hardes, and began work on the &quot;Nagasaki Yotetsusho&quot; (), a modern, Western-style foundry and shipyard near the Dutch settlement of Dejima, at Nagasaki. This was renamed &quot;Nagasaki Seitetsusho&quot; () Nagasaki Iron (Steel) Foundry in 1860, and construction was completed in 1861. Following the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the shipyard was placed under control of the new Government of Meiji Japan. The first dry dock was completed in 1879.

In 1884, Yataro Iwasaki, the founder of Mitsubishi, leased the &quot;Nagasaki Seitetsusho&quot; from the Japanese government, renamed it the &quot;Nagasaki Shipyard &amp; Machinery Works&quot; () and entered the shipbuilding business on a large scale. Iwasaki purchased the shipyards outright in 1887. In 1891, &quot;Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - Yokohama Machinery Works&quot; was started as &quot;Yokohama Dock Company, Ltd&quot;. Its main business was ship repairs, to which it added ship servicing by 1897. The works was renamed &quot;Mitsubishi Shipyard of Mitsubishi Goshi Kaisha&quot; in 1893 and additional dry docks were completed in 1896 and 1905.

The &quot;Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - Shimonoseki Shipyard &amp; Machinery Works&quot; was established in 1914. It produced industrial machinery and merchant ships.

The Nagasaki company was renamed &quot;Mitsubishi Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company, Ltd.&quot; in 1917 and again renamed as &quot;Mitsubishi Heavy Industries&quot; in 1934. It became the largest private firm in Japan, active in the manufacture of ships, heavy machinery, airplanes and railway cars. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries merged with the Yokohama Dock Company in 1935. From its inception, the Mitsubishi Nagasaki shipyards were heavily involved in contracts for the Imperial Japanese Navy. The largest battleship &quot;Musashi&quot; was completed at Nagasaki in 1942. These connections made Nagasaki a target for strategic bombing during World War II by the Allied air forces, which later dropped an atomic bomb on the city on August 9, 1945. This attack, following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima three days earlier, dealt a devastating blow to the Japanese leadership, contributing to the surrender of Japan six days later.

The &quot;Kobe Shipyard of Mitsubishi Goshi Kaisha&quot; was established in 1905. The Kobe Shipyard merged with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in 1934. The Kobe Shipyard constructed the ocean liner &quot;Argentina Maru&quot; (later repurposed as the aircraft carrier &quot;Kaiyo&quot;), and the submarines the &quot;I-19&quot; and &quot;I-25&quot;.

Following the dissolution of the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; after the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, Mitsubishi divided into three companies in January 1950: Mitsubishi Nagasaki became &quot;West Japan Heavy Industries, Ltd&quot;, the Kobe Shipyard became &quot;Central Japan Heavy-Industries, Ltd.&quot;, and the Yokohama branch became East Japan Heavy-Industries, Ltd. On 28 April 1952 the Occupation of Japan ended, which meant that the ban on using zaibatsu names was lifted. Accordingly, all three companies changed names again on 7 May 1952: West Japan Heavy Industries (the Nagasaki Shipyard) was renamed &quot;Mitsubishi Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Co., Ltd.&quot;, Central Japan Heavy Industries, Ltd. was renamed Shin-Mitsubishi Jukogyo K.K. (also trading as &quot;Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Reorganized, Ltd.&quot;; &quot;shin&quot; meaning &quot;New&quot;), while East Japan Heavy-Industries became Mitsubishi Nippon Heavy Industries.

In 1964, the three independent companies from the 1950 break-up were merged into Shin-Mitsubishi Jukogyo and became Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. The Nagasaki works was renamed the &quot;Nagasaki Shipyard &amp; Engine Works&quot;. The Kobe works was renamed the &#x27;Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - Kobe Shipyard &amp; Machinery Works&#x27;.

In 1970, MHI&#x27;s automobile parts department became an independent company as Mitsubishi Motors.

In 1974, its Tokyo headquarters was targeted in a bombing that killed eight people.

MHI participated in a ¥540 billion emergency rescue of Mitsubishi Motors in January 2005, in partnership with Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group. As part of the rescue, MHI acquired ¥50 billion of Mitsubishi Motors stock, increasing its ownership stake to 15 percent and making the automaker an affiliate again. The emergency rescue was carried out 4 years after a product recall scandal in Japan that was triggered by accusations of Mitsubishi Motors allegedly trying to systematically hide manufacturing defects to avoid recalls, and marketing problems in the US.

In 1994, MHI opened the Mitsubishi Minatomirai Industrial Museum in Yokohama which is mainly a museum for kids to experience science and technology.

In October 2009, MHI announced an order for up to 100 regional jets from the United States–based airline Trans States Holdings.

MHI entered talks with Hitachi in August 2011 about a potential merger of the two companies, in what would have been the largest merger between two Japanese companies in history. The talks subsequently broke down and were suspended.

In November 2012, MHI and Hitachi agreed to merge their thermal power generation businesses into a joint venture to be owned 65% by MHI and 35% by Hitachi. The joint venture began operations in February 2014 and ended in 2020, as Hitachi transferred its shares to MHI.

In June 2014 Siemens and MHI announced their formation of joint ventures to bid for Alstom&#x27;s troubled energy and transportation businesses (in locomotives, steam turbines, and aircraft engines). A rival bid by General Electric (GE) has been criticized by French government sources, who consider Alstom&#x27;s operations as a &quot;vital national interest&quot; at a moment when the French unemployment level stands above 10% and some voters are turning towards the conservative party. GE&#x27;s proposal ultimately prevailed.

MHI had entered the high-speed train business in 1995, with the manufacture of the MLX01 SCMaglev car, a business it exited in 2017 after struggling with the development costs of the Mitsubishi SpaceJet, and disagreements with Central Japan Railway Company over the manufacturing costs of the SCMaglev cars.

In February 2021, MHI sold its machine tools business MHI Machine Tool Co. to Nidec.

In June 2024, MHI announced it will cease newspaper rotary printing press production due to declining demand. At the time the company held a 50% share of the Japanese rotary press market.

==Operations==

===Aerospace===
MHI has aerospace facilities in Nagoya, Aichi, Komaki, Aichi and Mississauga, Canada.

In the 1950s the company began to re-enter the aerospace industry in earnest. Along with other major Japanese companies it was involved in design and production of the NAMC YS-11, the first Japanese airliner to enter production after World War II. In 1956 work started on the design of the Mitsubishi MU-2, which became the company&#x27;s first postwar aircraft design.

In the defense sector, MHI has produced jet fighters for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force and anti-submarine helicopters for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, as well as aero-engines, missiles and torpedoes. It produced North American F-86 Sabre, Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II fighters. It manufactured 139 Mitsubishi F-15J fighter aircraft from 1981 and produced 200 Sikorsky S-70 family Mitsubishi H-60 helicopters from 1989, in both cases under license production. The company also plays an important role in the Japanese Ballistic Missile Defense System program.

In the space systems sector, MHI is the producer of the H-IIA and H-IIB launch vehicles, Japan&#x27;s main rockets, and provides launch services for national institutions and companies around the world. The clients include JAXA, KARI, Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre, and Inmarsat. The company is also involved in the International Space Station program as a cargo spaceship contractor.

On 1 April 2008, MHI established Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation as a subsidiary to develop and produce the MRJ or Mitsubishi Regional Jet, a 70 to 90 passenger regional airliner. MHI is the majority shareholder of the new company, with Toyota Motor Corporation owning 10%.

On December 12, 2012, MHI acquired Pratt &amp; Whitney Power Systems, the small gas turbine business of United Technologies.

In the civil aircraft sector, MHI develops and manufactures major airframe components, including fuselage panels for the Boeing 777 and composite-material wing boxes for the 787. In June 2014, the company joined four other major Japanese companies in signing an agreement to build parts for Boeing&#x27;s 777X aircraft.

On 25 June 2019, MHI announced the acquisition of Bombardier Aviation&#x27;s CRJ programme, in a deal expected to close in the first half of 2020, subject to regulatory approval. MHI will benefit from Bombardier&#x27;s global expertise in areas ranging from engineering and certification to customer relations and support, boosting its SpaceJet (formerly MRJ) programme, and potentially enabling the SpaceJet to be produced in North America. The deal includes two service centres in Canada and two in the US, as well as the type certificates for the CRJ. Bombardier will retain its assembly facility at Mirabel, near Montreal, Canada, and will continue to produce the CRJ on behalf of MHI until the current order backlog is complete. In early May 2020, MHI confirmed that all conditions had been met and that the transaction would be closed on 1 June. The acquired aviation unit was then renamed MHI RJ Aviation Group.

MHI recorded a loss in FY 2020 partly because of the continuous delays of the first delivery of the SpaceJet. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic that crippled the aviation industry, MHI decided to put a halt to the project.

===Defense===
In 2010, MHI commenced production of the Type 10 advanced main battle tank, at a cost of $11.3 million per unit, to replace the Type 90 tank.

===Energy===
The nuclear business of MHI operates facilities in the cities of Kobe and Takasago in Hyogo Prefecture and in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture. It also operates a nuclear fuel manufacturing plant in Tōkai, Ibaraki which processes 440 metric tons of Uranium per year.

MHI has also developed the Mitsubishi APWR design. MHI has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Areva for the establishment of a joint venture, Atmea, for their next reactor design ATMEA1.

MHI has also been selected as the core company to develop a new generation of Fast Breeder Reactors (FBR) by the Japanese government. After that announcement was made, MHI established a new company, Mitsubishi FBR Systems, Inc. (MFBR) specifically for the development and realization of FBR technology, starting what is likely to be the most aggressive corporate venture into FBR and Generation IV reactor technology.

As of 2015, MHI was developing a $15.8 billion nuclear power plant in Sinop, Turkey in partnership with Itochu and Engie, which would be its first overseas nuclear project. The deal has been officially scrapped in January 2020, after the feasibility of the project was doubted.

MHI unsuccessfully attempted to acquire the energy business of Alstom in 2014 in order to develop its service network in Southeast Asia. MHI remains interested in acquisitions in the crude oil and gas sectors as of 2015. Following financial difficulties at Areva, MHI announced in 2015 it would make a proposal to take a minority ownership stake in a new entity called inheriting Areva&#x27;s nuclear reactor business and acquired a 19% stake in the entity in 2017. In 2018, the entity has been named Framatome.

In 2020, MHI eventually acquired Hitachi&#x27;s gas turbine business unit after the two companies had merged their businesses to form a joint venture.

===Shipbuilding===
Shipbuilding has been a core and historical founding activity for MHI. It was formally started in 1884 when Mitsubishi leased and then acquired the &#x27;Nagasaki Shipyard &amp; Machinery Works&#x27; company (founded in 1857 as &#x27;Nagasaki Yotetsusho Foundry&#x27;). Subsequently, Mitsubishi progressively became one of the major Japanese shipbuilding companies, building both commercial as well as military ships, including the Yamato-class battleship, Musashi, of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II.

MHI has shipbuilding facilities in Nagasaki, Kobe and Shimonoseki, Japan. is the primary shipbuilding division of MHI. It primarily produces specialized commercial vessels, including LNG carriers, and passenger cruise ships.

On 1 December 2017, MHI announced that it will launch two new wholly owned companies on 1 January 2018 in conjunction with reorganization of its shipbuilding business:

* A new subsidiary, Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Co., Ltd., was created to primarily undertake construction of ships that require intensive outfitting and advanced technologies, mainly based on the Yokohama, Shimonoseki and Nagasaki shipyards.
* Separately, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Marine Structure Co., Ltd. will mainly engage in the manufacture of large ships and marine structures.
In late 2019, MHI, exploring a withdrawal from LNG carrier construction, started to negotiate with Oshima Shipbuilding to divest its historic shipyard located in Koyagi, Nagasaki.

On 24 December 2019, Mitsubishi Shipbuilding delivered its first fuel gas supply system for a marine LNG engine.

In June 2020, MHI entered talks with Mitsui Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding to acquire the latter&#x27;s naval and patrol ship business. The deal would strengthen MHI&#x27;s defense sector, effectively consolidating Japan&#x27;s defense industry as well. The deal is expected to be reached by the end of 2020, with the parties closing the transaction by October 2021, if approved by regulators.

On January 17, 2022, the first successful sea voyage of an unmanned, fully autonomous vessel was successfully carried out by the &quot;Soleil&quot;, built by MHI. The demonstration, conducted in cooperation of Shin Nihonkai Ferry, sailed 240 kilometres, from Shinmoji in Northern Kyushu, to the Iyonada Sea, over seven hours, with a maximum speed of 26 knots.

In the LIMA 2023 convention, MHI unveiled the Multi-Role Support Ship concept for visitors.

MHI reported on February 26, 2025 that Australian operations will be expanded as part of efforts to secure potential contracts for the Mogami-class ships to enter Australian service.

===Wind power===
MHI has installed more 3,282 MW worldwide until December 2009, mainly turbines with 1 and 2.4 MW. The company is developing 7-MW-turbines for offshore wind power. Tests are planned for 2013 in Europe.

On September 27, 2013, MHI and Vestas Wind Systems announced a joint-venture named MHI Vestas Offshore Wind to develop offshore wind energy based on Vestas&#x27; V164 8.0MW turbine. In 2020, MHI acquired 2.5% of Vestas by transferring its 50% of MHI Vestas to Vestas, and receiving 5 million new Vestas shares.

==Controversies==

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries apologized and compensated victims of Chinese forced labor by Japan during World War II in 2015. Yonhap News Agency criticized Mitsubishi for rescuing Chinese victims while turning a blind eye to Korean victims.

On November 28, 2018, MHI was ordered by the South Korea Supreme Court to pay 150 million won ($133,000; £104,000) in compensation to 10 surviving Koreans who were victims of forced labor which the company oversaw during the Japanese occupation of Korea. Eighteen family members of other victims of the forced labour overseen by MHI, who had previously sued sometime before 2008, were now able to receive the compensation as well by the decision. All twenty-eight plaintiffs had previously filed a lawsuit in Japan, but had their lawsuit dismissed by the Supreme Court of Japan in 2008.

The Japanese government has officially disputed the lawsuit and defined the verdict as &quot;a breach of the international law&quot;, citing the 1965 agreement which was made by the two nations to establish diplomatic relations, since all of the &quot;problems concerning property, rights, and interests&quot; that had been existed between the two countries and respective peoples thereof during the occupation era &quot;have been settled completely and finally&quot;.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, MHI refused to join the international community and withdraw from the Russian market. Research from Yale University updated on April 28, 2022 identifying how companies were reacting to Russia&#x27;s invasion identified MHI as one of the companies &quot;defying demands for exit/reduction of activities&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, the Plancherel theorem (sometimes called the Parseval–Plancherel identity) is a result in harmonic analysis, proven by Michel Plancherel in 1910. It is a generalization of Parseval&#x27;s theorem; often used in the fields of science and engineering, proving the unitarity of the Fourier transform.

The theorem states that the integral of a function&#x27;s squared modulus is equal to the integral of the squared modulus of its frequency spectrum. That is, if formula_1 is a function on the real line, and formula_2 is its frequency spectrum, then
A more precise formulation is that if a function is in both &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; spaces formula_3 and formula_4, then its Fourier transform is in formula_4 and the Fourier transform is an isometry with respect to the &quot;L&quot;2 norm. This implies that the Fourier transform restricted to formula_6 has a unique extension to a linear isometric map formula_7, sometimes called the Plancherel transform. This isometry is actually a unitary map. In effect, this makes it possible to speak of Fourier transforms of quadratically integrable functions.

A proof of the theorem is available from &quot;Rudin (1987, Chapter 9)&quot;. The basic idea is to prove it for Gaussian distributions, and then use density. But a standard Gaussian is transformed to itself under the Fourier transformation, and the theorem is trivial in that case. Finally, the standard transformation properties of the Fourier transform then imply Plancherel for all Gaussians.

Plancherel&#x27;s theorem remains valid as stated on &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space formula_8. The theorem also holds more generally in locally compact abelian groups. There is also a version of the Plancherel theorem which makes sense for non-commutative locally compact groups satisfying certain technical assumptions. This is the subject of non-commutative harmonic analysis.

Due to the polarization identity, one can also apply Plancherel&#x27;s theorem to the formula_4 inner product of two functions. That is, if formula_10 and formula_11 are two formula_4 functions, and formula_13 denotes the Plancherel transform, then
formula_14
and if formula_10 and formula_11 are furthermore formula_3 functions, then 
formula_18
and 
formula_19
so
==Locally compact groups==
There is also a Plancherel theorem for the Fourier transform in locally compact groups. In the case of an abelian group formula_20, there is a Pontryagin dual group formula_21 of characters on formula_20. Given a Haar measure on formula_20, the Fourier transform of a function in formula_24 is 
formula_25
for formula_26 a character on formula_20.

The Plancherel theorem states that there is a Haar measure on formula_21, the &quot;dual measure&quot; such that
formula_29
for all formula_30 (and the Fourier transform is also in formula_31).

The theorem also holds in many non-abelian locally compact groups, except that the set of irreducible unitary representations formula_21 may not be a group. For example, when formula_20 is a finite group, formula_21 is the set of irreducible characters. From basic character theory, if formula_35 is a class function, we have the Parseval formula
formula_29
formula_37
More generally, when formula_35 is not a class function, the norm is
formula_39
so the Plancherel measure weights each representation by its dimension.

In full generality, a Plancherel theorem is
formula_40
where the norm is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the operator
formula_41
and the measure formula_42, if one exists, is called the Plancherel measure.

<doc id="454321" wikidata="Q547031" url="?curid=454321" title="Steve Keen">
<text>Steve Keen (born 28 March 1953) is an Australian economist and author. He considers himself a post-Keynesian, criticising neoclassical economics as inconsistent, unscientific, and empirically unsupported.

Keen was formerly an associate professor of economics at University of Western Sydney, until he applied for voluntary redundancy in 2013, due to the closure of the economics program at the university. In 2014, he became a professor and Head of the School of Economics, History and Politics at Kingston University in London. He has since taken retirement and is crowd source funded to undertake independent research as well as being a Distinguished Research Fellow at the Institute for Strategy Resilience &amp; Security, University College London.

==Early life and education==
Keen was born in Sydney in 1953. His father was a bank manager. Keen graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1974 and a Bachelor of Laws in 1976, both from the University of Sydney. He then completed a Diploma of Education at the Sydney Teachers College in 1977.

In 1990, he completed a Master of Commerce in economics and economic history at the University of New South Wales. He completed his PhD in economics at the University of New South Wales in 1997.

==Economics==
===Financial instability and debt deflation===
Most of Steve Keen&#x27;s recent work focuses on modeling Hyman Minsky&#x27;s financial instability hypothesis and Irving Fisher&#x27;s debt deflation. The hypothesis predicts that an overly large private debt to GDP ratio can cause deflation and depression. Here, the falling of the price level results in a continually rising real quantity of outstanding debt. Moreover, the continued deleveraging of outstanding debts increases the rate of deflation. Thus, debt and deflation act on and react to one another, resulting in a debt-deflation spiral. The outcome is a depression.

===&quot;Debunking Economics&quot;===
Keen&#x27;s full-range critique of neoclassical economics is contained in his book &quot;Debunking Economics&quot;. Keen presents a wide variety of critiques on neoclassical economic theory. He argues they show neoclassical assumptions which are fundamentally flawed. Keen claims several neoclassical assumptions are empirically unsupported (that is, they are unsupported by observable and repeatable phenomena) nor are they desirable for society at large (that is, they do not necessarily produce either efficiency or equity for the majority). He argues economists&#x27; overall conclusions are very sensitive to small changes in these assumptions.

Keen has attempted to counter Karl Marx&#x27;s theory (in his view Marx&#x27;s pre-1857 view, specifically) from a post-Keynesian perspective, by arguing machines can add more product-value over their operational lifetime than the total value of depreciation charged &quot;during those asset lives&quot;. 

For example, the total value of sausages produced by a sausage machine over its useful life might be greater than the value of the machine. Depreciation, he implies, was the weak point in Marx&#x27;s social accounting system all along. Keen argues all factors of production can add new value to outputs. However he gives credit to Marx for contributing to the &quot;financial instability hypothesis&quot; of Hyman Minsky.

Keen&#x27;s book closes with a survey of various schools of heterodox economics, concluding &quot;None of these is at present strong enough or complete enough to declare itself a contender for the title of &#x27;the&#x27; economic theory of the 21st century.&quot; However, he argues neoclassical economics is a degenerative research program, not generating new knowledge. It primarily grows a belt of protective auxiliary hypotheses to shield its core beliefs from critique. There is an accompanying website which provides more detailed mathematical expositions.

=== Critique of neoclassical theory of the firm ===
Keen has challenged the core, elementary textbook neoclassical theories of Perfect competition and Monopoly, and in particular the argument that firms in &quot;perfect competition&quot; and monopolies are usefully thought of as representing polar opposites. Keen has referred to this as &quot;the theory of the firm.&quot;

Neoclassical textbooks define a firm acting without any strategic awareness of the effect of its output choice on price as representing &quot;perfect competition&quot; and argue that this condition of &quot;perfect competition&quot; can be represented analytically by a horizontal demand curve facing the firm -- the firm acts as if it believes it can sell whatever it produces at the currently prevailing price, but nothing at any higher price; marginal costs for this firm, it is presumed, are rising and the firm does not want to sell more at the current price or a lower price. Something like such a state of affairs, it is sometimes argued, is approached as the number of firms competing in a market approaches infinity and the effect of any one firm&#x27;s output decision on the overall market price becomes infinitesimal and can be practically disregarded by the individual firm in its decision-making.

By contrast a firm with strategic awareness that its output decision markedly affects the market price, faces, presumptively, a downward-sloping demand curve: expanding the rate of output sold depresses market price. In general, elementary neoclassical textbook presentations hold that all &quot;profit-maximizing&quot; firms will set marginal revenue equal to marginal cost. For the firm in &quot;perfect competition&quot;, this means price = marginal revenue = marginal cost = average (unit) cost and no profit. For the &quot;monopoly&quot; firm aware that its output choice affects price, the &quot;profit-maximizing&quot; choice is to choose a rate of output where marginal cost = marginal revenue, but in the monopolist&#x27;s case, that will mean constraining output to raise price above marginal cost. 

Keen challenges the theory and pedagogy of &quot;perfect competition&quot; and &quot;monopoly&quot; as polar opposites from multiple angles, arguing that they are contradictory and incoherent taken as a whole. He shows that the number of firms in a market is practically irrelevant to whether the firm&#x27;s output choice affects the overall market price in the simplified (and practically unlikely) case of uniform firm cost structures and a downward-sloping market demand curve. He goes on to explore various scenarios by which multiple firms might arrive at an &quot;equilibrium&quot; market price and level of output. Keen further notes that cost structures are rarely uniform and that in the presence of significant economies from scale of production, a so-called &quot;monopoly&quot; realizing such economies of scale would be led to higher output and lower price than a large number of competing firms unable to realise such economies of scale. Keen also takes note of empirical evidence that many actual business firms are producing in a range of output where marginal cost may be less than average cost and falling, and firms openly desire to produce and sell more at current prices.

Keen&#x27;s article on &quot;profit maximisation, industry structure, and competition&quot; has had counter-arguments by Paul Anglin. Chris Auld has additionally claimed to show that Keen &amp; Standish&#x27;s arguments are inconsistent with standard assumptions used in perfect competition, and their analysis uses calculus improperly.

=== Climate change ===
Keen criticises the economics of climate change generally and the 2018 work by Nordhaus in particular: &quot;economists made their own predictions of damages, using three spurious methods: assuming that about 90% of GDP will be unaffected by climate change, because it happens indoors; using the relationship between temperature and GDP today as a proxy for the impact of global warming over time; and using surveys that diluted extreme warnings from scientists with optimistic expectations from economists.&quot; For example, indoor activities can be disrupted by extreme weather (eg Hurricane Sandy). Keen also argues that regressions of the GSP of states in the US to average temperature are flawed as the states have similar per capita income, that other factors are more important to GSP rather than average temperature, and that assuming the weak correlation found would continue to hold true with further global warming is begging the question.

When specifically speaking about Nordhaus, he says that &quot;Nordhaus has misrepresented the scientific literature to justify the using a smooth function to describe the damage to GDP from climate change. Correcting for these errors makes it feasible that the economic damages from climate change are at least an order of magnitude worse than forecast by economists, and may be so great as to threaten the survival of human civilization.&quot;

===Politics===
In August 2015, Keen endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. Keen ran as a senate candidate for The New Liberals in New South Wales during the 2022 Australian federal election.

==== Views on the UK&#x27;s EU referendum ====
Keen was in favour of the UK leaving the European Union, stating mainstream economists were over-certain and exaggerating the likely effects following the country&#x27;s withdrawal. Keen regards the open-borders free-movement policy of the EU as precipitate and unsustainable in the absence of a common fiscal policy; all the more so, given how migrants impose burdens on public services in destination countries also experiencing austerity. 

He also states the Euro is destined to fail, not least because of the way it penalises recession-hit countries unable to pursue expansive fiscal policy, and indeed considers the whole EU project as a failed one destined for collapse.

==&quot;Minsky&quot; software project==
Recently, Keen commissioned the development of a software package called &quot;Minsky&quot; for visually modelling national economies, in a way that is intended to be more accurate than mainstream macroeconomic models – which he contends do not properly include debt and banking. He envisages it being used for both educational and research purposes.

The first phase of the development was funded by an academic research grant, as is typical for academic research projects – but in February 2013 Keen launched a crowdfunding project on Kickstarter to allow members of the public to contribute towards taking MINSKY to the next level of development. In the first 24 hours, this project raised approximately 15% of its funding target, and has since fully achieved its initial funding goal of $50,000.00.

==Criticism==
Economist Chris Auld argues that Keen&#x27;s criticism of the basic model of perfect competition makes basic mathematical errors.

Matthijs Krul maintains that Keen, while broadly accurate in his criticism of the neoclassical synthesis, generally misrepresents Marx&#x27;s views in &quot;Debunking Economics&quot; and in earlier work when asserting that, in the production of commodities, machinery produces more value than it costs.

Austrian School economists Robert P. Murphy and Gene Callahan claim Keen&#x27;s 2001 book &quot;suffers from many of the very faults of which he accuses the mainstream&quot;. They also claim that much of his work is &quot;ideologically motivated even while criticising neoclassical economics for being ideological&quot;. They praise his critique of perfect competition and his chapter on dynamic vs. static models, whilst they criticise his attempts at objective value theory and what they claim is his misrepresentation of the Austrian School interpretation of Say&#x27;s law.

<text>An anonymous P2P communication system is a peer-to-peer distributed application in which the nodes, which are used to share resources, or participants are anonymous or pseudonymous. Anonymity of participants is usually achieved by special routing overlay networks that hide the physical location of each node from other participants.

Interest in anonymous P2P systems has increased in recent years for many reasons, ranging from the desire to share files without revealing one&#x27;s network identity and risking litigation to distrust in governments, concerns over mass surveillance and data retention, and lawsuits against bloggers.

==Motivation for anonymity==
There are many reasons to use anonymous P2P technology; most of them are generic to all forms of online anonymity.

P2P users who desire anonymity usually do so as they do not wish to be identified as a publisher (sender), or reader (receiver), of information. Common reasons include:
* Censorship at the local, organizational, or national level
* Personal privacy preferences such as preventing tracking or data mining activities
* The material or its distribution is considered illegal or incriminating by possible eavesdroppers
* Material is legal but socially deplored, embarrassing or problematic in the individual&#x27;s social world
* Fear of retribution (against whistleblowers, unofficial leaks, and activists who do not believe in restrictions on information nor knowledge)

A particularly open view on legal and illegal content is given in The Philosophy Behind Freenet.

Governments are also interested in anonymous P2P technology. The United States Navy funded the original onion routing research that led to the development of the Tor network, which was later funded by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and is now developed by the non-profit organization The Tor Project, Inc.

==Arguments for and against anonymous P2P communication==

===General===
While anonymous P2P systems may support the protection of unpopular speech, they may also protect illegal activities, such as fraud, libel, the exchange of illegal pornography, the unauthorized copying of copyrighted works, or the planning of criminal activities. Critics of anonymous P2P systems hold that these disadvantages outweigh the advantages offered by such systems, and that other communication channels are already sufficient for unpopular speech.

Proponents of anonymous P2P systems believe that all restrictions on free speech serve authoritarian interests, information itself is ethically neutral, and that it is the people acting upon the information that can be good or evil. Perceptions of good and evil can also change (see moral panic); for example, if anonymous peer-to-peer networks had existed in the 1950s or 1960s, they might have been targeted for carrying information about civil rights or anarchism.

Easily accessible anonymous P2P networks are seen by some as a democratization of encryption technology, giving the general populace access to secure communications channels already used by governments. Supporters of this view, such as Phil Zimmermann, argue that anti-surveillance technologies help to equalize power between governments and their people, which is the actual reason for banning them. John Pilger opines that monitoring of the populace helps to contain threats to the &quot;consensual view of established authority&quot; or threats to the continuity of power structures and privilege.

===Freedom of speech===
Some claim that true freedom of speech, especially on controversial subjects, is difficult or impossible unless individuals can speak anonymously. If anonymity is not possible, one could be subjected to threats or reprisals for voicing an unpopular view. This is one reason why voting is done by secret ballot in many democracies. Controversial information which a party wants to keep hidden, such as details about corruption issues, is often published or leaked anonymously.

====Anonymous blogging====

Anonymous blogging is one widespread use of anonymous networks. While anonymous blogging is possible on the non-anonymous internet to some degree too, a provider hosting the blog in question might be forced to disclose the blogger&#x27;s IP address (as when Google revealed an anonymous blogger&#x27;s identity). Anonymous networks provide a better degree of anonymity. Flogs (anonymous blogs) in Freenet, Syndie and other blogging tools in I2P and Osiris sps are some examples of anonymous blogging technologies.

One argument for anonymous blogging is a delicate nature of work situation. Sometimes a blogger writing under their real name faces a choice between either staying silent or causing a harm to themselves, their colleagues or the company they work for.

Another reason is risk of lawsuits. Some bloggers have faced multimillion-dollar lawsuits (although they were later dropped completely); anonymous blogging provides protection against such risks.

====Censorship via Internet domain names====
On the non-anonymous Internet, a domain name like &quot;example.com&quot; is a key to accessing information. The censorship of the Wikileaks website shows that domain names are extremely vulnerable to censorship. Some domain registrars have suspended customers&#x27; domain names even in the absence of a court order.

For the affected customer, blocking of a domain name is a far bigger problem than a registrar refusing to provide a service; typically, the registrar keeps full control of the domain names in question. In the case of a European travel agency, more than 80 .com websites were shut down without any court process and held by the registrar since then. The travel agency had to rebuild the sites under the .net top-level domain instead.

On the other hand, anonymous networks do not rely on domain name registrars. For example, Freenet, I2P and Tor hidden services implement censorship-resistant URLs based on public-key cryptography: only a person having the correct private key can update the URL or take it down.

===Control over online tracking===
Anonymous P2P also has value in normal daily communication. When communication is anonymous, the decision to reveal the identities of the communicating parties is left up to the parties involved and is not available to a third party. Often there is no need or desire by the communicating parties to reveal their identities. As a matter of personal freedom, many people do not want processes in place by default which supply unnecessary data. In some cases, such data could be compiled into histories of their activities.

For example, most current phone systems transmit caller ID information by default to the called party (although this can be disabled either for a single call or for all calls). If a person calls to make an inquiry about a product or the time of a movie, the party called has a record of the calling phone number, and may be able to obtain the name, address and other information about the caller. This information is not available about someone who walks into a store and makes a similar inquiry.

===Effects of surveillance on lawful activity===
Online surveillance, such as recording and retaining details of web and e-mail traffic, may have effects on lawful activities. People may be deterred from accessing or communicating legal information because they know of possible surveillance and believe that such communication may be seen as suspicious. According to law professor Daniel J. Solove, such effects &quot;harm society because, among other things, they reduce the range of viewpoints being expressed and the degree of freedom with which to engage in political activity.&quot;

===Access to censored and copyrighted material===
Most countries ban or censor the publication of certain books and movies, and certain types of content. Other material is legal to possess but not to distribute; for example, copyright and software patent laws may forbid its distribution. These laws are difficult or impossible to enforce in anonymous P2P networks.

===Anonymous online money===
With anonymous money, it becomes possible to arrange anonymous markets where one can buy and sell just about anything anonymously. Anonymous money could be used to avoid tax collection. However, any transfer of physical goods between two parties could compromise anonymity.

Proponents argue that conventional cash provides a similar kind of anonymity, and that existing laws are adequate to combat crimes like tax evasion that might result from the use of anonymous cash, whether online or offline.

==Functioning of anonymous P2P==

===Anonymity and pseudonymity===
Some of the networks commonly referred to as &quot;anonymous P2P&quot; are truly anonymous, in the sense that network nodes carry no identifiers. Others are actually pseudonymous: instead of being identified by their IP addresses, nodes are identified by pseudonyms such as cryptographic keys. For example, each node in the MUTE network has an overlay address that is derived from its public key. This overlay address functions as a pseudonym for the node, allowing messages to be addressed to it. In Freenet, on the other hand, messages are routed using keys that identify specific pieces of data rather than specific nodes; the nodes themselves are anonymous.

The term &quot;anonymous&quot; is used to describe both kinds of network because it is difficult—if not impossible—to determine whether a node that sends a message originated the message or is simply forwarding it on behalf of another node. Every node in an anonymous P2P network acts as a universal sender and universal receiver to maintain anonymity. If a node was only a receiver and did not send, then neighbouring nodes would know that the information it was requesting was for itself only, removing any plausible deniability that it was the recipient (and consumer) of the information. Thus, in order to remain anonymous, nodes must ferry information for others on the network.

===Spam and DoS attacks in anonymous networks===
Originally, anonymous networks were operated by small and friendly communities of developers. As interest in anonymous P2P increased and the user base grew, malicious users inevitably appeared and tried different attacks. This is similar to the Internet, where widespread use has been followed by waves of spam and distributed DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. Such attacks may require different solutions in anonymous networks. For example, blacklisting of originator network addresses does not work because anonymous networks conceal this information. These networks are more vulnerable to DoS attacks as well due to the smaller bandwidth, as has been shown in examples on the Tor network.

A conspiracy to attack an anonymous network could be considered criminal computer hacking, though the nature of the network makes this impossible to prosecute without compromising the anonymity of data in the network.

==Opennet and darknet network types==

Like conventional P2P networks, anonymous P2P networks can implement either opennet or darknet (often named friend-to-friend) network type. This describes how a node on the network selects peer nodes:

* In opennet network, peer nodes are discovered automatically. There is no configuration required but little control available over which nodes become peers.
* In a darknet network, users manually establish connections with nodes run by people they know. Darknet typically needs more effort to set up but a node only has trusted nodes as peers.

Some networks like Freenet support both network types simultaneously (a node can have some manually added darknet peer nodes and some automatically selected opennet peers) .

In a friend-to-friend (or F2F) network, users only make direct connections with people they know. Many F2F networks support indirect anonymous or pseudonymous communication between users who do not know or trust one another. For example, a node in a friend-to-friend overlay can automatically forward a file (or a request for a file) anonymously between two &quot;friends&quot;, without telling either of them the other&#x27;s name or IP address. These &quot;friends&quot; can in turn forward the same file (or request) to their own &quot;friends&quot;, and so on. Users in a friend-to-friend network cannot find out who else is participating beyond their own circle of friends, so F2F networks can grow in size without compromising their users&#x27; anonymity.

Some friend-to-friend networks allow the user to control what kind of files can be exchanged with &quot;friends&quot; within the node, in order to stop them from exchanging files that user disapproves of.

Advantages and disadvantages of opennet compared to darknet are disputed, see friend-to-friend article for summary.

==List of anonymous P2P networks and clients==


===Public P2P clients===
* Classified-ads - an open source DHT-based decentralized messaging and voice app. Allows users to not expose any personal details but does not hide network addresses of nodes.
* DarkMX - a file-sharing client modeled on WinMX/Tixati with a built-in implementation of Tor.
* DigitalNote XDN - an open-source anonymous decentralized encrypted messaging system based on blockchain technology
* Freenet - a censorship-resistant distributed file system for anonymous publishing (open source, written in Java)
* GNUnet - a P2P framework, includes anonymous file sharing as its primary application (GNU Project, written in C, alpha status)
* Perfect Dark - a Japanese file-sharing client based on a distributed data store. One can see the IP address of connected nodes, but not what they are up or downloading. Amoeba is a similar client/network.
* Tribler - an open source BitTorrent client. It can be set to have neighboring nodes act as proxies between one&#x27;s client and the torrent swarm. The proxy can see what file is being uploaded, but most nodes in the swarm only see the exit node.
* ZeroNet - a decentralized Internet-like network of peer-to-peer users. Allows tunneling of HTTP-traffic through Tor.

====I2P clients====
* I2P - a fully decentralized overlay network for strong anonymity and end-to-end encryption, with many applications (P2P, browsing, distributed anonymous e-mail, instant messaging, IRC, ...) running on top of it (free/open source, platform-independent)
* I2P-Bote an anonymous, secure (end-to-end encrypted), serverless mail application with remailer functionality for the I2P network
* I2P-Messenger an anonymous, secure (end-to-end encrypted), serverless instant messenger for the I2P network
* I2PSnark - an anonymous BitTorrent client for the I2P network
* I2Phex - a Gnutella client which communicates anonymously through I2P
* iMule - an aMule port running under I2P network
* Robert (P2P Software) - another anonymous BitTorrent client for the I2P network
* I2P-Tahoe-LAFS - a censorship-resistant distributed file system for anonymous publishing and file sharing (open source, written in Python, pre-alpha status)
* Vuze (formerly Azureus) - a BitTorrent client with the option of using I2P or Tor (initially open source, written in Java)
* BiglyBT - a successor to Vuze. A BitTorrent client where downloads can be routed through I2P, and searches carried out through Tor (open source, written in Java)
* MuWire - is a filesharing software, with chat rooms. Even if running inside the I2P network, it is not called a &#x27;I2P client&#x27; because it has a I2P router embedded, so this makes it a standalone software. The project got shut down on 14 February 2023 but recently it seemingly got unarchived on Github, the developer said that it is possible to import connections from a .txt file for MuWire to work, which is now provided in the releases.

====Defunct (Public P2P clients) or no longer developed====
* Bitblinder (2009–2010) - file sharing
* Bitmessage - an anonymous decentralized messaging system serving as a secure replacement for email
* Cashmere (2005) - resilient anonymous routing
* Entropy (2003–2005) - Freenet compatible
* EarthStation 5 (2003–2005) - anonymity controverted
* Herbivore (2003–2005) - file sharing and messaging. Used the Dining cryptographers problem.
* MUTE (2003–2009) - file sharing
* NeoLoader - a filesharing software compatible with bittorrent and edonkey2000. Anonymous when used with the &quot;NeoShare&quot; feature (that use the proprietary &quot;NeoKad&quot; network)
* Netsukuku - a peer-to-peer routing system aiming to build a free and independent Internet
* Nodezilla (2004–2010) - an anonymizing, closed source network layer upon which applications can be built
* Osiris (Serverless Portal System) - an anonymous and distributed web portals creator.
* OFF System (2006–2010) - a P2P distributed file system through which all shared files are represented by randomized data blocks
* RShare (2006–2007) - file sharing
* Share - a Japanese filesharing client modeled on Winny
* Syndie - a content (mainly forums) syndication program that operates over numerous anonymous and non-anonymous networks (open source, written in Java)
* StealthNet (2007–2011) - the successor to RShare
* Winny - a Japanese filesharing program modeled on Freenet which relies on a mixnet and distributed datastore to provide anonymity

===Private P2P clients===
Private P2P networks are P2P networks that only allow some mutually trusted computers to share files. This can be achieved by using a central server or hub to authenticate clients, in which case the functionality is similar to a private FTP server, but with files transferred directly between the clients. Alternatively, users can exchange passwords or keys with their friends to form a decentralized network.

Examples include:
* Syncthing - is a free, open-source peer-to-peer file synchronization application. It can sync files between devices. Data security and data safety are built into the design of the software.
* Resilio Sync - a proprietary alternative to Syncthing

===Private F2F (friend-to-friend) clients===
Friend-to-friend networks are P2P networks that allows users only to make direct connections with people they know. Passwords or digital signatures can be used for authentication.

Examples include :
* Filetopia - not anonymous but encrypted friend-to-friend. File sharing, chat, internal mail service
* OneSwarm - a backwards compatible BitTorrent client with privacy-preserving sharing options, aims to create a large F2F network.
* Retroshare - filesharing, serverless email, instant messaging, VoIP, chatrooms, and decentralized forums.

===Hypothetical or defunct networks===

====Hypothetical====
The following networks only exist as design or are in development
* anoNet - extensible IP anonymizer with steganography support (in development)
* Crowds - Reiter and Rubin&#x27;s system for &quot;blending into a crowd&quot; has a known attack
* P2PRIV - Peer-to-Peer diRect and anonymous dIstribution oVerlay - anonymity via virtual links parallelization - currently in development and has significant, unsolved problems in a real world environment
* Phantom Anonymity Protocol - a fully decentralized high-throughput anonymization network (no longer in development)
* Race (Resilient Anonymous Communication for Everyone) - A project by DARPA to build an anonymous, attack-resilient mobile communication system that can reside completely within a network environment, capable of avoiding large-scale compromise by preventing compromised information from being useful for identifying any of the system nodes because all such information is encrypted on the nodes at all times, even during computation; and preventing communications compromise by virtue of obfuscating communication protocols.

====Defunct or dormant====
* Bitblinder - a decentralised P2P anonymity software program which included Tor but with increased speed. Website is down and clients are no longer functional.
* Invisible IRC Project - anonymous IRC, inspired by Freenet, which later became I2P (Invisible Internet Project).
* Mnet (formerly MojoNation) - a distributed file system

===Anonymous P2P in a wireless mesh network===
It is possible to implement anonymous P2P on a wireless mesh network; unlike fixed Internet connections, users don&#x27;t need to sign up with an ISP to participate in such a network, and are only identifiable through their hardware.

Protocols for wireless mesh networks are Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) and the follow-up protocol B.A.T.M.A.N., which is designed for decentralized auto-IP assignment. See also Netsukuku.

Even if a government were to outlaw the use of wireless P2P software, it would be difficult to enforce such a ban without a considerable infringement of personal freedoms. Alternatively, the government could outlaw the purchase of the wireless hardware itself.

<text>A scintillator ( ) is a material that exhibits scintillation, the property of luminescence, when excited by ionizing radiation. Luminescent materials, when struck by an incoming particle, absorb its energy and scintillate (i.e. re-emit the absorbed energy in the form of light). Sometimes, the excited state is metastable, so the relaxation back down from the excited state to lower states is delayed (necessitating anywhere from a few nanoseconds to hours depending on the material). The process then corresponds to one of two phenomena: delayed fluorescence or phosphorescence. The correspondence depends on the type of transition and hence the wavelength of the emitted optical photon.

==Principle of operation==
A scintillation detector or scintillation counter is obtained when a scintillator is coupled to an electronic light sensor such as a photomultiplier tube (PMT), photodiode, or silicon photomultiplier. PMTs absorb the light emitted by the scintillator and re-emit it in the form of electrons via the photoelectric effect. The subsequent multiplication of those electrons (sometimes called photo-electrons) results in an electrical pulse which can then be analyzed and yield meaningful information about the particle that originally struck the scintillator. Vacuum photodiodes are similar but do not amplify the signal while silicon photodiodes, on the other hand, detect incoming photons by the excitation of charge carriers directly in the silicon. Silicon photomultipliers consist of an array of photodiodes which are reverse-biased with sufficient voltage to operate in avalanche mode, enabling each pixel of the array to be sensitive to single photons.

==History==
The first device which used a scintillator was built in 1903 by Sir William Crookes and used a ZnS screen. The scintillations produced by the screen were visible to the naked eye if viewed by a microscope in a darkened room; the device was known as a spinthariscope. The technique led to a number of important discoveries but was obviously tedious. Scintillators gained additional attention in 1944, when Curran and Baker replaced the naked eye measurement with the newly developed PMT. This was the birth of the modern scintillation detector.

==Applications for scintillators==

Scintillators are used by the American government as Homeland Security radiation detectors. Scintillators can also be used in particle detectors, new energy resource exploration, X-ray security, nuclear cameras, computed tomography and gas exploration. Other applications of scintillators include CT scanners and gamma cameras in medical diagnostics, and screens in older style CRT computer monitors and television sets. Scintillators have also been proposed as part of theoretical models for the harnessing of gamma-ray energy through the photovoltaic effect, for example in a nuclear battery.

The use of a scintillator in conjunction with a photomultiplier tube finds wide use in hand-held survey meters used for detecting and measuring radioactive contamination and monitoring nuclear material. Scintillators generate light in fluorescent tubes, to convert the ultra-violet of the discharge into visible light. Scintillation detectors are also used in the petroleum industry as detectors for Gamma Ray logs.

==Properties of scintillators==

There are many desired properties of scintillators, such as high density, fast operation speed, low cost, radiation hardness, production capability, and durability of operational parameters.
High density reduces the material size of showers for high-energy γ-quanta and electrons. The range of Compton scattered photons for lower energy γ-rays is also decreased via high density materials. This results in high segmentation of the detector and leads to better spatial resolution. Usually high density materials have heavy ions in the lattice (e.g., lead, cadmium), significantly increasing the contribution of photoelectric effect (~Z4). The increased photo-fraction is important for some applications such as positron emission tomography. High stopping power for electromagnetic component of the ionizing radiation needs greater photo-fraction; this allows for a compact detector.
High operating speed is needed for good resolution of spectra. Precision of time measurement with a scintillation detector is proportional to . Short decay times are important for the measurement of time intervals and for the operation in fast coincidence circuits. High density and fast response time can allow detection of rare events in particle physics.
Particle energy deposited in the material of a scintillator is proportional to the scintillator&#x27;s response. Charged particles, γ-quanta and ions have different slopes when their response is measured. Thus, scintillators could be used to identify various types of γ-quanta and particles in fluxes of mixed radiation.
Another consideration of scintillators is the cost of producing them. Most crystal scintillators require high-purity chemicals and sometimes rare-earth metals that are fairly expensive. Not only are the materials an expenditure, but many crystals require expensive furnaces and almost six months of growth and analyzing time. Currently, other scintillators are being researched for reduced production cost.

Several other properties are also desirable in a good detector scintillator: a low gamma output (i.e., a high efficiency for converting the energy of incident radiation into scintillation photons), transparency to its own scintillation light (for good light collection), efficient detection of the radiation being studied, a high stopping power, good linearity over a wide range of energy, a short rise time for fast timing applications (e.g., coincidence measurements), a short decay time to reduce detector dead-time and accommodate high event rates, emission in a spectral range matching the spectral sensitivity of existing PMTs (although wavelength shifters can sometimes be used), an index of refraction near that of glass (≈1.5) to allow optimum coupling to the PMT window. Ruggedness and good behavior under high temperature may be desirable where resistance to vibration and high temperature is necessary (e.g., oil exploration). The practical choice of a scintillator material is usually a compromise among those properties to best fit a given application.

Among the properties listed above, the light output is the most important, as it affects both the efficiency and the resolution of the detector (the efficiency is the ratio of detected particles to the total number of particles impinging upon the detector; the energy resolution is the ratio of the full width at half maximum of a given energy peak to the peak position, usually expressed in %). The light output is a strong function of the type of incident particle or photon and of its energy, which therefore strongly influences the type of scintillation material to be used for a particular application. The presence of quenching effects results in reduced light output (i.e., reduced scintillation efficiency). Quenching refers to all radiationless deexcitation processes in which the excitation is degraded mainly to heat. The overall signal production efficiency of the detector, however, also depends on the quantum efficiency of the PMT (typically ~30% at peak), and on the efficiency of light transmission and collection (which depends on the type of reflector material covering the scintillator and light guides, the length/shape of the light guides, any light absorption, etc.). The light output is often quantified as a number of scintillation photons produced per keV of deposited energy. Typical numbers are (when the incident particle is an electron): ≈40 photons/keV for , ~10 photons/keV for plastic scintillators, and ~8 photons/keV for bismuth germanate ().

Scintillation detectors are generally assumed to be linear. This assumption is based on two requirements: (1) that the light output of the scintillator is proportional to the energy of the incident radiation; (2) that the electrical pulse produced by the photomultiplier tube is proportional to the emitted scintillation light. The linearity assumption is usually a good rough approximation, although deviations can occur (especially pronounced for particles heavier than the proton at low energies).

Resistance and good behavior under high-temperature, high-vibration environments is especially important for applications such as oil exploration (wireline logging, measurement while drilling). For most scintillators, light output and scintillation decay time depends on the temperature. This dependence can largely be ignored for room-temperature applications since it is usually weak. The dependence on the temperature is also weaker for organic scintillators than it is for inorganic crystals, such as NaI-Tl or BGO. Strong dependence of decay time on the temperature in BGO scintillator is used for remote monitoring of temperature in vacuum environment. The coupled PMTs also exhibit temperature sensitivity, and can be damaged if submitted to mechanical shock. Hence, high temperature rugged PMTs should be used for high-temperature, high-vibration applications.

The time evolution of the number of emitted scintillation photons &quot;N&quot; in a single scintillation event can often be described by linear superposition of one or two exponential decays. For two decays, we have the form:

formula_1

where &quot;τf&quot; and &quot;τs&quot; are the fast (or prompt) and the slow (or delayed) decay constants.
Many scintillators are characterized by 2 time components: one fast (or prompt), the other slow (or delayed). While the fast component usually dominates, the relative amplitude &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; of the two components depend on the scintillating material. Both of these components can also be a function of the energy loss &quot;dE&quot;/&quot;dx&quot;. In cases where this energy loss dependence is strong, the overall decay time constant varies with the type of incident particle. Such scintillators enable pulse shape discrimination, i.e., particle identification based on the decay characteristics of the PMT electric pulse. For instance, when BaF2 is used, γ rays typically excite the fast component, while α particles excite the slow component: it is thus possible to identify them based on the decay time of the PMT signal.

==Types of scintillators==

===Organic crystals===
Organic scintillators are aromatic hydrocarbon compounds which contain benzene ring structures interlinked in various ways. Their luminescence typically decays within a few nanoseconds.

Some organic scintillators are pure crystals. The most common types are anthracene (, decay time ≈30 ns), stilbene (, 4.5 ns decay time), and naphthalene (, few ns decay time). They are very durable, but their response is anisotropic (which spoils energy resolution when the source is not collimated), and they cannot be easily machined, nor can they be grown in large sizes; hence they are not very often used. Anthracene has the highest light output of all organic scintillators and is therefore chosen as a reference: the light outputs of other scintillators are sometimes expressed as a percentage of anthracene light output.

===Organic liquids===
These are liquid solutions of one or more organic scintillators in an organic solvent. The typical solutes are fluors such as &quot;p&quot;-terphenyl (), PBD (), butyl PBD (), PPO (), and wavelength shifter such as POPOP (). The most widely used solvents are toluene, xylene, benzene, phenylcyclohexane, triethylbenzene, and decalin. Liquid scintillators are easily loaded with other additives such as wavelength shifters to match the spectral sensitivity range of a particular PMT, or 10B to increase the neutron detection efficiency of the scintillation counter itself (since 10B has a high interaction cross section with thermal neutrons). Newer approaches combine several solvents or load different metals to achieve identification of incident particles. For many liquids, dissolved oxygen can act as a quenching agent and lead to reduced light output, hence the necessity to seal the solution in an oxygen-free, airtight enclosure.

===Plastic scintillators===

The term &quot;plastic scintillator&quot; typically refers to a scintillating material in which the primary fluorescent emitter, called a fluor, is suspended in the base, a solid polymer matrix. While this combination is typically accomplished through the dissolution of the fluor prior to bulk polymerization, the fluor is sometimes associated with the polymer directly, either covalently or through coordination, as is the case with many Li6 plastic scintillators. Polyethylene naphthalate has been found to exhibit scintillation by itself without any additives and is expected to replace existing plastic scintillators due to higher performance and lower price. The advantages of plastic scintillators include fairly high light output and a relatively quick signal, with a decay time of 2–4 nanoseconds, but perhaps the biggest advantage of plastic scintillators is their ability to be shaped, through the use of molds or other means, into almost any desired form with what is often a high degree of durability. Plastic scintillators are known to show light output saturation when the energy density is large (Birks&#x27; Law).

====Bases====
The most common bases used in plastic scintillators are the aromatic plastics, polymers with aromatic rings as pendant groups along the polymer backbone, amongst which polyvinyltoluene (PVT) and polystyrene (PS) are the most prominent. While the base does fluoresce in the presence of ionizing radiation, its low yield and negligible transparency to its own emission make the use of fluors necessary in the construction of a practical scintillator. Aside from the aromatic plastics, the most common base is polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), which carries two advantages over many other bases: high ultraviolet and visible light transparency and mechanical properties and higher durability with respect to brittleness. The lack of fluorescence associated with PMMA is often compensated through the addition of an aromatic co-solvent, usually naphthalene. A plastic scintillator based on PMMA in this way boasts transparency to its own radiation, helping to ensure uniform collection of light.

Other common bases include polyvinyl xylene (PVX) polymethyl, 2,4-dimethyl, 2,4,5-trimethyl styrenes, polyvinyl diphenyl, polyvinyl naphthalene, polyvinyl tetrahydronaphthalene, and copolymers of these and other bases.

====Fluors====
Also known as luminophors, these compounds absorb the scintillation of the base and then emit at larger wavelength, effectively converting the ultraviolet radiation of the base into the more easily transferred visible light. Further increasing the attenuation length can be accomplished through the addition of a second fluor, referred to as a spectrum shifter or converter, often resulting in the emission of blue or green light.

Common fluors include polyphenyl hydrocarbons, oxazole and oxadiazole aryls, especially, n-terphenyl (PPP), 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO), 1,4-di-(5-phenyl-2-oxazolyl)-benzene (POPOP), 2-phenyl-5-(4-biphenylyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD), and 2-(4’-tert-butylphenyl)-5-(4’’-biphenylyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (B-PBD).

===Inorganic crystals===

Inorganic scintillators are usually crystals grown in high temperature furnaces, for example, alkali metal halides, often with a small amount of activator impurity. The most widely used is (thallium-doped sodium iodide); its scintillation light is blue. Other inorganic alkali halide crystals are: , , (pure), , , . Some non-alkali crystals include: BGO, , , , , ,  (), , , . (For more examples, see also phosphors).

Newly developed products include , lanthanum chloride doped with cerium, as well as a cerium-doped lanthanum bromide, . They are both very hygroscopic (i.e., damaged when exposed to moisture in the air) but offer excellent light output and energy resolution (63 photons/keV γ for versus 38 photons/keV γ for ), a fast response (16 ns for versus 230 ns for ), excellent linearity, and a very stable light output over a wide range of temperatures. In addition LaBr3(Ce) offers a higher stopping power for γ rays (density of 5.08 g/cm3 versus 3.67 g/cm3 for ). LYSO () has an even higher density (7.1 g/cm3, comparable to ), is non-hygroscopic, and has a higher light output than (32 photons/keV γ), in addition to being rather fast (41 ns decay time versus 300 ns for ).

A disadvantage of some inorganic crystals, e.g., NaI, is their hygroscopicity, a property which requires them to be housed in an airtight container to protect them from moisture. and BaF2 are only slightly hygroscopic and do not usually need protection. CsF, , , are hygroscopic, while , , , and are not.

Inorganic crystals can be cut to small sizes and arranged in an array configuration so as to provide position sensitivity. Such arrays are often used in medical physics or security applications to detect X-rays or γ rays: high-&quot;Z&quot;, high density materials (e.g. LYSO, BGO) are typically preferred for this type of applications.

Scintillation in inorganic crystals is typically slower than in organic ones, ranging typically from 1.48 ns for to 9000 ns for . Exceptions are (~5 ns), fast (0.7 ns; the slow component is at 630 ns), as well as the newer products (, 28 ns; , 16 ns; , 41 ns).

For the imaging application, one of the advantage of inorganic crystals is very high light yield. Some high light yield scintillators above 100,000 photons/MeV at 662 keV are very recently reported for , , and .

Many semiconductor scintillator phosphors are known, such as ZnS(Ag) (mentioned in the history section), CdS(Ag), ZnO(Zn), ZnO(Ga), CdS(In), ZnSe(O), and ZnTe(O), but none of these are available as single crystals. CdS(Te) and ZnSe(Te) have been commercially available in single crystal form, but their luminosity is partially quenched at room temperature.

GaAs(Si,B) is a recently discovered cryogenic semiconductor scintillator with high light output in the infra-red and apparently no afterglow. In combination with ultra-low noise cryogenic photodetectors it is the target in experiments to detect rare, low-energy electronic excitations from interacting dark matter.

===Gaseous scintillators===
Gaseous scintillators consist of nitrogen and the noble gases helium, argon, krypton, and xenon, with helium and xenon receiving the most attention. The scintillation process is due to the de-excitation of single atoms excited by the passage of an incoming particle. This de-excitation is very rapid (~1 ns), so the detector response is quite fast. Coating the walls of the container with a wavelength shifter is generally necessary as those gases typically emit in the ultraviolet and PMTs respond better to the visible blue-green region. In nuclear physics, gaseous detectors have been used to detect fission fragments or heavy charged particles.

===Glasses===
The most common glass scintillators are cerium-activated lithium or boron silicates. Since both lithium and boron have large neutron cross-sections, glass detectors are particularly well suited to the detection of thermal (slow) neutrons. Lithium is more widely used than boron since it has a greater energy release on capturing a neutron and therefore greater light output. Glass scintillators are however sensitive to electrons and γ rays as well (pulse height discrimination can be used for particle identification). Being very robust, they are also well-suited to harsh environmental conditions. Their response time is ≈10 ns, their light output is however low, typically ≈30% of that of anthracene.

===Solution-based perovskite scintillators===
Scintillation properties of organic-inorganic methylamonium (MA) lead halide perovskites under proton irradiation were first reported by Shibuya et al. in 2002 and the first γ-ray pulse height spectrum, although still with poor energy resolution, was reported on () by van Eijk et al. in 2008 . Birowosuto at al. studied the scintillation properties of 3-D and 2-D layered perovskites under X-ray excitation. MAPbBr3 () emits at 550 nm and MAPbI3 () at 750 nm which is attributed to exciton emission near the band gap of the compounds. In this first generation of Pb-halide perovskites the emission is strongly quenched at room temperature and less than 1 000 ph/MeV survive. At 10 K however intense emission is observed and write about yields up to 200 000 ph/MeV. The quenching is attributed to the small e-h binding energy in the exciton that decreases for Cl to Br to I . Interestingly one may replace the organic MA group with Cs+ to obtain full inorganic CsPbX3 halide perovskites. Depending on the Cl, Br, I content the triplet X-ray excited exciton emission can be tuned from 430 nm to 700 nm . One may also dilute Cs with Rb to obtain similar tuning. Above very recent developments demonstrate that the organic-inorganic and all inorganic Pb-halide perovskites have various interesting scintillation properties. However, the recent two-dimensional perovskite single crystals with light yields between 10 000 and 40 000 ph/MeV and decay times below 10 ns at room temperature will be more favorable as they may have much larger Stokes shift up to 200 nm in comparison with CsPbBr3 quantum dot scintillators and this is essential to prevent self reabsorption for scintillators.

More recently, a new material class first reported by Professor Biwu Ma&#x27;s research group, called 0D organic metal halide hybrid (OMHH), an extension of the perovskite materials. This class of materials exhibits strong exciton binding of hundreds of meV, resulting in their high photoluminescent quantum efficiency of almost unity. Their large stoke shift and reabsorption-free properties make them desirable. Their potential applications for scintillators have been reported by the same group, and others. In 2020,(C38H34P2)MnBr4 was reported to have a light yield up to 80 000 Photon/MeV despite its low Z compared to traditional all inorganic. Impressive light yields from other 0D OMHH have been reported. There is a great potential to realize new generation scintillators from this material class. However, they are limited by their relatively long response time in microseconds, which is an area of intense research.

==Physics of scintillation==

===Organic scintillators===
Transitions made by the free valence electrons of the molecules are responsible for the production of scintillation light in organic crystals. These electrons are associated with the whole molecule rather than any particular atom and occupy the so-called -molecular orbitals. The ground state S0 is a singlet state above which are the excited singlet states (S*, the lowest triplet state (T0), and its excited levels (T*, A fine structure corresponding to molecular vibrational modes is associated with each of those electron levels. The energy spacing between electron levels is ≈1 eV; the spacing between the vibrational levels is about 1/10 of that for electron levels.

An incoming particle can excite either an electron level or a vibrational level. The singlet excitations immediately decay (&lt; 10 ps) to the S* state without the emission of radiation (internal degradation). The S* state then decays to the ground state S0 (typically to one of the vibrational levels above S0) by emitting a scintillation photon. This is the prompt component or fluorescence. The transparency of the scintillator to the emitted photon is due to the fact that the energy of the photon is less than that required for an S0 → S* transition (the transition is usually being to a vibrational level above S0).

When one of the triplet states gets excited, it immediately decays to the T0 state with no emission of radiation (internal degradation). Since the T0 → S0 transition is very improbable, the T0 state instead decays by interacting with another T0 molecule:

formula_2

and leaves one of the molecules in the S* state, which then decays to S0 with the release of a scintillation photon. Since the T0-T0 interaction takes time, the scintillation light is delayed: this is the slow or delayed component (corresponding to delayed fluorescence). Sometimes, a direct T0 → S0 transition occurs (also delayed), and corresponds to the phenomenon of phosphorescence. Note that the observational difference between delayed-fluorescence and phosphorescence is the difference in the wavelengths of the emitted optical photon in an S* → S0 transition versus a T0 → S0 transition.

Organic scintillators can be dissolved in an organic solvent to form either a liquid or plastic scintillator. The scintillation process is the same as described for organic crystals (above); what differs is the mechanism of energy absorption: energy is first absorbed by the solvent, then passed onto the scintillation solute (the details of the transfer are not clearly understood).

===Inorganic scintillators===
The scintillation process in inorganic materials is due to the electronic band structure found in crystals and is not molecular in nature as is the case with organic scintillators. An incoming particle can excite an electron from the valence band to either the conduction band or the exciton band (located just below the conduction band and separated from the valence band by an energy gap; see picture). This leaves an associated hole behind, in the valence band. Impurities create electronic levels in the forbidden gap. The excitons are loosely bound electron-hole pairs which wander through the crystal lattice until they are captured as a whole by impurity centers. The latter then rapidly de-excite by emitting scintillation light (fast component). The activator impurities are typically chosen so that the emitted light is in the visible range or near-UV where photomultipliers are effective. The holes associated with electrons in the conduction band are independent from the latter. Those holes and electrons are captured successively by impurity centers exciting certain metastable states not accessible to the excitons. The delayed de-excitation of those metastable impurity states again results in scintillation light (slow component).

BGO (bismuth germanium oxide) is a pure inorganic scintillator without any activator impurity. There, the scintillation process is due to an optical transition of the  ion, a major constituent of the crystal. In tungstate scintillators  and  the emission is due to radiative decay of self-trapped excitons.

The scintillation process in GaAs doped with silicon and boron impurities is different from conventional scintillators in that the silicon &quot;n&quot;-type doping provides a built-in population of delocalized electrons at the bottom of the conduction band. Some of the boron impurity atoms reside on arsenic sites and serve as acceptors. A scintillation photon is produced whenever an acceptor atom such as boron captures an ionization hole from the valence band and that hole recombines radiatively with one of the delocalized electrons. Unlike many other semiconductors, the delocalized electrons provided by the silicon are not “frozen out” at cryogenic temperatures. Above the Mott transition concentration of free carriers per cm3, the “metallic” state is maintained at cryogenic temperatures because mutual repulsion drives any additional electrons into the next higher available energy level, which is in the conduction band. The spectrum of photons from this process is centered at 930 nm (1.33 eV) and there are three other emission bands centered at 860, 1070, and 1335 nm from other minor processes. Each of these emission bands has a different luminosity and decay time. The high scintillation luminosity is surprising because (1) with a refractive index of about 3.5, escape is inhibited by total internal reflection and (2) experiments at 90K report narrow-beam infrared absorption coefficients of several per cm. Recent Monte Carlo and Feynman path integral calculations have shown that the high luminosity could be explained if most of the narrow beam absorption is actually a novel optical scattering from the conduction electrons with a cross section of about 5 x 10−18 cm2 that allows scintillation photons to escape total internal reflection. This cross section is about 107 times larger than Thomson scattering but comparable to the optical cross section of the conduction electrons in a metal mirror.

===Gases===
In gases, the scintillation process is due to the de-excitation of single atoms excited by the passage of an incoming particle (a very rapid process: ≈1 ns).

==Response to various radiations==

===Heavy ions===
Scintillation counters are usually not ideal for the detection of heavy ions for three reasons:
# the very high ionizing power of heavy ions induces quenching effects which result in a reduced light output (e.g. for equal energies, a proton will produce 1/4 to 1/2 the light of an electron, while alphas will produce only about 1/10 the light);
# the high stopping power of the particles also results in a reduction of the fast component relative to the slow component, increasing detector dead-time;
# strong non-linearities are observed in the detector response especially at lower energies.

The reduction in light output is stronger for organics than for inorganic crystals. Therefore, where needed, inorganic crystals, e.g. , (typically used in thin sheets as α-particle monitors), , should be preferred to organic materials. Typical applications are α-survey instruments, dosimetry instruments, and heavy ion &quot;dE&quot;/&quot;dx&quot; detectors. Gaseous scintillators have also been used in nuclear physics experiments.

===Electrons===
The detection efficiency for electrons is essentially 100% for most scintillators. But because electrons can make large angle scatterings (sometimes backscatterings), they can exit the detector without depositing their full energy in it. The back-scattering is a rapidly increasing function of the atomic number &quot;Z&quot; of the scintillator material. Organic scintillators, having a lower &quot;Z&quot; than inorganic crystals, are therefore best suited for the detection of low-energy (&lt; 10 MeV) beta particles. The situation is different for high energy electrons: since they mostly lose their energy by bremsstrahlung at the higher energies, a higher-&quot;Z&quot; material is better suited for the detection of the bremsstrahlung photon and the production of the electromagnetic shower which it can induce.

===Gamma rays===

High-&quot;Z&quot; materials, e.g. inorganic crystals, are best suited for the detection of gamma rays. The three basic ways that a gamma ray interacts with matter are: the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and pair production. The photon is completely absorbed in photoelectric effect and pair production, while only partial energy is deposited in any given Compton scattering. The cross section for the photoelectric process is proportional to &quot;Z&quot;5, that for pair production proportional to &quot;Z&quot;2, whereas Compton scattering goes roughly as &quot;Z&quot;. A high-&quot;Z&quot; material therefore favors the former two processes, enabling the detection of the full energy of the gamma ray. If the gamma rays are at higher energies (&gt;5 MeV), pair production dominates.

===Neutrons===
Since the neutron is not charged it does not interact via the Coulomb force and therefore does not ionize the scintillation material. It must first transfer some or all of its energy via the strong force to a charged atomic nucleus. The positively charged nucleus then produces ionization. Fast neutrons (generally &gt;0.5 MeV ) primarily rely on the recoil proton in (n,p) reactions; materials rich in hydrogen, e.g. plastic scintillators, are therefore best suited for their detection. Slow neutrons rely on nuclear reactions such as the (n,γ) or (n,α) reactions, to produce ionization. Their mean free path is therefore quite large unless the scintillator material contains nuclides having a high cross section for these nuclear reactions such as 6Li or 10B. Materials such as LiI(Eu) or glass silicates are therefore particularly well-suited for the detection of slow (thermal) neutrons.

==List of inorganic scintillators==
The following is a list of commonly used inorganic crystals:
* or barium fluoride: contains a very fast and a slow component. The fast scintillation light is emitted in the UV band (220 nm) and has a 0.7 ns decay time (smallest decay time for any scintillator), while the slow scintillation light is emitted at longer wavelengths (310 nm) and has a 630 ns decay time. It is used for fast timing applications, as well as applications for which pulse shape discrimination is needed. The light yield of is about 12 photons/keV. is not hygroscopic.
* or bismuth germanate: bismuth germanate has a higher stopping power, but a lower optical yield than . It is often used in coincidence detectors for detecting back-to-back gamma rays emitted upon positron annihilation in positron emission tomography machines.
* or cadmium tungstate: a high density, high atomic number scintillator with a very long decay time (14 μs), and relatively high light output (about 1/3 of that of ). is routinely used for X-ray detection (CT scanners). Having very little 228Th and 226Ra contamination, it is also suitable for low activity counting applications.
* or calcium fluoride doped with europium: The material is not hygroscopic, has a 940 ns decay time, and is relatively low-&quot;Z&quot;. The latter property makes it ideal for detection of low energy β particles because of low backscattering, but not very suitable for γ detection. Thin layers of have also been used with a thicker slab of to make phoswiches capable of discriminating between α, β, and γ particles.
* or calcium tungstate: exhibits long decay time 9 μs and short wavelength emission with maximum at 420 nm matching sensitivity curve of bialkali PMT. The light yield and energy resolution of the scintillator (6.6% for 137Cs) is comparable with that of .
* : undoped cesium iodide emits predominantly at 315 nm, is only slightly hygroscopic, and has a very short decay time (16 ns), making it suitable for fast timing applications. The light output is quite low at room temperature, however, it significantly increases with cooling.
* or cesium iodide doped with sodium: the crystal is less bright than , but comparable in light output to . The wavelength of maximum emission is at 420 nm, well matched to the photocathode sensitivity of bialkali PMTs. It has a slightly shorter decay time than (630 ns versus 1000 ns for ). is hygroscopic and needs an airtight enclosure for protection against moisture.
* or cesium iodide doped with thallium: these crystals are one of the brightest scintillators. Its maximum wavelength of light emission is in the green region at 550 nm. is only slightly hygroscopic and does not usually require an airtight enclosure.
* GaAs or gallium arsenide (suitably doped with silicon and boron impurities) is a cryogenic &quot;n&quot;-type semiconductor scintillator with a low cryogenic bandgap (1.52 eV) and high light output (100 photons/keV) in the infra-red (930 nm). The absence of thermally stimulated luminescence is evidence for the absence of afterglow, which makes it attractive for detecting rare, low energy electronic excitations from interacting dark matter. Large (5 kg) high-quality crystals are commercially grown for electronic applications.
* or gadolinium oxysulfide has a high stopping power due to its relatively high density (7.32 g/cm3) and the high atomic number of gadolinium. The light output is also good, making it useful as a scintillator for x-ray imaging applications.
* (or lanthanum bromide doped with cerium): a better (novel) alternative to ; denser, more efficient, much faster (having a decay time about ~20ns), offers superior energy resolution due to its very high light output. Moreover, the light output is very stable and quite high over a very wide range of temperatures, making it particularly attractive for high temperature applications. Depending on the application, the intrinsic activity of 138La can be a disadvantage. is very hygroscopic.
* (or lanthanum chloride doped with cerium): very fast, high light output. is a cheaper alternative to . It is also quite hygroscopic.
* or lead tungstate: due to its high-&quot;Z&quot;, is suitable for applications where a high stopping power is required (e.g. γ ray detection).
* or lutetium iodide.
* or lutetium oxyorthosilicate (): used in positron emission tomography because it exhibits properties similar to bismuth germanate (), but with a higher light yield. Its only disadvantage is the intrinsic background from the beta decay of natural 176Lu.
* (): comparable in density to , but much faster and with much higher light output; excellent for medical imaging applications. is non-hygroscopic.
* or sodium iodide doped with thallium: is by far the most widely used scintillator material. It is available in single crystal form or the more rugged polycrystalline form (used in high vibration environments, e.g. wireline logging in the oil industry). Other applications include nuclear medicine, basic research, environmental monitoring, and aerial surveys. is very hygroscopic and needs to be housed in an airtight enclosure.
* or yttrium aluminum garnet: is non-hygroscopic. The wavelength of maximum emission is at 550 nm, well-matched to red-resistive PMTs or photo-diodes. It is relatively fast (70 ns decay time). Its light output is about 1/3 of that of . The material exhibits some properties that make it particularly attractive for electron microscopy applications (e.g. high electron conversion efficiency, good resolution, mechanical ruggedness and long lifetime).
* or zinc sulfide: is one of the older inorganic scintillators (the first experiment making use of a scintillator by Sir William Crookes (1903) involved a ZnS screen). It is only available as a polycrystalline powder, however. Its use is therefore limited to thin screens used primarily for α particle detection.
* or zinc tungstate is similar to scintillator exhibiting long decay constant 25 μs and slightly lower light yield.

<doc id="454325" wikidata="Q65122103" url="?curid=454325" title="Locally compact abelian group">
<text>In several mathematical areas, including harmonic analysis, topology, and number theory, locally compact abelian groups are abelian groups which have a particularly convenient topology on them. For example, the group of integers (equipped with the discrete topology), or the real numbers or the circle (both with their usual topology) are locally compact abelian groups.

==Definition and examples==

A topological group is called &quot;locally compact&quot; if the underlying topological space is locally compact and Hausdorff; the topological group is called &quot;abelian&quot; if the underlying group is abelian.

Examples of locally compact abelian groups include:

* formula_1 for &quot;n&quot; a positive integer, with vector addition as group operation.
* The positive real numbers formula_2 with multiplication as operation. This group is isomorphic to formula_3 by the exponential map.
* Any finite abelian group, with the discrete topology. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, all such groups are products of cyclic groups.
* The integers formula_4 under addition, again with the discrete topology.
* The circle group, denoted formula_5 for torus. This is the group of complex numbers of modulus 1. formula_5 is isomorphic as a topological group to the quotient group formula_7.
* The field formula_8 of &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers under addition, with the usual &quot;p&quot;-adic topology.

==The dual group==

If formula_9 is a locally compact &quot;abelian&quot; group, a character of formula_9 is a continuous group homomorphism from formula_9 with values in the circle group formula_5. The set of all characters on formula_9 can be made into a locally compact abelian group, called the &quot;dual group&quot; of formula_9 and denoted formula_15. The group operation on the dual group is given by pointwise multiplication of characters, the inverse of a character is its complex conjugate and the topology on the space of characters is that of uniform convergence on compact sets (i.e., the compact-open topology, viewing formula_16 as a subset of the space of all continuous functions from formula_9 to formula_5.). This topology is in general not metrizable. However, if the group formula_9 is a separable locally compact abelian group, then the dual group is metrizable.

This is analogous to the dual space in linear algebra: just as for a vector space formula_20 over a field formula_21, the dual space is formula_22, so too is the dual group formula_23. More abstractly, these are both examples of representable functors, being represented respectively by formula_21 and formula_5.

A group that is isomorphic (as topological groups) to its dual group is called &quot;self-dual&quot;. While the reals and finite cyclic groups are self-dual, the group and the dual group are not &quot;naturally&quot; isomorphic, and should be thought of as two different groups.

===Examples of dual groups===

The dual of formula_4 is isomorphic to the circle group formula_5. A character on the infinite cyclic group of integers formula_4 under addition is determined by its value at the generator 1. Thus for any character formula_29 on formula_4, formula_31. Moreover, this formula defines a character for any choice of formula_32 in formula_5. The topology of uniform convergence on compact sets is in this case the topology of pointwise convergence. This is the topology of the circle group inherited from the complex numbers.

The dual of formula_5 is canonically isomorphic with formula_4. Indeed, a character on formula_5 is of the form formula_37 for formula_38 an integer. Since formula_5 is compact, the topology on the dual group is that of uniform convergence, which turns out to be the discrete topology.

The group of real numbers formula_40, is isomorphic to its own dual; the characters on formula_40 are of the form formula_42 for formula_43 a real number. With these dualities, the version of the Fourier transform to be introduced next coincides with the classical Fourier transform on formula_40.

Analogously, the group of formula_45-adic numbers formula_8 is isomorphic to its dual. (In fact, any finite extension of formula_8 is also self-dual.) It follows that the adeles are self-dual.

==Pontryagin duality==

Pontryagin duality asserts that the functor
:formula_48
induces an equivalence of categories between the opposite of the category of locally compact abelian groups (with continuous morphisms) and itself:
:formula_49

==Categorical properties==
 shows that the category LCA of locally compact abelian groups measures, very roughly speaking, the difference between the integers and the reals. More precisely, the algebraic K-theory spectrum of the category of locally compact abelian groups and the ones of Z and R lie in a homotopy fiber sequence
:formula_50

<text>José Manuel Joly Braga Santos, (; May 14, 1924July 18, 1988) was a Portuguese composer and conductor, who was born and died in Lisbon. He wrote six symphonies.

==Biography==
José Manuel Joly Braga Santos was born in Lisbon in 1924 and died in this city in 1988, at the peak of his musical creativity. Having studied violin and composition at the National Conservatoire of Lisbon, he became a disciple of Luís de Freitas Branco (1890–1955), the leading Portuguese composer of the preceding generation.

After the Second World War, he was able to go abroad, having studied conducting with Hermann Scherchen and Antonino Votto, and composition with Virgilio Mortari. In 1945 he visited England where he met Ralph Vaughan Williams, who encouraged him to use his native folksong in his symphonic music and also suggested that he should take lessons in counterpoint. He was undoubtedly the leading Portuguese symphonist of the 20th century, and perhaps of all time. Apart from an innate sense of orchestration, his musical language is based on a strong musical architecture as well as drama, with long melodic phrases and a natural instinct for structural development. In his own words, he wanted “to contribute toward a Latin symphonism and to react against the predominant tendency, of the generation that preceded me, to reject monumentalism in music”.

In his first works, the composer showed a modal tendency motivated by the desire to establish a connection between contemporary music and the golden age of Portuguese music: the Renaissance. We also find a melodic outline of the oldest folk songs of his country. Although he was not particularly interested in the Portuguese folklore, studying and composing at the country home of his mentor, in the rural south of Portugal - the Alentejo - he naturally accepted the influence of the very old local folklore that he considered &quot;of mesmerizing originality and grandeur&quot;.

The first four symphonies, which followed each other quite rapidly (between the ages of 22 and 27), were immediately performed by the Portuguese Radio Symphony Orchestra in Lisbon, and met with great success. The conductor and founder of the Portuguese Radio Symphony Orchestra was the great Portuguese conductor Pedro de Freitas Branco, a friend of Maurice Ravel, Manuel de Falla, and former director of the Orchestre Lamoureux. Pedro de Freitas Branco early recognised his brother’s pupil’s talent and launched Joly Braga Santos&#x27;s international career during the 1950s, conducting several international premieres of his works around Europe. Other works of this period are the Concerto for Strings, Variations on an Alentejo Theme, and three Symphonic Overtures. Most of the works were recorded, from the 1970s onwards, by the Portuguese label Strauss SP, and more recently, by the Naxos / Marco Polo label.

Following closely the works of post-war European composers, his style became, from 1960 onwards, more chromatic. The period of travel and the time he devoted to conducting provided him with what he described as a useful period of rest, decisive for the evolution of his musical style toward increased chromaticism and less traditional form. To this period belong the works Three Symphonic Sketches, Sinfonietta, the Requiem, his 5th and 6th Symphonies, and Divertimento no. 2.

Joly Braga Santos also wrote three operas, chamber music for a wide variety of instruments and ensembles, film scores, and several choral works based on poems from the great classical and modern Portuguese and Spanish poets such as Camões, Antero de Quental, Teixeira de Pascoaes, Fernando Pessoa, Garcilaso de la Vega, Antonio Machado and Rosalía de Castro.

Joly Braga Santos lectured on composition at the National Conservatoire of Lisbon, where he introduced the chair of Musical Analysis. He was also director of the Oporto Symphony Orchestra and one of the founders of the Juventude Musical Portuguesa (Portuguese Musical Youth). As a critic and journalist he produced a vast range of work for several Portuguese and foreign newspapers and journals.

He died in Lisbon of a stroke.

==Awards==
The Three Symphonic Sketches (1962) were distinguished by Donemus in 1963, and the 5th Symphony, by the «Tribune Internationale des Compositeurs» (UNESCO) in 1966.

In 2004, the recording of the Symphony No. 4 by Naxos/Marco Polo, performed by the National Symphony Orchestra of Ireland and conducted by Álvaro Cassuto received the Cannes Classical Award for the CD Premier category.

In 1977, Joly Braga Santos was distinguished with the Order of Santiago de Espada by António Ramalho Eanes, the President of the Portuguese Republic.

<doc id="454332" wikidata="Q1569521" url="?curid=454332" title="Silbervogel">
<text>Silbervogel (German for &quot;silver bird&quot;) was a design for a liquid-propellant rocket-powered sub-orbital bomber produced by Eugen Sänger and Irene Bredt in the late 1930s for The Third Reich. It is also known as the RaBo ( – &quot;rocket bomber&quot;). It was one of a number of designs considered for the &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; project, which started in the spring of 1942, being focused solely on trans-Atlantic-range piston-engined strategic bombers such as the Messerschmitt Me 264 and the Junkers Ju 390, the only two airframe types which were actually built and flown for the competition. When Walter Dornberger attempted to create interest in military spaceplanes in the United States after World War II he chose the more diplomatic term &quot;antipodal bomber&quot;.

== Concept ==
The design incorporated new rocket technology and the principle of the lifting body, foreshadowing future development of winged spacecraft such as the X-20 Dyna-Soar of the 1960s and the Space Shuttle of the 1970s. In the end, it was considered too complex and expensive to produce. The design never went beyond the mock-up stage.

The Silbervogel was intended to fly long distances in a series of short hops. The aircraft was to have begun its mission propelled along a long rail track by a large rocket-powered sled to about . Once airborne, it was to fire its own rocket engine and continue to climb to an altitude of , at which point it would be travelling at about . It would then gradually descend into the stratosphere, where the increasing air density would generate lift against the flat underside of the aircraft, eventually causing it to &quot;bounce&quot; and gain altitude again, where this pattern would be repeated. Because of aerodynamic drag, each bounce would be shallower than the preceding one, but it was still calculated that the Silbervogel would be able to cross the Atlantic, deliver a bomb to the continental United States, and then continue its flight to a landing site somewhere in the Empire of Japan–held Pacific, a total journey of .

Postwar analysis of the Silbervogel design involving a mathematical control analysis unearthed a computational error. It turned out that the heat flow during the initial atmospheric re-entry would have been much greater than the original one calculated by Sänger and Bredt. Hence, if the design had been actually constructed, it would have been destroyed by the heat, which would have exceeded design limits and melted the craft. The problem could have been solved by augmenting the heat shield, but this would have reduced the craft&#x27;s payload capacity significantly, reducing its use for the intended mission of bombing distant areas.

==History==
On 3 December 1941 Sänger sent his initial proposal for a suborbital glider to the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) as &quot;Geheime Kommandosache Nr. 4268/LXXX5&quot;. The 900-page proposal was regarded with disfavor at the RLM due to its size and complexity and was filed away. Then Sänger went to work on more modest projects such as the Skoda-Kauba Sk P.14 ramjet fighter.

Professor Walter Gregorii had Sänger rework his report, and a greatly reduced version was submitted to the RLM in September 1944, as UM 3538. It was the first serious proposal for a vehicle which could carry a pilot and payload to the lower edge of space.

Two crewed and one uncrewed version were proposed: the (antipodal long-range glider) and the (intercontinental long-range glider). Both were to be launched from a rocket-powered sled. The two crewed versions were identical, except in payload. The was to be launched at a very steep angle (which would shorten the range) and after dropping its bomb load on New York City was to land at a Japanese base in the Pacific.

== Postwar ==

After the war ended, Sänger and Bredt worked for the French government and in 1949 founded the Fédération Astronautique. Whilst in France, Sänger was the subject of a botched attempt by Soviet agents to win him over. Joseph Stalin had become intrigued by reports of the Silbervogel design and sent his son Vasily and scientist Grigori Tokaty to kidnap Sänger and Bredt and bring them to the USSR. When this plan failed, a new design bureau was set up by Mstislav Vsevolodovich Keldysh in 1946 to research the idea. A new version powered by ramjets instead of a rocket engine was developed, usually known as the Keldysh bomber, but not produced. The design formed the basis for a number of additional cruise missile designs into the early 1960s, none of which were produced.

In the US, a similar project, the X-20 Dyna-Soar, was to be launched on a Titan II booster. As the crewed space role moved to NASA, and uncrewed reconnaissance satellites were thought to be capable of all required missions, the United States Air Force gradually withdrew from crewed space flight, and Dyna-Soar was cancelled.

One lasting impact of the Silverbird project is the &quot;regenerative cooling–regenerative engine&quot; design, in which fuel or oxidizer is run in tubes around the engine bell to cool the bell and pressurize the fluid. The concept had been known for a long time, but Sänger&#x27;s team made important work towards its practical use. Almost all modern rocket engines use a similar design.

<text>is a national park located on the island of Hokkaidō, Japan. Along with Daisetsuzan National Park, these are the two oldest national parks in Hokkaidō. The park was established December 4, 1934.

Akan is an area of volcanic craters and forests, covering . The park is famous for its crystal clear lakes, its hot springs, and its large marimo. It is the only place where marimo of appreciable size form naturally in Japan.

==Sites==
The park can be divided into two general areas, Kawayu and Akan.

===Kawayu===
Mount Iō and the Kawayu Onsen offer natural hotsprings and sulphur fumaroles. Around Lake Kussharo, a caldera lake, are Bihoro Pass, Mount Mokoto, and Mount Nishibetsu. At the lake, Wakoto Peninsula is an area with high ground temperatures and uniquely adapted wildlife. Lake Mashū is a caldera lake. It is one of the clearest lakes in the world with visibility up to 40 meters.

===Akan===
Akan Caldera is a large caldera over 20 km across. Emerging from within caldera is the Akan Volcanic Complex, which includes the highest mountain in the park, Mount Meakan. The lake also features boiling mud, called &quot;bokke&quot;. Churui island is one of four islands in the lake and the site of the Marimo Exhibition and Observation Center. Lake Onnetō is at the foot of Mount Meakan. Nearby is a hot water waterfall, &quot;Onnetō Yu-no-taki&quot;. From Sokodai, one can observe Lake Penketo and Lake Panketo. Mount Hakuto Observatory, Mount Kikin, Tsurumi Pass, and Akan Lakeside Observatory offer panoramas of the surrounding countryside.

<text>Gustavo Adrián Cerati (11 August 1959 – 4 September 2014) was an Argentine musician, singer-songwriter, and record producer, who gained international recognition for being the leader, vocalist, composer, and guitarist of the rock band Soda Stereo. He is widely considered by critics, specialized press, and musicians as one of the most important and influential artists of Latin rock. Billboard magazine ranked Cerati as the 33rd best rock singer of all time.

Influenced by The Beatles and The Police, Cerati joined various groups during his adolescence, and in 1982 he founded the Latin rock band Soda Stereo. Leader and main composer of the group, from &quot;Signos&quot; (1986) his way of making songs began to mature, and his consolidation reached it at the beginning of the 90s with &quot;Canción Animal&quot; (1990), in which he returned to the roots of Argentine rock from the 70&#x27;s. Parallel to his career with the group, in 1992 he published the album &quot;Colores Santos&quot; as a duet with Daniel Melero, considered one of the first in South America to include electronic music, and the following year he would publish his first as a soloist, &quot;Amor Amarillo&quot;. His taste for electronic music led him to incorporate it into his latest works with Soda Stereo. After the separation of the band, he released &quot;Bocanada&quot; (1999) and &quot;Siempre es hoy&quot; (2002), where he showed his interest in the genre more than he freely manifested in his alternate projects Plan V and Ocio. He returned to the rock style with his fourth album, &quot;Ahí vamos&quot; (2006), which received acclaim from the public and critics, and which contains some of his greatest solo hits, such as &quot;Crimen&quot; and &quot;Adiós&quot;. In 2007, he reunited with Soda Stereo after ten years apart on a tour that brought together more than a million viewers. In 2010, he was left in a coma after suffering a stroke, after finishing a concert in which he promoted his latest album, &quot;Fuerza Natural&quot; (2009). Four years later, on 4 September 2014, Cerati died of cardiac arrest in Buenos Aires aged 55.

Cerati was a prolific session player, he was a guest guitarist on songs by Caifanes, Babasónicos and Los Brujos, and he collaborated on songs with Charly García, Andrés Calamaro, Fito Páez, Shakira, Andy Summers, Roger Waters and Mercedes Sosa, among others.

Throughout his solo career, he has sold more than 10 million records and won numerous awards, including the Latin Grammy, MTV, Konex, and Gardel. In 2012, Rolling Stone ranked Cerati in seventh place among the 100 best Argentine rock guitarists.

==Early life and Soda Stereo==
Cerati was born on 11 August 1959 in Barracas, Buenos Aires, Argentina. He grew up in a middle class household; his paternal family was of Lombard descent and his maternal family was of Irish origin. His father was an accountant and regularly traveled abroad. From his early memories he had an idyllic love of the sun and nature. Cerati&#x27;s first passion was art and in elementary school he drew comics and created his own comic book characters.

Cerati&#x27;s parents, Juan José Cerati and Lilian Clarke acquired a guitar for him when he was nine years old, at that point Cerati started to take music seriously, becoming a fanatic of rock and roll: 

By the age of 13, he formed a trio and started playing at house parties and in the local Catholic school, where he eventually joined the choir. Cerati was a good student until his third year of junior high school when he met a fellow student who, like himself, was into rock and roll. 
After serving compulsory military service in 1979, Cerati entered the university to pursue a marketing degree, something he was not passionate about. His family supported him with his music, &quot;Mi familia me vio tan enloquecido con la música, que pensaron que algo de éxito iba a tener&quot; (My family saw that I was so crazy about music, that they thought I would have some success [with it]). At the Universidad del Salvador, a Jesuit university in Buenos Aires, he met Héctor &quot;Zeta&quot; Bosio, also a marketing student. The two hit it off and decided to form a band. They were fans of The Police, The Beatles, XTC, Elvis Costello, Television, and Talking Heads. In 1982, after various lineup changes that included Richard Coleman, Daniel Melero, and Andrés Calamaro as well as others, Bosio and Cerati recruited Charly Alberti as their drummer, thus forming Soda Stereo.

Soda Stereo signed to Discos CBS (the regional branch of Sony Music in Latin America) in 1984 and released their debut LP &quot;Soda Stereo&quot; that same year. &quot;Nada Personal&quot; (&quot;Nothing Personal&quot;) followed in 1985 giving Soda Stereo their first hit with &quot;Cuando pase el temblor&quot; (&quot;When The Earthquake Is Past&quot;). Soda released &quot;Signos&quot; (&quot;Signs&quot;) in 1986, &quot;Doble Vida&quot; (&quot;Double Life&quot;) (produced by longtime David Bowie collaborator Carlos Alomar) in 1988, and &quot;Canción Animal&quot; (&quot;Animal Song&quot;) in 1990. During the 1990s Soda Stereo released &quot;Dynamo&quot; in 1992, &quot;Sueño Stereo&quot; (&quot;Stereo Dream&quot;) in 1995, and their final album &quot;Comfort y Música Para Volar&quot; (&quot;Comfort and music to fly with&quot;) in 1996

==Solo career==
===1990s===

In 1992 Cerati recorded &quot;Colores Santos&quot; (&quot;Holy Colors&quot;) with electronic musician Daniel Melero, a longtime Soda Stereo collaborator. 1993 saw the release of Cerati&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Amor Amarillo&quot; (&quot;Yellow Love&quot;), which included the participation of Zeta Bosio and Cerati&#x27;s wife at the time, the Chilean singer, actress, and model Cecilia Amenábar who sang and appeared in the video for the lead single &quot;Te llevo para que me lleves&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ll take you so you can take me&quot;).

In 1995 Gustavo Cerati teamed up with three Chilean musicians, Andrés Bucci, Guillermo Ugarte, and Christian Powditch, to form &quot;Plan V&quot;. Plan V released two albums &quot;Plan V&quot; (1996), and &quot;Plan Black V Dog&quot; (1998), a collaboration with the British electronic music group The Black Dog. In 1999 Cerati formed the electronic duo Ocio with longtime Soda Stereo collaborator and trumpeter, Flavio Etcheto, releasing &quot;Medida Universal&quot;.

Around this time Cerati participated in the album &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Americas: A Rock en Español Tribute to the Police&quot; collaborating with Andy Summers of The Police and Vinnie Colaiuta (Frank Zappa, Sting), on a cover of The Police&#x27;s &quot;Bring on the Night,&quot; (Spanish: Traeme la Noche).

&quot;Bocanada&quot; (&quot;Puff&quot;) was released in 1999 and was regarded as Gustavo Cerati&#x27;s proper debut as a solo artist. It was recorded in Estudio CasaSubmarina (Cerati&#x27;s home studio) in Buenos Aires. Cerati used an MPC to record many of the tracks. The 48-piece orchestra in &quot;Verbo Carne&quot; was recorded in Abbey Road Studios in London. The album was also mixed and mastered in London at Townhouse Studios. &quot;Bocanada&quot;&#x27; immediately reached gold status in Argentina and received many accolades in the Argentinian and Latin American press. The album was universally praised for its grandeur and its beauty and is still considered by critics and fans alike as Cerati&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;. The veteran Mexican rock critic David Cortés Arce had this to say about it, &quot;&quot;Bocanada&quot; is a fundamental album in the history of Iberoamerican Rock, in general, in all of the Spanish speaking countries.&quot;

===2000–2005===
In 2001 Cerati made his foray into film with the score for the movie &quot;+Bien&quot; (literally, &quot;+Good.&quot; A better translation of the phrase as used in Argentina would be &quot;Of course&quot;, &quot;duh!&quot;), in which he acted as well. The film was an independent movie directed by Eduardo Capilla, and starred Ruth Infarinato, VJ for Latin MTV. Cerati&#x27;s wife at the time, Cecilia Amenábar, also played a small role in the film. The soundtrack was nominated for an award in the category of the best instrumental pop album at the 3rd Annual Latin Grammy Awards.

In August 2001 Cerati held a private concert in the historic Avenida Theatre in Buenos Aires. He was accompanied by a 42-piece orchestra conducted by Alejandro Terán. The recording of the concert was released as &quot;11 Episodios Sinfónicos&quot; (&quot;Eleven Symphonic Episodes&quot;) and consisted of seven arrangements of Soda Stereo classics and four of his solo songs played entirely by the orchestra. Cerati took &quot;11 Episodios Sinfónicos&quot; on the road, playing Mexico City, Caracas, Santiago, and finishing it off with three shows at the Gran Rex theater in Buenos Aires. The CD was well received by critics and fans alike and a live DVD was eventually released.

In November 2002 Cerati released his third studio album &quot;Siempre es Hoy&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s Always Today&quot;). Cerati enlisted the help of producer/ engineer Sacha Triujeque and Antonio &quot;Toy&quot; Hernández of the Mexican Hip hop group Control Machete. The album was a departure from the slow tempo, Trip hop of &quot;Bocanada&quot; and &quot;+Bien&quot;, and the dramatic orchestration of &quot;11 Episodios Sinfónicos&quot;. The songs on the album varied from pop/rock to radio-friendly electronic rock. The tour for &quot;Siempre es Hoy&quot; extended as far as New York and Chicago.
In 2003 Cerati released &quot;Siempre es Hoy: Reversiones&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s Always Today: Re-versions&quot;) an album of remixes of &quot;Siempre es Hoy&quot; tracks from different Latin American Musicians and the German producer Wechsel Garland.

Simultaneously, Cerati teamed up with longtime collaborator Flavio Etcheto, and Leandro Fresco to form the self-described &quot;power laptop trio&quot; Roken, which he played concurrently during the &quot;Siempre es Hoy&quot; tour. Roken&#x27;s non-conventional approach focused on improvisation and writing songs in real time. They played in various festivals throughout Latin America as well as in underground clubs in the United States.

In 2004 &quot;Canciones Elegidas 93-04&quot; (&quot;Selected Songs 93-04&quot;) a double album compilation of Cerati&#x27;s solo work was released simultaneously in Spain and Argentina. The release was followed by a small tour of Mexico, Argentina, Chile and Spain.

===2005–2010===
After working for much of 2005 on new material, Cerati released &quot;Ahí Vamos&quot; (&quot;There We Go&quot;) in April 2006. Co-produced by longtime Soda Stereo collaborator Tweety González, &quot;Ahí Vamos&quot; marked Cerati&#x27;s triumphant return to guitar rock. For the recording of &quot;Ahí Vamos&quot;, Cerati was accompanied by longtime collaborators, Richard Coleman, Fernando Nalé, and many others. The album was mixed by Héctor Castillo, a prolific engineer whose credits include David Bowie, Lou Reed, and Aterciopelados, to name a few. The album was mastered by Howie Weinberg at Masterdisk in New York City. &quot;Ahí Vamos&quot; was lauded by fans and critics alike as a return to form for Cerati. The &quot;Ahí Vamos&quot; tour traveled through Latin America, the Caribbean, the United States (where he played in New York&#x27;s Central Park), Spain, and on 12 October 2006, Cerati played London, England, for the first time in his career.

The album was showered with accolades and awards, receiving eight Gardel (the equivalent of a U.S. Grammy) nominations in Argentina and winning all but one of the nominations, a first for any Argentinian artist. In the Viña del Mar International Song Festival Cerati was awarded the top prizes, &quot;&quot;Antorcha de Oro&quot;,&quot; (Gold Torch) and the &quot;Gaviota De Plata&quot; (Silver Seagull). It was the most nominated album during the 2006 Latin Grammy awards and the MTV Latino awards. Cerati won three Grammys, for Best Rock Vocal, best Rock song, and one for the best producer with his production work on Shakira&#x27;s Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 (Oral Fixation, Vol. 1). &quot;Ahí Vamos&quot; also topped the &quot;best of&quot; lists in the Argentinian press and he was even awarded a prize by the City of Buenos Aires for his contribution to Argentinian culture. Cerati closed the &quot;Ahí Vamos&quot; tour with a massive open-air show in Buenos Aires, held on the corner of Avenida Alcorta and Pampas. The free show was attended by 200,000 people.

2007 also saw the reunion of Soda Stereo. The subsequent comeback tour Me Verás Volver (&quot;You will See Me Return&quot;) consisted of 22 concerts in nine countries: Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico the United States, Colombia, Panama, Venezuela and Peru. The tour was attended by more than one million fans and broke attendance records in various cities.

In July 2007, Cerati participated in the Live Earth Festival in Hamburg Germany, alongside Shakira. Besides working with Shakira, Cerati contributed to, Argentinian producer, musician, and two-time Oscar winner, Gustavo Santaolla&#x27;s album &quot;Mar Dulce&quot; (&quot;Sweet Sea&quot;). Cerati sang on &quot;El Mareo&quot; the second single on Santaolalla&#x27;s &quot;Mar Dulce&quot; which was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York City. In 2008, Cerati released a DVD version of &quot;Ahí Vamos&quot; and performed in various festivals throughout Latin America alongside, Shakira, Fito Páez, and Gustavo Santaolalla.

In late 2008 Cerati recruited many of the same musicians who worked on &quot;Ahí Vamos&quot; to begin work on his new album. In March 2009, Cerati and his band traveled to Stratosphere Sound in New York City and Looking Glass studios to record tracks for &quot;Fuerza Natural&quot; (&quot;Natural Force&quot;). Notable contributors included Héctor Castillo, Session drummer Sterling Campbell whose resume includes David Bowie, Cyndi Lauper, and Duran Duran, Didi Gutman of Brazilian Girls, bassist and lap steel guitarists Byron Isaacs, and keyboardist Glenn Patscha.
&quot;Fuerza Natural&quot; was a marked change from the riffing of Ahí Vamos and the electronics of &quot;Bocanada&quot; and &quot;Siempre es Hoy&quot;. The collections of songs focused on a cleaner, more acoustic pop sound, as well as folk and Neo-psychedelia. Rolling Stone Argentina took notice of this, &quot;pero es más folkie, más espacial y más acústico, con una legión de guitarras, mandolinas y dobros que levantan polvo sobre las programaciones&quot; (English: but it is more folkie, more spatial and acoustic, with a legion of guitars, mandolins, and dobros that sprinkle dust on the sequencers). Similar observations were made by Mariano Prunes writing in AllMusic, &quot;Fuerza Natural has a curious sequencing structure, as it seems to be organized in stylistic batches. It begins with a trio of bona fide Cerati hits in that suave, effortless manner that always suited him so well; it then switches to a surprising but rather unsuccessful bluesy/folksy diptych.&quot;

Regardless of the mixed reviews, &quot;Fuerza Natural&quot; entered the charts in Argentina, Mexico, and Chile at No. 1. It is the first Cerati album to be sold in digital format in Argentina through MusicPass as well as was iTunes. The album sold 40,000 copies in Argentina on its first week of release and 500,000 albums worldwide. In 2010 Cerati was awarded a Latin Grammy for &quot;Best Rock Song.&quot;

The &quot;Fuerza Natural&quot; tour kicked off on 19 November in Monterrey Mexico. Cerati played Stadiums and large venues in Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Chile, The United States, Uruguay, Colombia and Venezuela, 21 shows in total. Cerati&#x27;s final show was held in Caracas, Venezuela on 15 May 2010. Cerati suffered a stroke immediately after the show.

==Personal life==
Gustavo Cerati maintained a very low public profile and not much is known about his private life. Cerati&#x27;s first wife was Belén Edwards, an Argentine designer whom he married in 1987 and divorced in 1989. In 1992 he married the Chilean model, actress, and singer Cecilia Amenábar. Their marriage lasted for ten years and they had two children Benito Cerati Amenábar, also a singer and musician, and Lisa Cerati Amenábar.

After his divorce from Cecilia Amenábar, Cerati dated the Argentine model Deborah del Corral, ex-girlfriend of Soda Stereo drummer Charly Alberti in the 1990s. She also sang in Alberti&#x27;s side project Plum.

In 2008 Cerati started dating the Argentine actress Leonora Balcarce. While they broke up in late 2009, she remained friendly with him and his family, visiting his bedside throughout his coma.

Cerati maintained from 2004 until his last days a close acquaintance with the Uruguayan artist Jill Mulleady.

Cerati met Argentine model Chloe Bello during the summer of 2009, when she was 22 years old. Despite the age difference, the two of them became involved. Cerati invited Bello to attend the launch of Fuerza Natural in Mendoza and subsequently joined him on an international tour. Due to work obligations, Bello left his side before Cerati traveled to Caracas, where he suffered a stroke that led to a coma, complications from which eventually cost him his life four years later.

==Failing health and death==
After performing two shows in Medellín and Bogotá, Colombia, Cerati headed to Venezuela and performed one last show in Caracas on 15 May 2010. Cerati suffered a stroke just after putting an end to this performance. He developed the first symptoms of an unknown condition backstage. He was hospitalized in Centro Médico La Trinidad in Caracas under medical surveillance. Three days later, Cerati underwent surgery to relieve pressure on his brain due to the stroke he suffered.

On 7 June 2010, Cerati was transferred to the FLENI Neurological Institute in Buenos Aires. Doctors immediately treated Cerati for a respiratory tract infection.

On 14 May 2014, the family released a statement to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the stroke. It included a medical report by Gustavo Barbalace M.D. stating: &quot;Mr. Gustavo Cerati remains hospitalized (...) without any serious complications, in good nutritional shape, and without lesions due to immobility. Neurologically there are no significant changes and remains under mechanical respiratory aid.&quot;

After four years in a coma, Gustavo Cerati died from cardiac arrest on the morning of 4 September 2014 while on life support. Immediately after his death, Cerati&#x27;s doctor stated to the media &quot;Gustavo died with dignity without any pain, without any wounds.&quot; His body was buried at La Chacarita Cemetery in Buenos Aires.

==Tributes and remembrances==

While performing at Rock in Rio Madrid on 5 June 2010, Colombian singer Shakira dedicated her song &quot;Sale el Sol&quot; to Cerati. It was her first live performance of the song which became the title track of her ninth studio album.

During their U2 360° Tour, Irish rock band U2 paid tribute to Cerati during a concert in La Plata, Argentina, in March 2011. The tribute came during the intro to &quot;Moment of Surrender&quot;. Bono said &quot;We would like you to think about Gustavo Cerati. We send him our love and respect, and he will hear our voices tonight.&quot; The 60,000 fans attending the show at the Único Stadium gave him a standing ovation.

Swedish rockers Roxette performed the intro of &quot;De Música Ligera&quot; before their song &quot;Joyride&quot; in one of their Travelling the World Tour shows in May 2012. The crowd sang the first verse of the song.

On 11 August 2015, Google celebrated his 56th birthday with a Google Doodle.

British rock band Coldplay paid tribute to Cerati by performing &quot;De Música Ligera&quot; on the final concerts of their A Head Full of Dreams Tour in La Plata, Argentina, on 14 November 2017. One year before, singer Chris Martin had revealed that his favorite latin songs were &quot;De Música Ligera&quot; and &quot;Agua de beber&quot; by Vinicius de Moraes and Tom Jobim.

In 2015, Cerati was featured in various Argentine stamps. Also, a street in Entre Rios was renamed in his honor.

In 2018, National Geographic Latin America created a two-part documentary series on Gustavo Cerati Also, several murals of Cerati were painted in Buenos Aires.

<doc id="454348" wikidata="Q1194619" url="?curid=454348" title="Lake Mashū">
<text>(Ainu: Kamuy-to) is an endorheic crater lake formed in the caldera of a potentially active volcano. It is located in Akan Mashu National Park on the island of Hokkaido, Japan. It has been called the clearest lake in the world.

==Hydrology==

Lake Mashū is surrounded by steep crater walls high. It has no significant inlets and no outlet. The lake is one of the clearest in the world and one of the deepest in Japan. On August 1, 1931, the transparency of the water was measured at . Around the same time Lake Baikal was measured . This is the basis for the lake&#x27;s claim to be the clearest in the world. Since the 1950s the transparency has tended to range between . The loss in transparency is probably due to the introduction of sockeye salmon and rainbow trout into the lake and landslides. At the same time, the clarity of Lake Baikal has not been measured.

In summer, the surface of Lake Mashū is often obscured by fog. There is usually fog covering around the lake for about 100 days of the year. This has given the lake a reputation for mysteriousness. A local legend says that if a person can see the surface of the lake, they will have bad luck.

==Origin of the name==
The origin of Lake Mashū&#x27;s name is unclear. The lake&#x27;s original Ainu name was Kintan-kamuy-to or &quot;lake of the mountain god&quot;. Ainu language researcher Nagata Housei proposed that the Japanese name originated from the Ainu Mas-un-to or &quot;lake of the gulls.&quot; This was then rendered as by the Japanese. Over time, however, the Japanese began to refer to the lake by the Japanese reading for the neighboring peak, . The kanji for this peak translate roughly as &quot;scrubbed area mountain&quot;. The Ainu name for this peak, by which it is commonly known today, is Kamuinupuri or &quot;mountain of the gods&quot;. The lake also retains its Ainu name in a shortened form, as Kamuyto or &quot;lake of the gods&quot;.

==Volcanic caldera==
Mashū formed less than 32,000 years ago. The caldera is the remains of a stratovolcano, which is actually a parasitic cone of the larger Lake Kussharo caldera. The eruption that created the current caldera occurred around 7,000 years ago. The last eruption was a plinian eruption about 2,000 years ago that dropped pumice over the region.

Mashū volcano is rated with a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 6, the third highest among large volcanoes.

Two volcanoes have grown out of the Mashū caldera. Kamuishu Island, a lava dome which rises from the middle of the lake, is one. The other is Mount Kamui, a stratovolcano with lava dome, which forms the highest point on the eastern shore. A third volcano neighbors Kamuinupuri. It is Mount Nishibetsu. Mount Nishibetsu probably predates the caldera.

The main rock type of the volcanoes is andesite and dacite. The rock is non-alkali pyroclastic flow or mafic rock, dating from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene. Some rock around the Mashū crater and Mount Nishibetsu is older still, dating from the Middle Pleistocene.

The following table lists the eruptions of the Mashū volcano and Kamuinupuri.
==Flora and fauna==
The lake is inhabited by phytoplankton and zooplankton.
* &quot;Melosira&quot; spp.
* &quot;Synedra&quot; sp.
* &quot; Daphnia longispina&quot;
* &quot; Bosmina coregoni&quot;

Sockeye salmon and rainbow trout have been introduced to the lake.

On the slopes around and above the lake grow a mixture of evergreen forest with &quot;Picea jezoensis&quot; and &quot;Abies sachalinensis&quot; and birch forest with &quot;Betula ermanii&quot;.

The Mashu-dake Hiking Course is a trail that goes along the crater rim and to the top of Mount Mashū. The trail leads through forest and grassland for about seven kilometers and takes about 2.5 to 3 hours to hike one way. There are no settlements along the shores of the lake. Access to the lakeshore itself is prohibited by the Ministry of the Environment (Japan). Visitors may only view the lake from the designated observation towers.

== In popular culture ==
Sendoff Spring in &quot;Pokémon Diamond and Pearl&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Platinum&quot; is based on this lake as the Sinnoh region is a fictionalized version of Hokkaido.

<doc id="454355" wikidata="Q1931779" url="?curid=454355" title="Seniority">
<text>Seniority is the state of being older or placed in a higher position of status relative to another individual, group, or organization. For example, one employee may be senior to another either by role or rank (such as a CEO vice a manager), or by having more years served within the organization (such as one peer being accorded greater status over another due to amount of time in). The term &quot;seniority&quot; can apply to either concept or both concurrently.

== In armed forces ==

In some military command structures, the length of time someone has held a particular rank is called &quot;seniority in grade&quot; and determines whether that person is senior to another person of the same rank. For instance, a captain who was promoted five years ago can give orders to a captain who was promoted three years ago.

== In politics ==

Seniority in United States politics, when used out of context, is informally defined as the number of years one member of a group has been a part of the group. 

As of March 2022, Hal Rogers is Dean of the United States House of Representatives, the most senior member of the House of Representatives, having represented Kentucky since 1981 (21 terms). However, &quot;seniority&quot; can also refer to political power attained by position within the United States Government. 

* United States Order of Precedence
* United States presidential line of succession
* Seniority in the United States Senate

Seniority is viewed sometimes both positively and negatively. Many elected officials are viewed as retaining their position only because they have been there for many years, which can reflect voter stagnancy and the benefits of incumbency. On the other hand, long years of incumbency can also be seen as a sign of the person&#x27;s ability to continue pleasing voters or the use of seniority to deliver benefits to constituents.

In some countries the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps receives special treatment.

== In employment ==
In unionised companies, employees with more seniority may enjoy more work privileges. Here are examples: 
* Shift work at more favourable times
* Work that is deemed easier or more pleasurable
* Working hours at a more convenient time (convenience being relative to the employee)
* Assignment to work, when a work reduction, or a reduction in available work hours results in layoffs

Seniority also has an influence over bumping rights, which is a reassignment of jobs, possibly for many people at a time.

Some traditionalist employers, common in smaller, single-operated business, take a &quot;last in, first out&quot; (LIFO) - notably in the education sector - perspective, meaning those who have been there longest or who have tenure have the right to stay, whereas other employers take a &quot;first in, first out&quot; (FIFO) or &quot;inverse seniority&quot; viewpoint, which tends to emphasize a new or &quot;fresh start&quot; for the company.

Seniority does have several positive factors to its name. Individuals may be drawn toward a specific field or occupation with the knowledge that seniority is obtainable. If seniority were to be banished as a whole, many higher paid employees would be fired first just because they make more money than their peers. Seniority does an effective job in helping people, interested in staying at one organization, in working towards having a &quot;marathon&quot; career. One of the goals of a seniority system is employee retention, which ensures an organization is retaining institutional knowledge, erudite employees, and an opportunity for mentorship of new hires. It is important to make sure employees are here to stay. 

Though the principle of seniority does an effective job of protecting long-term employees, in some scenarios, it can fail to address several critical factors. Firstly, spots secured by seniority casts aside some of the most appealing perspectives. Individuals will become less driven to enter a field that does not reinforce their efforts with employment. Secondly, the security of tenure often encourages mediocrity. Employees with the knowledge that their spot in the workplace is secured will naturally become less likely to improve their working ethics as they may no longer view improvement as a necessity. Lastly, a system rewarding individuals for their hiring date does not encourage professional growth. If individuals are aware they only have to reach a certain time-span of employment to have a guaranteed position in a company, they will not grow professionally once they have reached their mark. 

During the late 20th century in the United States, the federal government stopped emphasizing seniority as the primary basis for pay raises for its workforce. The Reagan administration replaced a seniority-based system for pay increases for its white collar government workers. The new system included performance appraisal. 

In personnel economics, some researchers take the view that seniority pay is employed by firms as a solution to the problem of shirking. Since firms cannot always monitor the effort of their employees, they need to introduce an incentive for their employees to keep up the work. One way firms can accomplish this is through delayed compensation, in which employees are paid below the value of what they are producing in the first years at a firm, and paid above the value of their production in later years. The continuous rising of the wage based on seniority at the firm ensures that shirking, which can lead to dismissal, becomes much more costly for employees due to the loss of the high wages they can expect when staying at a firm for a long time.

=== Bumping rights ===
Some collective agreements include so called bumping provision (also known as bumping rights. The bumping involves a senior employee whose job position is being eliminated to displace a junior worker from their job. The junior employee thus losing the job might then &quot;bump&quot; another, even more junior, person. Bumping rights usually come with restrictions, like requirement of a minimum period of employment before bumping is possible, allowing only moves to positions previously held, or limiting the departments or jobs where the bumping can occur.

=== In transport ===
Commercial aviation pilots working for a carrier have their privileges determined by their seniority or generally known as the &quot;pilot seniority list.&quot; These privileges can be income level, routes flown, types of aircraft, work schedules and positions. Seniority is most important when deciding which pilots to upgrade to a larger, more complex aircraft type; or for upgrading a First Officer to the rank of a Captain.

Engine drivers with many railways also have a seniority list, but it is focused on work scheduling. Younger engine drivers often serve as back-up personnel and must help out on a very short notice – for example when a colleague calls in sick or has a delay.

<text>William Elford Leach (2 February 1791 – 25 August 1836) was an English zoologist and marine biologist.

==Life and work==

Elford Leach was born at Hoe Gate, Plymouth, the son of an attorney. At the age of twelve he began a medical apprenticeship at the Devonshire and Exeter Hospital, studying anatomy and chemistry. By this time he was already collecting marine animals from Plymouth Sound and along the Devon coast. At seventeen he began studying medicine at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London, finishing his training at the University of Edinburgh before graduating MD from the University of St Andrews (where he had never studied).

From 1813 Leach concentrated on his zoological interests and was employed as an &#x27;Assistant Librarian&#x27; (what would later be called Assistant Keeper) in the Natural History Department of the British Museum, where he had responsibility for the zoological collections. Here he threw himself into the task of reorganising and modernising these collections, many of which had been neglected since Hans Sloane left them to the nation. In 1815, he published the first bibliography of entomology in Brewster&#x27;s &quot;Edinburgh Encyclopedia&quot; (see Timeline of entomology – 1800–1850). He also worked and published on other invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds. and was the naturalist who separated the centipedes and millipedes from the insects, giving them their own group, the Myriapoda. In his day he was the world&#x27;s leading expert on the Crustacea and was in contact with scientists in the United States and throughout Europe. In 1816 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society at the age of 25.

However, in 1821 he suffered a nervous breakdown due to overwork and became unable to continue his researches. He resigned from the museum in March 1822 and his elder sister Jane took him to continental Europe to convalesce. They lived in Italy and (briefly) Malta and he died from cholera in San Sebastiano Curone, near Tortona, north of Genoa on 25 August 1836.

In 1837 Dr Francis Boott, secretary of the Linnean Society of London, wrote, &quot;Few men have ever devoted themselves to zoology with greater zeal than Dr Leach, or attained at an early period of life a higher reputation at home and abroad as a profound naturalist. He was one of the most laborious and successful, as well as one of the most universal, cultivators of zoology which this country has ever produced.&quot;

==Legacy==
Despite his expertise in particular animal groups, Leach&#x27;s greatest contribution was his almost single-handed modernisation of the whole of British zoology following its stagnation during the long war with post-revolutionary and Napoleonic France.

In Britain zoologists remained committed to the system of animal classification introduced by Linnaeus in the middle of the 18th century. This was a powerful tool but its principles led to artificial groupings of species when creating larger groups such as genera and families. For example, Linnaeus had called all animals encased in a hard outer skeleton, insects. He therefore grouped butterflies with lobsters, scorpions, spiders and centipedes but these animals are not otherwise similar in appearance, do not live in the same environment, and do not behave in the same way. The grouping does separate animals with hard outer skeletons from jellyfish, worms, snails, vertebrates, etc. but does not produce a group &#x27;Insecta&#x27; with clear similarities shared by all its members.

In continental Europe in the late 18th century naturalists began to revise the way they grouped species. They used a wider array of characters, not just one or two, and began to discern groups of species that physically resembled one another, lived in similar ways and occupied similar habitats. They created new genera to house these coherent groups and referred to these as &#x27;natural genera&#x27;. They named this approach the &#x27;natural method&#x27; or &#x27;natural system&#x27; of classification.

Unlike many of his countrymen, Leach was aware of these developments across the English Channel. He read the French literature and, despite the war with France, corresponded with the zoologists in Paris. He applied the new principles to his own research and brought them to the attention of other British zoologists through his publications. Between the years 1813 and 1830 he produced more than 130 scientific articles and books. By applying the natural method in these works he created more than 380 new genera, many of which have stood the test of time and remain valid today.

In 1834, at the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Leonard Jenyns reported on &quot;The Recent Progress and Present State of Zoology&quot;. Discussing the science in the years before 1817 he noted the advances made on the Continent, then continued, &#x27;England, we fear, has but little to produce as the result of her labours in zoology during the same period. Our countrymen were too much riveted to the principles of the Linnaean school to appreciate the value of the natural system ... There was a general repugnance to everything that appeared like an innovation on the system of Linnaeus; and for many years ... zoology, which was making rapid strides in France and other parts of the Continent, remained in this country nearly stationary. It is mainly to Dr Leach that we are indebted for having opened the eyes of English zoologists to the importance of those principles which had long guided the French naturalists. Whilst he greatly contributed to the advancement of the natural system by his own researches, he gave a turn to those of others, and made the first step towards weaning his countrymen from the school they had so long adhered to.&#x27;

Two years later, the year of Leach&#x27;s death, the House of Commons completed a detailed investigation of the management of the British Museum. During their interviews the MPs had received confirmation from John Edward Gray that it was Leach who, &quot;was the first to make the English acquainted, by his works and by his improved manner of arranging the collections of the Museum, with the progress that had been made in natural science on the Continent. Thus a new impetus was given to zoology&quot;. Edward Griffiths (translator of George Cuvier&#x27;s &quot;Le Règne Animal&quot;) told the inquiry that in Britain, before Leach&#x27;s work, &quot;zoology was utterly neglected; 20 years ago it was anything but popular; certainly there were very few amateurs that paid much attention to it.&quot; &quot;In your judgment,&quot; the committee proposed, &quot;Dr Leach has the eminent credit of having raised the science of zoology in England?&quot; &quot;Indeed I think so&quot; replied Griffiths.

In his short career Leach had brought British zoology back to the cutting edge of the subject and as a consequence had put the next generation of British zoologists on much firmer ground. The next generation of British zoologists contained both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace.

Despite his impact, today Elford Leach is remembered mainly in the scientific names of the many species that honour him. In the years up to 1850 alone 137 new species were named &quot;leachii&quot;, &quot;leachiana&quot;, &quot;leachella&quot;, &quot;elfordii&quot;, &quot;elfordiana&quot; and other variants.

Leach is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of lizards, &quot;Anolis leachii&quot; and &quot;Rhacodactylus leachianus&quot;.

In the non-scientific literature he is honoured in the common names of several species. Leach&#x27;s storm-petrel was named after him by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1820 and the blue-winged kookaburra, &quot;Dacelo leachii&quot;, is also known as Leach&#x27;s kookaburra. Leach created the genus &quot;Dacelo&quot; for the kookaburras in 1815.

==Leach&#x27;s nomenclature==
Leach&#x27;s nomenclature was often personal – he named nineteen species and one genus after his employee and friend John Cranch, who had died while collecting the species in Africa on the expedition of HMS &quot;Congo&quot;. He named nine genera after an unknown woman called Caroline, using anagrams of that name and the Latinised form Carolina, for example: &quot;Cirolana&quot;, &quot;Conilera&quot; and &quot;Rocinela&quot;. These include the marine isopod crustacean &quot;Cirolana cranchi&quot; which he named in 1818 after both Caroline and Cranch.

==Bibliography==
Leach&#x27;s written works during his time at the British Museum include the following:
* &quot;The Zoological Miscellany&quot; (1814–1817)
* &quot;Monograph on the British Crabs, Lobsters, Prawns and other Crustacea with pedunculated eyes&quot; (1815–1820)
* &quot;Systematic catalogue of the Specimens of the Indigenous Mammalia and Birds that are preserved at the British Museum&quot; (1816)
* &quot;Synopsis of the Mollusca of Great Britain&quot; (circulated 1820, but not published until 1852)

<text>Robert Swinhoe FRS (1 September 1836 – 28 October 1877) was an English diplomat and naturalist who worked as a Consul in Qing-era Taiwan (then known to Westerners as Formosa). He catalogued many Southeast Asian birds, and several, such as Swinhoe&#x27;s pheasant, are named after him.

==Biography==
Swinhoe was born in colonial-era Kolkata (then known as Calcutta) where his father, who came from a Northumberland family, was a lawyer. There is no clear record of the date of his arrival in England, but it is known he attended the University of London, and in 1854, joined the China consular corps.

He was stationed to the remote port of Amoy, some 300 miles to the northeast of Hong Kong, in 1855. While at this port, he not only mastered the Chinese language (both official Mandarin and the local Amoy dialect), but also initiated a detailed and authoritative understanding of the ornithology of eastern China. In March 1856, Swinhoe made an &quot;adventurous&quot; visit to the camphor districts of northwestern Taiwan on board a lorcha, a hybrid vessel utilizing a European hull and Chinese rigging. Whether this was an official or a personal visit is unknown, but he made mention of it on several occasions through the rest of his published career. While at Amoy he courted and married Christina Stronach (née Lockie), the daughter of a Scottish missionary, in 1857.

In June and July 1858, Swinhoe participated in the circumnavigation of Taiwan on board HMS &quot;Inflexible&quot; in search of British and American castaways. He served as translator as well in two subsequent British actions against the Chinese in North China in 1858 and 1860, the latter resulting in his book &quot;The North China Campaign of 1860&quot; (London, 1861), his personal account of the Second Opium War.

In 1860, Swinhoe was named as the first European consular representative to the island of Taiwan. Delays prevented him from physically obtaining that post until 1861. On 2 July of that year, Swinhoe and his assistant, George C. P. Braune (1838-1864), arrived at the prefectural capital, the southern city of Taiwan-fu (now Tainan). Shoaling of the harbor at Taiwan-fu prompted him to re-establish the British consulate at the northern port of Tamsui, where the bulk of foreign trade occurred. He published several articles on his first harried days as British representative in Taiwan, and as well numerous others on the rich wildlife of this isolated island.

Subsequently, he served as consul at Amoy, Ningbo, and Yantai, all on the mainland of China. He, at various times during his career, served as &#x27;roving consul&#x27; for the British plenipotentiary in China for Great Britain, Rutherford Alcock. His duties in this capacity required a visit to explore Hainan, as well as a journey up the Yangtze River to Chongqing, in Sichuan Province, to help determine steamship navigability of that river. All the while he was stationed at those various postings, he retained the Taiwanese consulship, and indeed did not relinquish it until his retirement from the service of his government, in 1873. He spent his spare time in China collecting natural history specimens, and as the area had not previously been open to Westerners, many of the items he collected were new to science. As he was primarily an ornithologist, many of his new discoveries were birds, but he also found new fish, mammals and insects. He returned to England in 1862 with his collection. Many of the birds were first described in John Gould&#x27;s &quot;Birds of Asia&quot; (1863).

==Natural history==

At a young age, he had been interested in birds and had made a small collection of British birds, nests and eggs. He corresponded with Henry Stevenson and one of his first publications was in 1858, the year in which Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published their papers on natural selection. Swinhoe took to the ideas of Darwin and in 1872, he named a species (now a subspecies) after Darwin (&quot;Pucrasia macrolopha darwini&quot;). He was a regular contributor to &quot;The Ibis&quot; after 1860 and later to the &quot;Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London&quot;.

During his travels, he studied the birds and mammals apart from studying the local culture. He collected both live animals and specimens on his travels and regularly sent them to the London Zoo. The first Pere David&#x27;s deer in Europe came from him.

His primary interest was however in birds and on these he corresponded extensively with Edward Blyth. Around 1871, he started suffering from partial paralysis and he moved to the Yantai which he called the &quot;Scarborough of China&quot;. He was forced by his ill health to leave China in October 1875. From his home in Chelsea, he continued to publish notes and his last publication in &quot;The Ibis&quot; was the description of a new genus and species of bird &quot;Liocichla steerii&quot;. He died at the age of 41, presumably of syphilis.

P. L. Sclater described him as &quot;one of the most industrious and successful exploring naturalists that have ever lived&quot; and after his death, A. R. Wallace wrote &quot;due to Mr. Swinhoe&#x27;s own exertions...there is probably no part of the world (if we except Europe, North America, and British India) of whose warm-blooded vertebrates we possess fuller or more accurate knowledge than we do of the coast districts of China and its islands.&quot;

His collection of 3,700 specimens was bought by Henry Seebohm and this was subsequently bequeathed to the Liverpool Museum.

Four species of mammals and 15 species of birds were named after Swinhoe, including Swinhoe&#x27;s storm-petrel, which he first described himself in 1867. Also, four species of reptiles are named in his honor: &quot;Gekko swinhonis, Diploderma swinhonis, Rhabdophis swinhonis&quot;, and the Yangtze giant softshell turtle (&quot;Rafetus swinhoei)&quot;, a specimen of which John Edward Gray received from Swinhoe in 1873.

One of Robert&#x27;s brothers, Colonel Charles Swinhoe was a founding member of the Bombay Natural History Society in India and an expert on Lepidoptera.

<text>Jack Wild (30 September 1952 – 1 March 2006) was an English actor and singer. He is best known for his role as the Artful Dodger in the film &quot;Oliver!&quot; (1968), for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the age of 16, becoming the fourth-youngest nominee in the category. He also received BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for the role.

Wild also starred in the television series &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot; (1969) and its film adaptation &quot;Pufnstuf&quot; (1970), as well as in the films &quot;Melody&quot; (1971) and &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; (1991).

==Early life and education==
Wild was born into a working-class family in Royton, Lancashire, on 30 September 1952. In 1960, at the age of eight, with his parents and his elder brother Arthur, he moved to Hounslow, in Middlesex, where he got a job helping a milkman, which paid about five shillings. While playing football with his brother in the park, he was discovered by theatrical agent June Collins, mother of Phil Collins. June Collins enrolled both Jack and Arthur at the Barbara Speake Stage School, an independent school in Acton, west London.

== Acting career ==

===&quot;Oliver!&quot;===

The Wild brothers sought acting roles to supplement their parents&#x27; income. In the autumn of 1964, the pair were cast in the West End theatre production of Lionel Bart&#x27;s &quot;Oliver!&quot; – Arthur in the title role and Jack as Charley Bates, a member of Fagin&#x27;s gang. Wild was chosen to play the Artful Dodger for the 1968 movie version of &quot;Oliver!&quot; His performance received critical acclaim and several nominations:

*Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor – nominated at the 41st Academy Awards
*Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer – nominated at 26th Golden Globe Awards
*BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer – nominated at 22nd British Academy Film Awards

===TV work===

In the spring of 1966, Wild left the stage show of &quot;Oliver!&quot; to make the film serial &quot;Danny the Dragon&quot; for the Children&#x27;s Film Foundation. Wild&#x27;s first speaking roles on TV were in an episode of &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;, and in the third part of the BBC&#x27;s version of the Wesker trilogy, &quot;I&#x27;m Talking About Jerusalem&quot;. He also appeared in episodes of &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, &quot;The Newcomers&quot;, and &quot;George and the Dragon&quot;.

===After &quot;Oliver!&quot;===
At the 1968 premiere of &quot;Oliver!&quot;, Wild met brothers Sid and Marty Krofft, who thought he would make a good lead for a show they were developing called &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot;. Wild starred as Jimmy in Pufnstuf&#x27;s only season (1969), as well as in the film &quot;Pufnstuf&quot; (1970), which was released shortly after the show was concluded. 

Wild then appeared in &quot;Melody&quot; (1971, with &quot;Oliver!&quot; co-star Mark Lester) and &quot;Flight of the Doves&quot; (1971, with another &quot;Oliver!&quot; co-star, Ron Moody). In 1972, Wild appeared as a stowaway in an episode of BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;The Onedin Line&quot;. In 1973, he played Reg in &quot;The 14&quot;, a film directed by David Hemmings. On television, Wild appeared in a BBC adaptation of &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; in 1976. During the early 1970s, Wild was considered a teen heartthrob, alongside David Cassidy and Barry Williams. In 1999, Wild lamented, &quot;When I first entered in the show business, of course I didn&#x27;t mind playing younger roles. However, it did bug me when I would be 21 being offered the role of a 13-year-old. I&#x27;m not saying I didn&#x27;t enjoy playing these roles; I had barrels of fun, I just wanted more serious and dramatic roles; it&#x27;s that simple.&quot; 

He also embarked on a recording career, releasing &quot;The Jack Wild Album&quot; for Capitol Records, which contained the single &quot;Some Beautiful&quot;. In the early 1970s, Wild also released the albums &quot;Everything&#x27;s Coming Up Roses&quot; and &quot;Beautiful World&quot; for Buddah Records.

===Later career===
Wild returned to the big screen in a few minor roles, such as in the 1991 Kevin Costner film &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; and as a peddler in &quot;Basil&quot; (1998). For the most part, he spent the remainder of his career working in theatre. Wild&#x27;s last major appearance was as the male lead, Mouse, in Tayla Goodman&#x27;s rock musical &quot;Virus&quot;. The show ran for two weeks at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham, in 1999. For his final film appearance, he had a minor role in &quot;Moussaka &amp; Chips&quot; (2005), in which he once again worked with Ron Moody.

==Personal life==
Wild first met Welsh-born actress Gaynor Jones when they were around 12 years old at the Barbara Speake stage school. After he left in 1966, he did not see her again until Christmas 1970. They married on 14 February 1976. She left him in 1985 because of his chronic drinking. Wild met his second wife, Claire Harding, when he was working with her in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; in Worthing. They married in Bedford in September 2005. In 2001, Wild was diagnosed with oral cancer; he blamed the disease on his drinking and smoking habits. He underwent chemotherapy immediately, and had his tongue and voice box removed in July 2004, leaving him unable to speak. Wild had to communicate through his wife for the rest of his life.

===Alcoholism===
By 21, Wild was an alcoholic. After exhausting his remaining fortune, he lived with his retired father for a few years. His alcoholism caused three cardiac arrests and resulted in numerous hospital stays. He was diagnosed with diabetes on 14 March 1983. His alcoholism ruined both his career and first marriage as his, wife left him in 1985 because of his drinking. 

During the mid-1980s, he often drank three to four bottles of vodka a week, and typically drank half a bottle of vodka and two bottles of wine every day. He later admitted his alcoholism was so debilitating that he was incapable of performing any kind of work. He once attended a drying-out clinic for drug addicts and alcoholics, run by Pete Townshend, but after being &quot;dry&quot; for six weeks, he bought a bottle of champagne to celebrate that he had stopped drinking. Wild eventually became sober on 6 March 1989, after joining a support group, &quot;Alcoholics Victorious&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Wild died on 1 March 2006 of oral cancer. He is buried in Toddington Parish Cemetery, Bedfordshire. He had been unable to speak for the last two years of his life following the operation in which his vocal cords and part of his tongue were removed.

At the time of his death, he and his wife had been working on his autobiography. She said: &quot;All the material was there when Jack died, it just needed rearranging, editing, and in certain sections, writing out from transcripts Jack and I made as we recorded him talking about his life.&quot; The book, &quot;It&#x27;s a Dodger&#x27;s Life&quot;, was published in 2016 with a foreword by &quot;Pufnstuf&quot; co-star Billie Hayes, an afterword by Clive Francis, and an epilogue by Wild&#x27;s wife.

<doc id="454370" wikidata="Q11067" url="?curid=454370" title="Banyuwangi Regency">
<text>Banyuwangi Regency (, ) is a regency of East Java province in Indonesia. This regency also known as &quot;the sun rise of Java&quot; because it is located at the easternmost end of Java Island. The town of Banyuwangi serves as a port for ferry services between Java and Bali. The regency is surrounded by mountains and forests to the west; by sea to the east and south - is separated by the Strait of Bali from Bali. With an area of 5,782.5 km2, this regency is by far the largest on the island of Java. The regency is a tourist destination, and subject to ongoing development as an international tourist destination with relevant infrastructure. Banyuwangi regency has been declared a taman bumi (earth park), or national geological park (Geopark) in 2018.

It had a population of 1,488,791 according to the 2000 Census; by the 2010 Census it had risen to 1,556,078; and at the 2020 Census to 1,708,114; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 1,780,015 (comprising 888,288 males and 891,727 females). The town of Banyuwangi is the administrative capital. The name Banyuwangi is Javanese for &quot;fragrant waters&quot;, connected to the Javanese folklore of Sri Tanjung.

==Society and history==
One Banyuwangi native group is the Osing community which has a Hindu culture although they can be considered as a Javanese sub-ethnic group. They live mainly in the central part of Banyuwangi and they sometimes consider themselves as Majapahit descendants. Other groups are Javanese (living mostly in the south and west), Madurese (mainly in the north and coastal area) and Balinese (scattered but more concentrated in the east). Other smaller groups include Chinese, Buginese, and Arabs.

Once known as Blambangan (or its variation: Balambangan and Balumbungan), it was a vassal of the Majapahit Kingdom and a regional trade centre. Blambangan&#x27;s autonomy grew considerably after the end of 14th century A.D. After the Majapahit Kingdom ceased to exist, it became an independent kingdom and, as such, the last Hindu kingdom of Java. In order to defend itself from the troops of the Sultanate of Demak, which tried to occupy it, Blambangan asked for help from Balinese kings, which caused it to lose its independence to Balinese kingdoms. During this time Blambangan was deeply influenced by Balinese culture. After around 150 years of Balinese occupation, the Sultanate of Mataram gained control of the territory and renamed it Banyuwangi. Tawang alun II of Balmbangan freed Balmbangan from Mataram sultanate during Trunojoyo revolt and built the capital of Macan Putih , near modern day Banyuwangi . Later, it was part of the Mataram territory controlled by the VOC (1770). During the expansion of plantations in the 19th century, many parts of Banyuwangi were planted with coffee and sugar cane, which feature its landscape even now. The Chinese and Arabs came mostly during this period.

Banyuwangi people are known for their combination of Islamic and pre-Islamic tradition.

During the Fall of Suharto, a witchhunt in Banyuwangi against alleged sorcerers spiraled into widespread riots and violence. In addition to alleged sorcerers, Islamic clerics were also targeted and killed, and Nahdlatul Ulama members were murdered by rioters.

==Culture==
The Blambangan Peninsula is one of the remaining places in Java where Hindu culture is still retained, having a Balinese influence. 
===Gandrung Dance===

This is a Banyuwangi-typical dance performed by a woman, accompanied with simple music from a violin, triangle (called ), gong (or kempul), kendhang and sometimes keyboard as result of modern influence. It is performed during night until dawn, particularly in parties.

===Janger or Damarwulan===
Damarwulan is a legendary hero who features in traditional theatre art, which has been developed since the 19th century in Banyuwangi. It is a combination of Balinese, Javanese and local cultures. Balinese influences can be seen in its performers&#x27; costumes and instruments. Meanwhile, Javanese influences is in its &quot;lakon&quot; or stories as well as language in dialogues. It is distinct from the Balinese Janger.

==Administrative districts==

There are 3 waterfalls near to each other known as the &quot;Triple Waterfall&quot; to be found 10 minutes walk down the stairs from a parking area. Or about 300 meters along the river, walking uphill, Kethagen Waterfall can be found. The cliff besides the river can reflect sunlight, glittering like diamonds.

==Climate==
Banyuwangi has a temperate tropical and wet dry climate, similar to Banyuwangi&#x27;s dry season start from May until October, and the rest is wet season. in 2013, Banyuwangi&#x27;s highest average temperature is on October with 28.2 °C and lowest average temperature is on April with 24.8 °C

==Environment==
The forest and river in Banyuwangi is well-preserved, says the Indonesia Dragonfly Society because they found 3 dragonfly species which only can live in good environment.

Nevertheless, there are local controversies in the Regency over the impact of gold mining activities in the locality of Tumpang Pitu village. In 2006, the Banywangi regency administration granted a mining licence to one company, PT Indo Multi Niaga, which later transferred the licence to another company. However, the local community had expressed concern about gold mining activities as early as 1997. The issues partly related to the protection of the area around a local Hindu temple, partly relate to environmental matters, and partly related to local community views about the economic and social impact of the mining.
In addition, in Banyuwangi town, Kertosari &quot;kelurahan&quot; has a Multimedia training center for Vocational High Schools (Vocational High Schools) in Industrial Work Practices in the field of Television, through a place where millennials are creative who are members of Misntv (Media Inspirasi Sahabat Nusantara Televisi). This media is a Media Streaming Network, under the auspices of Mav Entertainment Corporation and Lembaga Sahadat-Qu, which aims to create a new workforce in the field of Television and Journalism that is reliable. The location of the Misntv office is on Jl. Ikan Banyar No. 91 RT. 03 RW. 03 Krajan Kertosari. Hopefully with this training center it can improve the economy at the UMKM level and the younger generation is able to compete in the digital era.

<text>A menstrual cup is a menstrual hygiene device which is inserted into the vagina during menstruation. Its purpose is to collect menstrual fluid (blood from the uterine lining mixed with other fluids). Menstrual cups are made of elastomers (silicone rubbers, latex rubbers, or thermoplastic rubbers). A properly fitting menstrual cup seals against the vaginal walls, so tilting and inverting the body will not cause it to leak. It is impermeable and collects menstrual fluid, unlike tampons and menstrual pads, which absorb it.

Menstrual cups come in two types. The older type is bell-shaped, often with a stem, and has walls more than 2mm thick. The second type has a springy rim, and attached to the rim, a bowl with thin, flexible walls. Bell-shaped cups sit over the cervix, like cervical caps, but they are generally larger than cervical caps and cannot be worn during vaginal sex. Ring-shaped cups sit in the same position as a contraceptive diaphragm; they do not block the vagina and can be worn during vaginal sex. Menstrual cups are not meant to prevent pregnancy.

Every 4–12 hours (depending on capacity and the amount of flow), the cup is emptied (usually removed, rinsed, and reinserted). After each period, the cup requires cleaning. One cup may be reusable for up to 10 years, making their long-term cost lower than that of disposable tampons or pads, though the initial cost is higher. As menstrual cups are reusable, they generate less solid waste than tampons and pads, both from the products themselves and from their packaging. Bell-shaped cups have to fit fairly precisely; it is common for users to get a perfect fit from the second cup they buy, by judging the misfit of the first cup. Ring-shaped cups are one-size-fits-most, but some manufacturers sell multiple sizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;disc/cup&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Reported leakage for menstrual cups is similar or rarer than for tampons and pads. It is possible to urinate, defecate, sleep, swim, do gymnastics, run, ride bicycles or riding animals, weightlift, and do heavy exercise while wearing a menstrual cup. Incorrect placement or cup size can cause leakage. Most users initially find menstrual cups difficult, uncomfortable, and even painful to insert and remove. This generally gets better within 3–4 months of use; having friends who successfully use menstrual cups helps, but there is a shortage of research on factors that ease the learning curve. Menstrual cups are a safe alternative to other menstrual products; risk of toxic shock syndrome infection is similar or lower with menstrual cups than for pads or tampons.

== Terminology ==

The terminology used for menstrual cups is sometimes inconsistent. This article uses &quot;menstrual cup&quot; to mean all types, and for clarity, distinguishes the two main types as &quot;bell-shaped&quot; and &quot;ring-shaped&quot;. 

The thick-walled bell-shaped cups are the older type, and the term &quot;menstrual cup&quot; is sometimes used to refer only to bell-shaped cups. But in modern formal contexts, such as academic research and regulations, &quot;menstrual cup&quot; usually refers to both types.

The US Food and Drug Administration holds that &quot;A menstrual cup is a receptacle placed in the vagina to collect menstrual flow.&quot; The EU legislated that &quot;The product group ‘reusable menstrual cups’ shall comprise reusable flexible cups or barriers worn inside the body whose function is to retain and collect menstrual fluid, and which are made of silicone or other elastomers.&quot;

Ring-shaped cups are also called &quot;menstrual discs&quot; and sometimes &quot;menstrual rings&quot;, to distinguish them from bell-shaped cups. Bell-shaped cups are sometimes called &quot;menstrual bells&quot;.

Because bell-shaped cups are commonly depicted as being placed in the vaginal canal, well below the cervix, they are also called &quot;vaginal cups&quot;, with the ring-shaped cups called &quot;cervical cups&quot;. This may not clearly reflect their position in the body. MRI imaging suggests that, contrary to some manufacturer&#x27;s depictions, the bell-shaped cups called &quot;vaginal cups&quot; are placed over the cervix, in a position similar to a cervical cap (not to be confused with a cervical &quot;cup&quot;). Ring-shaped cups, called &quot;cervical cups&quot;, also cover the cervix, but have one edge next to the cervix, and the other located further down the vagina, so that the cup is nearly parallel to the long axis of the vagina.

In the 1800s, menstrual cups were called &quot;&#x27;catamenial sacks&quot;, and were similar external catamenial sacks of &quot;canoe-like form&quot;, which in turn were similar to catamenial sacks which were waterproof rubber undersheet supports for absorbent pads. These were made from india-rubber or gutta-percha, forms of latex.

== Use ==
Menstrual cups are favoured by backpackers and other travellers, as they are easy to pack and only one is needed.

Thorough washing of the cup and hands helps to avoid introducing new bacteria into the vagina, which may heighten the risk of UTIs and other infections. Disposable and reusable pads do not demand the same hand hygiene, though reusable pads also require access to water for washing out pads.

If the hands have come into contact with any chemical that directly trigger sensory receptors in the skin, such as menthol or capsaicin, all traces of the chemical should be removed before touching the mucous membranes.

A UN spec recommends that cups should not be shared; they should only ever be used by one person.

===Insertion===


The vagina is narrowest at the entrance and becomes wider and easier to stretch further in. Menstrual cups are folded or compressed to insert them, and then opened out once inside. The innermost portion of the cup typically goes into the vaginal fornix (the groove around the cervix). Menstrual cups cannot pass through the cervix into the uterus.

The muscles of the pelvic floor, which surround the vaginal entrance, are relaxed to let the cup pass. Involuntarily tensing the vaginal muscles can make it impossible for anything to enter the vagina without causing pain. Many initially find insertion difficult, uncomfortable, and even painful, but learn to do it within a few cycles. There is little publicly available research on learning to use menstrual cups which compares types of cup or instructions.

A bell-shaped cup is folded or pinched before being inserted into the vagina. There are various folding techniques for insertion; common folds include the &quot;C&quot; fold, the &quot;7&quot; fold, and the punch-down fold. Once inside, the cup will normally unfold automatically and seal against the vaginal wall. In some cases, the user may need to twist the cup or flex the vaginal muscles to ensure the cup is fully open.

In practice, the rim of a bell-shaped cup generally sits in the vaginal fornix, the ring-shaped hollow around the cervix. Some fornixes are much deeper than others. Those with deeper fornixes may use insertion techniques such as inserting the cup partway, opening it before the rim passes the cervix, and then pushing it up into place; or they may press the cup to one side and let it open slowly, the rim slipping over the cervix. If correctly sized and inserted, the cup should not leak or cause any discomfort. The stem should be completely inside the vagina. If it can&#x27;t be positioned inside, the cup can be removed and the stem trimmed.

Ring-shaped cups (also called menstrual discs or menstrual rings) are inserted differently than bell-shaped cups: by squeezing opposite sides of the rim together until they touch, sliding the inner end of the folded cup to the end of the vaginal canal, and tucking the outer end behind the pubic bone. They can be less bulky than a bell-shaped cup, no bulkier than a tampon. Inserting a ring-shaped cup requires more knowledge of anatomy, to get the cup under and around the cervix, not rucked up in front of it. Ring-shaped cups with non-circular rims are designed to be inserted with the widest, deepest part going in first. If they are inserted the wrong way around they may leak. If there are stems or other removal aids, they should be on the end inserted last.

If lubricant is used for insertion, it should be water-based, as silicone lubricant can be damaging to the silicone.

=== Wear ===
A bell-shaped cup may protrude far enough to be uncomfortable if it is too long. It may press too firmly against the bladder, causing discomfort, frequent urination, or difficulty urinating, if it is too firm, or the wrong shape. A bell-shaped cup may leak if it is not inserted correctly, and does not pop open completely and seal against the walls of the vagina. Some factors mentioned in association with leakage included menorrhagia, unusual anatomy of the uterus, need for a larger size of menstrual cup, and incorrect placement of the menstrual cup, or that it had filled to capacity. However, a proper seal may continue to contain fluid in the upper vagina even if the cup is full.

While many diagrams show bell-shaped menstrual cups very low in the vagina, with the vagina gaping open, in-vivo imaging shows that the cups sit high, with their rim around the cervix, and the vagina squishes shut below the cup, sealing it inside the body.

If a ring-shaped cup pops out at the outermost edge, either the innermost edge got caught on near side of the cervix rather than tucked into the fornix behind it, or it is too big, or the outermost edge hasn&#x27;t been tucked behind the public bone firmly enough. In either any case it will leak. If it comes loose and starts to slide out when using the toilet, or leaks on exertion (when exercising, coughing, or sneezing), it is too large or too small. Some deliberately choose a ring-shaped cup which will leak when they deliberately bear down on it, but not at any other time.

=== Emptying ===

It is possible to deliberately empty a ring-shaped menstrual disc by muscular effort, without removing it (provided it is of a fairly soft material, and the right size). This is done in a suitable location, such as when sitting on a toilet. Bell-shaped cups must be removed to empty them.

The cup is emptied after 4–12 hours of use (or when it is full). Leaving the cup in for at least 3–4 hours allows the menstrual fluid to provide some lubrication.

If sewers are available, menstrual cups can be emptied into a flush toilet, or sink, bath, or shower drain, and the drain rinsed with water. They can also be emptied into a pit latrine.

When using a urine-diverting dry toilet, menstrual blood can be emptied into the part that receives the feces. If any menstrual blood falls into the funnel for urine, it can be rinsed away with water.

In the absence of other facilities, menstrual fluid can be emptied into a cathole. This is a single-use hole deep, more than from water (and frequented areas like trails or campsites), ideally dug in organic soil, in an area where the waste will break down fast. Water used to rinse the cup can also be disposed of in the cathole, which is then refilled and concealed.

===Removal===
Many initially find removal difficult, uncomfortable, and even painful, but learn to do it without problems within a few cycles.

The muscles of the pelvic floor are kept relaxed, to allow the cup to pass out through them. Techniques like squatting, putting a leg up on the toilet seat, spreading the knees, and bearing down on the cup as if giving birth are sometimes used to make removal easier. Because vaginal tenting can make the cup harder to remove, some manufacturers recommend waiting at least an hour after sex before removal.

Slow removal and a firm grip avoid dropping the cup; experience, time and privacy also help. Dropping the cup can contaminate it (see cleaning, below). If a cup is removed or emptied over a pit latrine, it may fall in and be unretrievable.

A bell-shaped cup is removed by reaching up to its stem to find the base. Simply pulling on the stem does not break the seal, and yanking on it can cause pain. To release the seal, the base of the cup is pinched, or a finger is placed alongside the cup. The exception is two-part cups with separate stems; those &quot;can&quot; be pulled out to break the seal. The shape of the (one-part) stem thus has little effect on how easy the cup is to remove, and many people trim the stem right off for comfort. The cup is removed slowly; rocking or wriggling it gently may help. Some fold the cup in a &quot;C&quot; fold before removal, to break the seal and reduce the bulk; folding the cup inside the body is generally more difficult than folding it outside.

A cup can be removed over a toilet, bath, or shower to catch spills. Removal becomes less messy with practice, and it is possible to consistently remove bell-shaped cup without spilling, by keeping it upright. If it is necessary to track the amount of menses produced (e.g., for medical reasons), a bell-shaped cup allows one to do so accurately before emptying.

Ring-shaped menstrual cups are removed by hooking the rim with a finger (from either side), or by pinching it with multiple fingers and pulling. Some ring-shaped cups have a dimple in the bowl, to make it easier to hook the rim from below. Some also have stems, but contrary to bell-shaped cups, these stems attach to the rim of the cup, and can be pulled to break the seal. Others have pull loops that fold flat against the bowl, which can also be pulled to remove. Removing ring-shaped cups is typically done over a toilet in case of spilling; the softer bowl squishes flat during removal, making it very difficult not to spill any menstruum. Removal aids like pull loops can make ring-shaped cups easier to remove without spilling, but they still tend to be messier than bell-shaped cups.
=== Cleaning ===
There is little published or independent research on how to clean menstrual cups. Manufacturers generally provide cleaning instructions, but they differ widely. Manufacturers did not provide any evidence validating or giving a rationale for the various cleaning instructions, as of 2022. A UN specification says that &quot;The cup must be washed frequently in clean, boiling water as per manufacturer&#x27;s instructions.&quot;

In response to the 2022 review of manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations (next section), which said there was no published evidence on how well cleaning methods work, a single small in-vitro study was done to compare cleaning methods.

====Cleaning study====
A single small in-vitro study (using human blood, but incubation outside the body) compared four cleaning treatments:
# cold water (cup rubbed with fingers under running water for 30 seconds)
# cold water and liquid soap (used instead of the more common bar soap so that the quantity could be more easily measured)
# cold water followed by steeping (putting the cup in a ceramic mug and pouring water over it as soon as the water boiled, then steeping for 5 min with the mug covered by a small plate; after five minutes, the water in the mug was still above 75 Celsius)
# cold water and soap followed by steeping
It did not compare boiling to steeping, or steeping after warming the mug. All of the methods decreased the bacterial load of the cups, with steeping having a bigger individual effect than soap; when using all three cleaning methods on cups (the fourth treatment), the authors were unable to culture bacteria from them. Just rinsing and steeping, with no soap, had very similar or identical effects.

The authors recommended using as many of the cleaning methods as possible, but using soap only if it can be thoroughly washed off, as soap residue can irritate the vagina. They pointed out the need for &quot;in-vivo&quot; studies, looking at real health outcomes, and the need for studies on more than the single model of cup they tested.

====Review of manufacturers&#x27; recommendations====
A 2022 review stated that &quot;Publicly accessible evidence is needed to create consumer confidence in the recommended cleaning practices... nearly all menstrual cup manufacturers fail to provide any publicly available independent evidence that supports their recommended cleaning practices&quot;. The review found no standards or guidelines for menstrual cup cleaning practices, and urged independent research to establish a normative standard.
The most common recommendations are:
*boiling a new cup before using it for the first time, for about five minutes
*when a menstrual cup is removed and emptied, it is generally cleaned before it is reinserted; the most common recommendations were:
**washing with water and a &quot;mild&quot; soap, for preference
**rinsing in water (second choice)
**wiping with a clean, dry wipe such as toilet tissue (third choice)
*boiling or steeping a cup between menstrual cycles for about five minutes.
Most manufacturers recommended using water and soap if readily available. Many counterrecommend scented soaps and soaps made with an excess of oil or fat (in order to create moisturizing soap). Scents and moisturizers are designed to remain as residues on the hands after washing.

Some manufacturers sell and recommend proprietary cleaning products. These are not considered necessary.

====Containers for steeping and boiling====
A dedicated menstrual-cup-cleaning pot may be too expensive, and use of kitchen pots socially unacceptable. Alternatives like used paint cans may contain harmful substances. Food cans are used; these hold their temperature better than an unwarmed ceramic mug for steeping, but there is no data on the safety of tinned or plastic-coated food cans for this use. Mason jars made for home canning are heatproof and designed to be sterilized by boiling; they have been used to steep-sterilize menstrual cups. They have also been used (presumably unsealed) for storage. Mugs have also been used. USB-powered sterilizers and proprietary menstrual cup cleaning solutions are not accessible to poorer users.

Some menstrual cups come with cleaning containers; the cup is intended to be steeped in the container with boiling water for five minutes or microwaved in the container with water for 3–5 minutes. Containers are made from a medical-grade silicone or polypropylene.

====In practice====
A South African study found that 93% used tap water when cleaning their cups at home, but only 32-44% rinsed their cups with tap water outside the home; when water was not available, many women left their cups in all day.

In situations where clean water is hard to get or in short supply, it may be difficult to clean the cup with water. Reusable alternatives, like washing rags, may take more water. A lack of soap also presents a problem in some developing countries.

Washing a menstrual cup in a sink at a public toilet can pose problems, as the handwashing sinks are often in a public space rather than in the toilet cubicle. Accessible loos generally have sinks that can be reached from the toilet, but they may be needed by people with limited mobility. Some users do not empty cups in public toilets; if they only empty the cup twice a day, every 12 hours, they can wait until they return home.

Boiling menstrual cups once a month can also be a problem in developing countries, if there is a lack of water, firewood or other fuel.

===Stain removal===

Smooth-surfaced cups are easier to clean; moulded text, ridges, bumps, and holes make it a bit more difficult. Some suggest scrubbing out grooves with a toothbrush, rag, or cloth, and airholes with an interdental brush.

Stains on any color of the cup can be removed or at least lightened by soaking the cup in diluted hydrogen peroxide, or leaving it out in the sun for a few hours. Some cup makers recommend against the use of hydrogen peroxide.

Some menstrual cups are sold colorless and translucent, but several brands also offer colored cups. Translucent cups lose their initial appearance faster than colored – they tend to get yellowish stains with use. It can be harder to see whether a dark-coloured cup is clean. The shade of a colored cup may change over time, though stains are often not as obvious on colored cups.

===Storage===

Manufacturers typically suggest letting the cup dry out fully and storing it dry in a breathable container, such as the cloth bag usually provided with the cup. Airtight wraps and containers are counterrecommended, especially if the cup is at all damp.

==Safety==
Menstrual cups are a safe option for managing menstruation, with risks comparable to or lower than alternatives (with the possible exception of the risk of intrauterine device (IUD) displacement). They are safe in in low-, middle-, and high-income settings.

Using a menstrual cup does not harm the vaginal flora. Studies looked at disruptions of the vaginal flora including excessive growth of yeast, excessive growth of harmful bacteria, excessive growth of Staphylococcus aureus, and other microorganisms; subjects using menstrual cups were not more likely to have these common vaginal problems than subjects using other methods, (cloth or disposable pads, or tampons); in some studies, they were less likely.

Menstrual cups can be used with an IUD, but it isn&#x27;t clear whether using a menstrual cup increases the risk of IUD expulsion, . About 6% of all IUD users have an IUD come out unintentionally, most commonly during menstruation. In three studies of expulsion rates in menstrual cup users, the rates were 3.7%, 17.3% and 18.6%. Menstrual cup users differ demographically from the general population of IUD users (for instance, they tend to be younger, and youth independently increases the risk of losing an IUD unintentionally). It has been suggested that when removing a menstrual cup, the user might accidentally pull on the IUD string, or that the suction might pull the IUD out. There is no data on what removal techniques, brands or types of cup might be riskier. Some IUD users have had the strings of their IUD cut quite short as a precaution against accidentally pulling it out while removing a cup. So far there is no data on IUD displacement in people using ring-shaped cups, which do not suction to the cervix in the way bell-shaped cups can.

===Rare issues===
The number of menstrual cup users is unknown. This makes it hard to estimate the rate of rarer health problems related to cups. There are few reports, and rare problems are unlikely to turn up in a randomized study.

Serious difficulty removing the cup, requiring professional assistance, is rare but not unknown. A 2019 review found two cases with bell-shaped silicone cups, and one case with an elaborate older model of diaphragm-like cup called a Gynaeseal. There were also 46 reports with a single brand of disposable ring-shaped plastic cup (of about 100 million cups sold); most were reported to the manufacturer.

A 2019 review found three cases in which a malpositioned menstrual cup pressed on a ureter, which blocked the flow of urine from a kidney to the bladder; this caused renal colic (acute pain on the flank and lower back) which went away once the cup was removed. It also found one case of urinary incontinence while using the cup, which cleared up when the cup was removed, and five other urinary complaints.

Most menstrual cups are made of silicone, and silicone allergies are rare. In 2010, there was one report to the FDA of someone with a silicone allergy who had to have reconstructive surgery to the vagina after using a silicone menstrual cup. There were two reports to the FDA of allergic reactions to a disposable plastic cup. A 2017 study in Dharpur, Gujarat, using a silicone cup described as ring-shaped and depicted as bell-shaped, collected two reports of rashes and one report of an allergy.

The 2019 review also found two reports of irritation to the vagina and cervix, neither of which had clinical consequences, and two of severe pain (one on removing a cup for the first time). There were three reports of a vaginal wound from menstrual cup use, but reviewers were not able to review any associated medical records.

One case report noted the development of endometriosis and adenomyosis in one menstrual cup user. Endometriosis affects 10–15% of menstruators. An online survey on the topic, with nine respondents, found three people who had used a menstrual cup and developed endometriosis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration made a public statement that there was insufficient evidence of risk.

===Toxic shock syndrome===
Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a potentially fatal bacterial illness. A 2019 review found the risk of toxic shock syndrome with menstrual cup use to be low, with five cases identified via their literature search (one with an IUD, one with an immunodeficiency). Data from the United States showed rates of TSS to be lower in people using menstrual cups versus high-absorbency tampons. Infection risk is similar or less with menstrual cups compared to pads or tampons.

There is an association between TSS and tampon use, although the exact connection remains unclear. TSS associated with menstrual cup use appears to be very rare, probably because menstrual cups are not absorbent, do not irritate the vaginal mucosal tissue, and so do not measurably change the vaginal flora.

The risk of TSS associated with contraceptive cervical caps and contraceptive diaphragms is also very low. Like menstrual cups, these products both use mostly medical grade silicone or latex.

A widely reported study showed that &quot;in vitro&quot;, bacteria associated with toxic shock syndrome (TSS) are capable of growing on menstrual cups, but results from similar studies are conflicting, and results from in-vivo studies do not show cause for concern.

==Size, shape, and flexibility==
There are no standards for the measurement or size-labelling of menstrual cups, and each manufacturer uses their own system. Self-measurement of the vagina and third-party measurement tables are often used to get a good fit.

Capacity affects how often the cup must be emptied. Some prefer to empty the cup only twice a day, morning and evening, to avoid emptying it in public toilets. Flow rates vary. On average, about 30mL of menstrual fluid is lost per month; 10 to 35mL is normal. Menstrual blood loss of more than 80mL per month is considered heavy menstrual bleeding, and grounds for consulting a doctor.

The stated capacity of menstrual cup is generally measured &quot;ex vivo&quot; (outside the body). It is the volume of fluid that will fill the cup to just below the airholes, if there are airholes, or just below the rim, if there are none. These volume measurements are generally overestimates of real life capacity, because the cup may be compressed inside the body, and the cervix will often occupy some of the volume of the cup. &quot;Ex-vivo&quot; capacities for menstrual cups are in the range of tens of milliliters; for comparison, a normal-size tampon or pad holds about 5mL when thoroughly soaked.

Smooth cups with no sharp edges are recommended by the UN. Moulded text, ridges, bumps, and holes make a cup harder to clean.

===Bell-shaped cups===

Bell-shaped menstrual cups all have a wall thickness of about 2mm. They vary in length, capacity, firmness, and external diameter of the rim. This accommodates variety in anatomy, flow quantity, and personal preferences for firmness.

While vaginal tenting causes the cervix to retract during sexual arousal, it is normally located within centimeters of the vaginal opening; 45-55mmm is a medium height. Cups are available in lengths from about 30-80mm, with 40-60mm lengths being common; most menstrual discs are shallower than most bell-shaped cups. Some manufacturers sell several sizes of cup that are all the same length.

Cups must be short enough that the cervix does not push the cup into contact with the vulva, where it may be uncomfortable. If the cervix sits particularly low or is tilted, a shorter cup may needed. A cup which is too short may sit too far up to remove easily.

Many bell-shaped cups have stems. The stems can be trimmed to shorten the cup, giving stemmed cups a minimum and maximum length; instructions for trimming are generally included with the cup. Some cups are made in two parts, with a separate stem passing through a hole in the cup; these separate stems, unlike normal one-piece stems, can be pulled to break the seal, and were designed to make removing the cup with low dexterity easier. There also exist cups with valves in the stem, which can be slowly drained without removing the cup. The UN counterrecommends hollow stems, because solid stems are easier to clean.

&quot;Ex vivo&quot;, small size cups hold about 15-25 ml, medium size cups 20-30 ml, and large cups 30-40 ml. The maximum capacity for large cups is about 50mL (ring-shaped cups generally hold a bit more than bell-shaped cups). Excessively high-volume cups can be uncomfortably large, so fit is prioritized.

Bell-shaped cups also vary by firmness or flexibility. Some manufacturers make the same cups in a range of firmness levels. A firmer cup pops open more easily after insertion and may hold a more consistent seal against the vaginal wall (preventing leaks), but some people find softer cups more comfortable to insert. The outside diameter of the rim will also affect seal and comfort.

====Sizing====
Cervix height is measured by touching the cervix with a fingertip, and using the thumb against the finger to mark the inner edge of the vaginal opening; the distance from the thumbnail to the tip of the finger is the height of the cervix. Cervix height varies slightly over the month, and is usually lowest on the first day of bleeding; minimum height is used for sizing menstrual cups. The cup length is generally taken to be equivalent to the cervix height, but as the cup rim will generally sit in the fornix, some may comfortably take a cup slightly longer than their cervical height. Fornix depth varies, but is usually between 1–5 cm (0.5-2 inches).

Manufacturers do not generally print cup dimensions on the box, but there are third-party tables of dimensions online. This forcers buyers to guess whether a cup will fit. A regulatory requirement for quantitative measurements, including a Young&#x27;s modulus measurement of firmness, has been suggested. Research into what measurements would be most useful for selecting a well-sized cup is also needed.

Most brands sell a smaller and a larger size, but some sell up to five sizes, and differing firmnesses. Sizes are mostly labelled transparently, (e.g. &quot;S&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, and &quot;L&quot;), but some manufacturers label sizes with ordinal numbers (e.g. &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, and &quot;2&quot;), alphabetic letters (e.g. &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;), or euphemisms (such as &quot;Petite&quot;, &quot;Regular&quot;, and &quot;Full fit&quot;). Between one manufacturer&#x27;s products, volume &quot;usually&quot; increases with number and position in the alphabet. Mostly, each larger size is slightly larger in all dimensions, but some manufacturers have sizes that differ in only one dimension (length, diameter, or capacity).

These sizes are not consistent between manufacturers. Manufacturers typically recommend the smaller size for under-30s who have not given birth vaginally and have a lighter flow, and the larger for everyone else. However, there is no medical evidence for sizing based on age or parity.

=== Ring-shaped cups or discs ===
Ring-shaped cups (also called menstrual discs or rings) are often approximately hemispherical in shape, like a diaphragm, with a flexible ring rim and a soft, collapsible center. They collect menstrual fluid like menstrual cups, but sit in the vaginal fornix and stay in place by hooking behind the pubic bone. Menstrual discs come in both disposable and reusable varieties.

Ring-shaped cups are sized differently than bell-shaped cups. Fit is much less individual; the flexible bowl makes depth unimportant, and any ring-shaped cup between 60-70mm diameter will fit most people adequately. Sizing is measured in the same way as it is for contraceptive diaphragms, which fit in the same position.

A study of circular-rim diaphragms failed to find any proxy factor (like parity or weight) which would allow prediction of the size of diaphragm someone needed; it was necessary to take a measurement. As with contraceptive diaphragms, some &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; cups have slightly oval or pear-shaped rims, and some have rims that arch (as seen from the side), increasing the range of sizes that fit. A contraceptive diaphragm using these techniques was found to fit 98% of volunteers in a multicenter study (everyone with a size of 65-80mm). A disc which is too big or too small will leak.

Ring-shaped cups come in diameters from 53mm to 80mm, . They have some advantages over bell-shaped cups, including that they have a higher &quot;ex-vivo&quot; capacity (40-80ml), enable bloodless period sex, and are more comfortable for some users. Disadvantages include messier removal and more difficulty learning to insert them than for bell-shaped cups.

Some ring-shaped cups have removal aids. These may be stringlike stems, notches (dents in the outside of the bowl), and pull loops (like the ring-pull tab of a drinks can, or like a strap running parallel to the rim), and some have hybrid looped notches (with a strap across the rim of the notch). Notched or looped disks may rotate in the body so that the grip is out of reach, so some cups have three notches/loops spaced around the circumference of the cup. Notches reduce cup volume. Removal aids like pull loops make ring-shaped cups easier to remove without spilling, but they may chafe, and can be harder to clean.

Some menstrual rings have ribbed membranes. It is difficult to mould thin membranes; the silicone or plastic has to flow into a very narrow part of the mould, and solidify only once it has filled the area. While it is possible to mould silicone membranes as thin as a quarter of a millimeter thick (), it requires care. Adding ribs (linear thicker areas) to the membrane makes it easier to mould. It also stiffens the membrane. Stiffer membranes may be more noticeable during sex, and smoother, softer ones less noticeable. It is anecdotally claimed that the increase in surface area from the ridges allows ridged cups to hold more blood; and that they may reduce effective natural vaginal lubrication when worn during sex. Texture may also be added to the outside of the membrane for grip, although it is usually the rim that is gripped when removing the cup.

Rings with a slimmer rim can be easier to slide around the cervix. A thin spot in the rim can let the rim fold more tightly for insertion and removal. Some ring-shaped cups also have concentric grooves on the outside of the rim; these can be harder to clean than an ungrooved rim. Grooves add stiffness while using less material; see I-beam.

Firmer ring-shaped cups can be easier to get into place, as they are stiffer, but softer rings fold more easily and tightly, and may be more comfortable to insert and remove. Firmer disks are therefore often preferred by new users. Unlike in bell-shaped cups, firmness does not affect the seal of a properly-fitting ring-shaped cup.

As more women seek comfort and sustainability in period care, menstrual discs are rapidly emerging as a popular choice. According to a study published in &quot;BMC Women&#x27;s Health&quot;, 37% of participants reported using reusable menstrual products during their last period, signalling a strong shift towards eco-friendly alternatives. Among these, menstrual discs stand out for their comfort, adaptability, and leak-proof protection. 

==== Sizing ====
Size can be measured in the same way as for contraceptive diaphragms; the fore and middle fingers are inserted until the tip of the middle finger is in the posterior fornix (the hollow on the spinewards side of the cervix), and the thumb is used against the forefinger to mark where the bony pubic arch touches the index finger. The diagonal distance between the tip of the middle finger and the thumbnail is then measured. This is the diameter of circular rim needed. At this depth the side walls of the vagina are quite stretchy, so no side-to-side measurement is needed.

Sizing rings can also be used. Disposable menstrual discs are also similar in size to many reusable ones, and can be used to check if an ~70mm diameter fits.

Many brands have a one-size-fits-most approach. Some sell two or three sizes, based on qualitative cervix height (low or high) rather than age or previous births. While North American manufacturers do not generally give dimensions, third-party tables of disc diameters are available online. European manufacturers generally do give the metric dimensions of their products online.

For circular rims, the outside rim diameter should match the diaphragm size. For oval and slightly egg-shaped rims, the sizing should be similar, but taking an average of the two rim dimensions. For complex three-dimensional rims, the manufacturer should indicate the size range the cup will fit.

==Materials and color==
Cups are made from rubbers (elastomers). Most are made from silicone rubber; some are made from latex or thermoplastic rubber. Some contain other ingredients, such as colourants or cheap bulking fillers. Cups made from good-quality materials last longer.

A UN specification says that cups must be made of medical-grade silicone. There are multiple medical grades. Plastics can also be medical-grade. Some jurisdictions require the use of medical-grade materials, but others do not. Where permitted, cups may be made of cheaper food-grade materials. The same make and model of cup may be made of different materials in different legal jurisdictions.

In many jurisdictions, menstrual products need not list ingredients. Some places, including some US states, have enacted laws requiring food-style ingredient lists, with the percentage of each ingredient. These laws include menstrual cups, and have been supported by some cup manufacturers.

===Base materials===
==== Latex ====

Early cups were made from latex manufactured from plant sap (usually gutta-percha or indiarubber). Latex is biodegradable. Latex allergy is common; around 4% of the general population worldwide has it, and repeated exposure makes a person more likely to develop it. Biologically-sourced latex may be brown or amber-coloured (see natural rubber).

Latex can harden over time.

==== Silicone rubber ====
Most brands use a silicone rubber (also called a silicone elastomer) as the material for their menstrual cups. Silicone is durable and hypoallergenic. Menstrual cups made from silicone are reusable for up to 10 years. The majority of menstrual cups on the market are reusable, rather than disposable.

Most brands, and all reputable ones, state that they use a medical-grade silicone. A UN specification requires medical-grade silicone. In most regulation systems, there are multiple subgrades of medical-grade silicones. For instance, in the US, class V and class VI are medical grades. Class VI is subgrouped into non-implantable (or medical-healthcare grade), shortterm-implantable, and longterm-implantable (with 30 days or more being long-term). Menstrual cups are commonly made of non-implantable medical-grade silicone. There are not specific grades of silicone rubber for long-term mucous membrane contact.

There are also non-regulatory distinctions. Most cups are made from liquid silicone rubber (LSR), but some seem to be made from high-consistency rubber (HCR). While LSR is indeed liquid, HCR is a putty-like material, which makes for differences in the manufacturing process. The former generally uses platinum catalysts to initiate curing (setting); the latter mostly uses peroxide catalysts.

While silicone rubbers, as polymers, are inert and hypoallergenic, the corresponding monomers are not. Silicone menstrual cups must therefore be fully cured before use. Heat accelerates curing.

Silicone rubbers also come in a range of Shore A hardnesses; a Shore hardness of 10 is gumlike, softer than some sponges and foams (chewing gum is about 20), while 80 is harder than the heel of a shoe. The firmness of a cup will be affected by the firmness of the material, but also its shape and dimensions.

==== Plastic ====
Plastics are also used for menstrual cups. The plastics used are generally thermoplastics (plastics that soften when heated, and can therefore be heat-moulded). They are also generally rubbery or elastomeric. The thermoplastic elastomers used in plastic cups are often unspecified, but are often of some medical grade.

The same brand and model of product may be made with different grades of plastic in different jurisdictions, with medical-grade plastic in jurisdictions that require it, and food-grade plastic in those that don&#x27;t. This may be reflected in the price.
===Colourants and other additives===

The silicone or thermoplastics which most brands of cups are produced are naturally colorless and translucent. Several brands offer colored cups as well as, or instead of the colorless ones. A UN specification says that cups must be made of medical-grade silicone, and may include additives like &quot;elastomer, dye or colorant&quot;, but no more than 0.5%. It also requires that the additives are non-toxic, non-carcinogenic, non-mutagenic, and do not cause skin irritation or skin sensitization.

Manufacturers generally do not specify what colourants they use, even on request.

In jurisdictions where cups are classed as medical devices, the colourants generally also have to be medical-grade, and fuse permanently to the raw material so that they cannot leach out. In jurisdictions where menstrual cups are classed as consumer devices, colourants need not be medical-grade. Some manufacturers use colourants certified for use in plastics intended to come in contact with food, for use in toys, and for use in consumer electronics. In some cases, a broader range of colours are available in jurisdictions where menstrual cups are not classed medical devices, and food-grade dyes can be used. The same brand and model of product may be made with different grades of colourant in different jurisdictions.

Because silicone rubbers are relatively expensive, some dodgier manufacturers mix cheaper fillers into their silicone. These fillers are typically not tested for safety. Such cups may or may not whiten when stretched only a small amount.

==Manufacturing==
Material must be treated carefully during manufacture to avoid contaminating it. ISO certification is used for silicone manufacturing processes, and is required for regulatory approval in some jurisdictions, like Canada.

Injection molding of liquid silicone rubber is used to make most cups. The setup costs (moulds etc.) are significant, so new designs are generally made in runs of about 4000 or more; production runs of existing designs are generally of about 500 or more at a time.

Larger production runs make for cheaper cups, because there are fixed set-up costs (it takes money to design a cup, set up a production run, and to clean up afterwards). Experience curve effects also reduce costs as more cups are made, including for repeated production runs of the same or similar cups. For example, for an extremely complex overmoulding of silicone on a shaped nylon spring, used for a contraceptive diaphragm, costs on a production run of 500 in 2010 were $20 US per item, while by 2013, batches of 10,000 and improvements in the manufacturing process had brought the cost down to $5 per item. By 2016, further improvements in manufacturing techniques had reduced the reject rate, making the product cheaper. See costs section, below, for non-manufacturing costs.

Good manufacturing will not show flash or conspicuous mould lines. Gate marks from the sprues of the mould may also be visible on some cups.

==Regulation==
Regulation varies by jurisdiction. Some international standards are used in multiple jurisdictions, especially those from the International Standards Association. Menstrual cup manufacturers seek and advertise ISO 13485 certification. ISO 13485 (quality management for the design and manufacturing of medical devices) and ISO 10993 (biocompatibility of medical devices) are both used for menstrual cups. ISO 14024 is an ecolabel which may be used by any manufacturer achieving certification to that standard; it is also used for some menstrual cups. While ISO standards are none-binding, specific ISO certifications may be legally required by some jurisdictions.

Many manufacturers comply with regulations in multiple jurisdictions. They may vary their products in order to do so, using cheaper materials and methods in jurisdictions where they are allowed.

===Australia===
Australia changed its regulatory environment in 2018, exempting menstrual cups from an obligation to register on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). Australia requires certain package labelling.

===Canada===
Canada regulates menstrual cups (like tampons and other insertables) as Class II medical devices. In Canada this means that they must be licensed by Health Canada before being advertised, imported, or sold. There are standards for materials and manufacturing facilities; getting accreditation and meeting the requirements can take years. There is also separate strong regulation of sustainability claims. This regulation raises costs for Canadian manufacturers; large manufacturers have made statements approving of the regulatory environment, though they complain about online competition from laxer jurisdictions.

Menstrual cups that meet the regulatory requirements to be sold in the United States may not be able to meet the requirements in Canada. This means that some menstrual cups manufactured in Canada are sold in the United States, but not in Canada.

===EU===
The EU does not regulate menstrual cups as medical devices, but categorizes them as &quot;general products&quot;, under the General Product Safety Directive (now replaced by the General Product Safety Regulation). This means that manufacturers, by selling them, guarantee that they are safe, but do not face more oversight than manufacturers of other consumer products.

Some menstrual cups carry the EU Ecolabel, which requires minimum standards for packaging, pollution, emission reduction, and toxic substances in the finished product.

The EU has the power to order the removal of unsafe products, including from online shops. Manufacturers inside and outside the EU may voluntarily use the CE mark on packaging to assert that a product meets EU regulations.

Some EU manufacturers voluntarily got ISO certifications.

===South Korea===
Menstrual cups are categorized as &quot;quasi-drugs&quot; in South Korea. On the 7th of December 2017, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety approved the first menstrual cup for sale in South Korea, after a process involving the submission of data from a three-cycle clinical trial on effectiveness, and screening for ten highly hazardous volatile organic compounds.

===US===
The US regulates menstrual cups as Class II medical devices, but this does not mean the same thing as in Canada. The manufacturers of the silicone, the manufacturer that shapes it into cups, and the vendor, must all be registered with the FDA (using a 510(k) premarket notification and clearance) for a product to be sold legally in the United States. They must submit the required paperwork detailing their manufacturing process and similarity to existing products, and provide contact information. The US regulates the end products, but not the materials. Menstrual cups, unlike tampons, do not require premarket review.

Some cups claim to be &quot;FDA approved&quot;. The Food and Drug administration does not approve Class II medical devices, only Class III medical devices. Menstrual cups are categorized as class II, not class III, so they cannot be &quot;approved&quot;, only &quot;cleared&quot;, and these claims are inaccurate.

The FDA requires certain product labelling on (or in) all packaging.

==Cost==
The costs for menstrual cups vary widely, from US$0.70 to $47 per cup, with a median cost of $23.35 (based on a 2019 review of 199 brands of menstrual cups available in 99 countries). Regulatory environment can have a strong effect on the price, because compliance may be time-consuming and costly. For manufacturing costs, see manufacturing section, above.

Reusable menstrual products (including reusable menstrual cups) are more economical than disposable pads or tampons. The same 2019 review looked at costs across seven countries and found that, over 10 years, a menstrual cup costs $460.25 less than 12 disposable pads per period and $304.25 less than 12 tampons per period.

Despite the long-term cost savings, the upfront cost of a menstrual cup is a barrier for some.

==Environmental impact==

Since they are reusable, menstrual cups help to reduce solid waste. Some disposable menstrual pads and plastic tampon applicators can take 25 years to break down in the ocean and can cause a significant environmental impact. Biodegradable sanitary options are also available, and these decompose in a short period of time, but they must be composted, and not disposed of in a landfill.

When considering a 10-year time period, waste from consistent use of a menstrual cup is only a small fraction of the waste of pads or tampons. For example, if compared with using 12 pads per period, use of a menstrual cup would produce only 0.4% of the plastic waste.

Each year, an estimated 20 billion pads and tampons are discarded in North America. They typically end up in landfills or are incinerated, which can have a great impact on the environment. Most of the pads and tampons are made of cotton and plastic. Plastic takes about 50 or more years and cotton starts degrading after 90 days if it is composted.

Given that the menstrual cup is reusable, its use greatly decreases the amount of waste generated from menstrual cycles, as there is no daily waste and the amount of discarded packaging decreases as well. After their life span is over, silicone cups can be burned or sent to a landfill. Alternatively, one brand offers a recycling program and some hospitals are able to recycle medical grade silicone, including cups. Cups made from TPE can be recycled in areas that accept #7 plastics. Rubber cups are compostable.

Menstrual cups may be emptied into a small hole in the soil or in compost piles, since menstrual fluid is a valuable fertilizer for plants and any pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases will quickly be destroyed by soil microbes. The water used to rinse the cups can be disposed of in the same way. This reduces the amount of wastewater that needs to be treated.

In developing countries, solid waste management is often lacking. Here, menstrual cups have an advantage over disposable pads or tampons as they do not contribute to the solid waste issues in the communities or generate embarrassing refuse that others may see.

== History ==
Menstrual cups may have been inspired by other types of vaginal inserts used throughout history. Vaginal inserts had various purposes from birth control, enabling abortions, to supporting a prolapsed uterus. The first version of what we would now call a menstrual cup was a rubber sack attached to a rubber ring created by S.L. Hockert in 1867, which was patented in the United States. An early version of a bullet-shaped menstrual cup was patented in 1932, by the midwifery group of McGlasson and Perkins. Leona Chalmers patented the first usable commercial cup in 1937. Other menstrual cups were patented in 1935, 1937, and 1950. The Tassaway brand of menstrual cups was introduced in the 1960s, but it was not a commercial success. Early menstrual cups were made of rubber. The first menstrual-cup applicator was mentioned in a 1968 Tassaway patent; there are also 21st-century versions, but they have not been a commercial success, .

No medical research was conducted to ensure that menstrual cups were safe prior to introduction on the market. Early research in 1962 evaluated 50 volunteers using a bell-shaped cup. The researchers obtained vaginal smears, gram stains, and basic aerobic cultures of vaginal secretions. Vaginal speculum examination was performed, and pH was measured. No significant changes were noted. This report was the first containing extensive information on the safety and acceptability of a widely used menstrual cup that included both preclinical and clinical testing and over 10 years of post-marketing surveillance.

In 1987, another latex rubber menstrual cup, The Keeper, was manufactured in the United States. This proved to be the first commercially viable menstrual cup and it is still available today. The first silicone menstrual cup was the UK-manufactured Mooncup in 2001. Most menstrual cups are now manufactured from medical grade silicone properties.

An early menstrual disc, the Gynaeseal, was developed by Dr John Cattanach in 1989, but never found commercial success. In 1997, the Instead Feminine Protection Cup began to be sold across the United States. Designed by Audrey Contente, the disposable disc was made of Kraton. In 2018, reusable silicone discs were introduced. As of 2021, there were ten brands of discs available for purchase in various markets.

Menstrual cups are becoming more popular worldwide, with many different brands, shapes, and sizes on the market. Most are reusable, though there is at least one brand of disposable menstrual cups currently manufactured.

Some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and companies have begun to propose menstrual cups to women in developing countries since about 2010, for example in Kenya and South Africa. Menstrual cups are regarded as a low-cost and environmentally friendly alternative to sanitary cloth, expensive disposable pads, or &quot;nothing&quot; – the reality for many women in developing countries.

=== Acceptability studies ===

In a randomized controlled feasibility study in rural western Kenya, adolescent primary school girls were provided with menstrual cups or menstrual pads instead of traditional menstrual care items of cloth or tissue. Girls provided with menstrual cups had a lower prevalence of sexually transmitted infections than control groups. Also, the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis was lower among cup users compared with menstrual pad users or those continuing other usual practice.

==Society and culture==
===Public funding for menstrual cups===

The municipality of Alappuzha in Kerala, India launched a project in 2019 and gave away 5,000 menstrual cups for free to residents. The purpose of this was to encourage the use of these cups instead of non-biodegradable menstrual pads to reduce waste production.

In 2022, Kumbalangi, a village in Kerala, became India&#x27;s first sanitary-napkin-free panchayat under a project called &quot;Avalkkayi&quot;, which gave away 5,700 menstrual cups for free.

In 2022, the Spanish government began distributing free menstrual cups through public institutions (such as schools, prisons, and health facilities).

In March 2024, Catalonia, in Spain, started supplying free menstrual cups as part of the &quot;My period, my rules&quot; initiative. The universal public healthcare system supplied one menstrual cup, one pair of period underwear, and two packages of reusable cloth menstrual pads per person, available through local pharmacies. The program covers 2.5 million people and cost the Catalan government €8.5 million (3.40 euros / US dollars per person). The program was undertaken for equity, poverty reduction, taboo reduction, and environmental benefits. It is expected to reduce waste from single-use menstrual hygiene products, which had been 9000 tons per year, according to the Catalan government.

=== Developing countries ===
Menstrual cups can be useful as a means of menstrual hygiene management for people in developing countries where access to affordable sanitary products may be limited. A lack of affordable hygiene products means inadequate, unhygienic alternatives are often used, which can present a serious health risk. Menstrual cups offer a long-term solution compared to some other menstrual hygiene products because they do not need to be replaced monthly.

=== Cultural aspects ===

Menstrual hygiene products that need to be inserted into the vagina can be unacceptable for cultural reasons. There are myths that they interfere with female reproductive organs and that they cause females to &quot;lose their virginity&quot;.

There is no evidence that tampon use commonly causes trauma to the hymen. Hymens vary, and septate, cribriform or microperforate hymens, rarer physiological variations, may interfere with tampon use. Some ring-shaped menstrual cups are no bulkier than a tampon when folded as recommended.

Inserting objects (including penises) into the vagina may or may not affect the hymen. Some cultures wrongly think that the state of the hymen can give evidence of virginity, and wrongly believe that inserting anything into the vagina will &quot;break&quot; the hymen. This can discourage youths from using cups.

Despite common cultural beliefs, the state of a hymen cannot be used to prove or disprove virginity. Penile penetration does not lead to predictable changes to female genital organs; after puberty, hymens are highly elastic and can stretch during penetration without trace of injury. Females with a confirmed history of sexual abuse involving genital penetration may have normal hymens. Young females who say they have had consensual sex mostly show no identifiable changes in the hymen. Hymens rarely completely cover the vagina, hymens naturally have irregularities in width, and hymens can heal spontaneously without scarring. Many women do not bleed on having vaginal sex for the first time, hymens may not bleed significantly when torn, and vaginal walls may bleed significantly when torn.

There has been one news report of the stem of a bell-shaped cup passing outwards through a small side hole in a septate hymen (a hymen with more than one opening), causing pain on attempted removal. The woman had the problem diagnosed and the cup removed at a hospital. She had previously used the cup without problems for four years. Some examine their hymen with a mirror before using a menstrual cup.

<text>Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (abbreviated as TNA Wrestling or TNA) is an American professional wrestling promotion based in Nashville, Tennessee. It is a subsidiary of Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment, a Canadian media company owned by businessman Leonard Asper.

Founded by Jeff Jarrett and Jerry Jarrett in 2002, following the end of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 2001, the promotion was initially known as NWA: Total Nonstop Action (NWA-TNA) and was affiliated with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) governing body. The promotion dropped the &quot;NWA&quot; brand from its name in 2004, becoming Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. TNA continued to use the NWA World Heavyweight and Tag Team championships until this agreement ended in 2007; after which, the company would create its own World Heavyweight and World Tag Team championships. The promotion was purchased by Anthem at the beginning of 2017. In March of that year, it was rebranded to Impact Wrestling after its weekly flagship television show, but returned to the TNA branding in January 2024.

From its inception, TNA had been considered the second-largest in the United States behind WWE a position it would hold for most of the 2000s and early 2010s. The promotion was known for featuring former top talent from WCW, WWE, and ECW, such as Raven, Jeff Jarrett, and Sting, free agents that were released from the WWE such as Kurt Angle, Jeff Hardy, and Mr. Kennedy (who wrestled as Mr. Anderson in TNA), as well as more homegrown wrestlers who had not appeared in WWE yet and mainly performed for the promotion such as AJ Styles and Samoa Joe. (Some of whom would later be signed by WWE during the mid to late 2010s as TNA suffered financial issues). From 2015 to 2017, the promotion was viewed by some to have fallen behind longtime rival Ring of Honor; with the loss of their U.S. television contract with Spike in 2014, as well as monetary and personnel issues, being noted as factors to their decline.

By 2019, the promotion was viewed to have recovered through its sustained international distribution, and the purchase by its parent company of AXS TV; which subsequently began carrying the promotion&#x27;s programming. TNA is currently viewed as being the third-largest wrestling promotion in the United States; following the establishment of All Elite Wrestling (AEW) in 2019, and its current television deals with Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s TNT and TBS (both of which are seen in more households than AXS).

== History ==
=== Formation and early history (2002–2004) ===

The concept of TNA originated shortly after World Championship Wrestling (WCW) ended in 2001, with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE) gaining a monopoly on the industry. While on a fishing trip, Bob Ryder, Jeff Jarrett and Jerry Jarrett contemplated their futures in the professional wrestling business under a parent company known as JSports &amp; Entertainment, LLC. Ryder suggested a company not reliant on television, but rather one going straight to pay-per-view. In July 2002, Vince Russo joined Jeff and Jerry Jarrett&#x27;s NWA-TNA promotion as a creative writer and would assist in the writing and production of the shows. Russo states that he coined the name &quot;Total Nonstop Action&quot;, the initials of the company &quot;TNA&quot; being a play on &quot;T&amp;A&quot;. The original intention, as they were exclusive to pay-per-view, was to be viewed as an edgier product than WWE.

Initially, TNA&#x27;s weekly pay-per-view show operated as the company&#x27;s main source of revenue, in place of monthly pay-per-view events used by other promotions. These shows took place mostly at the Tennessee State Fairground Sports Arena in Nashville, nicknamed the &quot;TNA Asylum&quot;. In October 2002, Panda Energy International purchased a controlling interest (72%) of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling from Jerry Jarrett. TNA (which originally traded as &quot;JSports and Entertainment&quot;) was re-organized as &quot;TNA Entertainment&quot;, LLC, in the process. Dixie Carter was appointed president of TNA Entertainment in spring 2003. &quot;Xplosion&quot; launched on November 27, 2002, as TNA&#x27;s first regular cable show and featured exclusive matches taped at the TNA Asylum as well as exclusive interviews with TNA wrestlers and the promotion&#x27;s original weekly pay-per-view shows took place mostly at the Tennessee State Fairground Sports Arena in Nashville, Tennessee. The last weekly pay-per-view took place on September 8, 2004, with a total of 111 weekly pay-per-views.

=== Growth and surging popularity (2004–2009) ===

In May 2004, TNA introduced its second weekly television program, &quot;Impact!&quot; (stylized as &quot;iMPACT!&quot;), produced at Soundstage 21, nicknamed the &quot;Impact Zone&quot;, at Universal Studios Florida and broadcast on Fox Sports Net (FSN). With the show&#x27;s première, TNA introduced a six-sided wrestling ring, the implementation of the &quot;Fox Box&quot; displaying competitors and timekeeping for the match and a generally more sports-like style than the sports entertainment style exemplified by WWE.

In June 2004, TNA issued a press release stating it had signed a master toy license agreement with Toy Biz, with various action figures and playsets releasing between 2005 and 2007.

TNA would subsequently discontinue producing weekly pay-per-views in favor of a traditional monthly pay-per-view schedule, beginning with Victory Road in November 2004. TNA&#x27;s television contract with Fox Sports expired in May 2005. Without television exposure, &quot;Impact!&quot; would continue to air through webcastsoriginally made available via BitTorrent and eventually via RealPlayerand replace &quot;Xplosion&quot;&#x27;s timeslot on Urban America Television.

On September 11, 2005, TNA held its Unbreakable pay-per-view. Unbreakable is remembered for the three-way match main event for the TNA X Division Championship, between AJ Styles, Christopher Daniels, and Samoa Joe, which received a rare 5Star match rating from wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer, the first one the company received.

Later that year, TNA would secure a television deal with Spike TV; &quot;Impact!&quot; debuted on the network on October 1, 2005. The episode saw Team 3D make their TNA debut. TNA would gain attention for the many high-profile talent that would join the promotion during the show&#x27;s run on Spike. From 2005 to 2009, these include Kevin Nash, Rhino, Christian Cage, Sting (who made appearances at previous &quot;Asylum&quot; shows), Scott Steiner, Kurt Angle, Booker T, and Mick Foley.

In April 2006, TNA launched a YouTube channel, featuring clips from &quot;Impact&quot; and exclusive content. Beginning with Bound for Glory in October 2006, TNA began holding select pay-per-view events outside of Orlando, Florida. In January 2007, TNA announced a deal with New Motion, Inc. which led to the introduction of TNA Mobile service. TNA has also launched &quot;TNA U TV&quot;; podcasts aired through YouTube to help promote the company.

In August 2007, live-events coordinator Craig Jenkins stated that TNA intended to stage eight pay-per-views and 96 house shows outside Orlando, Florida, in 2008.

From 2007 to 2008, TNA first toured Europe, hosting two shows at Porto and Lisbon in Portugal, with TNA later conducting its first tour of England, with most shows selling out which later broke TNA&#x27;s attendance records with the promotion later touring in Germany, Scotland and Ireland in 2009, France, Wales and the United Arab Emirates in 2010 and Belgium in 2012.

In February 2008, Jakks Pacific announced it had signed a multi-year master toy license agreement with TNA, to release products starting in 2010.

In March 2008, Tristar Productions acquired an exclusive license deal to produce and distribute TNA trading cards and memorabilia. On September 9, 2008, Midway Games released the &quot;TNA Impact&quot;! video game. On October 23, 2008, TNA began producing its programming in HD. In addition, a new HD set for &quot;Impact&quot; was introduced, including new lighting, and large high-resolution screens.

On June 21, 2009, TNA launched an online video-vault subscription-service where subscribers could watch past pay-per-views by choosing one of three payment options.

=== Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff leadership, and financial troubles (2010–2016) ===
In October 2009, TNA President Dixie Carter hired Hulk Hogan and former WCW President Eric Bischoff. Hulk Hogan first appeared on the January 4, 2010, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. Both obtained a position behind the scenes; with Bischoff part of creative and Hogan as a consultant. Under their tenure, TNA would see several revamps in 2010. Beginning with Genesis in January, TNA returned to using a four-sided ring. That month, Jakks Pacific announced a five-year agreement to produce TNA action figures. &quot;Impact!&quot; would also begin airing on Monday nights directly opposite of &quot;WWE Raw&quot;, marking the first time that two major professional wrestling promotions would go head to head since the launch of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; in 1995. The show would permanently move to Mondays on March 8, 2010, Spike would keep the Thursday night slot open for repeats of the Monday night shows. During this time, Ric Flair, Rob Van Dam, Mr. Anderson would make their debuts, while Jeff Hardy would make his return. &quot;Impact!&quot; would later return to Thursday nights on May 3.

On July 2, 2010, TNA hosted a live house show at MCU Park, which also broke the TNA domestic attendance record at the time and being the most attended live TNA house show in the United States, with a capacity crowd of 5,550.

During the May 3, 2011, &quot;Impact!&quot; television tapings, the show would change its name to &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;. On November 7, 2011, TNA revealed that Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) would become TNA&#x27;s official developmental territory. In December 2011, TNA debuted their new India-based subsidiary promotion Ring Ka King. On May 31, 2012, &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; began airing live at a new start time of 8 p.m. EST on Thursday nights. The live schedule would continue throughout 2012. In 2012, Panda Energy divested itself of its stake in TNA. Dixie Carter, the daughter of Panda Energy founder Robert Carter, who had been serving as TNA&#x27;s president, acquired that stake, making her TNA&#x27;s majority shareholder. In March 2013, TNA began taping Impact from different venues around the United States and terminated its lease with Universal Studios. On March 14, TNA introduced a new universal HD stage which would be used for all weekly programming. On November 2, TNA ended its relationship with OVW.

TNA formed a relationship with Japanese promotion Wrestle-1 beginning in July 2013 with a meeting between TNA founder Jeff Jarrett and Wrestle-1 head Keiji Mutoh. It was arranged for Jarrett to wrestle for W-1 in October 2013. In November, A.J. Styles successfully defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at a Wrestle-1 show in Japan.

From the period of 2013 to 2014, many well-known names or veterans of the company left TNA. In October 2013, Hulk Hogan&#x27;s contract with TNA expired, ending his time as creative consultant with the company. In December, AJ Styles left TNA after his contract expired. Styles later said that he could not accept TNA&#x27;s new contract offer, which would see him take a 60% cut in pay and TNA founder Jeff Jarrett would resign from the company, but remained as minority shareholder until his temporary return on June 24, 2015, with the deal for his return including the transfer of his minority stake to Dixie Carter, making her sole shareholder. The following year Jarrett revealed plans to start a new professional wrestling promotion, Global Force Wrestling. Further departures in 2014 included TNA veterans Sting, Chris Sabin, Hernandez, Christopher Daniels and Kazarian all leaving the company in that year, and the contracts of TNA Hall of Famers Bully Ray and Devon reportedly expired in October 2014, with TNA moving them to the alumni section of their roster in January 2015.

In late July, the &quot;TMZ&quot; website reported that Spike TV was not renewing &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; beyond October. TNA would refute the report, stating that negotiations were still ongoing. On August 14, &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; moved to Wednesday nights. On August 20, TNA signed an extension with Spike TV until the end of 2014.

In November 2014, TNA announced a new agreement with Discovery Communications to distribute its programming in the United States on Destination America and to selected international markets. Spike&#x27;s outreach at the time was estimated to be more than 97 million homes while Destination America was estimated to reach 59 million households. &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; ceased airing new televised events on Spike after the November 19 episode. The final episodes of 2014 were &quot;Best of TNA&quot; clip shows. On January 7, 2015, &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; moved to Destination America, with a live debut from The Manhattan Center&#x27;s Grand Ballroom in New York City.

In addition to &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, which was now airing on Friday nights, two new shows produced were &quot;Impact Wrestling: Unlocked&quot;, hosted by Mike Tenay, and &quot;TNA Wrestling&#x27;s Greatest Matches&quot;, a series presenting the best matches in the company&#x27;s history. From December 2014 to March 2015, several employees re-signed with TNA, including Kurt Angle, Jeff Hardy, Gail Kim, Mr. Anderson, Abyss and Matt Hardy. Awesome Kong also re-joined the company following several years of absence. During this period, veteran Samoa Joe and commentator Tazz left the company by mutual consent.

On April 27, 2015, Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan joined TNA as senior producer of creative and talent development. According to a report on August 7, TNA filed a new business name of Impact Ventures, LLC.

Destination America gained over 41.94 million viewers over the course of 2015&#x27;s first quarter, making this the channel&#x27;s best first quarter ever, followed by their best May ever in prime time. In both cases, Discovery Communications touted &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; as one of the reasons for the increase in viewers. Despite this success, Discovery Communications dropped &quot;Unlocked&quot; and &quot;Greatest Matches&quot; from their programming in May 2015.

On November 19, TNA signed a deal with Pop TV to air &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, where it premiered on Tuesday, January 5, 2016, in a live special held at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. With this move to Pop, &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; introduced a new HD set, graphics and theme music. This show saw the semi-finals and finals of the TNA World Title Series, which was won by Ethan Carter III. Husband and wife team Mike Bennett and Maria Kanellis would debut soon after. Subsequent shows would include episodes taped during a tour of England, which would be the last TNA appearances for Kurt Angle. TNA returned to taping &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; at the Impact Zone at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, beginning with a live Impact Wrestling on March 15. On March 19, longtime TNA wrestlers Eric Young and Bobby Roode left the promotion after 12 years. On April 22, Velvet Sky, another longtime TNA wrestler, left the company.
It was reported near the beginning of 2016 that Aroluxe Marketing, a Brentwood, Tennessee–based marketing agency, had taken a stake in TNA at the start of 2016 in return for providing partial funding, as well as taking over TNA&#x27;s production operations. It was reported in June 2016 that Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan acquired a minority stake in TNA from Dixie Carter, but he had instead provided a loan to Carter. Then on August 12, Billy Corgan became the promotion&#x27;s new president, while Carter transitioned from president to the company&#x27;s new chairwoman and chief strategy officer.

It was reported on September 16 by the &quot;New York Post&quot; that Canada&#x27;s Fight Network, through its parent company, Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment Corporation, had taken a stake in TNA. On October 13, Corgan sued TNA due to unpaid debt which Corgan claimed TNA had defaulted on. The State of Tennessee also put a lien on TNA for unpaid taxes. Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment, parent company of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;″s Canadian broadcaster, Fight Network, offered to help TNA and repay Corgan for the loans, while also offering additional financial assistance to TNA to help keep them from filing for bankruptcy. On October 31, Corgan lost his injunction that kept TNA from selling the company, but TNA was required to pay Corgan back by November 1. It was possible that one of the other minority owners could pay Corgan, effectively making them the majority owner of TNA.

On November 3, the company revealed that Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment provided a credit facility to fund operations for TNA and that Corgan was removed as the promotion&#x27;s president. However, Corgan himself stated that neither TNA nor Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment had yet repaid the $2.7million debt that was owed to him by TNA and, as such, he was considering suing, as well as converting the debt into a 36 percent stake. As the result of a settlement between Corgan and TNA, Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment acquired the loans Corgan made to Carter in the process.

=== Acquisition by Anthem and re-brandings (2017–2023) ===

Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment, a company owned by former Canwest CEO Leonard Asper, purchased a majority stake of TNA, re-organizing TNA&#x27;s parent company with Aroluxe having 10 percent while Carter retaining a five percent minority stake in the company, but resigned as chairwoman after 14 years with the company, while joining the advisory board of Fight Media Group. The promotion&#x27;s parent company, TNA Entertainment, was changed firstly to Impact Ventures and then to Anthem Wrestling Exhibitions, LLC., with Anthem&#x27;s Executive Vice President Ed Nordholm becoming President of the new parent company. Shortly after Anthem&#x27;s acquisition of TNA, it was re-branded to Impact Wrestling. On January 5, 2017 Jeff Jarrett was brought back by Anthem to serve as a consultant and later promoted to executive producer and chief creative officer. Anthem re-branded the promotion as Impact Wrestling, after its primary television series two months later. Wrestlers Drew Galloway, Matt Hardy, Jeff Hardy, Jade, Crazzy Steve, Mike Bennett and Maria Kanellis left the company during this period.

In April 2017, it was announced on &quot;Impact!&quot; that the promotion would &quot;merge&quot; with Jarrett&#x27;s newer Global Force Wrestling (GFW) promotion. In the lead-up to the Slammiversary XV PPV, Anthem officially announced its intent to acquire GFW to formalize the merger. The company subsequently announced that they were re-branding again and taking the GFW name in June; the re-branding was short-lived as they severed ties with Jarrett that October and the deal for Anthem to acquire GFW was never completed. During that time, Anthem launched the Global Wrestling Network, a new streaming service which featured content from to their tape library and other sources. Jarrett subsequently filed a lawsuit against Anthem in the District Court of Tennessee for copyright infringement over the GFW rights; the lawsuit was ultimately settled out of court.

Don Callis and Scott D&#x27;Amore became executive vice presidents in January 2018, taking charge of Impact Wrestling&#x27;s day-to-day operations. At the first tapings under their tenure, the company reverted to a traditional four-sided ring, and the show also saw the return of former World Heavyweight Champion Austin Aries, as well the debuts of new wrestlers such as Kiera Hogan, Su Yung, Pentagón Jr., Fénix and Brian Cage. The company also announced a partnership with live streaming service Twitch to produce content for their platform, starting with &quot;Brace for Impact&quot;, which was co-promoted with New Jersey–based promotion WrestlePro. Their first live show was &quot;Impact vs. Lucha Underground&quot;, a co-promoted show with Lucha Underground.

&quot;Impact!&quot; subsequently moved to Pursuit Channel beginning January 11, 2019. Two months later, the promotion announced that Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) would serve as its developmental territory once again. In May, Impact Plus replaced the Global Wrestling Network as the official streaming app for the promotion. &quot;Impact!&quot; began airing on Anthem-owned AXS TV after Bound for Glory in October.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Impact would hold events behind closed doors at Skyway Studios in Nashville. During the pandemic, the promotion cancelled its planned event, and Tessa Blanchard, who became the first woman to win the promotion&#x27;s World Championship earlier that year at Hard to Kill, was fired and stripped of the championship after a long absence. Slammiversary saw the returns of The Motor City Machine Guns, Eric Young, Doc Gallows and EC3, as well as the debuts of Karl Anderson and Heath Slater.

After the events of AEW Winter Is Coming on December 2, 2020, Impact began a partnership with All Elite Wrestling (AEW), which lasted until Bound for Glory 2021. AEW-contracted wrestlers Kenny Omega and Christian Cage held the Impact World Championship during this time; this marked Cage&#x27;s first in-ring return to the promotion since 2008. In February 2021, Impact launched &quot;Before the Impact&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;BTI&quot;), and &quot;Xplosion&quot; was canceled after 19 years the following month. During No Surrender Impact announced a new partnership with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). Don Callis&#x27; time as Impact executive vice president and on-air talent ended in May.

Slammiversary 2021 marked the return of in-person spectators for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. That month, &quot;BTI&quot; and &quot;Impact!&quot; would crossover for the first time, when Josh Alexander faced T. J. Perkins for the X Division Championship in Impact&#x27;s first-ever 60-minute Iron man match, which began on &quot;BTI&quot; and concluded in the opening minutes of &quot;Impact!&quot;. Impact subsequently announced the end of their partnership with Twitch that August and launched a new YouTube membership program called &quot;Impact Wrestling Insiders&quot;.

In November 2022, Impact and DAZN signed a partnership where the streaming service will distribute select non-live shows in most countries except the United States, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

On May 8, 2023, Impact announced their first ever Australian shows named Down Under Tour, a four-day tour with two marquee wrestling shows that took part on June 30 and July 1 in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales.

=== Return to TNA (since 2023)===
At the conclusion of Bound for Glory on October 21, 2023, Impact announced that it would revive the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) name. From October 26 to 28, Impact held events in Scotland and England, marking their first United Kingdom tour since 2015.

In December 2023, the promotion announced it had signed a new toy license with PowerTown, to release its first line of product in August 2024.

The name change to TNA took effect in January 2024, with the first event under the reinstated TNA banner being Hard To Kill. On February 7, Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment announced that Scott D&#x27;Amore&#x27;s contract with TNA was terminated, with D&#x27;Amore being removed from his position as President of TNA, later being replaced by Anthony Cicione.

In 2024, TNA began a wider talent exchange with WWE. Several TNA wrestlers would make appearances on NXT&#x27;s weekly television series and livestreaming events and vice versa. A multi-year partnership between TNA and WWE was officially announced on January 16, 2025.

On February 12, 2025, Cicione resigned from his position as President of TNA, and has been replaced by Carlos Silva.

== Television and touring schedule ==
=== Weekly pay-per-views (2002–2004) ===
From June 2002 until September 2004, the promotion&#x27;s original weekly pay-per-view shows took place mostly at the Tennessee State Fairground Sports Arena in Nashville, Tennessee, nicknamed the &quot;TNA Asylum&quot;. There were a total of 111 weekly pay-per-views.

=== &quot;Impact!&quot; and &quot;Xplosion&quot; in Universal Studios (2004–2013) ===

From June 2004 to March 2013, TNA programming was taped at Universal Studios Florida&#x27;s Soundstage 21 in Orlando, Florida. The Soundstages at Universal were dubbed the &quot;Impact Zone&quot; by the company. Pay-per-views were also broadcast from that location until October 2006, when Bound for Glory emanated from the Compuware Arena in Plymouth, Michigan.
Initially, TNA worked with Hermie Sadler&#x27;s United Wrestling Federation in 2005 to create house shows. TNA permitted the usage of the ring and for championships to be defended at these events. TNA started running independent house shows on March 17, 2006. They would continue to work with United Wrestling Federation and promote independent shows at the same time, until 2007. In 2007, TNA first toured Europe, hosting two shows at Porto and Lisbon in Portugal with APW Wrestling. In 2008, TNA wrestlers appeared at Wrestle Kingdom II in Japan. Later on in 2008, TNA conducted its first tour of England, with most shows selling out. The promotion first toured Germany, Scotland and Ireland in 2009, France, Wales and the United Arab Emirates in 2010 and Belgium in 2012.
In August 2007, live-events coordinator Craig Jenkins stated that TNA intended to stage eight pay-per-views and 96 house shows outside Orlando, Florida, in 2008.
In 2009, during their United Kingdom tour, a house show at Wembley Arena in London broke TNA&#x27;s attendance records. On July 2, 2010, MCU Park hosted a live TNA house show, which also broke the TNA domestic attendance record at the time and is currently the most attended live TNA house show in the United States, with a capacity crowd of 5,550.

=== Outside the Impact Zone (2013–2017) ===
On January 31, 2013, TNA announced that they would tape their programming in different venues around the United States, with the first live show being held on March 14, in the Sears Centre in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. Unable to cover the rising costs of taping on the road, TNA would return to Universal Studios on November 21, 2013. The promotion would continue to occasionally tape programming from other venues; such as the Sands Casino Event Center in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; the Manhattan Center&#x27;s Grand Ballroom in New York City; The SSE Hydro in Glasgow; Manchester Arena in Manchester; Wembley Arena in London, as part of a January 2015 tour.
In June 2017, the promotion, having been rebranded Impact Wrestling, held a show in India, becoming the first major U.S. promotion to hold events in that country. After Bound for Glory 2017 in November 2017, Impact would do a set of tapings in Ottawa.

=== Post-Universal Studios (2018–present) ===
Following the 2018 Redemption pay-per-view, Impact Wrestling would return to touring, taping in various smaller venues. The year&#x27;s taping locations included Windsor, Ontario, Toronto, Mexico City, New York City, and Las Vegas.
In 2019, Impact Wrestling held tapings in Philadelphia, Dallas, New York City, Houston, Windsor, Mexico City, Nashville, Toronto, Rahway, Fort Campbell, Owensboro, and other venues in Ontario.

====Effects of COVID-19====

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Impact Wrestling programming was taped and held behind closed doors at Skyway Studios in the promotion&#x27;s home base of Nashville, Tennessee from April 2020 through June 2021. Beginning with Slammiversary in July 2021, fans were allowed in attendance at Skyway. 
On October 23, 2021, Impact held their first event outside of Nashville in a year and a half with Bound for Glory, which took place just outside of Las Vegas in Sunrise Manor, Nevada.
After a brief Las Vegas area residency to end 2021, Impact resumed a full schedule of live touring in January 2022.
In March 2023, Impact held events in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. This would mark their first shows outside of the U.S. in three years. Numerous other shows were held throughout Canada all through the year.
Impact held its first ever shows in Australia on June 30 and July 1, 2023. From October 26 to 28, 2023, Impact held events in Scotland and England, marking their first United Kingdom tour since 2015.
On November 26, 2023, Impact and partner promotion Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA), co-promoted the Ultra Clash supershow in the Monterrey, Mexico area, marking Impact&#x27;s first show in Mexico since 2019.

== Features ==

=== X Division ===
The X Division is known for its high-flying, high-risk style matches. While most wrestlers who perform are under , thus being cruiserweights, Impact would emphasize the high-risk nature of the moves that these wrestlers perform by removing all restraints from competing in the X Division and allowing wrestlers to perform almost stunt-like moves. Because of this, wrestlers such as Samoa Joe, billed at , Kurt Angle, billed at , and Abyss, billed at , have also competed in the division. The slogan &quot;It&#x27;s not about weight limits, it&#x27;s about no limits&quot; has been used throughout the years to describe the division.

In August 2011, a weight limit was introduced, though it was quietly repealed in March 2012. Further changes introduced in March 2013, including a weight limit of 230 lbs, and all matches being contested as triple threat matches, were also repealed in August.

=== Six-sided ring ===

From the promotion&#x27;s first show in June 2002, a standard four-sided wrestling ring was used. In June 2004, with the premiere of &quot;Impact!&quot;, TNA switched to a six-sided ring, as occasionally used in AAA. The six-sided ring would be retired in January 2010, only making a brief return for the 2011 Destination X event. In 2014, after a fan-voted poll to determine what type of ring the company would use from June 2014, the six-sided ring would return. The promotion would continue to use the six-sided ring until January 2018, when it went back to a traditional four-sided ring.

=== Knockouts ===
&quot;Knockout&quot; is a term used by the company to refer to its female talent. The term is applied universally to wrestlers, backstage interviewers, and managers/valets. The division was established in 2002 mostly consisting of female valets and managers who were not competing often during the company&#x27;s inception in 2002 until 2006; it became a permanent women&#x27;s division in 2007 known as the TNA Knockouts Division that consisted of women such as Gail Kim, Angelina Love, Velvet Sky and Awesome Kong. The division features the TNA Knockouts World Championship and the TNA Knockouts World Tag Team Championships. The TNA Knockouts were formerly known as the &quot;Women of TNA&quot;, and &quot;Ladies of TNA&quot;.

=== Contracts ===

TNA wrestlers are forbidden by contract from working for other companies with televised wrestling shows, but are free to perform non-televised work for any other independent wrestling promotions, domestic or international, as well as televised events held by foreign promotions that Impact Wrestling is linked to or has a working relationship with (such as AAA and NOAH). Many Impact wrestlers perform regularly for various promotions on the independent circuit in addition to Impact Wrestling weekly shows. In 2012, the company changed its policy, preventing its talent from appearing at any independent events that are later released on DVD. Top wrestlers have guaranteed contracts, but the majority of the roster are paid on a per appearance basis. Impact wrestlers are classified as independent contractors and are not offered health coverage through the promotion. As of November 2017, Impact Wrestling contracts give the performers complete ownership over all intellectual property associated with their characters.

=== Hall of Fame ===

The Hall of Fame was introduced on May 31, 2012. As part of a yearly process, selected inductees are chosen based on their overall contributions to Impact&#x27;s history. On June 10, at Slammiversary 10, Sting was revealed as the first inductee into the Hall of Fame and his formal induction took place at Bound for Glory in October 2012.

== Partnerships ==
In early 2006, the promotion began a collaboration with Hermie Sadler&#x27;s United Wrestling Federation. The agreement permitted UWF to use the TNA logo on posters and signage, as well as to use the six-sided ring with TNA branding. These shows were mainly promoted as &#x27;UWF/TNA&#x27; events. The TNA name agreement ended at the end of 2006, as TNA began to promote their own house show events, though UWF still used a six-sided ring. These events were recorded and released on DVD by Highsports. They would continue to work with United Wrestling Federation and promote independent shows at the same time, until 2007.

TNA has worked with several wrestling promotions, with championships from those promotions sometimes having been defended at TNA events. Among the organizations TNA has had working relationships with are Mexico&#x27;s Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) from 2007 to 2009 and The Crash, Japan&#x27;s Inoki Genome Federation (IGF), New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Wrestle-1 (W-1), Pro Wrestling Noah (Noah), United States&#x27; the original Global Force Wrestling (another promotion founded by Jeff Jarrett), OMEGA Championship Wrestling (owned by Matt Hardy, Jeff Hardy and Gregory Helms) and Evolve Wrestling.

The initial relationship with NJPW lasted from 2008 to 2011. Then-known as TNA, the promotion would send wrestlers to participate in NJPW&#x27;s annual Wrestle Kingdom events, as well as NJPW sending future IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada on a training excursion to TNA. The relationship would be strained, when IWGP Tag Team Champions Team 3D were held off of a New Japan tour in favor of appearing on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; tapings and Okada was given the gimmick of &quot;Okato&quot;, where he dressed similar to The Green Hornet&#x27;s sidekick Kato. a decision Executive Vice President Scott D&#x27;Amore has since apologized for on behalf of the previous regime. In February 2021, Impact would re-established relationship with NJPW with NJPW later forgiving the incidents that happened under the previous regime. This partnership would last until December 2024, when NJPW&#x27;s contract to air on TNA&#x27;s co-owned TV home AXS TV expired, and was not renewed.

On March 2, 2014, TNA collaborated with Wrestle-1 in producing the supershow in Tokyo, Japan, where three TNA championships were defended. In May 2015, it was reported that the relationship between TNA and Wrestle-1 had ended.

Since 2015, the promotion has had a working agreement with Mexico&#x27;s Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) and in 2018, announced a partnership with the AAA-affiliated &quot;Lucha Underground&quot;, allowing their wrestlers from the show to appear for Impact on a regular basis. In April 2018, the two promotions held &quot;Impact vs Lucha Underground&quot; from WrestleCon in New Orleans to a sell out crowd. On November 26, 2023, Impact and partner promotion Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA), co-promoted the Ultra Clash supershow in the Monterrey, Mexico area, marking Impact&#x27;s first show in Mexico since 2019.

Since 2018, Impact has established working relationships with a number of promotions to co-promote house shows, Twitch specials, the final Impact One Night Only events, and Impact Plus Monthly Specials. These promotions include, Future Stars of Wrestling, Smash Wrestling, AML Wrestling, Superkick&#x27;d, Border City Wrestling, WrestleCade, Rocky Mountain Pro, Rockstar Pro Wrestling, Wrestlepro, Wrestling Revolver, RISE, Destiny Wrestling, Big Time Wrestling (California), DEFY Wrestling and House of Hardcore.

Impact Wrestling would begin a partnership with All Elite Wrestling in December 2020, with its wrestlers and titles appearing on Impact programming. In October 2021, the working relationship between Impact and AEW quietly ended following Bound for Glory.

On the January 7, 2022, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, it was announced that Knockouts Champion Mickie James would enter the 2022 Royal Rumble match. Both WWE&#x27;s official Twitter account and Impact&#x27;s website confirmed this soon after, with the former recognizing James as an Impact champion. Two years later, Knockouts Champion Jordynne Grace would enter in the Royal Rumble. In 2024, TNA and WWE began a wider talent exchange, with several TNA wrestlers appearing on WWE&#x27;s NXT brand, and NXT wrestlers making periodic appearances at TNA events. On January 16, 2025, WWE announced a multi-year partnership with TNA that allows NXT wrestlers and TNA wrestlers to appear in NXT shows, TNA iMPACT!, select WWE Premium Live Events, and TNA pay-per-views.

<doc id="454402" wikidata="Q617473" url="?curid=454402" title="Likert scale">
<text>A Likert scale ( ,) is a psychometric scale named after its inventor, American social psychologist Rensis Likert, which is commonly used in research questionnaires. It is the most widely used approach to scaling responses in survey research, such that the term (or more fully the Likert-type scale) is often used interchangeably with &quot;rating scale&quot;, although there are other types of rating scales.

Likert distinguished between a scale proper, which emerges from collective responses to a set of items (usually eight or more), and the format in which responses are scored along a range. Technically speaking, a Likert scale refers only to the former. The difference between these two concepts has to do with the distinction Likert made between the underlying phenomenon being investigated and the means of capturing variation that points to the underlying phenomenon.

When responding to a Likert item, respondents specify their level of agreement or disagreement on a symmetric agree-disagree scale for a series of statements. Thus, the range captures the intensity of their feelings for a given item.

A scale can be created as the simple sum or average of questionnaire responses over the set of individual items (questions). In so doing, Likert scaling assumes distances between each choice (answer option) are equal. Many researchers employ a set of such items that are highly correlated (that show high internal consistency) but also that together will capture the full domain under study (which requires less-than perfect correlations). Others hold to a standard by which &quot;All items are assumed to be replications of each other or in other words items are considered to be parallel instruments&quot;. By contrast, modern test theory treats the difficulty of each item (the ICCs) as information to be incorporated in scaling items.

== Composition ==
A &quot;Likert scale&quot; is the sum of responses on several &quot;Likert item&quot;s. Because many Likert scales pair each constituent Likert item with its own instance of a visual analogue scale (e.g., a horizontal line, on which the subject indicates a response by circling or checking tick-marks), an individual item is itself sometimes erroneously referred to as being or having a scale, with this error creating pervasive confusion in the literature and parlance of the field.

A Likert item is simply a statement that the respondent is asked to evaluate by giving it a quantitative value on any kind of subjective or objective dimension, with level of agreement/disagreement being the dimension most commonly used. Well-designed Likert items exhibit both &quot;symmetry&quot; and &quot;balance&quot;. Symmetry means that they contain equal numbers of positive and negative positions whose respective distances apart are bilaterally symmetric about the &quot;neutral&quot;/zero value (whether or not that value is presented as a candidate). Balance means that the distance between each candidate value is the same, allowing for quantitative comparisons such as averaging to be valid across items containing more than two candidate values.

The format of a typical five-level Likert item, for example, could be:
# Strongly disagree
# Disagree
# Neither agree nor disagree
# Agree
# Strongly agree

Likert scaling is a bipolar scaling method, measuring either positive or negative response to a statement. Sometimes an even-point scale is used, where the middle option of &quot;neither agree nor disagree&quot; is not available. This is sometimes called a &quot;forced choice&quot; method, since the neutral option is removed. The neutral option can be seen as an easy option to take when a respondent is unsure, and so whether it is a true neutral option is questionable. A 1987 study found negligible differences between the use of &quot;undecided&quot; and &quot;neutral&quot; as the middle option in a five-point Likert scale.

 Likert scales may be subject to distortion from several causes. Respondents may:
* Avoid using extreme response categories (&quot;central tendency bias&quot;), especially out of a desire to avoid being perceived as having extremist views (an instance of social desirability bias). This effect may appear early in a test due to an expectation that questions which the subject has stronger views on may follow, such that on earlier questions one &quot;leaves room&quot; for stronger responses later in the test. This expectation creates bias that is especially pernicious in that its effects are not uniform throughout the test and cannot be corrected for through simple across-the-board normalization;
* Agree with statements as presented (&quot;acquiescence bias&quot;), for example, agreeing with both Statement A, and its opposite. This effect especially strong among children, people with developmental disabilities, elderly people, and individuals who are subjected to a culture of institutionalization that encourages and incentivizes eagerness to please;
* Disagree with sentences as presented out of a defensive desire to avoid making erroneous statements and/or avoid negative consequences that respondents may fear will result from their answers being used against them, especially if misinterpreted and/or taken out of context;
* Provide answers that they believe will be evaluated as indicating strength or lack of weakness/dysfunction (&quot;faking good&quot;);
* Provide answers that they believe will be evaluated as indicating weakness or presence of impairment/pathology (&quot;faking bad&quot;);
* Try to portray themselves or their organization in a light that they believe the examiner or society to consider more favorable than their true beliefs (&quot;social desirability bias&quot;, the intersubjective version of objective &quot;faking good&quot; discussed above);
* Try to portray themselves or their organization in a light that they believe the examiner or society to consider less favorable/more unfavorable than their true beliefs (&quot;norm defiance&quot;, the intersubjective version of objective &quot;faking bad&quot; discussed above).

Designing a scale with balanced keying (an equal number of positive and negative statements and, especially, an equal number of positive and negative statements regarding each position or issue in question) can obviate the problem of acquiescence bias, since acquiescence on positively keyed items will balance acquiescence on negatively keyed items, but defensive, central tendency, and social desirability biases are somewhat more problematic.

== Scoring and analysis ==

After the questionnaire is completed, each item may be analyzed separately or in some cases item responses may be summed to create a score for a group of items. Hence, Likert scales are often called summative scales.

Whether individual Likert items can be considered as interval-level data, or whether they should be treated as ordered-categorical data is the subject of considerable disagreement in the literature, with strong convictions on what are the most applicable methods. This disagreement can be traced back, in many respects, to the extent to which Likert items are interpreted as being ordinal data.

There are two primary considerations in this discussion. First, Likert scales are arbitrary. The value assigned to a Likert item has no objective numerical basis, either in terms of measure theory or scale (from which a distance metric can be determined). The value assigned to each Likert item is simply determined by the researcher designing the survey, who makes the decision based on a desired level of detail. However, by convention Likert items tend to be assigned progressive positive integer values. Likert scales typically range from 2 to 10 – with 3, 5, or, 7 being the most common. Further, this progressive structure of the scale is such that each successive Likert item is treated as indicating a &#x27;better&#x27; response than the preceding value. (This may differ in cases where reverse ordering of the Likert scale is needed).

The second, and possibly more important point, is whether the &quot;distance&quot; between each successive item category is equivalent, which is inferred traditionally. For example, in the above five-point Likert item, the inference is that the &#x27;distance&#x27; between category 1 and 2 is the same as between category 3 and 4. In terms of good research practice, an equidistant presentation by the researcher is important; otherwise a bias in the analysis may result. For example, a four-point Likert item with categories &quot;Poor&quot;, &quot;Average&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, and &quot;Very Good&quot; is unlikely to have all equidistant categories since there is only one category that can receive a below-average rating. This would arguably bias any result in favor of a positive outcome. On the other hand, even if a researcher presents what he or she believes are equidistant categories, it may not be interpreted as such by the respondent.

A good Likert scale, as above, will present a &quot;symmetry&quot; of categories about a midpoint with clearly defined linguistic qualifiers. In such symmetric scaling, equidistant attributes will typically be more clearly observed or, at least, inferred. It is when a Likert scale is symmetric and equidistant that it will behave more like an interval-level measurement. So while a Likert scale is indeed ordinal, if well presented it may nevertheless approximate an interval-level measurement. This can be beneficial since, if it was treated just as an ordinal scale, then some valuable information could be lost if the &#x27;distance&#x27; between Likert items were not available for consideration. The important idea here is that the appropriate type of analysis is dependent on how the Likert scale has been presented.

The validity of such measures depends on the underlying interval nature of the scale. If interval nature is assumed for a comparison of two groups, the paired samples -test is not inappropriate. If non-parametric tests are to be performed the Pratt (1959) modification to the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is recommended over the standard Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

Responses to several Likert questions may be summed providing that all questions use the same Likert scale and that the scale is a defensible approximation to an interval scale, in which case the central limit theorem allows treatment of the data as interval data measuring a latent variable. If the summed responses fulfill these assumptions, parametric statistical tests such as the analysis of variance can be applied. Typical cutoffs for thinking that this approximation will be acceptable is a minimum of four and preferably eight items in the sum.

To model binary Likert responses directly, they may be represented in a binomial form by summing agree and disagree responses separately. The chi-squared, Cochran&#x27;s Q test, or McNemar test are common statistical procedures used after this transformation. Non-parametric tests such as chi-squared test, Mann–Whitney test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, or Kruskal–Wallis test. are often used in the analysis of Likert scale data.

Alternatively, Likert scale responses can be analyzed with an ordered probit model, preserving the ordering of responses without the assumption of an interval scale. The use of an ordered probit model can prevent errors that arise when treating ordered ratings as interval-level measurements. Consensus-based assessment (CBA) can be used to create an objective standard for Likert scales in domains where no generally accepted or objective standard exists. Consensus-based assessment (CBA) can be used to refine or even validate generally accepted standards.

=== Latent variable models ===

A common practice for analyzing responses to collections of Likert scale items is to summarize them via a latent variable model, for example using factor analysis or item response theory.

==== Rasch model ====

Likert scale data can, in principle, be used as a basis for obtaining interval level estimates on a continuum by applying the polytomous Rasch model, when data can be obtained that fit this model. In addition, the polytomous Rasch model permits testing of the hypothesis that the statements reflect increasing levels of an attitude or trait, as intended. For example, application of the model often indicates that the neutral category does not represent a level of attitude or trait between the disagree and agree categories.

Not every set of Likert scaled items can be used for Rasch measurement. The data has to be thoroughly checked to fulfill the strict formal axioms of the model. However, the raw scores are the sufficient statistics for the Rasch measures, a deliberate choice by Georg Rasch, so, if you are prepared to accept the raw scores as valid, then you can also accept the Rasch measures as valid.

=== Visual presentation of Likert-type data ===
An important part of data analysis and presentation is the visualization (or plotting) of data. The subject of plotting Likert (and other) rating data is discussed at length in two papers by Robbins and Heiberger. In the first they recommend the use of what they call diverging stacked bar charts and compare them to other plotting styles. The second paper describes the use of the Likert function in the HH package for R, and gives many examples of its use. Another paper also provided Python code to create a clustered diverging stacked bar chart of 5-point Likert scale responses.

== Level of measurement ==

The five response categories are often believed to represent an interval level of measurement. However, this can only be the case if the intervals between the scale points correspond to empirical observations in a metric sense. Reips and Funke (2008) show that this criterion is much better met by a visual analogue scale. In fact, there may also appear phenomena which even question the ordinal scale level in Likert scales. For example, in a set of items , ,  rated with a Likert scale circular relations like  &gt; ,  &gt;  and  &gt;  can appear. This violates the axiom of transitivity for the ordinal scale.

Research by Labovitz and Traylor provide evidence that, even with rather large distortions of perceived distances between scale points, Likert-type items perform closely to scales that are perceived as equal intervals. So these items and other equal-appearing scales in questionnaires are robust to violations of the equal distance assumption many researchers believe are required for parametric statistical procedures and tests.

== Pronunciation ==

Rensis Likert, the developer of the scale, pronounced his name . Some have claimed that Likert&#x27;s name &quot;is among the most mispronounced in [the] field&quot;, because many people pronounce the name of the scale as .

<doc id="454403" wikidata="Q221989" url="?curid=454403" title="Deep web">
<text>The deep web, invisible web, or hidden web are parts of the World Wide Web whose contents are not indexed by standard web search-engine programs. This is in contrast to the &quot;surface web&quot;, which is accessible to anyone using the Internet. Computer scientist Michael K. Bergman is credited with inventing the term in 2001 as a search-indexing term.

Deep web sites can be accessed by a direct URL or IP address, but may require entering a password or other security information to access actual content. Uses of deep web sites include web mail, online banking, cloud storage, restricted-access social-media pages and profiles, and web forums that require registration for viewing content. It also includes paywalled services such as video on demand and some online magazines and newspapers.

==Terminology==

The first conflation of the terms &quot;deep web&quot; and &quot;dark web&quot; happened during 2009 when deep web search terminology was discussed together with illegal activities occurring on the Freenet and darknet. Those criminal activities include the commerce of personal passwords, false identity documents, drugs, firearms, and child pornography.

Since then, after their use in the media&#x27;s reporting on the black-market website Silk Road, media outlets have generally used &quot;deep web&quot; synonymously with the dark web or darknet, a comparison some reject as inaccurate and consequently has become an ongoing source of confusion. &quot;Wired&quot; reporters Kim Zetter and Andy Greenberg recommend the terms be used in distinct fashions. While the deep web is a reference to any site that cannot be accessed by a traditional search engine, the dark web is a portion of the deep web that has been hidden intentionally and is inaccessible by standard browsers and methods.

==Non-indexed content==
Bergman, in a paper on the deep web published in &quot;The Journal of Electronic Publishing&quot;, mentioned that Jill Ellsworth used the term &quot;Invisible Web&quot; in 1994 to refer to websites that were not registered with any search engine. Bergman cited a January 1996 article by Frank Garcia:

It would be a site that&#x27;s possibly reasonably designed, but they didn&#x27;t bother to register it with any of the search engines. So, no one can find them! You&#x27;re hidden. I call that the invisible Web.
Another early use of the term &quot;Invisible Web&quot; was by Bruce Mount and Matthew B. Koll of Personal Library Software, in a description of the No. 1 Deep Web program found in a December 1996 press release.

The first use of the specific term &quot;deep web&quot;, now generally accepted, occurred in the aforementioned 2001 Bergman study.

==Indexing methods==
Methods that prevent web pages from being indexed by traditional search engines may be categorized as one or more of the following:

# Contextual web: pages with content varying for different access contexts (e.g., ranges of client IP addresses or previous navigation sequence).
# Dynamic content: dynamic pages, which are returned in response to a submitted query or accessed only through a form, especially if open-domain input elements (such as text fields) are used; such fields are hard to navigate without domain knowledge.
# Limited access content: sites that limit access to their pages in a technical manner (e.g., using the Robots Exclusion Standard or CAPTCHAs, or no-store directive, which prohibit search engines from browsing them and creating cached copies). Sites may feature an internal search engine for exploring such pages.
# Non-HTML/text content: textual content encoded in multimedia (image or video) files or specific file formats not recognised by search engines.
# Private web: sites that require registration and login (password-protected resources).
# Scripted content: pages that are accessible only by links produced by JavaScript as well as content dynamically downloaded from Web servers via Flash or Ajax solutions.
# Software: certain content is hidden intentionally from the regular Internet, accessible only with special software, such as Tor, I2P, or other darknet software. For example, Tor allows users to access websites using the .onion server address anonymously, hiding their IP address.
# Unlinked content: pages which are not linked to by other pages, which may prevent web crawling programs from accessing the content. This content is referred to as pages without backlinks (also known as inlinks). Also, search engines do not always detect all backlinks from searched web pages.
# Web archives: Web archival services such as the Wayback Machine enable users to see archived versions of web pages across time, including websites that have become inaccessible and are not indexed by search engines such as Google. The Wayback Machine may be termed a program for viewing the deep web, as web archives that are not from the present cannot be indexed, as past versions of websites are impossible to view by a search. All websites are updated at some time, which is why web archives are considered Deep Web content.

==Content types==
While it is not always possible to discover directly a specific web server&#x27;s content so that it may be indexed, a site potentially can be accessed indirectly (due to computer vulnerabilities).

To discover content on the web, search engines use web crawlers that follow hyperlinks through known protocol virtual port numbers. This technique is ideal for discovering content on the surface web but is often ineffective at finding deep web content. For example, these crawlers do not attempt to find dynamic pages that are the result of database queries due to the indeterminate number of queries that are possible. It has been noted that this can be overcome (partially) by providing links to query results, but this could unintentionally inflate the popularity of a site of the deep web.

DeepPeep, Intute, Aleph Open Search, Deep Web Technologies, Scirus, and Ahmia.fi are a few search engines that have accessed the deep web. Intute ran out of funding and is now a temporary static archive as of July 2011. Scirus retired near the end of January 2013.

Researchers have been exploring how the deep web can be crawled in an automatic fashion, including content that can be accessed only by special software such as Tor. In 2001, Sriram Raghavan and Hector Garcia-Molina (Stanford Computer Science Department, Stanford University) presented an architectural model for a hidden-Web crawler that used important terms provided by users or collected from the query interfaces to query a Web form and crawl the Deep Web content. Alexandros Ntoulas, Petros Zerfos, and Junghoo Cho of UCLA created a hidden-Web crawler that automatically generated meaningful queries to issue against search forms. Several form query languages (e.g., DEQUEL) have been proposed that, besides issuing a query, also allow extraction of structured data from result pages. Another effort is DeepPeep, a project of the University of Utah sponsored by the National Science Foundation, which gathered hidden-web sources (web forms) in different domains based on novel focused crawler techniques.

Commercial search engines have begun exploring alternative methods to crawl the deep web. The Sitemap Protocol (first developed, and introduced by Google in 2005) and OAI-PMH are mechanisms that allow search engines and other interested parties to discover deep web resources on particular web servers. Both mechanisms allow web servers to advertise the URLs that are accessible on them, thereby allowing automatic discovery of resources that are not linked directly to the surface web. Google&#x27;s deep web surfacing system computes submissions for each HTML form and adds the resulting HTML pages into the Google search engine index. The surfaced results account for a thousand queries per second to deep web content. In this system, the pre-computation of submissions is done using three algorithms:
# selecting input values for text search inputs that accept keywords,
# identifying inputs that accept only values of a specific type (e.g., date) and
# selecting a small number of input combinations that generate URLs suitable for inclusion into the Web search index.

In 2008, to facilitate users of Tor hidden services in their access and search of a hidden .onion suffix, Aaron Swartz designed Tor2web—a proxy application able to provide access by means of common web browsers. Using this application, deep web links appear as a random sequence of letters followed by the .onion top-level domain.

<doc id="454410" wikidata="Q89544921" url="?curid=454410" title="Kyrielle">
<text>The kyrielle is a poetic form that originated in 15th century French troubadour poetry.

== Name and form ==

The name kyrielle derives from the &quot;Kýrie&quot;, which is part of many Christian liturgies. A traditional kyrielle is written in octosyllabic rhyming couplets, which are typically paired in quatrains. Typically, a kyrielle will use the phrase &quot;Lord, have mercy&quot; or a variation as a refrain as the second line of the couplet or last line of the quatrain. However, some kyrielles use other phrases or words for the refrain. There is no prescribed number of stanzas in a kyrielle, but most have at least three. 

There are a number of possible rhyme schemes for a kyrielle, though the refrain is always the final line of each stanza. English kyrielles include Thomas Campion&#x27;s &quot;With broken heart and contrite sigh&quot; and John Payne&#x27;s &quot;A lark in the mesh of the tangled vine.&quot;

<doc id="454413" wikidata="Q18414898" url="?curid=454413" title="Maltese nobility">
<text>The feudal system was first established in Malta by the Kingdom of Sicily, which conquered the island between 1090 and 1091. The Sicilian titles were abolished after the Arab occupation of Malta. From 1530 to 1798 the island was ruled by the Knights Hospitaller (who became known as the Knights of Malta), and from 1800 to 1964 by the British. The Knights and the British both undertook to maintain the rights and privileges of the Maltese.

In the later nineteenth century the British government gave official recognition to several noble titles that had been created by the Grand Masters of the Knights of Malta and other &quot;fontes honorum&quot;. There were 29 title holders: nine marquises, ten counts and ten barons. The nobles were styled &quot;The Most Noble&quot; and took precedence among themselves according to the date of creation of their titles. Some nobles were also styled as &quot;Illustrissimo&quot;, which was however, disputed by Grand Master Vilhena. In the Italian fashion, their heirs-apparent were styled &quot;marchesino&quot;, &quot;contino&quot; or &quot;baroncino&quot;, as appropriate.

Malta became an independent state in 1964 and a republic in 1974. Official recognition of titles of nobility by the Government of Malta were abolished in 1975.

Even today, there are still Maltese noble families who live in Malta.

<doc id="454416" wikidata="Q236675" url="?curid=454416" title="Liv Grete Skjelbreid">
<text>Liv Grete Skjelbreid (born 7 July 1974) from Hålandsdal, Fusa, near the city of Bergen in western Norway, is a former professional biathlete. On 20 March 2006, Liv Grete announced her retirement, effective at the end of the season which ended on 26 March at the Holmenkollen. She said that she was retiring because of her young daughter, Emma, her family and because she did not have the motivation to continue.

==Early career==
As a child Skjelbreid spent a lot of her time with her older sisters, and consequently took part in the sports her sisters did. She played football, kayaked in the lake next to the family home, cross-country skied, and she used to run up to the family cottage up in the mountains, touch the wall and run back down.

Skjelbreid excelled in football and biathlon, and first started competing in biathlon when she was nine. She borrowed her father&#x27;s rifle for her first race. He also built a small shooting range on the family’s farm so his young daughters could practice. However, as she was finishing high school, she was undecided as to whether continue with biathlon or to become a hairdresser. She, then, received an offer from a new sports school, which developed young talent, based in Geilo, to train and study there, still she was undecided, but her friends and family succeeded in persuading her to attend the school, and that after the first year if she did not like it, she could then leave. It turned out that Skjelbreid did enjoy the school, and was in the same year as Ole Einar Bjørndalen, and was taught by Odd Lirhus, who would become her coach between 2003 and 2006.

==World Cup==
Skjelbreid won the IBU overall World Cup once, in the 2003–04 season, it was also the first for Norway since Anne Elvebakk won the event in 1988. She won the overall title by 95 points over Olga Pyleva, and took three of the four individual disciplines, the sprint, pursuit and mass start. She came fourth in the individual. Norway also won the relay.
Her first season was in 1995/96, she finished 30th. In her next season, 1998/99, she shot up the table and came 5th in the end. The year after however she finished 21st. In 2000/01 Skjelbreid finished the season in 2nd place, 217 points behind Magdalena Forsberg. She was 2nd in the sprint, pursuit and mass start, and came 3rd in the individual. Norway won the relay. She also came second the year after, again behind Forsberg, this time by 149 points. She was 2nd in the individual, sprint and pursuit, and 9th in the mass start. Norway came 2nd in the relay. Skjelbreid missed the 2002/03 season because of her pregnancy. However, the year after she captured the crystal globe of the World Cup. Although, 2004/05 was a poor year, Skjelbreid had to retire from the season due to illness, missing the World Championships in the process. She ended up in 22nd place, 532 points behind Sandrine Bailly. She was suffering from a virus closely related to mononucleosis (glandular fever). The virus took away about 15–20 percent of her energy according to Lars Kolsrud, doctor for Norway&#x27;s biathlon squads.

Skjelbreid finished the 2005/06 season in 12th place, 511 points behind the overall winner Kati Wilhelm. She ended in 21st place in the individual, 64 points down on Svetlana Ishmouratova. She was 12th in the sprint, 190 behind Wilhelm. Her best standing was in the pursuit, where she finished the season in 9th place, 177 points behind Wilhelm, and she finished 13th in the mass start, with 90 points less than Martina Glagow. Norway were 4th in the relay.

Skjelbreid was a steady shooter over the years. Her overall percentage was in the high 70% – low 80%. As with the vast majority of biathletes, her prone shoot was her best, averaging mid 80% shooting, whilst her standing shoot gradually got better, from 65% in 1999/00 to 74% in the 2005/06 season. Skjelbreid achieved 46 podium finishes, 22 in first place, 15 in second, and 9 in third place.

Skjelbreid was coached by Rolf Sæterdal until 2003, when he died suddenly. Then she was coached by Odd Lirhus until 2006, when she retired.

Skjelbreid won the Holmenkollen ski festival biathlon competition four times with two wins each in sprint (2000, 2001) and in mass start (2000, 2004).

===Individual victories===
&quot;22 victories (10 Sp, 8 Pu, 1 In, 3 MS)&quot; 

:&quot;*Results are from IBU races which include the Biathlon World Cup, Biathlon World Championships and the Winter Olympic Games.&quot;

==Olympics==

Skjelbreid competed in three Olympic games, the first in 1998 in Nagano. She has three medals, two silver and one bronze, two of them (one silver &amp; one bronze) came in the relay (1998 and 2002), the other silver came in the individual in 2002. Her medal count, especially her solo medal count is quite poor for a biathlete of her calibre, though she did come fourth in both the sprint and the pursuit in 2002. Her 2006 results were poor, much in the same pattern as the Norwegian Olympic team on the whole. She finished 9th in the individual, 12th in the sprint, 6th in the pursuit, 18th in the mass start, and 5th in the relay (although Skjelbreid did run a solid anchor leg).

&quot;3 medals (2 silver, 1 bronze)&quot;
==World championships==
Skjelbreid has 13 World Championship medals: 8 gold, three silver and two bronze. She won four of her gold medals in a single Championships, in Oberhof in 2004, the first time a biathlete has won four golds in a single World Championships. Her first World Championship medal was a silver in the relay in Brezno-Osrblie, Slovakia in 1997. She then had to wait until 2000 for her first individual medal. She won two golds in Holmenkollen, in the sprint and the mass start. In 2001 in Pokljuka, she won a gold in the pursuit, a silver in the individual, and a bronze in both the sprint and mass start. Her next Championships was in 2004, where she took the four golds. The one event she did not win was the individual where she finished eighth. She suffered from illness in the 2004–05 season, and came 37th in the sprint, and did not start in the pursuit. During the 2003–04 season, Skjelbreid was handed the wrong gold medal after she won Sunday&#x27;s 7.5 km race. She was given the medal for the 15 km event, which wasn&#x27;t taking place until Tuesday.

&quot;12 medals (8 gold, 3 silver, 2 bronze)&quot;

:&quot;*Team was removed as an event in 1998, and pursuit was added in 1997 with mass start being added in 1999 and the mixed relay in 2005.&quot;

==Injuries==
Skjelbreid suffered a spate of injuries throughout her career. In the summer of 1995 she broke her wrist whilst swinging on monkey bars, then in the summer of 1997 she was jumping on a chair, fell and broke her elbow. She then broke the cast when she crashed while training on roller skis days later.
She also suffers from chronic inflammation, but she has said it had got better since she gave birth. There was also the illness that drained her energy and forced her to finish the 2004/05 season early.

==Personal life==
Liv Grete Skjelbreid grew up on a dairy farm in Hålandsdal. One of her two sisters Ann Elen also had a career as a biathlete. Ann Elen skied the first leg of the relay in Nagano 1998 when Norway came third, with Liv Grete skiing the anchor leg. Her brother-in-law is Norwegian biathlete Egil Gjelland.

Skjelbreid married French biathlete Raphaël Poirée on 27 May 2000 in Norway. They first met at the 1992 Junior World Championships and began dating in 1996. They have three daughters, Emma (born 27 January 2003), Anna (born 10 January 2007) and Lena (born 10 October 2008). 
The family have spent most of their time in Norway and have a house in Eikelandsosen, near Skjelbreid&#x27;s childhood home. They also kept a small apartment in Villard-de-Lans, France, site of the 1968 Olympic luge venue. In July 2013, the couple announced that they were separating.

The oldest daughter Emma traveled with the Poirées to all of their biathlon events, with a full-time nanny (older sister Ann Elen) for the first two years. But Emma was sick several times over those two seasons, and the family decided she should remain at home during the buildup to the Olympic games in Torino, and only travel with them every third race weekend. So during the 2006 Olympic season Emma stayed with her maternal grandparents.

<text>Leonard Hilton McGurr (born November 17, 1955), known as Futura, and formerly known as Futura 2000, is an American contemporary artist and former graffiti artist.

==Biography==
He started to paint illegally on New York City&#x27;s subway in the early 1970s, working with other artists such as ALI. From 1974 to 1978, he served in the U.S. Navy and traveled all over the world. In the early 1980s he showed with Patti Astor at the Fun Gallery, along with Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Richard Hambleton and Kenny Scharf.

Futura painted backdrops live on-stage for British punk rock band The Clash&#x27;s 1981 European tour. In 1985, he was on the first meeting of the graffiti and urban art movement in Bondy (France), on the VLP&#x27;s initiative, with Speedy Graphito, Miss Tic, SP 38, Epsylon Point, Blek le Rat, Jef Aérosol, Nuklé-Art, Kim Prisu, Banlieue-Banlieue. More recently, he is a successful graphic designer and gallery artist.

One of the most distinctive features of Futura&#x27;s work is his abstract approach to graffiti. While the primary focus, during the 1980s, of the majority of graffiti artists was lettering, Futura pioneered abstract street art, which has since become more popular. Conversely, his aerosol strokes are regarded as different from those of his peers, as they are as thin as the fine lines usually associated with the use of an airbrush.

While he is primarily known as a graffiti artist, much of his work is as an illustrator and graphic designer of album covers, first becoming involved with The Clash; producing a sleeve for their &quot;This Is Radio Clash&quot; 7&quot; single and handwriting the sleeve notes and lyrics sheet for their album &quot;Combat Rock&quot; (1982). He also toured extensively with The Clash during the &quot;Combat Rock&quot; tours, &quot;performing&quot; with them on stage by spray painting backdrops whilst the band performed. His rap appeared on the Clash song &quot;Overpowered by Funk.&quot;

Years later James Lavelle resurrected Futura&#x27;s career by getting him, alongside Ben Drury, to produce the artwork for several releases on Mo&#x27; Wax records; this also led to Futura producing the imagery which has largely defined Lavelle&#x27;s Unkle project.

During the 1990s he was involved with clothing companies such as GFS, Subware and Project Dragon. More recently much of Futura&#x27;s artwork has evolved into the production of collectible toys, sneakers; and a diverse range of creative media, working with Recon, Nike, Medicom Toy, Undercover, Supreme, Levi&#x27;s and A Bathing Ape.

Futura also designs his own clothing under the label Futura Laboratories with a store located in Fukuoka, Japan.

Futura was interviewed and featured in the 2005 sneaker documentary &quot;Just For Kicks.&quot;

Futura appeared as himself in the 2006 action-adventure video game &quot;Marc Ecko&#x27;s Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure&quot; alongside other notable graffiti artists.

His 2012 exhibition &quot;Future-Shock&quot; was curated by Nemo Librizzi and shown by Andy Valmorbida in New York City. Past galleries who have organized one man exhibitions include Fun Gallery, Tony Shafrazi Gallery, Philippe Briet Gallery, Galerie du Jour Agnès B., and Galerie Jérôme de Noirmont. Museum exhibitions include &quot;New York / New Wave&quot; at PS1 (1981), &quot;Coming from the Subway&quot; at Groninger Museum (1992), &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; (2004) and &quot;Art in the Streets&quot; at Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2011).

In 2012, Futura designed the special edition Hennessy V.S. bottle.

In 2017, Futura designed a collection of T-shirts with Uniqlo.

In 2019, Futura designed a pointman bobblehead, a baseball jersey, and a baseball cap with the New York Mets.

In late 2019, Futura collaborated with Funko to design decals for a Star wars line sold exclusively at Target. Two designs were falsely claimed to be his but were in fact designed in-house by Funko [Red and Black Boba Fetts, both the 4 and 10 inch variants].

In 2020, Futura designed in collaboration with BMW a bespoke series of vehicles that were shown at Frieze LA 2020 in Los Angeles, US.

In September 2020 a pair of Nike sneakers that he designed, known as the &quot;Leonard Hilton McGurr ‘Futura’ Nike Dunk High Pro SB ‘FLOM’&quot; sold at auction for US$63,000.

<text>Jesús María Ciriaco Jiménez Zamora (June 18, 1823 – February 12, 1897) was President of Costa Rica on two occasions: 1863 to 1866, and 1868 to 1870.

He was popularly elected in 1863, but dissolved Congress two months into his term of office. During his presidency he granted asylum to former Salvadoran President Gen. Gerardo Barrios, as a result of which the other four Central American governments broke off diplomatic relations with Costa Rica.

He passed on the presidency democratically to José María Castro Madriz at the end of his mandate in 1866, only to overthrow him in a coup d&#x27;état two years later and assume the office of president for a second time. This second mandate, in turn, came to an end in a coup on 27 April 1870.

Jesús Jiménez was the father of three-time President Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno.

<text>Richard Mirando, known as Seen, is an American graffiti artist. He is one of the best known graffiti artists in the world and has been referred to as the Godfather of Graffiti.

Seen first started to paint on the New York City Subway system in 1973.

He was born in the Bronx, New York City.

==Life==
For the next 16 years he painted pieces across the city and on all subway routes, but they were especially prominent on the 2, 5, and 6 trains. He was responsible for dozens of whole-car top-to-bottoms, many of which have become iconic images of the time.

During the very early 1980s he started producing work on canvas, shown by galleries and bought by museums and private collectors. He continued to paint New York City subway trains until 1989, long after increased pressure from the MTA had stopped many from doing so. He was included in the 1983 PBS documentary &quot;Style Wars&quot;.

In the late 1980s he also undertook tattoo art, opening Tattoo Seen, a tattoo parlor which became one of the most successful studios in New York City. His more recent work includes three-dimensional sculpture, mixed media work with reclaimed or discarded materials (often found in the street), and a series of hand-painted MTA New York subway maps. He continues to exhibit worldwide and produce work with and alongside artists such as Banksy.

In 2009, the Seen Gallery opened in Paris before becoming the Seen Studios, France.

He has focused on painting comic book heroes. He has his own clothing line that prints t-shirts with his lettering and comic hero renderings.

<text>José María Castro Madriz (1 September 1818 – 4 April 1892) was a Costa Rican lawyer, academic, diplomat, and politician. He served twice as President of Costa Rica, from 1848 to 1849, and from 1866 to 1868. On both occasions he was prevented from completing his term of office by military coups. During his first administration, on 31 August 1848, he formally declared Costa Rica an independent republic, definitively severing Costa Rica&#x27;s ties to the moribund Federal Republic of Central America.

==Life==
Castro was born in San José. He was the son of Ramón Castro y Ramírez and Lorenza Madriz Cervantes. He was educated at the University of León in Nicaragua, where he graduated as bachelor of philosophy and doctor of law. He occupied many public offices throughout his life, both before and after serving as President. He was the rector of the national University (which he had helped to create) for sixteen years, and served several administrations as cabinet minister and ambassador. He also presided over the judiciary (as chief judge of the Supreme Court of Justice from 1860 to 1866 and from 1870 to 1873) and the legislature (as president of the Congress of Deputies in 1844-1845 and of the fourth Constitutional Convention in 1859), making him the only other Costa Rican besides Ricardo Jiménez to have headed all three branches of the government.

An active Freemason, Castro was consistently critical of the political influence of the Roman Catholic Church. He was also a strong defender of freedom of the press at a time when many Costa Rican governments practiced widespread censorship. His constitutional reform of 1848, however, established the most restricted suffrage that ever existed in independent Costa Rica. As president his lack of a committed political base made him an easy target for overthrow by the military. As the minister of foreign affairs, education, justice, public aid, and religious affairs, Castro was the most influential figure in the government of his brother-in-law, President Próspero Fernández (1882–1885), and he was largely responsible for the anti-clerical legislation adopted by that government.

He was married to Pacífica Fernández, who designed the 1848 version of the Costa Rican flag. His daughter Cristina Fernández Castro married Minor C. Keith in 1883. Their grandson, Rafael Yglesias, served as President of Costa Rica from 1894 to 1902.

Inaugurated at age 29, he was the youngest person to ever serve as President of Costa Rica.

<doc id="454439" wikidata="Q420706" url="?curid=454439" title="Hedvig Sophia of Sweden">
<text>Hedvig Sophia Augusta of Sweden (26 June 1681 – 22 December 1708), Duchess of Holstein-Gottorp, was the eldest child of Charles XI of Sweden and Ulrike Eleonore of Denmark. She was heiress presumptive to the Swedish throne from her birth until that of her brother one year later and again from the start of his reign as King of Sweden, in 1697, until her death and the regent of the duchy of Holstein-Gottorp for her minor son from 1702 to 1708. Some sources refer to her as Sofia.

==Youth==

Hedvig Sophia spent the majority of her upbringing at Karlberg Palace. After the death of her mother in 1693, she and her siblings were placed under the custody of her grandmother Hedvig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. Her personal caretaker was Juliana Schierberg, who was to be her lifelong and influential confidante. 
Hedvig Sophia was, and continued to be, the favorite of her grandmother. Due to her grandmother&#x27;s influence, she came to harbor anti-Danish views. She was described as beautiful, passionate but dignified, and as a good student, particularly in painting. She was also noted to be cheerful in the otherwise strict Swedish court, and it was noted that her father spent more money on her than he was usually willing to do on other things.

Between 1697 and 1699, there was a Danish policy to create an alliance with Sweden through a double wedding between Charles XII of Sweden and Princess Sophia Hedwig of Denmark, and Prince Charles of Denmark and Hedvig Sophia of Sweden (after the marriage of Hedvig Sophia in 1698, she was replaced by Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden). Jens Juel (diplomat) are known to have engaged Beata Elisabet von Königsmarck to promote the matches. However, none of the marriages was materialized.

==Duchess consort==

On 12 May 1698 at Karlberg she married her cousin, Frederick IV, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. Her marriage was arranged as a part of the traditional Swedish policy of alliance with Holstein-Gottorp against Denmark; her brother had earlier been expected to marry Frederick&#x27;s sister, but he refused. The marriage, which had been decided upon during her childhood, took place against her consent and was not happy. She did not like the debauched life of Frederick IV, for which he was known even before their marriage.

She visited Holstein-Gottorp in 1698 and remained there for about a year. During Hedvig Sophia&#x27;s stay in Gottorp, Frederick regularly visited his lovers in Hamburg and also brought some of them to Gottorp. Her Mistress of the Robes, Beata Magdalena Wittenberg, became involved in a physical argument with a male courtier who acted as the pimp of Frederick, an argument which ended with Wittenberg losing her wig and Hedvig Sophia&#x27;s demand to return to Sweden.

In 1699 she returned to Sweden, where she was second in line to the Swedish throne and presumptive heir. She resided mainly at Karlberg. Hedvig Sophia was an eager participant in the frequent partying that dominated her brother&#x27;s court for a few years before the Great Northern War, and she spent most of her life at the Swedish court. Her marriage was the start point of a long series of festivities which lasted until her departure, and upon her return, another series of festivities was launched which lasted until the outbreak of the war.

Hedvig Sophia was regarded to have political influence over her brother the monarch: on 1 October 1702, count Magnus Stenbock gave his spouse countess Eva Oxenstierna the task of using her influence in the parliament to contact Hedvig Sophia and ask her to make Charles XII to end the war and ask for peace.

==Regent==
On 18 October 1702, Hedvig Sofia became a widow and formal Regent for her minor son, the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. However, she spent most of her time in Sweden and rarely visited the home of her spouse: she left the daily affairs of the duchy to Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp, the uncle of her late spouse, but matters of major importance were always to be confirmed by her. She did have plans to visit Holstein-Gottorp in 1705, but her brother asked her to remain in Sweden, which she consented to do. 
As Regent, Hedvig Sophia made sure that the old policy of Holstein-Gottorp was kept, with an alliance with Sweden as protection against Denmark. This led to some strain relation with the administration in Holstein-Gottorp, who was considering a different alliance, but she kept in control of the policy and her line was kept until her death without it leading to any open conflict.

In Sweden, she worked to have her son accepted as an heir to the Swedish throne, and the &quot;Holstein Party&quot;, as it was to be called after the death of her brother, was also the most successful contestant under her leadership until her death in 1708. As a widow, she was the object of plans to arrange a new political marriage. Among the candidates were the Crown Prince of Hanover, that is the future King George II of Great Britain. However, she refused a new arranged marriage. She was by then involved with the young courtier count Olof Gyllenborg. She was acquainted with Gyllenborg since before her marriage, and after the death of her spouse, he made it known to her that he was in love with her through a poem with the message that it was better to confess to a love than to let it die. That relationship was open public knowledge at court and seems to have been accepted, though much disliked by her grandmother, Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp.

At the Swedish royal court, Hedvig Sophia was described as a beauty with an interest in fashion, and referred to as &quot;The Happy Princess&quot;. She was the center of the social life at court, and it was said that all pleasure of court life ended after her death. She was an accomplished singer: during the Great Northern war, she appeared as a singer at concerts at court, while her sister, Ulrika Eleonora, played the clavier. 
Like her sister, she repeatedly asked her brother for permission to visit him on the battle field during the war, which was common for many other women to do, but he refused them every time.

In 1708 she died of smallpox, which she had contracted by nursing her son through the illness. The relationship between her and her brother, King Carl, was very deep. In July 1709, her brother, who recently had become a refugee of his military catastrophe at Poltava and was far away in Bendery (today in Moldavia) finally received the news of Hedvig Sophia&#x27;s death in Stockholm the previous December. Carl at first refused to believe it, and this was the only time he was ever known to have wept. It was &quot;an event which I had trusted never to be so unhappy to survive&quot; and he suffered from &quot;that grief which can never altogether leave me until those who have been parted shall meet again&quot;. Hedvig Sophia&#x27;s proper funeral and interment in Riddarholm Church did not take place until 1718, after the death of Carl. She was temporarily interred in 1708, but her permanent funeral was delayed awaiting her brother&#x27;s orders from how it should be conducted. In 1716, however, she was hastily buried along with her grandmother without him being asked, as they were worried that he would insist on a funeral of a kind which the country could no longer afford.

She is perhaps most well known for the extensive correspondence between her and her brother King Carl XII, who spent much of his life on war campaigns abroad. When he died in 1718 and left no heirs to the throne, the late Hedvig Sophia&#x27;s only child, Duke Karl Friedrich was in line to succeed him, but the late king&#x27;s younger sister Ulrica Eleonora quickly moved herself onto the throne instead.

Hedvig Sophia was the paternal grandmother of Emperor Peter III of Russia.

<text>Jeremy Halvard Prynne (born 24 June 1936) is a British poet closely associated with the British Poetry Revival.

Prynne grew up in Kent and was educated at St Dunstan&#x27;s College, Catford, and Jesus College, Cambridge. He is a Life Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He retired in October 2005 from his posts teaching English Literature as a Lecturer and University Reader in English Poetry for the University of Cambridge and as Director of Studies in English for Gonville and Caius College; in September 2006 he retired from his position as Librarian of the College.

Prynne&#x27;s early influences include Donald Davie and Charles Olson. He was one of the key figures in the Cambridge group among the British Poetry Revival poets and a major contributor to &quot;The English Intelligencer&quot;. His first book, &quot;Force of Circumstance and Other Poems&quot;, was published in 1962, but Prynne has excluded it from his canon. His &quot;Poems&quot; (1982) collected all the work he wanted to keep in print, beginning with &quot;Kitchen Poems&quot; (1968), with expanded and updated editions appearing in 1999, 2005, and 2015. 2020 to 2022 has seen an unprecedented burst of productivity, with the publication of over two dozen small press chapbooks and several substantial collections, including book-length poems, sequences and a poetic novel.
In addition to his poetry, Prynne has published some critical and academic prose. A transcription of a 1971 lecture on Olson&#x27;s &quot;Maximus Poems&quot; at Simon Fraser University has had wide circulation. His longer works include a monograph on Ferdinand de Saussure, &quot;Stars, Tigers and the Shape of Words&quot;, and self-published, very erudite book-length commentaries on individual poems by Shakespeare (Sonnets 94 and 15), George Herbert (&quot;Love III&quot;) and Wordsworth (&quot;The Solitary Reaper&quot;). His long and passionate interest in China (he was a close friend and colleague of Joseph Needham) is reflected in an essay on &quot;New Songs from a Jade Terrace&quot;, an anthology of early Chinese love poetry, which was included in the second edition of the book from Penguin (1982). His collected poetry includes a poem composed in classical Chinese under the name Pu Ling-en (蒲龄恩), reproduced in his own calligraphy. In 2016, a lengthy interview with Prynne about his poetic practice appeared in &quot;The Paris Review&quot; as part of its &quot;The Art of Poetry&quot; series.

<text>Abstraction in mathematics is the process of extracting the underlying structures, patterns or properties of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena. In other words, to be abstract is to remove context and application. Two of the most highly abstract areas of modern mathematics are category theory and model theory.

==Description==

Many areas of mathematics began with the study of real world problems, before the underlying rules and concepts were identified and defined as abstract structures. For example, geometry has its origins in the calculation of distances and areas in the real world, and algebra started with methods of solving problems in arithmetic.

Abstraction is an ongoing process in mathematics and the historical development of many mathematical topics exhibits a progression from the concrete to the abstract. For example, the first steps in the abstraction of geometry were historically made by the ancient Greeks, with Euclid&#x27;s Elements being the earliest extant documentation of the axioms of plane geometry—though Proclus tells of an earlier axiomatisation by Hippocrates of Chios. In the 17th century, Descartes introduced Cartesian co-ordinates which allowed the development of analytic geometry. Further steps in abstraction were taken by Lobachevsky, Bolyai, Riemann and Gauss, who generalised the concepts of geometry to develop non-Euclidean geometries. Later in the 19th century, mathematicians generalised geometry even further, developing such areas as geometry in &quot;n&quot; dimensions, projective geometry, affine geometry and finite geometry. Finally Felix Klein&#x27;s &quot;Erlangen program&quot; identified the underlying theme of all of these geometries, defining each of them as the study of properties invariant under a given group of symmetries. This level of abstraction revealed connections between geometry and abstract algebra.

In mathematics, abstraction can be advantageous in the following ways:

* It reveals deep connections between different areas of mathematics.
* Known results in one area can suggest conjectures in another related area.
* Techniques and methods from one area can be applied to prove results in other related areas.
*Patterns from one mathematical object can be generalized to other similar objects in the same class.

On the other hand, abstraction can also be disadvantageous in that highly abstract concepts can be difficult to learn. A degree of mathematical maturity and experience may be needed for conceptual assimilation of abstractions. 

Bertrand Russell, in &quot;The Scientific Outlook&quot; (1931), writes that &quot;Ordinary language is totally unsuited for expressing what physics really asserts, since the words of everyday life are not sufficiently abstract. Only mathematics and mathematical logic can say as little as the physicist means to say.&quot;

<text>José María Montealegre Fernández (19 March 1815 – September 26, 1887) was President of Costa Rica from 1859 to 1863.

Born into a wealthy family of coffee plantation owners, he was sent to study medicine in Aberdeen, where he graduated as a surgeon. Montealegre was the first Costa Rican to be sent to study medicine in Europe. He married twice: in 1840 to Ana Maria Mora (1819–1854), sister of the previous President Juan Rafael Mora (1849–1859), and in 1858 to Sofía Matilde Joy Redman (1823–1908), a Londoner, who was a relative of British diplomat Sir William Gore Ouseley.

He came to power following a military coup d&#x27;état against Juan Rafael Mora. In the first months of his presidency he convened a constitutional conventional, which produced the Constitution of 1859.

Under the new constitution he was popularly elected to a three-year presidential term in 1860, after which he handed on the presidency, peacefully and democratically, to Jesús Jiménez.

He suffered a political setback when a coup led by Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez deposed his brother-in-law, Bruno Carranza. Montealegre decided to leave Costa Rica, and sailed with his family on the steamer Alaska to San Francisco in 1872. He died in San Jose, California and his mortal remains laid near Mission San Jose (located in what is now Fremont, California) until they were repatriated in 1978.

His sister was Gerónima Montealegre, and his great-great-grandniece is actress Madeleine Stowe.

<text>Kattassery Joseph Yesudas (; born 10 January 1940) is an Indian playback singer and musician who sings Indian classical, devotional and film songs. He is widely considered one of the greatest singers in the history of Indian music and a cultural icon of Kerala. Yesudas is estimated to have recorded more than 50,000 songs in various Indian languages, including Malayalam, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Tulu, Hindi, Odia, Bengali, Marathi as well as Arabic, English, Latin, and Russian, in a career spanning six decades. He is often referred to as Gaanagandharvan ( The Celestial Singer). Yesudas holds the record for singing 11 songs in different languages in a single day. He has also composed a number of Malayalam film songs during the 1970s and 1980s.

Yesudas won the National Award for the Best Male Playback Singer eight times (the highest of any person), the Filmfare Awards South five times, and the State Award for the Best Playback Singer forty-three times, including awards given by the state governments of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and West Bengal. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1975, the Padma Bhushan in 2002, and the Padma Vibhushan (second-highest civilian award) in 2017 by the Government of India for his contributions towards the arts. In 2005, he was honoured with the J. C. Daniel Award, Kerala government&#x27;s highest honour for contributions to Malayalam cinema. In 2011 Yesudas was honoured with the CNN-IBN outstanding achievement award for his contributions in the music field. In 2006, he sang 16 film songs in four South Indian languages on the same day at AVM Studio, Chennai.

==Early life==
K. J. Yesudas was born in Kochi, in Kerala, to Augustine Joseph and Elizabeth Joseph. His father was a well-known Malayalam classical musician and stage actor. Yesudas was the second of seven children, preceded by an elder sister named Pushpa, and followed by four younger brothers - Antony (Antappan), Babu, Mani, Justin and a younger sister, Jayamma. Among these siblings, Pushpa and Babu died of fever at a young age, and Justin, the youngest brother, died under mysterious circumstances in February 2020, aged 62.

Augustine Joseph&#x27;s dearest friend, Musician Kunjan Velu Bhagavathar was the first guru of him. Kunjan Velu was the disciple of Nadaswara Chakravarthi T. N. Rajarathnam Pillai. Yesudas started his academic music training at R. L. V. Music Academy, Thrippunithura and completed the &quot;Ganabooshanam&quot; course. Later he studied at Swathi Thirunal College of Music, Thiruvananthapuram under the tutelage of the carnatic music maestro K. R. Kumaraswamy Iyer and Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer but could not complete his studies due to financial constraints. For a brief period, he also studied music under Vechoor Harihara Subramania Iyer, after which he took advanced training from Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar.

K. J. Yesudas married Prabha Yesudas on 1 February 1970 in Mallapally.

In 2021, Yesudas completed 60 years as a playback singer.

==Career==

===Debut and early career: 1960s===

Yesudas recorded his first popular song &quot;Jaathi Bhedam Matha Dwesham&quot; (music: M. B. Sreenivasan) on 14 November 1961. The singer considers those four lines he got to sing to start his career in films as a huge blessing as it was written by none other than Sree Narayana Guru, the most respected saint-poet-social reformer of Kerala. The film was Kalpadukal (1962), based on social reform during the life and times of Sree Narayana Guru. He associated with popular singers of those times like P. Leela, Santha P. Nair, K. P. Udayabhanu, S. Janaki etc. and lyricists like P. Bhaskaran and Nambiyath. He sang the lines of poet Kumaran Asan for this film. 
After the initial years he became the most sought after by established music directors of that time, M. B. Sreenivasan, G. Devarajan, V. Dakshinamoorthy, Br Lakshmanan, M. S. Baburaj and many others. Thus began his career in playback singing which included the Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada movies thereafter.

He got the first major break with the hit Malayalam film named &quot;Bharya&quot; ( music by G. Devarajan and lyrics by Vayalar Ramavarma). In 1967, he sang hit songs in the composition of M.S.Baburaj for the film &quot;Udhyogastha&quot; directed by P.Venu. He also sang in Tamil for &quot;Bommai&quot; first (music: S. Balachander), but the first released movie was &quot;Konjum Kumari&quot; (music: Veda). In 1965, he was invited by the Soviet Union government to perform at music concerts in various cities in the USSR and also sang a Russian song over Radio Kazakhstan. The trio of Salil, Yesudas and Prem Nazir entered the Malayalam Cinema Industry of the 1970s.

In 1970 he was nominated to head the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Academy and was the youngest person ever to occupy the post.

===Bollywood: 1970s===
After a decade of singing in South Indian movies, Yesudas got a break in Bollywood in the early 1970s. The first Hindi song he sang was for the movie &quot;Jai Jawan Jai Kissan&quot; (1971), but the first released movie was &quot;Chhoti Si Baat&quot;, which resulted in his becoming popular for singings songs like &quot;Jaaneman Jaaneman&quot;. He has sung Hindi songs for many leading actors in Hindi cinema including Amitabh Bachchan, Amol Palekar and Jeetendra. He has sung many evergreen Hindi film songs for music directors including Ravindra Jain, Bappi Lahiri, Khayyam, Raj Kamal and Salil Chowdhury.

Yesudas&#x27; most popular Hindi songs are in the 1976 movie &quot;Chitchor&quot;, with music given by Ravindra Jain.

On 14 November 1999, Yesudas was presented with an honorary award by UNESCO for &quot;Outstanding Achievements in Music and Peace&quot; at the &quot;Music for Peace&quot; event in Paris, a concert held to mark the dawn of the new millennium and whose attendees included artistes such as Lionel Richie, Ray Charles, Montserrat Caballé, and Zubin Mehta.

In 2001 he sang for album &quot;Ahimsa&quot; in Sanskrit, Latin and English and in a mix of styles including new-age and Carnatic. In his music concerts in the Middle East he sings Arabic songs in the Carnatic style. He frequently serves as a cultural ambassador for India through his performances abroad, promoting Indian music.

In 2009 Yesudas began a cross-country musical campaign against terrorism in Thiruvananthapuram, with the motto &#x27;Music For Peace&#x27;. Kavita Karkare, wife of Hemant Karkare, handed over the torch to Yesudas to mark the launch of the &#x27;Shanthi Sangeetha Yatra&#x27;. Yesudas has performed for 36 times in the 36-year-old Soorya Music festival organised by Soorya Krishnamoorthy.

==Personal life==
Yesudas is married to Prabha since 1 February 1970. They have three sons, Vinod (b. 1977), Vijay (b. 1979) and Vishal (b. 1981). Their second son, Vijay, is a musician who won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer in 2007, 2012 and 2018.
Sree Narayana Guru&#x27;s message, &quot;One religion and One God for all humanity&quot;, influenced young Yesudas in his dealings with his fellow men. He had his own heroes among the musicians too. Mohammed Rafi, Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar and Balamurali Krishna are the ones he admires the most.
Yesudas has been visiting Kollur Mookambika temple, Kollur, Karnataka on his birthday to sing keerthans of Saraswati devi, the Goddess of knowledge, music and the arts. The music festival started on his 60th birthday in 2000. The nine-day music festival begins every January at Kollur Mookambika Temple.

On Sunday, 10 January 2010, he celebrated his 70th birthday (Sapthathi) at Kollur Sri Mookambika Temple with &#x27;Sangeetharchana&#x27; (classical devotional songs), along with 70 singers before goddess Mookambika. The Sangeetharchana included &quot;Pancharatna Gayana&quot; of Thyagaraja&#x27;s poems. He also took part in the Vidyarambha function. All India Radio broadcast the special Sangeetharchana all over Kerala. Yesudas also has many songs devoted to Lord Ayyappa including the hit song &quot;Harivarasanam&quot;. In 2002, during Marad massacre, he visited the place along with the veteran poet Sugathakumari, and conducted classes against violence. Harivarasanam, a devotional song musical version composed by G. Devarajan, recited before closing the temple at Sabarimala was sung by Yesudas. Though there have been many different renditions of this song by many different renowned singers, Sabarimala officially uses Yesudas&#x27; voice for Harivarasanam every day.

==Music company and school==
In 1980 Yesudas established the Tharangini Studio at Thiruvananthapuram. In 1992 the office and studio were moved to Chennai and the company was incorporated in the USA in 1998. Tharangni Studio and Tharangni Records became a recording center in Kerala which, for the first time, brought out audio cassettes of Malayalam film songs in stereo. The record company also had a voice mixing studio in Studio27, Chennai. The studio continues to produce and present events of Yesudas, both for film and Indian classical music concerts throughout the world.

Yesudas founded Tharanganisari School of Music in 1975 to train students in various branches of music. The school is recognized by Government of Kerala. It is managed by a society which is registered under the Travancore-Cochin Literary, Scientific and Charitable Societies Act 12 of 1955. It is situated at Edappazhanji, Thiruvananthapuram. A music appreciation class will be held on the second saturday of every month at the school. The class is free for all and is open to public of all ages. Composer Perumbavoor G. Raveendranath worked as a music teacher in 1976. Some of the notable alumnus of the school are composers Mohan Sithara, Murali Sithara and guitarist John Antony.

==Awards and honours==

Yesudas presents the awards at a &quot;Gandharva Sandhya&quot; every January.

== Admiration ==
In his acceptance speech of winning the Swaralaya Kairali Yesudas Award (2006), AR Rahman said &quot;I&#x27;m greatly honoured by Swaralaya&#x27;s gesture, and getting this award from my most favourite singer Mr Yesudas. He is one of my most favourite voices&#x27; ever in the world.&quot; On another occasion during an interview he said of Yesudas, &quot;his voice is unmatched, his voice is god given and I&#x27;ve been hearing his songs since I was 3 years old.&quot;

Ravindra Jain, in an interview wherein the blind music director confessed that if ever he happened to regain vision, the first person he would like to see would be Yesudas.

In 2003, billionaire and businessman B. R. Shetty gifted him his 1992 model Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit after listening his concert held at The Indian High School, Dubai. Shetty said: &quot;I was not only touched by his concert but by the man himself who talked about God&#x27;s kindness to mankind&quot;.

Bappi Lahiri said in an interview with Filmfare in 2012: &quot;&#x27;Yesudas&#x27; voice is touched by God. After Kishore Da(Kishore Kumar), he was another singer who brought out the best in me. He is a yogi, a mystic who lives for music. He takes your tunes to another level. And his note is perfect, you can rely on him to deliver it right the first time. Working with him made me touch base with my melodious side. He is vastly under-utilised in Hindi films. I wish Hindi film composers of today realise his genius and offer him assignments.&quot;

<doc id="454450" wikidata="Q833065" url="?curid=454450" title="Analytical mechanics">
<text>In theoretical physics and mathematical physics, analytical mechanics, or theoretical mechanics is a collection of closely related formulations of classical mechanics. Analytical mechanics uses &quot;scalar&quot; properties of motion representing the system as a whole—usually its kinetic energy and potential energy. The equations of motion are derived from the scalar quantity by some underlying principle about the scalar&#x27;s variation. 

Analytical mechanics was developed by many scientists and mathematicians during the 18th century and onward, after Newtonian mechanics. Newtonian mechanics considers vector quantities of motion, particularly accelerations, momenta, forces, of the constituents of the system; it can also be called &quot;vectorial mechanics&quot;. A scalar is a quantity, whereas a vector is represented by quantity and direction. The results of these two different approaches are equivalent, but the analytical mechanics approach has many advantages for complex problems.

Analytical mechanics takes advantage of a system&#x27;s &quot;constraints&quot; to solve problems. The constraints limit the degrees of freedom the system can have, and can be used to reduce the number of coordinates needed to solve for the motion. The formalism is well suited to arbitrary choices of coordinates, known in the context as generalized coordinates. The kinetic and potential energies of the system are expressed using these generalized coordinates or momenta, and the equations of motion can be readily set up, thus analytical mechanics allows numerous mechanical problems to be solved with greater efficiency than fully vectorial methods. It does not always work for non-conservative forces or dissipative forces like friction, in which case one may revert to Newtonian mechanics.

Two dominant branches of analytical mechanics are Lagrangian mechanics (using generalized coordinates and corresponding generalized velocities in configuration space) and Hamiltonian mechanics (using coordinates and corresponding momenta in phase space). Both formulations are equivalent by a Legendre transformation on the generalized coordinates, velocities and momenta; therefore, both contain the same information for describing the dynamics of a system. There are other formulations such as Hamilton–Jacobi theory, Routhian mechanics, and Appell&#x27;s equation of motion. All equations of motion for particles and fields, in any formalism, can be derived from the widely applicable result called the principle of least action. One result is Noether&#x27;s theorem, a statement which connects conservation laws to their associated symmetries.

Analytical mechanics does not introduce new physics and is not more general than Newtonian mechanics. Rather it is a collection of equivalent formalisms which have broad application. In fact the same principles and formalisms can be used in relativistic mechanics and general relativity, and with some modifications, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.

Analytical mechanics is used widely, from fundamental physics to applied mathematics, particularly chaos theory.

The methods of analytical mechanics apply to discrete particles, each with a finite number of degrees of freedom. They can be modified to describe continuous fields or fluids, which have infinite degrees of freedom. The definitions and equations have a close analogy with those of mechanics.

==Motivation==
The goal of mechanical theory is to solve mechanical problems, such as arise in physics and engineering. Starting from a physical system—such as a mechanism or a star system—a mathematical model is developed in the form of a differential equation. The model can be solved numerically or analytically to determine the motion of the system.

Newton&#x27;s vectorial approach to mechanics describes motion with the help of vector quantities such as force, velocity, acceleration. These quantities characterise the motion of a body idealised as a &quot;mass point&quot; or a &quot;particle&quot; understood as a single point to which a mass is attached. Newton&#x27;s method has been successfully applied to a wide range of physical problems, including the motion of a particle in Earth&#x27;s gravitational field and the motion of planets around the Sun. In this approach, Newton&#x27;s laws describe the motion by a differential equation and then the problem is reduced to the solving of that equation.

When a mechanical system contains many particles, however (such as a complex mechanism or a fluid), Newton&#x27;s approach is difficult to apply. Using a Newtonian approach is possible, under proper precautions, namely isolating each single particle from the others, and determining all the forces acting on it. Such analysis is cumbersome even in relatively simple systems. Newton thought that his third law &quot;action equals reaction&quot; would take care of all complications. This is false even for such simple system as rotations of a solid body. In more complicated systems, the vectorial approach cannot give an adequate description.

The analytical approach simplifies problems by treating mechanical systems as ensembles of particles that interact with each other, rather considering each particle as an isolated unit. In the vectorial approach, forces must be determined individually for each particle, whereas in the analytical approach it is enough to know one single function which contains implicitly all the forces acting on and in the system. 
Such simplification is often done using certain kinematic conditions which are stated &quot;a priori&quot;. However, the analytical treatment does not require the knowledge of these forces and takes these kinematic conditions for granted.

Still, deriving the equations of motion of a complicated mechanical system requires a unifying basis from which they follow. This is provided by various variational principles: behind each set of equations there is a principle that expresses the meaning of the entire set. Given a fundamental and universal quantity called &quot;action&quot;, the principle that this action be stationary under small variation of some other mechanical quantity generates the required set of differential equations. The statement of the principle does not require any special coordinate system, and all results are expressed in generalized coordinates. This means that the analytical equations of motion do not change upon a coordinate transformation, an invariance property that is lacking in the vectorial equations of motion.

It is not altogether clear what is meant by &#x27;solving&#x27; a set of differential equations. A problem is regarded as solved when the particles coordinates at time &quot;t&quot; are expressed as simple functions of &quot;t&quot; and of parameters defining the initial positions and velocities. However, &#x27;simple function&#x27; is not a well-defined concept: nowadays, a function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is not regarded as a formal expression in &quot;t&quot; (elementary function) as in the time of Newton but most generally as a quantity determined by &quot;t&quot;, and it is not possible to draw a sharp line between &#x27;simple&#x27; and &#x27;not simple&#x27; functions. If one speaks merely of &#x27;functions&#x27;, then every mechanical problem is solved as soon as it has been well stated in differential equations, because given the initial conditions and &quot;t&quot; determine the coordinates at &quot;t&quot;. This is a fact especially at present with the modern methods of computer modelling which provide arithmetical solutions to mechanical problems to any desired degree of accuracy, the differential equations being replaced by difference equations.

Still, though lacking precise definitions, it is obvious that the two-body problem has a simple solution, whereas the three-body problem has not. The two-body problem is solved by formulas involving parameters; their values can be changed to study the class of all solutions, that is, the mathematical structure of the problem. Moreover, an accurate mental or drawn picture can be made for the motion of two bodies, and it can be as real and accurate as the real bodies moving and interacting. In the three-body problem, parameters can also be assigned specific values; however, the solution at these assigned values or a collection of such solutions does not reveal the mathematical structure of the problem. As in many other problems, the mathematical structure can be elucidated only by examining the differential equations themselves.

Analytical mechanics aims at even more: not at understanding the mathematical structure of a single mechanical problem, but that of a class of problems so wide that they encompass most of mechanics. It concentrates on systems to which Lagrangian or Hamiltonian equations of motion are applicable and that include a very wide range of problems indeed.

Development of analytical mechanics has two objectives: (i) increase the range of solvable problems by developing standard techniques with a wide range of applicability, and (ii) understand the mathematical structure of mechanics. In the long run, however, (ii) can help (i) more than a concentration on specific problems for which methods have already been designed.

==Intrinsic motion==
===Generalized coordinates and constraints===

In Newtonian mechanics, one customarily uses all three Cartesian coordinates, or other 3D coordinate system, to refer to a body&#x27;s position during its motion. In physical systems, however, some structure or other system usually constrains the body&#x27;s motion from taking certain directions and pathways. So a full set of Cartesian coordinates is often unneeded, as the constraints determine the evolving relations among the coordinates, which relations can be modeled by equations corresponding to the constraints. In the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, the constraints are incorporated into the motion&#x27;s geometry, reducing the number of coordinates to the minimum needed to model the motion. These are known as &quot;generalized coordinates&quot;, denoted &quot;qi&quot; (&quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, 3...).

===Difference between curvillinear and generalized coordinates===
Generalized coordinates incorporate constraints on the system. There is one generalized coordinate &quot;qi&quot; for each degree of freedom (for convenience labelled by an index &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2...&quot;N&quot;), i.e. each way the system can change its configuration; as curvilinear lengths or angles of rotation. Generalized coordinates are not the same as curvilinear coordinates. The number of &quot;curvilinear&quot; coordinates equals the dimension of the position space in question (usually 3 for 3d space), while the number of &quot;generalized&quot; coordinates is not necessarily equal to this dimension; constraints can reduce the number of degrees of freedom (hence the number of generalized coordinates required to define the configuration of the system), following the general rule:


For a system with &quot;N&quot; degrees of freedom, the generalized coordinates can be collected into an &quot;N&quot;-tuple:
formula_1
and the time derivative (here denoted by an overdot) of this tuple give the &quot;generalized velocities&quot;:
formula_2

===D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle of virtual work===

D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle states that infinitesimal &quot;virtual work&quot; done by a force across reversible displacements is zero, which is the work done by a force consistent with ideal constraints of the system. The idea of a constraint is useful – since this limits what the system can do, and can provide steps to solving for the motion of the system. The equation for D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle is:
formula_3
where formula_4
are the generalized forces (script Q instead of ordinary Q is used here to prevent conflict with canonical transformations below) and are the generalized coordinates. This leads to the generalized form of Newton&#x27;s laws in the language of analytical mechanics:
formula_5

where &quot;T&quot; is the total kinetic energy of the system, and the notation
formula_6
is a useful shorthand (see matrix calculus for this notation).

===Constraints===

If the curvilinear coordinate system is defined by the standard position vector , and if the position vector can be written in terms of the generalized coordinates and time in the form: formula_7 and this relation holds for all times , then are called &quot;holonomic constraints&quot;. Vector is explicitly dependent on in cases when the constraints vary with time, not just because of . For time-independent situations, the constraints are also called scleronomic, for time-dependent cases they are called rheonomic.

==Lagrangian mechanics==
The introduction of generalized coordinates and the fundamental Lagrangian function:

:formula_8

where &quot;T&quot; is the total kinetic energy and &quot;V&quot; is the total potential energy of the entire system, then either following the calculus of variations or using the above formula – lead to the Euler–Lagrange equations;

:formula_9

which are a set of &quot;N&quot; second-order ordinary differential equations, one for each &quot;qi&quot;(&quot;t&quot;).

This formulation identifies the actual path followed by the motion as a selection of the path over which the time integral of kinetic energy is least, assuming the total energy to be fixed, and imposing no conditions on the time of transit.

The Lagrangian formulation uses the configuration space of the system, the set of all possible generalized coordinates:

:formula_10

where formula_11 is &quot;N&quot;-dimensional real space (see also set-builder notation). The particular solution to the Euler–Lagrange equations is called a &quot;(configuration) path or trajectory&quot;, i.e. one particular q(&quot;t&quot;) subject to the required initial conditions. The general solutions form a set of possible configurations as functions of time:

:formula_12

The configuration space can be defined more generally, and indeed more deeply, in terms of topological manifolds and the tangent bundle.

==Hamiltonian mechanics==
The Legendre transformation of the Lagrangian replaces the generalized coordinates and velocities (q, q̇) with (q, p); the generalized coordinates and the &quot;generalized momenta&quot; conjugate to the generalized coordinates:

:formula_13

and introduces the Hamiltonian (which is in terms of generalized coordinates and momenta):

:formula_14

where formula_15 denotes the dot product, also leading to Hamilton&#x27;s equations:

:formula_16

which are now a set of 2&quot;N&quot; first-order ordinary differential equations, one for each &quot;qi&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) and &quot;pi&quot;(&quot;t&quot;). Another result from the Legendre transformation relates the time derivatives of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian:

:formula_17

which is often considered one of Hamilton&#x27;s equations of motion additionally to the others. The generalized momenta can be written in terms of the generalized forces in the same way as Newton&#x27;s second law:

:formula_18

Analogous to the configuration space, the set of all momenta is the generalized momentum space:

:formula_19

(&quot;Momentum space&quot; also refers to &quot;k-space&quot;; the set of all wave vectors (given by De Broglie relations) as used in quantum mechanics and theory of waves)

The set of all positions and momenta form the phase space:

:formula_20

that is, the Cartesian product of the configuration space and generalized momentum space.

A particular solution to Hamilton&#x27;s equations is called a &quot;phase path&quot;, a particular curve (q(&quot;t&quot;),p(&quot;t&quot;)) subject to the required initial conditions. The set of all phase paths, the general solution to the differential equations, is the &quot;phase portrait&quot;:

:formula_21

===The Poisson bracket===
All dynamical variables can be derived from position q, momentum p, and time &quot;t&quot;, and written as a function of these: &quot;A&quot; = &quot;A&quot;(q, p, &quot;t&quot;). If &quot;A&quot;(q, p, &quot;t&quot;) and &quot;B&quot;(q, p, &quot;t&quot;) are two scalar valued dynamical variables, the &quot;Poisson bracket&quot; is defined by the generalized coordinates and momenta:

:formula_22

Calculating the total derivative of one of these, say &quot;A&quot;, and substituting Hamilton&#x27;s equations into the result leads to the time evolution of &quot;A&quot;:

:formula_23

This equation in &quot;A&quot; is closely related to the equation of motion in the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics, in which classical dynamical variables become quantum operators (indicated by hats (^)), and the Poisson bracket is replaced by the commutator of operators via Dirac&#x27;s canonical quantization:

:formula_24

==Properties of the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian==
Following are overlapping properties between the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions.
* All the individual generalized coordinates &quot;qi&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), velocities &quot;q̇i&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) and momenta &quot;pi&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) for every degree of freedom are mutually independent. Explicit time-dependence of a function means the function actually includes time &quot;t&quot; as a variable in addition to the q(&quot;t&quot;), p(&quot;t&quot;), not simply as a parameter through q(&quot;t&quot;) and p(&quot;t&quot;), which would mean explicit time-independence.
* The Lagrangian is invariant under addition of the &quot;total&quot; time derivative of any function of q and &quot;t&quot;, that is: formula_25 so each Lagrangian &quot;L&quot; and &quot;L&quot;&#x27; describe &quot;exactly the same motion&quot;. In other words, the Lagrangian of a system is not unique.
* Analogously, the Hamiltonian is invariant under addition of the &quot;partial&quot; time derivative of any function of q, p and &quot;t&quot;, that is: formula_26 (&quot;K&quot; is a frequently used letter in this case). This property is used in canonical transformations (see below).
*If the Lagrangian is independent of some generalized coordinates, then the generalized momenta conjugate to those coordinates are constants of the motion, i.e. are conserved, this immediately follows from Lagrange&#x27;s equations: formula_27 Such coordinates are &quot;cyclic&quot; or &quot;ignorable&quot;. It can be shown that the Hamiltonian is also cyclic in exactly the same generalized coordinates.
*If the Lagrangian is time-independent the Hamiltonian is also time-independent (i.e. both are constant in time).
*If the kinetic energy is a homogeneous function of degree 2 of the generalized velocities, &quot;and&quot; the Lagrangian is explicitly time-independent, then: formula_28 where &quot;λ&quot; is a constant, then the Hamiltonian will be the &quot;total conserved energy&quot;, equal to the total kinetic and potential energies of the system: formula_29 This is the basis for the Schrödinger equation, inserting quantum operators directly obtains it.

==Principle of least action==
Action is another quantity in analytical mechanics defined as a functional of the Lagrangian:

:formula_30

A general way to find the equations of motion from the action is the &quot;principle of least action&quot;:

:formula_31

where the departure &quot;t&quot;1 and arrival &quot;t&quot;2 times are fixed. The term &quot;path&quot; or &quot;trajectory&quot; refers to the time evolution of the system as a path through configuration space formula_32, in other words q(&quot;t&quot;) tracing out a path in formula_32. The path for which action is least is the path taken by the system.

From this principle, &quot;all&quot; equations of motion in classical mechanics can be derived. This approach can be extended to fields rather than a system of particles (see below), and underlies the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, and is used for calculating geodesic motion in general relativity.

==Hamiltonian-Jacobi mechanics==
;Canonical transformations

The invariance of the Hamiltonian (under addition of the partial time derivative of an arbitrary function of p, q, and &quot;t&quot;) allows the Hamiltonian in one set of coordinates q and momenta p to be transformed into a new set Q = Q(q, p, &quot;t&quot;) and P = P(q, p, &quot;t&quot;), in four possible ways:

:formula_34

With the restriction on P and Q such that the transformed Hamiltonian system is:

:formula_35

the above transformations are called &quot;canonical transformations&quot;, each function &quot;Gn&quot; is called a generating function of the &quot;&quot;n&quot;th kind&quot; or &quot;type-&quot;n&quot;&quot;. The transformation of coordinates and momenta can allow simplification for solving Hamilton&#x27;s equations for a given problem.

The choice of Q and P is completely arbitrary, but not every choice leads to a canonical transformation. One simple criterion for a transformation q → Q and p → P to be canonical is the Poisson bracket be unity,

:formula_36

for all &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2...&quot;N&quot;. If this does not hold then the transformation is not canonical.

;The Hamilton–Jacobi equation

By setting the canonically transformed Hamiltonian &quot;K&quot; = 0, and the type-2 generating function equal to Hamilton&#x27;s principal function (also the action formula_37) plus an arbitrary constant &quot;C&quot;:

:formula_38

the generalized momenta become:

:formula_39

and P is constant, then the Hamiltonian-Jacobi equation (HJE) can be derived from the type-2 canonical transformation:

:formula_40

where &quot;H&quot; is the Hamiltonian as before:

:formula_41

Another related function is Hamilton&#x27;s characteristic function

:formula_42

used to solve the HJE by additive separation of variables for a time-independent Hamiltonian &quot;H&quot;.

The study of the solutions of the Hamilton–Jacobi equations leads naturally to the study of symplectic manifolds and symplectic topology. In this formulation, the solutions of the Hamilton–Jacobi equations are the integral curves of Hamiltonian vector fields.

==Routhian mechanics==

Routhian mechanics is a hybrid formulation of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, not often used but especially useful for removing cyclic coordinates. If the Lagrangian of a system has &quot;s&quot; cyclic coordinates q = &quot;q&quot;1, &quot;q&quot;2, ... &quot;qs&quot; with conjugate momenta p = &quot;p&quot;1, &quot;p&quot;2, ... &quot;ps&quot;, with the rest of the coordinates non-cyclic and denoted ζ = &quot;ζ&quot;1, &quot;ζ&quot;1, ..., &quot;ζN − s&quot;, they can be removed by introducing the &quot;Routhian&quot;:

:formula_43

which leads to a set of 2&quot;s&quot; Hamiltonian equations for the cyclic coordinates q,

:formula_44

and &quot;N&quot; − &quot;s&quot; Lagrangian equations in the non cyclic coordinates ζ.

:formula_45

Set up in this way, although the Routhian has the form of the Hamiltonian, it can be thought of a Lagrangian with &quot;N&quot; − &quot;s&quot; degrees of freedom.

The coordinates q do not have to be cyclic, the partition between which coordinates enter the Hamiltonian equations and those which enter the Lagrangian equations is arbitrary. It is simply convenient to let the Hamiltonian equations remove the cyclic coordinates, leaving the non cyclic coordinates to the Lagrangian equations of motion.

==Appellian mechanics==

Appell&#x27;s equation of motion involve generalized accelerations, the second time derivatives of the generalized coordinates:

:formula_46

as well as generalized forces mentioned above in D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle. The equations are

:formula_47

where

:formula_48

is the acceleration of the &quot;k&quot; particle, the second time derivative of its position vector. Each acceleration a&quot;k&quot; is expressed in terms of the generalized accelerations &quot;αr&quot;, likewise each rk are expressed in terms the generalized coordinates &quot;qr&quot;.

==Classical field theory==
===Lagrangian field theory===

Generalized coordinates apply to discrete particles. For &quot;N&quot; scalar fields &quot;φi&quot;(r, &quot;t&quot;) where &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, ... &quot;N&quot;, the Lagrangian density is a function of these fields and their space and time derivatives, and possibly the space and time coordinates themselves:
formula_49
and the Euler–Lagrange equations have an analogue for fields:
formula_50
where &quot;∂μ&quot; denotes the 4-gradient and the summation convention has been used. For &quot;N&quot; scalar fields, these Lagrangian field equations are a set of &quot;N&quot; second order partial differential equations in the fields, which in general will be coupled and nonlinear.

This scalar field formulation can be extended to vector fields, tensor fields, and spinor fields.

The Lagrangian is the volume integral of the Lagrangian density:
formula_51

Originally developed for classical fields, the above formulation is applicable to all physical fields in classical, quantum, and relativistic situations: such as Newtonian gravity, classical electromagnetism, general relativity, and quantum field theory. It is a question of determining the correct Lagrangian density to generate the correct field equation.

===Hamiltonian field theory===

The corresponding &quot;momentum&quot; field densities conjugate to the &quot;N&quot; scalar fields &quot;φi&quot;(r, &quot;t&quot;) are:
formula_52
where in this context the overdot denotes a partial time derivative, not a total time derivative. The Hamiltonian density formula_53 is defined by analogy with mechanics:
formula_54

The equations of motion are:
formula_55
where the variational derivative
formula_56
must be used instead of merely partial derivatives. For &quot;N&quot; fields, these Hamiltonian field equations are a set of 2&quot;N&quot; first order partial differential equations, which in general will be coupled and nonlinear.

Again, the volume integral of the Hamiltonian density is the Hamiltonian
formula_57

==Symmetry, conservation, and Noether&#x27;s theorem==
;Symmetry transformations in classical space and time

Each transformation can be described by an operator (i.e. function acting on the position r or momentum p variables to change them). The following are the cases when the operator does not change r or p, i.e. symmetries.
where &quot;R&quot;(n̂, θ) is the rotation matrix about an axis defined by the unit vector n̂ and angle θ.

;Noether&#x27;s theorem

Noether&#x27;s theorem states that a continuous symmetry transformation of the action corresponds to a conservation law, i.e. the action (and hence the Lagrangian) does not change under a transformation parameterized by a parameter &quot;s&quot;:
formula_58
the Lagrangian describes the same motion independent of &quot;s&quot;, which can be length, angle of rotation, or time. The corresponding momenta to &quot;q&quot; will be conserved.

<text>The Canberra Raiders are an Australian professional rugby league football club based in the national capital city of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. They have competed in Australasia&#x27;s elite rugby league competition, the National Rugby League (NRL) premiership since 1982. Over this period the club has won three premierships out of six Grand Finals, the last one played being the 2019 NRL Grand Final, resulting in a 14-8 controversial loss to the Sydney Roosters. Canberra currently have the second longest active premiership drought in the NRL totalling 30 years. The Raiders&#x27; current home ground is Canberra Stadium in Bruce. Previously, the team played home matches at Seiffert Oval in Queanbeyan, New South Wales, with the move to the Canberra Stadium in Bruce taking place in 1990. The official symbol for the Canberra Raiders is the Viking. The Viking, also a mascot at Raiders&#x27; games, is known as Victor the Viking.

As part of the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership&#x27;s first expansion outside Sydney, the Raiders were admitted to the League, along with the Illawarra Steelers in the 1982 season. Over the following years they improved steadily, reaching a playoff for 5th in their third season, and becoming the first non-Sydney team to make the finals (1987), after this they would go on to feature in a grand final (1987) and win a premiership (1989). This heralded a period of great success for the club, with five grand Final appearances and three premierships in eight years. During this period, the Raiders boasted international players such as Mal Meninga, Laurie Daley, Ricky Stuart, Glenn Lazarus, Bradley Clyde, Gary Belcher, Brett Mullins and Steve Walters. After this came the Super League war, with the Raiders switching to the rebel competition before continuing to compete in the re-unified NRL. During the 2000s the Raiders suffered from an exodus of experience. At the beginning of the 2009 season, the Raiders squad contained only four players who have played at the representative level. Joel Monaghan and Terry Campese each represented the Australian side during the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, with Monaghan also playing for the NSW blues during the third game of the 2008 State of Origin series.

==History==

At the beginning of the 1980s, the New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL) was looking to expand its Sydney-based premiership into other areas of the state. The Queanbeyan Blues rugby league team who was coached by Colin O&#x27;Rourke at the time was selected to form the Canberra franchise. The Canberra franchise was accepted in 1981 as the 14th team for the 1982 NSWRFL season. Along with the Illawarra Steelers who were also introduced that season, they became the first NSWRFL club based outside Sydney since the old Newcastle team left in 1909.

===1980s===
The club&#x27;s initial seasons were a mixed bag, with the team earning the wooden spoon in their debut year. The team was notorious for late game collapses, leading to the nicknames &quot;Canberra Faders&quot; and &quot;Pine Lime Splices&quot;, in what was also a reference to the team&#x27;s colours. In fact, no team has conceded more tries in a season than the 1982 Raiders. The first points recorded by the Raiders were scored by Peter McGrath, who went on to score 41 points in his first and only season with the Raiders. The club&#x27;s first win, a 12–11 heartstopper v Newtown, came in its 8th match, and 3 more wins followed, most notably against then competition leaders Souths. 1983 saw 9 wins, more than doubling 1982&#x27;s four. However, the team continued to struggle to win away from home. An away win first up in 1984 foreshadowed a much improved season, a positive winning record (13–11) snagging a playoff for fifth versus Souths. But this game was lost (4–23), and the Raiders had still not succeeded in reaching the semi-finals of the competition.

1985 saw regression, with the team winning only 8 games (though the reserves did reach the Grand Final). Though 1986 was similarly disappointing, the team had a core group of players, such as Queensland trio Mal Meninga, Gary Belcher, Steve Walters, and John Ferguson who would greatly influence the coming decade.

This was the most successful period in the Raiders&#x27; short history, with 5 Grand Finals and 3 premierships. In 1987, the team finished third after the minor rounds, resulting in a maiden semi-finals appearance. Despite going down 25–16 in their first finals match against Eastern Suburbs, the Raiders rallied to defeat South Sydney (46–12) and Easts again (32–24) in the Preliminary Final. The latter earned the team a place in the Grand Final, but they were never really competitive against minor premiers Manly-Warringah, going down 18–8 in what was the last Grand Final to be played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The GF attracted a then Raiders all-time record attendance of 50,201 which would stand until 2019. Laurie Daley, Peter Jackson and Glenn Lazarus all made their debut for Canberra in 1987, though only Queensland State of Origin Jackson played a prominent role that year, more so after his centre partner Meninga broke his arm and missed half of the season.

1988 featured free-scoring (over 100 tries in 22 games) and a number of large victories, with the team again finishing in third place on the ladder. Unfortunately, a narrow 19–18 loss against eventual premiers Canterbury-Bankstown in the Major Semi-final was followed by defeat against the Balmain Tigers and an early exit. After the debuts of Daley, Jackson and Lazarus in 1987, 1988 saw the debuts of future internationals Bradley Clyde, and former Wallaby scrum half, Queanbeyan born Ricky Stuart.

With 5 rounds to play in the 1989 season, Canberra were 7th and in danger of missing the semis. But a hard-fought 14–10 win over Easts started a 9 match winning streak, culminating in the club&#x27;s first Premiership. Throughout the finals, Canberra was forced to walk the sudden-death tightrope after sneaking into the finals in fourth place. They easily accounted for Cronulla 31–10 in the Qualifying final, before defeating the emerging Penrith Panthers 27–18 in the semis. Then the Preliminary final, the Raiders defeated the minor premiers South Sydney 32–16 to qualify for their second Grand Final appearance in three seasons.

In one of the all-time great Grand Finals against Balmain, the Raiders sent the game into extra time after a late John Ferguson try that was converted by Meninga. Reserve forward Steve Jackson then scored the winning try to win the premiership for the Raiders in extra time after crashing through 4 Tigers defenders. Following the Grand Final win, the Raiders then went on to play in England at Old Trafford in the official World Club Challenge against Stones Bitter Championship winners Widnes. Widnes however, with their main strike weapon, Great Britain winger and the fastest player in rugby league at the time, Martin Offiah, in top form, defeated Canberra 30–18 in front of 30,768 fans.

Fullback Gary Belcher became the first Raider to be the NSWRL&#x27;s leading point scorer in 1988 with 218 points (10 tries and 89 goals). 1989 also saw the Australian and Queensland fullback become the first Raider to lead the league in try scoring when he crossed for 17 tries. Belcher was also the first ever fullback to lead the try scoring list in a season.

===1990s===
1990 was a stellar year for the club at all levels. All three grades making the Grand Final, with only the reserves losing. The first grade side earned their first Minor Premiership and a second consecutive title, defeating Penrith in the decider. Trouble brewed in 1991 as the club was embroiled in salary cap hardships. Nonetheless, a fourth Grand Final berth was secured – the team&#x27;s third in a row. However, the team went down to Penrith in a repeat of the 1990 Grand Final. Jason Croker, the team&#x27;s longest serving player, debuted this year.

The fallout from the salary cap scandal saw several players leave the club, most prominently Glenn Lazarus, Brent Todd, David Barnhill, Nigel Gaffey, and Paul Martin. An average performance resulted, with the Raiders missing the finals for the first time since 1986. David Furner, son of former Raiders and Australian coach Don Furner, started out in this year.

Since their final premiership in 1994 which was a convincing win against the Bulldogs with some of the most spectacular tries ever seen in a grand final with the final score being 36–12. The Raiders have been unable to scale their previous heights, largely due to their inability to lure representative players to the capital. The team bowed out in Round 1 of the 1996 finals series, losing to St George. The next year, they were one of several teams that joined the breakaway Super League competition, losing in the preliminary final to the Cronulla Sharks. It was upon rejoining the newly formed National Rugby League the following year that the team began their decline. The Raiders&#x27; problems came to a head in the late 1990s, when club legends Ricky Stuart and Bradley Clyde were forced out in order to accommodate players such as Brett Finch. Finch would ironically leave the Raiders soon after to play under Stuart, who has since returned to the club to be its head coach from 2014 onwards.

===2000s===
The Raiders had mixed results in the new millennium, often finishing just inside or just outside the final eight and usually being bundled out of the finals in the early weeks, However, in 2003, the Raiders unexpectedly led the competition for most of the season, almost clinching the minor premiership. The Raiders then lost narrowly to the Melbourne Storm in the opening finals game, but still advanced to Week 2 due to ladder position. In one of the closest games in recent history, the Raiders were eclipsed by one point in the preliminary final by the New Zealand Warriors and eliminated from the 2003 competition.

Many fans believed the achievements of 2003 would be improved in the following years. However, the Raiders finished a disappointing 8th in 2004, being knocked out in week one of the finals by the Sydney Roosters. Club legends Ruben Wiki and Mark McLinden left the Raiders for other clubs in this year. Wiki&#x27;s loss, in particular, was a bitter pill to swallow for many Raiders fans, as it was found that the New Zealand Warriors had significantly breached the salary cap in signing him (the Warriors eventually paid the price for this, being docked four competition points at the beginning of the 2006 season). The 2005 side was written off by fans and critics alike, as the club&#x27;s two major signings, Jason Smith and Matt Adamson, were ageing veterans considered well past their prime. However, both, particularly Smith, proved formidable campaigners, and the Raiders were joint competition leaders in Round 10. But as the season progressed, injuries took their toll and the Raiders finished second last on points differential to the Newcastle Knights. The Raiders started season 2006 heavy favourites to run last, but despite this pessimism and heavy losses to the Knights and the Roosters early on, fought back and guaranteed themselves a finals berth with a round to play.

2006 saw club stalwarts Simon Woolford, Clinton Schifcofske and the club&#x27;s longest serving player, Jason Croker, leave the club, going to St George Illawarra, the Queensland Reds rugby union team and the Super League club Catalans Dragons respectively. Outgoing backs Schifcofske and Adam Mogg both earned representative berths with Queensland in State of Origin. Saturday 9 September 2006 saw Jason Croker, Simon Woolford, Clinton Schifcofske, Michael Hodgson, Jason Smith and Adam Mogg all play their final games for the club. The round one finals series clash with the Bulldogs saw the Raiders defeated 30–12 in slippery and muddy conditions at Telstra Stadium, and eliminated from the 2006 premiership race. This was also the final match for coach Matthew Elliott, who is coaching Penrith in 2007. His replacement is former North Queensland Cowboys&#x27; assistant coach Neil Henry.

In 2007, the Raiders were an unknown quantity. Having lost star players such as Schifcofske, Smith, Croker and Woolford in key positions, the Raiders found themselves with a new captain in Alan Tongue relying on young, inexperienced players such as Todd Carney, William Zillman and Michael Dobson to step up and take on more prominent roles within the team. The sense of inexperience was reinforced by the selection of Neil Henry as coach, despite his lack of first-grade coaching experience. Though the Raiders were bolstered by late season signings Neville Costigan and Matt Bickerstaff, several critics believed that the Raiders&#x27; significant loss of experience would result in their &quot;winning&quot; the wooden spoon.

2007 was, overall, a disappointing season for the Raiders, who finished in 14th place despite entering the top 8 midway through the season. However, two players – Phil Graham for Country Origin and Neville Costigan for Queensland – achieved representative status. The season was notable for the difference in the team&#x27;s performance at and away from home, with just 2 of their 9 wins occurring outside Canberra. Coach Neil Henry incurred a fine of $10 000 for questioning the impartiality of the referee after the round 19 clash.

The 2008 season started with some promise for the Raiders – a good showing despite a loss in round 1 vs. Newcastle was followed up with two solid wins against Penrith and St. George-Illawarra. The club then suffered a series of losses, whilst snaring only the occasional victory, with a big come from behind victory against Wests being noteworthy. In the representative field, Todd Carney and Joel Monaghan picked for Country Origin, and Monaghan being a shadow player for the New South Wales Side.
In September 2008, despite a heavy injury toll, the Raiders guaranteed themselves a place in the NRL 2008 Finals Series winning seven of their last nine regular season games, a feat which was at the start of the season impossible according to Rugby League punditry in Australia. The Raiders semi-final appearance was brief, however. After being defeated by the Cronulla Sharks, the Raiders 6th-place finish was considered to be enough to get them a second chance. However, a huge upset with 8th place New Zealand defeating minor premiers Melbourne saw the Raiders eliminated.

The season had not been without controversy however, with star halfback Todd Carney and fullback Bronx Goodwin being stood down by the club after an altercation at a Canberra nightclub following the round 19 win against the Roosters. Carney was eventually dismissed by the club after failing to agree to the punishment plan the club had laid out for him, Goodwin was also sacked from the club.

A slow start to the 2009 season saw the raiders lose to the tigers and the roosters. However, with the help from under 20s debutants Josh Dugan, Jarrod Croker and Travis Waddell they won their next two matches. Despite a disappointing season for the raiders losing to many close games the Raiders were able to beat the Melbourne Storm for the first time in 14 games and 7 years 26–16 in round 16 to keep their slim finals hopes alive. The Raiders also had a memorable win over the number one team at the time St George-Illawarra Dragons, by 24–12. Despite wins against three of the top four (St George Illawarra Dragons, Gold Coast Titans and the Melbourne Storm) and coming within three points of the other (Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs) losses to bottom placed teams Cronulla Sharks and Sydney Roosters at home saw the raiders finish in 13th.

===2010s===
The 2010 season began traditionally poorly for the Raiders with a loss to Penrith in the opening round however against early-season expectations that the Raiders would again struggle the club posted early season wins over Brisbane in round two, Parramatta in round five and the New Zealand Warriors in round eight in New Zealand in what was the club&#x27;s first win in New Zealand since the early 2000s. However, losses to Todd Carney&#x27;s new club the Roosters in round six and a narrow loss at home to the South Sydney Rabbitohs in round seven saw the club sitting second from last after round seven (last had the Melbourne Storm not been stripped of competition points due to salary cap breaches) of the 2010 season. Wins over the ladder-leading Dragons and the Gold Coast Titans followed until a four-game losing streak ensued; with the club sitting third from last after a round 17 home loss to the Roosters in what was Todd Carney&#x27;s return to the nation&#x27;s capital. The Raiders then began a run similar to that of Parramatta last year; winning eight of their next nine regular season matches to sneak into the top eight by season&#x27;s end. The regular season&#x27;s highest home attendance came when 20,445 fans filled Canberra Stadium to see the Raiders defeat the ladder-leading Dragons 32-16 for the second time in the season.

The Raiders advanced to the finals on the back of eight wins from their past nine and were drawn a tough away final against the second-placed Penrith Panthers whom the Raiders had beaten just five weeks earlier. The Raiders led from the start and despite lapses at times during the match the Raiders managed to sniff out a narrow 24–22 win, thus achieving its first final win in a decade, which ironically was also against the Panthers. This saw the Raiders draw a home final against the Wests Tigers in round two of the finals. Having lost to the Tigers twice during the regular season, it was hoped that a record crowd of 26,746 would inspire the Raiders to continue their fairytale run deep into the finals, however a missed penalty attempt by Jarrod Croker in the final minutes of the match saw Canberra lose by 26-24 and therefore draw a curtain on the Raiders&#x27; 2010 season.
The Raiders off season didn&#x27;t start well, with Joel Monaghan being sacked by the club for inappropriate behavior with a teammate&#x27;s dog. This appeared to be a team building exercise, as photos surfaced showing the rest of the team cheering him on.

In 2011, the Raiders bolstered its already strong roster with the addition of Blake Ferguson, Brett White and former Dally M medalist Matt Orford. The latter signing was an important one for the Raiders as vice-captain and star playmaker Terry Campese is out indefinitely due to a knee injury suffered in the semi-final loss to Wests at the end of the 2010 season. After starting the season with a 40-16 thumping of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in round one, the Raiders have since lost their last eight matches in succession, and were sitting at the bottom of the ladder by round nine. Their fortunes started to turn when they caused the boilover of the 2011 season, upsetting the Melbourne Storm in Melbourne by 20–12. This was Canberra&#x27;s first win in the Victorian capital since 2000. This was tempered by being held scoreless for the first time at home in their history by Melbourne in round 19, losing 26–0. One other unlikely win to the Raiders against a 7th place Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs at home 20-12 has kept the momentum building as the Raiders look to turn their season around.

Canberra finished the 2012 NRL season in 6th position on the table and qualified for the finals. The club defeated the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in the qualifying final but were eliminated the following week by South Sydney in the semi-final.

The Raiders 2013 campaign began with two demoralising defeats to Penrith Panthers and Gold Coast Titans, only managing to score 10 points in the two games while conceding 68. Another early blow to the Raiders at the start of the 2013 season was the irresponsible behaviour of up and coming superstar Josh Dugan whom was sacked from the club for disciplinary reasons after he and teammate Blake Ferguson missed a team recovery session in favour of spending the day drinking on the rooftop of Blake Fergusons home. The Raiders then managed to win 5 of the next 7 games including upsets to the undefeated Melbourne Storm away from home and premiership favourites Sydney Roosters, winning all games played at Canberra Stadium for the first 12 rounds of the premiership season.

In 2014, Canberra hired Ricky Stuart as their new head coach. He had large success with the team. Star player, Anthony Milford, agreed to sign with rival team, Brisbane, disappointing Canberra fans. Canberra would finish the 2014 NRL season in 15th place, narrowly avoiding the wooden spoon.

In 2015, the Raiders finished 10th off the back of well below average defence.

In 2016, Canberra finished 2nd, for just the 3rd time in their history. They made the finals for the first time since 2012, Jarrod Croker broke the club point scoring record, they scored the most points for any Raiders team in a single season and they made a preliminary final for the first time since 1997. They eventually lost in the preliminary final 14–12 to the Melbourne Storm at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium.

In 2017, Canberra finished in 10th position with 11 wins and 13 losses.

In the 2018 NRL season, Canberra finished in 10th place on the table and missed out on the finals for the second consecutive season. The year was typified by the fact that the club could not hold onto a lead in many games throughout the season with the club losing games against Brisbane and Penrith despite being between 14 and 18 points ahead in both matches.

The 2018 NRL season saw one of the best starts by the club since the 1990s when they got off to a 5–1 record after the first 6 rounds. At the completion of round 21, Canberra sat in 3rd place with a record of 13 wins and 7 losses which was almost identical position on the ladder and win–loss record they had at the same stage of the 2016 season. 2019 saw the introduction and flying start to their careers for new fullback Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad and the club&#x27;s 4th English recruit John Bateman both of whom were revelations for the club and were in contention for &#x27;signing of the year&#x27;. After beating South Sydney in the preliminary final, Canberra qualified for their first Grand Final in 25 years against the Sydney Roosters.

In the 2019 NRL Grand Final against the Sydney Roosters, Canberra would go on to lose the match 14–8 in controversial circumstances at Stadium Australia. During the second half of the game and with only 10 minutes remaining, Canberra were initially given a new six tackle set after referee Ben Cummins had ruled that the Sydney Roosters had touched the ball. Canberra player Jack Wighton would then be tackled with the ball. Cummins later ruled that it was not a repeat set and it was a handover to the Sydney Roosters. In the following minutes, Easts player James Tedesco would score a final try to end the game and result in the Sydney Roosters&#x27; 15th premiership.

===2020s===
Canberra finished the 2020 NRL season in fifth place narrowly missing out on fourth place. The club would then go on to defeat Cronulla-Sutherland and the Sydney Roosters to set up a preliminary final match against Melbourne. Canberra would go on to lose the preliminary final to Melbourne at Suncorp Stadium which ended their season.

Canberra started the 2021 NRL season as one of the club&#x27;s expected to finish in the top four and challenge for the premiership. After a good start to the year winning the opening two matches, Canberra would only win once in the next seven games. After round 16, Canberra found themselves in 13th place on the table after losing 44–6 against the Gold Coast. The club would then spark an end of season revival winning five of the next eight matches to be just outside the finals places. In the final round of the season, Canberra needed to beat the Sydney Roosters and hope other results went their way in order to qualify for the finals. Canberra would lose the match 40–16, which saw them finish the year in 10th place.

Canberra started the 2022 NRL season poorly which included a run of five straight losses. By round 14, Canberra were 11th on the table and looked unlikely to reach the top 8 until the club went on to win eight of their last ten matches to leapfrog Brisbane into 8th place. In week one of the finals, Canberra upset Melbourne 28–20 at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium. The following week, Canberra were defeated 40–4 by Parramatta which ended their season.

Canberra would finish the 2023 NRL season in 8th place as they qualified for the finals. In week one, the club were eliminated by Newcastle, losing 30–28 after extra-time. The loss also meant that Canberra&#x27;s premiership drought would be extended to a 30th season.
In the 2024 NRL season, Canberra finished 9th on the table which was equal on points with 8th placed Newcastle, however the club missed the finals due to a worse for/against record. The club were all but wrote off from playing in the finals after their round 24 loss against North Queensland but managed to record three wins to close out the season including upset victories over Penrith and the Sydney Roosters.

==Toyota Cup (Under 20s)==
The Raiders&#x27; Toyota Cup team won 28–24 over the Broncos&#x27; team in golden point extra time to win the Toyota Cup (Under 20s) Premiership in the lead-up game to the NRL Grand Final on 5 October 2008. In 2009 the team was unsuccessful in defending its National Youth Competition title, finishing eighth at the end of the regular season. The team were able to upset the minor premiers Manly in week one of the finals but lost to the Wests Tigers in week two ending their title defence.

===Finals appearances===
24 (1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2016, 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023)

==Emblem and colours==

Since inception, the Raiders&#x27; team colours have been lime green and white with blue and gold bands. In recent years, the &quot;away&quot; strip for the team has been mostly white, with lime green, blue and gold bands. The lime green was chosen as the main colour as it differentiated the side from the colours of other clubs. The blue and gold were included in the Raiders colours as they are the traditional sporting colours of the Australian Capital Territory.

The original jersey&#x27;s design was chosen through a competition held by the club in 1981. The winning entrant was Ms Patricia Taylor, whose design was duly adopted. The lime green colour was selected from the entry of David Lane, who had submitted a design with the team name of &#x27;Canberra Cockatoos&#x27;.

==Stadium==

===Seiffert Oval===
From 1982 until the end of 1989, the Raiders played their home games at the Seiffert Oval located in Queanbeyan in New South Wales. They played their first game at the ground on 6 March 1982 against the Western Suburbs Magpies. the Magpies won this game 33–4 in front of 6,769 fans. The Raiders first win at Seiffert came on 18 April with a 21–11 win over 1981 Grand Finalists Newtown.

Overall, the Raiders would play 98 games at Seiffert Oval, winning 52, losing 45 with one drawn game. Canberra&#x27;s largest attendance at Seiffert came in Round 12 of the 1989 season when 18,272 saw the Raiders triumph 27–6 over the Brisbane Broncos who were coached by former Raiders co-coach Wayne Bennett.

===Bruce/Canberra Stadium===
In 1990, the Canberra Raiders moved out of their original home and into the spacious Bruce Stadium which is located adjacent to the Australian Institute of Sport. The club has remained at Bruce Stadium (later renamed Canberra Stadium, then GIO Stadium due to current naming rights sponsorship) ever since. As of the end of the 2022 NRL season, the Canberra Raiders have played over 300 games at Canberra Stadium.

The Raiders attendance record at Canberra Stadium stands at 26,567 for a Finals week 3 clash against the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2019. The Raiders beat Souths 16–10 to progress to their first Grand Final since 1994.

The club shares the ground with Super Rugby team the ACT Brumbies.

==Canberra Raiders Leagues Club==

The Queanbeyan Leagues Club (QLC) was founded in 1963.

In December 1972, QLC was burnt to the ground and rebuilt a year later. As a part of the redevelopment, the famous &quot;Blue Room&quot; was built. The Blue Room became the place to go in the region with its silver service dining and musical entertainment. Also rebuilt was the QLC&#x27;s auditorium, which brought headline acts to Queanbeyan including the Delltones and Johnny O&#x27;Keefe.

In 1989, the Auditorium was revamped and a nightclub was built. In 1982, the Canberra Raiders were established, and with them and their early success, QLC continued to grow in leaps and bounds.

The club is part of the Raiders Group which operate across the ACT and Queanbeyan and includes:
*Raiders Belconnen
*Raiders Gungahlin
*Raiders Mawson Club
*Raiders Weston

<text>Blaise of Sebaste (, &quot;Hágios Blásios&quot;; martyred 316 AD) was a physician and bishop of Sebastea in historical Lesser Armenia (modern Sivas, Turkey) who is venerated as a Christian saint and martyr. He is counted as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers.

Blaise is a saint in the Catholic, Western Rite Orthodoxy, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches and is the patron saint of wool combers and of sufferers from ENT illnesses. In the Latin Church, his feast falls on 3 February. In the Eastern Churches, it is on 11 February. According to the &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot;, he was martyred by being beaten, tortured with iron combs, and beheaded.

==Early records==
The first reference to Blaise is the medical writings of Aëtius Amidenus () where his aid is invoked in treating patients with objects stuck in the throat.

Marco Polo reported on the place where &quot;Messer Saint Blaise obtained the glorious crown of martyrdom&quot;, Sebastea. The shrine near the citadel mount was mentioned by William of Rubruck in 1253, although the ruins are no longer visible. 

==Life==
It is said from being a healer of bodily ailments, Saint Blaise was to become an expert on souls, then he retired for a time to a cavern where he remained in prayer. As bishop of Sebastea, Blaise instructed people as much by his example as by his words, and his great virtues and his sanctity were attested by many miracles. People were said to flock to him for cures of bodily and spiritual ills. He is said to have healed animals, who came to him on their own for his assistance, and in turn to have been helped by animals.

In 316 the governor of Cappadocia and Lesser Armenia, Agricola, began a persecution of him by order of the Emperor Licinius, and Blaise was seized. After his interrogation and a severe scourging, he was imprisoned and subsequently beheaded.

==Acts of St Blaise==

The legendary &quot;Acts of St Blaise&quot; were written 400 years after his death.

The legend narrative is as follows:
Blaise, who had studied philosophy in his youth, was a doctor in Sebaste in Armenia, the city of his birth, who exercised his art with miraculous ability, good-will, and piety. When the bishop of the city died, he was chosen to succeed him, with the acclamation of all the people. His holiness was manifest through many miracles: from all around, people came to him to find cures for their spirit and their body; even wild animals came in herds to receive his blessing. In 316, Agricola, the governor of Cappadocia and of Lesser Armenia, having arrived in Sebastia at the order of the emperor Licinius to kill the Christians, arrested the bishop. As he was being led to jail, a mother set her only son, choking to death of a fish-bone, at his feet, and the child was cured straight away. Regardless, the governor, unable to make Blaise renounce his faith, beat him with a stick, ripped his flesh with iron combs, and beheaded him.
As the governor&#x27;s men led Blaise back to Sebastea, on the way, they met a poor woman whose pig had been seized by a wolf. At the command of Blaise, the wolf restored the pig to its owner, alive and unhurt. When he had reached the capital and was thrown in prison to await execution, the old woman whose pig he had saved came to see him, bringing two fine wax candles to dispel the gloom of his dark cell. In the West, there had been no group honouring St Blaise prior to the 8th century.

==Blessing of St Blaise==
According to the &quot;Acts&quot;, while Blaise was being taken into custody, a distraught mother, whose only child was choking on a fish bone, threw herself at his feet and implored his intercession. Touched by her distress, he offered up his prayers, and the child was cured. Traditionally, Saint Blaise is invoked for protection against injuries and illnesses of the throat.

In many places, on the day of his feast the blessing of St Blaise is given: two candles (sometimes lit), blessed on the feast of the Presentation of the Lord (Candlemas), are held in the form of a cross by a priest over the heads of the faithful or the people are touched on the throat with them. At the same time the following blessing is given: &quot;Through the intercession of Saint Blaise, bishop and martyr, may God deliver you from every disease of the throat and from every other illness&quot;. Then the priest makes the sign of the cross over the faithful.

==Veneration of Saint Blaise==

One of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, Blaise became one of the most popular saints of the Middle Ages. His followers became widespread in Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries and his legend is recounted in the 13th-century &quot;Legenda Aurea&quot;. Saint Blaise is the saint of the wild beast.

He is patron of the Armenian Order of Saint Blaise. In Italy he is known as &quot;San Biagio&quot;. In Spanish-speaking countries, he is known as San Blas, and has lent his name to many places (see San Blas). Several places in Portugal and Brazil are also named after him, where he is called São Brás (see São Brás).

Many German churches, including the former Abbey of St Blasius in the Black Forest and the church of Balve, are dedicated to Saint Blaise/Blasius.

===In Croatia===
Saint Blaise () is the patron saint of the city of Dubrovnik and formerly the protector of the independent Republic of Ragusa. At Dubrovnik, his feast is celebrated yearly on 3 February, when relics of the saint, his skull, a bit of bone from his throat and his right and left hands are paraded in reliquaries. The festivities begin the previous day, Candlemas, when white doves are released. Chroniclers of Dubrovnik such as Rastic and Ranjina attribute his veneration there to a vision in 971 to warn the inhabitants of an impending attack by the Venetians, whose galleys had dropped anchor in Gruž and near Lokrum, ostensibly to resupply their water but furtively to spy out the city&#x27;s defences. Blaise (Blasius) revealed their pernicious plan to Stojko, a canon of St Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral. The Senate summoned Stojko, who told them in detail how St Blaise had appeared before him as an old man with a long beard and a bishop&#x27;s mitre and staff. In this form, the effigy of Blaise remained on Dubrovnik&#x27;s state seal and coinage until the Napoleonic era. He has an importance similar to that of St Mark to Venice. One of the larger churches in the city is dedicated to Saint Blaise.

The feast of &quot;Sveti Vlaho&quot; is 3 February. The city of Dubrovnik celebrates the holiday with Mass, parades, and festivities that last for several days.

===In Great Britain===

In Cornwall the town of St Blazey and the civil parish of St Blaise are derived from his name, where the parish church is still dedicated to Saint Blaise. The Council of Oxford in 1222 forbade all work on his feast day. There is a church dedicated to Saint Blaise in the Devon hamlet of Haccombe, near Newton Abbot, one at Shanklin on the Isle of Wight and another at Milton near Abingdon in Oxfordshire, one of the country&#x27;s smallest churches. Haccombe Church, unusually, retains the office of an &quot;archpriest&quot;.

There is a St Blaise&#x27;s Well in Bromley, London where the water was considered to have medicinal virtues. St Blaise is also associated with Stretford in Lancashire. A Blessing of the Throats ceremony is held on 3 February at St Etheldreda&#x27;s Church in London and in Balve, Germany. The blessing is performed in many Catholic parish churches, often at the end of a morning Mass.

Blaise Castle and the nearby Blaise Hamlet in Bristol derive their name from a 13th-century chapel dedicated to St Blaise, built on a site previously occupied by an Iron Age fort and a Roman temple.

In Bradford, West Yorkshire a Catholic middle school named after St Blaise was operated by the Diocese of Leeds from 1961 to 1995. The name was chosen due to the connections of Bradford to the woollen industry and the method that St Blaise was martyred, with the woolcomb. Due to reorganisation, the school closed down when Catholic middle schools were phased out, and the building was sold to Bradford Council to provide replacement accommodation for another local middle school which had burned down. Within a few months, St Blaise school was also severely damaged in a fire, and the remains of the building were demolished. A new primary school was built on the land, and most of the extensive grounds were sold off for housing.

There is a 14th-century wall painting of St Blaise in All Saints Church, Kingston upon Thames, located by the market place, marking the significance of the wool trade in the economic expansion of the market town in the 14th and 15th centuries.

===Blaise and Blasius of Jersey===
In England in the 18th and 19th centuries, Blaise was adopted as the mascot of woolworkers&#x27; pageants, particularly in Essex, Yorkshire, Wiltshire and Norwich. The popular enthusiasm for the saint is explained by the belief that Blaise had brought prosperity (as symbolised by the Woolsack) to England by teaching the English to comb wool. According to the tradition as recorded in printed broadsheets, Blaise came from Jersey, Channel Islands. Jersey was certainly a centre of export of woollen goods (as witnessed by the name &quot;jersey&quot; for the woollen textile). However, this legend is probably the result of confusion with a different saint, Blasius of Caesarea (&quot;Caesarea&quot; being also the Latin name of Jersey).

===In Iceland===
Blaise (Icelandic: &quot;Blasíus&quot;) was prominent in Iceland, in particular Southwestern Iceland, where he was known for his purported miracle-working powers. Saint Blaise is mentioned in &quot;Þorláks saga helga&quot;, an Icelandic saga about Thorlak Thorhallsson, the patron saint of Iceland.

===In India===
St Blaise Church, Sao Bras, Goa, India was a small Chapel built in 1541 by Croatian sailors and traders settled in the village. It was elevated to a Parish Church in 1563. The church is a replica of the one in Dubrovnik, dedicated to St Blaise, the patron of the city.

===In Italy===

In Italy, Saint Blaise&#x27;s remains rest at the Basilica on Monte San Biagio, a mountain named in his honour, over the town of Maratea, Basilicata, shipwrecked there during Leo III the Isaurian&#x27;s iconoclastic persecutions, on their first journey out of Sebastea to Europe.

In the small village of Sicilì in Campania, Saint Blaise’s feast day is celebrated on 3 February but also on 14 May. Locals come to the shrine dedicated to him to show their respect and devotion but also to ask him for help with healing someone who has fallen ill where a special prayer is required.

==Iconography==
In iconography, Blaise is represented holding two crossed candles in his hand (the Blessing of St Blaise), or in a cave surrounded by wild beasts, as he was found by the hunters of the governor. He is often shown with the instruments of his martyrdom, steel combs. The similarity of these instruments of torture to wool combs led to his adoption as the patron saint of wool combers in particular, and the wool trade in general. He may also be depicted with crossed candles. Such crossed candles are used for the blessing of throats on his feast day, which falls on 3 February, the day after Candlemas on the General Roman Calendar. Blaise is traditionally believed to intercede in cases of throat illnesses, especially for fish-bones stuck in the throat. He is also called upon to aid in protection against obstructive sleep apnea since this involves the throat tissues interfering with breathing during sleep. (Non-OSA sleep disorders are typically invoked with the intercession of St Dymphna since these are more neurological in nature.)

==Relics==
There are multiple relics of Blaise in a variety of churches and chapels, including multiple whole bodies, at least four heads and several jaws, at least eight arms, and so on:

With a little research, we would find Saint Blaise armed with a hundred arms, like the giant of the fable. The fingers, teeth, feet of this voluminous saint are too scattered for us to undertake to bring them together.
&lt;br&gt;
— Collin de Plancy, 1822

<text>Juan Rafael Mora Porras (8 February 1814, San José, Costa Rica – 30 September 1860) was President of Costa Rica from 1849 to 1859.

==Life and career==
Mora first assumed the presidency upon the resignation of his younger brother, Miguel Mora Porras. He was subsequently elected in his own right in 1853, and he was reelected in 1859.

He (along with the rest of his administration) focused on modifying the Costa Rican constitution, with one of his modifications being an increase in the requirements to hold Costa Rican citizenship—including a high yearly income. He therefore left the majority of the population without the rights to vote and run for office (Conversely, the previous electoral system required citizens to be male, born in the country, and of age to have electoral rights).

As Mora’s dramatic change to Costa Rica’s constitution coincided with the privatization of the country’s commons, its landless peasants were now left helpless. As Mora altogether deprived the commons-dependent peasants, they no longer possessed constitutional rights to political representation or constitutional means of achieving it.

==The Filibuster War==

In 1856, Mora led his country&#x27;s forces in Central America&#x27;s Filibuster War against William Walker and his filibuster regime in Nicaragua.

(For Costa Rican historiography, the war is divided into three parts: The First Campaign (March and April 1856), The Second (or Transit) Campaign (October 1856–May 1857), and The Third Campaign (August–December 1857)).

Mora, along with Bishop Anselmo Llorente, gave a series of speeches to arouse the people and prepare them for the upcoming war. In his speeches, he emphasized the threat posed by the Protestant filibusters to the country&#x27;s Catholic identity.

He then moved to his brother José Joaquín Mora Porras the supreme command of the army, and his brother led three battles during the First Campaign. Specifically, he charged José Joaquin to lead the Battles of Santa Rosa, Sardinal, and Rivas (a series of battles which managed to stop Walker&#x27;s invasion to Guanacaste—at the time known as &quot;Moracia&quot; in the president&#x27;s honour).

===The Resulting 1856 Cholera Epidemic===

During the Rivas Battle, both the filibuster forces and Costa Rican forces contracted cholera. Costa Ricans subsequently found themselves under the impression that cholera was acquired on &quot;ill-aired&quot; locations, and they therefore fled from Rivas. As a result of taking the water-borne disease with them, they inadvertently caused a tenth of Costa Ricans to lose their lives in the 1856 cholera epidemic in Costa Rica.

For Costa Ricans, the war was then postponed until October 1856, the starting point for The Second Campaign.

===The Resumption of the War, And the War’s Aftermath ===

Mora and his brother placed the emphasis of the Second Campaign on the Costa Rican armed forces cutting off Walker&#x27;s supply route which used the San Juan River and the steamboats taken by the filibusters from the Accessory Transit Company.

There is, by contrast, no knowledge of what they did or what else happened during the Third Campaign.

There is still discussion on the intellectual authorship of the capture of the Rio San Juan. Some Costa Ricans, like historian Rafael Obregón Loría, claim it was Mora who planned the capture. However, Mora met in November 1856 with Silvanius Spencer, Cornelius Vanderbilt&#x27;s agent, who offered his help on the capture of the San Juan river.

In spite of earning acclaim as a national hero for his efforts in that endeavor, he was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état orchestrated by his opponent Jose Maria Montealegre in August 1859. He fled to El Salvador, where his supporters convinced him to launch an attack on Costa Rica and recoup the presidency. After initial victories, in which he succeeded in seizing the port of Puntarenas, he was defeated, captured, and, on 30 September 1860, brought before a firing squad.

==Notable relatives==
His nephew, who he helped to raise, was the writer Manuel Argüello Mora. His great-great-grandniece is the actress Madeleine Stowe, who is also of a member Montealegre family.

==Legacy==

His statue is erected in Ankara, Türkiye.

<text>Henryk Sławik (16 July 1894 – 23 August 1944) was a Polish politician in the interwar period, social worker, activist, and diplomat, who during World War II helped save over 30,000 Polish refugees, including 5,000 Polish Jews in Budapest, Hungary, by giving them false Polish passports with Catholic designation. He was executed with some of his fellow Polish activists on order of Reichsführer SS in concentration camp Gusen on 23 August 1944.

==Life==

Henryk Sławik was born 16 July 1894 in &quot;Timmendorf&quot; (now Szeroka, a part of Jastrzębie-Zdrój), into an impoverished Polish Silesian family as one of its 5 children. He was sent by his mother to an academic secondary school. After graduation, Sławik left his hometown for Pszczyna where he was drafted to the army during World War I. Released from internment in 1918, he joined the Polish Socialist Party in Upper Silesia and went to Warsaw for additional training. He took active part in the Silesian Plebiscite as one of its organizers and began working as a journalist for &quot;&quot;. A year later, he became its editor-in-chief.

In 1922 Sławik was elected president of the Regional Chapter of the Worker&#x27;s Youth Association &quot;Siła&quot; and took part in setting up Worker&#x27;s Universities. In 1928 he married a Varsovian, Jadwiga Purzycka, and in 1929 was chosen as councillor for Katowice City Hall on PPS platform. He was an ardent opponent of Sanacja. Between 1934 and 1939 Sławik served as president of Polish Journalist Association of Silesia and Zagłębie (Syndykat Dziennikarzy Polskich Śląska i Zagłębia).

===World War II===
At the outbreak of the German invasion of Poland in 1939 Sławik joined the Polish mobilised police battalion attached to the Kraków Army. He fought with distinction during the retreat along the northern Carpathians. His battalion was attached to the 2nd Mountain Brigade, with which he defended mountain passes leading to Slovakia. On 15 September Sławik and his men were ordered to retreat towards the newly established border with Hungary. On 17 September, after the Soviet Union joined the war against Poland, Sławik crossed the border and was interned as a prisoner of war camp. In Silesia, his name appeared on the Nazi German list of the &quot;enemies of the state&quot; (&quot;Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen&quot;).

Sławik was spotted in the PoW camp near Miskolc by József Antall (Senior), a member of the Hungarian ministry of internal affairs responsible for the civilian refugees and the father of the future prime minister József Antall (Junior). Thanks to his fluent knowledge of German, Sławik was brought to Budapest and allowed to create the Citizen&#x27;s Committee for Help for Polish Refugees (&quot;Komitet Obywatelski ds. Opieki nad Polskimi Uchodźcami&quot;). Together with József Antall he organised jobs for the POWs and displaced persons, schools and orphanages. He also clandestinely organised an organisation whose purpose was to help the exiled Poles leave the camps of internment and travel to France or the Middle East to join the Polish Army. His colleague was Ernest Niżałowski lieutenant and interpreter, who was a Polish-Hungarian citizen. Sławik also became a delegate of the Polish Government in Exile.

===The Polish Wallenberg===
After the Hungarian government issued racial decrees and separated Polish refugees of Jewish descent from their colleagues, Sławik started to issue false documents confirming their Polish roots and Roman Catholic faith. He also helped several hundred Polish Jews to reach Yugoslav Partisans. One of his initiatives was the creation of an orphanage for Jewish children (officially named &quot;School for Children of Polish Officers&quot;) in Vác. To help disguise the true nature of the orphanage, the children were visited by Catholic Church authorities, most notably by nuncio Angelo Rotta.

After the Nazis took over Hungary in March 1944, Sławik went underground and ordered as many of the refugees as were under his command to leave Hungary. Because he had appointed a new commanding officer of the camp for Polish Jews, all of them were able to escape and leave Hungary. The Jewish children of the orphanage in Vác were also evacuated. Sławik was arrested by the Germans on 19 March 1944. Although brutally tortured, he did not inform on his Hungarian colleagues. He was sent to the concentration camp Gusen where he was hanged with some of his fellows on 23 August 1944. His wife survived the Ravensbrück concentration camp and after the war found their daughter hidden in Hungary by the Antall family. Sławik&#x27;s place of burial remains unknown.

It is estimated that Henryk Sławik helped as many as 30,000 Polish refugees in Hungary, approximately 5,000 of them Jews. After 1948, the communist authorities of both Poland and Hungary did commemorate his deeds and pointed out his importance for humanity. According to Maria Zawadzka of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews, Henryk Sławik was posthumously awarded the title of Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem Commemorative Authority already on 26 January 1977, but achieved wide recognition only after Zvi Henryk Zimmerman, his wartime associate and a distinguished Israeli politician, popularized his efforts in the 1990s.

== Career statistics ==

===Major tournament performance timeline===

* The 1989 and 2001 World and Open Championships were combined events.

==Style==
Fulford&#x27;s playing style includes the ability to play a range of shots. His tactic of peeling an opponent&#x27;s ball through hoop 1 makes a triple peel as hard as possible for the opponent. His sextuple peels are also more frequent than those of any other player. Robert Fulford uses an Irish grip [rather like a golf grip] and employs &quot;casting&quot; [swinging mallet over the ball] about three times before each shot. He has strong wrists which makes the Irish grip work for him without it causing the R.S.I. that the grip is sometimes blamed for. In fact, Robert admits that he has quite a wrist-dominated technique which contradicts most coaching manuals that advise minimal wrist involvement.
