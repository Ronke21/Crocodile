<doc id="458483" wikidata="Q777763" url="?curid=458483" title="Indiana Territory">
<text>The Indiana Territory, officially the Territory of Indiana, was created by an organic act that President John Adams signed into law on May 7, 1800, to form an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from July 4, 1800, to December 11, 1816, when the remaining southeastern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the state of Indiana. The territory originally contained approximately of land, but its size was decreased when it was subdivided to create the Michigan Territory (1805) and the Illinois Territory (1809). The Indiana Territory was the first new territory created from lands of the Northwest Territory, which had been organized under the terms of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The territorial capital was the settlement around the old French fort of Vincennes on the Wabash River, until transferred to Corydon near the Ohio River in 1813.

William Henry Harrison, the territory&#x27;s first governor, oversaw treaty negotiations with the Native inhabitants that ceded tribal lands to the U.S. government, opening large parts of the territory to further settlement. In 1809 the U.S. Congress established a bicameral legislative body for the territory that included a popularly-elected House of Representatives and a Legislative Council. In addition, the territorial government began planning for a basic transportation network and education system, but efforts to attain statehood for the territory were delayed due to war. At the outbreak of Tecumseh&#x27;s War, when the territory was on the front line of battle, Harrison led a military force in the opening hostilities at the Battle of Tippecanoe (1811) and in the subsequent invasion of Canada during the War of 1812. After Harrison resigned as the territorial governor, Thomas Posey was appointed to the vacant governorship, but the opposition party, led by Congressman Jonathan Jennings, dominated territorial affairs in its final years and began pressing for statehood.

In June 1816 a constitutional convention was held at Corydon, where a state constitution was adopted on June 29, 1816. General elections were held in August to fill offices for the new state government, the new officeholders were sworn into office in November, and the territory was dissolved. On December 11, 1816, President James Madison signed the congressional act that formally admitted Indiana to the Union as the nineteenth state.

==Geographical boundaries==
When the Indiana Territory was formed in 1800, its original boundaries included the western portion of the Northwest Territory. This encompassed an area northwest of a line beginning at the Ohio River, on the bank opposite the mouth of the Kentucky River, extending northeast to Fort Recovery in present-day western Ohio, and north to the border between the United States and Canada along a line approximately 84 degrees 45 minutes West longitude.

The territory initially included most of the present-day state of Indiana; all of present-day states of Illinois and Wisconsin; fragments of present-day Minnesota that were east of the Mississippi River; nearly all of the Upper Peninsula and the western half of the Lower Peninsula of present-day Michigan; and a narrow strip of land in present-day Ohio that was northwest of Fort Recovery. This latter parcel became part of Ohio when it attained statehood in 1803. The Indiana Territory&#x27;s southeast boundary was shifted in 1803 when Ohio became a state, to the mouth of the Great Miami River. In addition, the eastern part of present-day Michigan was added to the Indiana Territory. The territory&#x27;s geographical area was further reduced in 1805 with the creation of the Michigan Territory to the north, and in 1809 when the Illinois Territory was established to the west.

== Population ==
In 1800 the Indiana Territory&#x27;s total white population was 5,641, but its Native American population was estimated to be near 20,000, possibly as high as 75,000. In the 1800 United States census, 4 counties in the Indiana Territory (2 of which were located in contemporary Illinois and 1 in contemporary Michigan) reported the following counts:
In the 1810 United States census, following the passage of organic acts by the 9th U.S. Congress to create the Michigan Territory in 1805 and by the 10th U.S. Congress to create the Illinois Territory in 1809, 4 counties in the Indiana Territory located within contemporary Indiana reported the following population counts:
==Government==
The Indiana Territory&#x27;s government passed through a non-representative phase from 1800 to 1804; a semi-legislative second phase, which included the election of lower house of the territorial legislature, that extended through the ongoing hostilities with Native Americans and the War of 1812; and a final period, when the territory&#x27;s population increased and its residents successfully petitioned Congress for statehood in 1816.

Under the terms of the Northwest Ordinance, the territorial government went through 3 phases prior to statehood:

# During the non-representative phase of territorial government the U.S. Congress and after 1789, the president with congressional approval appointed a governor, secretary, and three judges to govern each new territory. Local inhabitants did not elect these territorial officials. This phase lasted from the territory&#x27;s creation in 1800 until 1804.
# During the semi-legislative phase of government, the territory&#x27;s adult males who owned at least fifty acres of land elected representatives to the lower house of the territorial legislature. In addition the Congress (and later the president with congressional approval) appointed five adult males who owned at least five hundred acres of land to the upper house of the territorial legislature from a list of ten candidates that the lower house submitted for consideration. The upper and lower houses could legislate for the territory, but the territorial governor retained absolute veto power. This phase began in 1805.
# When the territory reached a population of 60,000 free inhabitants, it entered the final phase that included its successful petition to Congress for statehood.

In 1803, when the Indiana Territory was formed from the remaining Northwest Territory after Ohio attained statehood, the requirement for proceeding to the semi-legislative phase of territorial government was modified. Instead of requiring the territory&#x27;s population to reach 5,000 free adult males, the second phase could be initiated when the majority of territory&#x27;s free landholders informed the territorial governor that they wanted to do so. In 1810 the requirement for voters to be landholders was replaced with a law granting voting rights to all free adult males who paid county or territorial taxes and had resided in the territory for at least one year.

===Governors===
Because of William Henry Harrison&#x27;s leadership in securing passage of the Land Act of 1800 and his help in forming the Indiana Territory in 1800, while serving as the Northwest Territory&#x27;s delegate to the U.S. Congress, it was not surprising that President John Adams chose him to become the first governor of the territory. Presidents Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison made a total of three appointments to the office of governor of the Indiana Territory between July 4, 1800, when the territory was officially established, and November 7, 1816, when Jonathan Jennings was sworn in as the first governor of the state of Indiana.


===Judicial court===
When the Indiana Territory was created, the Ordinance of 1787 made no provision for a popularly-elected territorial government in the non-representative phase of territorial government (1800 to 1804). Instead of separate legislative and judicial branches of the territorial government, the U.S. Congress, and later, the president with congressional approval, had the authority to appoint a general court consisting of three territorial judges. The judges were initially appointed by the president who later delegated this authority to the territorial governor. Adams chose William Clarke, Henry Vanderburgh, and John Griffin as the territory&#x27;s first three judges. Following Clarke&#x27;s death in November 1802, Thomas T. Davis was appointed as his replacement.

Acting as the combined judicial and legislative government, the territorial governor and the three judges adopted the laws to govern the territory. In addition to working with the territorial governor on legislative issues, the territorial judges presided over the general court. When the Indiana Territory entered the semi-legislative phase of government in 1805, the legislature gradually became the dominant branch, and the judges focused on judicial matters. In 1814, as the territory progressed toward statehood, three circuit courts were established. Governor Posey appointed Isaac Blackford, Jesse Lynch Holman, and Elijah Sparks as presiding judges over the circuit courts. James Noble was appointed to replace Sparks following Sparks&#x27; death in early 1815.

===Legislature===
When the Indiana Territory entered its semi-legislative phase of government, territorial inhabitants were allowed to elect representatives to the lower house of its bicameral legislature. President Jefferson delegated the task of choosing the five members of the Legislative Council (upper house of the legislature) to the governor, who chose from a list of ten candidates provided by the lower house.

After the formation of the new legislative body, each county in the territory was granted the right to elect representatives to the House of Representatives (the legislative assembly&#x27;s lower house). The lower house initially included seven representatives: one from Dearborn County, one from Clark County, two from Knox County, two from St. Clair County, and one from Randolph County. The territorial legislature met for the first time on July 29, 1805. Governor Harrison retained his veto powers as well as his general executive and appointive authority, while the legislative assembly had the authority to pass laws, subject to the governor&#x27;s approved before they could be enacted. The change in territorial governance also removed the territorial judges&#x27; legislative powers, leaving the territorial court with only its judicial authority.

In 1809, after the Indiana Territory was divided to create the Illinois Territory, the U.S. Congress altered the makeup of the territorial legislature. The members of the House of Representatives continued to be elected by the territorial inhabitants and were apportioned in relation to each county&#x27;s population, but membership in the five-member upper house (Legislative Council) was also by popular vote and apportioned among the territory&#x27;s counties. Harrison County, established in 1808 from portions of Knox and Clark counties, elected one representative to the lower house; Clark and Dearborn counties each had two representatives; and the more populated Knox County had three. This bicameral legislative structure remained unchanged for the remainder of the territory&#x27;s existence.

===Congressional delegation===
Territorial delegates to the U.S. House of Representatives could attend congressional sessions with the right to debate, submit legislation, and serve on committees, but they were not permitted to vote on legislation. When the Indiana Territory entered its second phase of governance, the territory&#x27;s legislative assembly elected Benjamin Parke as its delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. Jesse B. Thomas was appointed to the post following Parke&#x27;s resignation in 1808. Congress approved a law in 1809 that allowed the territory&#x27;s inhabitants to choose a delegate to Congress in a territory-wide election. Jonathan Jennings defeated Thomas Randolph, the territory&#x27;s attorney general and Harrison&#x27;s chosen candidate, in a highly contested race to become the territory&#x27;s first popularly-elected representative to the U.S. Congress. Jennings was reelected to the post in 1811, 1812, and 1814, prior to his election as the first governor of Indiana in 1816.

===Other high officials===
In addition to the territorial governor and three judges, the office of secretary was established in 1800. Governor Harrison appointed a treasurer and attorney general in 1801 as the only additional government officials during the territory&#x27;s non-representative phase of government. During the second phase, the office of territorial auditor was combined with the office of territorial treasurer. The territory also had a chancellor during most of this period.

===Territorial finances===
During the non-legislative phase, the federal government paid the salaries of the governor, the three-member judicial council, and the territorial secretary, which cost about $5,500 per year. In addition, a small fund of approximately $200 covered other expenses such as printing, postage, and rent. The federal government did not provide funds for any additional governmental offices such as the treasurer and attorney general. Salaries for these officials were paid from the territory&#x27;s treasury.

In the semi-legislative phase, the federal government paid the salaries of the territorial governor, judges, and secretary at a cost of approximately $6,687 per year. The territorial treasury was responsible for funding legislative expenses, as well as the salaries of the treasurer, auditor, attorney general, and chancellor. The territorial treasurer also paid operational expenses such as printing, rent, stationery, and other supplies and services. These expenses were estimated to cost $10,000 per year.

Revenue for the territory was limited, with the primary source of funds coming from the sale of federal lands. Other revenue came from the collection of duties, licenses, and excise taxes. In 1811 property taxes collected from landowners were based on the numbers of acres and its rating; previously, these taxes were based on land values. Taxes were also collected for territorial counties to use. After 1815 taxes were levied on some types of manufactured goods to provide additional funds for the territorial government.

Territorial revenue fell to critical levels due to the War of 1812, when many of the territory&#x27;s taxpayers were unable to pay what they owed, and their land reverted to the federal government. Financial issues also caused the movement for statehood to be delayed until after the war&#x27;s end. At one point during 1813, for example, the balance in territory&#x27;s treasury was a meager $2.47. To increase the treasury, tax levies were modified and new forms of revenue were established. These changes included reductions in some taxes, increases in others, and implementing licensing requirements for some types of business ventures in order to stabilize revenue. William Prince, the first territorial auditor, was also blamed for the territory&#x27;s revenue shortage because he had failed to collect taxes from two territorial counties.

Growth of territory&#x27;s population helped improve its financial situation through the collection of various taxes, including property taxes and taxes on sale of public lands. However, governmental expenses also increased as new counties and towns were formed, causing the need for new governmental offices and further increases in the government&#x27;s overall size.

==Political issues==
The major political issue in Indiana&#x27;s territorial history was slavery; however, there were others, including Indian affairs, the formation of northern and western territories from portions of the Indiana Territory, concerns about the lack of territorial self-government and representation in Congress, and ongoing criticisms of Harrison&#x27;s actions as territorial governor.

Most of these issues were resolved before Indiana achieved statehood. The formations of the Michigan Territory and the Illinois Territory ended the debate about the territory&#x27;s geographical size. In the second phase of territorial governance, the increasing democratization of the government shifted the authority initially placed in the hands of the territorial governor and a judicial council to a legislative branch of elected representatives and a delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. The debate over the issue of allowing slavery in the territory was settled in 1810; however, criticism of Governor Harrison continued, even after much of his authority was transferred to territorial legislators and judges.

===Slavery===
In December 1802 delegates from Indiana Territory&#x27;s four counties passed a resolution in favor of a ten-year suspension of Article Six of the Northwest Ordinance, which prohibited slavery in the original Northwest Territory. They also petitioned Congress for the suspension in order to make the region more appealing to slave-holding settlers and ultimately make the territory economically viable by increasing its population. In addition, the petition requested that the slaves and their children brought into the territory during the suspension period should remain slaves even after the suspension ended. Benjamin Parke, a pro-slavery supporter who became the territory&#x27;s first representative in Congress in 1805, carried the petition to Washington, D.C.; however, Congress failed to take action, leaving Harrison and the territorial judges to pursue other options.

In 1803 Harrison and the general court judges passed legislation that evaded the Ordinance of 1787 in order permit slavery in the Indiana Territory through the use of indentured servitude laws. The bill allowed adult slaves owned or purchased outside the territory to be brought into the territory and bound into service for fixed terms set by the slave owner. After the territory was granted representation in Congress in 1805, Parke was able to get Congress to pass legislation to suspend Article Six for ten years, granting the territories covered under the ordinance the ability to legalize slavery in their territories.

Harrison&#x27;s attempts to allow slavery in the Indiana Territory caused a significant opposition from the Quakers who had settled in the eastern part of the territory. They responded by forming an anti-slavery party. Davis Floyd of Clark County was the only anti-slavery representative elected to the territory&#x27;s House of Representatives in the 1805 election, but Harrison&#x27;s measures to legalize slavery in the territory were blocked by the two representatives from St. Clair County, who refused to authorize slavery unless Harrison supported their request for a separate territory, which Harrison opposed.

In 1809, five years after Congress established the Michigan Territory, the St. Clair County settlers successfully petitioned Congress for the formation of a separate territory. Despite Harrison&#x27;s disapproval, Congress approved the formation of the Illinois Territory from the western portion of the Indiana Territory, in addition to granting the inhabitants of the Indiana Territory the right to elect a delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives and members of the territory&#x27;s Legislative Council (upper house). Harrison, whose political power was reduced by these changes, found himself at odds with the territorial legislature when the anti-slavery party came to power after the 1809 elections. Voters promptly rebuffed many of his plans for slavery, and in 1810 the territorial legislature repealed the indenturing laws that Harrison and the judicial court had enacted in 1803.

===Relocating the seat of government===
The capital of the Indiana Territory remained in Vincennes from 1800 to 1813, when the territorial legislature moved it to Corydon. After the Illinois Territory was formed from the western portion of the Indiana Territory in 1809, Vincennes, which was initially situated in the center of the territory, was now on its far west edge. The territorial legislature was also becoming increasingly fearful that the outbreak of the War of 1812 could cause an attack on Vincennes, resulting in their decision to move the seat of government to a location closer to the territory&#x27;s population center. In addition to Corydon, the towns of Madison, Lawrenceburg, Vevay, and Jeffersonville were considered as potential sites for the new capital. On March 11, 1813, the territorial legislature selected Corydon as the new seat of government for the territory, effective May 1, 1813.

Harrison favored Corydon, a town he had founded, named, and where he owned an estate. In 1813, after it was brought to the territorial legislature&#x27;s attention that plans were underway to construct a new county courthouse in Corydon and the new building could also be used for its assemblies (a significant cost savings), the government made the decision to relocate the territorial capital to Corydon. Construction on the capitol building began in 1814 and was nearly finished by 1816.

==History==
The area that became the Indiana Territory was once part of the Northwest Territory, which the Congress of the Confederation formed under the terms of the Northwest Ordinance on July 13, 1787. This ordinance outlined the basis for government in the western lands and also provided for an administrative structure to oversee the territory, including a three-stage process for transitioning from territory to statehood. In addition, the Land Ordinance of 1785 called for the U.S. government to survey the newly acquired territory for future sale and development. The Northwest Territory, which initially included land bounded by the Appalachian Mountains, Mississippi River, Great Lakes, and Ohio River, was subsequently partitioned into smaller territories that included the Indiana Territory (1800), Michigan Territory (1805), the Illinois Territory (1809), and eventually became the present-day states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and eastern Minnesota.

===Naming the new territory===
&quot;Indiana&quot;, meaning &quot;Land of the Indians&quot;, references the fact that most of the area north of the Ohio River was still inhabited by Native Americans.

Formal use of the word &quot;Indiana&quot; dates from 1768, when the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy reserved about of land in the present-day state of West Virginia and deeded it to a twenty-five-member Philadelphia-based trading company that engaged in trade with the native tribes in the Ohio River valley. The company named their land claim Indiana, in honor of its previous owners. In 1776 the land claim was transferred to the Indiana Land Company and offered for sale; however, the government of Virginia disputed the claim, arguing that it was the rightful owner because the land fell within its boundaries. The United States Supreme Court took up the case and extinguished the company&#x27;s right to the land in 1798. Two years later, Congress applied the Indiana Land Company&#x27;s name to the new territory.

===Western expansion and conflict===
Passage of the Land Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 committed the U.S. government to continued plans for western expansion. Increasing tensions with the Native Americans who occupied the western lands erupted into the Northwest Indian War. During the autumn of 1790, American forces under the command of General Josiah Harmar unsuccessfully pursued the Miami tribe near present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana, but had to retreat. In the meantime, Major Jean François Hamtramck led an expedition from Fort Knox to Wea, Potawatomi, and Kickapoo villages on the Wabash, Vermilion, and Eel Rivers, but his company lacked sufficient provisions to continue, forcing a return to Vincennes.

In 1791 Major General Arthur St. Clair, the governor of the Northwest Territory, commanded about 2,700 men in a campaign to establish a chain of forts and enforce peace in the area. In the early morning of November 3, 1791, nearly a 1,000 Miamis, Shawnees, Delawares, and other warriors under the leadership of Chief Little Turtle launched a surprise attack on the American camp near the Miami town of Kekionga, costing the Americans nearly nine hundred casualties and forcing the militia&#x27;s retreat. St. Clair&#x27;s defeat in 1791 remains the U.S. Army&#x27;s worst defeat by American Indians in history. Casualties included 623 federal soldiers killed and another 258 wounded; the Indian confederacy lost an estimated 100 men.

In August 1794, General &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne organized the Legion of the United States and defeated a Native American force at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The battle was a turning point for the Americans, who took control of the area near the strategically important Maumee–Wabash portage, as well as Fort Miami at Kekionga (rebuilt as Fort Wayne). In addition, several other forts were built in the territory to maintain American control of the area.

The Treaty of Greenville (1795) ended the Northwest Indian War and marked the beginning of a series of land cession treaties. Under the terms of this treaty, native tribes ceded southeastern Indiana and two-thirds of present-day Ohio to the U.S. government. As a result of the treaty, the Miamis considered themselves allies with the United States, and thousands of acres of newly ceded western lands attracted an increasing number of new settlers to what would become the Indiana Territory.

===Territory formation===
The U.S. Congress passed legislation to form the Indiana Territory on May 7, 1800, effective July 4, 1800. The new territory was established by dividing the Northwest Territory in advance of Ohio&#x27;s statehood. At the time the Indiana Territory was formed, the two main American settlements in what would later become the state of Indiana were at Vincennes and Clark&#x27;s Grant, while the settlement at Kaskaskia would later become a part of Illinois (but, because it is now west of the Mississippi River, is accessible only from Missouri.

President John Adams appointed William Henry Harrison as the first governor of the territory on May 13, 1800, but Harrison did not arrive in the territory to begin his duties as governor until January 10, 1801. John Gibson, the territorial secretary, served as acting governor until Harrison&#x27;s arrival at Vincennes.

A three-member panel of judges called the General Court assisted the territorial governor. Together they served as both the highest legislative and judicial authority in the territory. As governor of a territory of the first stage, which was outlined in the Northwest Ordinance, Harrison had wide-ranging powers in the new territory that included the authority to appoint all territorial officials and members of the territorial General Assembly. He also had the authority to divide the territory into districts.

Vincennes, the territory&#x27;s oldest settlement and among its largest with 714 townspeople in 1800, became its first territorial capital. The former French trading post was also one of the few white settlements in the territory. Indiana Territory began with four counties: Saint Clair and Randolph County, which became part of present-day Illinois; Knox in present-day Indiana; Wayne County, which became part of present-day Michigan. Governor Harrison formed Clark County, the first new county in the territory, out of the eastern portion of Knox County. Additional counties were established as the territory&#x27;s population increased. By 1810 the Indiana Territory&#x27;s enumerated population reached 24,520, even after the territory&#x27;s size had been reduced with formation of the Michigan Territory (1805) and Illinois Territory (1809). When the Indiana Territory petitioned for statehood in 1816, its population was spread among fifteen counties and exceeded 60,000 people, which was the minimum required for statehood under the terms of the Northwest Ordinance of 1796.

Because Harrison&#x27;s political fortunes were tied to Indiana&#x27;s rise to statehood, he was eager to expand the territory. In 1803 President Thomas Jefferson granted Harrison the authority to negotiate and conclude treaties with the Native American tribes in the territory. Harrison oversaw the establishment of thirteen treaties that ceded more than of land from Native American tribes, including most present-day southern Indiana, to the U.S. government.

The Treaty of Vincennes (1803) was the first of several treaties that Harrison negotiated as territorial governor. Leaders from local tribes signed this treaty to recognize Americans&#x27; possession of the Vincennes tract, an area that George Rogers Clark had captured from the British during the American Revolutionary War. The Treaty of Grouseland (1805) further secured the federal government&#x27;s possession of land in present-day south-central Indiana. After the signing of the contentious and disputed Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809), in which Harrison acquired for the U.S. government more than of land in what later became central Indiana and eastern Illinois, tensions between the Native American and settlers on the frontier neared the breaking the point.

The availability of low-cost federal land led to a rapid increase in the population of the territory, with thousands of new settlers entering the region every year. Large settlements began to spring up on the periphery of the territory around the Great Lakes, the Ohio River, the Wabash River, and the Mississippi River. Much of the interior, though, remained inhabited by the Native American tribes and was left unsettled.

===District of Louisiana===
While Native Americans continued to cede large tracts of land in the Indiana Territory to the federal government, the Americans also expanded their ownership of lands farther west as a result of the Louisiana Purchase agreement with France. From October 1, 1804, until July 4, 1805, administrative powers of the District of Louisiana were extended to the governor and judges of the Indiana Territory as a temporary measure to establish a civil government for the newly purchased lands. The district encompassed all of the Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 33rd parallel, which serves as the present-day border between the states of Arkansas and Louisiana.

Under the terms of the act establishing the district&#x27;s temporary government, Governor Harrison and the Indiana Territory&#x27;s judges enacted laws that extended to the Louisiana district. Local residents, who had previously lived under France&#x27;s civil law, objected to many of the provisions of the U.S. government, including their imposition of common law. The Indiana Territory&#x27;s temporary administration of the district of Louisiana lasted only nine months, until the Louisiana Territory was established, effective July 4, 1805, with its own territorial government.

One of the most notable events during the Indiana Territory&#x27;s administration of the District of Louisiana was the Treaty of St. Louis in which the Sac and Fox tribes ceded northeastern Missouri, northern Illinois, and southern Wisconsin to the United States. Resentments over this treaty later caused the native tribes to side with the British during the War of 1812 in raids along the Missouri, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers, and lead to their involvement in the Black Hawk War in 1832.

=== Tecumseh&#x27;s War ===


Ongoing tensions between the Native Americans and new settlers led to further hostilities between American forces and a pan-Indian confederacy. A resistance movement against U.S. expansion that developed around two Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet), became known as Tecumseh&#x27;s War. Tenskwatawa convinced members of native tribes that the Great Spirit would protect them from harm if they would rise up against the whites. He further encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to only pay white traders half of what they owed, and to give up all the white man&#x27;s ways, including their clothing, whiskey, and guns.

In 1810 Tecumseh and an estimated 400 armed warriors traveled to Vincennes, where he confronted Harrison and demanded that the governor rescind the Treaty of Fort Wayne. Harrison refused and the war party left peacefully, but Tecumseh was angry and threatened retaliation. Afterwards, Tecumseh journeyed south to meet with representatives of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a confederation of warriors to battle the Americans.

In 1811, while Tecumseh was still away, U.S. Secretary of War William Eustis authorized Harrison to march against the nascent confederation as a show of force. Harrison moved north with an army of more than 1,000 men in an attempt to intimidate the Shawnee into making peace. Early on the morning of November 6, tribal warriors launched a surprise attack on Harrison&#x27;s army. The ensuing battle became known as the Battle of Tippecanoe, where Harrison ultimately won his famous victory on November 7 at Prophetstown, along the Wabash and Tippecanoe Rivers. Harrison was publicly hailed as a national hero and the nickname of &quot;Old Tippecanoe,&quot; despite the fact that his troops had greatly outnumbered the Indian forces and had suffered many more casualties. After the battle, central Indiana was opened to further settlement by allowing more settlers to safely venture beyond the southern periphery of the territory.

===Movement toward statehood===
On December 5, 1804, Governor Harrison issued a proclamation announcing the Indiana Territory&#x27;s advancement to the semi-legislative phase of government. The territory&#x27;s voters elected members to its House of Representatives for the first time on January 3, 1805; the governor selected the five-member Legislative Council (upper house) from a list of candidates that the elected representatives provided. The first legislative session of the territorial general assembly met in Vincennes from July 29 through August 16, 1805, and chose Benjamin Parke as its first delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives.

Between 1805 and 1811 the northern portion of Indiana Territory was partitioned to establish Michigan Territory and the western portion of the territory set off to form the Illinois Territory. In addition, Governor Harrison negotiated a series of treaties with native tribes that ceded additional lands within the Indiana Territory to the federal government, opening millions of acres for sale and settlement in the present-day southern of Indiana and most of Illinois. In 1810 antislavery supporters in the territorial legislature also succeeded in repealing the 1805 indenture law.

In late December 1811 and early January 1812, Jonathan Jennings, who had become the territory&#x27;s first popularly-elected delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1810, presented the territorial legislature&#x27;s petition to the U.S. Congress that requested permission to draft a state constitution for Indiana in preparation for statehood. At that time the white population of the entire territory in 1810 was only 24,520, well below the threshold of 60,000 that the Northwest Ordinance required as a condition for statehood. Congress took no action on the petition, largely because of the outbreak of the War of 1812.

===War of 1812===
Tecumseh&#x27;s war with the Americans merged with the War of 1812 after the pan-Indian confederation allied with the British in Canada. In May 1812, Chief Little Turtle hosted a meeting of tribal leaders in the region in the Miami village of Mississinewa. Most of the tribes decided to remain neutral during the conflict and rejected Tecumseh&#x27;s plans of continued rebellion. Despite their rejection, Tecumseh continued to lead his dwindling army against the Americans, moving farther north so the British army could support them. Tecumseh&#x27;s followers who remained behind continued to raid the countryside and engaged in the Siege of Fort Harrison, which was the U.S. Army&#x27;s first land victory during the war. John Gibson served as acting governor of the territory during the War of 1812, while Harrison was leading the army. After Harrison resigned, Gibson continued as acting governor until Thomas Posey, the newly appointed governor, arrived in May 1813.

Other battles that occurred during the war within the boundaries of the present-day state of Indiana include the Siege of Fort Wayne, the Pigeon Roost Massacre and the Battle of the Mississinewa. Most of the territory&#x27;s native inhabitants remained passive throughout the war; however, numerous incidents between settlers and the native tribes led to the deaths of hundreds in the territory. The Treaty of Ghent (1814) ended the war and relieved American settlers from their fears of attack by the nearby British and their Indian allies.

===Achieving statehood===
Efforts to attain statehood for Indiana were revived in 1815, following a census made in 1814–15 that found the territory&#x27;s total population had reached 63,897. On February 1, 1815, a petition for statehood for Indiana was presented to the U.S. House of Representatives, but no immediate action was taken. Territorial legislature presented another petition to the U.S. House on December 28, 1815, and the U.S. Senate on January 2, 1816, prompting Jennings to introduce a bill to authorize the election of delegates to a constitutional convention to discuss statehood for Indiana.

There was considerable disagreement between Jennings and Posey on the subject of statehood. Posey, who thought it was too early to petition for statehood for Indiana, argued that a state government would pose a fiscal burden on its residents and there would not be sufficient candidates to fill all the new state offices. He also supported slavery, much to the chagrin of his opponents, including Jennings, Dennis Pennington, and others in the territorial legislature and who sought to use the bid for statehood to permanently end the possibility of slavery in Indiana. Posey&#x27;s fiscal concerns were valid. If Indiana became a state it would lose the federal government subsidies it received to operate the territorial government. To support the new state government expenses and to offset the loss of the federal government subsidies, additional taxes would have to be levied on residents. Supporters of statehood argued that the territory&#x27;s residents were willing and capable of electing government officials to run the state government and wanted to have representatives in Congress who could vote on their behalf.

On April 19, 1816, President James Madison approved an enabling act that the U.S. Congress passed on April 13. This act granted permission to convene a group of elected delegates tasked with drafting a state constitution, subject to the approval of U.S. Congress, that would establish the form of government for the new state. Elections of the forty-three delegates took place on May 13, 1816, and the constitutional convention assembled on June 10, 1816, in Corydon to begin their work. Convention delegates signed the state&#x27;s first constitution on June 29, 1816, which immediately went into effect.

Elections were held on August 5, 1816, to fill the offices of the new state government, including governor, lieutenant governor, a congressional representative, members of the Indiana General Assembly, and other offices. Jennings defeated Posey to become the first governor of Indiana; Christopher Harrison was elected the state&#x27;s first lieutenant governor; and William Hendricks was elected to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.

In November 1816 Congress approved the state constitution. The first session of the General Assembly for the state of Indiana convened on November 4, 1816. Jennings and Harrison were inaugurated on November 7, 1816. On the following day the state legislature elected James Noble and Waller Taylor to represent Indiana in the U.S. Senate. Hendricks, Noble, and Taylor were sworn into their congressional offices and took their seats in Congress in early December. The dissolution of the territorial government ended the existence of the Indiana Territory. On December 11, 1816, Madison signed the congressional resolution that formally admitted Indiana to the Union as the nineteenth state, and federal laws were formally extended to the new state on March 3, 1817.

==Commemoration==
The Indiana Territory is celebrated at an annual event in Corydon that is centered around the territorial capitol building. The festival includes actors in period dress who portray some of the early settlers and re-enact historical events. Other commemorative festivals occur in Vincennes and Madison.

The history of the period is also noted on historic markers and monuments across the former territory. For example, an Indiana Boundary Territory Line state historical marker, erected in 1999 in LaPorte County, commemorates the establishment of the Indiana Territory&#x27;s northern boundary when the Michigan Territory was formed.

<text>Frenzal Rhomb are an Australian punk rock band that formed in 1992 in Sydney. Though the band&#x27;s mainstream success has been minimal, four of the group&#x27;s albums have entered the top 20 on the ARIA Albums Chart: &quot;A Man&#x27;s Not a Camel&quot; (1999), &quot;Smoko at the Pet Food Factory&quot; (2011), &quot;Hi-Vis High Tea&quot; (2017) and &quot;The Cup of Pestilence&quot; (2023). &quot;Hi-Vis High Tea&quot; charted the highest of these, peaking at number nine in the charts. The group has also supported Australian tours by American punk bands such as The Offspring, Bad Religion, NOFX, The Lawrence Arms and Blink-182. Frenzal Rhomb have also toured in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, South Africa and Taiwan. The band has undergone several line-up changes, with lead vocalist Jason Whalley serving as the band&#x27;s sole constant member.

==History==
===1992–1995: Formation to &quot;Coughing Up a Storm&quot;===
Frenzal Rhomb formed in 1992 in the Sydney suburb of Newtown with Alexis &#x27;Lex&#x27; Feltham on bass guitar and Jason Whalley on vocals. Feltham and Whalley had been school mates at St Ives High School in St Ives. Whalley had commenced a Bachelor of Arts course in philosophy at Sydney University when he formed Frenzal Rhomb as a punk rock band. The band was formed to take part in a battle of the bands and at that stage was not seen as a permanent project. The name came from Fresnel rhomb, which is a prism-like device invented by the 19th century French engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel.

By 1993, the group&#x27;s line-up was Feltham, Whalley, Ben Costello on guitar and Karl Perske on drums. They played at the Sydney iteration of the Big Day Out in January.

In March 1994, the band issued a seven-track EP, &quot;Dick Sandwich&quot;. Its cover had &quot;a graphic drawing of the offending flaccid appendage draped over a sesame seed bun with lashings of bloody sauce.&quot; Posters with a similar image that advertised the group had them banned at some venues. National youth radio station Triple J criticised the group as being immature and told them to &quot;grow up&quot;. The EP was described as having &quot;good songs but it sounds like it was recorded under a doona&quot; and had the group banned from some radio stations and retail outlets. One of its tracks, &quot;I Wish I Was as Credible as Roger Climpson&quot; (aka &quot;Roger&quot;), attracted attention of its subject, Roger Climpson – a &quot;Seven News&quot; anchor on TV – who posed with the group for a photo. The E.P also features fan favourites &quot;Chemotherapy&quot;, and a cover of the TV series theme &quot;Home And Away&quot;. The E.P featured an alternate cover depicting rabbits on the flipside of the liftout to appease record stores or people who may have been offended by the original artwork. In October of that year, they released a single, &quot;Sorry About the Ruse&quot;, on their own label, How Much Did I Fucking Pay For This Records? The group were the local support act on the Australian leg of separate tours by United States punk rockers Bad Religion, The Offspring, and Blink-182.

In March 1995, Frenzal Rhomb released their first studio album, &quot;Coughing Up a Storm&quot;, on Shock Records&#x27; sub-label Shagpile Records. Perske was replaced by Nat Nykyruj on drums before the album appeared. The album features live fan favourite &quot;Genius&quot;. In October 1997, it was retitled &quot;Once a Jolly Swagman Always a Jolly Swagman&quot; and issued with additional tracks by the US label Liberation Records. In mid-1995, the group supported NOFX on their national tour. Fat Mike, a member of NOFX, was also the owner of Fat Wreck Chords, and he signed the band to his label, which released the &quot;4 Litres&quot; EP in the US.

===1996–2000: &quot;Not So Tough Now&quot; to &quot;A Man&#x27;s Not a Camel&quot;===
In July 1996, Frenzal Rhomb released their second album, &quot;Not So Tough Now&quot;, which was produced by Tony Cohen (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, TISM, Dave Graney), Kalju Tonuma (Nick Barker, The Mavis&#x27;s) and Frenzal Rhomb. Just after its appearance, Costello was replaced by Lindsay McDougall on lead guitar and backing vocals – Costello left to attend university and become an animal rights activist. In November, the group issued a CD EP, &quot;Punch in the Face&quot; and, in January 1997, performed at Big Day Out. Late that year they toured the US supporting Blink-182.

In September 1997, their third LP, &quot;Meet the Family&quot;, was released, which reached the top 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart and became their first certified gold album by ARIA. It spawned three singles, &quot;Mr Charisma&quot; (June), &quot;There&#x27;s Your Dad&quot; (September), and &quot;Mum Changed the Locks&quot; (April 1998). In April, Gordon &quot;Gordy&quot; Forman replaced Nykyruj on drums, and they toured Australia with US ska band Blue Meanies. Frenzal Rhomb were the head-liners for the Australian leg of the 1998 Vans Warped Tour and they were recruited for the US edition. A 1998 version of &quot;Meet the Family&quot; contained a bonus disc, &quot;Mongrel&quot;, that was recorded live on this US leg.

In March 1999, they released their next album, &quot;A Man&#x27;s Not a Camel&quot;, which was produced by Eddie Ashworth and was supported by a nationwide tour. As from November 2011, it remains Frenzal Rhomb&#x27;s highest-charting album, reaching No. 11. It spawned their highest-charting single, &quot;You Are Not My Friend&quot; (August), which reached No. 49. Allmusic&#x27;s album reviewer Mike DaRonco felt &quot;the first two songs are great in that catchy, playful pop-punk sort of way, but the rest ... fall under the trap of having all their tracks sounding like one big, long song&quot;. The album also features fan favourites &quot;We&#x27;re Going Out Tonight&quot; and &quot;Never Had So Much Fun&quot;.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999 in October, the group performed &quot;Never Had So Much Fun&quot;. In 2019 Dan Condon of Double J described this as one of &quot;7 great performances from the history of the ARIA Awards.&quot; According to the band&#x27;s website, US gigs were dropped after Whalley suffered a heart attack in late 1999 and the group spent the first few months of 2000 inactive. Whalley later denied that he had had a heart attack with &quot;a lot of things on our Web site are greatly exaggerated. There was also a thing about my having trench rot, the World War I disease, but that&#x27;s not true either&quot;.

===2000–2003: &quot;Shut Your Mouth&quot; to &quot;Sans Souci&quot;===
In November 2000, Frenzal Rhomb returned with the album &quot;Shut Your Mouth&quot;, released on Epic Records in Australia, an offshoot of Sony. RockZone&#x27;s Samuel Barker liked some tracks as &quot;a fine template for a pop punk album&quot; however &quot;the majority just falls into the same formula of most punk today. It&#x27;s not bad, just overplayed&quot;. The album peaked in the top 40. After six months, Sony dropped the band in mid-2001 and they signed with Epitaph Records in Australia.

In April 2002, Feltham left the group, which provided many stories about why he left, including one that he was fired after thinking that the group should incorporate synth and keyboard work. The last song he recorded with the band was a cover of Midnight Oil&#x27;s &quot;The Dead Heart&quot; for the 2001 tribute album &quot;Power &amp; The Passion: A Tribute to Midnight Oil&quot;. After holding auditions in Sydney, Tom Crease was announced as the new bass guitarist.

In April 2003, the band released &quot;Sans Souci&quot;, which appeared in the top 50. Jo-Ann Greene of Allmusic liked the group&#x27;s outlook: &quot;they&#x27;re not bitter, just snotty about it all, as all good punks should be. And Rhomb are four of the best ... their latest set of frenzied, funny, pitiless attacks upon an uncaring planet.&quot; The initial version of the album included a bonus DVD of five tracks with live footage and music videos.

===2004: Political protest, Jackie O===
During 2003, Frenzal Rhomb&#x27;s McDougall organised &quot;Rock Against Howard&quot;, a compilation album, by various Australian musicians as a protest against incumbent Prime Minister John Howard&#x27;s government. It was released in August 2004, before the October federal election, when Howard&#x27;s coalition was re-elected.

In July 2004, radio station 2Day FM presenter Jackie O was to MC at the Bassinthegrass festival in Darwin. Jackie allegedly arrived late, causing Frenzal Rhomb to cut their setlist short by several songs. She attempted to speak with the audience. In protest, McDougall began playing AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; over her voice. Jackie was upset that she was unable to finish her announcement to the audience. Whalley later accused her and other music industry personalities of pushing original Australian bands aside to make way for short-term marketable acts such as &quot;Australian Idol&quot; and &quot;Popstars&quot; contestants.

Jackie and her co-presenter, Kyle Sandilands, called Whalley on air during their next breakfast show. Whalley apologised for offending Jackie, but stood by his claims regarding the music industry. The conversation became heated as Sandilands told Whalley &quot;Your songs being played on this network or the Triple M network... it&#x27;s just not going to happen now&quot;; to which Whalley argued that Frenzal Rhomb were almost never played on the Austereo network anyway. During the conversation, Sandilands told Whalley that he was bitter and sad. When Whalley pointed out that Sandilands is in a position to promote new Australian music but doesn&#x27;t, Sandilands countered that Frenzal Rhomb is not played on the network &quot;because it&#x27;s pretty much shit&quot;. While Sandilands agreed that shows like Popstars and Australian Idol are interested in making &quot;a quick buck&quot;, he also asserted that he doesn&#x27;t &quot;care about Australian Idol or Popstars&quot;.

Sandilands argued that Whalley should not &quot;pick fights with people that are female in the Northern Territory&quot;. Sandilands asserted that if he himself were present, &quot;it would have been on for young and old&quot;. Whalley argued that gender was irrelevant to the issue, and in response to Sandilands&#x27; threat of violence asked Jackie if she was aware that her security guard had threatened a band technician with violence. Sandilands said he endorsed the threat of violence. Sandilands argued to Whalley that he has to &quot;get over it&quot; when Whalley recommended that radio DJs should promote original Australian music. In reply, Sandilands insinuated that Frenzal Rhomb, and bands in general, suffer from a lack of support because they are not &quot;putting [their] stuff in front of the right people&quot;.

ABC Television&#x27;s &quot;Media Watch&quot; covered the exchange and presenter David Marr raised concerns about the interview: &quot;Kyle and Jackie O are also part of a new generation of radio thugs&quot;. Patrick Joyce, general manager of Austereo in Sydney, responded to Sandilands&#x27; threats of black listing and violence, &quot;Music content is decided by the programming directors based on research of the market... Austereo does not approve of threats being made to anyone... We have fully canvassed these issues with Kyle&quot;.

===2005–2009: Jay and the Doctor and &quot;Forever Malcolm Young&quot;===

Frenzal Rhomb&#x27;s Whalley and McDougall worked as Jay and the Doctor on Triple J&#x27;s breakfast show from January 2005 through to November 2007. Prior to their employment at Triple J, the group&#x27;s music had been banned after they had earlier criticised the station on air for playing the &quot;same 40 songs&quot;. In 2004, they were asked to perform occasional late night shifts and request segments, which developed into the breakfast show slot. Their format includes banter where they provide &quot;quips, one-liners, slagging off each other, other bands, other breakfast announcers, listeners, Triple J, &quot;Australian Idol&quot; and St Ives. It&#x27;s verbal ping pong but more discursive.&quot;

The band released &quot;Forever Malcolm Young&quot; in October 2006 – the title is a conflated reference to the 1984 Alphaville song &quot;Forever Young&quot; and the name of AC/DC&#x27;s guitarist, Malcolm Young – which peaked in the top 40. It provided a minor radio hit with the title track. Some controversy was expressed over the profanity in the title and lyrics of &quot;Johnny Ramone was in a Fucking Good Band, but He Was a Cunt&quot; (see Johnny Ramone, Ramones). Whalley&#x27;s attitude to profanity and obscenity is &quot;I often get amazed how offended people get by language, especially in Australia when its nothing you wouldn&#x27;t hear in your local office or schoolyard. But we do make a point of shaking things up&quot;. Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll described them &quot;[their] history is littered with legendary stories, perhaps true, perhaps exaggerations, but stories which fuel and match their song and album titles. Their songs are often profane, likely to poke fun at someone including themselves, hint at a social conscience, and inside all the tough talk and body jokes be hopelessly romantic.&quot;

National touring followed the album&#x27;s release, along with the announcement that from November 2007 Whalley would be leaving both Frenzal Rhomb and his job at Triple J to go on a world trip with his girlfriend. Some later copies of &quot;Forever Malcolm Young&quot; contained a bonus DVD covering the band&#x27;s tours from 2002 up until 2005. It is titled &quot;Sucking All Over the World&quot;. Gordy Forman plays in the Melbourne hardcore band Mindsnare. McDougall continued as The Doctor at Triple J, initially with Robbie Buck and Marieke Hardy; and, from January 2010, he has hosted the afternoon show &quot;Drive with The Doctor&quot;. By April 2009, Frenzal Rhomb were performing The Boys Are Back in Town tour with 1990s punk group Nancy Vandal as their support act.

===2010–2017: &quot;Smoko at the Pet Food Factory&quot; and &quot;We Lived Like Kings...&quot;===

In December 2010, Frenzal Rhomb embarked on the No Sleep Til Festival which featured punk and metal bands: Megadeth, Descendents, NOFX, Gwar and Dropkick Murphys. Frenzal Rhomb played a new song entitled &quot;Bird Attack&quot;. In Brisbane, on the last stop of the tour, Whalley and Crease joined Descendents on-stage with other bands&#x27; singers – Al Barr (Dropkick Murphys), Fat Mike (NOFX), Matt Skiba and Derek Grant (Alkaline Trio), and Jason Allen (Descendents&#x27; road manager) – to perform &quot;Everything Sux&quot;.

Frenzal Rhomb recorded their next album, &quot;Smoko at the Pet Food Factory&quot; in Colorado with Bill Stevenson (drummer for Descendents) producing. It was released on 19 August 2011 on Shock Records, which peaked at No. 14. The group toured Australia with Teenage Bottlerocket in September in support of the album.

In June 2012, the album &#x27;Not So Tough Now&#x27; was certified gold by the Australia Record Industry Association, 16 years after its release.

Lead singer Jay Whalley announced on 26 February 2013 that the group was forced to cancel its recent tour after surgeons discovered and removed a pig tapeworm egg from his brain.

Drummer Gordy Foreman broke his arm in multiple places after stage diving during a performance in Perth in 2015 and spent about 18 months recovering. The band continued to play live with Kye Smith (of Local Resident Failure) filling in on drums. Smith had previously paid tribute to Frenzal Rhomb as part of his &quot;5 Minute Drum Chronology&quot; series on YouTube.

To celebrate the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary Frenzal Rhomb toured Australia in 2016. Fans were offered the opportunity to select songs in the set list by voting for their favourite songs on the band&#x27;s Facebook page. The band also released a best-of album, entitled &quot;We Lived Like Kings, We Did Anything We Wanted&quot;, on 19 August.

===2017–2023: &quot;Hi-Vis High Tea&quot;===
Frenzal Rhomb&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Hi-Vis High Tea&quot;, was released on 26 May 2017 on CD, LP (vinyl) and digital download. It was once again recorded in The Blasting Room by Bill Stevenson. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Cunt Act,&quot; was released on the same day; as well as a national run of dates with Totally Unicorn.

After 17 years, Tom Crease departed the band in mid-2019 due to ongoing hearing problems. He was replaced by Michael &quot;Dal&quot; Dallinger, formerly of Newcastle punk band Local Resident Failure – coincidentally, a band named after a Frenzal Rhomb song. The band then performed at the 2020 Hotter Than Hell festival, which ended up being their last shows for over a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The band made their live return at Melbourne&#x27;s 170 Russell on April 23, 2021. A national tour followed in May, including performances at the festivals Full Tilt and Spring Loaded.

===2023–present: &quot;The Cup of Pestilence&quot;===
In late 2022, the band confirmed that they were at work on an album. On 15 February 2023, the band announced their tenth studio album, &quot;The Cup of Pestilence&quot;, which was released on 7 April. The announcement came with the release of its opening track and lead single, &quot;Where Drug Dealers Take Their Kids&quot;. On 22 March 2023, Frenzal Rhomb released their second and last song from the album and single, &quot;Thought It Was Yoga But It Was Ketamine&quot;.

<text>This is a list of numbered highways in the province of Prince Edward Island.

== Arterial highways ==
Prince Edward Island relies mostly on arterial roads for major inter-city routes. The only expressway in the entire province is the Cornwall Bypass which is entirely part of Route 1 (there are no full-fledged freeways). Another section of highway in the province designated a limited access road is part of the Charlottetown Perimeter Highway, between Upton Road and St. Peters Rd. Maximum speed limit on arterial highways is typically .

== Collector highways ==
The province&#x27;s collector roads are paved all-weather roads, with a maximum speed limit of .

== Local routes ==
These are paved and unpaved local roads. The maximum speed limit 80 km/h (50 mph) but typical speed limits are 50–60 km/h (30-40 mph).

<text>Presidential elections were held in France on 23 April, with a second round on 7 May.

==Background==
The Socialist incumbent president François Mitterrand, who had been in office since 1981, did not stand for a third term. He was 78, had terminal cancer, and his party had lost the 1993 French legislative election in a landslide defeat. Since then, he had been &quot;cohabiting&quot; with a right-wing cabinet led by Prime Minister Édouard Balladur, a member of the neo-Gaullist RPR party. Balladur had promised the RPR leader, Jacques Chirac, that he would not run for the presidency, but as polls showed him doing well and he had the support of many right-wing politicians, he decided to run. The competition within the right between Balladur and Chirac was a major feature of the campaign.

Meanwhile, the left was weakened by scandals and disappointments regarding Mitterrand&#x27;s presidency along with the unemployment rate hovering around 10%. In June 1994, former Prime Minister Michel Rocard was dismissed as leader of the Socialist Party (PS) after the party&#x27;s poor showing in the European Parliament elections. Then, Jacques Delors decided not to stand as a candidate because he disagreed with the re-alignment on the left orchestrated by new party leader Henri Emmanuelli. This left the field wide open for numerous potential candidacies: among those who are known to have considered a run, or were strongly urged by others, are Jack Lang, Pierre Joxe, Laurent Fabius, Ségolène Royal and Robert Badinter. Former party leader and education minister Lionel Jospin was chosen by PS members as the party&#x27;s candidate in a primary election pitting him against Emmanuelli. He promised to restore the credibility and moral reputation of his party, but his chances of winning were seen as being thin. The economy was also still struggling with a depression which began in mid-1990, and the government&#x27;s policies were widely blamed for both the recession and its slow recovery.

The French Communist Party (PCF) tried to stop its electoral decline. Its new leader Robert Hue campaigned against &quot;king money&quot; and wanted to represent a renewed communism. He was faced with competition for the far left vote by the Trotskyist candidacy of Arlette Laguiller, who ran for the fourth time. Both of these candidates had a better result than their parties had in 1988, but came nowhere near being able to participate in the next round. In choosing Dominique Voynet, the Greens opted for their integration with the left.

On the far-right, Jean-Marie Le Pen tried to repeat his surprising result that he obtained in the 1988 presidential election. His main rival for the far-right vote was Philippe de Villiers, candidate of the eurosceptic parliamentary right. Both candidates primarily focused over the financial situation.

In January 1995, when he announced his candidacy, Balladur was the favourite of the political right. According to the SOFRES polls institute, he held an advantage of 14 points over Chirac (32% against 18% for the first round). He took advantage of his &quot;positive assessment&quot; as Prime Minister and advocated a moderately liberal economic policy. Chirac denounced the &quot;social fracture&quot; and criticised the &quot;dominant thought&quot;, targeting Balladur. Chirac argued that &quot;the pay slip is not the enemy of employment&quot;. Indeed, unemployment was the main theme of the campaign. From the start of March, Chirac gained ground on Balladur in the polls. 
Another factor that contributed to Balladur&#x27;s fall in popularity was the revelation of a bugging scandal which had implicated Balladur.

Chirac&#x27;s campaign slogan was &quot;La France pour tous&quot; (&quot;France for everyone&quot;); Balladur&#x27;s &quot;Believe in France&quot;; and Jospin&#x27;s &quot;A clear vote for a more just France&quot;.

==Opinion polls==
=== First round ===

==Results==
===First round===
Lionel Jospin won the first round, in what appeared to be an electoral recovery for the Socialist Party. His right-wing challenger for the runoff vote on 7 May was Jacques Chirac and not Edouard Balladur. Defeated, Balladur endorsed the RPR candidate. Jean-Marie Le Pen repeated his good result of the previous presidential election.

====By region====
===Second round===
During the TV debate between the two finalists, they disagreed about the presidential term. Jospin wanted to reduce it to five years whereas Chirac was in favour of the seven-year term. The PS candidate responded: &quot;The choice is five years with me or seven years with Jacques Chirac, which will be very long&quot;. Eventually, the presidential term was reduced to five years after the 2002 election.

Chirac was elected President and Balladur resigned as prime minister. Foreign minister Alain Juppé succeeded him.

<text>Knowledge engineering (KE) refers to all aspects involved in knowledge-based systems.

== Background ==
=== Expert systems===
One of the first examples of an expert system was MYCIN, an application to perform medical diagnosis. In the MYCIN example, the domain experts were medical doctors and the knowledge represented was their expertise in diagnosis.

Expert systems were first developed in artificial intelligence laboratories as an attempt to understand complex human decision making. Based on positive results from these initial prototypes, the technology was adopted by the US business community (and later worldwide) in the 1980s. The Stanford heuristic programming project led by Edward Feigenbaum was one of the leaders in defining and developing the first expert systems.

== History ==
In the earliest days of expert systems, there was little or no formal process for the creation of the software. Researchers just sat down with domain experts and started programming, often developing the required tools (e.g. inference engines) at the same time as the applications themselves. As expert systems moved from academic prototypes to deployed business systems it was realized that a methodology was required to bring predictability and control to the process of building the software. There were essentially two approaches that were attempted:

# Use conventional software development methodologies
# Develop special methodologies tuned to the requirements of building expert systems

Many of the early expert systems were developed by large consulting and system integration firms such as Andersen Consulting. These firms already had well tested conventional waterfall methodologies (e.g. Method/1 for Andersen) that they trained all their staff in and that were virtually always used to develop software for their clients. One trend in early expert systems development was to simply apply these waterfall methods to expert systems development.

Another issue with using conventional methods to develop expert systems was that due to the unprecedented nature of expert systems, they were one of the first applications to adopt rapid application development methods that feature iteration and prototyping as well as or instead of detailed analysis and design. In the 1980s few conventional software methods supported this type of approach.

The final issue with using conventional methods to develop expert systems was the need for knowledge acquisition. &quot;Knowledge acquisition&quot; refers to the process of gathering expert knowledge and capturing it in the form of rules and ontologies. Knowledge acquisition has special requirements beyond the conventional specification process used to capture most business requirements.

These issues led to the second approach to knowledge engineering: the development of custom methodologies specifically designed to build expert systems. One of the first and most popular of such methodologies custom designed for expert systems was the Knowledge Acquisition and Documentation Structuring (KADS) methodology developed in Europe. KADS had great success in Europe and was also used in the United States.

<doc id="458505" wikidata="Q1073015" url="?curid=458505" title="Domain name registrar">
<text>A domain name registrar is a company, person, or office that manages the reservation of Internet domain names.

A domain name registrar must be accredited by a generic top-level domain (gTLD) registry or a country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registry. A registrar operates in accordance with the guidelines of the designated domain name registries.

==History==
===Creation===

The need for a central authority to assign or administer domain names emerged from collaboration among computer network pioneers as they created the Domain Name System in the 1980s. In a 1982 draft Request for Comments (RFC), editor Jonathan Postel proposed a &quot;czar of domains.&quot; In her revisions of the draft, Jake Feinler crossed out &quot;czar&quot; and introduced the term &quot;registrar.&quot; She designated the DOD Network Information Center, of which she was the head, as the registrar of top-level domains.

This draft was published as RFC 819. The RFC standardized the naming system for computers on the internet, creating domain names. It specifies that &quot;associated with each domain there is a single person (or office) called the registrar.&quot;

The earliest domain names were names of organizations, such as .arpa for the Advanced Research Projects Agency. Feinler switched to a system of naming by generic categories, creating .mil, .gov, .org, .edu, and .com as generic top-level domain. This existed alongside a system of country code top-level domains administered by Postel. Eventually the role of registrar for each of the TLDs was delegated to various universities (the University of Dortmund for .de, Kuwait University for .kw, etc.) and, via US government contracts, to private companies.

===Commercialization===

As the internet expanded in the early 1990s, becoming more commercial and international, the US government decided it could no longer provide domain name management free of charge.

From 1991 to 1999, Network Solutions Inc. (NSI) operated the registries for the .com, .net, and .org top-level domains (TLDs). In addition to the function of domain name registry operator, it was also the sole registrar for these domains. However, several companies had developed independent registrar services. In 1996, one such company, Ivan Pope&#x27;s company, NetNames, developed the concept of a standalone commercial domain name registration service that would sell domain registration and other associated services to the public, effectively establishing the retail arm of an industry with the registries being the wholesalers. NSI assimilated this model, which ultimately led to the separation of registry and registrar functions.

In 1997, PGMedia filed an antitrust suit against NSI citing the DNS root zone as an essential facility, and the US National Science Foundation (NSF) was joined as a defendant in this action. Ultimately, NSI was granted immunity from antitrust litigation, but the litigation created enough pressure to restructure the domain name market.

In October 1998, following pressure from the growing domain name registration business and other interested parties, NSI&#x27;s agreement with the United States Department of Commerce was amended. This amendment required the creation of a shared registration system that supported multiple registrars. This system officially commenced service on November 30, 1999, under the supervision of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), although there had been several testbed registrars using the system since March 11, 1999. Since then, over 900 registrars have entered the market for domain name registration services.

Of the registrars who initially entered the market, many have continued to grow and outpace rivals. GoDaddy is the largest registrar. Other widely used registrars include Enom, Tucows, and Webcentral. Registrars who initially led the market but later were surpassed by rivals include Network Solutions and Dotster.

Each ICANN-accredited registrar must pay a fixed fee of US$4,000 plus a variable fee. The sum of variable registrar fees is intended to total US$3.8 million. The competition created by the shared registration system enables end users to choose from many registrars offering a range of related services at varying prices.

==Designated registrar==
Domain registration information is maintained by the domain name registries, which contract with domain registrars to provide registration services to the public. An end user selects a registrar to provide the registration service, and that registrar becomes the &quot;designated registrar&quot; for the domain chosen by the user.

Only the designated registrar may modify or delete information about domain names in a central registry database. It is not unusual for an end user to switch registrars, invoking a domain transfer process between the registrars involved, that is governed by specific domain name transfer policies.

When a registrar registers a .com domain name for an end-user, it must pay a maximum annual fee of US$9.59 and for .net the maximum price for one year is set at $9.92 to VeriSign, the registry operator for com, and a US$0.18 annual administration fee to ICANN. 

Many registrars also offer registration through reseller affiliates. An end-user either registers directly with a registrar, or indirectly through one or more layers of resellers. As of 2023, the retail cost generally ranges from a low of about $9.70 per year to about $35 per year for a simple com domain registration, although registrars often discount the price for a registration when ordered with other products such as web hosting services. The price for other gTLD registrations or renewals can vary.

The maximum period of registration for a gTLD domain name is 10 years. Some registrars offer longer periods of up to 100 years, but such offers involve the registrar renewing the registration for their customer every 10 years by themselves. If the registrar is de-accredited or goes out of business the domain name will be transferred to another accredited registrar. The full 100 year registration on such a transferred domain may not apply due to ICANN having a maximum of ten years for a registration.

==DNS hosting==

Registration of a domain name establishes a set of name server records in the DNS servers of the parent domain, indicating the IP addresses of DNS servers that are authoritative for the domain. This provides a reference for direct queries of domain data.

Registration of a domain does not automatically imply the provision of DNS services for the registered domain. Most registrars do offer DNS hosting as an optional free service for domains registered through them. If DNS services are not offered, or the end-user opts out, the end-user is responsible for procuring or self-hosting DNS services. Registrars require the specification of usually at least two name servers.

==DNSSEC support==

The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a suite of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifications for securing certain kinds of information provided by the Domain Name System. This involves a registrar processing public key data and creating DS records for addition into the parent zone. All new GTLD registries and registrars must support DNSSEC.

==Domain name transfer==
A domain name transfer is the process of changing the designated registrar of a domain name. ICANN has defined a &quot;Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars&quot;. The usual process of a domain name transfer is:
# The end user verifies that the whois admin contact info is correct, particularly the email address; obtains the authentication code (EPP or UDAI transfer code) from the old registrar, and removes any domain lock that has been placed on the registration. If the whois information had been out of date and is now updated, the end-user should wait 12–24 hours before proceeding further, to allow time for the updated data to propagate.
# The end user contacts the new registrar with the wish to transfer the domain name to their service, and supplies the authentication code.
# The gaining Registrar must obtain express authorization from either the Registered Name Holder or the Administrative Contact. A transfer may only proceed if confirmation of the transfer is received by the gaining Registrar from one of these contacts. The authorization must be made via a valid Standardized Form of Authorization, which may be sent e.g. by e-mail to the e-mail addresses listed in the WHOIS. The Registered Name Holder or the Administrative Contact must confirm the transfer. The new registrar starts electronically the transfer of the domain with the help of the authentication code (auth code).
# The old registrar will contact the end user to confirm the authenticity of this request. The end user may have to take further action with the old registrar, such as returning to the online management tools, to re-iterate their desire to proceed, in order to expedite the transfer.
# The old registrar will release authority to the new registrar.
# The new registrar will notify the end user of transfer completion. The new registrar may have automatically copied over the domain server information, and everything on the website will continue to work as before. Otherwise, the domain server information will need to be updated with the new registrar.

After this process, the new registrar is the domain name&#x27;s designated registrar. The process may take about five days. In some cases, the old registrar may intentionally delay the transfer as long as allowable. After transfer, the domain cannot be transferred again for 60 days, except back to the previous registrar.

If an attempt is made to transfer a domain immediately before it expires, a transfer can in some cases take up to 14 days, meaning that the transfer may not complete before the registration expires. This could result in loss of the domain name registration and failure of the transfer. To avoid this, end users could either transfer well before the expiration date, or renew the registration before attempting the transfer.

If a domain registration expires, irrespective of the reason, it can be difficult, expensive, or impossible for the original owner to get it back. After the expiration date, the domain status often passes through several management phases, often for a period of months; usually it does not simply become generally available.

===Transfer scams===
The introduction of a shared registry system opened up the previous domain registration monopoly to new entities known as registrars, which were qualified by ICANN to do business. Many registrars had to compete with each other, and although some companies offered value added services or used viral marketing, others, such as VeriSign and the Domain Registry of America attempted to trick customers to switch from their current registrar using a practice known as domain slamming.

Many of these transfer scams involve a notice sent in the mail, fax, or e-mail. Some scammers contact end-users by telephone (because the contact information is available through WHOIS) to obtain more information. These notices would include information publicly available from the WHOIS database to add to the look of authenticity. The text would include legalese to confuse the end user into thinking that it is an official binding notice. Scam registrars go after domain names that are expiring soon or have recently expired. Domain name expiry dates are readily available via WHOIS.

==Drop catcher==

A &quot;drop catcher&quot; is a domain name registrar that offers the service of attempting to quickly register a given domain name for a customer if that name becomes available—that is, to &quot;catch&quot; a &quot;dropped&quot; name—when the domain name&#x27;s registration expires and is then deleted, either because the registrant abandons the domain or because the registrant did not renew the registration prior to deletion.

==Registrar rankings==
Several organizations post market-share-ranked lists of domain name registrars and numbers of domains registered at each. The published lists differ in which top-level domains (TLDs) they use; in the frequency of updates; and in whether their basic data is absolute numbers provided by registries, or daily changes derived from zone files.

The lists appear to all use at most 16 publicly available generic TLDs (gTLDs) that existed as of December 2009, plus .us. A February 2010 ICANN &quot;zone file access concept paper&quot; explains that most country code TLD (ccTLD) registries stopped providing zone files in 2003, citing abuse.

Published rankings and reports include:

* Monthly (but with approximately a three-month delay), ICANN posts registry reports created by the registries of all gTLDs. These reports list absolute numbers of domains registered with each ICANN-accredited registrar.
* Yearly (but covering only the period from 2002 to 2007), DomainTools.com, operated by Name Intelligence, Inc., published registrar statistics. Totals included .com, .net, .org, .info, .biz and .us. It cited &quot;daily changes&quot; (presumably from daily zone files) as the basis for its yearly aggregates.

== ICANN registrar accreditation ==

ICANN registrar accreditation is a process established by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to ensure that gTLD domain registrars meet specific standards and requirements in providing gTLD domain registration services. The country code ccTLDs typically have their own registrar accreditation processes.

To become an ICANN-accredited domain registrar, companies must undergo a comprehensive and rigorous application process.

The application fee for ICANN Accreditation as of April 12, 2021, is $3,500 which is non-refundable. In addition, registrars are required to provide documentation confirming that they possess access to a minimum working capital of $70,000 at the time of application.

<text>Interstate 280 (I-280) is a major north–south auxiliary Interstate Highway in the San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California. It runs from I-680 and US Route 101 (US 101) in San Jose to King and 5th streets in San Francisco, running just to the west of the larger cities of San Francisco Peninsula for most of its route.

From I-880 in San Jose to State Route 1 (SR 1) in Daly City, I-280 was built and dedicated as the Junipero Serra Freeway, after the Spanish Franciscan friar who founded the first nine of 21 Spanish missions in California from San Diego to San Francisco. One of the dedication signs (in Daly City) still indicates that the &quot;Junipero Serra Freeway&quot; is known as the &quot;World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Freeway&quot; due to its scenic route through the San Francisco Peninsula. From SR 1 to the James Lick Freeway (US 101) in San Francisco it is officially called the John F. Foran Freeway (after a former member of the California State Legislature). From the James Lick Freeway to its northern end at King and 5th streets, I-280 is called the Southern-Embarcadero Freeway.

I-280 is one of two auxiliary Interstate designations to appear on opposite coasts of the United States. I-110 in California and Florida is the only other designation.

I-280 was formerly shown on the app icon for Apple&#x27;s iOS and macOS built-in Apple Maps. This is because the highway goes through Cupertino, the home of Apple&#x27;s headquarters.

==Route description== 

The southern end of I-280 is at the Joe Colla Interchange with US 101 in San Jose, where it acts as a continuation of I-680 westward. In between San Jose and San Francisco, I-280 passes through Santa Clara, Cupertino, Los Altos, and Los Altos Hills before it settles along its scenic route just to the west of the cities of the San Francisco Peninsula in San Mateo County and just to the east of the Santa Cruz Mountains. I-280 reemerges in a decidedly urbanized area in the city of San Bruno, passing through South San Francisco and Daly City before it runs across a southeastern swath of the city of San Francisco on the way to its northern terminus.

The segment of the Junipero Serra Freeway between Cupertino (SR 85) and Daly City (SR 1) has been called the &quot;World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Freeway&quot; since its dedication in the 1960s. Drivers along this portion of I-280 are treated to scenic views of the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west and, at a few points, San Francisco Bay to the east and are isolated by hills from the cities to the east. Through much of this segment, the freeway is actually running just inside the eastern rim of the rift valley of the San Andreas Fault. A particularly attractive stretch of the freeway from Hillsborough to Belmont provides a view at Crystal Springs Reservoir, formed by water piped over from Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park, partly filling the rift valley. The waters are impounded by Crystal Springs Dam, which drains into San Francisco Bay via San Mateo Creek; I-280 crosses the deep valley formed by this creek on the Doran Memorial Bridge, completed in 1969.
For nearly all of its length, I-280 runs roughly parallel and several miles to the west of US 101 (Bayshore Freeway). Both freeways are north–south routes connecting San Jose with San Francisco; however, unlike I-280, the route that US 101 takes between the two cities goes entirely through urbanized areas. The vast majority of the population of the San Francisco Peninsula lives somewhere between I-280 and US 101.

I-280 does not currently intersect with I-80, its parent Interstate, although it was originally intended to do so. The northern terminus of I-280 is now within about of I-80&#x27;s western terminus (at the interchange with US 101), but the two Interstates do not directly connect; instead, I-280 complies with numbering conventions by virtue of its interchanges with the southern ends of I-680 and I-880, both of which connect to I-80 at their northern terminuses. Although San Francisco planned and has had several opportunities to connect I-280 to I-80, it has chosen to use the money for other purposes. Instead, I-280&#x27;s northernmost extension, which includes a significant double-deck section (with northbound traffic on the lower deck and southbound traffic on the upper), primarily functions now as a spur into the Financial District, San Francisco, as suggested by signage on northbound US 101 at the Alemany Maze.

Major intersections include US 101 and SR 1 in San Francisco, I-380 in San Bruno, SR 92 in San Mateo, SR 85 in Cupertino, and I-880 and I-680 and US 101 in San Jose.

I-280 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). I-280 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System and, from the San Mateo–Santa Clara county line to the San Bruno city limits, is officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a &quot;memorable landscape&quot; with no &quot;visual intrusions&quot;, where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. The Junipero Serra Freeway is the name of I-280 from SR 1 in San Francisco to SR 17, as named by Assembly Concurrent Resolution 140, Chapter 208 in 1967, in honor of Spanish missionary Junípero Serra, who founded many of California&#x27;s missions in the 18th century. I-280 from its southern terminus at US 101 and I-680 north to I-880 in San Jose is part of the Sinclair Freeway (named after Joseph P. Sinclair, District Engineer for District 4 California Division of Highways). A high faux-sandstone statue of Father Serra kneeling and pointing over the freeway is located at a highway rest area just north of the SR 92 intersection between the Bunker Hill Drive and Black Mountain Road exits on northbound I-280 in Hillsborough and can be clearly seen by drivers in both directions.

==History==
I-280 was added to the Interstate Highway System on September 15, 1955, as a route from San Jose north to San Francisco. This ran along the present alignment of I-280 south of San Francisco, but, in San Francisco, it was instead intended to run north parallel to SR 1, past the planned west end of I-80 which would have been at the junction with the Panhandle Freeway just south of Fulton and Park Presidio, along what would have been the Park Presidio Freeway north to the south approach to the Golden Gate Bridge. At that point, I-280 would have met I-480 (Embarcadero Freeway), which would have headed east on Doyle Drive (US 101), the Golden Gate Freeway, and onto the Embarcadero Freeway to reach the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. I-480 would have continued south on the never-built section of the Southern-Embarcadero Freeway from Folsom and the Embarcadero to 5th and King streets, then along the present Southern-Embarcadero Freeway to meet the Southern Freeway (now I-280) near the Alemany Maze, which served as the US 101 Bypass until I-280 was built. The I-280 number was approved on November 10, 1958.

In the 1964 renumbering, I-280&#x27;s legislative designation was officially applied to the planned route. This replaced SR 1 in San Francisco; the new SR 1 alignment turned northeast where I-280 now runs, quickly ending at SR 82 (San Jose Avenue/Alemany Boulevard). SR 1, however, continued to be signed along its former (and current) alignment, which had not been upgraded to freeway standards.

A realignment approved January 1968 primarily took I-280&#x27;s legislative definition onto its current route. This new routing ran along what had been SR 1, SR 82, SR 87, and I-480 (downgraded to SR 480 then), ending at I-80 at the western Bay Bridge approach. This change was made on the state level in 1968, restoring SR 1 to its current alignment and truncating SR 82, SR 87 and SR 480.

For the scenic portion, the section of I-280 between SR 85 (Cupertino) and SR 84 (Woodside) was completed in the late 1960s alongside SR 85. The section between SR 92 (San Mateo) and SR 84 was not completed until the 1970s. Until then, traffic was routed on Cañada Road between the two ends.

A direct freeway connection between I-280 and I-80 was never completed. I-280 was planned to run along The Embarcadero underneath the Bay Bridge approach/I-80 to connect to SR 480 and then loop back to the Bay Bridge approach/I-80 near 1st Street. However, the segment of I-280 between 3rd Street and SR 480 was never built. This left I-280 terminating in midair at 3rd Street, along with ramp stubs at 5th Street that were intended to connect to the second proposed location of a parallel bay bridge (which was also never built). This also caused the completed freeway segment from the Bay Bridge approach/I-80 near 1st Street to The Embarcadero to be signed as part of SR 480 instead of I-280. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, plans to connect I-280 to I-80 were formally abandoned, the earthquake-damaged Embarcadero Freeway was torn down in 1991, and the northern terminus of I-280 was reconfigured to the present-day King Street on/offramps in 1997.

The interchange at the beginning of I-280 at I-680 and US 101 in San Jose was constructed years before its completion. The three flyovers, with no connecting ramps, stood as a monument to inefficiency for years in the 1970s, becoming the butt of local jokes. The highlight prank occurred in January 1976, when a 1960 Chevrolet Impala was placed on the highest bridge overnight, where it obviously would be impossible to drive. The following day, San Jose City Councilmember Joe Colla was photographed standing next to the car, an image that was circulated across many newspapers. It has been suggested this stunt nudged the state of California to find the funds to complete the freeway. The ramps opened five years later in 1981. In 2010, a resolution was introduced in the state legislature to name it the Joe Colla Interchange in memory of the late councilmember.

In 2021, University of California, Davis, researchers published a report on wildlife-vehicle collisions based on California Highway Patrol and insurance data over the past five years, according to which five of the 20 stretches of highway in the state with the highest costs for this reason are on I-280, the worst being between San Bruno and Cupertino.

<text>Roger North, KC (3 September 16531 March 1734) was an English lawyer, biographer, and amateur musician.

==Life==

North was the sixth son of Dudley North, 4th Baron North, and his wife Anne Montagu and was the brother of Francis North, Elizabeth (became) Wiseman and Dudley North. He was born in Tostock, Suffolk. He attended Bury St Edmunds Grammar School and then Thetford Grammar School from 1663, followed by Jesus College, Cambridge, and the Middle Temple. He was called to the bar in 1674, and was Steward of the Diocese of Canterbury in 1678. He became King&#x27;s Counsel and a Bencher of Middle Temple in 1682.

North developed a good practice at the bar, helped by his elder brother Francis who became Lord Chancellor. Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon, called him &quot;one of only two honest lawyers I ever knew&quot;. During the Popish Plot, while Francis succumbed to the prevailing anti-Catholic hysteria, Roger remained detached and sceptical. Although he was always loyal to his brother&#x27;s memory, Roger admitted that during the Plot &quot;wise men behaved like stark fools&quot;. In 1684 he became Solicitor-General to the Duke of York. After this his career suffered something of a check: Francis&#x27; unexpected early death in September 1685 was both a personal loss and a blow to Roger&#x27;s career, since Francis was replaced as Lord Chancellor by the formidable Lord Jeffreys. Roger, who left a scarifying picture of Jeffreys in his memoirs, was a rather shy and diffident man, and frankly admitted to being terrified of Jeffreys; as a result, in his own words, his practice &quot;declined so as to be scarce worth attending Court&quot;. The check was only temporary: in 1685, he was chosen as a Tory Member of Parliament for Dunwich, and became Recorder of Bristol. He was further advanced in 1686 to the office of Attorney General to Queen Mary of Modena. In 1686 his sister Elizabeth Wiseman was involved in a dispute. She was a rich widow and their brother Charles North had tried to marry her off to his chosen candidate, Robert Spencer. Elizabeth asked for help and three of her brothers including Roger came to her aid. This case is very well documented as Roger gathered together all the letters. There was a case at the Court of Arches and Robert and Charles were required to recant their version of the events.

The Glorious Revolution stopped his advancement, and he retired to his estate of Rougham in Norfolk and increased his fortune by marrying the daughter of Sir Robert Gayer.

North died at Rougham on 1 March 1734, leaving a family from whom the Norths of Rougham were descended.

==Works==
North collected books, and was constantly occupied in writing, but he is best known for his &quot;Lives of the Norths&quot;, published after his death, together with his own autobiography (edition in Bohn&#x27;s Standard Library, 1890, by Augustus Jessopp), an authority for the period. His comments on musical performance practice, in particular, have proven helpful for musicologists researching the Baroque style in England. In addition to his writing on performance practice, he wrote on musical aesthetics, pedagogy, and tuning and temperament; one of his most important achievements in this regard was devising a practical and detailed system for mean-tone tuning in the age before equal temperament. Another well-known work is &quot;Examen&quot;, a defence of Charles II&#x27;s record as a ruler. He was also a learned connoisseur of architecture and designed a new gateway for the Middle Temple in London and a Palladian extension to his house at Rougham.

==Family==
North married Mary, the daughter of Sir Robert Gayer of Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire and his first wife Mary Rich, daughter of Sir Thomas Rich, 1st Baronet, with whom he had two sons and five daughters. Notable descendants include Marianne North, the botanical illustrator, and Frederick North, a Liberal politician.

<text>Dudley North, 4th Baron North, KB (160224 June 1677) of Kirtling Tower, Cambridgeshire was an English politician, who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1628 and 1660.

==Life==
North was the elder son of Dudley North, 3rd Baron North, and his wife Frances Brockett, daughter of Sir John Brocket of Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire. In 1616 he was created a Knight of the Bath. He was admitted to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1619 and to Gray&#x27;s Inn in August 1619. In 1620 he joined the volunteer regiment for the relief of the Electoral Palatinate and served in Holland during the Dutch–Portuguese War. He travelled in Italy, France and Spain. In 1628 he was elected member of parliament for Horsham and sat until 1629, when Charles I of England decided to rule without parliament for eleven years.

North was then elected, in April 1640, as MP for Cambridgeshire in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected to the seat in November 1640, in the Long Parliament, and ultimately in 1660, to the Convention Parliament, after the Restoration of the monarchy. On the death of his father in January 1667 he succeeded to the title Baron North.
North was an accomplished, studious man, who wrote on economic and religious subjects. Among his publications were &quot;Passages relating to the Long Parliament&quot;, of which he had himself been a member, and &quot;Observations and Advices Oeconomical&quot;. He also wrote poetry for private consumption.
North died in 1677 and was buried at Kirtling, Cambridgeshire, on 27 June 1677.

==Family==
North married Anne Montagu, daughter of Sir Charles Montagu of Boughton House and his wife Mary Whitmore, and brother of Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, so increasing the family fortune. They had 14 children. His eldest son, Charles (c. 1636–1691), was created Baron Grey of Rolleston during his father&#x27;s life and succeeded his father as 5th Baron North. His third son, Francis North, became Lord Chancellor as Lord Guilford. His fourth son was Sir Dudley North, the economist. His fifth son was John North (1645–1683), master of Trinity College, Cambridge, and professor of Greek in the university. His sixth son was Roger North, the lawyer and historian. One of his daughters, Mary, married Sir William Spring MP, and another, Jane Bridget, married William Henry Moss. Elizabeth, his 3rd surviving daughter married twice including as Elizabeth Wiseman; she was a noted litigant. His granddaughter Dudleya North was an orientalist, linguist and classical scholar.

<text>EMV is a payment method based on a technical standard for smart payment cards and for payment terminals and automated teller machines which can accept them. EMV stands for &quot;Europay, Mastercard, and Visa&quot;, the three companies that created the standard.

EMV cards are smart cards, also called chip cards, integrated circuit cards, or IC cards, which store their data on integrated circuit chips, in addition to magnetic stripes for backward compatibility. These include cards that must be physically inserted or &quot;dipped&quot; into a reader, as well as contactless cards that can be read over a short distance using near-field communication technology. Payment cards which comply with the EMV standard are often called chip and PIN or chip and signature cards, depending on the authentication methods employed by the card issuer, such as a personal identification number (PIN) or electronic signature. Standards exist, based on ISO/IEC 7816, for contact cards, and based on ISO/IEC 14443 for contactless cards (Mastercard Contactless, Visa PayWave, American Express ExpressPay).

== History ==
Until the introduction of chip &amp; PIN, all face-to-face credit or debit card transactions involved the use of a magnetic stripe or mechanical imprint to read and record account data, and a signature for purposes of identity verification. The customer hands their card to the cashier at the point of sale who then passes the card through a magnetic reader or makes an imprint from the raised text of the card. In the former case, the system verifies account details and prints a slip for the customer to sign. In the case of a mechanical imprint, the transaction details are filled in, a list of stolen numbers is consulted, and the customer signs the imprinted slip. In both cases the cashier must verify that the customer&#x27;s signature matches that on the back of the card to authenticate the transaction.

Using the signature on the card as a verification method has a number of security flaws, the most obvious being the relative ease with which cards may go missing before their legitimate owners can sign them. Another involves the erasure and replacement of legitimate signature, and yet another involves the forgery of the correct signature.

The invention of the silicon integrated circuit chip in 1959 led to the idea of incorporating it onto a plastic smart card in the late 1960s by two German engineers, Helmut Gröttrup and Jürgen Dethloff. The earliest smart cards were introduced as calling cards in the 1970s, before later being adapted for use as payment cards. Smart cards have since used MOS integrated circuit chips, along with MOS memory technologies such as flash memory and EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory).

The first standard for smart payment cards was the Carte Bancaire B0M4 from Bull-CP8 deployed in France in 1986, followed by the B4B0&#x27; (compatible with the M4) deployed in 1989. Geldkarte in Germany also predates EMV. EMV was designed to allow cards and terminals to be backwardly compatible with these standards. France has since migrated all its card and terminal infrastructure to EMV.

EMV stands for Europay, Mastercard, and Visa, the three companies that created the standard. The standard is now managed by EMVCo, a consortium with control split equally among Visa, Mastercard, JCB, American Express, China UnionPay, and Discover. EMVCo accepts public comment on its draft standards and processes, but also allows other organizations to become &quot;Associates&quot; and &quot;Subscribers&quot; for deeper collaboration. JCB joined the consortium in February 2009, China UnionPay in May 2013, and Discover in September 2013. 

The top vendors of EMV cards and chips are: ABnote (American Bank Corp), CPI Card Group, IDEMIA (from the merger of Oberthur Technologies and Safran Identity &amp; Security (Morpho) in 2017), Gemalto (acquired by the Thales Group in 2019) Giesecke &amp; Devrient and Versatile Card Technology.

==Differences and benefits==
There are two major benefits to moving to smart-card-based credit card payment systems: improved security (with associated fraud reduction), and the possibility for finer control of &quot;offline&quot; credit-card transaction approvals. One of the original goals of EMV was to provide for multiple applications on a card: for a credit and debit card application or an e-purse. Beginning in 2013, new-issue debit cards in the US contain two applications — a card association (Visa, Mastercard etc.) application, and a common debit application.

EMV chip card transactions improve security against fraud compared to magnetic stripe card transactions that rely on the holder&#x27;s signature and visual inspection of the card to check for features such as hologram. The use of a PIN and cryptographic algorithms such as Triple DES, RSA and SHA provide authentication of the card to the processing terminal and the card issuer&#x27;s host system. The processing time is comparable to online transactions, in which communications delay accounts for the majority of the time, while cryptographic operations at the terminal take comparatively little time. The supposed increased protection from fraud has allowed banks and credit card issuers to establish a &quot;liability shift&quot;, such that merchants are liable (as of 1 January 2005 in the EU region and 1 October 2015 in the US) for any fraud that results from transactions on systems that are not EMV-capable. The majority of implementations of EMV cards and terminals confirm the identity of the cardholder by requiring the entry of a personal identification number (PIN) rather than signing a paper receipt. Whether or not PIN authentication takes place depends upon the capabilities of the terminal and programming of the card.

When credit cards were first introduced, merchants used mechanical rather than magnetic portable card imprinters that required carbon paper to make an imprint. They did not communicate electronically with the card issuer, and the card never left the customer&#x27;s sight. The merchant had to verify transactions over a certain currency limit by telephoning the card issuer. During the 1970s in the United States, many merchants subscribed to a regularly-updated list of stolen or otherwise invalid credit card numbers. This list was commonly printed in booklet form on newsprint, in numerical order, much like a slender phone book, yet without any data aside from the list of invalid numbers. Checkout cashiers were expected to thumb through this booklet each and every time a credit card was presented for payment of any amount, prior to approving the transaction, which incurred a short delay.

Later , terminal equipment at the merchant electronically contacted the card issuer, using information from the magnetic stripe to verify the card and authorize the transaction. This was much faster, but required the transaction to occur in a fixed location. Consequently, if the transaction did not take place near a terminal (in a restaurant, for example) the clerk or waiter had to take the card away from the customer and to the card machine. It was easily possible for a dishonest employee to swipe the card surreptitiously through a cheap machine that instantly recorded the information on the card and stripe; in fact, even at the terminal, a thief could bend down in front of the customer and swipe the card on a hidden reader. This made illegal cloning of cards relatively easy and a more common occurrence than before.

Since the introduction of payment card chip and PIN, cloning of the chip is not feasible; only the magnetic stripe can be copied, and a copied card cannot be used by itself on a terminal requiring a PIN. The introduction of chip and PIN coincided with wireless data transmission technology becoming inexpensive and widespread. In addition to mobile-phone-based magnetic readers, merchant personnel can now bring wireless PIN pads to the customer, so the card is never out of the cardholder&#x27;s sight. Thus, both chip and PIN and wireless technologies can be used to reduce the risks of unauthorized swiping and card cloning.

==Chip and PIN vis-à-vis chip and signature==
Chip and PIN is one of the two verification methods that EMV enabled cards can employ. Rather than physically signing a receipt for identification purposes, the user enters a personal identification number (PIN), typically of four to six digits in length. This number must correspond to the information stored on the chip or PIN at Host. Chip and PIN technology makes it much harder for fraudsters to use a found card, inasmuch as if someone steals a card, they are unable to make fraudulent purchases unless they know the PIN.

Chip and signature, on the other hand, differentiates itself from chip and PIN by verifying a consumer&#x27;s identity with a signature.

As of 2015, chip and PIN cards are common in most European countries (e.g., the UK, Ireland, France, Portugal, Finland and the Netherlands) as well as in Pakistan, Iran, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Chip and signature cards are more common in the US, Mexico, parts of South America (such as Argentina and Peru) and some Asian countries (such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Singapore, and Indonesia). 
==Online, phone, and mail order transactions==
While EMV technology has helped reduce crime at the point of sale, fraudulent transactions have shifted to more vulnerable telephone, Internet, and mail order transactions—known in the industry as card-not-present or CNP transactions. CNP transactions made up at least 50% of all credit card fraud. Because of physical distance, it is not possible for the merchant to present a keypad to the customer in these cases, so alternatives have been devised, including

* Software approaches for online transactions that involve interaction with the card-issuing bank or network&#x27;s website, such as Verified by Visa and Mastercard SecureCode (implementations of Visa&#x27;s 3-D Secure protocol). 3-D Secure is now being replaced by Strong Customer Authentication as defined in the European Second Payment Services Directive.
* Creating a one-time virtual card linked to a physical card with a given maximum amount.
* Additional hardware with keypad and screen that can produce a one-time password, such as the Chip Authentication Program.
* Keypad and screen integrated into complex cards to produce a one-time password. Since 2008, Visa has been running pilot projects using the Emue card where the generated number replaces the code printed on the back of standard cards.

As for which is faster, &quot;The New York Times&quot; explained that it&#x27;s a matter of perception: While the chip method requires that the chip stay in the machine until the transaction and the authorization process is completed, the phone swipe method does the authorization in the background; a receipt starts coming out right away.

==Commands==
ISO/IEC 7816-3 defines the transmission protocol between chip cards and readers. Using this protocol, data is exchanged in &quot;application protocol data units&quot; (APDUs). This comprises sending a command to a card, the card processing it, and sending a response. EMV uses the following commands:

* application block
* application unblock
* card block
* external authenticate (7816-4)
* generate application cryptogram
* get data (7816-4)
* get processing options
* internal authenticate (7816-4)
* PIN change / unblock
* read record (7816-4)
* select (7816-4)
* verify (7816-4).

Commands followed by &quot;7816-4&quot; are defined in ISO/IEC 7816-4 and are interindustry commands used for many chip card applications such as GSM SIM cards.

==Transaction flow==
An EMV transaction has the following steps:

#Application selection
#Initiate application processing
#Read application data
#Processing restrictions
#Offline data authentication
#Certificates
#Cardholder verification
#Terminal risk management
#Terminal action analysis
#First card action analysis
#Online transaction authorization (only carried out if required by the result of the previous steps; mandatory in ATMs)
#Second card action analysis
#Issuer script processing

== Application selection ==
ISO/IEC 7816 defines a process for application selection. The intent of application selection was to let cards contain completely different applications—for example GSM and EMV. However, EMV developers implemented application selection as a way of identifying the type of product, so that all product issuers (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) must have their own application. The way application selection is prescribed in EMV is a frequent source of interoperability problems between cards and terminals. Book 1 of the EMV standard devotes 15 pages to describing the application selection process.

An &quot;application identifier&quot; (AID) is used to address an application in the card or Host Card Emulation (HCE) if delivered without a card. An AID consists of a &quot;registered application provider identifier&quot; (RID) of five bytes, which is issued by the ISO/IEC 7816-5 registration authority. This is followed by a &quot;proprietary application identifier extension&quot; (PIX), which enables the application provider to differentiate among the different applications offered. The AID is printed on all EMV cardholder receipts. Card issuers can alter the application name from the name of the card network.

List of applications:
===Initiate application processing===
The terminal sends the &quot;get processing options&quot; command to the card. When issuing this command, the terminal supplies the card with any data elements requested by the card in the &quot;processing options data objects list&quot; (PDOL). The PDOL (a list of tags and lengths of data elements) is optionally provided by the card to the terminal during application selection. The card responds with the &quot;application interchange profile&quot; (AIP), a list of functions to perform in processing the transaction. The card also provides the &quot;application file locator&quot; (AFL), a list of files and records that the terminal needs to read from the card.

===Read application data===
Smart cards store data in files. The AFL contains the files that contain EMV data. These all must be read using the read record command. EMV does not specify which files data is stored in, so all the files must be read. Data in these files is stored in BER TLV format. EMV defines tag values for all data used in card processing.

===Processing restrictions===
The purpose of the &quot;processing restrictions&quot; is to see if the card should be used. Three data elements read in the previous step are checked: Application version number, Application usage control (this shows whether the card is only for domestic use, etc.), Application effective/expiration dates checking.

If any of these checks fails, the card is not necessarily declined. The terminal sets the appropriate bit in the terminal verification results (TVR), the components of which form the basis of an accept/decline decision later in the transaction flow. This feature lets, for example, card issuers permit cardholders to keep using expired cards after their expiry date, but for all transactions with an expired card to be performed on-line.

===Offline data authentication (ODA)===
Offline data authentication is a cryptographic check to validate the card using public-key cryptography. There are three different processes that can be undertaken depending on the card:
*&quot;Static data authentication&quot; (SDA) ensures data read from the card has been signed by the card issuer. This prevents modification of data, but does not prevent cloning.
*&quot;Dynamic data authentication&quot; (DDA) provides protection against modification of data and cloning.
*&quot;Combined DDA/generate application cryptogram&quot; (CDA) combines DDA with the generation of a card&#x27;s &quot;application cryptogram&quot; to assure card validity. Support of CDA in devices may be needed, as this process has been implemented in specific markets. This process is not mandatory in terminals and can only be carried out where both card and terminal support it.

===EMV certificates===
To verify the authenticity of payment cards, EMV certificates are used. The EMV Certificate Authority issues digital certificates to payment card issuers. When requested, the payment card chip provides the card issuer&#x27;s public key certificate and SSAD to the terminal. The terminal retrieves the CA&#x27;s public key from local storage and uses it to confirm trust for the CA and, if trusted, to verify the card issuer&#x27;s public key was signed by the CA. If the card issuer&#x27;s public key is valid, the terminal uses the card issuer&#x27;s public key to verify the card&#x27;s SSAD was signed by the card issuer.

===Cardholder verification===
Cardholder verification is used to evaluate whether the person presenting the card is the legitimate cardholder. There are many cardholder verification methods (CVMs) supported in EMV. They are
*Signature
*Offline plaintext PIN
*Offline enciphered PIN
*Offline plaintext PIN and signature
*Offline enciphered PIN and signature
*Online PIN
*No CVM required
*Consumer Device CVM
*Fail CVM processing

The terminal uses a CVM list read from the card to determine the type of verification to perform. The CVM list establishes a priority of CVMs to use relative to the capabilities of the terminal. Different terminals support different CVMs. ATMs generally support online PIN. POS terminals vary in their CVM support depending on type and country.

For offline enciphered PIN methods, the terminal encrypts the cleartext PIN block with the card&#x27;s public key before sending it to the card with the Verify command. For the online PIN method, the cleartext PIN block is encrypted by the terminal using its point-to-point encryption key before sending it to the acquirer processor in the authorization request message.

All offline methods are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
In 2017, EMVCo added support for biometric verification methods in version 4.3 of the EMV specifications.

===Terminal risk management===
Terminal risk management is only performed in devices where there is a decision to be made whether a transaction should be authorised on-line or offline. If transactions are always carried out on-line (e.g., ATMs) or always off-line, this step can be skipped. Terminal risk management checks the transaction amount against an offline ceiling limit (above which transactions should be processed on-line). It is also possible to have a 1 in an online counter, and a check against a hot card list (which is only necessary for off-line transactions). If the result of any of these tests is positive, the terminal sets the appropriate bit in the terminal verification results (TVR).

===Terminal action analysis===
The results of previous processing steps are used to determine whether a transaction should be approved offline, sent online for authorization, or declined offline. This is done using a combination of data objects known as &quot;terminal action codes&quot; (TACs) held in the terminal and &quot;issuer action codes&quot; (IACs) read from the card. The TAC is logically OR&#x27;d with the IAC, to give the transaction acquirer a level of control over the transaction outcome. Both types of action code take the values Denial, Online, and Default. Each action code contains a series of bits which correspond to the bits in the Terminal verification results (TVR), and are used in the terminal&#x27;s decision whether to accept, decline or go on-line for a payment transaction. The TAC is set by the card acquirer; in practice card schemes advise the TAC settings that should be used for a particular terminal type depending on its capabilities. The IAC is set by the card issuer; some card issuers may decide that expired cards should be rejected, by setting the appropriate bit in the Denial IAC. Other issuers may want the transaction to proceed on-line so that they can in some cases allow these transactions to be carried out. 

When an online-only device performs IAC-Online and TAC-Online processing the only relevant TVR bit is &quot;Transaction value exceeds the floor limit&quot;. Because the floor limit is set to zero, the transaction should always go online and all other values in TAC-Online or IAC-Online are irrelevant. Online-only devices do not need to perform IAC-default processing. An online-only device such as an ATM always attempts to go on-line with the authorization request, unless declined off-line due to IAC-Denial settings. During IAC-Denial and TAC-Denial processing, for an online only device, the only relevant Terminal verification results bit is &quot;Service not allowed&quot;.

===First card action analysis ===
One of the data objects read from the card in the Read application data stage is CDOL1 (Card Data object List). This object is a list of tags that the card wants to be sent to it to make a decision on whether to approve or decline a transaction (including transaction amount, but many other data objects too). The terminal sends this data and requests a cryptogram using the generate application cryptogram command. Depending on the terminal&#x27;s decision (offline, online, decline), the terminal requests one of the following cryptograms from the card:

*Transaction certificate (TC)—offline approval
*Authorization Request Cryptogram (ARQC)—online authorization
*Application Authentication Cryptogram (AAC)—offline decline

This step gives the card the opportunity to accept the terminal&#x27;s action analysis or to decline a transaction or force a transaction on-line. The card cannot return a TC when an ARQC has been asked for, but can return an ARQC when a TC has been asked for.

===Online transaction authorization===
Transactions go online when an ARQC has been requested. The ARQC is sent in the authorisation message. The card generates the ARQC. Its format depends on the card application. EMV does not specify the contents of the ARQC. The ARQC created by the card application is a digital signature of the transaction details, which the card issuer can check in real time. This provides a strong cryptographic check that the card is genuine. The issuer responds to an authorization request with a response code (accepting or declining the transaction), an authorisation response cryptogram (ARPC) and optionally an issuer script (a string of commands to be sent to the card).

ARPC processing is not performed in contact transactions processed with Visa Quick Chip for EMV and Mastercard M/Chip Fast, and in contactless transactions across schemes because the card is removed from the reader after the ARQC has been generated.

===Second card action analysis===
CDOL2 (Card data object list) contains a list of tags that the card wanted to be sent after online transaction authorisation (response code, ARPC, etc.). Even if for any reason the terminal could not go online (e.g., communication failure), the terminal should send this data to the card again using the generate authorisation cryptogram command. This lets the card know the issuer&#x27;s response. The card application may then reset offline usage limits.

===Issuer script processing===
If a card issuer wants to update a card post issuance it can send commands to the card using issuer script processing. Issuer scripts are meaningless to the terminal and can be encrypted between the card and the issuer to provide additional security. Issuer script can be used to block cards, or change card parameters.

Issuer script processing is not available in contact transactions processed with Visa Quick Chip for EMV and Mastercard M/Chip Fast, and for contactless transactions across schemes.

==EMV chip specification==
The first version of EMV standard was published in 1995. Now the standard is defined and managed by the privately owned corporation EMVCo LLC. The current members of EMVCo are American Express, Discover Financial, JCB International, Mastercard, China UnionPay, and Visa Inc. Each of these organizations owns an equal share of EMVCo and has representatives in the EMVCo organization and EMVCo working groups.

Recognition of compliance with the EMV standard (i.e., device certification) is issued by EMVCo following submission of results of testing performed by an accredited testing house.

EMV Compliance testing has two levels: EMV Level 1, which covers physical, electrical and transport level interfaces, and EMV Level 2, which covers payment application selection and credit financial transaction processing.

After passing common EMVCo tests, the software must be certified by payment brands to comply with proprietary EMV implementations such as Visa VSDC, American Express AEIPS, Mastercard MChip, JCB JSmart, or EMV-compliant implementations of non-EMVCo members such as LINK in the UK, or Interac in Canada.

==List of EMV documents and standards==

As of 2011, since version 4.0, the official EMV standard documents which define all the components in an EMV payment system are published as four &quot;books&quot; and some additional documents:
* Book 1: Application Independent ICC to Terminal Interface Requirements
* Book 2: Security and Key Management
* Book 3: Application Specification
* Book 4: Cardholder, Attendant, and Acquirer Interface Requirements
* Common Payment Application Specification
* EMV Card Personalisation Specification

===Versions===
The first EMV standard came into view in 1995 as EMV 2.0. This was upgraded to EMV 3.0 in 1996 (sometimes referred to as EMV &#x27;96) with later amendments to EMV 3.1.1 in 1998. This was further amended to version 4.0 in December 2000 (sometimes referred to as EMV 2000). Version 4.0 became effective in June 2004. Version 4.1 became effective in June 2007. Version 4.2 is in effect since June 2008. Version 4.3 is in effect since November 2011.

==Vulnerabilities==

=== Opportunities to harvest PINs and clone magnetic stripes ===
In addition to the track-two data on the magnetic stripe, EMV cards generally have identical data encoded on the chip, which is read as part of the normal EMV transaction process. If an EMV reader is compromised to the extent that the conversation between the card and the terminal is intercepted, then the attacker may be able to recover both the track-two data and the PIN, allowing construction of a magnetic stripe card, which, while not usable in a Chip and PIN terminal, can be used, for example, in terminal devices that permit fallback to magstripe processing for foreign customers without chip cards, and defective cards. This attack is possible only where (a) the offline PIN is presented in plaintext by the PIN entry device to the card, where (b) magstripe fallback is permitted by the card issuer and (c) where geographic and behavioural checking may not be carried out by the card issuer.

APACS, representing the UK payment industry, claimed that changes specified to the protocol (where card verification values differ between the magnetic stripe and the chip – the iCVV) rendered this attack ineffective and that such measures would be in place from January 2008. Tests on cards in February 2008 indicated this may have been delayed.

==== Successful attacks ====
Conversation capturing is a form of attack which was reported to have taken place against Shell terminals in May 2006, when they were forced to disable all EMV authentication in their petrol stations after more than £1 million was stolen from customers.

In October 2008, it was reported that hundreds of EMV card readers intended for use in Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Belgium had been tampered with in China during or shortly after manufacture. For nine months, details and PINs of credit and debit cards were sent over mobile phone networks to criminals in Lahore, Pakistan. United States National Counterintelligence Executive Joel Brenner said, &quot;Previously only a nation state&#x27;s intelligence agency would have been capable of pulling off this type of operation. It&#x27;s scary.&quot; Stolen data was typically used a couple of months after the card transactions to make it harder for investigators to pin down the vulnerability. After the fraud was discovered it was found that tampered-with terminals could be identified as the additional circuitry increased their weight by about 100 grams. Tens of millions of pounds are believed to have been stolen. This vulnerability spurred efforts to implement better control of POS devices over their entire lifecycle, a practice endorsed by electronic payment security standards like those being developed by the Secure POS Vendor Alliance (SPVA).

==== PIN harvesting and stripe cloning ====
In a February 2008 BBC &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme Cambridge University researchers Steven Murdoch and Saar Drimer demonstrated one example attack, to illustrate that Chip and PIN is not secure enough to justify passing the liability to prove fraud from banks onto customers. The Cambridge University exploit allowed the experimenters to obtain both card data to create a magnetic stripe and the PIN.

APACS, the UK payments association, disagreed with the majority of the report, saying &quot;The types of attack on PIN entry devices detailed in this report are difficult to undertake and not currently economically viable for a fraudster to carry out.&quot; They also said that changes to the protocol (specifying different card verification values between the chip and magnetic stripe – the iCVV) would make this attack ineffective from January 2008.

In August 2016, NCR Corporation security researchers showed how credit card thieves can rewrite the code of a magnetic strip to make it appear like a chipless card, which allows for counterfeiting.

===2010: Hidden hardware disables PIN checking on stolen card===

On 11 February 2010 Murdoch and Drimer&#x27;s team at Cambridge University announced that they had found &quot;a flaw in chip and PIN so serious they think it shows that the whole system needs a re-write&quot; that was &quot;so simple that it shocked them&quot;. A stolen card is connected to an electronic circuit and to a fake card which is inserted into the terminal (&quot;man-in-the-middle attack&quot;). Any four digits can be typed in and accepted as a valid PIN.

A team from the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme visited a Cambridge University cafeteria (with permission) with the system, and were able to pay using their own cards (a thief would use stolen cards) connected to the circuit, inserting a fake card and typing in &quot;0000&quot; as the PIN. The transactions were registered as normal, and were not picked up by banks&#x27; security systems. A member of the research team said, &quot;Even small-scale criminal systems have better equipment than we have. The amount of technical sophistication needed to carry out this attack is really quite low.&quot; The announcement of the vulnerability said, &quot;The expertise that is required is not high (undergraduate level electronics). We dispute the assertion by the banking industry that criminals are not sophisticated enough, because they have already demonstrated a far higher level of skill than is necessary for this attack in their miniaturized PIN entry device skimmers.&quot; It was not known if this vulnerability had been exploited, but it could explain unresolved cases of claimed fraud.

EMVCo disagreed and published a response saying that, while such an attack might be theoretically possible, it would be extremely difficult and expensive to carry out successfully, that current compensating controls are likely to detect or limit the fraud, and that the possible financial gain from the attack is minimal while the risk of a declined transaction or exposure of the fraudster is significant. The Cambridge team disagrees: they carried it out without the banks noticing, with off-the-shelf equipment with some non-sophisticated additions. Less bulky versions could easily be made. The ones producing such equipment for the attack need not put themselves at risk, but can sell it to anybody via the Internet.

When approached for comment, several banks (Co-operative Bank, Barclays and HSBC) each said that this was an industry-wide issue, and referred the &quot;Newsnight&quot; team to the banking trade association for further comment. According to Phil Jones of the Consumers&#x27; Association, Chip and PIN has helped to bring down instances of card crime, but many cases remain unexplained. &quot;What we do know is that we do have cases that are brought forward from individuals which seem quite persuasive.&quot;

The attack uses the fact that the choice of authentication method is unauthenticated, which allows the man in the middle. The terminal asks for a PIN, gets it and gets the transaction confirmed by the card – which thinks it is doing a card-and-signature transaction, which could indeed succeed offline. It also works online, perhaps because of insufficient checks.

Originally, bank customers had to prove that they had not been negligent with their PIN before getting redress, but UK regulations in force from 1 November 2009 placed the onus on banks to prove that a customer has been negligent in any dispute, with the customer given 13 months to make a claim. Murdoch said that &quot;[the banks] should look back at previous transactions where the customer said their PIN had not been used and the bank record showed it has, and consider refunding these customers because it could be they are victim of this type of fraud.&quot;

===2011: CVM downgrade allows arbitrary PIN harvest===
At the CanSecWest conference in March 2011, Andrea Barisani and Daniele Bianco presented research uncovering a vulnerability in EMV that would allow arbitrary PIN harvesting despite the cardholder verification configuration of the card, even when the supported CVMs data is signed.

The PIN harvesting can be performed with a chip skimmer. In essence, a CVM list that has been modified to downgrade the CVM to Offline PIN is still honoured by POS terminals, despite its signature being invalid.

===PIN bypass===
In 2020, researchers David Basin, Ralf Sasse, and Jorge Toro from ETH Zurich reported a security issue affecting Visa contactless cards: lack of cryptographic protection of critical data sent by the card to the terminal during an EMV transaction. The data in question determines the cardholder verification method (such as PIN verification) to be used for the transaction. The team demonstrated that it is possible to modify this data to trick the terminal into believing that no PIN is required because the cardholder was verified using their device (e.g. smartphone). The researchers developed a proof-of-concept Android app that effectively turns a physical Visa card into a mobile payment app (e.g. Apple Pay, Google Pay) to perform PIN-free, high-value purchases. The attack is carried out using two NFC-enabled smartphones, one held near the physical card and the second held near the payment terminal. The attack might affect cards by Discover and China&#x27;s UnionPay but this was not demonstrated in practice, in contrast to Visa cards.

In early 2021, the same team disclosed that Mastercard cards are also vulnerable to a PIN bypass attack. They showed that criminals can trick a terminal into transacting with a Mastercard contactless card while believing it to be a Visa card. This &quot;card brand mixup&quot; has critical consequences since it can be used in combination with the PIN bypass for Visa to also bypass the PIN for Mastercard cards.

==Implementation==
EMV stands for &quot;Europay, Mastercard, and Visa&quot;, the three companies that created the standard. The standard is now managed by EMVCo, a consortium of financial companies. Additional widely known chips of the EMV standard are:
* AEIPS: American Express
* UICS: China Union Pay
* J Smart: JCB
* D-PAS: Discover/Diners Club International
* Rupay: NPCI
* Verve

Visa and Mastercard have also developed standards for using EMV cards in devices to support card not present transactions (CNP) over the telephone and Internet. Mastercard has the Chip Authentication Program (CAP) for secure e-commerce. Its implementation is known as EMV-CAP and supports a number of modes. Visa has the Dynamic Passcode Authentication (DPA) scheme, which is their implementation of CAP using different default values.

In many countries of the world, debit card and/or credit card payment networks have implemented liability shifts. Normally, the card issuer is liable for fraudulent transactions. However, after a liability shift is implemented, if the ATM or merchant&#x27;s point of sale terminal does not support EMV, the ATM owner or merchant is liable for the fraudulent transaction.

Chip and PIN systems can cause problems for travellers from countries that do not issue Chip and PIN cards as some retailers may refuse to accept their chipless cards. While most terminals still accept a magnetic strip card, and the major credit card brands require vendors to accept them, some staff may refuse to take the card, under the belief that they are held liable for any fraud if the card cannot verify a PIN. Non-chip-and-PIN cards may also not work in some unattended vending machines at, for example, train stations, or self-service check-out tills at supermarkets.

====United Kingdom====
Chip and PIN was trialled in Northampton, England from May 2003, and as a result was rolled out nationwide in the United Kingdom on 14 February 2006 with advertisements in the press and national television touting the &quot;Safety in Numbers&quot; slogan. During the first stages of deployment, if a fraudulent magnetic swipe card transaction was deemed to have occurred, the retailer was refunded by the issuing bank, as was the case prior to the introduction of Chip and PIN. On January 1, 2005, the liability for such transactions was shifted to the retailer; this acted as an incentive for retailers to upgrade their point of sale (PoS) systems, and most major high-street chains upgraded on time for the EMV deadline. Many smaller businesses were initially reluctant to upgrade their equipment, as it required a completely new PoS system—a significant investment.

New cards featuring both magnetic strips and chips are now issued by all major banks. The replacement of pre-Chip and PIN cards was a major issue, as banks simply stated that consumers would receive their new cards &quot;when their old card expires&quot; — despite many people having had cards with expiry dates as late as 2007. The card issuer Switch lost a major contract with HBOS to Visa, as they were not ready to issue the new cards as early as the bank wanted.

The Chip and PIN implementation was criticised as designed to reduce the liability of banks in cases of claimed card fraud by requiring the customer to prove that they had acted &quot;with reasonable care&quot; to protect their PIN and card, rather than on the bank having to prove that the signature matched. Before Chip and PIN, if a customer&#x27;s signature was forged, the banks were legally liable and had to reimburse the customer. Until 1 November 2009 there was no such law protecting consumers from fraudulent use of their Chip and PIN transactions, only the voluntary Banking Code. There were many reports that banks refused to reimburse victims of fraudulent card use, claiming that their systems could not fail under the circumstances reported, despite several documented successful large-scale attacks.

The Payment Services Regulations 2009 came into force on 1 November 2009 and shifted the onus onto the banks to prove, rather than assume, that the cardholder is at fault. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) said &quot;It is for the bank, building society or credit card company to show that the transaction was made by you, and there was no breakdown in procedures or technical difficulty&quot; before refusing liability.

====United States====
After widespread identity theft due to weak security in the point-of-sale terminals at Target, Home Depot, and other major retailers, Visa, Mastercard and Discover in March 2012 – and American Express in June 2012 – announced their EMV migration plans for the United States. Since the announcement, multiple banks and card issuers have announced cards with EMV chip-and-signature technology, including American Express, Bank of America, Citibank, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bank, and several credit unions.

In 2010, a number of companies began issuing pre-paid debit cards that incorporate Chip and PIN and allow Americans to load cash as euros or pound sterling. United Nations Federal Credit Union was the first United States issuer to offer Chip and PIN credit cards. In May 2010, a press release from Gemalto (a global EMV card producer) indicated that United Nations Federal Credit Union in New York would become the first EMV card issuer in the United States, offering an EMV Visa credit card to its customers. JPMorgan was the first major bank to introduce a card with EMV technology, namely its Palladium card, in mid-2012.

As of April 2016, 70% of U.S. consumers had EMV cards and as of December 2016 roughly 50% of merchants were EMV compliant. However, deployment has been slow and inconsistent across vendors. Even merchants with EMV hardware may not be able to process chip transactions due to software or compliance deficiencies. Bloomberg has also cited issues with software deployment, including changes to audio prompts for Verifone machines which can take several months to release and deploy software out. Industry experts, however, expect more standardization in the United States for software deployment and standards. Visa and Mastercard have both implemented standards to speed up chip transactions with a goal of reducing the time for these to be under three seconds. These systems are labelled as Visa Quick Chip and Mastercard M/Chip Fast.
*American Express implemented liability shift for point of sale terminals on 1 October 2015. For pay at the pump, at gas stations, the liability shift was 16 April 2021. This was extended from 1 October 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
*Discover implemented liability shift on 1 October 2015. For pay at the pump, at gas stations, the liability shift was 1 October 2020.
*Maestro implemented liability shift of 19 April 2013, for international cards used in the United States.
*Mastercard implemented liability shift for point of sale terminals on 1 October 2015. For pay at the pump, at gas stations, the liability shift formally was on 1 October 2020. For ATMs, the liability shift date was on 1 October 2016.
*Visa implemented liability shift for point of sale terminals on 1 October 2015. For pay at the pump, at gas stations, the liability shift formally was on 1 October 2020. For ATMs, the liability shift date was on 1 October 2017.

<text>Laura D&#x27;Andrea Tyson (born June 28, 1947) is an American economist and university administrator who is currently a Distinguished Professor of the Graduate School at the Haas School of Business of the University of California, Berkeley and a senior fellow at the Berggruen Institute. She served as the 16th Chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers from 1993 to 1995 and 2nd Director of the National Economic Council from 1995 to 1996 under President Bill Clinton. Tyson was the first woman to hold each of those posts. She remains the only person to have served in both posts.

== Early life and education ==
Tyson was born Laura D&#x27;Andrea in New Jersey. Her father was Italian American and her mother was of Swedish and Dutch descent. Tyson graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; with a B.A. in Economics from Smith College in 1969 and earned her Ph.D. in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1974. Her doctoral advisor was Evsey Domar. She joined the faculty of the economics department at Princeton University in 1974 and remained in the position until 1977 when she became a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. She was appointed a professor of business administration in 1990.

== Career ==
On December 12, 1992, President-elect Bill Clinton announced his intention to nominate Tyson as Chairman of the President&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers. She was confirmed by the United States Senate in 1993 and served until her appointment as Director of the National Economic Council from 1995 to 1996. She was the first woman in both roles. During her time with the Clinton administration, Tyson was a spokesperson in favour of GATT, arguing with Sir James Goldsmith on Charlie Rose that American jobs would be increased by the trade agreement. 

After leaving politics, Tyson returned to UC Berkeley, becoming Dean of the Haas School of Business from 1998 to 2001. She later served as Dean of London Business School from 2002 to 2006. She was the first woman to lead both institutions. 

Tyson has been a member of the Council on Foreign Relations since 1987, a board director of Morgan Stanley since 1997, a board director of AT&amp;T Inc. since 1999, and a board director of Eastman Kodak. She is a member of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation. In December 2009 it was announced that Tyson would join CB Richard Ellis Board of Directors on March 4, 2010. Tyson also sits on the QFINANCE Strategic Advisory Board.

Tyson has published a number of books and articles on industrial competitiveness, trade, and the economies of Central Europe and their transitions to market systems.

An &quot;Economic Viewpoint&quot; columnist for &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; magazine, Tyson writes regularly about domestic and international economic policy matters in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other nationally and internationally syndicated newspapers and magazines.

In addition to her professorship at UC Berkeley, Tyson is also a member of the Board of Trustees at UC Berkeley&#x27;s Blum Center for Developing Economies. The center is focused on finding solutions to address the crisis of extreme poverty and disease in the developing world.

Tyson joined Berkeley Research Group, LLC, an expert services advisory firm co-founded by David Teece, as a special advisor in 2010. Tyson had consulted for LECG, another expert advisory firm founded by Teece, from 1997 to 2001.

Since 2012, she has written monthly columns for international media organization Project Syndicate.

In November 2013, Tyson founded the Institute for Business and Social Impact at the University of California, Berkeley, Haas School of Business.

<doc id="458527" wikidata="Q5868310" url="?curid=458527" title="Francis North, 1st Baron Guilford">
<text>Francis North, 1st Baron Guilford, PC, KC (22 October 1637 – 5 September 1685) was the third son of Dudley North, 4th Baron North, and his wife Anne Montagu, daughter of Sir Charles Montagu of Boughton House and Mary Whitmore. He was created Baron Guilford in 1683, after becoming Lord Keeper of the Great Seal in succession to Lord Nottingham.

==Biography==
Francis North was educated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge and was admitted to the Middle Temple on 27 November 1655. He was Called to the Bar on 28 June 1661. He was an eminent lawyer, Solicitor-General (1671), Attorney-General (1673), and Chief Justice of the Common Pleas (1675), and in 1679 was made a member of the Privy Council Ministry and, on its dissolution, of the Cabinet. He was a man of wide culture and a staunch royalist, although he opposed the absolutist tendencies of Sunderland and Jeffreys, his two bitterest political enemies. He was a strong supporter of the royal prerogative, remarking that he did not see how any honest lawyer could oppose it, as all the precedents were in its favour. He became Lord Keeper of the Great Seal in 1682, an office tied with the one of Lord Chancellor at the time.

==Popish Plot and afterwards ==

Guilford sat as a judge at some of the Popish Plot trials, and like his colleagues, he has been accused of excessive credulity in believing the lies of Titus Oates and the other informers. On the other hand, it has been argued that the senior Chief Justice, Sir William Scroggs, so dominated the proceedings that none of the other judges had any influence on the outcome. If North succumbed to the prevailing hysteria, so did many others: his brother Roger wrote that &quot;it was a time when wise men behaved like stark fools&quot;.

When public opinion finally began to turn against the Plot, the Crown moved against its instigators. North presided at the trial of one of the more disreputable of the Plot informers, Stephen College, nicknamed &quot;the Protestant joiner&quot;, for high treason, in August 1681, and virtually ordered the jury to convict him. College was duly found guilty and hanged. North&#x27;s conduct of the trial attracted a great deal of criticism, as the evidence of treason (College was accused of appearing in arms at the Oxford Parliament) was considered by many to be flimsy, and the charge had already been thrown out by a grand jury.

==Later years ==

Guilford was hostile to Lord Jeffreys, and regarded the future Lord Chief Justice, Sir Robert Wright, as utterly unfit for any judicial office; he was well qualified to assess Wright&#x27;s ability since Wright as a young barrister had been a friend of his and had relied on North to write his legal opinions for him. He has been criticised for remaining in office after Wright was made Chief Justice over his vehement objections, especially as it must have been clear that he no longer had any influence over judicial appointments. On the other hand, he may have felt that keeping Jeffreys out of the Lord Chancellorship was a sufficient justification for clinging to office.

==Character ==

Guilford was generally respected for his integrity, (apart perhaps from his conduct of the trial of Stephen College), but he was sometimes accused of self-importance and a lack of any sense of humour; for example, he showed excessive agitation at the ridiculous rumour spread by Sunderland and Jeffreys that he had been seen riding on a rhinoceros. Sunderland hated North with a passion, describing him as the most unfit man who ever held his office: &quot;partial, unreasonable, corrupt, arbitrary and ignorant&quot;. There is no reason to believe any of these accusations: certainly no one, other than Sunderland, seems to have thought that Guilford was either corrupt or ignorant. 

==Death ==
Guilford died, it seems rather unexpectedly, at his country house, Wroxton Abbey, near Banbury, on 5 September 1685, aged only 47. Although he had apparently been suffering from stress and overwork, the precise reasons for his early death are unclear. His rather cryptic last words were: &quot;It will not do&quot;.

==Family==
In 1672 he married Lady Frances Pope, daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Pope, 3rd Earl of Downe by his wife Beatrice (Beata) Poole, daughter of Henry Poole. Frances inherited the Wroxton estate. He was succeeded as 2nd baron by his only son Francis North, 2nd Baron Guilford (1673–1729).

==Works==
Like many upper-class Englishmen of his time, North was devoted to music. Less typically for his time and class he had a keen interest in musical theory (as did his brother Roger), and published a book on the subject, &quot;A Philosophical essay on musick&quot; (1677), which has been praised as &quot;an admirably clear exposition of the physical basis of music&quot;. Francis North&#x27;s musical notations have been described as the earliest known examples of &quot;synthetic phonograms&quot;.

<doc id="458531" wikidata="Q5017800" url="?curid=458531" title="Cairo–Haifa train bombings 1948">
<text>During the 1948 Palestine war, on February 29 and again on March 31, the military coaches of the Cairo-Haifa train were mined by the Zionist militant group Lehi.

On February 29, Lehi mined the train north of Rehovot, killing 28 British soldiers and wounding 35. No civilians were hurt. One or more bombs laid on the track were detonated from a nearby orange grove. Lehi took credit for the bombing of the British train claiming it was revenge for the Ben Yehuda Street Bombing in Jerusalem. The train was the normal daily passenger express to which four military coaches had been attached.

On March 31, Lehi again mined the train, this time near Binyamina, a Jewish town near Caesarea, killing 40 Arab civilians, and wounding 60. Although there were some soldiers on the train, none were injured.

==Background==
The attacks on the train line had begun in 1947. On April 22, 1947, the train was mined outside Rehovot, the bombing killed five British officers, two Arab adults and a 3-year old, Gilbert Balladi.

On May 15, 1947, the train track was bombed seven times south of Lydda. Two British army lieutenants were killed, two others seriously wounded and five other hurt in one bombing between Acre and Haifa. One commuter was injured when the engine and two cars were derailed by another bomb earlier in the day. Three crew-men were injured when their freight train was derailed in another bombing. Three railroad bridges were damaged in the attacks. Lehi reportedly called in warnings.

On August 9, 1947, Irgun bombed a British troop train north of Lydda, killing the Jewish engineer.

On September 29, 1947, the train was bombed by Irgun twenty miles south of Haifa. The engine, coal car and two cabin cars were derailed, one person was hospitalized.

<doc id="458537" wikidata="Q2493511" url="?curid=458537" title="Dudley North (economist)">
<text>Sir Dudley North (16 May 1641 in Westminster31 December 1691 in London) was an English merchant, politician, economist and writer on free trade. He was also a member of the North family.

==Life==
He was the fourth son of Baron Dudley North of Kirtling Tower and Anne Montagu, daughter of Sir Charles Montagu of Boughton House. In his early years he was carried off by Gypsies but was recovered by his family. He was the brother of Lord Chancellor Francis North, 1st Baron Guilford and Roger North, the Solicitor General of the Duke of York, and Attorney General of Queen Mary of Modena of the House of Este. His nephew was Lt. Gen. William North, 6th Baron North, who fought under Prince John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough of Blenheim Palace, named after the Battle of Blenheim in which North fought.

Dudley engaged in foreign trade, especially with Turkey, and spent a number of years at Constantinople and Smyrna. Having returned to London with a fortune, he continued to trade with the Levant. His knowledge of commerce attracted the attention of the government, and he was further recommended by the influence of his brother Lord Guilford. During the Tory reaction under Charles II he was one of the sheriffs forced on the city of London in 1683 with an express view to securing verdicts for the crown in state trials.

He was knighted in 1683, and was appointed a commissioner of customs, and later of the treasury, and then again of the customs. Having been elected a member of parliament in 1685 for Banbury under James II, he took, says Roger North, the place of manager for the crown in all matters of revenue. After the Glorious Revolution he was called to account for his alleged unconstitutional proceedings in his office of sheriff.

He was buried in St Andrew&#x27;s Church at Little Glemham in Suffolk. A memorial on the east wall of the chancel lies nearby. 

==Family==

He had married Anne, the daughter of Sir Robert Cann, 1st Baronet of Compton Greenfield, Gloucestershire, and the widow of Sir Robert Gunning of Cold Ashton, Gloucestershire. They had one surviving son, Dudley North, who succeeded to Glemham, and married Katherine Yale, daughter of Gov. Elihu Yale of Yale College.
==Works==
Some notices of the manners and customs of the east were printed from his papers by his brother.

His tract entitled &quot;Discourses upon Trade&quot;, principally directed to the cases of the interest, coinage, clipping and increase of money, was published anonymously in 1691, and was edited in 1856 by J. R. McCulloch in the &quot;Select Collection of Early English Tracts on Commerce&quot; printed by the Political Economy Club of London. In this assertion of the free-trade doctrine against the system of prohibitions which had gained strength by the Revolution, North shows that wealth may exist independently of gold or silver, its source being human industry, applied either to the cultivation of the soil or to manufactures. It is a mistake to suppose that stagnation of trade arises from want of money; it must arise either from a glut of the home market, or from a disturbance of foreign commerce, or from diminished consumption caused by poverty. The export of money in the course of traffic, instead of diminishing, increases the national wealth, trade being only an exchange of superfluities. Nations are related to the world just in the same way as cities to the state or as families to the city. North emphasizes more than his predecessors the value of the home trade.

With respect to the interest of capital, he maintains that it depends, like the price of any commodity, on the proportion of supply and demand, and that a low rate is a result of the relative increase of capital, and cannot be brought about by arbitrary regulations, as had been proposed by Sir Josiah Child and others. In arguing the question of free trade, he urges that every advantage given to one interest over another is injurious to the public. No trade is unprofitable to the public; if it were, it would be given up; when trades thrive, so does the public, of which they form a part. Prices must determine themselves, and cannot be fixed by law; and all forcible interference with them does harm instead of good. No people can become rich by state regulations, only by peace, industry, freedom and unimpeded economic activity.

North was named by Wilhelm Roscher as one of the triumvirate of the 17th century English school of economists to the foremost place in Europe, the others being John Locke and William Petty.

<text>Dry stone, sometimes called drystack or, in Scotland, drystane, is a building method by which structures are constructed from stones without any mortar to bind them together. A certain amount of binding is obtained through the use of carefully selected interlocking stones.
Dry stone construction is best known in the context of stone walls, traditionally used for the boundaries of fields and churchyards, or as retaining walls for terracing, but dry stone shelters, houses and other structures also exist. The term tends not to be used for the many historic styles which used precisely-shaped stone, but did not use mortar, for example the Greek temple and Inca architecture.
The art of dry stone walling was inscribed in 2018 on the UNESCO representative list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity, for dry stone walls in countries such as France, Greece, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Switzerland and Spain. In 2024, Ireland was added to the list.
== History ==

Some dry stone wall constructions in north-west Europe have been dated back to the Neolithic Age. In County Mayo, Ireland, an entire field system made from dry stone walls, since covered in peat, has been carbon-dated to 3800 BC. These are near contemporary with the, dry stone constructed, neolithic village of Skara Brae, and the Chambered cairn of Scotland.

The cyclopean walls of the acropolis of Mycenae, Greece, have been dated to 1350 BC and those of Tiryns slightly earlier.
Similar example is Daorson, in Bosnia, built around a prehistoric central fortified settlement or acropolis (existed there c. 17–16th C. BCE to the end of the Bronze Age, c. 9–8th C. BCE), and surrounded by cyclopean walls (similar to Mycenae) dated to the 4th C. BCE.

In Belize, the Mayan ruins at Lubaantun illustrate use of dry stone construction in architecture of the 8th and 9th centuries AD.

Great Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe, Africa, is an acropolis-like large city complex constructed in dry stone from the 11th to the 15th centuries AD. It is the largest of structures of similar construction throughout the area.

== Location and terminology ==
Terminology varies regionally. When used as field boundaries, dry stone structures are more commonly known as dykes in Scotland, where professional dry stone wall builders are referred to as &#x27;dykers&#x27;. Dry stone walls are characteristic of upland areas of Britain and Ireland where rock outcrops naturally or large stones exist in quantity in the soil. They are especially abundant in the West of Ireland, particularly Connemara. They may also be found throughout the Mediterranean, including retaining walls used for terracing. Such constructions are common where large stones are plentiful (for example, in The Burren) or conditions are too harsh for hedges capable of retaining livestock to be grown as reliable field boundaries. Many thousands of kilometres of such walls exist, most of them centuries old.
In the United States they are common in areas with rocky soils, such as New England, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. They are a notable characteristic of the bluegrass region of central Kentucky, the Ozarks of Arkansas and Missouri, as well as Virginia, where they are usually referred to as &quot;rock fences&quot; or &quot;stone fences&quot;, and the Napa Valley in north central California. The technique of construction was brought to America primarily by English and Scots-Irish immigrants. The technique was also taken to Australia (principally western Victoria, some parts of Tasmania, and some parts of New South Wales, particularly around Kiama) and New Zealand (especially Otago).
Similar walls also are found in the Swiss–Italian border region, where they are often used to enclose the open space under large natural boulders or outcrops.
The higher-lying rock-rich fields and pastures in Bohemia&#x27;s south-western border range of Šumava (e.g. around the mountain river of Vydra) are often lined by dry stone walls built of field-stones removed from the arable or cultural land. They serve both as cattle/sheep fences and the lot&#x27;s borders. Sometimes also the dry stone terracing is apparent, often combined with parts of stone masonry (house foundations and shed walls) that are held together by a clay and pine needle &quot;composite&quot; mortar. 
The dry stone walling tradition of Croatia was added to the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in November 2018, alongside those of Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland. In Croatia, dry stone walls () were built for a variety of reasons: to clear the earth of stone for crops; to delineate land ownership; or for shelter against the bora wind. Some walls date back to the Liburnian era. Notable examples include the island of Baljenac, which has of dry stone walls despite being only in area, and the vineyards of Primošten.

In Peru in the 15th century AD, the Inca made use of otherwise unusable slopes by building dry stone walls to create terraces. They also employed this mode of construction for freestanding walls. Their ashlar type construction in Machu Picchu uses the classic Inca architectural style of polished dry stone walls of regular shape. The Incas were masters of this technique, in which blocks of stone are cut to fit together tightly without mortar. Many junctions are so perfect that not even a knife fits between the stones. The structures have persisted in the high earthquake region because of the flexibility of the walls, and because in their double wall architecture, the two portions of the walls incline into each other.

== Construction ==
The style and method of construction of a wall will vary, depending on the type of stone available, its intended use and local tradition. Many older walls were constructed from stones and boulders cleared from the fields during preparation for agriculture (&quot;field stones&quot;) although some used stone quarried nearby. For modern walls, quarried stone is almost always used.

One type of wall is called a &quot;double&quot; wall and is constructed by placing two rows of stones along the boundary to be walled. The foundation stones are ideally set into the ground so as to rest firmly on the subsoil. The rows are composed of large flattish stones, diminishing in size as the wall rises. Smaller stones may be used as chocks in areas where the natural stone shape is more rounded. The walls are built up to the desired height layer-by-layer (&quot;course by course&quot;) and, at intervals, large tie-stones or &quot;through stones&quot; are placed which span both faces of the wall and sometimes protrude. These have the effect of bonding what would otherwise be two thin walls leaning against each other, greatly increasing the strength of the wall. Diminishing the width of the wall as it gets higher, as traditionally done in Britain, also strengthens the wall considerably. The voids between the facing stones are carefully packed with smaller stones (&quot;filling&quot;, &quot;hearting&quot;).

The final layer on the top of the wall also consists of large stones, called &quot;capstones&quot;, &quot;coping stones&quot; or &quot;copes&quot;. As with the tie stones, the capstones span the entire width of the wall and prevent it breaking apart. In some areas, such as South Wales, there is a tradition of placing the coping stones on a final layer of flat stones slightly wider than the top of the wall proper (&quot;coverbands&quot;).
In addition to gates, a wall may contain smaller purposely built gaps for the passage or control of wildlife and livestock such as sheep. The smaller holes usually no more than in height are called &quot;Bolt Holes&quot; or &quot;Smoots&quot;. Larger ones may be between in height, which are called &quot;Cripple Holes&quot;.
Boulder walls are a type of single wall in which the wall consists primarily of large boulders, around which smaller stones are placed. Single walls work best with large, flatter stones. Ideally, the largest stones are being placed at the bottom and the whole wall tapers toward the top. Sometimes a row of capstones completes the top of a wall, with the long rectangular side of each capstone perpendicular to the wall alignment.

Galloway dykes consist of a base of double-wall construction or larger boulders with single-wall construction above. They appear to be rickety, with many holes, which deters livestock (and people) from attempting to cross them. These dykes are principally found in locations with exceptionally high winds, where a solid wall might be at risk of being unsettled by the buffeting. The porous nature of the wall significantly reduces wind force but takes greater skill to construct. They are also found in grazing areas where they are used to maximize the utility of the available stones (where ploughing was not turning up ever more stones).
Another variation is the Cornish hedge or Welsh &quot;clawdd&quot;, which is a stone-clad earth bank topped by turf, scrub, or trees and characterised by a strict inward-curved batter (the slope of the &quot;hedge&quot;). As with many other varieties of wall, the height is the same as the width of the base, and the top is half the base width.

Different regions have made minor modifications to the general method of construction—sometimes because of limitations of building material available, but also to create a look that is distinctive for that area. Whichever method is used to build a dry stone wall, considerable skill is required. Correcting any mistakes invariably means disassembling down to the level of the error. Selection of the correct stone for every position in the wall makes an enormous difference to the lifetime of the finished product, and a skilled waller will take time making the selection.
As with many older crafts, skilled wallers, today, are few in number. With the advent of modern wire fencing, fields can be fenced with much less time and expense using wire than using stone walls; however, the initial expense of building dykes is offset by their sturdiness and consequent long, low-maintenance lifetimes. As a result of the increasing appreciation of the landscape and heritage value of dry stone walls, wallers remain in demand, as do the walls themselves. A nationally recognised certification scheme is operated in the UK by the Dry Stone Walling Association, with four grades from Initial to Master Craftsman.
Notable examples include the Mourne Wall, a wall in the Mourne Mountains in County Down, Northern Ireland, and the wall around the Ottenby nature reserve, built by Charles X Gustav in the mid-17th century in Öland, Sweden.

== Other uses ==

While the dry stone technique is most commonly used for the construction of double-wall stone walls and single-wall retaining terracing, dry stone sculptures, buildings, fortifications, bridges, and other structures also exist.
Traditional turf-roofed Highland blackhouses were constructed using the double-wall dry stone method. When buildings are constructed using this method, the middle of the wall is generally filled with earth or sand in order to eliminate draughts. During the Iron Age, and perhaps earlier, the technique also was used to build fortifications such as the walls of Eketorp Castle (Öland, Sweden), Maiden Castle, North Yorkshire, Reeth, Dunlough Castle in southwest Ireland and the rampart of the Long Scar Dyke. Many of the dry-stone walls that exist today in Scotland can be dated to the 14th century or earlier when they were built to divide fields and retain livestock. Some extremely well built examples are found on the lands of Muchalls Castle.
Dry stone walls can be built against embankments or even vertical terraces. If they are subjected to lateral earth pressure, they are retaining walls of the type gravity wall. The weight of the stones resists the pressure from the retained soil, including any surcharges, and the friction between the stones causes most of them to act as if they were a monolithic gravity wall of the same weight. Dry stone retaining walls were once built in great numbers for agricultural terracing and also to carry paths, roads and railways. Although dry stone is seldom used for these purposes today, a great many are still in use and maintained. New ones are often built in gardens and nature conservation areas. Dry stone retaining structures continue to be a subject of research.
In northeastern Somalia, on the coastal plain to Aluula&#x27;s east are found ruins of an ancient monument in a platform style. The structure is formed by a rectangular dry stone wall that is low in height; the space in between is filled with rubble and manually covered with small stones. Relatively large standing stones are also positioned on the edifice&#x27;s corners. Near the platform are graves, which are outlined in stones. Measuring , the structure is the largest of a string of ancient platform and enclosed platform monuments exclusive to far northeastern Somalia.
In Great Britain, Ireland, France and Switzerland, it is possible to find small dry stone structures built as signs, marking mountain paths or boundaries of owned land. In many countries, cairns, as they are called in Scotland, are used as road and mountaintop markers.

<doc id="458544" wikidata="Q98167168" url="?curid=458544" title="Androgen prohormone">
<text>An androgen prohormone, or proandrogen, is a prohormone (or prodrug) of an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS). They can be prohormones of testosterone or of synthetic AAS, for example, nandrolone (19-nortestosterone). Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione may all be considered proandrogens of testosterone.

In the last two decades, prohormones have also been used by bodybuilders, athletes, and nonmedical users of AAS and other hormones to refer to substances that are expected to convert to active hormones in the body. The intent is to provide the benefits of taking an AAS without the legal risks, and to achieve the hoped-for benefits or advantages without use of AAS themselves. Many of these compounds are legal to manufacture, sell, possess and ingest eliminating the legal problems associated with schedule III AAS. This also enables chemists to further their legal research and get around the law (albeit for a short time). The typical definition of &quot;prohormone&quot; includes a steroidal molecule that has the opposite molecular structure to testosterone on either the 3a/b position or the 17b position. Testosterone has a ketone group on the 3 carbon and a hydroxyl on the 17b carbon. A steroid with modifications away from testosterone in one or both of these areas is commonly referred to as a &quot;prohormone&quot;. These enzymatic changes occur with the body&#x27;s bidirectional enzymes.

On October 22, 2004, President Bush signed into law the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004 (118 Stat. 1661).
The bill was written to become effective in 90 days, which was January 20, 2005. This legislation places both AAS and some androgen prohormones on a list of controlled substances (a new type of &quot;regulatory control&quot;). Statutory definition of AAS: &quot;The term &#x27;anabolic steroid&#x27; means any drug or hormonal substance, chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, corticosteroids and dehydroepiandrosterone)&quot;. The Act also lists substances called prohormones, qualifying them as AAS, yet these substances were mainly included in the list due to the generalization of the definition of AAS which makes it currently impossible to synthesize any further substances linked with testosterone for the needs of athlete supplementation.

==Prohormones added to the list of schedule III AAS==
The 108th Congress amended the Controlled Substances Act to include AAS and to add in information about steroids and steroid precursors. This amendment is sometimes called the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004.

The first thing this amendment did was insert a definition of AAS as follows: &quot;The term &#x27;anabolic steroid&#x27; means any drug or hormonal substance, chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, corticosteroids and dehydroepiandrosterone).&quot;

Apart from the definition, the document enumerates the presently known prohormones:

* Androstanediol (3β,17β-dihydroxy-5α-androstane and 3α,17β-dihydroxy-5α-androstane)
* Androstanedione (5α-androstan-3,17-dione)
* 1-Androstenediol (3α,17β-dihydroxy-5α-androst-1-ene)
* 4-Androstenediol (3β,17β-dihydroxy-androst-4-ene)
* 5-Androstenediol (3β,17β-dihydroxy-androst-5-ene)
* 1-Androstenedione (5α-androst-1-en-3,17-dione)
* 4-Androstenedione (androst-4-en-3,17-dione)
* 5-Androstenedione (androst-5-en-3,17-dione)
* Norandrostenediol (19-nor-4-androstenediol or 3β,17β-dihydroxyestr-4-ene)
* 19-Nor-4-androstenediol (3α,17β-dihydroxyestr-4-ene)
* 19-Nor-5-androstenediol (3β,17β-dihydroxyestr-5-ene and 3α,17β-dihydroxyestr-5-ene)
* Norandrostenedione (19-nor-4-androstenedione or estr-4-en-3,17-dione)
* 19-Nor-5-androstenedione (estr-5-en-3,17-dione)
* Any salt, ester, or ether of a drug or substance listed above

Note that this list contains examples and it is not a closed list – any other compound, which affects testosterone, according to the definition is an AAS under U.S. law.

===&quot;Designer steroids&quot; and adulterated supplements===
In view of a total ban from 2004, manufacturers cannot launch next AAS, presently they are interested in substances that are related to hormones, but do not affect testosterone. These include derivatives e.g. methoxydienone (methoxygonadiene; Ethyl Methoxy Gona), methasterone (so called Superdrol or S-Drol) and many others, sometimes called &quot;designer steroids&quot;. Such compounds although harmful, do not infringe the Anabolic Steroid Control Act because they do not have any impact on the testosterone level. Owing to the same reason, they did not assist in building muscle and are not applicable in supporting – it is typical that the descriptions of these compounds try to manipulate the chemical concepts, but do not even mention the possibility of raising testosterone – because they do not even have such a potential.

After the publicity of the fraud in the media many manufacturers lost the trust, and the U.S. health authorities began to eliminate suspicious products. The research carried out by state laboratories confirmed that &quot;designer steroids&quot; are, in fact, pharmaceuticals like metandienone, stanazolol, methylstenbolone, boldenone, chlorodehydromethyltestosterone, DHT, and oxandrolone, added to supplements in a random manner. Supplements with different names and described ingredients could have the same steroid (e.g., chlorodehydromethylandrostenediol (Halodrol), desoxymethyltestosterone (Madol, Pheraplex), others) and sometimes supplements with similar names could have different ingredients (e.g. Finabolic).

==Regulation in the United States and Europe==
Following the introduction of the Anabolic Steroid Control Act, labeling products derived from plant extracts with the help of chemical symbols of organic substances found in these plants or creating names for these substances which referred to prohibited AAS became a popular marketing practice employed by American manufacturers. No analogical act targeting athlete supplementation is in force in the European Union; however each country has its own regulations concerning substances with medicinal properties. Due to the above, one can come in contact with the sale of supplements with names identical to or resembling those questioned by the RDA in the United States (S-DROL, HALODROL, etc.). Laboratory controls indicate that products which declare to include prohormones, prohibited in the USA, in fact contain &quot;classic&quot; AAS of the previous generation. Many consumers in Europe did not know that it was illegal produce prohormones in the USA after the year 2004 and thought that were consuming various versions of the previously acclaimed supplement, while in fact consuming steroids of unknown origin. In situations like ones described above the purchaser of this fake substance knows neither the type nor the dosage of the ingested hormone, and thus cannot plan a safe gastro-protective regime or supplementary treatment. The consumer also cannot gain access to information concerning the possible long-term consequences of treatment with the unspecified hormone. This has led to the popularity of special forums on which consumers could share their experiences with the substances, yet the fake products could have radically different components, despite similar descriptions and names. Supplement manufacturers who have made a name for themselves and want to remain on the market are currently elaborating AAS based on natural substances (usually plant-derived). In Europe these products are called prohormones.

Producers who still want to offer supplements supporting the hormonal balance can still employ the natural compounds. Known in the field of prohormones Patrick Arnold (the one who introduced 1-AD and the first prohormones) is currently working on ursolic acid, on the other hand in Eastern Europe manufacturers launch supplements based on buteins,- natural compounds considered as the strongest aromatase inhibitors.

<text>137 (one hundred [and] thirty-seven) is the natural number following 136 and preceding 138.

== Mathematics ==
137 is:
* the 33rd prime number; the next is 139, with which it comprises a twin prime, and thus 137 is a Chen prime.
* an Eisenstein prime with no imaginary part and a real part of the form formula_1.
* the fourth Stern prime.
* a Pythagorean prime: a prime number of the form formula_2, where formula_3 (formula_4) or the sum of two squares formula_5. 
* a combination of three terms formula_6, cube of 4 + Triangular number T4+T2 on each cube face (along 3 axes) - peaks (single 6th peak as free link)
* a strong prime in the sense that it is more than the arithmetic mean of its two neighboring primes.
* a strictly non-palindromic number and a primeval number.
* a factor of 10001 (the other being 73) and the repdigit 11111111 (= 10001 × 1111).
* using two radii to divide a circle according to the golden ratio yields sectors of approximately 137.51° (the golden angle) and 222° in degree system so 137 is the largest integer before it.
* In decimal notation, 1/137 = 0., so its period value happens to be palindromic and has a period length of only 8. However, this is only special to decimal, as in pentadecimal it (1/92) has a period length of twenty-four (24) and the period value is not at all palindromic.
* a combination of 5! + 4! - 3! - 2! + 1!

== Physics ==
* 1/137 was once thought to be the exact value of the fine-structure constant. The fine-structure constant, a dimensionless physical constant, is approximately 1/137, and the astronomer Arthur Eddington conjectured in 1929 that its reciprocal was in fact precisely the integer 137, which he claimed could be &quot;obtained by pure deduction&quot;. This conjecture was not widely adopted, and by the 1940s, the experimental values for the constant were clearly inconsistent with the conjecture, being roughly 1/137.036. In 2021, researchers at the Kastler Brossel Laboratory in Paris reported the most precise measurement yet, determining the value to be with an accuracy of 81 parts per trillion.
* Physicist Leon M. Lederman numbered his home near Fermilab 137 based on the significance of the number to those in his profession. Lederman expounded on the significance of the number in his 1993 book &quot;The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?&quot;, noting that not only was it the inverse of the fine-structure constant, but was also related to the probability that an electron will emit or absorb a photon—i.e., Feynman&#x27;s conjecture. He added that it also &quot;contains the crux of electromagnetism (the electron), relativity (the velocity of light), and quantum theory (the Planck constant). It would be less unsettling if the relationship between all these important concepts turned out to be one or three or maybe a multiple of pi. But 137?&quot; The number 137, according to Lederman, &quot;shows up naked all over the place&quot;, meaning that scientists on any planet in the universe using whatever units they have for charge or speed, and whatever their version of the Planck constant may be, will all come up with 137, because it is a pure number. Lederman recalled that Richard Feynman had even suggested that all physicists put a sign in their offices with the number 137 to remind them of just how much they do not know.

== Jungian psychology and mysticism ==
* 137 has been the subject of psychological speculation by Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Carl Jung concerning his theory of synchronicity. Jung and physicist Wolfgang Pauli, according to the book &quot;Jung, Pauli, and the Pursuit of a Scientific Obsession&quot; by Arthur I. Miller, Emeritus Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at University College London, Jung and Pauli struggled in their search for a primal number that everything in the world hinges on, as well as a desire to quantify the unconscious. 
* Wolfgang Pauli had a series of significant dreams when he engaged in psychoanalysis with Carl Jung, published in the 12th volume of The Collected Works of C. G. Jung. The dreams were progressively sophisticated, and eventually described a mandalic &quot;world clock&quot;, which might be a symbolic format describing an estimate of the inverse of fine structure constant: α^(-1) = π^1 + π^2 + 4π^3 = 137.036... . The &quot;world-clock&quot; was carried by a black flying bird and consist of three discs and three pulses : SMALL pulse consist of a small pointer on a blue vertical disc advancing by 1/32, representing π ; MIDDLE pulse was one completion of the vertial blue disc of 32 segments, representing π^2, which causes 1/32 advancement of a second outer horizontal disc; GREAT pulse being the complete rotation of the second horizontal disc, which contained 4 coloured sections standing 4 men holding 4 pendulums, representing 4π^3 . The completion of the second disc in the GREAT pulse will cause a full rotation of the third outer ring, which turns from black colour to golden. The function of three pulses of the World-Clock symbolically add up to 137 from π^1 + π^2 + 4π^3.
* While Carl Jung and Wolfgang Pauli were fascinated with the number 137, their lives had been entwined with meaningful synchronicities with this number. Carl Jung was born on the 26 July 1875 (207th day of the 75th year) and died on the 6 June 1961 (157th day of the 61th year), 207days + 75years + 157days + 61years = 136 Years &amp; 364 Days, which is one day from 137 years. Wolfgang Pauli died , as himself expected, in room 137 of the Red-Cross hospital at Zurich. Carl Jung&#x27;s Magnum Opus title &quot;Liber Novus&quot;, also bears an English Gematria value of 137. The English Gematria values of the initials of name of Carl Gustav Jung, also hinted a value of 137 with numbers 3,7,10.
** &quot;137: Jung, Pauli, and the Pursuit of a Scientific Obsession&quot; by Arthur I. Miller, , describes the friendship of Carl Jung and Wolfgang Pauli and their search for the meaning of 137 in science, medieval alchemy, dream interpretation, and the &quot;I Ching&quot;.

<text>Anders Sparrman (27 February 1748 – 9 August 1820) was a Swedish naturalist, abolitionist and an apostle of Carl Linnaeus.

==Biography==

Born in Tensta, Uppland, Sparrman was the son of a clergyman. At the age of nine he enrolled at Uppsala University, beginning medical studies at fourteen and becoming one of the outstanding pupils of Linnaeus. In 1765 he went on a voyage to China as ship&#x27;s doctor, returning two years later and describing the animals and plants he had encountered. On this voyage he met Carl Gustaf Ekeberg.

He sailed for the Cape of Good Hope in January 1772 to do natural history research, supporting himself by tutoring children. When James Cook arrived there later in the year at the start of his second voyage, Sparrman was taken on as assistant naturalist to Johann and Georg Forster. After the voyage he returned to Cape Town in July 1775 and practiced medicine, earning enough to finance a journey into the interior. He was guided by Daniel Ferdinand Immelman, the young frontiersman who had previously guided the Swedish botanist Carl Peter Thunberg. Daniel and Sparrman reached the Great Fish River and returned in April 1776.

In 1776 Sparrman returned to Sweden, where he had been awarded an honorary doctorate in his absence. He was also elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1777. He was appointed keeper of the natural historical collections of the Academy of Sciences in 1780, Professor of natural history and pharmacology in 1781 and assessor of the Collegium Medicum in 1790. In 1790 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. In 1787 he took part in an expedition to West Africa, but this was not successful.

Sparrman published several works, the best known of which is his account of his travels in South Africa and with Cook, published in English as &quot;A voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, towards the Antarctic polar circle, and round the world: But chiefly into the country of the Hottentots and Caffres, from the year 1772 to 1776&quot; (1789). He also published a &quot;Catalogue of the Museum Carlsonianum&quot; (1786–89), in which he described many of the specimens he had collected in South Africa and the South Pacific, some of which were new to science. He published an &quot;Ornithology of Sweden&quot; in 1806.

The asteroid 16646 Sparrman bears his name. In New Zealand, he is commemorated by Mount Sparrman. The Swedish novelist Per Wästberg has written a biographical novel about Sparrman which was published in English in 2010, under the title as &quot;The Journey of Anders Sparrman&quot;. Anders Erikson Sparrman is denoted by the author abbreviation Sparrm. when citing a botanical name.

<doc id="458549" wikidata="Q707695" url="?curid=458549" title="Josiah Child">
<text>Sir Josiah Child, 1st Baronet, (c. 1630/31 – 22 June 1699) was an English economist, merchant and politician. He was an economist proponent of mercantilism and governor of the East India Company. He led the company in the Anglo-Mughal War.

==Early life==
Child was born around 1630–31 and christened in St Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange on 27 February 1630–31, the second son of Richard Child, a merchant of Fleet Street (buried 1639 at Hackney), and Elizabeth Roycroft of Weston Wick, Shropshire. After serving his apprenticeship in the family business, after much struggle, he succeeded. At about age 25, he started on his own account at Portsmouth as victualler to the Navy under the Commonwealth; he is also described as &quot;agent to the Navy Treasurer&quot;. 

He amassed a comfortable fortune, and became a considerable stock-holder in the East India Company. In 1659, he was elected Member of Parliament for Petersfield in the Third Protectorate Parliament. He was elected MP for Dartmouth in 1673 in a by-election to the Cavalier Parliament.

==Purchase of Wanstead Manor==

Child purchased Wanstead Manor in Essex in 1673 from the executors of Sir Robert Brooke and spent much money on laying out the grounds of the manor house, Wanstead Hall. The diarist John Evelyn made the following characteristically waspish entry for 16 March 1683

&quot;I went to see Sir Josiah Child&#x27;s prodigious cost in planting of walnut trees about his seat and making fishponds many miles in circuit in Epping Forest in a barren spot as commonly these overgrown and suddenly monied men for the most part seat themselves. He from an ordinary merchant&#x27;s apprentice &amp; management of the East India Company&#x27;s common stock being arrived to an estate (&#x27;tis said) of £200,000 and lately married his daughter to the eldest son of the Duke of Beaufort, late Marquis of Worcester, with £30,000 (&quot;some versions £50,000&quot;) portion at present, &amp; various expectations. This merchant most sordidly avaricious etc.&quot;

According to Daniel Defoe, Child &quot;added innumerable rows of trees, avenues and vistas to the house, all leading up to the place where the old house stood, as to a centre&quot;.

In 1678, Child was created Baronet Child of Wanstead in the County of Essex. In 1685 he was elected MP for Ludlow. He served as High Sheriff of Essex in 1689.

==Career with the East India Company==
Child&#x27;s advocacy, both by speech and by pen (under the pseudonym &quot;Philopatris)&quot;, of the East India Company&#x27;s claims to political power, as well as to its right of restricting competition to its trade, brought him to the notice of the shareholders. He was appointed a Director in 1677, rising to Deputy-Governor and finally became Governor of the East India Company in 1681. In this latter capacity, he directed the company&#x27;s policy as if it were his own private business. 

He and Sir John Child, president of Surat and governor of Bombay (no relation according to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, arms: &quot;Vert, 2 bars engrailled between 3 leopards&#x27; faces or&quot;) are sometimes credited with the change from unarmed to armed traffic, but the actual renunciation of the Roe doctrine of unarmed traffic by the company was resolved upon in January 1686, under Governor Sir Joseph Ash, when Child was temporarily out of office.

==War with Mughal India==

Child lost the war with Aurangzeb, 6th Mughal Emperor of India, which took place between 1688 and 1690. Aurangzeb, however, did not take any punitive action against the company and restored its trading privileges. &quot;For a massive indemnity and promises of better conduct in the future, he Aurangzeb graciously agreed to the restoration of their East India Company&#x27;s trading privileges and the withdrawal of his troops&quot;.

==Economic philosophy==

Child contributed to the literature of economics, especially &quot;Brief Observations concerning Trade and the Interest of Money&quot; (1668), and &quot;A New Discourse of Trade&quot; (1668 and 1690). He was a moderate in the days of the mercantile system and has sometimes been regarded as a sort of pioneer in developing the free-trade doctrines of the 18th century. Though Child considered himself a proponent of the competitive market, he simultaneously argued for a government-controlled interest rate and restricted trade among the colonies, benefiting England.

He made various proposals for improving English trade by following the Dutch example. He advocated a low rate of interest as the &quot;causa causans&quot; of all the other causes of the riches of the Dutch people. This low rate of interest he thought should be created and maintained by public authority. Child, whilst adhering to the doctrine of the balance of trade, observed that a people cannot always sell to foreigners without ever buying from them, and denied that the export of the precious metals was necessarily detrimental. 

Like other writers in what is commonly called the mercantilist period or tradition, he viewed a numerous population as an asset to a country. He became prominent with a new scheme for the relief and employment of the poor. He also advocated the reservation by the mother country of the sole right of trade with her colonies.

In &quot;Sir Josiah Child&quot;, &quot;Merchant Economist&quot; (1959), William Letwin considers that Child&#x27;s economic thought was of little theoretical importance but notes that he was &quot;the most widely-read of seventeenth-century economic writers&quot;.

==Family==
Child married firstly, Hannah Boate, daughter of Edward Boate, on 26 December 1654 at Portsmouth, Hampshire. He had one surviving child, Elizabeth. Two other children died young. Elizabeth married John Howland of Streatham, and their daughter Elizabeth married the Duke of Bedford.

Child married secondly, c. 14 June 1663, Mary Atwood, daughter of William Atwood. The issues from this marriage are Rebecca (&quot;c.&quot; 1666 – 17 Jul 1712) who married firstly Charles Somerset, Marquess of Worcester and secondly John, Lord Granville); Mary who married Edward Bullock of Faulkbourne and died c. 1748; and his heir Josiah Child, 2nd Baronet (c.1668-20 Jan 1704).

Child married thirdly, c. 8 August 1676, Emma Willughby, widow of Francis Willughby of Wollaton Hall and daughter of Sir Henry Barnard. They had one child, a son, Richard Child (5 Feb 1680 – March 1750), who was created Viscount Castlemaine in 1718 and Earl Tylney in 1731.

Child died on 22 June 1699 and was buried at Wanstead, East London. His will dated 22 February 1696, was proved on 6 July 1699.

==Heraldry==
Although the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states positively that he was not related to the Child &amp; Co bankers of Osterley Park, Burke&#x27;s Armorials 1884 provides evidence to the contrary, giving both families the same armorials: &quot;Gules, a chevron ermine between 3 eagles close argent&quot;. (See Villiers family, Earls of Jersey, into which family the banking Child family married.) The earliest bearer of these Child arms was William Childe, sheriff of Worcestershire in 1585. Burke&#x27;s Armorials, 1884, p. 193. Child &amp; Childe; p. 1057 Villiers, Earls of Jersey.

<text>Sir John Child, 1st Baronet (died 1690) was a governor of Bombay, and de facto (although not officially) the first governor-general of the British settlements in India.

==Life==
Born in London, Child was sent as a child to his uncle, the chief of the factory at Rajapur. on 27 October 1681, he was appointed chief of the East India Company&#x27;s affairs at Surat and Bombay, while at the same time his namesake, stated to be unrelated by the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Sir Josiah Child, was governor of the company at home.

The two men guided the affairs of the company through the period of struggle between the Mughals and Marathas. They have been credited by history with the change from unarmed to armed trade on the part of the company; however, both were actually loath to quarrel with the Mughal Empire. War broke out with Aurangzeb in 1689, but in the following year Child had to sue for peace, one of the conditions being that he should be expelled from India. He escaped this expulsion by his death on 4 February 1690, and was as English president of Surat and Bombay succeeded by Bartholomew Harris.

==Armorials==
Burke&#x27;s Armorials 1884 gives his arms as follows: (Child of Surat, East Indies and Dervill, Essex, bart. created 1684, extinct 1753): &quot;Vert, two bars engrailed between three leopard&#x27;s faces or&quot;. Crest: &quot;A leopard&#x27;s face or between 2 laurel branches proper&quot;. Motto: &quot;Spes Alit&quot; (Hope Nourishes). These arms are in no way similar to those of Sir Josiah Child or Sir Francis Child, of Child &amp; Co bankers, which seems to confirm the lack of any family relationship to the other Child baronetcies.

<doc id="458553" wikidata="Q315861" url="?curid=458553" title="Michel Adanson">
<text>Michel Adanson (7 April 17273 August 1806) was an 18th-century French botanist and naturalist who traveled to Senegal to study flora and fauna. He proposed a &quot;natural system&quot; of taxonomy distinct from the binomial system forwarded by Linnaeus. 

==Personal history==
Adanson was born at Aix-en-Provence. His family moved to Paris in 1730. After leaving the Collège Sainte-Barbe, he was employed in the cabinets of R. A. F. Réaumur and Bernard de Jussieu, as well as in the Jardin des Plantes, Paris. He attended lectures at the Jardin du Roi and the Collège Royal in Paris from 1741 to 1746. At the end of 1748, funded by a director of the Compagnie des Indes, he left France on an exploring expedition to Senegal. He remained there for five years, collecting and describing numerous animals and plants. He also collected specimens of every object of commerce, delineated maps of the country, made systematic meteorological and astronomical observations, and prepared grammars and dictionaries of the languages spoken on the banks of the Sénégal.

After his return to Paris in 1754 he made use of a small portion of the materials he had collected in his &quot;Histoire naturelle du Senegal&quot; (1757). Sales of the work were slow, and after the publisher&#x27;s bankruptcy and the reimbursement to subscribers, Adanson estimated the cost of the book to him had been 5,000 livres, beginning the penury in which he lived the rest of his life. This work has a special interest from the essay on shells, printed at the end of it, where Adanson proposed his universal method, a system of classification distinct from those of Buffon and Linnaeus. He founded his classification of all organised beings on the consideration of each individual organ. As each organ gave birth to new relations, so he established a corresponding number of arbitrary arrangements. Those beings possessing the greatest number of similar organs were referred to one great division, and the relationship was considered more remote in proportion to the dissimilarity of organs.

==Familles naturelles des plantes==
In 1763 he published his &quot;Familles naturelles des plantes&quot;. In this work he developed the principle of arrangement above mentioned, which, in its adherence to natural botanical relations, was based on the system of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, and had been anticipated to some extent nearly a century before by John Ray. The success of this work was hindered by its innovations in the use of terms, which were ridiculed by the defenders of the popular sexual system of Linnaeus; but it did much to open the way for the establishment, by means principally of Antoine Laurent de Jussieu&#x27;s &quot;Genera Plantarum&quot; (1789), of the natural method of the classification of plants.

In 1774 Adanson submitted to the consideration of the French Academy of Sciences an immense work, extending to all known beings and substances. It consisted of 27 large volumes of manuscript, employed in displaying the general relations of all these matters, and their distribution; 150 volumes more, occupied with the alphabetical arrangement of 40,000 species; a vocabulary, containing 200,000 words, with their explanations; and a number of detached memoirs, 40,000 figures and 30,000 specimens of the three kingdoms of nature. The committee to which the inspection of this enormous mass was entrusted strongly recommended Adanson to separate and publish all that was peculiarly his own, leaving out what was merely compilation. He obstinately rejected this advice; and the huge work, at which he continued to labour, was never published.

==Evolution==

Adanson was an early proponent of the inheritance of acquired characters and a limited view of evolution. Historian of science Conway Zirkle has noted that &quot;Adanson was Lamarck&#x27;s predecessor at the Jardin Royal, and Lamarck could hardly have remained unfamiliar with Adanson &#x27;s publications. Adanson not only described evolution in his &quot;Familles de plantes&quot;, published in 1763 when Lamarck was a young man of twenty, but also suggested that the changes in specific characteristics were produced through the inheritance of acquired characters.&quot;

In an article for the &quot;Histoire and Memoires de l&#x27;Academie Royale des Sciences&quot; of 1769, Adanson used the term &quot;mutations&quot; to refer to small changes that could bring about new variations in individuals. Despite being described as a &quot;precursor of evolutionism&quot; by historians, Adanson rejected the concept of species, preferring to focus on individuals and denied the transmutation of species.

Adanson made a serious attempt to classify fungi based on their fruit body complexity. He was the first botanist to classify lichens with fungi.

==Later life==
He had been elected a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1759, and he latterly subsisted on a small pension it had conferred on him. Of this he was deprived in the dissolution of the Academy by the Constituent Assembly in 1793, and was consequently reduced to such a depth of poverty as to be unable to appear before the French Institute when it invited him to take his place among its members. (It is said that he possessed neither a white shirt, a coat nor a whole pair of breeches.) Afterwards he was granted a pension sufficient to relieve his simple wants.

==Death and legacy==
He died in Paris after months of severe suffering, requesting, as the only decoration of his grave, a garland of flowers gathered from the fifty-eight families he had differentiated – &quot;a touching though transitory image,&quot; says Georges Cuvier, &quot;of the more durable monument which he has erected to himself in his works.&quot;

Besides the books already mentioned he published papers on the ship-worm, the baobab tree (whose generic name &quot;Adansonia&quot; commemorates Adanson), the origin of the varieties of cultivated plants, and gum-producing trees.

His papers and herbarium remained in his family&#x27;s hands for over a century and a half, finally coming to the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, in 1961–62. Subsequently, the Hunt Institute republished his &quot;Familles des plantes&quot; in two volumes (1963–64), under the editorship of George H. M. Lawrence.

A species of turtle, &quot;Pelusios adansonii&quot;, is named in his honor.

==In literature==
In The Reverse of the Medal, the eleventh novel in the series and, again, in The Commodore, the seventeenth novel of Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Aubrey-Maturin series, Stephen Maturin makes reference to Adanson. He elaborates on Adanson&#x27;s botanical work in Senegal, the prodigious volume of his written output and his penurious circumstances at the time of his death.
Stephen Maturin: 

David Diop&#x27;s novel &quot;La porte du voyage sans retour&quot; (The door of the voyage without return) was inspired by and is about Adanson&#x27;s experiences in Senegal.

<text>Oberhof is a municipality in the district of Laufenburg in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.

==History==

Oberhof is first mentioned in 1630 as &quot;Oberhoff&quot;. Oberhof was initially part of the municipality of Wölflinswil. From 1408 until 1797 they were part of the Habsburg District of Rheinfelden. In 1797, Oberhof became part of the French protectorate of Fricktal. Then in 1802 it joined the Canton of Fricktal, which became part of the new Canton of Aargau in 1803. When Oberhof joined Aargau, it was separated from Wölflinswil and joined as a separate municipality.

Ecclesiastically, Oberhof has remained part of the parish of Wöflinswil. In 1818, the chapel of St. Joseph (with a late baroque altar) was built. The chapel was renovated in 1975.

==Geography==
Oberhof has an area, , of . Of this area, or 52.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 41.4% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 5.8% is settled (buildings or roads).

Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 2.3% and transportation infrastructure made up 3.3%. Out of the forested land, 39.0% of the total land area is heavily forested and 2.4% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 17.7% is used for growing crops and 30.2% is pastures, while 4.3% is used for orchards or vine crops.

The municipality is located in the Laufenburg district, in the upper &quot;Fricktal&quot; (Frick river valley) and is on the Benkerjoch Pass road. It consists of the &quot;haufendorf&quot; village (an irregular, unplanned and quite closely packed village, built around a central square) of Oberhof and the hamlets of Benken (joined the municipality in 1827) as well as several scattered farm houses.

==Coat of arms==

<text>Zagreb County () is a county in Northern Croatia. It surrounds, but does not contain, the nation&#x27;s capital Zagreb, which is a separate territorial unit. For that reason, the county is often nicknamed &quot;Zagreb ring&quot; (). According to the 2021 census, the county has 299,985 inhabitants, most of whom live in smaller urban satellite towns.

The Zagreb County once included the city of Zagreb, but in 1997 they separated, when the City was given a special status. Although separated from the city of Zagreb both administratively and territorially, it remains closely linked with it.

Zagreb County borders on Krapina-Zagorje County, the city of Zagreb, Varaždin County, and Koprivnica-Križevci County in the north, Bjelovar-Bilogora County in the east, Sisak-Moslavina County in the south and Karlovac County in the southwest as well as Slovenia in the west.

Franjo Tuđman Airport is located on the territory of Zagreb County, the biggest and most important airport in the country.

== Administrative divisions ==

Zagreb County is divided into 9 towns and 25 municipalities.

==County government==

Current Župan: Stjepan Kožić (HSS)

The county assembly is composed of 45 representatives, organized as follows:

* Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ)/Croatian Peasants Party (HSS)/ HSU - 21
* Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP)/Croatian People&#x27;s Party – Liberal Democrats (HNS)/ Democratic Centre (DC) / HSLS - 19

<doc id="458565" wikidata="Q2994934" url="?curid=458565" title="Dimensionless physical constant">
<text>In physics, a dimensionless physical constant is a physical constant that is dimensionless, i.e. a pure number having no units attached and having a numerical value that is independent of whatever system of units may be used.

The concept should not be confused with &quot;dimensionless numbers&quot;, that are not universally constant, and remain constant only for a particular phenomenon. In aerodynamics for example, if one considers one particular airfoil, the Reynolds number value of the laminar–turbulent transition is one relevant dimensionless number of the problem. However, it is strictly related to the particular problem: for example, it is related to the airfoil being considered and also to the type of fluid in which it moves.

The term fundamental physical constant is sometimes used to refer to some dimensionless constants. Perhaps the best-known example is the fine-structure constant, &quot;α&quot;, which has an approximate value of .

== Terminology ==
It has been argued the term &quot;fundamental physical constant&quot; should be restricted to the dimensionless universal physical constants that currently cannot be derived from any other source; this stricter definition is followed here.

However, the term &quot;fundamental physical constant&quot; has also been used occasionally to refer to certain universal dimensioned physical constants, such as the speed of light &quot;c&quot;, vacuum permittivity &quot;ε&quot;0, Planck constant &quot;h&quot;, and the Newtonian constant of gravitation &quot;G&quot;, that appear in the most basic theories of physics. NIST and CODATA sometimes used the term in this less strict manner.

== Characteristics ==
There is no exhaustive list of such constants but it does make sense to ask about the minimal number of fundamental constants necessary to determine a given physical theory. Thus, the Standard Model requires 25 physical constants. About half of them are the masses of fundamental particles, which become &quot;dimensionless&quot; when expressed relative to the Planck mass or, alternatively, as coupling strength with the Higgs field along with the gravitational constant.

Fundamental physical constants cannot be derived and have to be measured. Developments in physics may lead to either a reduction or an extension of their number: discovery of new particles, or new relationships between physical phenomena, would introduce new constants, while the development of a more fundamental theory might allow the derivation of several constants from a more fundamental constant.

A long-sought goal of theoretical physics is to find first principles (theory of everything) from which all of the fundamental dimensionless constants can be calculated and compared to the measured values.

The large number of fundamental constants required in the Standard Model has been regarded as unsatisfactory since the theory&#x27;s formulation in the 1970s. The desire for a theory that would allow the calculation of particle masses is a core motivation for the search for &quot;Physics beyond the Standard Model&quot;.

== History ==
In the 1920s and 1930s, Arthur Eddington embarked upon extensive mathematical investigation into the relations between the fundamental quantities in basic physical theories, later used as part of his effort to construct an overarching theory unifying quantum mechanics and cosmological physics. For example, he speculated on the potential consequences of the ratio of the electron radius to its mass. Most notably, in a 1929 paper he set out an argument based on the Pauli exclusion principle and the Dirac equation that fixed the value of the reciprocal of the fine-structure constant as 𝛼−1 = 16 + × 16 × (16–1) = 136. When its value was discovered to be closer to 137, he changed his argument to match that value. His ideas were not widely accepted, and subsequent experiments have shown that they were wrong (for example, none of the measurements of the fine-structure constant suggest an integer value; the modern CODATA value is 

Though his derivations and equations were unfounded, Eddington was the first physicist to recognize the significance of universal dimensionless constants, now considered among the most critical components of major physical theories such as the Standard Model and ΛCDM cosmology. He was also the first to argue for the importance of the cosmological constant Λ itself, considering it vital for explaining the expansion of the universe, at a time when most physicists (including its discoverer, Albert Einstein) considered it an outright mistake or mathematical artifact and assumed a value of zero: this at least proved prescient, and a significant positive Λ features prominently in ΛCDM.

Eddington may have been the first to attempt in vain to derive the basic dimensionless constants from fundamental theories and equations, but he was certainly not the last. Many others would subsequently undertake similar endeavors, and efforts occasionally continue even today. None have yet produced convincing results or gained wide acceptance among theoretical physicists.

An empirical relation between the masses of the electron, muon and tau has been discovered by physicist Yoshio Koide, but this formula remains unexplained.

== Examples ==
Dimensionless fundamental physical constants include:
* &quot;α&quot;, the fine-structure constant, (≈ ). This is also the square of the electron charge, expressed in Planck units, which defines the scale of charge of elementary particles with charge. The electron charge is the coupling constant for the electromagnetic interaction.
* &quot;μ&quot; or &quot;β&quot;, the proton-to-electron mass ratio (≈ ), the rest mass of the proton divided by that of the electron. More generally, the ratio of the rest masses of any pair of elementary particles.
* &quot;α&quot;s, the coupling constant for the strong force (≈ 1)

=== Fine-structure constant ===
One of the dimensionless fundamental constants is the fine-structure constant:
: formula_1 ,
where &quot;e&quot; is the elementary charge, &quot;ħ&quot; is the reduced Planck constant, &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in vacuum, and &quot;ε&quot;0 is the permittivity of free space. The fine-structure constant is fixed to the strength of the electromagnetic force. At low energies, &quot;α&quot; ≈ , whereas at the scale of the Z boson, about , one measures &quot;α&quot; ≈ . There is no accepted theory explaining the value of &quot;α&quot;; Richard Feynman elaborates:

=== Standard Model ===
The original Standard Model of particle physics from the 1970s contained 19 fundamental dimensionless constants describing the masses of the particles and the strengths of the electroweak and strong forces. In the 1990s, neutrinos were discovered to have nonzero mass, and a quantity called the vacuum angle was found to be indistinguishable from zero.

The complete Standard Model requires 25 fundamental dimensionless constants (Baez, 2011). At present, their numerical values are not understood in terms of any widely accepted theory and are determined only from measurement. These 25 constants are:
* the fine structure constant;
* the strong coupling constant;
* fifteen masses of the fundamental particles (relative to the Planck mass &quot;m&quot;P = ), namely:
** six quarks
** six leptons
** the Higgs boson
** the W boson
** the Z boson
* four parameters of the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix, describing how quarks oscillate between different forms;
* four parameters of the Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata matrix, which does the same thing for neutrinos.

=== Cosmological constants ===
The cosmological constant, which can be thought of as the density of dark energy in the universe, is a fundamental constant in physical cosmology that has a dimensionless value of approximately 10−122. Other dimensionless constants are the measure of homogeneity in the universe, denoted by &quot;Q&quot;, which is explained below by Martin Rees, the baryon mass per photon, the cold dark matter mass per photon and the neutrino mass per photon.

=== Barrow and Tipler ===
Barrow and Tipler (1986) anchor their broad-ranging discussion of astrophysics, cosmology, quantum physics, teleology, and the anthropic principle in the fine-structure constant, the proton-to-electron mass ratio (which they, along with Barrow (2002), call β), and the coupling constants for the strong force and gravitation.

=== Martin Rees&#x27;s &#x27;six numbers&#x27; ===
Martin Rees, in his book &quot;Just Six Numbers&quot;, mulls over the following six dimensionless constants, whose values he deems fundamental to present-day physical theory and the known structure of the universe:
* &quot;N&quot; ≈ 1036: the ratio of the electrostatic and the gravitational forces between two protons. This ratio is denoted &quot;α&quot;/&quot;α&quot;G in Barrow and Tipler (1986). &quot;N&quot; governs the relative importance of gravity and electrostatic attraction/repulsion in explaining the properties of baryonic matter;
* &quot;ε&quot; ≈ 0.007: The fraction of the mass of four protons that is released as energy when fused into a helium nucleus. &quot;ε&quot; governs the energy output of stars, and is determined by the coupling constant for the strong force;
* Ω ≈ 0.3: the ratio of the actual density of the universe to the critical (minimum) density required for the universe to eventually collapse under its gravity. Ω determines the ultimate fate of the universe. If , the universe may experience a Big Crunch. If , the universe may expand forever;
* &quot;λ&quot; ≈ 0.7: The ratio of the energy density of the universe, due to the cosmological constant, to the critical density of the universe. Others denote this ratio by formula_2;
* &quot;Q&quot; ≈ 10−5: The energy required to break up and disperse an instance of the largest known structures in the universe, namely a galactic cluster or supercluster, expressed as a fraction of the energy equivalent to the rest mass &quot;m&quot; of that structure, namely &quot;mc&quot;2;
* &quot;D&quot; = 3: the number of macroscopic spatial dimensions.

&quot;N&quot; and &quot;ε&quot; govern the fundamental interactions of physics. The other constants (&quot;D&quot; excepted) govern the size, age, and expansion of the universe. These five constants must be estimated empirically. &quot;D&quot;, on the other hand, is necessarily a nonzero natural number and does not have an uncertainty. Hence most physicists would not deem it a dimensionless physical constant of the sort discussed in this entry.

Any plausible fundamental physical theory must be consistent with these six constants, and must either derive their values from the mathematics of the theory, or accept their values as empirical.

<text>Krapina-Zagorje County (, ) is a county in northern Croatia, bordering Slovenia. It encompasses most of the historic region called Hrvatsko Zagorje.

The area contains the excavation site of a 100,000-year-old Neanderthal man in caves near the central town of Krapina. The existence of Krapina itself has been verified since 1193, and it has been a common site for castles and other country houses of Croatian, Austrian and Hungarian rulers.

Other towns of the county are Zabok, Pregrada, Zlatar, Oroslavje, Donja Stubica, Klanjec. The town of Stubica features another thermal spring, the Stubičke spa. Also in the area are the medieval castles Veliki Tabor, Miljana, Bežanec, Hellenbach, Milengrad etc.

Krapina-Zagorje County borders on Varaždin County in the northeast, Zagreb County in the southwest and southeast, and the city of Zagreb in the south. The county contains many vineyards. 15% of the year, fog significantly lowers visibility in the area.

<doc id="458577" wikidata="Q57060" url="?curid=458577" title="Sisak-Moslavina County">
<text>Sisak-Moslavina County () is a Croatian county in eastern Central Croatia and southwestern Slavonia. It is named after the city of Sisak and the region Moslavina just across the river Sava. According to 2021 census, it is inhabited by 140,000 people.

This county contains the ancient Roman city of Siscia—today&#x27;s Sisak. Siscia was the largest city of the region back then, a Pannonian capital, likely due to its position on the confluence of the Kupa and Sava rivers. The city&#x27;s patron saint is its first Christian bishop, St. Kvirin, who was tortured and almost killed during Diocletian&#x27;s persecution of Christians. Legend has it that they tied him to a millstone and threw him into a river, but he freed himself from the weight, escaped and continued to preach his faith.

The town may have lost importance with the fall of one empire, but it recovered it soon enough with the rise of another: Sisak became famous for crucial battles between European armies and the Ottoman Turks. In particular, the battle of 1593 when the Ottoman army first suffered a large defeat. The ban Toma Bakač Erdedi who led the defense in this battle became famous throughout Europe.

Today, Sisak features the largest Croatian metallurgic factory (supported by the University of Zagreb&#x27;s Faculty of Metallurgy also in the city) and the largest oil refinery. These are coupled with the petrochemical facilities in the nearby town of Kutina, the first recorded mention of which was in 1256 by king Béla IV. Moslavina is probably the most picturesque part of this county, with the natural park Lonjsko polje near the rivers Lonja, Ilova and Pakra.

This county also extends far to the south, bordering Bosnia. In this southern part of the county, one can find the small town of Topusko, which boasts one of the spas typical of Central Croatia, although this one&#x27;s seniority stands out because it dates back to the neolithic age.

Sisak-Moslavina County borders Karlovac County in the west, Zagreb County in the north, Bjelovar-Bilogora County and Požega-Slavonia County in the northeast, and Brod-Posavina County in the east.

==Administrative division==

Sisak-Moslavina county is subdivided as follows:

==Demographics==

==Politics==
===Minority councils and representatives===

At the 2023 Croatian national minorities councils and representatives elections Bosniaks, Roma and Serbs of Croatia all fulfilled legal requirements to elect their own 25-member minority councils of the Sisak-Moslavina County while Czechs, Slovaks, Italians and Ukrainians of Croatia were electing individual representatives with representative of the Albanians of Croatia remaining unelected due to the absence of candidatures. Some municipalities, towns or cities in the county elected their own local minority councils as well.

<doc id="458582" wikidata="Q58026" url="?curid=458582" title="Koprivnica-Križevci County">
<text>Koprivnica-Križevci County ( ; ) is a county in Northern Croatia. Its hyphenated name comes from two entities: the two of its largest cities, Koprivnica and Križevci; Koprivnica is the official capital of the county.

The county also includes a third town, Đurđevac, but its population is much smaller than the main two (8,862 in 2001).

The Koprivnica-Križevci County borders on the Međimurje County in the north, Varaždin County in the northwest, Zagreb County in the southwest, Bjelovar-Bilogora County in the south, Virovitica-Podravina County in the southeast and Hungary in the east.

==History==
Koprivnica was first mentioned in 1272 in a document by prince Ladislaus IV of Hungary and was declared a free royal town by king Ludovic I in 1356. It has flourished as a trading place and a military fortress since that time.

The military aspect set it back when it was included in the Croatian Military Frontier in the 16th century during the wars with the Ottoman Turks. After Maria Theresa&#x27;s decree of 1765, however, it resumed life as a peaceful little merchant town.

Koprivnica developed significantly in the 20th century with the advent of the Podravka food industry, and is known worldwide for its Vegeta spice.

Križevci, on the other hand, as a smaller city and second mentioned in the county name, may seem like an underdog to its neighbour Koprivnica. Its first mention was from 1193 by Béla III but it was divided into two parts which developed at different rates.

After centuries of division, empress Maria Theresa united the Lower and Upper Križevac into Križevci in 1752. The town was also hit by the wars with the Turks, but it regained importance in 1871 when the railway was built through it on the way from Budapest to Rijeka.

Modern Križevci is oriented towards entrepreneurship, while preserving its eight beautiful churches (one of which is a cathedral), built mostly in the Middle Ages.

==Administrative division==
Koprivnica-Križevci county is divided into:

* City of Koprivnica (county seat)

==Political career==
He began his political career when he was elected a member of Cork County Council in 1974, remaining on the council until the 1991 local elections. He was elected to Dáil Éireann on his first attempt when he was returned as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Cork South-West at the 1977 general election. Walsh lost his seat at the 1981 general election but secured election by the Cultural and Educational Panel to Seanad Éireann. He was re-elected to the Dáil at the February 1982 general election and retained his seat at every subsequent election until his retirement in 2007.

In the 1980s, Walsh was one of the Gang of 22 who opposed Charles Haughey&#x27;s leadership of Fianna Fáil. Despite this, he was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food when Haughey returned as Taoiseach after the 1987 general election. In 1989, he was a key figure in the negotiations which led to the formation of the historic Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition government. He remained as Minister of State until 1992 when Albert Reynolds became Taoiseach. Walsh was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister for Agriculture and Food in February of the same year. He remained in that position until December 1994. In 1997, Fianna Fáil returned to power, and Walsh was again appointed Minister for Agriculture and Food in Bertie Ahern&#x27;s government.

When Ireland was confronted with a foot-and-mouth disease crisis in 2001, Walsh introduced control measures to prevent a full-scale outbreak, such as curtailing the movement of animals during football games and postponing sports events, including the 2001 Six Nations Championship.

He received several awards, including the Légion d&#x27;honneur and the Grand Cross of the Agricultural Order of Merit of Spain. On 13 August 2004, he announced that he would retire from the Cabinet after spending 14 years of his career at the Department of Agriculture.

He sat on the board of the Bank of Ireland and received annual Oireachtas pension payments of €119,177.

==Death==
Walsh died at Cork University Hospital on 9 November 2014, after a &quot;short illness&quot;.

<text>The title Baron Berkeley originated as a feudal title and was subsequently created twice in the Peerage of England by writ. It was first granted by writ to Thomas de Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley (1245–1321), 6th feudal Baron Berkeley, in 1295, but the title of that creation became extinct at the death of his great-great-grandson, the fifth Baron by writ, when no male heirs to the barony by writ remained, although the feudal barony continued. The next creation by writ was in 1421, for the last baron&#x27;s nephew and heir James Berkeley. His son and successor William was created Viscount Berkeley in 1481, Earl of Nottingham in 1483, and Marquess of Berkeley in 1488. He had no surviving male issue, so the Marquessate and his other non-inherited titles became extinct on his death in 1491, whilst the barony passed &quot;de jure&quot; to his younger brother Maurice. However, William had disinherited Maurice because he considered him to have brought shame on the noble House of Berkeley by marrying beneath his status to Isabel, daughter of Philip Mead of Wraxhall, an Alderman and Mayor of Bristol. Instead, he bequeathed the castle, lands and lordships comprising the Barony of Berkeley to King Henry VII and his heirs male, failing which to descend to William&#x27;s own rightful heirs. Thus on the death of King Edward VI in 1553, Henry VII&#x27;s unmarried grandson, the Berkeley inheritance returned to the family. Therefore, Maurice and his descendants from 1492 to 1553 were &quot;de jure&quot; barons only, until the return of the title to the senior heir Henry (and indirectly to his mother Anne), becoming &quot;de facto&quot; 7th Baron in 1553. Upon his death he was succeeded by his relative George Harding.

His son, the ninth Baron, was created in 1679 Earl of Berkeley and Viscount Dursley, which remained united to the barony until the death of the sixth Earl in 1882, when the earldom passed to a male heir and the barony passed to a female one, Louisa Milman. At Louisa&#x27;s death, the barony went to Eva Mary Foley, upon whose death the barony fell into abeyance. The abeyance was terminated a few years later in favour of Mary Lalle Foley-Berkeley. Upon her death, the barony went to her nephew Anthony Gueterbock, who is the present holder. In 2000, he was created Baron Gueterbock for life in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The epithets of each baron were coined by John Smith of Nibley (d.1641), steward of the Berkeley estates, the biographer of the family and author of &quot;Lives of the Berkeleys&quot;.

==Feudal Barons of Berkeley==

The feudal barony of Berkeley was created , when King Henry II granted the royal castle of Berkeley to the Anglo-Saxon royal financier Robert Fitzharding under the feudal land tenure .

Prior to that time, Berkeley Castle had been held in fee-farm by Roger I &quot;de Berkeley&quot; (d.1093), a Norman nobleman, possibly a son of Roger I of Tosny (died ), who acquired the surname &quot;de Berkeley&quot;. Roger I &quot;de Berkeley&quot; held extensive lands in-chief of the king in 1086, as recorded by Domesday Book, including Dursley and retired as a monk to St Peter&#x27;s Abbey, Gloucester in about 1091. His son Roger II (d. about 1131) and grandson Roger III (d. after 1177) also held the manor of Dursley in-chief of the king. In 1152 Roger III was deprived of the farm of Berkeley during the civil war between King Stephen and the Empress Maud. He was later restored to Dursley, and founded the family of &quot;Berkeley of Dursley&quot;, but Berkeley Castle was granted by barony to Robert FitzHarding, a native Englishman and royal financier of Bristol, whose family also took the name &quot;de Berkeley&quot;. To mollify the ill feelings of Roger of Dursley, Henry II encouraged each family to marry their respective male heirs to the eldest daughters of the other, which was successfully accomplished. The epithets below were assigned by John Smith (d.1640) of Nibley, household steward of the Berkeleys and author of &quot;Lives of the Berkeleys&quot;:

*Robert FitzHarding, 1st feudal baron of Berkeley (d.1170/1) &quot;Robert the Devout&quot;.
*Maurice FitzRobert FitzHarding, 2nd feudal baron of Berkeley (–1190/1) (otherwise &quot;Maurice I de Berkeley&quot;) &quot;Maurice the Make-Peace&quot;, son, who in accordance with the wishes of King Henry II married Alice de Berkeley, eldest daughter of Roger III &quot;de Berkeley&quot; (d. after 1177) of Dursley.
*Robert de Berkeley, 3rd feudal baron of Berkeley (–1220) &quot;Robert the Rebellious&quot;, son
*Thomas I de Berkeley, 4th feudal baron of Berkeley (–1243) &quot;Thomas the Observer or Temporiser&quot;, brother
*Maurice II de Berkeley, 5th feudal baron of Berkeley (1218–1281) &quot;Maurice the Resolute&quot;, son

==Barons Berkeley, by writ, First Creation (1295)==
From 1295 the feudal barony continued concurrently with the barony by writ. The feudal barony continued until the Tenures Abolition Act 1660. The feudal barony of Berkeley is especially important in that the barony by writ was deemed, extraordinarily, to be in effect a feudal barony (or barony by tenure), dependent on the tenure of Berkeley Castle. Thus when William Berkeley, 1st Marquess of Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley (1426–1492), &quot;William the Waste-All&quot;, alienated Berkeley Castle to the king, he effectively disinherited his younger brother from the barony by writ.
*Thomas de Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley, 6th feudal baron of Berkeley (1245–1321) &quot;Thomas the Wise&quot;, son.
*Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley, 7th feudal baron of Berkeley (1271–1326), &quot;Maurice the Magnanimous&quot;, son.
*Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley, 8th feudal baron of Berkeley (1293/6–1361) &quot;Thomas the Rich&quot;, son.
*Maurice de Berkeley, 4th Baron Berkeley, 9th feudal baron of Berkeley (1320–1368) &quot;Maurice the Valiant&quot;, son.
*Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley, 10th feudal baron of Berkeley (1353–1417) &quot;Thomas the Magnificent&quot;, son, died without male progeny.

==Barons Berkeley, by writ, Second Creation (1421)==
*James Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley (–1463), &quot;James the Just&quot;, nephew and heir male.
*William Berkeley, 1st Marquess of Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley (1426–1492), &quot;William the Waste-All&quot;, son.
*Maurice Berkeley, &quot;de jure&quot; 3rd Baron Berkeley (1436–1506), &quot;Maurice the Lawyer&quot;, brother.
*Maurice Berkeley, &quot;de jure&quot; 4th Baron Berkeley (1467–1523), &quot;Maurice the Courtier&quot;, son. Died without legitimate progeny.
*Thomas Berkeley, &quot;de jure&quot; 5th Baron Berkeley (1472–1533), &quot;Thomas the Sheepmaster&quot;, brother.
*Thomas Berkeley, &quot;de jure&quot; 6th Baron Berkeley (1505–1534), &quot;Thomas the Hopeful&quot;, son.
*Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley (1534–1613), &quot;Henry the Harmless / Posthumous Henry&quot;, posthumous son.
*George Berkeley, 8th Baron Berkeley (1601–1658), grandson. (No epithets coined after the death of John Smith (d.1640) of Nibley)
*George Berkeley, 1st Earl of Berkeley, 9th Baron Berkeley (1627–1698), son (created Earl of Berkeley in 1679)
*Charles Berkeley, 2nd Earl of Berkeley, 10th Baron Berkeley (1649–1710)
*James Berkeley, 3rd Earl of Berkeley, 11th Baron Berkeley (1680–1736)
*Augustus Berkeley, 4th Earl of Berkeley, 12th Baron Berkeley (1716–1755)
*Frederick Augustus Berkeley, 5th Earl of Berkeley, 13th Baron Berkeley (1745–1810)
*Thomas Moreton Fitzhardinge Berkeley, 6th Earl of Berkeley, 14th Baron Berkeley (1796–1882)
*Louisa Mary Milman, 15th Baroness Berkeley (by birth: Berkeley) (1840–1899)
*Eva Mary Foley, 16th Baroness Berkeley (by birth: Milman) (1875–1964) (abeyant 1964)
*Mary Lalle Foley-Berkeley, 17th Baroness Berkeley (1905–1992) (abeyance terminated 1967)
*Anthony Fitzhardinge Gueterbock, 18th Baron Berkeley (b. 1939), her nephew

The heir apparent is his son Thomas FitzHardinge Gueterbock (b. 1969)

==Earls of Berkeley (after 1882, continuing the creation of 1679)==
The Earldom of Berkeley, together with the Viscountcy of Dursley, was separated from the barony in 1882, but the succession was not fully established. In 1942 both titles became extinct or dormant.

*George Lennox Rawdon Berkeley, 7th Earl of Berkeley (1827–1888), son of George Berkeley, who was a grandson of the 4th Earl
*Randal Thomas Mowbray Berkeley, 8th Earl of Berkeley (1865–1942) (dormant 1942)

<doc id="458618" wikidata="Q1278780" url="?curid=458618" title="Southern Cross University">
<text>Southern Cross University (SCU) is an Australian public university, with campuses at Lismore and Coffs Harbour in northern New South Wales, and at Coolangatta, the most southern suburb of the Gold Coast in Queensland. In 2019, it was ranked in the top 100 young universities in the world by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.

== History ==
The initial predecessor institution to Southern Cross University was the Lismore Teachers&#x27; College, which commenced operation on 23 February 1970, at what is now the Northern Rivers Conservatorium site. On 1 September 1971, the Lismore Teachers College became a College of Advanced Education, under the Higher Education Act 1969, with the institution soon renamed Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education in 1973. Dr (later Professor) Rod Treyvaud was appointed principal in 1984, and oversaw an extensive building programme and the introduction of six new degree courses.

Following the publication of the Commonwealth Government&#x27;s White Paper on Higher Education in 1988 and its emphasis on the development of larger tertiary education institutions in Australia, Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education agreed to an association with the University of New England (UNE). On 17 July 1989 the Northern Rivers CAE thus became part of network University of New England, with some 1800 staff and some 9500 EFTSU (effective full-time student units).

There was however dissatisfaction with the new network university, and on 29 June 1993 the federal and state ministers for education jointly announced that a new university would be established in the North Coast of NSW, which would consist of campuses at Lismore (formerly UNE - Northern Rivers) and Coffs Harbour (formerly UNE - Coffs Harbour Centre). It was subsequently announced that the new institution would be called Southern Cross University. Appropriate legislation was passed by both houses of the New South Wales Parliament in October 1993, and received the Royal Assent on 9 November 1993. Southern Cross University was formally established on 1 January 1994.

In 2010, Southern Cross University opened a new campus in the southern Gold Coast area of Queensland, at Coolangatta just 400 metres from North Kirra Beach and adjacent to the Gold Coast International Airport. Views of the Pacific Ocean can be seen from many vantage points in the campus&#x27; buildings. The Foundation Building was opened in 2010 and a second 10-story building opened in February 2013.

In 2019 a new health sciences building was opened at the Coffs Harbour campus funded from the Australian Government’s Community Development Grants program. Degrees in nursing, midwifery, occupational therapy and sport exercise science are offered in the new space.

<doc id="458625" wikidata="Q808603" url="?curid=458625" title="Baron Byron">
<text>Baron Byron, of Rochdale in the County Palatine of Lancaster, is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1643 by letters patent for Sir John Byron, a Cavalier general and former Member of Parliament. The peerage was created with remainder to the heirs male of his body, failing, to his six brothers: Richard, William, Thomas, Robert, Gilbert, and Philip, and the heirs male of their bodies. Lord Byron died childless and was succeeded according to the special remainder by his next eldest brother Richard, the second Baron.

The latter&#x27;s great-grandson, the fifth Baron, killed his cousin and neighbour William Chaworth in a duel on 26 January 1765. He was brought before his peers in the House of Lords but under the statute of Edward VI he was found guilty only of manslaughter and forced to pay a small fine. Byron henceforth became known as &quot;the Wicked Lord&quot; and &quot;the Devil Byron&quot;.

He was succeeded by his great-nephew, George Gordon Byron, the sixth Baron, the famous Romantic poet. He was the son of John &quot;Mad Jack&quot; Byron, son of Vice-Admiral John &quot;Foulweather Jack&quot; Byron, second son of the fourth Baron and the younger brother of the fifth Baron. Lord Byron died without male issue and was succeeded by his first cousin, the seventh Baron, who was an admiral in the Royal Navy.

On the death of his great-grandson, the eleventh Baron (who had succeeded his first cousin once-removed in 1949), this line of the family expired. The late Baron was succeeded by his distant relative (his fifth cousin), the twelfth Baron. He was the great-great-great-grandson of Reverend Richard Byron, third son of the fourth Baron. As of 2009, the title is held by his second son, the thirteenth Baron, who succeeded in 1989.

From the 16th century until 1818, the family residence of the Lords Byron was Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire. Most of the Byrons—including the sixth baron&#x27;s daughter, the famed mathematician Ada Lovelace—are buried in the family vault in the nearby Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Hucknall.

<text>Wilbert Ross Thatcher, (May 24, 1917 – July 22, 1971) was a Canadian politician who served as the ninth premier of Saskatchewan from 1964 to 1971. Thatcher began his career as a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in 1942, elected first to Moose Jaw City Council and then in 1945 as a Member of Parliament representing Moose Jaw. In 1959, Thatcher made the switch both to Saskatchewan provincial politics and to the provincial Liberal Party, which he led through four provincial elections, winning majority governments in 1964 and 1967. Following his defeat in the 1971 provincial election, Thatcher retired from politics and died shortly afterwards.

==Early life and career==
Born in Neville, Saskatchewan, Thatcher was a Moose Jaw-based businessman, who developed an interest in politics shortly after the birth of his son, Colin Thatcher. Thatcher&#x27;s father had built a chain of hardware stores across the province, which Thatcher helped to manage.

Thatcher graduated from high school at age fifteen, and attended Queen&#x27;s University, in Kingston, Ontario, where he earned a commerce degree at age eighteen. Immediately following graduation, Thatcher became executive assistant to the vice-president of Canada Packers in Toronto, but returned to Saskatchewan to run the family business after his father had become ill in the late 1930s. By this time, the family business included outlets in Regina and Saskatoon as well as the original Moose Jaw store. Thatcher employed his siblings to assist him.

In the late 1950s, Thatcher transitioned away from hardware and into farming and cattle ranching in the Moose Jaw area. He employed his son Colin as a full-time manager of his agricultural businesses, starting in 1962.

==Political career==
===CCF and Member of Parliament (1942–57)===
Thatcher&#x27;s politics were heavily influenced by the Great Depression, after which he believed that private business alone could not stimulate economic development on the prairies. Thatcher consequently joined the socialist Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and was elected to Moose Jaw City Council on a labour-reform slate in 1942. In the 1945 Canadian federal election, Thatcher was elected to Parliament representing Moose Jaw.

Thatcher grew increasingly uncomfortable in the CCF. Despite the party itself moderating its socialist foundations and embracing a mixed-economy model, Thatcher consistently found himself on the pro-business right wing of the party caucus. He gradually shifted away from the party, and became known for publicly breaking ranks with the CCF on policy issues. In 1955, Thatcher finally left the CCF over the issue of corporate taxation. When he left the caucus, Thatcher pronounced that he was &quot;opposed to Socialism and all it stands for&quot;. He sat as an Independent MP for the rest of the term, before running unsuccessfully for the federal Liberal Party in the 1957 and 1958 elections; he lost both times to the CCF&#x27;s Hazen Argue.

===Mossbank debate and provincial politics (1957–64)===
During the 1957 federal campaign, Thatcher attacked the Saskatchewan CCF government&#x27;s affinity for crown corporations, describing them as a dismal failure. In response, Saskatchewan Premier Tommy Douglas challenged Thatcher to a debate, which ultimately took place in the town of Mossbank and was broadcast by television and radio across the province. The debate was widely regarded as a draw. However, the Liberals were buoyed by Thatcher holding his own against Douglas, who was renowned for his oratory. The debate established Thatcher as the province&#x27;s principal CCF antagonist and free enterprise standard-bearer, and gave Liberals hope that they might challenge for government against the popular CCF.

After his defeats at the federal level, Thatcher was courted by the Saskatchewan Liberal Party and became its leader in 1959, defeating three rivals—Wilf Gardiner, Frank Foley, and Alex Cameron—in a contested leadership election. While some in the party resented Thatcher&#x27;s quick ascension to the leadership over long-time Liberals, his victory also created excitement among the party ranks. Thatcher led the party into the 1960 provincial election, which was fought principally over the issue of Medicare, with the CCF planning to implement the first universal healthcare plan in Canada. The Liberals campaigned against Medicare, finding that they could not make a significant dent in the Saskatchewan CCF&#x27;s large majority. Thatcher himself was elected to the Legislative Assembly from the rural southern riding of Morse.

The Liberals had gained momentum, however, and the anti-CCF opposition coalesced around them. This was particularly evident during the 1962 Saskatchewan doctors&#x27; strike, which attempted to derail the implementation of Medicare and hurt the CCF&#x27;s popularity. In addition, Douglas, premier since 1944, stepped down in November 1961 after he was elected leader of the nascent federal New Democratic Party. The Liberals won a string of by-elections over the following three years in the lead up to the next general election.

===Premier of Saskatchewan (1964–71)===
Ahead of the 1964 provincial election, the Liberals campaigned on growing economic development in the province; Thatcher also wooed Progressive Conservative voters and worked to limit competition between free-enterprise candidates. Thatcher&#x27;s Liberals went on to win a narrow victory that ended 20 years of CCF-NDP government. The popular vote was a virtual tie between the Liberals and the CCF; however, the distribution of the Liberals&#x27; votes and a sharp decline in Social Credit support allowed the Liberals to win a six-seat majority, making Thatcher the province&#x27;s sixth Liberal premier and ninth overall.

Thatcher&#x27;s government sold several crown corporations and declared the province &quot;open for business&quot; by encouraging private investment in the potash and other industries. His approach to potash led to a rapid expansion of the industry in the latter half of the 1960s—the industry grew so rapidly that Thatcher eventually opted to negotiate a minimum price and production cap with American producers to avoid prices collapsing from oversupply. Thatcher was known to boast that potash would become for Saskatchewan what oil was for neighbouring Alberta. On economic issues, Thatcher&#x27;s government was classically liberal, and was well to the right of the federal Liberals. Thatcher often clashed with the federal Liberal governments of Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau over agricultural policy, social welfare policies—which the federal party supported and Thatcher opposed—and constitutional reform, as well as the federal Liberals&#x27; attempts to form a federal political organization in the province separate from the provincial party.

Thatcher also focused on downsizing the province&#x27;s robust civil service. During Thatcher&#x27;s tenure, veteran Saskatchewan civil servants were known to move to other provinces or to the federal civil service—which at the time was expanding the federal welfare state—and these migrants became known in government circles as the &quot;Saskatchewan Mafia&quot;. Thatcher himself became renowned for being a &quot;ruthless&quot; leader that &quot;ruled the Liberal caucus with an iron fist&quot; and ran what came to be seen as a &quot;one-man government&quot;.

Thatcher&#x27;s Liberals were re-elected with a slightly-increased majority in a snap election called in 1967. Thatcher then surprised observers by introducing an austerity program, which cut government services, increased taxes, and introduced medicare user fees. The provincial economy, which was still heavily resource-based, experienced a downturn, and reduced government investment hurt both the potash and agriculture industries, while oil and uranium production dropped as well. Thatcher&#x27;s administration became increasingly unpopular as a result. Thatcher pitched the next election, which took place in June 1971, as a stark choice between capitalism and socialism, promising for his part to continue running government like a business. For their part, the NDP campaigned on increasing public ownership of resources and state-led development. Although the Liberal vote share remained steady, they were defeated by Allan Blakeney&#x27;s NDP, who were helped by an increased voter turnout and the collapse of the Progressive Conservative vote. David Steuart, Thatcher&#x27;s top cabinet minister who would succeed him as Liberal leader later that year, quipped after the loss that, &quot;If there was someone or some group that we hadn&#x27;t alienated by the election of 1971, it was because we hadn&#x27;t met them yet.&quot;

In the aftermath of the election, Thatcher announced to the party that he intended to resign as Liberal leader, placing a one-year limit on the search for a successor.

==Death==
In July 1971, only weeks after his election defeat, Thatcher died at his home in Regina, apparently as a result of complications from diabetes and a heart condition. His death shocked the Saskatchewan public, and JoAnn Thatcher, then-wife of the former premier&#x27;s son Colin Thatcher, later claimed she suspected the death was a suicide. However, it was an open secret that Thatcher had largely refused to deal with his diabetes. A former aide told reporters that Thatcher&#x27;s health had been so run down that his death from natural causes surprised few insiders.

==Family==
Thatcher&#x27;s widow, Peggie Thatcher, was persuaded to run for the federal Liberals in the 1972 federal election, but came third in the Regina East riding.

===Colin Thatcher===
In the 1975 provincial election, Colin Thatcher was elected in Thunder Creek, a new constituency that contained parts of the riding that his father had represented. Although he was first elected as a Liberal, he later crossed the floor to the Progressive Conservatives before joining government after the PCs won the 1982 provincial election. Thatcher resigned in January 1983 following a brief stint as a cabinet minister in the PC government; his ex-wife JoAnn Wilson was found murdered days later, and in 1984 Thatcher was charged with murder for her death. He was convicted of first degree murder by the jury in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench and sentenced to life in prison for 25 years. His appeals to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada were dismissed.

==Electoral history==
Thatcher ranks eighth out of the fifteen Saskatchewan premiers for time in office at . He was the sixth and last Liberal premier of the province. Thatcher led the Liberal Party in four provincial elections, in 1960, 1964, 1967 and 1971; he was defeated in his first election in 1960—he was Leader of the Opposition from 1960 to 1964—but won the next two elections in 1964 and 1967 with majority governments. Following his defeat in the general election of 1971, he was succeeded as Premier by Allan Blakeney, leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP).

<doc id="458630" wikidata="Q4862195" url="?curid=458630" title="Baron Braye">
<text>Baron Braye, of Eaton Bray in the County of Bedford, is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1529 for Edmund Braye, 1st Baron Braye. However, the family originally originate from Normandy, they are direct descendants of Chevalier Baudry de Bray who came over to England in the Battle of Hastings of 1066. The family&#x27;s local area in Leicestershire played host to two battles in England of note, the Battle of Bosworth Field where the current family&#x27;s ancestor&#x27;s were on opposing sides, and also Battle of Naseby during the First English Civil War, where the old manor house hosted King Charles I. 
The barony was created by writ, which means that it can descend through both male and female lines. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He died from wounds received at the Battle of St Quentin in 1557. Lord Braye was childless and on his death the title fell into abeyance between his sisters.

It remained in abeyance for 282 years until the abeyance was terminated in 1839 in favour of Sarah Otway-Cave, who became the third Baroness Braye, which was granted by Queen Victoria. She was the wife of Henry Otway and only daughter of Sir Thomas Cave, 6th Baronet, of Stanford, grandson of Sir Thomas Cave, 3rd Baronet, of Stanford, and his wife Margaret Verney, daughter of John Verney, 1st Viscount Fermanagh, great-great-grandson of Elizabeth Verney, second daughter of the first Baron Braye, and her husband Sir Ralph Verney. In 1819 she assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Cave. And also she inherited Stanford hall in Leicestershire which is a family home but also open to the public for private, weddings and corporate events for a short stay.

When she died in 1862 the barony fell into abeyance between her four daughters. In 1879 the abeyance was terminated in favour of the last surviving daughter, Henrietta, the fourth Baroness. She was the wife of Reverend Edgell Wyatt-Edgell. She was succeeded by her fourth but eldest surviving son, the fifth Baron. In 1880 he assumed by Royal licence the surname of Verney-Cave in lieu of Wyatt-Edgell. As of 2010 the title is held by his great-granddaughter, the eighth Baroness, who succeeded her father in 1985. She is the wife of Edward Henry Lancelot Aubrey-Fletcher, fourth son of Sir Henry Aubrey-Fletcher, 6th Baronet. They have no children. Lady Braye is heir-general of the Verney family (see the Earl Verney).

The family seat is Stanford Hall near Lutterworth, Leicestershire.

<text>The London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) was a quango agency set up by the UK Government in 1981 to regenerate the depressed Docklands area of east London. During its seventeen-year existence, it was responsible for regenerating an area of in the London Boroughs of Newham, Tower Hamlets and Southwark. LDDC helped to create Canary Wharf, Surrey Quays Shopping Centre, London City Airport, ExCeL London, London Arena and the Docklands Light Railway, bringing more than 120,000 new jobs to the Docklands and making the area highly sought after for housing. Although initially fiercely resisted by local councils and residents, today it is generally regarded as having been a success and is now used as an example of large-scale regeneration, although tensions between older and more recent residents remain.

== Background ==
London&#x27;s Docklands were at one time the largest and most successful in the world. The West India Docks which were opened in 1802 were followed by the London Docks, East India Docks, and St Katherine&#x27;s Dock in the years afterwards and Surrey Docks, Millwall Dock and the Royal Docks in the rest of the 19th century. In 1909, after a number of mergers and collapses, the Port of London Authority was established to manage the docks. Tens of thousands of people were employed by the docks, as well as other nearby related industries, such as flour mills.

During World War II, the docks area was heavily bombed during the Blitz, in an attempt to destroy London&#x27;s economy and weaken the war effort. This damaged or destroyed much of the docklands infrastructure, as well as almost a third of the area&#x27;s housing.

There was a brief resurgence during the 1950s but the docks were empty by 1980. The main reason was containerisation: goods used to be brought into the UK by relatively small ships and unloaded by hand; from the 1970s onwards most trade was carried within intermodal containers (shipping containers) or by truck on roll-on/roll-off ferries.

Between 1961 and 1971, almost 83,000 jobs were lost in the five boroughs in the Docklands area (Greenwich, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Southwark). A large percentage of the jobs which were lost were from large transnational corporations which had previously provided good job security. The decline was heightened by government policies which favoured the growth of industry outside London.

The housing in the Docklands area was nearly all council-owned terraced housing and flats. There was no commercial infrastructure such as banks or building societies or any new office accommodation.

== Formation ==
The London Docklands Development Corporation was established by the then Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Heseltine, under section 135 of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980. It was financed by a grant from central government and from the proceeds from the disposal of land for development.

The corporation acted as a catalyst benefiting from the full range of planning authority powers (principally those of development control).

Additionally, the Government set up an Enterprise Zone with certain tax breaks in the area.

== Operation 1981–1994 ==

LDDC&#x27;s first chief executive was Reg Ward, a former chief executive of Hereford and Worcester County Council and Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council. Ward said if he had created some grand plan...&quot;we would still be debating and nothing would have got built. Instead, we have gone for an organic, market-driven approach, responding pragmatically to each situation.&quot;

Billingsgate Market had relocated from the City to Docklands in 1982, and this was thought to be typical of the type of industry which might be accommodated.

However, Docklands was close to the City of London and this made it an attractive secondary office location as well as a possible site for riverside residential development to accommodate the phenomenon of yuppies, the young high-income single-person households created by new jobs in the financial services industry. In the first few years of LDDC&#x27;s operation several offices and flats schemes were given the go ahead including on Heron Quays and Surrey Quays. Many of these buildings demonstrated unique architecture, such as the Baltic Quay building in the Surrey Docks.

LDDC&#x27;s success was due to seizing opportunity and making maximum use of its assets. When faced with a large amount of redundant railway infrastructure, the LDDC created a cheap light rail scheme, the Docklands Light Railway to make use of it. This in turn made the whole area more accessible to the public and helped create the conditions for further development. 

When American/Swiss banker Michael von Clemm visited West India Docks looking for a restaurant site, he became interested in the idea of building a back office. Reg Ward jumped on this and the resulting scheme became the successful Canary Wharf development. This development far exceeded initial projections for growth in the Royal Docks, and Canary Wharf developer Olympia and York proposed an extension of the Jubilee line to serve the site. Beginning construction in 1993, the Jubilee Line Extension opened in 1999 after the end of the LDDC.

The LDDC tapped into the boom in air travel by creating a small business airport making use of the vast open spaces of the Royal Docks. London City Airport became a fast-growing and popular airport.

During the 1980s private housing was developed in Docklands which with some minor exceptions were the first to be built in the area. Soon many people from outside the area saw the opportunity of buying a house close to the city at what appeared to be cheap prices. On many of the developments, local council tenants were given first opportunities to buy at discounted prices, but this led to a number of abuses.

== Effects outside London ==
The success of the LDDC spurred the government to set up similar bodies elsewhere, for example in Merseyside (1981) and later the Black Country, Cardiff Bay, Trafford Park (Greater Manchester) (all 1987), and the Central Manchester Development Corporation (1988).

== Undemocratic nature ==
One feature of the LDDC was that it was &quot;insulated&quot; from the local democratically elected councils. Eddie Oliver, Deputy Chief Executive (1981–87) agreed that it was undemocratic, explaining that it was an extraordinary arrangement for an extraordinary situation&quot;.

== Withdrawal 1994–1998 ==
The LDDC began a staged withdrawal in 1994. It withdrew from Bermondsey in 1994, followed by Beckton in 1995, the Surrey Docks in 1996, from Wapping, Limehouse and the Isle of Dogs in 1997, and finally from the Royal Docks in late 1998. Under a process called &quot;dedesignation&quot; the powers it held reverted to the London boroughs. It was formally wound up on 31 March 1998.

<doc id="458647" wikidata="Q8021572" url="?curid=458647" title="Willie Horton">
<text>William R. Horton (born August 12, 1951), commonly referred to as &quot;Willie Horton&quot;, is an American convicted murderer who was the subject of a major political controversy in the 1988 presidential election. Horton had committed violent crimes while on furlough from prison, where he was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole for murder. Released for a weekend as the beneficiary of a Massachusetts furlough program, he failed to return, and was later recaptured and convicted of committing assault, armed robbery, and rape in Maryland, where he remains incarcerated.

During the 1988 U.S. presidential election, Vice President and Republican nominee George H. W. Bush brought Horton up frequently during his campaign against Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis who was the governor of Massachusetts. He was commonly referred to as &quot;Willie&quot; Horton, despite never having gone by the nickname. The renaming of the African-American Horton has been speculated to be the product of racist stereotyping.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton 1995 https://archive.org/details/narrativeethics00newt/page/n340 324&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent PAC ad for Bush about Horton has been widely characterized as a textbook example of dog-whistle politics.

==Criminal activity and incarceration==
On October 26, 1974, in Lawrence, Massachusetts, Horton and two accomplices robbed Joseph Fournier, a 17-year-old gas station attendant, and then fatally stabbed Fournier 19 times after he had cooperated by handing over all of the money in the cash register. His body was stuffed in a trash can, with his feet jammed up against his chin. Fournier died from blood loss. Horton was convicted of murder, sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, and incarcerated at the Northeastern Correctional Center in Massachusetts.

On June 6, 1986, Horton was released as part of a weekend furlough program but did not return. On April 3, 1987, in Oxon Hill, Maryland, Horton twice raped a woman after pistol-whipping, stabbing, binding, and gagging her fiancé. He then stole the car belonging to the man he had assaulted. He was later shot by Corporal Paul J. Lopez of the Prince George&#x27;s County Police Department and captured by Corporal Yusuf A. Muhammad of the same department after a pursuit. On October 20, Horton was sentenced in Maryland to two consecutive life terms plus 85 years. The sentencing judge, Vincent J. Femia, refused to return Horton to Massachusetts, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not prepared to take the chance that Mr. Horton might again be furloughed or otherwise released. This man should never draw a breath of free air again.&quot;

==Legislative and political background==
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis was the governor of Massachusetts at the time of Horton&#x27;s release. While he did not start the furlough program, he had supported it as a method of criminal rehabilitation. The state inmate furlough program, originally signed into law by Republican governor Francis Sargent in 1972, excluded convicted first-degree murderers. However, in 1973, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that this right extended to first-degree murderers because the law specifically did not exclude them. The Massachusetts legislature quickly passed a bill prohibiting furloughs for such inmates. However, in 1976, Dukakis vetoed this bill, arguing it would &quot;cut the heart out of efforts at inmate rehabilitation.&quot;

The program remained in effect through the intervening term of Governor Edward J. King, and was abolished during Dukakis&#x27;s final term of office on April 28, 1988, after Dukakis had decided to run for president. This abolition occurred only after the &quot;Lawrence Eagle-Tribune&quot; had run 175 stories about the furlough program and won a Pulitzer Prize.

==Horton in the 1988 presidential campaign==

The first person to mention the Massachusetts furlough program in the 1988 presidential campaign was Democratic Senator Al Gore. During a debate before the New York primary, Gore took issue with the furlough program. However, he did not mention the Horton incident or even his name, instead asking a general question about the program.

Republicans eagerly picked up the Horton issue after Dukakis won the Democratic nomination. In June 1988, Republican candidate George H.W. Bush seized on the Horton case, bringing it up repeatedly in campaign speeches. Bush&#x27;s campaign manager Lee Atwater said: &quot;By the time we&#x27;re finished, they&#x27;re going to wonder whether Willie Horton is Dukakis&#x27;s running mate.&quot;

Campaign staffer James Pinkerton returned with reams of material that Atwater told him to reduce to a index card, telling him, &quot;I&#x27;m giving you one thing: You can use both sides of the 3×5 card.&quot; Pinkerton discovered the furlough issue by watching the Felt Forum debate. On May 25, 1988, Republican consultants met in Paramus, New Jersey, holding a focus group of &quot;Reagan Democrats&quot; who had voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984. These focus groups convinced Atwater and the other Republican consultants that they should &#x27;go negative&#x27; against Dukakis. Further information regarding the furlough came from aide Andrew Card, a Massachusetts native whom President George W. Bush later named as his Chief of Staff.

Over the Fourth of July weekend in 1988, Atwater attended a motorcyclists&#x27; convention in Luray, Virginia. Two couples talked about the Horton story featured in the July issue of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. Atwater joined them without mentioning who he was. Later that night, a focus group in Alabama had turned completely against Dukakis when presented with the information about Horton&#x27;s furlough. Atwater used this occurrence to argue the necessity of pounding Dukakis about the furlough issue.

===Fall campaign===
Beginning on September 21, 1988, the Americans for Bush arm of the National Security Political Action Committee (NSPAC), under the auspices of Floyd Brown, began running a campaign ad entitled &quot;Weekend Passes,&quot; using the Horton case to attack Dukakis. The ad was produced by media consultant Larry McCarthy, who had previously worked for Roger Ailes. After clearing the ad with television stations, McCarthy added a mug shot of Horton. The ad was run as an independent expenditure, separate from the Bush campaign, which claimed not to have had any role in its production. The ad referred to Horton as &quot;Willie&quot;, although he later said he had always gone by William:

The fact is, my name is not &#x27;Willie.&#x27; It&#x27;s part of the myth of the case. The name irks me. It was created to play on racial stereotypes: big, ugly, dumb, violent, black — &#x27;Willie.&#x27; I resent that. They created a fictional character — who seemed believable but did not exist. They stripped me of my identity, distorted the facts, and robbed me of my constitutional rights.

On October 5, 1988, a day after the &quot;Weekend Passes&quot; ad was taken off the airwaves and the day of the Bentsen–Quayle debate, the Bush campaign ran its ad, &quot;Revolving Door,&quot; which also attacked Dukakis over the weekend furlough program. While the advertisement did not mention Horton or feature his photograph, it depicted a variety of men walking in and out of prison through a revolving door.

The controversy escalated when vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen and former Democratic presidential candidate and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson called the &quot;Revolving Door&quot; ad racist, a charge which was denied by Bush and campaign staff.

Throughout most of the campaign, the Horton ad was seen as focusing on criminal justice issues, with neither the candidates nor journalists mentioning a racial component. However, near the end of the presidential campaign—on October 21, 1988—Democratic primary runner-up Jesse Jackson accused the ad&#x27;s creators of playing upon presumed fears of some voters, in particular those harboring stereotyped fears of blacks as criminals. From that point on, race was a substantial part of the media coverage of the ad itself and the campaign. Some candidates continued to deny it, and most commentators at the time felt it was not. Academics have noted that the alleged racial overtone of the ad was a key aspect of the way the ad was remembered and later studied.

On October 22, in an attempt to counter-attack, Dukakis&#x27;s campaign ran an ad about a convicted heroin dealer named Angel Medrano who raped and killed a pregnant mother of two after escaping from a federal correctional halfway house.

In 1990, the Ohio Democratic Party and a group called &quot;Black Elected Democrats of Ohio&quot; filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that NSPAC had coordinated or cooperated with the Bush campaign in airing the ad, which would make it an illegal in-kind campaign contribution. The investigation by the FEC, including deposition of officials from both organizations, revealed indirect connections between McCarthy and the Bush campaign (such as his having previously worked for Ailes) but found no direct evidence of wrongdoing. The investigation reached an impasse and was eventually closed with no finding of any violation of campaign finance laws.

Robin Toner of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1990 that Republicans and Democrats, while disagreeing on the merits of the ad itself, agreed it was &quot;devastating to Dukakis.&quot; Dukakis said in 2012 that while he initially tried to ignore the ad during the 1988 campaign, two months later he &quot;realized that I was getting killed with this stuff.&quot;

In December 2018, after Bush&#x27;s death, the ad was again highlighted by political commentators. Ann Coulter described his Willie Horton ad as &quot;the greatest campaign commercial in political history,&quot; claiming that it &quot;clearly and forcefully highlighted the two presidential candidates&#x27; diametrically opposed views&quot; on crime. Many other commentators have remarked that the Bush presidency, back to the campaign&#x27;s Horton advertisement, stoked racial animosity, and suggested the ad itself was race-baiting, as Horton&#x27;s race is still a key part of public awareness of the ad.

Later, Horton apologized to Dukakis for “the role I played in him losing the election.”

<text>The Rome and Vienna airport attacks were two major terrorist attacks carried out on 27 December 1985. Seven Arab terrorists attacked two airports in Rome, Italy, and Vienna, Austria, with assault rifles and hand grenades. Nineteen civilians were killed and over a hundred were injured before four of the terrorists were killed by El Al Security personnel and local police, who captured the remaining three.

==The attacks==
===Rome attack===
At 08:15 GMT, four Arab gunmen walked to the shared ticket counter for Israel&#x27;s El Al Airlines and Trans World Airlines at Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport outside Rome, Italy, fired assault rifles and threw grenades. They killed 16 and wounded 99, including American diplomat Wes Wessels, before three of the attackers were killed by El Al security, while the remaining one, Mohammed Sharam, was wounded and captured by the Italian police. The dead included General Donato Miranda Acosta, Mexican military attache, and his secretary, Genoveva Jaime Cisneros.

===Vienna attack===
Minutes later, at Schwechat Airport (Vienna International Airport) in Vienna, Austria, three terrorists carried out a similar attack. Hand grenades were thrown into crowds of passengers queuing to check in for a flight to Tel Aviv, killing two people instantly and wounding 39 others. A third victim died on 22 January 1986, of hand grenade wounds sustained in the attack. First response came from several Austrian police officers, who opened fire on the terrorists. They were supported by two plainclothes El Al security guards who helped to repel the attackers. Over 200 bullets were fired during the fight. The terrorists seized a Mercedes outside the terminal and fled, with Austrian police and El Al security guards giving chase. They killed one terrorist and captured the other two several miles from the airport after a short car chase and gun battle.

===Aftermath===
In all, the two strikes killed 19, including a child, and wounded around 140. Some contemporary reports claimed the gunmen originally intended to hijack El Al jets at the airports and blow them up over Tel Aviv; others concluded that the attack on waiting passengers was the original plan and that the Frankfurt airport was meant to be hit as well.

The attacks came after increased security due to recent hijackings and official Interpol warnings that airports might be targeted by terrorists during the holiday season.

==Perpetrators==
Italian authorities stated that receipts uncovered on the terrorists indicated that they had entered Italy a few weeks earlier and had stayed in hotels near Rome. They all had Moroccan passports. It was also reported that a note in Arabic was found on the body of one of the attackers, addressed to &quot;Zionists&quot; and announcing, &quot;the war has begun.&quot; The note was reportedly signed, &quot;the martyrs of Palestine.&quot;

Israeli authorities first blamed the attacks on the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), but its leader, Yasser Arafat, denied the accusations and denounced the strikes. The PLO expressed &#x27;indignation at the criminal act&quot; and asserted that the attacks were coordinated as part of a &quot;plot against the Palestinian cause&quot;, intending to force Austria and Italy into severing ties with the Palestinians. PLO officials recalled that Arafat had recently pledged that coordinated armed Palestinian resistance would be confined to Israel and the occupied territories.

Responsibility for the two attacks was later claimed by the Abu Nidal Organization (ANO) in retaliation for Operation Wooden Leg, the Israeli bombing of PLO headquarters in Tunis on 1 October 1985. Libya was accused by the US of funding the terrorists who carried out the attacks; although they denied the charges, they did praise the assaults. According to published reports, sources close to Abu Nidal said Libyan intelligence supplied the weapons and the ANO&#x27;s head of the Intelligence Directorate&#x27;s Committee for Special Missions, Dr. Ghassan al-Ali, organized the attacks. Libya denied these charges as well, notwithstanding that it claimed they were &quot;heroic operations carried out by the sons of the martyrs of Sabra and Shatila.&quot; Italian secret services blamed Syria and Iran.

The surviving terrorist in the Rome airport attack, Syrian national Mahmoud Ibrahim Khaled (Khalid Ibrahim), was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment in 1988. He was released early on good behavior in June 2010 and was living in Rome in 2011. He was employed, and had a girlfriend. In an interview with &quot;Il Messaggero&quot;, he condemned terrorism, expressed remorse for the attacks, and said that he prays for God&#x27;s forgiveness. In 1987, an Austrian court sentenced the two surviving terrorists in the Vienna airport attack to life imprisonment.

<text>Jacqueline Joyner-Kersee (born March 3, 1962) is an American former track and field athlete who competed in both the heptathlon and long jump. She won three gold, one silver, and two bronze Olympic medals at four different Olympic Games. Joyner-Kersee was also a four-time gold medalist (twice each in heptathlon and long jump) at the world championships. Since 1988, she has held the world record for heptathlon.

==Early life==
Jacqueline Joyner was born March 3, 1962, in East St. Louis, Illinois, and was named after Jacqueline Kennedy, the First Lady of the United States. As a high school athlete at East St. Louis Lincoln Senior High School, she qualified for the finals in the long jump at the 1980 Olympic Trials, finishing 8th behind another high schooler, Carol Lewis. She was inspired to compete in multi-disciplinary track &amp; field events after seeing a movie about Babe Didrikson Zaharias. Didrikson, the track star, basketball player, and pro golfer, was chosen the &quot;Greatest Female Athlete of the First Half of the 20th Century. Fifteen years later, &quot;Sports Illustrated for Women&quot; magazine voted Joyner-Kersee the greatest female athlete of all time, just ahead of Zaharias.

===UCLA===
Joyner attended college at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) from 1980 to 1985 where she starred in both track &amp; field and basketball.

In basketball, she was a starter at forward for each of her first three seasons (1980–81, 81–82, and 82–83) as well as in her senior (fifth) year, 1984–1985. She had red-shirted during the 1983–1984 academic year to concentrate on the heptathlon for the 1984 Summer Olympics. She scored 1,167 points during her collegiate career, which places her 19th all time for the Bruins games. The Bruins advanced to the West Regional semi-finals of the 1985 NCAA Division I Women&#x27;s Basketball Tournament before losing to eventual runner-up Georgia.

She was honored on February 21, 1998 as one of the 15 greatest players in UCLA women&#x27;s basketball. In April 2001, Joyner-Kersee was voted the &quot;Top Woman Collegiate Athlete of the Past 25 Years.&quot; The vote was conducted among the 976 NCAA member schools.

In track, Joyner won the Broderick Award (now the Honda Sports Award) as the nation&#x27;s best female collegiate track and field competitor in 1983 and in 1985, and was awarded the Honda-Broderick Cup, given to the nation&#x27;s best female collegiate athlete in 1985.

Joyner graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history in 1986.

==Competition==
===1984 Summer Olympics===
Joyner competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and won the silver medal in the heptathlon. She was the favorite heading into the event, but finished five points behind Australian athlete Glynis Nunn. She also placed fifth in the long jump.

===1986 Goodwill Games===
Joyner became the first woman to score over 7,000 points in a heptathlon event during the 1986 Goodwill Games. In 1986, she received the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States.

===1988 Summer Olympics===
Now known as Jackie Joyner-Kersee after marrying her coach Bob Kersee, she entered the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea and earned gold medals in both the heptathlon and the long jump. At the Games, she set the still-standing heptathlon world record of 7,291 points. Five days later, Joyner-Kersee won her second gold medal, leaping to an Olympic record of in the long jump. She was the first American woman to earn a gold medal in long jump as well as the first American woman to earn a gold medal in heptathlon.

At the 1988 Games she faced allegations of drug use from Brazilian runner Joaquim Cruz. This continued the following season in 1989 when Darrell Robinson accused Joyner-Kersee&#x27;s husband and coach, Bobby Kersee, of distributing performance-enhancing drugs. Years later, doping insider Victor Conte asserted that in 1988 he personally witnessed an Olympic official at the Seoul games notifying Bobby Kersee that Joyner-Kersee had tested positive for PED use. Joyner-Kersee has consistently maintained that she competed throughout her career without performance-enhancing drugs.

===1991 World Championships===

During the long jump event at the 1991 World Championships, having already won with a jump, Joyner-Kersee slipped on the take-off board and careened headfirst into the pit. She strained a hamstring and subsequently pulled out of the heptathlon during the 200 m at the end of the first day.

===1992 Summer Olympics===

In the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, Joyner-Kersee earned her second Olympic gold medal in the heptathlon. She also won the bronze medal in the long jump which was won by her friend Heike Drechsler of Germany.

===1996 Summer Olympics===

At the Olympic Trials, Joyner-Kersee sustained an injury to her right hamstring. When the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta began, Joyner-Kersee was not fully recovered by the time the heptathlon started. After running the first event, the 100 m hurdles, she withdrew due to pain. She was able to recover to compete in the long jump; her final jump of was vaulted into the bronze medal position. The TV never showed a replay of Joyner-Kersee&#x27;s final long jump attempt neither of the last step, raising serious doubts about its validity, particularly by runner-up Niki Xanthou.

===Professional basketball career===

In 1996 Joyner-Kersee signed to play pro basketball for the Richmond Rage of the fledgling American Basketball League. She appeared in 17 games, with a high of 15 points scored.

===1998 Goodwill Games===
Returning to track, Joyner-Kersee won the heptathlon at the 1998 Goodwill Games, scoring 6,502 points.

===2000 Olympic trials===

Two years after retiring, Joyner-Kersee tried to qualify for the long jump event at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. She placed sixth in the trials at 21–10 ¾, and did not make the Olympic team.

==Post-athletic career==
Joyner-Kersee is a philanthropist in children&#x27;s education, racial equality and women&#x27;s rights. She is a founder of the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Foundation, which encourages young people in East St. Louis to pursue athletics and academics. She collaborated with Comcast to create the Internet Essentials program in 2011, which provides high-speed internet access to low-income Americans.

In 2007, Joyner-Kersee was one of the co-founders of Athletes for Hope, a charitable organization that helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and inspires millions of non-athletes to volunteer and support the community.

She served on the board of directors for USA Track &amp; Field the national governing body of the sport.

<doc id="458673" wikidata="Q422080" url="?curid=458673" title="Chlorine dioxide">
<text>Chlorine dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula ClO2 that exists as yellowish-green gas above 11 °C, a reddish-brown liquid between 11 °C and −59 °C, and as bright orange crystals below −59 °C. It is usually handled as an aqueous solution. It is commonly used as a bleach. More recent developments have extended its applications in food processing and as a disinfectant.

== Structure and bonding ==
The molecule ClO2 has an odd number of valence electrons, and therefore, it is a paramagnetic radical. It is an unusual &quot;example of an odd-electron molecule stable toward dimerization&quot; (nitric oxide being another example).
ClO2 crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbca space group.

==History==
In 1933, Lawrence O. Brockway, a graduate student of Linus Pauling, proposed a structure that involved a three-electron bond and two single bonds. However, Pauling in his &quot;General Chemistry&quot; shows a double bond to one oxygen and a single bond plus a three-electron bond to the other. The valence bond structure would be represented as the resonance hybrid depicted by Pauling. The three-electron bond represents a bond that is &quot;weaker&quot; than the double bond. In molecular orbital theory this idea is commonplace if the third electron is placed in an anti-bonding orbital. Later work has confirmed that the highest occupied molecular orbital is indeed an incompletely-filled antibonding orbital.

== Preparation ==
Chlorine dioxide was first prepared in 1811 by Sir Humphry Davy.

The reaction of chlorine with oxygen under conditions of flash photolysis in the presence of ultraviolet light results in trace amounts of chlorine dioxide formation.
: Cl2 + 2 O2 &lt;chem&gt;-&gt;[\ce{UV}]&lt;/chem&gt; 2 ClO2 ↑

Chlorine dioxide can decompose violently when separated from diluting substances. As a result, preparation methods that involve producing solutions of it without going through a gas-phase stage are often preferred.
=== Oxidation of chlorite ===
In the laboratory, ClO2 can be prepared by oxidation of sodium chlorite with chlorine:
Traditionally, chlorine dioxide for disinfection applications has been made from sodium chlorite or the sodium chlorite–hypochlorite method:

or the sodium chlorite–hydrochloric acid method:

or the chlorite–sulfuric acid method:
All three methods can produce chlorine dioxide with high chlorite conversion yield. Unlike the other processes, the chlorite–sulfuric acid method is completely chlorine-free, although it suffers from the requirement of 25% more chlorite to produce an equivalent amount of chlorine dioxide. Alternatively, hydrogen peroxide may be efficiently used in small-scale applications.

Addition of sulfuric acid or any strong acid to chlorate salts produces chlorine dioxide.
=== Reduction of chlorate ===
In the laboratory, chlorine dioxide can also be prepared by reaction of potassium chlorate with oxalic acid:
or with oxalic and sulfuric acid:
Over 95% of the chlorine dioxide produced in the world today is made by reduction of sodium chlorate, for use in pulp bleaching. It is produced with high efficiency in a strong acid solution with a suitable reducing agent such as methanol, hydrogen peroxide, hydrochloric acid or sulfur dioxide. Modern technologies are based on methanol or hydrogen peroxide, as these chemistries allow the best economy and do not co-produce elemental chlorine. The overall reaction can be written as:

As a typical example, the reaction of sodium chlorate with hydrochloric acid in a single reactor is believed to proceed through the following pathway:


which gives the overall reaction 
The commercially more important production route uses methanol as the reducing agent and sulfuric acid for the acidity. Two advantages of not using the chloride-based processes are that there is no formation of elemental chlorine, and that sodium sulfate, a valuable chemical for the pulp mill, is a side-product. These methanol-based processes provide high efficiency and can be made very safe.

The variant process using sodium chlorate, hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid has been increasingly used since 1999 for water treatment and other small-scale disinfection applications, since it produce a chlorine-free product at high efficiency, over 95%.

=== Other processes ===
Very pure chlorine dioxide can also be produced by electrolysis of a chlorite solution:

High-purity chlorine dioxide gas (7.7% in air or nitrogen) can be produced by the gas–solid method, which reacts dilute chlorine gas with solid sodium chlorite:

== Handling properties ==
Chlorine dioxide is very different from elemental chlorine. One of the most important qualities of chlorine dioxide is its high water solubility, especially in cold water. Chlorine dioxide does not react with water; it remains a dissolved gas in solution. Chlorine dioxide is approximately 10 times more soluble in water than elemental chlorine but its solubility is very temperature-dependent.

At partial pressures above (or gas-phase concentrations greater than 10% volume in air at STP) of ClO2 may explosively decompose into chlorine and oxygen. The decomposition can be initiated by light, hot spots, chemical reaction, or pressure shock. Thus, chlorine dioxide is never handled as a pure gas, but is almost always handled in an aqueous solution in concentrations between 0.5 to 10 grams per liter. Its solubility increases at lower temperatures, so it is common to use chilled water (5 °C, 41 °F) when storing at concentrations above 3 grams per liter. In many countries, such as the United States, chlorine dioxide may not be transported at any concentration and is instead almost always produced on-site. In some countries, chlorine dioxide solutions below 3 grams per liter in concentration may be transported by land, but they are relatively unstable and deteriorate quickly.

==Uses==
Chlorine dioxide is used for bleaching of wood pulp and for the disinfection (called chlorination) of municipal drinking water, treatment of water in oil and gas applications, disinfection in the food industry, microbiological control in cooling towers, and textile bleaching. As a disinfectant, it is effective even at low concentrations because of its unique qualities.

=== Bleaching ===
Chlorine dioxide is sometimes used for bleaching of wood pulp in combination with chlorine, but it is used alone in ECF (elemental chlorine-free) bleaching sequences. It is used at moderately acidic pH (3.5 to 6). The use of chlorine dioxide minimizes the amount of organochlorine compounds produced. Chlorine dioxide (ECF technology) currently is the most important bleaching method worldwide. About 95% of all bleached kraft pulp is made using chlorine dioxide in ECF bleaching sequences.

Chlorine dioxide has been used to bleach flour.

=== Water treatment ===

The water treatment plant at Niagara Falls, New York first used chlorine dioxide for drinking water treatment in 1944 for destroying &quot;taste and odor producing phenolic compounds.&quot; Chlorine dioxide was introduced as a drinking water disinfectant on a large scale in 1956, when Brussels, Belgium, changed from chlorine to chlorine dioxide. Its most common use in water treatment is as a pre-oxidant prior to chlorination of drinking water to destroy natural water impurities that would otherwise produce trihalomethanes upon exposure to free chlorine. Trihalomethanes are suspected carcinogenic disinfection by-products associated with chlorination of naturally occurring organics in raw water. Chlorine dioxide also produces 70% fewer halomethanes in the presence of natural organic matter compared to when elemental chlorine or bleach is used.

Chlorine dioxide is also superior to chlorine when operating above pH 7, in the presence of ammonia and amines, and for the control of biofilms in water distribution systems. Chlorine dioxide is used in many industrial water treatment applications as a biocide, including cooling towers, process water, and food processing.

Chlorine dioxide is less corrosive than chlorine and superior for the control of &quot;Legionella&quot; bacteria.
Chlorine dioxide is superior to some other secondary water disinfection methods, in that chlorine dioxide is not negatively impacted by pH, does not lose efficacy over time, because the bacteria will not grow resistant to it, and is not negatively impacted by silica and phosphates, which are commonly used potable water corrosion inhibitors. In the United States, it is an EPA-registered biocide.

It is more effective as a disinfectant than chlorine in most circumstances against waterborne pathogenic agents such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoa – including the cysts of &quot;Giardia&quot; and the oocysts of &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;.

The use of chlorine dioxide in water treatment leads to the formation of the by-product chlorite, which is currently limited to a maximum of 1 part per million in drinking water in the USA. This EPA standard limits the use of chlorine dioxide in the US to relatively high-quality water, because this minimizes chlorite concentration, or water that is to be treated with iron-based coagulants, because iron can reduce chlorite to chloride. The World Health Organization also advises a 1ppm dosification.

=== Use in public crises ===
Chlorine dioxide has many applications as an oxidizer or disinfectant. Chlorine dioxide can be used for air disinfection and was the principal agent used in the decontamination of buildings in the United States after the 2001 anthrax attacks. After the disaster of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana, and the surrounding Gulf Coast, chlorine dioxide was used to eradicate dangerous mold from houses inundated by the flood water.

In addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has posted a list of many disinfectants that meet its criteria for use in environmental measures against the causative coronavirus. Some are based on sodium chlorite that is activated into chlorine dioxide, though differing formulations are used in each product. Many other products on the EPA list contain sodium hypochlorite, which is similar in name but should not be confused with sodium chlorite because they have very different modes of chemical action.

=== Other disinfection uses ===
Chlorine dioxide may be used as a fumigant treatment to &quot;sanitize&quot; fruits such as blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries that develop molds and yeast.

Chlorine dioxide may be used to disinfect poultry by spraying or immersing it after slaughtering.

Chlorine dioxide may be used for the disinfection of endoscopes, such as under the trade name Tristel. It is also available in a trio consisting of a preceding pre-clean with surfactant and a succeeding rinse with deionized water and a low-level antioxidant.

Chlorine dioxide may be used for control of zebra and quagga mussels in water intakes.

Chlorine dioxide was shown to be effective in bedbug eradication.

For water purification during camping, disinfecting tablets containing chlorine dioxide are more effective against pathogens than those using household bleach, but typically cost more.

=== Other uses ===
Chlorine dioxide is used as an oxidant for destroying phenols in wastewater streams and for odor control in the air scrubbers of animal byproduct (rendering) plants. It is also available for use as a deodorant for cars and boats, in chlorine dioxide-generating packages that are activated by water and left in the boat or car overnight.

In dilute concentrations, chlorine dioxide is an ingredient that acts as an antiseptic agent in some mouthwashes.

== Safety issues in water and supplements ==
Potential hazards with chlorine dioxide include poisoning and the risk of spontaneous ignition or explosion on contact with flammable materials.

Chlorine dioxide is toxic, and limits on human exposure are required to ensure its safe use. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has set a maximum level of 0.8 mg/L for chlorine dioxide in drinking water. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), an agency of the United States Department of Labor, has set an 8-hour permissible exposure limit of 0.1 ppm in air (0.3 mg/m3) for people working with chlorine dioxide.

Chlorine dioxide has been fraudulently and illegally marketed as an ingestible cure for a wide range of diseases, including childhood autism and coronavirus. Children who have been given enemas of chlorine dioxide as a supposed cure for childhood autism have suffered life-threatening ailments. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated that ingestion or other internal use of chlorine dioxide, outside of supervised oral rinsing using dilute concentrations, has no health benefits of any kind, and it should not be used internally for any reason.

=== Pseudomedicine ===
On 30 July and 1 October 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration warned against the use of the product &quot;Miracle Mineral Supplement&quot;, or &quot;MMS&quot;, which when prepared according to the instructions produces chlorine dioxide. MMS has been marketed as a treatment for a variety of conditions, including HIV, cancer, autism, acne, and, more recently, COVID-19. Many have complained to the FDA, reporting life-threatening reactions, and even death. The FDA has warned consumers that MMS can cause serious harm to health, and stated that it has received numerous reports of nausea, diarrhea, severe vomiting, and life-threatening low blood pressure caused by dehydration. This warning was repeated for a third time on 12 August 2019, and a fourth on 8 April 2020, stating that ingesting MMS is just as hazardous as ingesting bleach, and urging consumers not to use them or give these products to their children for any reason, as there is no scientific evidence showing that chlorine dioxide has any beneficial medical properties.

<doc id="458675" wikidata="Q714750" url="?curid=458675" title="Brinell hardness test">
<text>The Brinell hardness test (pronounced ) measures the indentation hardness of materials. It determines hardness through the scale of penetration of an indenter, loaded on a material test-piece. It is one of several definitions of hardness in materials science. The hardness scale is expressed as the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN or BH) and was named for Johan August Brinell, who developed the method in the early 20th century.

==History==
Proposed by Swedish engineer Johan August Brinell in 1900, it was the first widely used and standardised hardness test in engineering and metallurgy. The large size of indentation and possible damage to test-piece limits its usefulness. However, it also had the useful feature that the hardness value divided by two gave the approximate UTS in ksi for steels. This feature contributed to its early adoption over competing hardness tests.

==Test details==
The typical test uses a diameter steel ball as an indenter with a force. For softer materials, a smaller force is used; for harder materials, a tungsten carbide ball is substituted for the steel ball. The indentation is measured and hardness calculated as:

:formula_1

where:
:BHN = Brinell Hardness Number (kgf/mm)
:&quot;P&quot; = applied load in kilogram-force (kgf)
:&quot;D&quot; = diameter of indenter (mm)
:&quot;d&quot; = diameter of indentation (mm)

Brinell hardness is sometimes quoted in megapascals; the Brinell hardness number is multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity, 9.80665 m/s2, to convert it to megapascals.

The Brinell hardness number can be correlated with the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), although the relationship is dependent on the material, and therefore determined empirically. The relationship is based on Meyer&#x27;s index (n) from Meyer&#x27;s law. If Meyer&#x27;s index is less than 2.2 then the ratio of UTS to BHN is 0.36. If Meyer&#x27;s index is greater than 2.2, then the ratio increases.

The Brinell hardness is designated by the most commonly used test standards (ASTM E10-14 and ISO 6506–1:2005) as &quot;HBW&quot; (&quot;H&quot; from hardness, &quot;B&quot; from brinell and &quot;W&quot; from the material of the indenter, tungsten (wolfram) carbide). In former standards HB or HBS were used to refer to measurements made with steel indenters.

HBW is calculated in both standards using the SI units as

:formula_2

where:
:&quot;F&quot; = applied load (newtons)
:&quot;D&quot; = diameter of indenter (mm)
:&quot;d&quot; = diameter of indentation (mm)

== Common values ==
When quoting a Brinell hardness number (BHN or more commonly HB), the conditions of the test used to obtain the number must be specified. The standard format for specifying tests can be seen in the example &quot;HBW 10/3000&quot;. &quot;HBW&quot; means that a tungsten carbide (from the chemical symbol for tungsten or from the Spanish/Swedish/German name for tungsten, &quot;Wolfram&quot;) ball indenter was used, as opposed to &quot;HBS&quot;, which means a hardened steel ball. The &quot;10&quot; is the ball diameter in millimeters. The &quot;3000&quot; is the force in kilograms force.

The hardness may also be shown as XXX HB YY&quot;D&quot;2. The XXX is the force to apply (in kgf) on a material of type YY (5 for aluminum alloys, 10 for copper alloys, 30 for steels). Thus a typical steel hardness could be written: 250 HB 30&quot;D&quot;2. It could be a maximum or a minimum.

<text>Nerja () is a municipality on the Costa del Sol in the province of Málaga in the autonomous community of Andalusia in southern Spain. It is part of the comarca of La Axarquía. It is on the country&#x27;s southern Mediterranean coast, about east of Málaga.

Under Islamic rule, its name was &quot;Narixa&quot;, which means &quot;abundant source&quot;, and is the origin of the current name.

==History==
Nerja has a long history, evidenced by the primitive paintings found in its famous Nerja caves, discovered in pedro sanchez 1959. These caves are now believed to be just one entrance to a linked series of sinkholes stretching many miles into the mountains between Nerja and Granada, and which may yet prove to be one of the most extensive unexplored systems in Europe. Visitors to the caves will be able to view the remains of one of the ancient inhabitants of Nerja.

The Romans built three settlements here, including &quot;Detunda&quot;, of which now large remains can be seen. The area was later taken over by the Arabs in the early 8th century. Under the Moors, the town was known as &quot;Narixa&quot;, which means &quot;abundant spring&quot;, from which the present name derives.
Its agricultural and silk products are said to have been famed throughout the Muslim world and in the markets of Damascus as early as the 10th century.

The &quot;Balcón de Europa&quot;, a &quot;mirador&quot; or viewpoint which gives views across the sea, is in the centre of the old town. Its name is popularly believed to have been coined by King Alfonso XII, who visited the area in 1885 following a disastrous earthquake and was captivated by the scene. Local folklore says that he stood upon the site where the Balcón now stands, and said &quot;This is the balcony of Europe&quot;. Local archive documents are said to show that its name predated this visit, but this has not prevented the authorities from placing a life-sized (and much photographed) statue of the king standing by the railing.

The Balcón area was originally known as La Batería, a reference to the gun battery which existed there in a fortified tower. This emplacement and a similar tower nearby were destroyed during the Peninsular War. In May 1812, the British vessels &quot;Hyacinth&quot;, &quot;Termagant&quot; and &quot;Basilisk&quot; supported Spanish guerrillas on the coast of Granada, against the French. On 20 May, &quot;Termagant&quot; or &quot;Hyacinth&quot; opened fire and the forts were destroyed. Two rusty guns positioned at the end of the Balcón are reminders of these violent times. The huge lumps of rock, the remains of La Batería, visible in the sea at the end of the Balcón, are further evidence of this action.

* Burriana
* Carabeillo
* Carabeo
*Chucho
*Torrecilla
*El Salón
*Playazo
*Calahonda
*Caletilla

== Sports ==
Enrique López Cuenca Sports Stadium is a combined Rugby and Athletics stadium, home to the local rugby (union) side Club Nerja Rugby. Local semi-professional soccer team C.D Nerja (Club Deportivo Nerja) used to play at the stadium, but now have a purpose built ground behind the Medico.

Sea-kayaking and scuba-diving are based at Burriana beach.

Padel and tennis are based at Club de Tenis y Padel la Raqueta, a short walk from the centre of town.

== Public transport ==

The closest airport to Nerja is Malaga-Costa del Sol Airport (AGP), which is 45 minute drive via A-7. 

Nerja is not integrated in the Málaga Metropolitan Transport Consortium.

As well as two local bus routes, around town (from the Riú Mónica Hotel), there are buses from the top of the High Street by the Alsa ticket office to Málaga, Caves of Nerja, Frigiliana, Maro, Almuñécar, Vélez-Málaga, Torre del Mar, Granada, Córdoba, Seville, Almería and Motril.

==Twin towns==

* Pescia, Italy
* San Juan, Argentina
* Torremolinos, Spain

==In popular culture==

Nerja has been a source of inspiration for expatriate writers and artists, such as Scottish novelist Joan Lingard and French-born author André Launay; Jorge Guillén and Federico García Lorca were long-time visitors and residents of the town.
The town was also the main setting for the filming of &quot;Verano azul&quot; (translated as &quot;Blue Summer&quot;), a popular Spanish television series later exported to several countries. A replica of the boat featured in the series can be found in a park of the same name as the series, near the centre of town.

In popular fiction, &quot;The Enigmatic Mr Phelps&quot; (pub.1997-2003-2005), which combines the first two international crime fiction novels in a continuing series, along with a screenplay, &quot;Mr Phelps&quot;, in 2016, are set in Nerja during the mid 1990s. Co-written by award-winning Canadian film director and screenwriter Jason C. Bourque, it was created for a film adaptation by Canada-based English international crime writer David B. Green. The stories include many references to Nerja and the Axarquia region, focusing on a fictional bar/restaurant located on c/Carabeo. The fictional character of Phelps is often confused with the real life of the author, who himself lived in Nerja between 1995 and 1998.

In October 2005, two episodes of the British television soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot; were set in Spain, featuring the characters of Eric Pollard, Carl King, and the Dingle family. Filming took place in Nerja. Broadcast in November that year, the second episode was an hour-long special, and acknowledged the town on the end credits.

== Media ==
The town has a commercial Spanish-language pop radio station, Radio Nerja.

== Climate ==
Nerja, has a Mediterranean climate with mild winters (8°C–17°C) and hot, dry summers (20°C–30°C). Winters are wetter, while summers are sunny with little rain. Average sunshine is 5–11 hours per day, depending on the season.

<text>The Myctophiformes are an order of ray-finned fishes consisting of two families of deep-sea marine fish, most notably the highly abundant lanternfishes (Myctophidae). The blackchins (Neoscopelidae) contain six species in three genera, while the bulk of the family belongs to the Myctophidae, with over 30 genera and some 252 species.

The scientific name ultimately derives from Ancient Greek &quot;myktér&quot; (μυκτήρ, &quot;nose&quot;) + &quot;óphis&quot; (ὄφῖς, &quot;serpent&quot;) + Latin &quot;forma&quot; (&quot;external form&quot;), the Greek part in reference to the long, slender, and heavy-headed shape of these fishes.

==Description and ecology==
These smallish fishes inhabit the pelagic and benthopelagic zones of the deep sea. They are laterally compressed and usually have photophores (light organs). The eyes are large, in some decidedly huge, and generally directed straight sideways. The mouth also quite large and located at the tip of the snout; its gape extends to below the eyes or even beyond. They have an adipose fin. The pelvic fin has eight rays in most myctophiforms, and the number of branchiostegal rays is usually higher than six and lower than 12.

==Systematics==
The two families of the Myctophiformes are:
* Myctophidae – lanternfishes
* Neoscopelidae – blackchins
The extinct family Sardinioididae (containing &quot;Sardinioides&quot; and possibly &quot;Volcichthys&quot;) is known from the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian to Campanian). The genus &quot;Neocassandra&quot; from the Late Paleocene is either considered its own family or a member of the Neoscopelidae. Some members were previously confused with aulopiforms.

The order Myctophiformes is anatomically similar to the grinners (Aulopiformes), but their pharyngobranchials and retractor muscles are more plesiomorphic. It was also allied with the more advanced spiny-rayed Teleostei (e.g. Paracanthopterygii) as &quot;Ctenosquamata&quot;. These apomorphically have a fifth upper pharyngeal toothplate and a third internal levator muscle to move it, and molecular data also support the long-held view that these two lineages are at least closely related. Other sources ally them with the Lampriformes, which are often placed in a monotypic superorder &quot;Lampridiomorpha&quot;. In a similar fashion, separation of the Myctophiformes in superorder &quot;Scopelomorpha&quot; has been proposed. The Aulopiformes, though, are usually considered to be closer or even among the Protacanthopterygii, one of the core groups of moderately advanced teleosts. As modern taxonomy tries to avoid a profusion of small taxa, and the delimitation of the Euteleostei (Protacanthopterygii &quot;sensu stricto&quot; and their allies) versus &quot;Ctenosquamata&quot; such as the Paracanthopterygii remains uncertain, the systematics and taxonomy of the Myctophiformes among the teleosts are in need of further study.

<text>Allan R. Bomhard (born July 10 1943) is an Americanindependent scholar writing books and predominantly self-published papers in the field of comparative linguistics and Buddhism. He is part of a small group of proponents of the Nostratic hypothesis, according to which the Indo-European languages, Uralic languages, Afroasiatic languages, and the Altaic languages would all belong to a larger macrofamily. As a prominent proponent of Nostratic, Bomhards work has received attention from mainstream linguists and occasionally been discussed in linguistic sources. The majority of his work has been self published or printed thorough vanity presses. Mainstream linguists have dismissed his theories.

== Criticism ==
His theory about Nostratic languages is widely rejected by mainstream linguists as a fringe theory. Among Nostratists, he has been described as &quot;a maximalist who casts his nets as widely as possible&quot; among far-flung languages not generally believed to be related.

Russian linguists Georgiy Starostin, Mikhail Zhivlov, and Alexei Kassian have criticized his work as imprecise and &quot;historically unrealistic&quot;.

<text>Emma Dorothy Eliza Nevitte Southworth (December 26, 1819June 30, 1899) was an American writer of more than 60 novels in the latter part of the 19th century. She was the most popular American novelist of her day.

In her novels, her heroines often challenge modern perceptions of Victorian feminine domesticity by showing virtue as naturally allied to wit, adventure, and rebellion to remedy any unfortunate situation. Though &quot;The Hidden Hand&quot; (1859) was her most popular novel, Southworth&#x27;s favorite of her works was her novel &quot;Ishmael&quot; (1876).

==Early life and education==

E. D. E. N. Southworth was born Emma Nevitte on December 26, 1819, in Washington, D.C., to Susannah Wailes and Charles LeCompte Nevitte, a Virginia merchant. Her father died in 1824, and per his deathbed request she was christened Emma Dorothy Eliza Nevitte. She studied in a school kept by her stepfather, Joshua L. Henshaw. She later recalled her childhood as a lonely one, with her happiest moments spent exploring Maryland&#x27;s Tidewater region on horseback. During those rides, she acquired an abiding interest in the area&#x27;s history and folklore. After attending her stepfather&#x27;s school, she completed her secondary education in 1835 at the age of 15.

==Career==
She then accepted a position as a schoolteacher. 

In 1840, she married inventor Frederick H. Southworth, of Utica, New York. Southworth moved with her husband to Wisconsin to become a teacher. After 1843, she returned to Washington, D.C. without her husband and with two young children.

After the birth of their second child, Frederick abandoned his family in search of Brazilian gold. Southworth never divorced her husband on conscientious grounds.

She began to write stories to support herself and her children when her husband deserted her in 1844. Her first story, &quot;The Irish Refugee&quot;, was published in the &quot;Baltimore Saturday Visiter&quot;.
Some of her earliest works appeared in &quot;The National Era&quot;, the newspaper that printed &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. The bulk of her work appeared as a serial in Robert E. Bonner&#x27;s &quot;New York Ledger&quot;, and in 1857 Southworth signed a contract to write exclusively for this publication.

The exclusive contract Southworth signed with Bonner in 1856 and royalties from her published novels earned her about $10,000 a year, making her one of the country&#x27;s best-paid writers. Southworth and her children were in ill health through much of the 1850s, but Bonner&#x27;s contract guaranteed her income regardless of any periods of inactivity brought on by poor health. This arrangement remained intact for 30 years.

Like her friend Harriet Beecher Stowe, she was a supporter of social change and women&#x27;s rights, but she was not nearly as active on these issues. Her first novel, &quot;Retribution&quot;, a serial for the &quot;National Era&quot;, published in book form in 1849, was so well received that she gave up teaching and became a regular contributor to various periodicals, especially the &quot;New York Ledger&quot;. She lived in Georgetown, D.C., until 1876, then in Yonkers, New York, and again in Georgetown, where she died on June 8, 1899. Georgetown University Library has an exhibition on her home and work.

Her best known work was &quot;The Hidden Hand&quot;. It first appeared in serial form in the &quot;New York Ledger&quot; in 1859, and was serialized twice more (1868–69, 1883) before first appearing in book form in 1888. Bonner used the appeal of the novel to &quot;give an occasional boost to his weekly&#x27;s already massive circulation.&quot; It features Capitola Black, a tomboyish protagonist that finds herself in a myriad of adventures. Southworth stated that nearly every adventure of her heroine came from real life. Most of Southworth&#x27;s novels deal with the Southern United States during the post-American Civil War era. She wrote over sixty; some of them were translated into German, French, Chinese, Icelandic and Spanish; in 1872 an edition of thirty-five volumes was published in Philadelphia.

Bonner was asked by a reporter in 1889 &quot;Who were your most successful story writers?&quot; His reply was: &quot;Mrs. Southworth and Sylvanus Cobb Jr. I think that the most popular and successful stories ever printed as serials were Cobb&#x27;s &#x27;The Gunmaker of Moscow&#x27; and Mrs. Southworth&#x27;s &#x27;Hidden Hand.&#x27; &quot;

Her novel &quot;Tried for Her Life&quot; was referenced in chapter 8 of Jack Finney&#x27;s novel &quot;Time and Again.&quot;

She was a member of the Woman&#x27;s National Press Association.

==Death==
Southworth is buried in Washington&#x27;s Oak Hill Cemetery.

<doc id="458693" wikidata="Q899594" url="?curid=458693" title="Liebig condenser">
<text>The Liebig condenser (, ) or straight condenser is a piece of laboratory equipment, specifically a condenser consisting of a straight glass tube surrounded by a water jacket.

In typical laboratory operation, such as distillation, the condenser is clamped to a retort stand in vertical or oblique orientation. The hot vapor of some liquid is introduced at the upper end of the inner tube, and condenses in contact with its colder walls. Water (or some other fluid) is constantly circulated in the jacket to carry away the heat of vaporization released by the condensing vapor, keeping the tube below the liquid&#x27;s boiling point. The condensed liquid drips out of the lower end of the inner tube.

The Liebig condenser can also be used in reflux or Soxhlet extraction operations, although other condenser types are better suited to those tasks. In this usage, the condenser is held vertically above the recipient with the boiling liquid. The vapor is admitted to the inner tube through the lower end, and the condensed liquid drips back through the same opening, while the upper end of the tube is usually left open to the atmosphere.

==History==
This type of condenser is named after the German chemist Justus von Liebig, even though he only perfected and popularized it.

The earliest water-cooled laboratory condenser was invented in 1771 by the Swedish-German chemist Christian Weigel (1748–1831). Weigel&#x27;s condenser consisted of two coaxial tin tubes, which were joined at their lower ends, forming a water jacket, and open at their upper ends. Cold water entered the jacket via an inlet at the bottom and spilled out of the jacket&#x27;s open upper end. A glass tube carrying vapors from a distillation flask passed through the inner tin tube. Weigel subsequently replaced the inner tin tube with a glass tube, and he devised a clamp to hold the condenser.

However, an anonymous pamphlet published in 1781 claimed that a countercurrent condenser had been conceived in 1770 and tested in 1773. Illustrations in the pamphlet show a retort to which a tube was fitted. The tube carried the retort&#x27;s vapors through a rectangular box, which acted as a condenser and in which cold water flowed from the condenser&#x27;s lower end to its upper end—a counter-current condenser.

In 1794, the German pharmacist Johann Friedrich August Göttling (1753–1809), who was a former student of Weigel, improved the design by sealing both ends of the water jacket.

In 1778, in what seems to be an independent invention, Finnish pharmacist Jakob Gadolin (1719–1802) proposed condensers for use in distilleries and in laboratories, consisted of a metal jacket which surrounded the discharge tube from a distillation vessel and through which a countercurrent of cold water flowed.

Also independently of Weigel, Pierre-Isaac Poissonnier (1720–1798), a physician to the king Louis XV of France, published in 1779 a design of a still for producing freshwater from seawater aboard a ship. The apparatus consisted of a retort for boiling the seawater, a tube extending from the retort through a rectangular box filled with flowing cold water, fed by a separate tank.

Liebig himself incorrectly attributed the design to Göttling. Liebig replaced the outer metal wall of Weigel&#x27;s condenser by a glass tube, and used rubber hoses, instead of metal tubes, to convey water to and from the condenser.

==Design==

The modern design consists of two concentric straight glass tubes, the inner one being longer and protruding at both extremities. The ends of the outer tube are sealed (usually by a blown glass ring seal), forming a water jacket, and is fitted with side ports near the ends for cooling fluid inflow and outflow. The ends of the inner tube, that carries the vapor and condensed liquid, are open; they are often fitted with ground glass joints for secure and airtight connection to other equipment.

==Efficiency==
Compared to the simple air-cooled tube condenser of a retort or the head of an alembic, the Liebig condenser is more efficient at removing the heat of condensation and at maintaining a stable low temperature on the condensation surface.

<text>Camberwell College of Arts is a constituent college of the University of the Arts London, a public art and design university in London, England. The college offers further and higher education programmes, including postgraduate and PhD awards. The college has retained single degree options within Fine Art, offering specialist Bachelor of Arts courses in painting, sculpture, photography and drawing. It also runs graduate and postgraduate courses in fine art as well as design courses such as graphic design, illustration and 3D design. It has been ranked as the top British art school by The Times.

It was established as the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts in 1898, and adopted its present name in 1989.

==History==
The history of the College is closely linked with that of the South London Gallery, with which the College shares its site. The manager of the South London Working Men&#x27;s College in 1868, William Rossiter, purchased the freehold of Portland House on which the College now stands in 1889. The resulting Gallery opened in 1891, followed by the Technical Institute in 1898.

The architect was Maurice Bingham Adams. Originally, the school offered classes in specific trades. By 1920, a Fine Art Department had been created.

During the Second World War, Victor Pasmore was appointed head of the painting department. Many well-known artists, including Frank Auerbach, Lawrence Gowing and Edward Ardizzone taught at Camberwell during this period. In 1973, the School expanded into a modern purpose-built block next to the existing premises. Both of them are now Listed Buildings.

In the 1980s, Wendy Smith became the head of Fine Art and employed Noel Forster, John Hilliard, Cornelia Parker, Phyllida Barlow, Gavin Jantjes and Ian McKeever. Tony Messenger and Eileen Hogan took charge of the graphics department, Eileen Hogan established and ran The Camberwell Press, and Eric Ayers presided over the typography school.

Camberwell temporarily lost its Fine Art courses but by 2004 the department had been fully restored to the College.

==Affiliations==
Camberwell and its sister colleges Chelsea College of Arts and Wimbledon College of Arts makes up CCW, a three-college model that allows sharing of resources between colleges. CCW combined their foundation courses from the academic year starting in September 2011, and bases them at the Wilson Road campus in Camberwell.

==Peckham Platform==
Peckham Platform is a public gallery dedicated to location-specific artwork made locally. Originally known as Peckham Space and part of Camberwell, in 2013 it became an independent charity.

<doc id="458698" wikidata="Q3277121" url="?curid=458698" title="Weak operator topology">
<text>In functional analysis, the weak operator topology, often abbreviated WOT, is the weakest topology on the set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space formula_1, such that the functional sending an operator formula_2 to the complex number formula_3 is continuous for any vectors formula_4 and formula_5 in the Hilbert space.

Explicitly, for an operator formula_2 there is base of neighborhoods of the following type: choose a finite number of vectors formula_7, continuous functionals formula_8, and positive real constants formula_9 indexed by the same finite set formula_10. An operator formula_11 lies in the neighborhood if and only if formula_12 for all formula_13.

Equivalently, a net formula_14 of bounded operators converges to formula_15 in WOT if for all formula_16 and formula_17, the net formula_18 converges to formula_19.

==Relationship with other topologies on &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;)==

The WOT is the weakest among all common topologies on formula_20, the bounded operators on a Hilbert space formula_1.

===Strong operator topology===

The strong operator topology, or SOT, on formula_20 is the topology of pointwise convergence. Because the inner product is a continuous function, the SOT is stronger than WOT. The following example shows that this inclusion is strict. Let formula_23 and consider the sequence formula_24 of right shifts. An application of Cauchy-Schwarz shows that formula_25 in WOT. But clearly formula_26 does not converge to formula_27 in SOT.

The linear functionals on the set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that are continuous in the strong operator topology are precisely those that are continuous in the WOT (actually, the WOT is the weakest operator topology that leaves continuous all strongly continuous linear functionals on the set formula_20 of bounded operators on the Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;). Because of this fact, the closure of a convex set of operators in the WOT is the same as the closure of that set in the SOT.

It follows from the polarization identity that a net formula_29 converges to formula_27 in SOT if and only if formula_31 in WOT.

===Weak-star operator topology===

The predual of &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) is the trace class operators C1(&quot;H&quot;), and it generates the w*-topology on &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;), called the weak-star operator topology or σ-weak topology. The weak-operator and σ-weak topologies agree on norm-bounded sets in &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;).

A net {&quot;Tα&quot;} ⊂ &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) converges to &quot;T&quot; in WOT if and only Tr(&quot;TαF&quot;) converges to Tr(&quot;TF&quot;) for all finite-rank operator &quot;F&quot;. Since every finite-rank operator is trace-class, this implies that WOT is weaker than the σ-weak topology. To see why the claim is true, recall that every finite-rank operator &quot;F&quot; is a finite sum

:formula_32

So {&quot;Tα&quot;} converges to &quot;T&quot; in WOT means

:formula_33

Extending slightly, one can say that the weak-operator and σ-weak topologies agree on norm-bounded sets in &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;): Every trace-class operator is of the form

:formula_34

where the series formula_35 converges. Suppose formula_36 and formula_37 in WOT. For every trace-class &quot;S&quot;,

:formula_38

by invoking, for instance, the dominated convergence theorem.

Therefore every norm-bounded closed set is compact in WOT, by the Banach–Alaoglu theorem.

==Other properties==

The adjoint operation &quot;T&quot; → &quot;T*&quot;, as an immediate consequence of its definition, is continuous in WOT.

Multiplication is not jointly continuous in WOT: again let formula_2 be the unilateral shift. Appealing to Cauchy-Schwarz, one has that both &quot;Tn&quot; and &quot;T*n&quot; converges to 0 in WOT. But &quot;T*nTn&quot; is the identity operator for all formula_40. (Because WOT coincides with the σ-weak topology on bounded sets, multiplication is not jointly continuous in the σ-weak topology.)

However, a weaker claim can be made: multiplication is separately continuous in WOT. If a net &quot;Ti&quot; → &quot;T&quot; in WOT, then &quot;STi&quot; → &quot;ST&quot; and &quot;TiS&quot; → &quot;TS&quot; in WOT.

==SOT and WOT on &quot;B(X,Y)&quot; when &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are normed spaces==

We can extend the definitions of SOT and WOT to the more general setting where &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are normed spaces and formula_41 is the space of bounded linear operators of the form formula_42. In this case, each pair formula_43 and formula_44 defines a seminorm formula_45 on formula_41 via the rule formula_47. The resulting family of seminorms generates the weak operator topology on formula_41. Equivalently, the WOT on formula_41 is formed by taking for basic open neighborhoods those sets of the form

:formula_50

where formula_51 is a finite set, formula_52 is also a finite set, and formula_53. The space formula_41 is a locally convex topological vector space when endowed with the WOT.

The strong operator topology on formula_41 is generated by the family of seminorms formula_56 via the rules formula_57. Thus, a topological base for the SOT is given by open neighborhoods of the form

:formula_58

where as before formula_51 is a finite set, and formula_60

===Relationships between different topologies on &quot;B(X,Y)&quot;===

The different terminology for the various topologies on formula_41 can sometimes be confusing. For instance, &quot;strong convergence&quot; for vectors in a normed space sometimes refers to norm-convergence, which is very often distinct from (and stronger than) than SOT-convergence when the normed space in question is formula_41. The weak topology on a normed space formula_63 is the coarsest topology that makes the linear functionals in formula_64 continuous; when we take formula_41 in place of formula_63, the weak topology can be very different than the weak operator topology. And while the WOT is formally weaker than the SOT, the SOT is weaker than the operator norm topology.

In general, the following inclusions hold:

:formula_67

and these inclusions may or may not be strict depending on the choices of formula_63 and formula_69.

The WOT on formula_41 is a formally weaker topology than the SOT, but they nevertheless share some important properties. For example,

:formula_71

Consequently, if formula_72 is convex then

:formula_73

in other words, SOT-closure and WOT-closure coincide for convex sets.

<text>In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, the strong operator topology, often abbreviated SOT, is the locally convex topology on the set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; induced by the seminorms of the form formula_1, as &quot;x&quot; varies in &quot;H&quot;.

Equivalently, it is the coarsest topology such that, for each fixed &quot;x&quot; in &quot;H&quot;, the evaluation map formula_2 (taking values in &quot;H&quot;) is continuous in T. The equivalence of these two definitions can be seen by observing that a subbase for both topologies is given by the sets formula_3 (where &quot;T0&quot; is any bounded operator on &quot;H&quot;, &quot;x&quot; is any vector and ε is any positive real number).

In concrete terms, this means that formula_4 in the strong operator topology if and only if formula_5 for each &quot;x&quot; in &quot;H&quot;.

The SOT is stronger than the weak operator topology and weaker than the norm topology.

The SOT lacks some of the nicer properties that the weak operator topology has, but being stronger, things are sometimes easier to prove in this topology. It can be viewed as more natural, too, since it is simply the topology of pointwise convergence.

The SOT topology also provides the framework for the measurable functional calculus, just as the norm topology does for the continuous functional calculus. 

The linear functionals on the set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that are continuous in the SOT are precisely those continuous in the weak operator topology (WOT). Because of this, the closure of a convex set of operators in the WOT is the same as the closure of that set in the SOT.

This language translates into convergence properties of Hilbert space operators. For a complex Hilbert space, it is easy to verify by the polarization identity, that Strong Operator convergence implies Weak Operator convergence.

<text>Barbera is a red Italian wine grape variety that, as of 2000, was the third most-planted red grape variety in Italy (after Sangiovese and Montepulciano). It produces good yields and is known for deep color, full body, low tannins and high levels of acidity.

Century-old vines still exist in many regional vineyards and allow for the production of long-aging, robust red wines with intense fruit and enhanced tannic content. The best-known appellation is the DOCG (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita) Barbera d&#x27;Asti in the Piedmont region: the highest-quality Nizza DOCG wines are produced within a sub-zone of the Barbera d&#x27;Asti production area. When young, the wines offer a very intense aroma of fresh red cherries and blackberries. In the lightest versions notes of cherries, raspberries and blueberries and with notes of blackberry and black cherries in wines made of more ripe grapes. Many producers employ the use of toasted oak barrels, which provides for increased complexity, aging potential, and hints of vanilla notes. The lightest versions are generally known for flavors and aromas of fresh fruit and dried fruits, and are not recommended for cellaring. Wines with a better balance between acid and fruit, often with the addition of oak and having a high alcohol content are more capable of cellaring; these wines often result from reduced-yield viticultural methods.

==History==

Barbera is believed to have originated in the hills of Monferrato in central Piemonte, Italy, where it has been known since the thirteenth century. Documents from the cathedral of Casale Monferrato between 1246 and 1277 detail leasing agreements of vineyard lands planted with &quot;de bonis vitibus barbexinis&quot; or Barbera, as it was known then. However, one ampelographer, Pierre Viala, speculates that Barbera originated in the Lombardy region of Oltrepò Pavese. In the 19th and 20th centuries, waves of Italian immigrants brought Barbera to the Americas where the vine took root in California and Argentina among other places. Recent DNA evidence suggest that Barbera may be related to the French-Spanish vine Mourvedre. In 1985, the Piedmont region was rocked by a scandal involving Barbera producers illegally adding methanol to their wines, killing over 30 people and causing many more to lose their sight. The bad press and publicity saw a steady decline in Barbera sales and plantings, allowing the grape to be eclipsed by the Montepulciano grape as Italy&#x27;s second most widely planted red grape variety in the late 1990s.

==Viticulture==
The Barbera vine is very vigorous and capable of producing high yields if not kept in check by pruning and other methods. Excessive yields can diminish the fruit quality in the grape and accentuate Barbera&#x27;s natural acidity and sharpness. In Piedmont, the vine was prized for its yields and ability to ripen two weeks earlier than Nebbiolo even on vineyard sites with less than ideal exposure. This allowed the Piedmontese winemakers in regions like Alba to give their best sites over to the more difficult-to-cultivate Nebbiolo and still produce quality wine with Barbera that could be consumed earlier while the Nebbiolo ages. Harvest for Barbera usually takes place in late September-early October, usually two weeks after Dolcetto has been picked. In recent times, winemakers have been experimenting with harvesting Barbera later at higher sugar levels to produce heavier, more fruit-forward wines. In some vintages, these producers may even harvest their Barbera after Nebbiolo.

Barbera can adapt to a wide range of vineyard soils but tends to thrive most in less fertile calcareous soils and clay loam. Sandy soils can help limit the vigor and yields. The grape rarely thrives in very alkaline or saline soils. Like many grape varieties with a long history, the Barbera vine has seen mutation and clonal variation arise with different clones of the variety found in Piedmont, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and the Mezzogiorno. The different clones can be identified by the size and shape of their grape clusters with the smaller cluster clones producing the highest quality wine. In recent years, viticulturists have been working with clonal selection to increase Barbera&#x27;s resistance to the leafroll virus.

==Winemaking==

Winemakers working with Barbera have a variety of ways to deal with the grape&#x27;s high acidity and moderate astringency. The most common has been through blending with varieties lacking those components and creating a softer and potentially more balanced wine as a result.

In the 1970s, the French enologist Emile Peynaud recommended that Barbera producers use small oak barrels for fermentation and maturation in order to add subtle oak spice flavors and limited levels of oxygenation to soften the wine. The added oxygen would also limit the reductive quality of Barbera and the occurrence of off-odors of hydrogen sulfide that would occur in some examples. The polysaccharides picked up from the oak, was found to increase the richness of Barbera. At the time, his recommendation met some resistance from the tradition-minded Barbera producers, but the success of the &quot;Super Tuscans&quot; which introduced new oak barrel treatment to Sangiovese caused many producers to reconsider. In addition to the subtle oxygenation and spice notes, oak imparts to the wine ligneous wood tannins which give structure to the wine without adding as much astringent bite as the tannins derived from the phenolic compounds of the grape. This, coupled with reduced maceration time, contributed to the production of softer wines. Lower yields and harvesting riper grapes with more fruit and sugar have been found to be a better balance for Barbera&#x27;s high acidity.

==Wine regions==

Northwest Italy is the viticultural home for Barbera, but Italian immigrants spread it through much of the New World, where its acidity is valued in blended wines for the &#x27;freshness&#x27; it imparts. Barbera is found in the northwestern part of Italy, particularly in Monferrato, and to a lesser extent further south. Nearly half of all grapevine plantings in Piedmont are Barbera. It likes the same conditions as Nebbiolo, but the latter is more profitable, fetching nearly twice the price, so is grown on the best sites. The earlier-ripening Barbera is grown on the cooler lower slopes below the Nebbiolo, and other secondary locations. This explains why relatively little Barbera is grown around Alba, where the wines are entitled to the appellation Barbera d&#x27;Alba. Thus the best-known Barbera is the DOCG of Barbera d&#x27;Asti. The Barbera del Monferrato DOC – which tends to be somewhat sparkling (frizzante) – is rarely exported.

Nizza (also Barbera d&#x27;Asti Superiore Nizza before 2014) is a DOCG designation whose zone of production is limited to the comuni (municipalities) of Agliano Terme, Belveglio, Bruno, Calamandrana, Castel Boglione, Castelnuovo Belbo, Castelnuovo Calcea, Castel Rocchero, Cortiglione, Incisa Scapaccino, Moasca, Mombaruzzo, Mombercelli, Nizza Monferrato, Rocchetta Palafea, San Marzano Oliveto, Vaglio Serra and Vinchio within the province of Asti.

===Italy===

As of 2010, there were of Barbera planted, making it the sixth most widely planted red grape variety in Italy. At its highpoint in the late 20th century, there were over planted but the fallout from the &quot;Methanol scandal&quot; of the 1980s and the lack of a driving worldwide market caused those numbers to decline. In the Piedmont region, Barbera is widely grown in the Alba Langhe region and the Asti and Monferrato regions. While there is no officially defined &quot;Classico&quot; region, like Chianti Classico, the region of the Asti province between the towns of Nizza Monferrato, Vinchio, Castelnuovo Calcea, Agliano, Belveglio and Rocchetta is considered among locals to be the &quot;heart&quot; of Barbera in Piedmont. In 2001, the town of Nizza was officially recognized as a sub-region within the greater Barbera d&#x27;Asti DOC. Being one of the warmest areas in Asti, Nizza has the potential to produce the ripest Barbera with sugar levels to match some of the grape&#x27;s high acidity. The wines of Barbera d&#x27;Asti tend to be bright in color and elegant while Barbera d&#x27;Alba tends to have a deep color with more intense, powerful fruit. In the Alba region many of the best vineyard sites are dedicated to Nebbiolo with Barbera relegated to a secondary location, which limits the quality and quantities of the wines labeled with the Barbera d&#x27;Alba DOC. In the Monferrato DOC, Barbera is blended with up to 15% Freisa, Grignolino and Dolcetto and can be slightly sparkling.

Since 2000, it has been possible to produce Barbera d&#x27;Asti Superiore, for which the wine must have an alcoholic strength of at least 12.5% by volume, and be aged for at least 14 months, 6 months of which stored in oak or chestnut barrels. Many superior producers refine it in small oak barriques to obtain a rounder taste. The superior has the following sub-zones indicated on the label: Nizza, Tinella, or Colli Astiani (Asti).
Outside Piedmont, Barbera is found throughout Italy, often as a component in mass &quot;vino da tavola&quot; blends. In the Lombardy region, it is seen as a varietal in Oltrepò Pavese with wines that range from slightly spritzy to semi-sparkling &quot;frizzante&quot;. Elsewhere in Lombardy, it is blended with Croatina and as part of a larger blend component in the red wines of Franciacorta. Southeast of Piedmont, Barbera is found in Emilia-Romagna in the hills between Piacenza, Bologna, and Parma. As in Lombardy, Barbera is often softened by blending with the lighter Croatina as it is in the Val Tidone region for the DOC wine of Gutturnio. In Sardinia, the grape is used around Cagliari in the wine known as Barbera Sarda, and in Sicily, the grape is used in various blends under the names &quot;Perricone&quot; or &quot;Pignatello&quot; made near Agrigento. Barbera was an important grape in re-establishing the wine industry of the Apulia and Campania regions following World War II due to its high yields and easy adaption to mechanical harvesting. Today it is a permitted variety to be blended with Aglianico in the &quot;Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita&quot; (DOCG) wine of Taurasi though it is rarely used.

===Outside Italy===
Although Barbera plantings of over existed as of 2010 outside Italy, it is rarely found in Europe except for small plantings in Greece, Romania, and the coastal region of Primorska in Slovenia.

The influence of Italian immigrants has led to a scattering of Barbera plantings in South America, notably in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. In Argentina, it is widely grown with planted as of 2010, mostly in the Mendoza and San Juan provinces, and used mostly for blending.

There are some small plantings in Israel.

Barbera came to Australia with cuttings imported from the University of California, Davis in the 1960s, and as of 2010 accounted for of planting land. It has been grown for about 25 years in the Mudgee region of New South Wales, with later plantings in a number of wine regions, including the King Valley in Victoria as well as the McLaren Vale and the Adelaide Hills regions in South Australia. John Gladstones, in his book &quot;Viticulture and Environment&quot;, includes Barbera in maturity group 5, which means that it will ripen at about the same time as Shiraz and Merlot, and that it should theoretically find a successful home in many Australian wine regions. 
Australian wine producers have found some success with Barbera in Victoria. Mount Broke Wines of Broke, is one of the few in New South Wales, Australia.

South African producers have begun widespread plantings of the grape in the warm climate regions of Malmesbury, Wellington and Paarl.

In the United States, there are of plantings mostly in California, where Barbera is one of the most successful of the Piemontese grapes to be adopted in the state. It is widely planted in the Central Valley, where it is a blend component in mass-produced jug wines. In recent years, the fashion of Italian grapes has caused more California winemakers to look into producing high-quality varietal Barbera. Plantings in the cooler regions of Napa and Sonoma have produced some successful examples. In Washington State, producers have been experimenting with plantings of Barbera in the Red Mountain, Walla Walla, and Columbia Valley AVAs. So far these very young vines have produced fruity wines with strawberry notes and limited complexity and aging potential. In addition to Washington, in the Umpqua AVA of Oregon plantings of Barbara is proving successful, as well as plantings in central and southern Arizona.

==Wines==
As with many grapes that are widely planted, there is a wide range of quality and variety of Barbera wines from medium bodied, fruity wines to more powerful, intense examples that need cellaring. Some characteristics of the variety are more consistent—namely its deep ruby color, pink rim, pronounced acidity, and normally rather modest levels of tannins. The acidity of Barbera makes it a valued plant in warm climate regions where acidification is usually needed. The color of Barbera makes it a value blending grape and it was historically used in the Barolo &amp; Barberesco region to add color to the natural light Nebbiolo grape.

The use of oak for fermentation or maturation can have a pronounced influence on the flavor and profile of Barbera. Barrel-influenced Barberas tend to be rounder and richer, with more plum and spice notes. Wines made with older or more-neutral oak tend to retain more vibrant aromas and cherry notes. While some producers delay harvest in order to increase sugar levels as a balance to Barbera&#x27;s acidity, over-ripeness can lead to raisiny flavors.

==Relationship to other grapes==
Grape breeder Giovanni Dalmasso at the Instituto Sperimentale per la Viticoltura in Conegliano in the Veneto wine region used Barbera as one of the parent vines for many of his crosses. Along with Nebbiolo di Dronero (originally thought to be Nebbiolo but later discovered to be an old French wine grape known as Chatus), Dalmasso crossed Barbera to produce Albarossa, Cornarea, Nebbiera, San Michele and Soperga.

Barbera is also a parent variety behind Ervi (crossed with Croatina), Incrocio Terezi I (with Cabernet franc), Nigra (with Merlot) and Prodest (also with Merlot).

Despite similarities in names, Barbera has no close genetic relationship with the Campanian wine grape Barbera del Sannio or the Sardinian wine grape Barbera Sarda. Also, DNA analysis has shown that the white Piedmont variety Barbera bianca is not a color mutation of Barbera but rather its own distinct variety.

==Synonyms==
Barbera is known under a variety of local synonyms throughout Italy and worldwide. These include Barber a Raspo, Barbera a Peduncolo, Barbera Amaro, Barbera Crna, Barbera Forte, Barbera Mercantile, Barbera Nera, Barbera Nostrana, Barbera Riccia, Barbera Rissa, Barbera Rosa, Barbera Vera, Barberone, Barbexinis, Besgano, Cosses Barbusen, Gaietto, Lombardesca, Perricone, Pignatello and Ughetta.

<text>Dark Season is a British science-fiction television serial for adolescents, screened on BBC1 in late 1991. 
==Premise== 
Made up of six 25-minute episodes, the two linked three-part stories tell the adventures of three teenagers and their battle to save their school and their classmates from the actions of the sinister Mr Eldritch. It was the first television drama to be written by Russell T Davies, and is also noteworthy for co-starring a young Kate Winslet in her first major television role.

==Background==
Russell T Davies was a BBC staff producer working for the children&#x27;s department at BBC Manchester, running the summertime activity show &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You?&quot;. He had gained some television writing experience scripting the comedy dubbed version of &quot;The Flashing Blade&quot; for the Saturday morning children&#x27;s programme &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; in 1989 and the children&#x27;s sketch show &quot;Breakfast Serials&quot; the following year, but his real ambition was to write television drama.

To this end, he wrote an on-spec script for the first episode of &quot;Dark Season&quot; – originally titled &quot;The Adventuresome Three&quot; – and used the BBC&#x27;s internal mail system to send it directly to the Head of Children&#x27;s Programmes, Anna Home. Impressed with the script, Home asked Davies to write a second episode. When Tony Robinson decided to take a break from producing &quot;Maid Marian and Her Merry Men&quot;, a slot opened up in the Children&#x27;s BBC schedules for late 1991 and Home decided to use &quot;Dark Season&quot; to fill it, commissioning Davies to write the remaining episodes of the serial. The series was filmed in Mytchett in Surrey, in Farnborough, Hampshire (Woburn Avenue) and the long-closed Robert Haining Secondary School, in the summer of 1991. Studio scenes were shot at the BBC&#x27;s Ealing Studios.

Transmitted at 4.35 pm on Thursdays from 14 November to 19 December 1991, each episode would be repeated the Sunday morning following first broadcast. Viewing figures varied from 3.6 to 4.2 million per episode. Davies also penned a novelisation of &quot;Dark Season&quot; for BBC Books, which was released concurrently with the transmission of the serial and was advertised after each episode. He would later go on to write a second children&#x27;s science-fiction serial for the BBC, &quot;Century Falls&quot;, in 1993, before forging a long and successful career in adult television drama. &quot;Dark Season&quot; was re-shown on BBC One in 1994, and in 2002 was also repeated on the CBBC Channel on digital television, cropped to 14:9 widescreen with the loss of the top and bottom sections of the original picture.

&quot;Dark Season&quot; was released on DVD by 2|entertain Ltd on 24 July 2006. Upon this release, it received a British Board of Film Classification rating of PG.

==Plot==
The first three episodes begin with third year secondary school girl Marcie and her two fifth year friends Tom and Reet becoming suspicious of the sinister Mr Eldritch, whose computer company arrives at the school and distributes free computers to all the pupils.

With the reluctant help of their teacher Miss Maitland they apparently defeat the threat of Eldritch, who disappears. However, the second three episodes tell of the actions of Miss Pendragon, who works for Eldritch and is attempting to revive the massive, secret Behemoth computer from its long-hidden location beneath the school.

At the end of the BBC novelisation, there are indications that Davies had ideas or interest in a potential third adventure using the same characters. A single paragraph describing the opening of an amusement arcade concludes with &quot;...but that&#x27;s another story.&quot;

The director assigned to &quot;Dark Season&quot; was Colin Cant, who had a long and highly esteemed reputation in producing BBC children&#x27;s programmes, having for many years produced the popular school-based teen drama &quot;Grange Hill&quot; throughout the 1980s and directed classic children&#x27;s serials such as &quot;Moondial&quot; (1988).

The three stars were 19-year-old Victoria Lambert as the 13-year-old Marcie, Ben Chandler as Tom and Kate Winslet, in her first major professional acting role, as Reet. There were several supporting actors who were well-known names on British television: Miss Maitland was played by Brigit Forsyth who had starred in the popular sitcom &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot; in the 1970s, and Miss Pendragon was played by Jacqueline Pearce, who was well known for her role as the villainous Servalan in the late 1970s / early 80s BBC science-fiction series &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, and known by Cant from working with her on the serial &quot;Moondial&quot;. According to an interview with &quot;SFX magazine&quot;, Davies said that Pearce was delighted that her character was supposed to be a lesbian, but refused to dye her hair, hence the turban.

==Structure==
The episodes were merely numbered, all sharing a gradually-revealed common plot. The six episodes are divided into two stories of three episodes each. The apparent conclusion of the first story at episode 3 seemed so complete to BBC executives that they were, according to Davies, &quot;a bit shocked&quot;. This, in part, stemmed from the fact that he had not sold the programme to them as two three-part stories—&quot;in case they told me not to do it!&quot;. By the conclusion of episode 6 it becomes apparent to the viewer that all six episodes tell a conjoined story, though split across two seemingly unrelated tales.

==Episodes==
==Reception==
The show received increased critical attention following both its release on DVD and Davies&#x27; announcement of his programme aimed at the same target audience, &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;.

Television Heaven&#x27;s review concluded by saying, &quot;By turns amusing, aware, suspenseful, exciting and imaginative, &#x27;Dark Season&#x27; stands as an almost criminally overlooked example of children&#x27;s genre television of the highest quality, and also as an early indication of a future major creative talent in the form of Russell T Davies taking his first steps on the long and winding creative road to a glittering future.&quot;

Head writer of series 1 of &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, Gareth Roberts, found career inspiration in &quot;Dark Season&quot;. He has said that &quot;Dark Season&quot; &quot;was exactly what I wanted to do at the time—write a cracking kids&#x27; sci-fi show.&quot;

Likewise, DVD Times called it &quot;an enjoyable story&quot;, but criticised the split of the plot into two-halves as &quot;clumsy&quot;. It further bemoaned a &quot;tendency towards handwaving and gobbledygook to resolve the plot(s)&quot;.

==Commonality with &quot;Doctor Who&quot;==
&quot;Dark Season&quot; contained some similarity to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which Russell T Davies revived in 2005. Most notably, Marcie occupies a similar narrative space to the Doctor, with Reet and Thomas as her companions. Nevertheless, this broad structural similarity to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has been categorically denied by Russell T Davies as intentional. Davies has claimed that the only direct reference to so-called &quot;classic&quot; &quot;Doctor Who&quot; is a scene in which Reet uses a yo-yo to test gravity.

Nevertheless, elements from this production have been seen in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fiction which &quot;post&quot;-dates &quot;Dark Season&quot;.

The earliest reference was a direct mention of Marcie in Davies&#x27; 1996 &quot;Doctor Who – The New Adventures&quot; novel &quot;Damaged Goods&quot;. Later, when &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was again being produced on television, Davies trapped Rose Tyler behind a door that refused to open In &quot;The End of the World&quot; – just as he had done with Reet in Episode Six of &quot;Dark Season&quot;. When challenged by their rescuers not to go anywhere, both characters offered the same response: &quot;Where am I gonna go, Ipswich?&quot;. &quot;Dark Season&quot; would again be recalled in 2006, when the similarity between the setting of &quot;Dark Season&quot; and the 2006 episode &quot;School Reunion&quot; received frequent attention. Though Davies did not write the script for &quot;School Reunion&quot;, he requested its relocation from an army base to a school, evocative of &quot;Dark Season&quot;.

By far the strongest links between the serials are found in Davies&#x27; 2008 Christmas special, &quot;The Next Doctor&quot;, which recycles elements of the &#x27;Behemoth&#x27; in the &#x27;CyberKing&#x27;. In both &quot;Dark Season&quot; and &quot;The Next Doctor&quot;, the lead female villains are tricked into enthronement &amp; entrapment inside a monster of their own making, which they accept as their destiny, but this leads to their downfall.

==Revival==
In September 2021, Russell T Davies announced that he was working on an audiobook version of the original TV show (released in November 2021) and a possible sequel. A Sequel audiodrama announcement was confirmed in November 2022 and was released in May 2023 on Big Finish Productions.

<doc id="458724" wikidata="Q608194" url="?curid=458724" title="Boscombe">
<text>Boscombe () is a suburb in Bournemouth England. Historically in Hampshire, but today in Dorset, it is located to the east of Bournemouth town centre and west of Southbourne.

Originally a sparsely inhabited area of heathland, from around 1865 Boscombe developed rapidly from a small village into a seaside resort alongside Bournemouth. Its first pier opened in 1889.

There are numerous architectural styles within the town, ranging from the elaborate Victorian style of the Royal Arcade and St Clement&#x27;s Church, notable examples of Art Deco such as the former Gas &amp; Water Company store at 709 Christchurch Road, and the modernist 1950s styles of the pier and Overstrand buildings. Alongside these are modern flats developments such as The Reef, The Point (sometimes called the Pointer by some residents) and Honeycombe Beach.

The nickname &quot;Bos Vegas&quot; has gained popularity in recent years and occurs with slight spelling variation in the names of two Boscombe businesses.

Boscombe is home to AFC Bournemouth, who play at Dean Court. Many fans still refer to AFC Bournemouth as Boscombe, a reference to the original names of &quot;Boscombe St John&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Bournemouth &amp; Boscombe Athletic FC&quot; (the word Boscombe was dropped in 1972).

There is a thriving street market in the High Street on Thursdays and Saturdays as well as a vintage market on the first Saturday of every month.

==Geography and administration==
The area upon which Boscombe is situated, between the somewhat older village of Pokesdown and Bournemouth Square, was part of the great heathland which covered much of western Hampshire, and extended well into eastern Dorset. From Norman times it was within the Liberty of Westover. From the beach and cliffs the whole of Poole Bay stretching from Hengistbury Head in the east to Poole Harbour entrance in the west, and on to Studland and Swanage bays to the south can be seen.

Boscombe was originally an independent settlement, separated from Bournemouth by dense wood and moorland, it was incorporated into the boundaries of Bournemouth in 1876 (against the wishes of Boscombe residents).

==History==
In 1273 a reference is made to &quot;Boscumbe&quot;, suggesting that the name may have derived from the Old English words meaning a &#x27;valley overgrown with spiky plants&#x27;; perhaps a reference to gorse.

Boscombe is mentioned in Christopher Saxton&#x27;s 1574 survey of possible enemy landing places on the coast of Hampshire: &quot;Bournemouth within the west baye at Christchurch...We finde more a place called Bastowe within the said Baye&quot;. Saxton&#x27;s map of 1575 shows a Copperas House at Bascomb, which refers to the manufacture of copperas or ferrous sulphate which took place in the district, particularly in the last quarter of the 16th century.

At the beginning of the 19th century, Boscombe was described as an extensive common covered with furze and heath, more the haunt of smugglers than anyone else. One of the early landmarks was the &#x27;Ragged Cat&#x27;, a wayside inn dating from 1850, later renamed the &#x27;Palmerston&#x27; and then &#x27;Deacons&#x27;, it was renamed back to &#x27;The Ragged Cat&#x27; in 2009 before being closed down. In 2015 a Polish market was opened in this historic building.

===Boscombe Manor===
In 1801, a modestly-sized house called Boscombe Cottage was built as the residence of Mr Phillip Norris. The Christchurch Inclosures Act 1802 increased the estate size to . This property became the nucleus of the Boscombe Manor Estate.

The large estate owned by Mr Norris changed hands several times during the first half of the 19th century. After Norris&#x27;s death it was acquired by Robert Heathcote, and on his death the estate was put up for auction The estate was purchased by James Dover, in whose possession it remained until 1841; then it was sold to Major Stephenson.

Stevenson sold the estate in 1849 to Sir Percy Shelley, 3rd Baronet, who bought the Boscombe property mainly with the intention of it becoming a home for his mother Mary Shelley, but she died in London on 1 February 1851. Sir Percy and his wife liked the place, and decided to make it their home, dividing their time between Boscombe and their London house at Chelsea.

The house at Boscombe was extensively rebuilt for Sir Percy, and extended to include a 200-seat (later 300 seats) theatre, to the designs of Christopher Crabb Creeke, who later became surveyor to the Bournemouth Improvement Commissioners and was responsible for both the layout of much of central Bournemouth&#x27;s roads, and for several local buildings.

It may be noted that the name of Boscombe Manor changed several times over the years. First recorded as Boscombe Cottage, it was then for a time called Boscombe Alcove and then Boscombe Lodge. By Shelley&#x27;s time it was Boscombe House, and he and his family later renamed it Boscombe Manor. In the present century it was Groveley Manor for many years, taking the name of the school which then occupied it, but now it is known as Shelley Park, most of the building being taken up by the Shelley Manor Medical Centre in Beechwood Avenue.

To supplement the existing plantations of pine trees on the estate, Sir Percy added a large number of deciduous trees. There was a drive to the house from the main Christchurch Road, which followed the line of the present Chessel Avenue, and there was a lodge at its entrance. A second entry was from Sea Road, along a roadway flanked with lime trees – the present Percy Road.

By the beginning of the 1860s Boscombe consisted of the Shelley estate and some cottages, one of which is known to have stood at the top of Boscombe Hill, near the present Drummond Road.

From 1865 the development and expansion of the area to the end of the 19th century, and beyond, was very rapid. Starting with a proposal by the Malmesbury Estate to develop the &#x27;picturesque Village of Boscombe Spa&#x27; to make available building plots for the erection of marine villas to be let on long leases.

The Spa was related to a natural spring of mineral water containing properties, similar to Harrogate, which had been discovered near the foot of the hill; this would be available for invalids and could combine the advantages of a Spa with those of sea air and bathing.

The scheme was not implemented; instead about of land was obtained by Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, on part of which he built a house for himself named Boscombe Towers, in 1868. Sir Henry became closely associated with the development of Boscombe Spa for a considerable number of years. Wolff sought to develop &#x27;Boscombe Spa&#x27; as a resort to rival Bournemouth and it was he who created the Boscombe Chine Gardens. In order to encourage the taking of the mineral water from the spring at the mouth of the Chine, a small thatched-roof building resembling a summer house was erected over the spring, and for a time this became a fashionable meeting place. The Chine itself was partially laid out and a broad pathway provided. A rustic bridge was constructed across the Chine.

The census of 1871 showed that there was a population of 212 people in 19 houses in the Boscombe Estate, and a further 70 people in 9 houses at Boscombe Spa. 

During the 1870s development of Boscombe was such that the population at the census of 1881 had grown to 1,895 – a more than sixfold increase.

===Expansion===
In 1875 a 160,000 gallon water tower was built in Palmerston Road, at this time it was stated that there were 244 houses in Boscombe. In February 1877 the Royal Boscombe Hospital (later called the Royal Victoria Hospital) opened in Shelley Road, it initially had beds for 12 patients. In 1880 Boscombe Land Society was formed purchasing 13 acres of land in November 1881. This was in the area of the present Knole Road, there were initially 73 plots. Much of the Shelley property in the area to the east of Sea Road was developed in the next ten years amounting to a further 70 plots. In 1883 Pokesdown station opened on the LSWR Brockenhurst to Bournemouth line. In 1889 Boscombe Pier opened &quot;(see below)&quot;. The commercial centre of Boscombe had a major boost with projects by Archibald Beckett including blocks of shops, the Salisbury Hotel, the Royal Arcade, and a Grand Theatre, which was to become Boscombe Hippodrome, then the Royal Ballrooms and today the O2 Academy. These were all built between 1888 and 1895, shortly after opening in 1892 the Royal Arcade was lit by electricity. On 29 May 1897 Boscombe railway station was opened. On 19 August 1893 the Burlington Hotel opened; it was designed in an Italian Renaissance style and had 200 bedrooms. By the turn of the century the remainder of the Shelley estate had been sold, Boscombe Chine gardens had been laid out and there was little remaining vacant land within Boscombe. Before her death in June 1899 Lady Shelley had gifted four acres of land which were laid out to form Boscombe Cliff Gardens. In the 1901 census the population was 9,648.

===20th century===

The coronation of King Edward VII and his Queen, Alexandra of Denmark was scheduled to take place on 26 June 1902; to mark the occasion, Bournemouth Council agreed on 20 May 1902 to rename common No 59 as &quot;King&#x27;s Park&quot;. Boscombe thrived with the growth of the English seaside holiday. Between the World Wars, Boscombe was one of Bournemouth&#x27;s wealthiest areas with many large Victorian and Edwardian family houses. In 1935, construction started on San Remo Towers, a block of 164 flats designed by Hector Hamilton in a Los Angeles Spanish style. Post-war there was a boom in the seaside holiday market, and Boscombe with its large number of smaller guest houses enjoyed this period of prosperity. In 1965, Boscombe railway station closed.

In the 1970s and 1980s, with the decline in the traditional English holiday market, Boscombe&#x27;s fortunes began to wane. Many of the small guest houses and large family houses became houses in multiple occupation. A 2006 report for Bournemouth Council stated:

Boscombe saw an increase in social problems during this period with drug and alcohol dependency levels well above the national average.

The Royal Bournemouth Hospital was opened in 1989 and replaced the Royal Victoria Hospital.

===Recent history===
New development of the area around Boscombe was approved under the Boscombe Spa Development Plan in July 2006. This project was intended to turn the seafront into a spa village complete with artificial surf created by Boscombe Surf Reef. Completed in autumn 2009, the reef was constructed as part of the restoration work that also included the Overstrand buildings. Reports on the reef&#x27;s performance showed that it was failing to meet its performance criteria. In 2011, the reef was closed for safety reasons; in 2012 the contractor went out of business and in 2014 the reef was re-branded as a Coastal Activity Park. Funding for the development had been through the sale of the local seafront car park, to Barratt Homes for 169 seafront apartments, at Honeycombe Chine. As well as these flats there have been a number of other large developments of flats such as &quot;The Reef&quot; in Boscombe Spa Road and the renovation of Shelley Park into a medical centre and flats development.

In May 2007, for the first time, a property in Boscombe sold for £1 million. The property was a flat with views of the coast, and was the main headline in the &quot;Bournemouth Daily Echo&quot;. Boscombe gardens underwent a renovation project and was substantially remodelled; a public art trail was also installed around Boscombe as part of the renovation project.

==Schools and arts centre==
In the 1870s a small school attached to St Clement&#x27;s Church was too small to meet the growing demand. Boscombe British school was established by Frederick Moser and Sir Percy Shelley, who laid the foundation stone at a site on Gladstone Road in 1878. The school was built in a Neo-Gothic style and opened in 1879; the &quot;Christchurch Times&quot; reported that it was &quot;to be one of the most ornamental as well as useful buildings in Boscombe.&quot; Later, when transferred to the local authority, the school was renamed St. John&#x27;s Church of England Primary School. The senior section of the school moved in 1940 to the newly built Boscombe Bilateral Secondary Modern (now King&#x27;s Park Primary) on Ashley Road.

In 1960, local teacher Leslie Williams formed the Bournemouth Children&#x27;s Theatre in the old school buildings, which later became the Drama Centre. Dame Sybil Thorndike became the patron of the centre and visited frequently. In the 1980s the Drama Centre was renamed the Bournemouth Centre for Community Arts (BCCA) to reflect its extension into other arts. Gareth Malone attended, later going on to be known as a choirmaster on BBC televised programmes. After it was closed in 2007 and under threat of demolition, the Friends of the BCCA contacted English Heritage to help save the building; it was Grade II listed in 2008. In June 2012, despite 938 objections, and claims the Planning Board had been &quot;misled&quot;, planning permission was obtained to restore the listed rooms and to build 11 affordable homes for local people (10 houses and an accessible bungalow), a community orchard and allotments. Demolition took place in October 2013. A mock funeral was held by protesters hoping to stop the demolition.

The Religious of the Cross operated a Roman Catholic boarding and day convent school for girls, and later also a boys&#x27; preparatory school, built at 13, Parkwood Road in 1889. The school was subsequently extended to accommodate a separate junior school. This building has housed the Anglo-European College of Chiropractic since 1982.

Other schools in Boscombe are St James&#x27;s Church of England Primary, Corpus Christi Catholic Primary (next to Corpus Christi Church), Bethany Primary, Avonbourne Girls Academy, and Avonbourne Boys Academy.

==Boscombe Chine==

Boscombe Chine, the ravine breaking through the sandy cliffs, comprised several small valleys draining the land around Boscombe. Several of these originated in Springbourne, but they all eventually confluenced near to Christchurch Road. The southern end of the chine was laid out as pleasure gardens with a surface water stream as a picturesque feature. Towards the foot of the Chine, near to Sea Road, a chalybeate spring was discovered, no doubt fed by the water draining into the chine. A small thatched hut was erected over the spring and was given the name Boscombe Spa. The water was sufficiently foul-tasting that people would make a special trip to drink the water for any health-giving properties that it may contain.

==Boscombe Pier==

A pier was proposed in 1884 as a visitor attraction. In September 1888 the contract for its building was awarded for £3,813, and for making the pier approach £938. The pier was long, and built in spans of each with a continuous wrought iron girder frame, which carried timber decking wide. The pier head was long and wide, with a landing stage on each side, at which excursion steamers could call. At the entrance were two toll houses with turnstiles. The architect for the pier construction was James Stuart Campbell McEwan-Brown (1870–1949). His family were originally from Kintyre, Argyll and were closely connected to the Duke of Argyll. It is no surprise therefore, that it was opened with considerable ceremony on 29 July 1889 by the Duke of Argyll.

The pier head was not added until 1926, and like most piers it was partially demolished during World War II to combat the threat of invasion. The pier remained derelict for a number of years and was only fully reopened in 1962. The borough architect, John Burton, designed the modernist 1950s style entrance building. This building was Grade II listed in 2004, The heritage minister said: The building at the pier end was initially reopened as the Mermaid Theatre and then a roller skating rink before becoming an amusement arcade. It closed in 1989 and the pier became progressively more derelict over the next 19 years.

On 30 October 2005 the pier was closed as it was deemed unsafe. The Grade II listed pier entrance building was externally restored in 2007 together with a restoration of the pier neck. New decking, lighting and central windbreak screen was added together with a new viewing and fishing platform end section, replacing the derelict Mermaid Amusement Hall. The pier re-opened in May 2008. To the east of the pier is Europe&#x27;s first artificial surf reef.

Since the re-opening of the pier in 2008 a Friends Association has been established, organising art exhibitions and live music performances. In 2009, website &quot;Nothing To See Here&quot; named it &quot;Britain’s coolest&quot; and the National Piers Society voted it &quot;Pier of the Year 2010&quot;.

In 2014, a musical walkway was added to the pier, featuring 88 custom-made chimes that play ‘I Do Like To be Beside the Seaside’ when struck in the correct order. The outdoor musical installation includes tubular bells, a bell lyre and tembos.

The pier also has its own dedicated angling club, The Boscombe Pier Sea Anglers, founded in 2002 for out of hours fishing.


==The Boscombe Devil==
The Boscombe Devil is a grotesque on a building facing the Boscombe Grand Theatre (now the O2 Academy), placed there in the 1920s by the Lord&#x27;s Day Observance Society to show disapproval at the theatre&#x27;s decision to open on Sundays.

== Politics ==
Boscombe is part of two wards for elections to Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council which elect two councillors each; Boscombe East and Pokesdown and Boscombe West.

Boscombe is part of the Bournemouth East parliamentary constituency, for elections to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.

<doc id="458725" wikidata="Q1226021" url="?curid=458725" title="Braunton">
<text>Braunton is a large village, civil parish, ecclesiastical parish and former manor in Devon. The village is situated west of Barnstaple. It is one of the largest villages in Devon with a population at the 2021 census of 10,217 people. There are two electoral wards (East and West). Their joint population at the above census was 8,218. Within the parish is the fertile, low-lying Braunton Great Field, which adjoins the undulating Braunton Burrows, the Core Area in North Devon Biosphere Reserve, the largest psammosere (sand dune system) in England. It confronts the Atlantic Ocean at the west of the parish at the large beach of Saunton Sands, one of the South West&#x27;s international-standard surfing beaches.

==Toponymy==
The origin of the name Braunton is unclear; there are two likely explanations for the name. The first is that the name comes from the common name Brampton, derived from &quot;a town where broom grew&quot;. The other explanation is that it could be named after St Brannock. Neither of these explanations fit perfectly, and the origin of this name will likely remain a mystery.

==Topography==
The South West Coast Path National Trail passes through the village and gives access for walkers to the spectacular North Devon coast. The Tarka Trail also passes through the village. Braunton Burrows marsh on the west side of the parish is a designated biosphere reserve, the first place in Great Britain to have gained such status. The coastal part of the parish lies within the North Devon Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and comprises Saunton Sands to the west, a beach of finely-grained sand, and to the south the estuary of the River Taw, of mixed mud and sand. The north of Braunton Burrows are open to light public access and have been converted into a Links Golf Course. Braunton was half-surrounded by an extensive salt-water marsh restricting available agricultural land. In 1808 this was surveyed by Charles Vancouver, for the Board of Agriculture, who recommended that the marsh should be enclosed and reclaimed. This met with local approval and James Green was appointed as engineer for the drainage scheme. An Act of Parliament was obtained for the purpose on 25 May 1811. On completion, responsibility for the marsh passed Marsh Inspectors, who sanctioned further work in 1854, involving the straightening and embanking of the River Caen, or Braunton Pill, to form the Braunton Canal. The scheme was completed by the addition of a new quay at Velator in the 1870s.

To the West of Braunton is Saunton and its beach and the sand dune system but bordering the village is what is reputed to be the largest remaining &#x27;strip&#x27; farming area in the UK and which known as the &#x27;Great Field&#x27; . Probably from medieval times and continuing today, this large area has been opened tilled without formal boundaries, with at least 3 families still involved in production. This boundary effect by the &#x27;Great Field&#x27; now acts as a &#x27;natural&#x27; barrier to the development of the town in that direction.

During building works in the end of the 20th century, two strange findings revealed something of the areas geology. In one area of the village high on the side of the hill and about above the flat area of the village, excavations for 1 m deep foundations of a house broke in to a pocket of sand which was found to extend greater than 5 m. The subsequent house had to be built on a raft on the sand. The sand was understood to have been examined by Exeter University, who considered it to have been a pocket pushed up by a glacier during the last ice age. At similar time in the flat area of the village, excavations for foundations revealed large sooth, rounded stones which were put down to a wide water course having been present at some time, rather than the small river that flows through the village now.

Braunton railway station formerly existed on the now closed Ilfracombe Branch Line two stations from Barnstaple railway station on the &#x27;Tarka&#x27; or North Devon Line from Exeter, which currently operate regular and heritage trains.

The presence of the river, the &#x27;soft&#x27; water and permission for abstraction, encouraged an American company, &#x27;Curity&#x27; to set up business in the village in the early 60&#x27;s for the purposes of bleaching and processing imported raw cotton wool from the US into various products such as cotton wool balls, and rolls of perfectly white cotton for other companies to make such products as tampons and other medical/surgical products. Despite being in operation for about 40 years, the softness of the water and minimal [resin] &#x27;ion exchange&#x27; meant that the &#x27;Steambloc&#x27; boilers needed no treatment or aggressive cleaning.

==Climate==
Braunton has an oceanic climate that is heavily moderated by the proximity to the Atlantic. Although Braunton is not a coast town.
==History==

===Manors===
Braunton was the chief manor of Braunton Hundred, and had been held by Saxon kings. Between 855 and 860 ten hides in &quot;Brannocminster&quot; were granted by King Æthelbald of Wessex to Glastonbury Abbey. After the Norman Conquest of 1066 the manor continued as a royal possession, in the demesne of King William the Conqueror. In the Domesday Book of 1086 (Exon Version) it is recorded as held at farm by Baldwin the Sheriff, Sheriff of Devon, whose fiefdom of 176 landholdings as recorded in Domesday Book was the largest in Devon. As recorded in the Domesday Book one virgate of land had been administratively transferred from the manor of Braunton to the tenure of Robert &quot;de Pont Chardon&quot;, lord of the manor adjoining of Heanton Punchardon. The royal manor was eventually split into three parts:

====Braunton Dean====
Braunton Dean, which probably represented the land granted by King William the Conqueror to &quot;Algar the Priest&quot; at some time before the compilation of the Domesday Book of 1086. Together with the Rectory of Braunton, it shortly afterwards came into the possession of the Dean of Exeter. In 1810 it was held, as a tenant of the Dean and Chapter, by Charles Trelwany of Coldrenick in Cornwall.

====Braunton Abbots====
Braunton Abbots, which extended also over part of the adjoining parish of Marwood. It was created by a grant from the remnant of the royal manor of Braunton by King Henry III (1216–1272) to Cleeve Abbey in Somerset. In 1810 it belonged to William Courtenay, 9th Earl of Devon (1768–1835) of Powderham

====Braunton Gorges====
Braunton Gorges, was held by the de Sachville family. Robert de Sachville (Latinized to &quot;de Siccavilla&quot; (&quot;from the dry town&quot;)) had been granted this part in 1202. Their successors were the Gorges family of Wraxall, Somerset. As is recorded in a surviving document, in 1324 Eleanor Ferre, wife of Ralph de Gorges (d.1323), Baron Gorges, Sheriff of Devon, and daughter of Sir John Ferre of Tothill, Lincolnshire, was granted lands at Braunton including 1 acre at &#x27;La Crofta&#x27;, two acres at &#x27;Myddelforlong&#x27;, and half an acre at &#x27;Longeland&#x27;, which names (if not spellings) are still in use today. In 1330 as is recorded in the Calendar of Fine Rolls:

Waleys, by a fine levied at Westminster in the octave of Michaelmas, 4 Edward III, granted to Ralph Gorges two-thirds of the manor of Braunton Gorges by the name of two-thirds of 3 messuages, 2 carucates of land and 100s. of rent in the same town of Braunton, together with the reversion of the third part thereof which John Pecche and Eleanor, his wife, both now deceased, held as dower of the said Eleanor of the inheritance of the aforesaid Walter, to hold the same to himself and the heirs male of his body, with remainder in default of such heirs to William son of Theobald Russell and the heirs male of his body, and remainder in default of such heirs to Theobald brother of the said William and the heirs male of his body, and that the said Ralph and William died without heirs male of their bodies, and that Theobald brother of William entered the premises by virtue of the said fine, took to wife Agnes late the wife of Theobald Gorges, &quot; chivaler,&quot; had issue by her Bartholomew Gorges and Thomas Gorges, and died seised of the premises, after whose death the said Bartholomew entered the manor as his son and heir male, and died seised of the two-thirds aforesaid without leaving an heir male of his body, so that the two-thirds and reversion ought to remain to the said Thomas, who is of full age, as brother and heir male of Bartholomew, and that the manor is held of the king by the service of rendering to the king a barbed arrow whenever he hunts in the Forest of Exemore, &quot;to take the fealty of the said Thomas, and cause him to have full seisin of the said two-thirds and reversion&quot;.

Sir Theobald de Gorges (d. 1381) died seized of this estate and was succeeded by his son Ralph de Gorges, succeeded by his son Bartholomew de Gorges. In 1810 it was owned, together with Ash, Fullabrook and Braunton Park, by Joseph Davie Basset (1764–1846), later of Watermouth Castle, near Lynmouth, son of John Davie of Orleigh Court, near Bideford, by his wife Eleanora Basset, sister and heiress of Francis Basset (c. 1740–1802) of Heanton Punchardon and Umberleigh. In accordance with the terms of the inheritance, as was then usual in such cases, Joseph Davie and his descendants adopted the arms and surname of Basset in lieu of their patronymic.

===St Brannock&#x27;s Church===
The grade I listed parish church, dedicated to St. Brannock, is large and has a Norman tower topped by a spire. A fine series of richly carved 16th century bench-ends survive with other interesting carved woodwork. The building is almost entirely 15th century, excepting the 13th century chancel with its arch and three lancet windows. The advowson of the parish church was historically a possession of Exeter Cathedral (&quot;St Mary and St Peter&quot;).

====Monuments and furnishings====
In the floor of the choir is an unusual monumental brass which is a palimpsest, i.e. it has been re-used. It depicts on its uppermost side Elizabeth Bourchier (d.1548), a daughter of John Bourchier, 1st Earl of Bath of Tawstock Court, feudal baron of Bampton, Devon, and the wife of Edward Chichester (d.1522) of Raleigh in the nearby parish of Pilton. Her husband inherited the estate of Saunton, in the parish of Braunton, from his mother Margaret Beaumont, daughter and heiress of Hugh Beaumont of Shirwell, and her 3rd son Philip Chichester was seated at Saunton, where his mother may have spent her widowhood. Alternatively she may have lived at Ash, in the parish of Braunton, which in the 16th century the Bourchiers purchased from the Bellew family, whilst the Bourchiers also owned the estate of Beare in the parish of Braunton. A 16th-century wooden chest survives, with engravings of Portuguese men who may have come to England with the Spanish Armada of 1588.

====St. Brannock====

In 550 the missionary St. Brannock sailed from South Wales and converted the native Britons to Christianity. Brannock was a priest in the household of Brychan, King of Brecknock. He married one of the king&#x27;s daughters, but due to family troubles left his royal home. At that time the Welsh Britons often raided their Dumnonian neighbours in North Devon, on the south side of the Bristol Channel.

Brannock probably came to North Devon with one such raid and is said to have landed at Saunton Sands, then dense woodland before later wind-erosion into sand-dunes, at the mouth of the River Taw. Brannock settled among a tribe of local Britons and soon established a strong Christian community. A church, the first in North Devon, was built near where the Caen Stream began to spread its waters on the alluvial lands around the River Taw. &quot;Brannockstood&quot;, the township that grew up around this church, later became &quot;Brantone&quot; and at the end of the 19th century, Braunton.

The story has it that Brannock tried to build the church on the hill overlooking the settlement but it kept being damaged by the weather and in a dream he saw a pigsty with piglets. At the foot of the hill he built the current church over the sty where it still remains, and the central wooden boss in the church depicts a sow and piglets. The remains of the original church remain on the hill.

==Demography==
The population of Braunton, according to the census of 1801, was 1,296. This number increased quite rapidly in the thirty years to 1831, to 2,047 however the rate of increase slowed during the next 10 years and coinciding with the arrival of the railway fell from 2,364 in 1851 to 2,089 in 1881. Population growth resumed and saw almost a doubling between 1961 and 2011, to 8,128 people. Data for 1801–1961 is available at Britain Through Time. The 2001 and 2011 Censuses give detailed information about the village. The settlement&#x27;s population in 2011 were living in 3,552 households.

==Historic estates==
Several of the historic estates within the parish of Braunton have expanded into larger settlements. They include:

===Wrafton===
Wrafton almost adjoins to the south and some of its affinity, particularly economic, is with Braunton instead of its civil parish, Heanton Punchardon further along the straight, semi-coastal road towards Barnstaple.

===Lobb and North Lobb===
WNW of the village centre is a modest farm, Fairlynch, followed by a farm-courtyard cluster of buildings, Lobb and then north, by three springs in a cleft (lowland half-bowl) of the Saunton Down upland ridge is a similar cluster, North Lobb with no road access from these places other than to Braunton but a footpath (Milkaway Lane) to Croyde and a similarly downhill branch to the south, Hannaborrow Lane to Saunton Sands.

===Ash===

The Museum of British Surfing opened in 2012 in the old goods shed of the old Braunton Railway Station on the Ilfracombe Branch Line.

<text>The Mennonite Brethren Church is an evangelical Mennonite Anabaptist movement with .

==History==
The conference was established among Plautdietsch-speaking Russian Mennonites in 1860. During the 1850s, some Mennonites were influenced by Radical Pietism, which found its way into the Mennonite colonies of the southern Russian Empire now known as Ukraine. Mennonite immigrants from West Prussia who had been influenced by pietistic leaders transplanted those ideas to the large Molotschna colony. The pastor of a neighboring congregation, Eduard Wüst, reinforced this pietism. Wüst was a revivalist who stressed repentance and Christ as a personal savior, influencing Catholics, Lutherans and Mennonites in the area. He associated with many Mennonite leaders, including Leonhard Sudermann.

In 1859, Joseph Höttmann, a former associate of Wüst met with a group of Mennonites to discuss problems within the main Mennonite body. Their discussion centered on participating in communion with church members who were living in a way that seemed unholy or were not converted, and baptism of adults by immersion, which was distinct from other Mennonite churches who primarily baptized by pouring.

On January 6, 1860, this growing group of Mennonites influenced by a combination of Prussian Mennonite pietism, contacts with Moravian Brethren and indirectly through the influential preaching of Eduard Wüst, met in the village of Elisabeththal, Molotschna and formed the Mennonite Brethren Church. They felt that other Mennonites had grown cold and formal, and were seeking greater emphasis on discipline, prayer and Bible study. The group presented a document to the elders of the Molotschna Mennonite Churches which indicated &quot;that the total Mennonite brotherhood has decayed to the extent that we can no more be part of it&quot; and fear the &quot;approach of an unavoidable judgment of God.&quot; The immediate catalyst for the new organization was the discipline placed on a body of brethren who met to observe communion in a private home without the elders&#x27; sanction. The Mennonite Brethren were also in contact with and influenced by German Baptists J. G. Oncken and August Liebig.

The Mennonite Brethren movement spread throughout the Mennonite colonies and produced many distinguished leaders, particularly in Molotschna. These include P. M. Friesen (educator and historian), Jakob and Abraham Kroeker (writers), Heinrich Braun (publisher), Peter Braun (educator) and A. H. Unruh (educator). Jakob Kroeker (1872–1948) was one of the most prolific Mennonite writers, completing a fourteen volume Old Testament commentary. By breaking religious and cultural patterns that had become a hindrance to Mennonite society, the contribution of the Mennonite Brethren allowed all Mennonite groups in Russia to pursue a more wholesome Christian life.

The Mennonite Brethren movement also spread through missionary endeavor. They commissioned the first missionaries to travel from Southern Russia (Ukraine) to India in 1887, establishing congregations in the Hyderabad, Telangana State, region. In the ensuing years, Mennonite Brethren churches have been established in SE Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America.

Because of growing pressure by the Czarist government and later because of the political turmoil of the Russian Revolution, significant numbers of the Mennonite Brethren moved to the United States, Canada, Paraguay, Brazil and Mexico. In the Soviet Union their organizational structures ceased to exist by 1930 due to Communist persecution. At that time some remaining Mennonite Brethren moved from Ukraine to the republics of Soviet Central Asia. After World War II several Mennonite Brethren churches emerged in that region. In 1966 they joined the Evangelical-Baptist Union—an umbrella organization tightly controlled by the Soviet government.

<doc id="458734" wikidata="Q192126" url="?curid=458734" title="Devoll District">
<text>Devoll District() was one of the thirty-six districts of Albania (which were dissolved in 2000) that is now part of Korçë County. It derives its name from the Devoll river flowing through the valley. It had a population of 33,785, and an area of 429 km². It is in the southeastern corner of the country, and its capital is Bilisht. Its busy border point Kapshticë/Krystallopigi connects the district with the Greek regional units of Florina and Kastoria to the east and southeast. Devoll borders the district of Kolonjë to the southwest and Korçë to the west and north. Devoll is also considered a traditional or &quot;ethnographic&quot; region with borders similar to the former district. 

==History==
Excavations at Tren cave unearthed Mycenaean Greek pottery of the Late Bronze Age. This appears to be of possible local manufacture.

The district is known in history for the Devol fortress, where the Treaty of Devol between Bohemond I of Antioch and Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos was held in 1108. Its site became forgotten in modern times, however it has been tentatively identified with the site Zvezdë (located at ), a conjecture already proposed by the 19th century British traveller William Martin Leake in 1835.

It was in Devoll, while the region was within the Serbian Empire, that Emperor Stefan Dušan died in 1355.

In late Ottoman times and early Independence era, much of the Christian population emigrated abroad and then returned, and later a part of the Muslim population did the same. Today, there is again mass emigration, although this time the local Muslim population is emigrating in larger numbers and higher proportions than the Christian population, a reverse of the &quot;Kurbet&quot; of the previous century.

==Population== 
The population is overwhelmingly ethnically Albanian, with the majority of Albanians there having been Muslim (many of these belonging to the Halveti Order) at the end of the Ottoman era, while a minority of the Albanians, especially those that resided especially in high altitude areas, remained Orthodox Christian. The Albanian Christian population lives mostly in the upper valley of the Devoll river, in the town of Hoçisht, in Bilisht and in the village of Tren, and insist on being called only Albanian and not Greek. Additionally, a part of the original post-Ottoman Albanian Muslim population has converted to Orthodoxy as part of emigration to Greece. There are also Roma present as well as Slavic Macedonian speakers in the village of Vërnik. The Slavs of Vernik identify as Aegean Macedonians and refuse any Bulgarian or other identity, however their Albanian neighbors often casually refer to them as &quot;bullgare&quot; (Bulgarians). The Roma are mainly Muslim while the Macedonian Slavs are Orthodox Christians. In modern times, among the Albanian population, there has been extensive intermarriage between the Muslim and Christian populations, with the result being that many of the ethnically Albanian youth in the area identity with both traditions, as &quot;half-Muslim, half-Christian&quot;. Like elsewhere in Albania, actual religious observance is typically lax although due to Ottoman history even among some non-practicers, religious identity may still plays a role in social relations, being more significant among the older generations. 

The Albanian population speaks with a Tosk dialect, while the Macedonian Slavic population speaks the Kostur dialect. The entire Slavic Macedonian population is also bilingual in Albanian nowadays.

<text>The Martin B-26 Marauder is an American twin-engined medium bomber that saw extensive service during World War II. The B-26 was built at two locations: Baltimore, Maryland, and Omaha, Nebraska, by the Glenn L. Martin Company.

First used in the Pacific Theater of World War II in early 1942, it was also used in the Mediterranean Theater and in Western Europe.

After entering service with the United States Army aviation units, the aircraft quickly received the reputation of a &quot;widowmaker&quot; due to the early models&#x27; high accident rate during takeoffs and landings. This was because the Marauder had to be flown at precise airspeeds, particularly on final runway approach or when one engine was out. The unusually high 150 mph (241 km/h) speed on short final runway approach was intimidating to many pilots who were used to much slower approach speeds, and when they slowed to speeds below those stipulated in the manual, the aircraft would often stall and crash.

The B-26 became a safer aircraft once crews were retrained, and after aerodynamics modifications (an increase of wingspan and wing angle-of-incidence to give better takeoff performance, and a larger vertical stabilizer and rudder). The Marauder ended World War II with the lowest loss rate of any U.S. Army Air Forces bomber.

In total, 5,288 were produced between February 1941 and March 1945; 522 of these were flown by the Royal Air Force and the South African Air Force. By the time the United States Air Force was created as an independent military service separate from the United States Army in 1947, all Martin B-26s had been retired from U.S. service. After the Marauder was retired, the unrelated Douglas A-26 Invader then assumed the &quot;B-26&quot; designation, which led to confusion between the two aircraft.

==Design and development==
In March 1939, the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) issued Circular Proposal 39-640, a specification for a twin-engined medium bomber with a maximum speed of , a range of , and a bomb load of . On 5 July 1939, the Glenn L. Martin Company submitted its design, produced by a team led by Peyton M. Magruder, to meet the requirement, the Martin Model 179. Martin&#x27;s design was evaluated as superior to the other proposals and was awarded a contract for 201 aircraft, to be designated B-26. The B-26 went from paper concept to an operational bomber in roughly two years. Additional orders for a further 930 B-26s followed in September 1940, still prior to the first flight of the type.
The B-26 was a shoulder-winged monoplane of all-metal construction, fitted with a tricycle landing gear. It had a streamlined, circular-section fuselage housing the crew, consisting of a bombardier in the nose, armed with a machine gun, a pilot and co-pilot sitting side by side, with positions for the radio operator and navigator behind the pilots. A gunner manned a dorsal turret armed with two machine guns (the first powered dorsal turret to be fitted to a U.S. bomber), and an additional machine gun was fitted in the tail.

Two bomb bays were fitted midfuselage, capable of carrying of bombs, although in practice, such a bomb load reduced range too much, and the aft bomb bay was usually fitted with additional fuel tanks instead of bombs. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp radial engines in nacelles slung under the wing, driving four-bladed propellers. The engines were manufactured at the Ford Dearborn Engine plant in Dearborn, Michigan. The wings were of low aspect ratio and relatively small in area for an aircraft of its weight, giving the required high performance, but also resulting in a wing loading of for the initial versions, which at the time was the highest of any aircraft accepted for service by the USAAC, until the introduction of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, with the then-astonishing wing loading of (although both would be considered lightly loaded by the standard of combat aircraft of the next decade).

The first B-26, with Martin test pilot William K. &quot;Ken&quot; Ebel at the controls, flew on 25 November 1940 and was effectively the prototype. Deliveries to the USAAC began in February 1941 with the second aircraft, &quot;40-1362&quot;. In March 1941, the USAAC started accelerated service testing of the B-26 at Patterson Field, near Dayton, Ohio.

===Accidents===

The B-26&#x27;s relatively small wing area and resulting high wing loading required a high landing speed of indicated airspeed depending on load. At least two of the earliest B-26s suffered hard landings and damage to the main landing gear, engine mounts, propellers, and fuselage. The type was grounded briefly in April 1941 to investigate the landing difficulties. Two causes were found: insufficient landing speed (producing a stall) and improper weight distribution. The latter was due to the lack of a dorsal turret; the Martin power turret was not yet ready.

Some of the very earliest B-26s suffered collapses of the nose landing gear, said to be caused by improper weight distribution, but that is not likely to have been the only reason. The incidents occurred during low-speed taxiing, takeoffs and landings, and occasionally the strut unlocked. Later, the Martin electric dorsal turret was retrofitted to some of the first B-26s. Martin also began testing a taller vertical stabilizer and revised tail gunner&#x27;s position in 1941.

The Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800-5 engines were reliable, but the Curtiss electric pitch-change mechanism in the propellers required impeccable maintenance, not always attainable in the field. Human error and some failures of the mechanism occasionally placed the propeller blades in flat pitch, resulting in an overspeeding propeller, sometimes known as a &quot;runaway prop&quot;. Due to its sound and the possibility that the propeller blades could disintegrate, this situation was particularly frightening for aircrews. More challenging was a loss of power in one engine during takeoff. These and other malfunctions, as well as human error, claimed a number of aircraft and the commanding officer of the 22nd Bombardment Group, Colonel Mark Lewis.

The Martin B-26 suffered only two fatal accidents during its first year of flight, from November 1940 to November 1941—a crash shortly after takeoff near Martin&#x27;s Middle River plant in Maryland (cause unknown, but engine malfunction strongly suggested) and the loss of a 38th Bombardment Group B-26 when its vertical stabilizer and rudder separated from the aircraft at altitude (cause unknown, but the accident report discussed the possibility that a canopy hatch broke off and struck the vertical stabilizer).

As pilots were trained quickly for the war, relatively inexperienced pilots entered the cockpit and the accident rate increased. This occurred at the same time as more experienced B-26 pilots of the 22nd, 38th, and 42nd Bombardment Groups were proving the merits of the bomber.

For a time in 1942, pilots in training believed that the B-26 could not be flown on one engine. This was disproved by several experienced pilots, including Colonel Jimmy Doolittle, who flew demonstration flights at MacDill Army Air Field, which featured takeoffs and landings with only one engine. Also, 17 Women Airforce Service Pilots were trained to demonstrate the B-26, in an attempt to &quot;shame&quot; male pilots into the air.

In 1942, aviation pioneer and company founder Glenn L. Martin was called before the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program, (or also known as the &quot;Truman Committee&quot;), which was investigating defense contracting abuses. Senator Harry S Truman of Missouri, the committee chairman (and future Vice President and 33rd President of the United States in 1945–1953), asked Martin why the B-26 had problems. Martin responded that the wings were too short. Senator Truman curtly asked why the wings had not been changed. When Martin replied that the plans were too close to completion, and his company already had the contract, Truman&#x27;s testy response was quick and to the point: In that case, the contract would be canceled. Martin corrected the wings. (By February 1943, the newest model aircraft, the B-26B-10, had an additional of wingspan, plus uprated engines, more armor, and larger guns.)

Indeed, the regularity of crashes by pilots training at MacDill Field—up to 15 in one 30-day period—led to the exaggerated catchphrase, &quot;One a day in Tampa Bay&quot;. Apart from accidents occurring over land, 13 Marauders ditched in Tampa Bay in the 14 months between 5 August 1942 and 8 October 1943.

B-26 crews gave the aircraft the nickname &quot;Widowmaker&quot;. Other colorful nicknames included &quot;Martin Murderer&quot;, &quot;Flying Coffin&quot;, &quot;B-Dash-Crash&quot;, &quot;Flying Prostitute&quot; (so-named because it was so fast and had &quot;no visible means of support&quot;, referring to its small wings) and &quot;Baltimore Whore&quot; (a reference to the city where Martin was based).

According to an article in the April 2009 edition of &quot;AOPA Pilot&quot; on Kermit Weeks&#x27; &quot;Fantasy of Flight&quot;, the Marauder had a tendency to &quot;hunt&quot; in yaw. This instability is similar to &quot;Dutch roll&quot;. This would make for a very uncomfortable ride, especially for the tail gunner.

The B-26 is stated by the 9th Air Force to have had the lowest combat loss rate of any US aircraft used during the war. Nevertheless, it remained a challenging aircraft to fly and continued to be disliked by some of its pilots throughout its military career. In 1944, in answer to many pilots complaining to the press and their relatives back home, the USAAF and Martin took the unusual step during war of commissioning large articles to be placed in various popular publications to educate the public and defend the flying/accident record of the B-26 against &quot;slanders&quot;. One of the longest of these articles was in the May 1944 issue of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;.

==Operational history==
The B-26 Marauder was used mostly in Europe, but also saw action in the Mediterranean and the Pacific. In early combat, the aircraft took heavy losses, but was still one of the most successful medium-range bombers used by the USAAF. The B-26 was initially deployed on combat missions in the South West Pacific in early 1942, but most of the B-26s subsequently assigned to operational theaters were sent to England and the Mediterranean area.

By the end of World War II, it had flown more than 110,000 sorties, dropped 150,000 tons (136,078 tonnes) of bombs, and had been used in combat by British, Free French, and South African forces in addition to US units. In 1945, when B-26 production was halted, 5,266 had been built.

===Pacific Theater===
The B-26 began to equip the 22nd Bombardment Group at Langley Field, Virginia, in February 1941, replacing the Douglas B-18 Bolo, with a further two groups, the 38th and 28th, beginning to equip with the B-26 by December 1941. Immediately following the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, the 22nd BG was deployed to the South West Pacific, first by ship to Hawaii, then its air echelon flew the planes to Australia. The 22nd BG flew its first combat mission, an attack on Rabaul, which required an intermediate stop at Port Moresby, New Guinea, on 5 April 1942.

A second group, the 38th, began receiving B-26s in November 1941 and began transitioning into them at Patterson Field, Ohio. There, the 38th continued the testing of the B-26, including its range and fuel efficiency. Immediately after the entry of the United States into World War II, plans were tentatively developed to send the 38th BG to the South West Pacific and to equip it with B-26Bs fitted with more auxiliary fuel tanks and provisions for carrying aerial torpedoes. Three 38th BG B-26Bs were detached to Midway Island in the buildup to the Battle of Midway, and two of them, along with two B-26s detached from the 22nd BG, carried out torpedo attacks against the Japanese Fleet on 4 June 1942. Two were shot down and the other two were so badly damaged that they were written off after the mission. Their torpedoes failed to hit any Japanese ships, although they did shoot down one Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter and killed two seamen aboard the aircraft carrier &quot;Akagi&quot; with machine-gun fire. The crew of one B-26, &quot;Susie Q&quot;, after dropping their torpedo, were pursued by fighters; seeking an escape route, they flew directly along the length of the &quot;Akagi&quot;, braving antiaircraft fire – to the point the pursuing Japanese fighters had to hold fire temporarily, to avoid hitting the flagship. Another B-26, seriously damaged by antiaircraft fire, did not pull out of its run, and instead flew directly at &quot;Akagi&quot;″s bridge. Either attempting a suicide ramming, or out of control, the plane narrowly missed striking the carrier&#x27;s bridge, and crashed into the ocean.

From around June 1942, B-26 squadrons of the 38th BG were based in New Caledonia and Fiji. From New Caledonia, missions were flown against Japanese bases in the Solomon Islands. On one occasion, a B-26 was credited with shooting down a Kawanishi H6K flying boat. In 1943, the B-26 was decided to be phased out of operations in the South West Pacific Theater in favor of the North American B-25 Mitchell. Nevertheless, the 19th Bombardment Squadron of the 22nd BG continued to fly missions in the B-26. The B-26 flew its last combat mission in the theater on 9 January 1944.

Two more squadrons of torpedo-armed B-26s equipped the 28th Composite Group and were used for antishipping operations in the Aleutian Islands Campaign, but no records of any successful torpedo attack by a USAAF B-26 have been found.

Comedian George Gobel famously joked about being an instructor for this aircraft at Frederick Army Airfield (now Frederick Regional Airport) during the Pacific battles, boasting, &quot;not one Japanese aircraft got past Tulsa&quot;.

===Mediterranean Theater===
Three bombardment groups were allocated to support the Allied invasion of French North Africa in November 1942. They were initially used to carry out low-level attacks against heavily defended targets, incurring heavy losses with poor results, before switching to medium-level attacks. By the end of the North African Campaign, the three B-26 groups had flown 1,587 sorties, losing 80 aircraft. This was double the loss rate of the B-25, which also flew 70% more sorties with fewer aircraft. Despite this, the B-26 continued in service with the Twelfth Air Force, supporting the Allied advance through Sicily, Italy, and southern France. Air Marshal Sir John Slessor, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, wrote of &quot;the astonishing accuracy of the experienced medium bomber groups—particularly the Marauders; I think that the 42nd Bombardment Group in Sardinia is probably the best day-bomber unit in the world.&quot; Slessor in fact meant the 42nd Bomb Wing—17th, 319th, and 320th Bomb Groups—but a US &#x27;wing&#x27; equated roughly to a British &#x27;group&#x27;, and vice versa.

===Northwest Europe===
The B-26 entered service with the Eighth Air Force in England in early 1943, with the 322nd Bombardment Group flying its first missions in May 1943. Operations were similar to those flown in North Africa with B-26s flying at low level and were unsuccessful. The second mission, an unescorted attack on a power station at IJmuiden, the Netherlands, resulted in the loss of the entire attacking force of 11 B-26s to antiaircraft fire and Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters. Following this disaster, the UK-based B-26 force was switched to medium-altitude operations, and transferred to the Ninth Air Force, set up to support the planned invasion of France.

Bombing from medium altitudes of and with appropriate fighter escort, the Marauder proved far more successful, striking against a variety of targets, including bridges and V-1 launching sites in the buildup to D-Day, and moving to bases in France as they became available. The Marauder, operating from medium altitude, proved to be a highly accurate aircraft, with the 9th Air Force rating it the most accurate bomber available in the final month of the war in Europe. Loss rates were far lower than in the early, low-level days, with the B-26 stated by the 9th Air Force as having the lowest loss rate in the European Theater of Operations at less than 0.5%. On 9 August 1944, Captain Darrell R. Lindsey of the 394th Bombardment Group led a formation of B-26 bombers to destroy the L&#x27;Isle Adam bridge in German-occupied France. Despite his B-26 being heavily damaged by ground fire and engulfed in flames, he completed the bombing run. Lindsey ordered his crew to parachute to safety, but refused to escape himself, ensuring their survival. Moments after the last crew member jumped, the plane exploded, killing Lindsey. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism.

The B-26 flew its last combat missions against the German garrison at the Île d&#x27;Oléron on 1 May 1945, with the last units disbanding in early 1946.

===British Commonwealth===
In 1942, a batch of 52 B-26A Marauders (designated Marauder I by the RAF) were offered to the United Kingdom under Lend-Lease. Like the earlier Martin Maryland and Baltimore, these aircraft were sent to the Mediterranean, replacing the Bristol Blenheims of 14 Squadron in Egypt. The squadron flew its first operational mission on 6 November 1942, being used for long-range reconnaissance, mine-laying and anti-shipping strikes. Unlike the USAAF, 14 Squadron used the equipment for carrying torpedoes, sinking several merchant ships with this weapon. The Marauder also proved useful in disrupting enemy air transport, shooting down considerable numbers of German and Italian transport aircraft flying between Italy and North Africa.

In 1943, deliveries of 100 long-wingspan B-26C-30s (Marauder II) allowed two squadrons of the South African Air Force, 12 Squadron and 24 Squadron to be equipped, these being used for bombing missions over the Aegean Sea, Crete, and Italy. A further 350 B-26Fs and Gs were supplied in 1944, with two more South African squadrons (21 and 30) joining No 12 and 24 in Italy to form an all-Marauder equipped wing, while one further SAAF squadron (25 Squadron) and the new RAF 39 Squadron, re-equipped with Marauders as part of the Balkan Air Force supporting Tito&#x27;s Partisans in Yugoslavia. A Marauder of 25 Squadron SAAF, shot down on the unit&#x27;s last mission of World War II on 4 May 1945, was the last Marauder lost in action. The British and South African aircraft were quickly scrapped following the end of the war, the United States not wanting the return of the Lend-Lease aircraft.

===France===
Following Operation Torch, (the Allied invasion of North Africa), the Free French Air Force re-equipped three squadrons with Marauders for medium-bombing operations in Italy and the Allied invasion of southern France. These B-26s replaced Lioré et Olivier LeO 451s and Douglas DB-7s. Toward the end of the war, seven of the nine French &quot;Groupes de Bombardement&quot; used the Marauder, taking part in 270 missions with 4,884 aircraft sorties in combat. Free French B-26 groups were disbanded in June 1945. Replaced in squadron service by 1947, two lingered on as testbeds for the Snecma Atar jet engine, one of these remaining in use until 1958.

===Corporate operations===

In the immediate postwar years, a few Marauders were converted as high-speed executive transports, accommodating up to 15 passengers. The specifications of the individual conversions differed considerably. The example shown in the image was completed in 1948 and had streamlined nose and tail fairings and windows inserted in the rear fuselage. It served United Airlines before being sold to Mexico. It was purchased by the Confederate Air Force and restored to wartime markings for air-display purposes before being lost in a fatal crash in 1995.

==Variants==

* B-26 — The first 201 planes were ordered based upon design alone. Prototypes were not characterized with the usual &quot;X&quot; or &quot;Y&quot; designations. They had Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800-5 engines. Armament consisted of two .30 caliber and two .50 caliber machine guns. (The last model was armed with nearly three times that number.) The approximate cost then was $80,226.80 per aircraft (201 built).
* B-26A — This incorporated changes made on the production line to the B-26, including upgrading the two .30 caliber machine guns in the nose and tail to .50 caliber. In total, 52 B-26As were delivered to the Royal Air Force, which were used as the Marauder Mk I. The approximate cost then was $102,659.33 per aircraft (139 built).
* B-26B — This model had further improvements on the B-26A, including revised tail gunner&#x27;s glazing. Nineteen were delivered to the Royal Air Force as the Marauder Mk.IA. Production blocks of the 1,883 aircraft built:
** AT-23A or TB-26B—208 B-26Bs converted into target tugs and gunnery trainers designated JM-1 by the US Navy
** B-26B—Single tail gun replaced with twin guns; belly-mounted &quot;tunnel gun&quot; added (81 built)
** B-26B-1—Improved B-26B. (225 built)
** B-26B-2—Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800-41 radials (96 built)
** B-26B-3—Larger carburetor intakes; upgrade to R-2800-43 radials (28 built)
** B-26B-4—Improved B-26B-3 (211 built)
** B-26B-10 through B-26B-55 — Beginning with block 10, the wingspan was increased from and flaps were added outboard of the engine nacelle to improve handling problems during landing caused by high wing loads. The vertical stabilizer height was increased from to . Armament was increased from six to twelve .50 caliber machine guns; this was done in the forward section so that the B-26 could perform strafing missions. The tail gun was upgraded from manual to power operated. Armor was added to protect the pilot and copilot; 1,242 were built.
** CB-26B—12 B-26Bs were converted into transport aircraft (all were delivered to the US Marine Corps for use in the Philippines).
* B-26C—This designation was assigned to those B-26Bs built in Omaha, Nebraska, instead of Baltimore, Maryland. Although nominally the B-26B-10 was the first variant to receive the longer wing, it was actually installed on B-26Cs before the B-26B-10, both being in production simultaneously. A total of 123 B-26Cs was used by the RAF and SAAF as the Marauder Mk II. The approximate cost then was $138,551.27 per aircraft (1,210 built).
** TB-26C—Originally designated as AT-23B; this was a trainer modification of the B-26C (about 300 modified).
* XB-26D—This modified B-26 was used to test hot-air deicing equipment, in which heat exchangers transferred heat from engine exhaust to air circulated to the leading and trailing edges of the wing and empennage surfaces. This system, while promising, was not incorporated into any production aircraft made during World War II. (One converted)
* B-26E—This modified B-26B was constructed to test the effectiveness of moving the dorsal gun turret from the aft fuselage to just behind the cockpit. The offensive and defensive abilities of the B-26E were tested in combat simulations against normal aircraft. Although the tests showed that gains were made with the new arrangement, they were insignificant. A cost analysis concluded that the benefit did not justify the effort needed to convert production lines for the new turret position (one converted).
* B-26F—Angle-of-incidence of wings was increased by 3.5º; the fixed .50 caliber machine gun in the nose was removed; the tail turret and associated armor were improved. The first B-26F was produced in February 1944. One hundred of these were B-26F-1-MAs. Starting with 42-96231, a revised oil cooler was added, along with wing bottom panels redesigned for easier removal. In total, 200 of the 300 aircraft were B-26F-2s and F-6s, all of which were used by the RAF and SAAF as the Marauder Mk III. The F-2 had the Bell M-6 power turret replaced by an M-6A with a flexible canvas cover over the guns. The T-1 bombsight was installed instead of the M-series sight. British bomb fusing and radio equipment were provided (300 built).

<doc id="458752" wikidata="Q627039" url="?curid=458752" title="Mitre Corporation">
<text>The Mitre Corporation (stylized as The MITRE Corporation and MITRE) is an American not-for-profit organization with dual headquarters in Bedford, Massachusetts, and McLean, Virginia. It manages federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) supporting various U.S. government agencies in the aviation, defense, healthcare, homeland security, and cybersecurity fields, among others.

MITRE formed in 1958 as a military think tank, spun out from the radar and computer research at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Over the years, MITRE&#x27;s field of study had greatly diversified. In the 1990s, with the winding down of the Cold War, private companies complained that MITRE had an unfair advantage competing for civilian contracts; in 1996 this led to the civilian projects being spun off to a new company, Mitretek. Mitretek was renamed Noblis in 2007.

== Etymology==
The name MITRE was created by James McCormack Jr., one of the original board members. The name is not an acronym, although various claims that it is can be found online. Originally always seen in upper case, MITRE began using normal capitalization around the time of the Mitretek spinoff, but both forms can still be widely found .

==History==

MITRE was founded in Bedford, Massachusetts in 1958, spun off from the MIT Lincoln Laboratory. MITRE&#x27;s first employees had been developing the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system and aerospace defense as part of Lincoln Labs Division 6. They were specifically engaged in MIT&#x27;s research and engineering of the project.

MITRE&#x27;s early leadership has been described as &quot;a mix of men&quot; affiliated with the Ford Foundation, the Institute for Defense Analyses, RAND Corporation, System Development Corporation (SDC), and the United States Armed Forces, including Horace Rowan Gaither, James Rhyne Killian, James McCormack, and Julius Adams Stratton.

In April 1959, a site was purchased in Bedford, Massachusetts, near Hanscom Air Force Base, to develop a new MITRE laboratory, which MITRE occupied in September 1959. MITRE established an office in McLean in 1963, and had approximately 850 technical employees by 1967. MITRE registered the first .org domain on July 10, 1985, which continues to be used by the company. During the 1980s, the German hacker Markus Hess used an unsecured Mitre Tymnet connection as an entry point for intrusions into U.S. Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and NASA computer networks. By 1989, the company had thousands of employees in Bedford and McLean; approximately 3,000 employees in the &quot;command, control, communications and intelligence&quot; (&quot;C3I&quot;) division oversaw military projects, while non-military projects were handled by the civilian METREK division, which had approximately 800 employees based in McLean.

In 1966, MITRE was one to the first companies to be part of the Dollars for Scholars program. At the beginning the students would go door-to-door for donations, then in 1985 it became a Phone-a-thon. MITRE hosted the Phone-a-thon from 1996 until 2020, where it then in 2021 and 2022 due to COVID-19 became a Mail-a-thon.

By the 1990s, MITRE had become a &quot;multifaceted engineering company with a wide range of clients,&quot; according to Kathleen Day of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. MITRE worked on neural network software, the long-distance telecommunications service FTS2000 for the General Services Administration, and a new computer system for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. On January 29, 1996, Mitre divided into two entities: The MITRE Corporation, to focus on its FFRDCs for DoD and FAA; and a new company established in McLean, called Mitretek Systems until 2007 and now called Noblis, to assume non-FFRDC research work for other U.S. Government agencies.

==Organization==
MITRE restructured its research and engineering operations in mid 2020, forming MITRE Labs. Approximately half of MITRE&#x27;s employees work under the unit, which seeks to &quot;further extend the parent organization&#x27;s impact across federally-funded research-and-development centers and with partners in academia and industry&quot;.

The nonprofit foundation MITRE Engenuity (or simply Engenuity) was launched in 2019 &quot;to collaborate with the private sector on solving industrywide problems with cyber defense&quot; in collaboration with corporate partners. The foundation created the Center for Threat-Informed Defense that has 23 member organizations with cybersecurity teams, as of 2020, including Fujitsu and Microsoft. In September 2020, Engenuity&#x27;s Center for Threat-Informed Defense and partners launched the Adversary Emulation Library, a GitHub-hosted project providing downloadable emulation plans to network security groups at no cost. The library&#x27;s first plan was focused on the prominent cybercrime group FIN6. MITRE had previously released emulation plans for the Chinese and Russian hacker groups Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 3 and APT29 in 2017 and 2020, respectively. In March 2021, Engenuity created the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Defender training program to educate and certify cybersecurity professionals.

=== Federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) ===
MITRE manages six FFRDCs. The National Security Engineering Center, previously known as the C3I Federally Funded Research and Development Center until 2011, addresses national security issues for the Department of Defense.

MITRE&#x27;s Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) supports the FAA, an agency within the Department of Transportation.

The organization&#x27;s Center for Enterprise Modernization, which focuses on enterprise modernization, was established as the IRS Federally Funded Research and Development Center in 1998, before being renamed in August 2001. Originally sponsored by the Internal Revenue Service (a bureau of the Department of the Treasury), the Department of Veterans Affairs joined as a co-sponsor in 2008, and the Social Security Administration joined as a co-sponsor in 2018.

MITRE&#x27;s Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute (HSSEDI) completes work for the Department of Homeland Security, such as maintaining the federal executive department&#x27;s list of the 25 most common software bugs. The HSSEDI was established in 2009, following passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and along with the Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute replaced the Homeland Security Institute.

MITRE&#x27;s CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare was established in 2012 as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Federally Funded Research and Development Center, also known as the Health FFRDC. The FFRDC is sponsored by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services.

MITRE has managed the National Cybersecurity FFRDC since 2014, following receipt of a &quot;single indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity&quot; $5 billion contract from the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) for a research center dedicated to cybersecurity. MITRE will support NIST&#x27;s work &quot;related to cybersecurity solutions composed of commercial components and the integration of technology to build trustworthy information systems for government agencies&quot;.

Currently, MITRE holds the contract to administer and provide management to JASON, an advisory group for the federal government made up of scientists.

=== Policy ===
MITRE&#x27;s Center for Data-Driven Policy, established in 2020, seeks to &quot;provide evidence-based, objective and nonpartisan insights for government policymaking&quot;.

The Center for Technology &amp; National Security, now part of the Center for Data-Driven Policy, was created to link MITRE &quot;with senior government officials for research and development purposes&quot;. Members of the advisory board include John F. Campbell, Lisa Disbrow, William E. Gortney, Robert B. Murrett, and Robert O. Work, as of mid 2020.

== Projects ==

=== National security ===
U.S. military forces, especially the Air Force, were primary initial sponsors; according to &quot;Air Force Magazine&quot;, MITRE was created &quot;as a special-purpose technical not-for-profit firm to perform the SAGE systems-engineering job&quot;. The aerial warfare service branch had struggled to identify a for-profit corporation to develop the defense system, so MITRE was hired to serve as the system engineer. MITRE subsequently designed air defense systems for the U.S. and allies, improving aircraft and missile tracking as well as communication interception abilities. The company also helped design the Cheyenne Mountain Complex facility in Colorado operating the North American Air Defense system. In the 1970s, MITRE continued supporting military projects such as AWACS and the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System and &quot;[helping] civil agencies develop information systems for transportation, medicine, law enforcement, space exploration and environmental cleanup.&quot;

MITRE has completed software engineering work for the Distributed Common Ground System and helped the North Atlantic Treaty Organization create intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) data standards. The company also worked with the Multi-Sensor Aerospace-Ground Joint ISR Interoperability Coalition to ensure proper formatting for ISR sensor data. In 2018, MITRE developed the &quot;Deliver Uncompromised&quot; strategy for the Department of Defense, proposing recommendations for supply chain security. MITRE and the Air Force Association&#x27;s Mitchell Institute published a report in 2019 recommending improved technologies for the U.S. nuclear command, control and communications (NC3) network and warning that some of the system&#x27;s early satellites are &quot;vulnerable to electronic attacks and interference&quot;. The firm also published a government-mandated report with recommendations for the Air Force&#x27;s inventory in 2030. The Department of Veterans Affairs hired MITRE to provide recommendation for implementation and program integration of the Forever GI Bill.

MITRE has also focused on the great power competition; in 2020, the company published a paper about 5G networks and competition between China and the U.S.

=== Airspace, Global Positioning System (GPS), and aerospace ===
In addition to military work, MITRE&#x27;s early projects included air traffic control improvements for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). During the 1980s, MITRE helped modernize the Air Force&#x27;s airborne early warning and control system and improve the Milstar constellation of communications satellites. The company also worked on a major overhaul of the FAA&#x27;s traffic control system as well as sensor technology for tracking stealth aircraft. In 1997, MITRE sponsored a research program related to Global Positioning System (GPS) adaptive nulling antennas. MITRE also provided global navigation satellite system signal generation equipment for testing at the United States Army&#x27;s White Sands Missile Range. The Air Force Research Laboratory&#x27;s geosynchronous satellite Navigation Technology Satellite-3 will use MITRE&#x27;s Global Navigation Satellite System Test Architecture to &quot;implement user equipment capability&quot;.

MITRE has worked on the traffic collision avoidance system of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), a modernization project of the National Airspace System (NAS). MITRE&#x27;s Integrated Demonstration and Experimentation for Aeronautics (IDEA) Lab has assessed the impact of new technologies for the FAA since 1992. In addition to air traffic management and aviation regulations, the group has worked on merging unmanned aerial vehicle operations into the NAS as well as defining how the system will function in 2035, a decade after the scheduled implementation of NextGen.

MITRE has explored the use of mobile devices for communicating instrument flight rules, specifically clearances at airports lacking Pre-Departure Clearance/Data Comm Clearance. The company&#x27;s Pacer web application uses System Wide Information Management and Traffic Flow Management System data as well as airline and general aviation departure schedules to &quot;improve the way that general aviation operators file for and obtain departure clearances&quot;.

MITRE has also completed air traffic control and safety work for the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). The company&#x27;s Singapore-based unit was hired by CAAS to consider how artificial intelligence, machine learning, and speech recognition could be used to improve air traffic management systems. Among MITRE&#x27;s innovations was a &quot;speech recognition prototype that will automate and shorten the transcription process during an aviation incident investigation&quot;.

MITRE and the Naval Research Laboratory developed the Frequency-scaled Ultra-wide Spectrum Element (FUSE) antenna to increase the data transfer speed between ground users and satellites. Meshbed, a CubeSat launched into orbit by the Indian Space Research Organisation&#x27;s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle in November 2019, will test the antenna&#x27;s effectiveness. MITRE has received three patents for the antenna.

=== Cybersecurity and election integrity ===
The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, launched in 2015, has been described by &quot;Computer Weekly&quot; as &quot;the free, globally accessible service that offers comprehensive and current cyber security threat information&quot; to organizations, and by TechTarget as a &quot;global knowledge base of threat activity, techniques and models&quot;. The framework has been used by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI. Version 14.1 was released in October 2023. According to a 2020 study published by the University of California, Berkeley and security software company McAfee, 80 percent of companies use the framework for cybersecurity.

The Structured Threat Information eXchange (STIX), described as a &quot;machine-to-machine cyber threat information-sharing language&quot;, was developed by MITRE and the Department of Homeland Security. The program facilitates information sharing between industry, critical infrastructure operators and government in order to blunt cyberattacks&quot; and allows participants to share data via the Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII). Program governance was granted to the global nonprofit consortium OASIS in 2015, and STIX 2.0 was approved in 2017.

In September 2020, the U.S. Air Force awarded a $463 million contract to continue work for the National Security Engineering Center, an FFRDC supporting the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community. The contract will provide cybersecurity, electronics, information technology, sensors, and systems engineering services in Bedford and McLean for one year. Microsoft and MITRE partnered on the open source Adversarial Machine Learning Threat Matrix in collaboration with IBM, Nvidia, and academic institutions. Launched in October 2020, the framework is &quot;designed to organize and catalogue known techniques for attacks against machine-learning systems, to inform security analysts and provide them with strategies to detect, respond and remediate against threats&quot;.

In February 2020, MITRE launched SQUINT, a free app allowing election officials to report misinformation on social media; the app was being used by eleven U.S. states, as of October 2020. The company also established the National Election Security Lab, offering free risk assessments for voting systems.

Other projects include the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database of vulnerabilities and exposures related to information security and the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) category system for software weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

=== Government innovation ===
MITRE and the British startup company Simudyne partnered to convert an &quot;agent-based&quot; financial risk model of &quot;asset fire-sales and investor flight from banks and funds into a commercial product&quot;. The new system is based on one MITRE had previously created for the Department of the Treasury. MITRE has also researched cloud computing policy, helped the U.S. federal government identify fraudulent comments intended to &quot;spoof&quot; public support for non-existent positions during the rulemaking process, and increased the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue&#x27;s delinquent taxpayer compliance rate.

=== Health care ===
In 1982, Mitre authored a proposal for the State Department called &quot;Cannabis Eradication in Foreign Western Nations.&quot; In this proposal, a plan was outlined to eradicate cannabis in participating nations within 121 days, for $19 million. The report discussed the use and safety considerations of paraquat. The plan would have been to aerially dispense paraquat over marijuana crops. One safety concern was the food crops grown alongside the marijuana crops being contaminated. A study conducted on rats by Imperial Chemical Industries was cited in the report, and claimed low health risks for paraquat. The U.S. Public Health Service commented on this study saying that due to the present squamous metaplasia in the respiratory tracts of the rats that &quot;This study should not be used to calculate the safe inhalation dose of paraquat in humans.&quot;

During the 1980s, MITRE worked on a digital radiological imaging project for MedStar Georgetown University Hospital and an upgrade to MEDLINE for the National Institutes of Health. Synthea, MITRE&#x27;s open source synthetic data system, &quot;mirrors real population information in terms of demographics, disease burden, vaccinations, medical visits and social determinants&quot;, and seeks to &quot;mimic how each patient progresses from birth to death through modular representations of various diseases and conditions&quot;. MITRE&#x27;s patient data set SyntheticMass, based on &quot;fictional&quot; Massachusetts residents, was formatted by Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources and made available to developers via Google Cloud in 2019.

==== COVID-19 ====
In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, MITRE published a white paper claiming the number of confirmed and reported COVID-19 cases &quot;significantly underrepresent the actual number of active domestic COVID-19 infections&quot; in the United States. MITRE said the gap was because of &quot;limited testing capability and the multi-day period of asymptomatic infectivity associated with the COVID-19 pathogen&quot;. MITRE managed the Coronavirus Commission on Safety and Quality in Nursing Homes, announced by the Donald Trump administration in June 2020, to &quot;independently and comprehensively assess&quot; responses to the pandemic and &quot;offer actionable recommendations to inform future responses to infectious disease outbreaks within nursing homes&quot;.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funded a $16.5 million MITRE-led project to create an enduring open source tool called Sara Alert, for monitoring symptoms of Americans exposed to COVID-19. MITRE developed the free tool in collaboration with multiple national public health organizations as well as local and state health agencies. In April 2020, Sara Alert launched in Arkansas and was being tested in Danbury, Connecticut as well as the Northern Mariana Islands, with data being maintained by the Association of Public Health Laboratories. Sara Alert was being used in Idaho, Maine, Pennsylvania, and Virginia by the end of May, and Guam by October. Since January 2021, MITRE has co-lead a coalition known as the Vaccination Credential Initiative (VCI), which is composed of over 300 technology and healthcare organizations developing a technical standard for verifying vaccination and other clinical information.

==Corporate governance==

===Leadership===
Clair William Halligan, an electrical engineer, served as MITRE&#x27;s first president until 1966, when he became chairman of the company&#x27;s executive committee. He retired in 1968. John L. McLucas succeeded Halligan as president. Robert Everett served as president from 1969 to 1986. Subsequent holders of the president and chief executive officer (CEO) role included Charles S. Zraket (1986–1990), Barry Horowitz (1990–1996), Victor A. DeMarines (1996–2000), Martin C. Faga (2000–2006), Alfred Grasso (2006–2017), and Jason Providakes (2017–2024). Mark Peters became the current president and CEO in 2024. 

Jay Schnitzer serves as chief technology officer and chief medical officer. He is leading a national effort to combat COVID-19 on behalf of MITRE and 50 partner companies, health care providers, and researchers, as of March 2020. MITRE named Charles Clancy its first chief futurist in 2020 and restructured to create MITRE Labs.

Current trustees include Rodney E. Slater (chairman), Sue Gordon (vice chair), Richard D. Clarke, Lance Collins, Maury W. Bradsher, Michael Huerta, Chris Inglis, Yvette Meléndez, George Halvorson, Paul G. Kaminski, Adalio T. Sanchez, Cathy Minehan,  and Jan E. Tighe.

== Partnerships ==
The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and MITRE partnered on the &#x27;mCODE Initiative&#x27; to recommend data standards for cancer patients&#x27; electronic health records. MITRE supports the Homeland Security Experts Group, which has been described as &quot;an independent, nonpartisan group of homeland security and counterterrorism experts that educates the public and government leaders, including the secretary of homeland security&quot;.

MITRE became a founding member of the Space Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a cybersecurity project for the space industry, in 2019. MITRE and partners such as Harvard Innovation Labs and MassChallenge launched Bridging Innovation in 2020 to connect government agencies and startup companies. MITRE is a member of the COVID-19 Healthcare Coalition, which is co-chaired by Jay Schnitzer. In June 2020, the coalition launched the COVID-19 Decision Support Dashboard, which uses public data to assess transmission trends and display color-coded indicators based on performance by jurisdiction. MITRE is also part of the Fight Is In Us coalition, a collaborative effort between advocates, companies, and government officials to promote plasma donation for patient treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Challenges ===
MITRE&#x27;s Countering Unmanned Aircraft Systems Challenge in 2016 invited applicants to &quot;demonstrate systems that detect and stop drones weighing less than five pounds that present a safety or security risk&quot;. The company&#x27;s Unique Identification of Internet of Things (IoT) Devices Challenge tasked applicants with improving security for connected devices. In 2020, MITRE participated in the National Institute of Standards and Technology&#x27;s Too Close for Too Long Challenge to &quot;help evaluate and potentially improve upon that baseline Bluetooth performance for helping detect when smartphone users are standing too close to one another&quot;.

== Locations ==
In addition to the headquarter campuses in Bedford and McLean, MITRE has more than 60 other locations throughout the United States and around the world. In New Jersey, two offices house approximately 60 employees, as of September 2020. Up to 70 percent of employees may continue working remotely, even after restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have been lifted.

MITRE&#x27;s data center in Bedford, originally built during the 1980s and known as the High Performance Computing Center since 2015, was retrofitted with a refrigerant-based cooling system, resulting in lower operating costs and a higher compute capacity. In 2023, a large underground marine equipment testing tank opened on the Bedford campus. The company&#x27;s McLean campus houses the Integrated Demonstration and Experimentation for Aeronautics (IDEA) Lab, as well as the Mobile Autonomous Systems Experimentation lab, which focuses on self-driving cars. MITRE&#x27;s laboratory in Singapore, called Mitre Asia Pacific Singapore (MAPS) assesses and displays &quot;various safety and air traffic concepts in preparation for the future&quot;.

==Recognition==
In June 2008, MITRE was presented with the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service for &quot;significant contributions in communications, command and control decision-making, intelligence, cyberspace, and warfighter field support, as well as research and development&quot;.
