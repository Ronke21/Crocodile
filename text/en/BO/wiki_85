<text>The Second Coming is a two-part British television drama first screened on ITV in the United Kingdom in February 2003. It concerns the realisation of humble video store worker Steve Baxter (played by Christopher Eccleston) that he is in fact the Son of God, and has just a few days to find the human race&#x27;s Third Testament and thus avert the Apocalypse.

It was written by Russell T Davies (later head writer of the 2005 series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;), and produced by the independent Red Production Company. The programme was originally commissioned as four one-hour episodes by Channel 4 in 1999; however, when new executives took over running the drama department at that channel, they decided not to pursue the project. Davies and Red&#x27;s founder Nicola Shindler took the project to the BBC, who quickly turned it down; it found a home on ITV, a channel that had gained a reputation for producing mainstream, unchallenging, &quot;middle-of-the-road&quot; drama in recent years.

Screened over two successive evenings in prime time on Sunday and Monday, 9–10 February 2003, &quot;The Second Coming&quot; gained viewing figures of over six million. Davies, who is an atheist, has said his intention was to provoke debate and get people thinking about religion.

==Plot==
Steven Baxter, a good-hearted but slightly awkward video shop worker from Manchester, disappears for forty days and forty nights after a drunken night out with his friends to celebrate his best friend Judy&#x27;s divorce, during which he shared a kiss with her. He is found wandering Saddleworth Moor, and he claims to be the second coming of Jesus. At first he is met with scepticism, and is even locked up. One of the few people who believes him is a young Catholic priest, who mentions an obscure Christian text that mentions that the lamb will be sent to the city of the North, followed by a series of numbers that turned out to be map co-ordinates. The recent death of the Pope is also seen as a sign. Steve escapes and decides to indicate he is really the son of God to humanity by turning night into day over the football stadium at Maine Road, advertising the feat on the internet and attracting the attention of the world&#x27;s media. Steve then announces he must find the &quot;third testament&quot; within five days. He states that humanity needs to start taking responsibility for their actions, and that everyone, regardless of their religion or origin, needs to begin again and forget past conflicts. He also says that Christians should not boast about being right, then reveals that currently heaven is empty, while hell is bursting at the seams. There is much hysteria and panic; particularly when Satan and several demons possess people (only indicated by silver eyes) to cause trouble. Satan takes possession of a man named Johnny Tyler that Judy met through a dating agency. He eventually reveals to Judy he wants Steve to fail and fall into despair, so that after Armageddon God will judge Steve&#x27;s actions as a human and send him to hell, and they can rule together. In a deleted scene, it is revealed Satan also wants God to return to being the merciless, angry God of the Old Testament.

Later, it is revealed that Steve&#x27;s earthly father could not have fathered him as he was born sterile, another indicator that Steve is really the son of God.

There is also media frenzy surrounding the events, especially after a tape is leaked of Steve saying that the world will end if the testament is not found, and he is taken into police protection. Some of Steve&#x27;s friends accept him as the Messiah - Pete (who kept his Christianity hidden, not knowing how his friends would react) and Fiona (who becomes crazed, as this is the first time she has ever believed). Judy, an atheist, remains sceptical. She and Steve have some heated arguments (at one point, in a fit of anger, Steve is tempted to use his godly powers to kill her), especially as despite being the son of God, Steve is neither omniscient (relying on information &quot;downloading&quot; into his head, which frustrates him too) nor omnipotent (he cannot heal the sick). Steve later says that he does have powers, but he refuses to use them as he could get power mad, and reiterates it is up to humanity to sort themselves out this time. Judy is also confronted by several demons and manipulated into situations to get her to believe, which is part of Satan&#x27;s plan to have Steve fall into despair.

During the next few days, Steve miraculously survives several attempts made on his life, including a bomb going off in a pub in which he is drinking. The devil and his demons also attempt to turn his father Frank against him, getting him hooked on drugs and alcohol and convincing him that he is now a joke in the public&#x27;s eyes (one deleted scene saw him watching Bernard Manning on TV making jokes at his expense). Frank tries to shoot Steve, but ends up killing Pete. After her husband leaves her, Fiona attempts suicide and tries to kill her children too. Also during this time Judy and Steve&#x27;s relationship grows deeper, and they have sex.Steve himself has no idea what the third testament will be; he receives too many candidates to figure out which one is the real one. The Chief Superintendent of the police, who is also possessed by a demon, has them thrown out, saying that even if it were there, Steve would not be able to make his broadcast to the world. Having failed to discover the Testament, the people of the world hide inside their homes, fearing that the end of the world is nigh.

Steve then visits Judy in hope of trying to work out what the testament is, and Judy reveals to him that it is the record she is making of events. Judy, who is filmed 24 hours a day by cameras from the world&#x27;s media around her house, makes spaghetti and laces it with rat poison, but announces this to Steve before presenting it to him. She states that it is Judgement Day, but for Steve and God, stating that the existence of God and the mere argument about His existence have both led humanity to do so many bad things to each other. Steve is persuaded by Judy that he must die, and moreover make it permanent (in the sense of ceasing to exist rather than returning to heaven), so that humanity fights for itself rather than relying on the evils of fundamentalism. This will not only be the death of him, but of God, Satan, heaven and hell - the end of all religion. She also says that the absence of any kind of afterlife may scare people into living their lives properly.

Steve does not believe her at first, thinking she was influenced by the demons. He does one last divine &quot;download&quot; and, to his horror, realises that this is indeed the Third Testament, &quot;the closing of the family business.&quot; He is scared at first, but then decides that it is time to die, and he eats his Last Supper. Henceforth, the world goes back to normal, with a few people referring to Judy as &quot;the woman who killed God&quot;, but she otherwise goes back to living an ordinary insignificant life, having married the policeman who guarded her despite everyone else leaving their jobs and posts in fear of the apparent apocalypse. Judy sees Johnny Tyler (who has no memory of being possessed) and asks him if she did the right thing, but he cannot answer – suggesting that the audience needs to decide for itself.

An earlier draft of the script features a twist ending in which Judy is married to Steve, who has simply given up his divinity and become human again, with only her recognising him. However, Davies was advised against ending the story this way by his friend and fellow writer Paul Abbott, who felt that it cheated the audience.

==Production==
Davies originally conceived the idea for the programme while on a car journey from Manchester to Liverpool with his friend, the television producer Tony Wood. His initial pitch to Nicola Shindler described a scene from the second episode, with the Son of God having returned to Earth, made love to the woman he loves and her asking him if he loves her.

The eventual production for ITV was produced by Anne Harrison-Baxter and directed by Adrian Shergold, with Davies and Shindler as executive producers. Davies himself directed some of the second unit material featuring real-life television personalities such as Richard and Judy and Trisha Goddard commenting on Steven Baxter, seen throughout the programme along with news reports featuring real-life newsreaders such as Jon Snow and Krishnan Guru-Murthy. The bulk of filming took place during the summer of 2002.

The change from four one-hour episodes to two ninety-minute instalments necessitated the cutting of much material from what would originally have been episode three, the opening half of the eventual second episode. Most of this material centred around Steve&#x27;s friends and family being tested by the devil&#x27;s servants as well as Steve&#x27;s mother, who in the final edit is removed altogether and referred to only as having died some time beforehand. Some of this material was shot, and the scenes that did not make the programme were included as bonus features on the DVD release of the serial, released the week after the programmes&#x27;s UK broadcast. Also included on the disc was an audio commentary from Davies and Shergold.

The first episode, shown at 9pm on Sunday 9 February gained an average overnight viewing figure of 6.3 million, winning its timeslot ahead of the nearest competition, a documentary on the actor Christopher Reeve on BBC One, which gained 5.5 million, a 21% share. The second episode lost a sixth of its audience, with an average of 5.4 million viewers, beaten by the drama series &quot;In Deep&quot; on BBC One, which gained a figure of 6.6 million.

&quot;The Second Coming&quot; has also been shown in other countries – BBC America broadcast the drama in the United States in late 2003; it has also been seen in Canada on Showcase, in Australia on the ABC, and in New Zealand by TVNZ. Some versions shown overseas are shorter, with certain scenes cut and the ending coming after the &#x27;documentary&#x27; scenes rather than the very final scene in the supermarket car park seen in the UK version.

==Critical reception==
Critical reaction to the production was generally positive. &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper&#x27;s reviewer, Kathryn Flett, said that &quot;the boldness of the subject matter was complemented by a script of considerable depth and humour, and there were performances of Bafta-grabbing brilliance from everybody involved&quot;. She particularly praised the performances of the two leads: &quot;Christopher Eccleston, never knowingly under-intense, was perfectly cast as the Everybloke suddenly gifted with the ability to provide answers to the big questions and perform medium-sized miracles... Sharp, burdened (or perhaps liberated?) by bad hair and make-up for most of the film proved herself yet again to be one of Britain&#x27;s finest actresses.&quot;

In &quot;The Times&quot;, Paul Hoggart&#x27;s verdict on the first episode was that: &quot;It is intelligent, often amusing, and, at times, passionate and provocative. It throws down a gauntlet to religion, especially in tonight&#x27;s conclusion, and something happens at the end which is probably deeply blasphemous... There are some clunks and bumps in the script, but most are smoothed over by excellent acting.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; to preview the drama before it aired, Mark Lawson said that: &quot;Transmuting different genres like wine made from water — comedy into romance into thriller — Eccleston, Sharp, Davies and his director Adrian Shergold have created a world in which it soon ceases to seem odd that God chose Manchester. Steve only knows how they did it, but they have.&quot; Commenting on the US showing on BBC America, &quot;New York Magazine&quot; reviewer John Leonard called it &quot;...an interesting argument about the cost benefits of the possible death of God. Rough, rude, and wonderfully acted.&quot;

&quot;The Second Coming&quot; featured in two major categories at the 2004 British Academy Television Awards, the most important TV awards ceremony in the UK. In the Best Actor category Christopher Eccleston lost out to Bill Nighy (for &quot;State of Play&quot;) while the production itself was beaten by &quot;Charles II: The Power and The Passion&quot; in the Best Drama Serial category.

Delivering the Huw Wheldon Lecture at the Royal Television Society&#x27;s annual convention in Cambridge in September 2005, Paul Abbott praised &quot;The Second Coming&quot; as one of the few genuinely innovative British television drama productions of recent years, describing it as: &quot;...a television masterpiece. It grappled with the most colossal subject matter in the return of a messiah to earth. Not in a Robert Powell way. Modern earth. Manchester, actually. And mainly the scruffy end.&quot;

<doc id="462658" wikidata="Q773742" url="?curid=462658" title="Quintus Ligarius">
<text>Quintus Ligarius (died ) was one of the assassins of Julius Caesar. He had been accused of treason for having opposed Caesar in the civil war in Africa, but was defended so eloquently by Cicero that he was pardoned and allowed to return to Rome. He later conspired with Marcus Junius Brutus, with whom he assassinated Julius Caesar on 15 March 44 BC.

==Civil war== 
Quintus Ligarius was a member of an equestrian Sabine family. He had gone to Africa as legate to the provincial governor Gaius Considius Longus, who when returning to Rome left him in command. After Pompey was defeated by Caesar at the Battle of Pharsalus, Pompey&#x27;s ally Publius Attius Varus went to Africa and there continued the war. Ligarius became one of his assistants. He was present at the Battle of Thapsus. After the defeat, he was captured at Hadrumetum. He was spared by Caesar, but he was not allowed back into Italy.

==Trial==
Ligarius&#x27; brothers asked Cicero to intercede on behalf of their exiled relative. Cicero secured a meeting with Caesar, who seemed receptive, but then an order was made to arrest Ligarius on charges that are no longer clear, but appear to have involved the claim that he conspired with King Juba I. The prosecution seems to have emerged from a grudge held by Quintus Aelius Tubero over an incident when Ligarius denied Tubero&#x27;s family help when he was in charge of Africa.

At the trial, Cicero gave an impassioned speech in Ligarius&#x27; defence, known as the &quot;Pro Ligario&quot;. He ignored the actual charges, but instead made an emotional appeal for reconciliation and clemency, warning of the dangers of vendettas. According to Plutarch, &quot;Caesar was emotionally overcome, his body shook, and some documents fell from his hand. And so under compulsion he acquitted Ligarius&quot;.

==Conspirator==
The acquittal allowed Ligarius to return to Rome. Plutarch writes that he did not forgive Caesar for pardoning him. This hatred, and his friendship with other Liberators, caused him to join the assassination plot. According to Plutarch, Ligarius was ill in bed when he was visited by Marcus Brutus. He told Brutus that he would be made well again by helping him with his plot. Plutarch refers to him as &quot;Caius Ligarius&quot; in the passage, but the context strongly implies that he is referring to the same person who was tried and acquitted.

Although no author specifically identifies Ligarius as a victim of the proscriptions of the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC, there is little doubt he was one of the victims, as Cicero mentions that there were three brothers, and Appian mentions three brothers with this name who perished in the proscriptions.

==In Shakespeare==
Ligarius is a character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. He is called &quot;Caius Ligarius&quot;, which is the name used by Plutarch when describing the episode of his sickness.

He is depicted, following Plutarch, as a sickly man, though strong in mind, with a grudge against Caesar for reprimanding him for admiring Pompey. His absolute trust in Brutus sets up the role of Brutus as a moral model whose leadership is necessary to bring others on board. Though part of the conspiracy, he does not participate in the assassination itself.

<doc id="462661" wikidata="Q610440" url="?curid=462661" title="Karen Berger">
<text>Karen Berger (; born February 26, 1958) is an American comic book editor. She is best known for her role in helping create DC Comics&#x27; Vertigo imprint in 1993 and serving as the line&#x27;s Executive Editor until 2013. She currently oversees Berger Books, an imprint of creator-owned comics being published by Dark Horse Comics.

== Biography ==
Berger majored in English literature and art history at Brooklyn College, and upon her graduation in 1979, she entered the comics profession as an assistant to editor Paul Levitz at DC. She later became Levitz&#x27;s editor when he was writing &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;. More interested in horror comics, she soon became editor of &quot;House of Mystery&quot;, and was instrumental in nurturing Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; book, taking over the editing from co-creator Len Wein. She also edited &quot;Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld&quot;. She later helped bring Neil Gaiman&#x27;s work to a mass audience by having him write &quot;The Sandman&quot;.

The success of these titles, and her willingness to help the writers who worked with her push the envelope of what could be done in mass-circulation comic books, led to the creation of the mature-reader Vertigo line in 1993. Her critically and popularly successful titles under that imprint include &quot;Fables&quot;, &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, &quot;The Invisibles&quot;, &quot;100 Bullets&quot;, &quot;Preacher&quot;, &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

Berger is married to Richard Bruning, who also formerly worked at DC.

In 2007, Berger was named supervising editor (along with Senior Editor Shelly Bond) of Minx, a new comic book imprint published by DC. Minx published comics and graphic novels aimed at teenage girls until they were cancelled in 2008.

On December 3, 2012, she announced that she would be stepping down from her post as Executive Editor &amp; Senior Vice President of DC Entertainment&#x27;s Vertigo imprint and that she would remain on through March 2013 to assist in the transition to a new editorial team.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; profiled Berger and her departure from Vertigo in an article entitled &quot;Comics&#x27; Mother of &#x27;The Weird Stuff&#x27; is Moving On&quot;.

In February 2017, Dark Horse Comics announced that Berger would be overseeing a new line of creator-owned comics published by Dark Horse under the imprint: Berger Books.

Berger Books&#x27; first print publication was &quot;Berger Books Free 2018 Preview&quot;, dated November 2017. Berger Books first full comic was &quot;Hungry Ghosts&quot; #1 (written by Anthony Bourdain and Joel Rose), on sale in comic book shops on January 31, 2018.

<doc id="462662" wikidata="Q2027138" url="?curid=462662" title="Kfar Etzion massacre">
<text>The Kfar Etzion massacre refers to a massacre of Jews that took place after a two-day battle in which Jewish Kibbutz residents and Haganah militia defended Kfar Etzion from a combined force of the Arab Legion and local Arab men on May 13, 1948, the day before the Israeli Declaration of Independence. Of the 127 Haganah fighters and Jewish kibbutzniks who died during the defence of the settlement, Martin Gilbert states that fifteen were killed on surrendering.

Controversy surrounds the responsibility and role of the Arab Legion in the killing of those who surrendered. The official Israeli version maintains that the kibbutz residents and Haganah soldiers were massacred by local Arabs and the Arab Legion of the Jordanian Army as they were surrendering. The Arab Legion version maintains that the Legion arrived too late to prevent the kibbutz attack by men from nearby Arab villages, which was allegedly motivated by a desire to avenge the massacre of Deir Yassin and the destruction of one of their villages several months earlier. The surrendering Jewish residents and fighters are said to have been assembled in a courtyard, only to be suddenly fired upon; it is said that many died on the spot, while most of those who managed to flee were hunted down and killed.

Four prisoners survived the massacre and were transferred to Transjordan. Immediately following the surrender on May 13, the kibbutz was looted and razed to the ground. The members of the three other kibbutzim of the Gush Etzion surrendered the next day and were taken as POWs to Jordan.

The bodies of the victims were left unburied until, one and a half years later, the Jordanian government allowed Shlomo Goren to collect the remains, which were then interred at Mount Herzl. The survivors of the Etzion Bloc were housed in former Arab houses in Jaffa.

==Background==

Kfar Etzion was a kibbutz founded in 1943, for military and agricultural ends, about 2 km west of the road between Jerusalem and Hebron. By the end of 1947, there were 163 adults and 50 children living there. Much of the town&#x27;s population was made up of Holocaust survivors. Together with three nearby kibbutzim established 1945–1947, it formed &quot;Gush Etzion&quot; (&#x27;Etzion Bloc&#x27;). According to one member of the settlement, relations were good between settlers and local Arabs, with attendance at each other&#x27;s weddings, until November 1947.
The United Nations partition plan for Palestine of November 29, 1947, placed the bloc, an enclave in a purely Arab area, inside the boundaries of the intended Arab state, where, moreover, Jewish settlement was to be forbidden through a transitional period. For Hebronite Arabs, the bloc constituted an &#x27;alien intrusion&#x27; on ground that had been wholly Arab for centuries,&#x27; though it had been built on land either purchased by Jews (1928) or acquired by them through a complex circumvention of Mandatory law in 1942. According to Henry Laurens, Kfar Etzion had started hostilities in the area in December by destroying a local Arab village. On 10 December, a convoy from Bethlehem en route to the Gush Etzion bloc was ambushed and 10 of its 26 passengers and escorts were killed. Though on January 5, the children and some women had been evacuated with British assistance, and though David Shaltiel recommended its evacuation, the Haganah, on Yigal Yadin&#x27;s counsel, decided against withdrawing from the settlements for several reasons: they commanded a strategic position on Jerusalem&#x27;s southern approach from Hebron, and were considered, in the words of Abdullah Tall, a &#x27;sharp thorn stuck in the heart of a purely Arab area&#x27;. Several relief convoys from the Haganah in Jerusalem had been ambushed.

In the months prior to May 15, Haganah militiamen in the bloc&#x27;s kibbutzim repeatedly fired on Arab civilians, and British traffic, including convoys, moving between Jerusalem and Hebron, under instruction to do so in order to draw and drain Arab forces from the fight for Jerusalem. On two occasions, April 12 and May 3, Arab Legion units were ambushed, and several legionnaires killed or wounded by the bloc militias, - Kfar Etzion soldiers being directly involved in the incident on April 12 - Arab irregular forces made small-scale attacks against the settlements. An emergency reinforcement convoy attempting to march to Gush Etzion under cover of darkness was discovered and its members killed by Palestinian Arab forces. Despite some emergency flights by an Auster from Jerusalem and Piper Cubs out of Tel Aviv onto an improvised airfield, adequate supplies were not getting in.

As the end of the British Mandate drew closer, the fighting in the region intensified. Although the Arab Legion was theoretically in Palestine under British command, they began to operate more and more independently. On March 27, land communication with the rest of the Yishuv was severed completely when the Nebi Daniel Convoy was ambushed on its return to Jerusalem, and 15 Haganah soldiers died before the remainder were extricated by the British. It was ambushes by the Etzion Bloc militias conducted against Arab Legion units on April 12 and May 4 that, according to a Haganah analysis, tipped the Legion&#x27;s policy towards the bloc from one of isolating it to destroying it. On May 4, following the last ambush of a Legion convoy, a joint force of British, Arab Legion and irregular troops launched a major punitive attack on Kfar Etzion. The Haganah abandoned a few outposts but generally resisted, and the attack failed, leaving 12 Haganah soldiers dead, 30 wounded, with a similar number of Arab legionnaires killed, and several dozen wounded. Units from the bloc may have attacked Arab traffic the following day, but the failure of the Legion&#x27;s assault led Hebronites and Legion units to plan a final attack and destroy the Etzion Bloc militarily.
The final assault on Kfar Etzion began on May 12. Parts of two Arab Legion companies, assisted by hundreds of local irregulars, had a dozen armored cars and artillery, to which the Jewish defenders had no effective answer. The commander of Kfar Etzion requested from the Central Command in Jerusalem permission to evacuate the kibbutz, but was ordered to stay. Later in the day, the Arabs captured the Russian Orthodox monastery, which the Haganah used as a perimeter fortress for the Kfar Etzion area, killing twenty-four of its thirty-two defenders.

On May 13, an attack broke through Kfar Etzion&#x27;s defences and reached the settlement&#x27;s centre effectively cutting off the perimeter outposts from each other.

==Massacre==
In the Israeli mainstream version, when the hopelessness of their position became undeniable on May 13, dozens of defenders, the &quot;haverim&quot;, of Kfar Etzion laid down their arms and assembled in the courtyard, where they suddenly began to be shot at. Those not slain in the first volleys of fire pushed past the Arabs, and either escaped to hide, or gathered their weapons, and were hunted down. The number of people killed and the perpetrators, the Arab legion or local village irregulars or both, are in dispute. According to one account, the main group of about 50 defenders were surrounded by a large number of Arab irregulars, who shouted &quot;Deir Yassin!&quot; and ordered the Jews to sit down, stand up, and sit down again, when suddenly someone opened fire on the Jews with a machine gun and others joined in the killing. Those Jews not immediately cut down tried to run away but were pursued. According to Meron Benvenisti, hand grenades were thrown into a cellar, killing a group of 50 who were hiding there. The building was blown up.

According to other sources, 20 women hiding in a cellar were killed. David Ohana writes that 127 Israeli fighters were killed on the last day.
Arab losses during the two day battle, according to a Haganah estimate, numbered 69: 42 irregulars, and 27 legionnaires. A number of Israeli histories of the Kfar Etzion massacre (such as Levi, 1986, Isseroff, 2005) state that the defenders had put out the white flag and lined up to surrender in front of the school building of the German monastery. An Arab version recounts that a white flag was flown, and drew the Arabs into a trap where they were fired on. Benny Morris cites a Legion officer&#x27;s statement that the defenders had not formally surrendered, that some resistance continued, with shooting at Arabs, after others had surrendered, that local villagers shot legionnaires trying to defend prisoners, and that legionnaires had to shoot some villagers engaged in the killings. The figure of 127 fatalities appears to include both those who surrendered only to be slain, and the defenders who had been killed in battle over 12–13 May.

In another account, after the 133 defenders had assembled, they were photographed by a man in a kaffiyeh, and then an armored car apparently belonging to the Arab Legion opened fire with its machine gun, and then Arab irregulars joined in. A group of defenders managed to crawl into the cellar of the monastery, where they defended themselves until a large number of grenades were thrown into the cellar. The building was then blown up and collapsed on them.

About 129 persons died in the battle and its aftermath. Only three of the remaining Kfar Etzion residents and one Palmach member survived. According to their own testimony, the circumstances of their survival were as follows.
* Yaacov Edelstein and Yitzhak Ben-Sira tried to hide amongst a jumble of boulders and branches, but they were discovered by a &quot;wrinkled, toothless, old Arab&quot; who told them &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid.&quot; Then a group of Arab irregulars rushed up and threw them against a wall. The old Arab tried to shield them with his body. As they argued, two Arab Legionnaires came up and took the two Jews under their protection.
* Nahum Ben-Sira, the brother of Yitzhak, was away from the main group when the massacre started. He hid until nightfall then escaped to a nearby kibbutz.
* Alisa Feuchtwanger (Palmach) tried to hide in a ditch with several others. They were discovered and all were killed except Alisa, who was dragged away by several Arab irregulars. As the group were trying to rape her, an Arab Legion officer (Captain Hikmat Mihyar) arrived, shot two of the perpetrators and sent the rest away. Afterwards the officer gave her bread, waited until she finished eating, and said to her (quote) &quot;You are under my protection&quot;. She testified that while the officer took her to safety, he shot dead wounded Jews.

Both Alisa and Nahum said that the Legion soldiers actively participated in the massacre.

A total of 157 defenders died in the battle of Gush Etzion (Levi, 1986), including those killed in the massacre at Kfar Etzion. About 2/3 of them were residents and the remainder were Hagana or Palmach soldiers. Israeli historical geographer Yossi Katz put the death toll at 220. Most of the kibbutz&#x27;s male residents were killed.

On the following day, the Arab irregular forces continued their assault on the remaining three Etzion settlements. Fearing that the defenders might suffer the same fate as those of Kfar Etzion, Zionist leaders in Jerusalem negotiated a deal for the surrender of the settlements on condition that the Arab Legion protected the residents. The Red Cross took the wounded to Jerusalem, and the Arab Legion took the remainder as prisoners of war. In March 1949 320 prisoners from the Etzion settlements were released from the &quot;Jordan POW camp at Mafrak&quot;, including 85 women.

==Aftermath==

On October 28, 1948, the Arab village al-Dawayima was conquered by the IDF 89th Commando Battalion. They then committed the Al-Dawayima massacre, as the villagers were blamed for the Kfar Etzion massacre. Estimates of the number of killed Arab villagers range from 80–100 to 100–200, depending on the source.

The bodies of the killed of Kfar Etzion were left at the site for a year and a half, until in November 1949, the Chief Military Rabbi, Shlomo Goren was allowed to collect their bones. They were buried in a full military funeral on November 17 in Mount Herzl in Jerusalem, which about half of the population of Jerusalem attended. Their communal grave was the first grave in what is today the military cemetery of Mount Herzl.

The Etzion Bloc became a symbol of Zionist heroism and martyrdom among Israelis immediately after its fall, and this importance continues. The date of the massacre was enshrined as Israel&#x27;s Day of Remembrance.

The site of the Etzion Bloc was recaptured by Israel during the 1967 war. The children who had been evacuated from the Bloc in 1948 led a public campaign for the Bloc to be resettled, and Prime Minister Levi Eshkol gave his approval. Kfar Etzion was re-established as a kibbutz in September 1967, as the first Israeli settlement in the West Bank after the war.

<doc id="462663" wikidata="Q1252942" url="?curid=462663" title="Duklja">
<text>Duklja (; ; ) was a medieval South Slavic state which roughly encompassed the territories of modern-day southeastern Montenegro, from the Bay of Kotor in the west to the Bojana river in the east, and to the sources of the Zeta and Morača rivers in the north. First mentioned in 10th– and 11th-century Byzantine chronicles, it was a vassal of the Bulgarian Empire between 997 and 1018, and then of the Byzantine Empire until it became independent in 1040 under Stefan Vojislav ( 1034–43) who rose up and managed to take over territories of the earlier Serbian Principality, founding the Vojislavljević dynasty. Between 1043 and 1080, under Mihailo Vojislavljević ( 1050–81), and his son, Constantine Bodin ( 1081–1101), Duklja saw its apogee. Mihailo was given the nominal title &quot;King of Slavs&quot; by the Pope after having left the Byzantine camp and supported an uprising in the Balkans, in which his son Bodin played a central part. Having incorporated the Serbian hinterland (known as Grand Principality of Serbia, and anachronistically as &quot;Raška&quot;) and installed vassal rulers there, this maritime principality emerged as the most powerful Serb polity, seen in the titles used by its rulers (&quot;Prince of Serbia&quot;, &quot;of Serbs&quot;). However, its rise was short-lived, as Bodin was defeated by the Byzantines and imprisoned; pushed to the background, his relative and vassal Vukan became independent in Raška, which continued the fight against the Byzantines while Duklja was struck with civil wars. Between 1113 and 1149 Duklja was the centre of Serbian–Byzantine conflict, with members of the Vojislavljević as protégés of either fighting each other for power. Duklja was then incorporated as a crown land of the Grand Principality of Serbia ruled by the Vukanović dynasty, subsequently known as &quot;Zeta&quot;, remaining so until the fall of the Serbian Empire in the 14th century.

==Etymology==
In historiography, K. Jirechek was the first to use &quot;Duklja&quot;. &quot;Doclea&quot; was originally the name of the Roman city on the site of modern Podgorica (Ribnica), built by Roman Emperor Diocletian, who hailed from this region of Roman Dalmatia. The Romanized Illyrian tribe known as &quot;Docleatae&quot; that inhabited the area derived their name from the city. In later centuries, the Romans hypercorrected the name to &quot;Dioclea&quot;, wrongly guessing that an &quot;i&quot; had been lost due to vulgar speech patterns. &quot;Duklja&quot; is the later Slavic version of the name of this region, attributed to the principality under Byzantine suzerainty (&quot;Diokleia&quot;, Διόκλεια). The demonym, or tribal name, appearing in &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; was &quot;Dioklētianoi&quot; (Διοκλητιανοί).

==Geography==
According to &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; (948–952), in chapter 35, &quot;Diokleia&quot; (Διόκλεια) included the &quot;large, inhabited cities&quot; of Gradetai, Nougrade, and Lontodokla. Gradetai may have been Starigrad, Nougrade may have been Prevlaka, while the location of Lontodokla is uncertain.

According to the later, somewhat dubious source, &quot;Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja&quot;, a ruler named Hvalimir who was alleged to be an ancestor of Jovan Vladimir (ca. 990–1016), held Zeta and its towns, and the following counties: Lusca (Luška), Podlugiae (Podlužje), Gorsca (Gorska), Cupelnich (Kupelnik), Obliquus (Oblik), Prapratna, Cermeniza (Crmnica) and Budua (Budva) with Cuceva (Kučevo) and Gripuli (Grbalj).

Since the 12th century, the term &quot;Zeta&quot; began to replace the name Duklja.

==&quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;==
The &quot;DAI&quot; claims that Duklja had been made desolate by the Avars and &quot;repopulated in the time of the Emperor Heraclius, just as were Croatia and Serbia&quot; (i.e. in the first half of the 7th century), by Slavs. While he clearly states that the neighbouring principalities of Serbia, Pagania, Zahumlje, Travunia and Kanalites had been settled by the &#x27;unbaptized Serbs&#x27;, he mentions Duklja simply as having been settled by &#x27;Slavs&#x27;. The statements of various Byzantine writers in which the Diocleans are also called as Serbs, Croats, and Dalmati do not allow equalization of Duklja inhabitants until 12th century either with the Serbs or with the Croats. Scholars have debated at length as to the reliability of &quot;DAI&quot;. For example, Francis Dvornik and Florin Curta, among others, suggested that the &quot;DAI&quot; was a political document, rather than a strictly historical one and that it probably indicates that the coastal županijas were under the authority of the Serbian prince, Časlav Klonimirović, in the mid-10th century. Tibor Živković, Neven Budak and Hrvoje Gračanin also concluded that a closer reading suggests that Constantine consideration about regional ethnic identity is based on Serbian political rule and expansion in the 10th century which does not necessarily indicate ethnic origin. Relja Novaković also came to a similar conclusion. John V.A. Fine argues &quot;given that Serbs settled in regions along its borders, presumably this would have also been a Serb region&quot;. Ivo Banac proposed that the &quot;DAI&quot; mention that a part of the Croats &quot;split off and took control of Illyricum and Pannonia&quot; after settling western part of the province of Dalmatia could be connected to Duklja, while &quot;Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja&quot; calls that area as Red Croatia. According to historian Sima Ćirković, although Constantine VII does not mention tribes of whom peoples of Duklja originate, the authors of the XI century considered rulers of Zeta to be Serbs and sometimes call their land Serbia. Ćirković also considers that this narrow scientific question has been politicized by opposing Diocleans to Serbs and ignoring historical sources from 11th and 12th century. The dubious &quot;Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja&quot;, compiled in 1298–1301 by a Cistercian monk in the service of Paul I Šubić of Bribir, nevertheless if does again promote mere Byzantine confusion over Serbs and Croats, with other historical sources does allude to the existence of Croats and their political influence far into Montenegrin inland until the late 12th century.

Ultimately, the origins of Duklja are not known with certainty, for the literary evidence often rests on semi-legendary genealogies. Moreover, what actually constituted a people (&quot;gens&quot;) in the Middle Ages has been rigorously debated. There is no clear evidence that peoples known as Serbs or Croats migrated &quot;en masse&quot; as coherent nations able to resettle large territories, and that arrived as small military elites which assimilated and organized other already settled Slavs. Both Florin Curta and John Fine, among other medievalists, have argued that ethnonyms such as Serb or Croat were primarily political labels referring to a &quot;dux&quot; and his retinue of nobles as well as military elite, while on a lower level it also referred the mass of commoners who inhabited the territory under the often nominal and transient rule of such leaders. There is little evidence that a modern notion of nation-type ethnicity, and the values associated with it, existed in medieval societies. Rather, some sort of group identity began to form within the Balkans from the late 7th century as Slavic notables formed a system of alliances. This coincides with the final demise of Avar hegemony over the western Balkans. At the same time, the Byzantines had begun to re-establish some control in parts of the Balkans after the 7th-century collapse of imperial control. The establishment of the Byzantine theme of Dyrrhachium facilitated diplomatic contacts between the East Romans and the Adriatic &quot;Sclaviniae&quot;.

Rather, for the general masses, identity was rooted primarily with one&#x27;s own clan, village and region. As Fine states, &quot;In this large region settled by Slavs, all of whom spoke the same language, certain political entities emerged, and that is all that they were, political entities&quot;. Duklja was one such polity, and its subsequent history was closely intertwined with that of Serbia/Rascia and the Byzantine Empire, and as well as Rome and &#x27;western&#x27; powers. As such Duklja is seen as one of the medieval Serb states and was the political and cultural predecessor of modern Montenegro.

==Early history==
Little is known about Duklja prior to the 11th century. The main source on the history of early South Slavic states is &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; by Emperor Constantine VII (compiled before 952). The work mentions virtually nothing about Duklja apart from that it was settled by Slavs and was ruled by the Byzantine Emperors. It probably did not exist as an established, independent polity before the late 10th century. The Byzantines ruled over coastal cities such as Doclea, Bar, Kotor, and the hinterland surrounding these. Archaeological evidence (a personal seal belonging to &quot;Peter of Diokleia&quot;) suggests that local officials governed this small region in the name of the Emperor. The Slav regions that were not directly under Byzantine rule (such as Travunia) were organized into numerous &quot;župa&quot;, (roughly, a county) ruled by local families.

Slav raids on Eastern Roman territory are mentioned in 518, and by the 580s they had conquered large areas referred to as &quot;Sclavinia&quot; (&quot;Slavdom&quot;, from &quot;Sklavenoi&quot;). Duklja was settled by Slavs predominantly during the 7th century, although the area was subject to raids by Avars and Slavs from the 6th century. Being a mountainous region, it perhaps served as an area of refuge for pre-Slavic populations. According to Noel Malcolm, today&#x27;s western Serbia was area where Serbs settled in 7th century and from there they expanded their rule on territory of Duklja. 
Prince Višeslav (fl. 768–814), the first known Serbian monarch by name, ruled the hereditary lands (Županias, &quot;counties&quot;) of &quot;Neretva, Tara, Piva, Lim&quot;. He managed to unite several more provinces and tribes into what would become the Serbian Principality. Višeslav was succeeded by his son Radoslav and then Prosigoj, during that time the Serbs were people &quot;who are said to hold a great/large part of Dalmatia&quot; (&quot;ad Sorabos, quae natio magnam Dalmatiae partem obtinere dicitur&quot;, Royal Frankish Annals, 822), but according to John (Jr.) Fine, it was hard to find Serbs in this area since the Byzantine sources were limited to the southern coast, but it is possible that among other tribes existed a tribe or group of small tribes of Serbs. Prince Vlastimir further united Serbian tribes against the growing threat from the Bulgarian Empire, his realm spanned over southwestern Serbia, much of Montenegro, eastern Herzegovina and southeastern Bosnia. Prince Petar Gojniković expanded along the Neretva, annexing the Narentines, where he seems to have come into conflict with Michael Višević, a Bulgarian ally and the ruler of Zahumlje (with Trebinje and most of what would later be Duklja). Michael Višević heard of the possible alliance between Serbia and the Byzantines, and warned Symeon. Symeon defeats Petar and in the following years there is a power struggle between the Bulgars and Byzantines over Serbian overlordship. Prince Časlav ruled over a confederacy of tribes covering an expansive area. Some consider he took over regions previously held by Michael, who disappears from sources in 925.

After Časlav died in ca. 960, Stari Ras and probably also Serbian lands were annexed by the Byzantines who formed Catepanate of Ras. A Peter, whose seal has been found, was the &quot;archon Diokleias&quot; probably at the turn of the 11th century. A Serbian diplomatic mission, likely sent from Duklja, arrived at the Byzantine capital of Constantinople and was recorded in a charter of the Great Lavra Monastery, written in 993. In the 11th century, Jovan Vladimir ruled Duklja, with his court centered in Bar on the Adriatic coast; he held much of the Pomorje under his control including Travunija and Zachlumia. His realm may have stretched west- and northwards to include some parts of the &quot;Zagorje&quot; (inland Serbia and Bosnia) as well. Vladimir&#x27;s pre-eminent position over other Slavic nobles in the area explains why Emperor Basil approached him for an anti-Bulgarian alliance. With his hands tied by war in Anatolia, Basil required allies for his war against Tsar Samuel, who ruled the Bulgarian empire stretching over Northern Bulgaria, Western Bulgaria, Macedonia, Serbia, Raška and Epirus. Samuel invaded Duklja in 997, and pushed through Dalmatia up to the city of Zadar, incorporating Bosnia and Serbia into his realm. After defeating Vladimir, Samuel reinstated him as a vassal Prince. We do not know what Vladimir&#x27;s connection was to the previous Serbian dynasty as much of what is written in the &quot;Chronicles of the Priest of Duklja&quot; about the genealogy of the Doclean rulers is mythological. Vladimir was murdered by Vladislav, Samuel&#x27;s brother and successor, circa 1016 AD. The last prominent member of his family, his uncle Dragimir, was killed by some local citizens in Kotor in 1018. That same year, the Byzantines had defeated the Bulgarians, and in one masterful stroke re-took virtually the entire Balkans.

==Rise==
The Byzantine victory over the Bulgarians was a critical development in Balkan history. The Byzantines ruled most of the Balkans – Bulgaria, Serbia, Duklja, and Bosnia all fell back under Byzantine rule for the first time since the 6th century.
Over much of the 11th century, we hear very little about events from the interior. Central Serbia was probably under the jurisdiction of the &quot;strategos&quot; (governor) of Sirmium – Constantine Diogenes. Some historians suggest that Duklja was ruled directly by the &quot;strategos&quot; of Dyrrhachium, while others posit that a native prince (whose name has not survived) was allowed to remain, ruling as a Byzantine vassal. Either way, the Slavic nobility was under Byzantine control.

Short-lived as it was, Vladimir&#x27;s influence in Balkan politics shifted the centre of Serbian rule from inland Serbia to the coast. This was a &quot;renewed Serbian state centered on Duklja&quot;.

In the 1030s, as Skylitzes and Kekaumenos have written, Stefan Vojislav, who held the title of &quot;&quot;archont&quot;, and toparch of the &quot;kastra&quot; of Dalmatia, Zeta and Ston&quot;, led the &quot;Serbs who renounced Byzantine rule&quot;. According to the &quot;CPD&quot;, he was a nephew of Vladimir. In 1034, he took &quot;Duklja&quot; while the Byzantines were switching thrones. The Byzantines retaliated by sending in troops from Dyrrhachium and captured Vojislav, who was taken prisoner to Constantinople. He managed to escape and began a guerrilla resistance from Duklja&#x27;s mountains. He defeated several Byzantine expeditions and liberated most of Duklja. A Slav rebellion centered on Belgrade, organised by Peter Delian in the late 1030s, worked in Vojislav&#x27;s favour by diverting attention from Duklja. He used this to assert rule from his capital in Scutari, and extended his rule from Duklja to Travunia and a part of Zachlumia. He besieged the Byzantine city of Dyrrhachium and held the lands surrounding it.

In 1042, another Byzantine attack was defeated. The Byzantines had sent a &quot;coalition&quot; of vassal Slavic chiefs to fight Voislav. The coalition consisted of the Župan of Bosnia, Knez (Prince) Ljutovid of Zachlumia and the Župan of Raska. Fine suggests that under Byzantine dominance, &quot;Rascia&quot; had in the 1040s emerged as yet another Serbian state (roughly centered on what is now southern Serbia and Kosovo. Vojislav won a great victory against his attackers. He overthrew ljutovid and placed the region entirely under his control. Duklja was undoubtedly the leading Slavic state.
Vojislav probably died in 1043. Of his 5 sons, Mihailo (Michael) eventually secured rule by 1046. He was an apt diplomat, he fostered good relations with the Byzantines by marrying one of the Emperor&#x27;s relatives, earning himself the title &quot;protostrator&quot;. He also entered diplomatic relations with the western powers by marrying one of his sons, Constantine Bodin, to the daughter of the Norman governor of Bari. Michael conquered Rascia from the Byzantines in the 1060s and assigned one of his sons, Petrislav as ruler. In 1072, he supported another Slav rebellion in Macedonia by sending a force led by his son Constantine Bodin. After initial success, &quot;The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja&quot; claims that Bodin was proclaimed Tsar Peter III of Bulgaria. A Byzantine retaliation, however, resulted in Bodin&#x27;s capture, only to be freed by Venetian mercenaries hired by his father.

At some point during his rule, Michael acquired the title of King. Most scholars place this date to 1077, when he received a legate from the Pope referring to him as the &quot;King of Slavs&quot;. However, Curta suggests that Michael may have been King as early as 1053, since he proclaimed himself &#x27;King&#x27; sometime after receiving the &quot;protostrator&quot; title from the Emperor. However, formal recognition as King in medieval Europe required acknowledgement either from the Pope or the Byzantine Emperor. Either way, he was King by 1077.

When Michael died in 1081, he was succeeded by his son Constantine Bodin. The Normans attacked southern Dalmatia, capturing Dyrrhachium and Ragusa. Bodin was expected to aid the Emperor at Dyrrhachium, instead he remained idle (possibly as part of a pre-conceived plan with the Normans) and watched the Byzantines get utterly defeated. During his early rule, energy spent consolidating his rule and meddling with Byzantine-Norman matters diverted Bodin&#x27;s attention from other parts of his realm. The &quot;Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja&quot; notes that Bodin sent expedition into Bosnia and Rascia. Since his father, Michael, had already captured Raska earlier, it must have slipped out of Duklja&#x27;s control. Bodin successfully marched against Raska and placed his cousins Vukan and Marko (the sons of Petrislav) as župans. He also captured Bosnia, and placed one of his courtiers, Stipan, to rule in his name. Although Bodin was recognised as &quot;&#x27;King of Duklja and Dalmatia&quot;, there is no evidence to suggest that Bosnia, Zachlumia, Duklja and Rascia were incorporated into an integrated kingdom. Each region retained its own hereditary nobility, but were under the political and military sway of Duklja.
By 1085 the Byzantines got the upper hand in their wars with the Normans, recapturing Dyrrachium and Ragusa. In 1090, they punished Bodin for his impudence, possibly capturing him for the second time, and not much is known about him subsequently until he dies in c. 1101. Raska, Zahumlje and Bosnia probably broke free from Dukljan vassalage.

In the 10th century, following the Synod of Split, Split gained jurisdiction over much of the Dalmatian coast, except southern regions (including most of Duklja), which were under the Archbisphopric of Dyrrhachium. However, Split&#x27;s pre-eminent position was soon challenged by other cities vying for metropolinate status – Bar and Dubrovnik (Ragusa). The East-West Schism would soon have a great impact upon Serbia, not only religiously, but also politically. Since Serbia was positioned at the border zone between Roman and Constantinopolitan jurisdiction, Serb rulers tried to exploit this rivalry to their advantage. The Slavs who lived along the southern Dalmatian coast fell under the religious jurisdiction of Rome, via the Archbishops of Split, Bar and Ragusa. The rest, in the hinterland stretching to Serbia, were under the Patriarch of Constantinople via the Archbishops of Ohrid, Sirmium and Dyrrhachium. King Mihailo&#x27;s prerogative was to establish an autocephalous Slavic Church – an independent state requires an independent church. For political reasons, he turned to Rome, since at the time he was in less than amicable relations with Byzantium. Michael presumed that the Pope would jump at the chance to expand his jurisdiction in southern Dalmatia, but Michael&#x27;s wish was not easily forthcoming. Although some studies have stated that his request to raise Bar to an Archbishopric was granted in 1067, it seems that the cited bull is not authentic. In 1089, Constantine Bodin managed to raise the bishopric of Bar to an Archbishopric, by supporting the pope against an antipope. The suffragan bishops were to be: Kotor, Ulcinj, Svač, Skadar, Drivast, Pula, Ras, Bosnia and Trebinje. In obtaining its promotion, it acquired a much larger diocese, including territory that earlier had not been under the pope – territories of the metropolitan of Durazzo and Archbishop of Ochrid, two sees that recognized the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Bar Archbishopric&#x27;s new territory were merely theoretical – the pope&#x27;s edict could only affect the churches that recognized Rome. Making &quot;Rascia&quot; a suffragan to Bar had little meaning, as most of its churches were under Constantinople, and there is no evidence of Vukan changing adherence to Rome. Durazzo and Ochrid may have suffered minimal territorial losses along the coast, Duklja was briefly a subject to Rome, however inland Duklja was not affected, and along with much of Duklja&#x27;s coast (like most of Kotor) was to retain its loyalty to Orthodoxy.

==Decline==
With Bodin gone, his Norman wife, Jaquinta, feared that Bodin&#x27;s nephew, Branislav, would try to seize power before her young children could take the throne. She ordered the arrest of Branislav and his family and Branislav died in captivity, while his other 6 brothers and sons found asylum in Ragusa. Thus in the haste to claim the throne, seeds of family hatred were planted among the extended family. After Bodin died, his half-brother Dobroslav II gained the throne of Duklja. Seeing a weak Duklja, the Byzantines started to meddle, sending Kočopar, one of Branislav&#x27;s exiled brothers to capture the throne. He managed to get assistance from Vukan of Raška, and together they beat Dobroslav. However, there was a falling out between Kočopar and Vukan. Vukan drove out Kočopar, who then died in exile. The Doclean nobles then elected a Vladimir, yet another relative, who ruled in peace as a Byzantine vassal. But Jaquinta had not given up. After Vladimir died, she had Dobroslav II (who was still in jail) castrated and blinded in case he were to gain the throne, thus securing the throne for her son Đurađ (George), c. 1114–18. She had gained support from an anti-Byzantine faction of nobles. Branislav&#x27;s family again fled to Byzantine safety, this time in Dyrrhachium. There they gained support from the Byzantines, who ousted Đurađ and imprisoned Jaquinta. Grubeša, one of Branislav&#x27;s sons, was placed on the throne in 1118. He ruled peacefully until 1125. Đurađ had fled to Rascia, and secured the support of the new Rascian Grand Župan, Uroš, believed to be the nephew of Vukan. Uroš was aligned with the Hungarians, and was anti-Byzantine. He invaded Duklja and placed Đurađ back on the throne. Yet another Byzantine intervention ousted Đurađ for the second time, capturing him, and he died in captivity. Gradinja, one of Grubeša&#x27;s brothers was then placed as King, the last ruler to hold such a title in Duklja. He died a natural death in 1146, and was succeeded by his son Radoslav. Radoslav only bore the title Knez (Prince).

Duklja&#x27;s long internecine strife was devastating for its status, as it was reduced back to a Principality dependent on Byzantine support, and was increasingly losing territory to Raska. By the time of Radoslav&#x27;s reign as prince, he only held a small strip of land on the Dukljan coast (From Kotor to Ulcinj). By 1166, much of Duklja was occupied by Rascia, and in 1186, Stefan Nemanja annexed Duklja in its entirety after defeating the last Doclean prince – Mihailo.

<text>The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) was a non-departmental public body of the Government of the United Kingdom which existed from 1 April 2006 until 7 October 2013. SOCA was a national law enforcement agency with Home Office sponsorship, established as a body corporate under Section 1 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. It operated within the United Kingdom and collaborated (through its network of international offices) with many foreign law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

The Agency was formed following a merger of the National Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence Service (elements of which were incorporated into AVCIS), the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU), the investigative and intelligence sections of HM Revenue &amp; Customs on serious drug trafficking, and the Immigration Service&#x27;s responsibilities for organised immigration crime. The Assets Recovery Agency became part of SOCA in 2008, while the Serious Fraud Office remained a separate agency.

SOCA Officers could be designated the powers of a constable, customs officer or immigration officer and/or any combination of these three sets of powers. The Director General of SOCA (or his designate) was responsible for determining which powers were given to members of staff which could be altered depending on the nature of the investigation. Those police powers requiring a constable to be in uniform could not be exercised by SOCA Officers as the agency was non-uniformed.

SOCA operated with greater powers in England and Wales than in Scotland and Northern Ireland and as such worked with the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency and the Organised Crime Task Force (Northern Ireland), which shared some of its functions in their respective jurisdictions.

In June 2011, the coalition government announced that SOCA&#x27;s operations would be merged into a larger National Crime Agency to launch in 2013. The new agency, created through the Crime and Courts Act 2013, commenced operations on 7 October 2013.

==Overview==
The creation of the agency was announced on 9 February 2004 as one of the elements of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, which also restricts protests and demonstrations in central London, and alters powers of arrest and the use of search warrants. According to Home Office figures organised crime costs the UK around £20 billion each year, with some estimates putting the figure as high as £40 billion.

SOCA had a national remit and the role of the agency was to support individual police forces in the investigation of crime and conduct independent investigations with regard to serious organised crime. SOCA was an agency which had the role of &quot;reducing harm&quot;, not specifically the arrest and conviction of offenders.

Elements of the media attempted to draw parallels between the organisation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States: indeed, parts of the press labelled SOCA the &quot;British FBI.&quot;

SOCA was subject to similar internal and external governance mechanisms as the police service. The SOCA Professional Standards Department was responsible for receiving, investigating and monitoring the progress of public complaints about the misconduct of SOCA officers. Serious complaints regarding SOCA were dealt with by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) now the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC). The IPCC would decide the appropriate method of investigation. In general terms, the IPCC would handle complaints against SOCA officers in the same manner as complaints against police officers or officers of HMRC. The Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland (PONI) dealt with complaints in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, this was the responsibility of the Lord Advocate. There was also a bespoke inspection regime for SOCA, provided through Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC).

==Governance==
The agency was an executive non-departmental public body sponsored by, but operationally independent from, the Home Office. It was funded by the UK&#x27;s central government, with a provisional budget for 2006/7 of £457m, of which £416m funded on-going resources and £41m was capital investment. At formation it was intended to have around 4,200 employees, of which 400 were support staff. Of the remaining workforce, half would be criminal investigators and the other half would focus on analysis and intelligence. SOCA co-operated closely with the police, intelligence agencies, HM Revenue &amp; Customs, foreign police forces and others.

SOCA was led by a board comprising non-executive and executive members. The founding non-executive chairman, responsible for the overall approach of the Agency, was Sir Stephen Lander, former Director General of the Security Service (MI5). Lander was succeeded by Sir Ian Andrews, a former MOD Civil Servant. The other original non-executive directors of the board were Stephen Barrett, Elizabeth France, Ken Jarrold, Janet Paraskeva and General Sir Roger Wheeler. Prior to closure, the non-executive directors were Peter Clarke, Sue Garrard, Francis Plowden and Dr Martyn Thomas. The original executive directors of the board were David Bolt, Malcolm Cornberg, Paul Evans and Trevor Pearce, and today they are Malcolm Cornberg, Paul Evans, Trevor Pearce and Brad Jones. The agency&#x27;s headquarters were in Victoria, not far from New Scotland Yard. There was also an office in Vauxhall, South London, not far from the Palace of Westminster and the SIS Building.

The founding Director General was Bill Hughes, formerly of the National Crime Squad. Hughes retired in 2010 and was succeeded by Trevor Pearce, who until then was Executive Director of SOCA&#x27;s Enforcement Directorate.

The board directed that around 40% of its effort should be devoted to combating drug trafficking, 25% to tackling organised immigration crime, around 10% to fraud, 15% on other organised crime and the remaining 10% on supporting other law enforcement agencies.

==Organisation==
The organisation was split into three major directorates:

*Strategy and Prevention - Responsible for driving SOCA strategy and reflecting government priorities. Bringing together those functions focussed on preventative activity with partners such as disruption of criminal activities and denial of assets.
*Operational Delivery - Responsible for identifying how and where the desired impact and response can be achieved, planning and executing operations and the subsequent criminal justice and other disruptive interventions.
*Capability and Service Delivery - Supporting activities

The Agency had to deal with the effects of significant budget cuts that have affected both its strategy for dealing with organised crime and its ability to retain experienced police officers.

The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) operated as an independent component of SOCA and was staffed by SOCA officers. The task of online child protection had previously been (in part) the responsibility of the NHTCU. CEOP recently announced the opening of the CEOP Academy, designed to be a centre of excellence in this area of law enforcement. CEOP works in conjunction with New Scotland Yard Child Abuse Investigation Command which has its own hi-tech unit.

On 1 April 2012, the Missing Persons Bureau, Central Witness Bureau, Specialist Operations Centre, Crime Operational Support and Serious Crime Analysis Section transferred from the National Policing Improvement Agency to SOCA, as an interim measure ahead of the proposed establishment of the National Crime Agency in 2013. CEOP became an independent command of the National Crime Agency when it began operations on 7 October 2013.

==Operations==
===National Central Bureau===
SOCA acted as the UK point of contact for Interpol, Europol and the Schengen Information System.

In this capacity SOCA maintained the following functions:
* Single point of contact for International enquiries from SOCA and all UK Police and law enforcement agencies.
* 24/7 capacity for Interpol with direct connections to their databases and provides a specialist service to Europol through Europol Liaison Officers.
* Coordination of all inbound and outbound Cross Border Surveillance requests with Schengen partners.
* Dedicated Fugitives Unit that acts as the UK Central Authority for all European Arrest Warrants (EAW).

===Serious Crime Analysis Section (SCAS)===
The Serious Crime Analysis Section moved to SOCA from the National Policing Improvement Agency on 1 April 2012 in advance of the planned establishment of the National Crime Agency in 2013. SCAS is based at Foxley Hall in the grounds of the Police Staff College, Bramshill in Hampshire. It was originally formed by the Home Office in 1998 to identify the potential emergence of serial killers and serial rapists at the earliest stage of their offending. This scope has since broadened to include the analysis by specialist staff of rapes, serious sexual assaults and motiveless or sexually motivated murders.

Criminal case files are received by SCAS from all police forces in the UK at an early stage in the investigations. The information is coded and placed on a single database, ViCLAS (Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System). The system was developed in Canada by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

The investigating officer receives a report from a crime analyst with a number of key elements designed to assist the investigation. It will identify if there are grounds to believe that the offender has previously been identified. It will also provide a breakdown of the behaviour exhibited in the offence, often with a statistical description of some of the elements involved. This can alert an investigator to the importance of some aspects of the offence not immediately apparent. SCAS are also responsible for identifying good practice, or &quot;what works&quot;, so the analyst&#x27;s report may contain &quot;investigative suggestions&quot; that might guide the officer to a specific line of enquiry not yet considered. The report may also suggest possible suspects that the unit has identified from a number of databases. When a prime suspect has been identified and charged with an offence, senior analysts are able to provide specialist evidence in court, to assist with the prosecution of offenders.

===Crime Operational Support===
The Crime Operational Support unit also moved to SOCA, and provides specialist operational skills and to assist in the resolution of exceptional crime series and operational critical incidents.

Four regional teams of investigative advisers support regional investigations, and are themselves supported by the specialist skills of crime investigation officers, behavioural investigative advisers and geographic profilers. The unit identifies best practice in investigations, and makes these known through workshops and seminars.

===Missing Persons Bureau===
The Missing Persons Bureau (MPB) transferred to SOCA in April 2012 along with SCAS. It had previously been based at New Scotland Yard until April 2008 when it was moved to the NPIA and based in Bramshill.

The bureau acts as the centre for the exchange of information connected with the search for missing persons nationally and internationally. It is responsible for cross-matching missing persons with unidentified persons or bodies, as well as maintaining an index of dental records of missing persons and unidentified bodies.

The MPB also manages a missing persons and Child Rescue Alert website, and analyses data to identify trends and patterns in disappearances.

===National Injuries Database===
The National Injuries Database also transferred from the NPIA. It provides additional support to police forces by providing analysis of weapons and wounds, and seeking to identify similarities to aid investigators in determining which weapon may have been used. The database holds over 4,000 cases of suspicious deaths, murders and clinical cases, and contains over 20,000 images.

===Money laundering===
SOCA via the UK Financial Intelligence Unit took over responsibility for dealing with suspicious activity reports (SARs), previously made to the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) under the money laundering legislation.

NCIS received just under 200,000 SARs in 2005 and throughout its active life was widely critical of the banking and financial services sector, and the Financial Services Authority, for not being more transparent or forthcoming in reporting their customers suspicious activity.

Despite criticism from professional representative bodies that the disclosure rules are too broad, SOCA has said that up to one in three SARs lead to or add substantially to terrorism investigations; that HMRC estimates that around one in five SARs identifies new subjects of interest, and one in four SARs lead to direct tax enquiries; and that many arrests and confiscations of criminal assets.

The Assets Recovery Agency became part of the Serious Organised Crime Agency from April 2008. The power to launch civil recovery proceedings has been extended to the three main prosecutors in England and Wales; the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office (RCPO) and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). It will also be extended to the Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in Scotland.

===Computer crime===
Officers from the former National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) became SOCA&#x27;s e-crime unit. However, the remit of this unit is much narrower than that of the body it replaced. In particular, the NHTCU had established a confidentiality charter to encourage victims of computer crime to contact the police in confidence, because many corporate victims in particular do not report attacks due to fears of bad publicity. The loss of the confidentiality charter has been widely criticised. although similar protection is now provided by the same Act of Parliament used to create SOCA. The Metropolitan Police is to help bridge the gap left by the disbandment of the NHTCU through an expansion of its Computer Unit and the formation of the Police Central e-crime Unit (PCeU), which will work closely with the new National Fraud Reporting Centre (NFRC) from 2009.

==Website outages==
The SOCA public information website, hosted by a third party, was subjected to a number of Distributed denial-of-service attack (DDOS) attacks. Hacker group LulzSec claimed responsibility for the attack on 20 June 2011, including a suggestion that the DDOS attack was a cover for real hacking.

<doc id="462670" wikidata="Q2708105" url="?curid=462670" title="Howard the Duck">
<text>Howard the Duck is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Steve Gerber, based very loosely on his college friend Howard Tockman, and artist Val Mayerik. Howard the Duck first appeared in &quot;Adventure into Fear&quot; #19 (cover-dated Dec. 1973) and several subsequent series have chronicled the misadventures of the ill-tempered anthropomorphic animal trapped on a human-dominated Earth. Echoing this, the most common tagline of his comics reads &#x27;Trapped In a World He Never Made!&#x27;.

Howard&#x27;s adventures are generally social satires, while a few are parodies of genre fiction with a metafictional awareness of the medium. The book is existentialist, and its main joke, according to Gerber, is that there is no joke: &quot;... that life&#x27;s most serious moments and most incredibly dumb moments are often distinguishable only by a momentary point of view.&quot; Gloria Katz, producer of the notorious, ill-fated 1986 film adaptation of the comic, expressed a diametrically opposed opinion of the character, &quot;It&#x27;s a film about a duck from outer space ... It&#x27;s not supposed to be an existential experience.&quot;

Howard the Duck was portrayed by Ed Gale and voiced by Chip Zien in the critically and commercially unsuccessful 1986 self-titled film. Starting in 2014, the character, voiced by Seth Green, appeared in cameos in several Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films, the Disney XD animated series &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; (2015–19) and &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; (2016; with Kevin Michael Richardson), and the Disney+ series &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021–2024).

==Publication history==

Howard the Duck was created by writer Steve Gerber and penciler Val Mayerik in &quot;Adventure into Fear&quot; #19 (Dec. 1973) as a secondary character in that comic&#x27;s &quot;Man-Thing&quot; feature. He graduated to his own backup feature in &quot;Giant-Size Man-Thing&quot; #4–5 (May and Aug. 1975), confronting such bizarre horror-parody characters as Garko the Man-Frog and Bessie the Hellcow, before acquiring his own comic book title with &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; #1 in 1976.
Gerber wrote 27 issues of the series (for the most part ditching the horror parodies), illustrated by a variety of artists, beginning with Frank Brunner. For Gerber, Howard was a flesh-and-blood duck and explained that &quot;If Wile E. Coyote gets run over by a steamroller, the result is a pancake-flat coyote who can be expected to snap back to three dimensions within moments; if Howard gets run over by a steamroller, the result is blood on asphalt.&quot; Gene Colan became the regular penciller with issue #4. Gerber later said to Colan: &quot;There really was almost a telepathic connection there. I would see something in my mind, and that is what you would draw! I&#x27;ve never had that experience with another artist before or since.&quot;

Sporting the slogan &quot;Get Down, America!&quot;, the All-Night Party was a fictional political party that appeared in Gerber&#x27;s &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; series during the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1976, and led to Howard the Duck allegedly receiving thousands of write-in votes in the actual election. Gerber addressed questions about the campaign in the letters column of the comic book and, as Mad Genius Associates, sold merchandise publicizing the campaign.

Marvel attempted a spin-off with a short-lived &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; newspaper comic strip from 1977 to 1978, at first written by Gerber and drawn by Colan and Mayerik, later written by Marv Wolfman and drawn by Alan Kupperberg.

Gerber gained a degree of creative autonomy when he became the comic series&#x27; editor in addition to his usual writing duties. With issue #16, unable to meet the deadline for his regular script, Gerber substituted an entire issue of text pieces and illustrations satirizing his own difficulties as a writer.

The Walt Disney Company contacted Marvel in 1977 over concerns that the visual design of Howard infringed on their trademark for Donald Duck. Marvel agreed to a redesign of the character by Disney artists. A key feature of the redesign was that the character would wear pants.

In 1978, Gerber was removed from the newspaper strip and the comic-book series due to chronic problems with deadlines. His final issue of the comic-book series was #27 (September 1978). The series continued for four more issues with stories by Marv Wolfman, Mary Skrenes, Mark Evanier, and Bill Mantlo.

The final episode of the newspaper strip was published on October 29, 1978. Issue #31 (May 1979) of the comic-book series announced on its letters page that it would be the final issue of &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; as a color comic. Marvel then relaunched the series that year as a bimonthly black and white magazine, with scripts by Mantlo, art by Colan and Michael Golden and unrelated backup features by others. The magazine was canceled after nine issues.

On August 29, 1980, after learning of Marvel&#x27;s efforts to license Howard for use in film and broadcast media, Steve Gerber filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Marvel corporate parent Cadence Industries and other parties, alleging that he was the sole owner of the character. This was one of the first highly publicized creator&#x27;s rights cases in American comics, and attracted support from major industry figures, some of whom created homage/parody stories with Gerber to fund a lawsuit against Marvel; these included &quot;Destroyer Duck&quot; with Jack Kirby. The lawsuit was settled on September 24, 1982, with Gerber acknowledging that his work on the character was done as work-for-hire and that Marvel parent Cadence Industries owned &quot;all right, title and interest&quot; to Howard the Duck and the Howard material he had produced. On November 5, 1982, Judge David Kenyon approved the motion and dismissed the case.

The only new story featuring the character between 1981 and 1986 appeared in &quot;Bizarre Adventures&quot; #34 (1983) Scripted by Steven Grant, it featured a suicidal Howard being put through a parody of &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;.

The original comic book series reappeared with issue #32 (January 1986). It featured a story that had been written by Grant four years earlier. Steve Gerber had submitted a script for the issue, but withdrew it after it had been revised to conform to editorial guidelines. Issue #33 (October 1986), scripted by Christopher Stager, featured a parody of the film &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;. Howard co-creator Val Mayerik co-plotted the story and provided the art. It was released alongside an adaptation of the &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; feature film, which was published in &quot;Marvel Super Special&quot; #41 (November 1986) and a three-issue comic-book series.

Gerber returned to Howard in 1989 in &quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot; #14–17. The character was again living with Beverly Switzler, now working as a rent-a-ninja. How they got back together was never explained. Beverly was not involved in the story, in which She-Hulk takes Howard on a trip through several dimensions with a theoretical physicist from Empire State University.

Gerber&#x27;s next story featuring Howard appeared in &quot;Spider-Man Team-Up&quot; #5 (December 1996), around the same time he was writing a &quot;Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck&quot; crossover for Image. He had the idea to create an unofficial crossover between the two issues, where the characters would meet momentarily in the shadows, but which would not affect either story. Soon after, Gerber discovered that Howard was scheduled to appear in &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; vol. 3, #81 (Jan. 1997) alongside Devil Dinosaur and Moon Boy, and issues of &quot;Generation X,&quot; as well as the three issue &quot;Daydreamers&quot; miniseries by J.M. DeMatteis. Gerber was not pleased with this development, and changed the &quot;unofficial crossover&quot; somewhat.

In &quot;Spider-Man Team-Up&quot; #5, Spider-Man, Beverly and Howard meet the Elf with a Gun and two shadowy figures (presumed to be Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck) in a darkened warehouse, grab a disc, then leave shortly afterwards. But in the &quot;Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck&quot; crossover comic, Elf with a Gun creates thousands of clones of Howard during a fierce battle. As Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck escape the warehouse, they reveal that they rescued the &quot;real&quot; Howard and Beverly, while Spider-Man left with one of the clones. Howard has his feathers dyed green, and is renamed &quot;Leonard the Duck&quot;, and Beverly has her hair dyed black and is renamed &quot;Rhonda Martini&quot;. Leonard later had a cameo appearance in &quot;Savage Dragon&quot; #41, and Leonard and Rhonda have a single-panel cameo when they meet Gerber&#x27;s Nevada in Vertigo Comics&#x27; &quot;Winter&#x27;s Edge&quot; #2.

In 2001, when Marvel launched its MAX imprint of &quot;mature readers&quot; comics, Gerber returned to write a six-issue &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; miniseries illustrated by Phil Winslade and Glenn Fabry. Featuring several familiar &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; characters, the series, like the original one, parodied a wide range of other comics and pop culture figures, but with considerably stronger language and sexual content than what would have been allowable 25 years earlier. The series has Doctor Bong causing Howard to go through multiple changes of form, principally into a mouse (as a parody of Mickey Mouse, in retaliation for the Disney-mandated redesign), and entering a chain of events parodying comics such as &quot;Witchblade&quot;, &quot;Preacher&quot; and several others, with Howard ultimately having a conversation with God in Hell.

Howard had cameo appearances in &quot;She-Hulk&quot; (vol. 2) #9 in February 2005 and in &quot;She-Hulk&quot; vol. 3 #3/#100 in February 2006 (issue #3 was also the numbered as the 100th total issue of all the various She-Hulk series). In 2007, he returned in &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; vol. 4 #1-4, a miniseries by writer Ty Templeton and artist Juan Bobillo. This series was rated for ages 9 and up, though one issue was published with a &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; tie-in cover with a parental advisory claim.

In November 2014, Marvel announced an ongoing series starting in March 2015 featuring Howard as a private investigator on Earth. The creative team consisted of writer Chip Zdarsky and artist Joe Quinones. &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; (vol. 5) ran for 5 issues before Marvel relaunched many of their existing titles with the All-New, All-Different Marvel line of comics. This led to a reboot produced by the same creative team starting with &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; (vol. 6) #1 in November 2015. This series included a two-part crossover with &quot;The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl&quot;. The 11th and last issue was released in October 2016.

==Fictional character biography==

Howard&#x27;s first appearance in comics is when he is abruptly abducted from his home planet by an unseen force and randomly dropped into the Florida Everglades by the demon-lord Thog the Nether-Spawn. He meets the Man-Thing, who had been attacked by Korrek of Katharta, and the three of them are confronted by warriors of the Congress of Realities. He then meets Dakimh the Enchanter and Dakimh banishes the warriors and transports Howard, Man-Thing, and Korrek to his castle, where they are joined by Jennifer Kale. They then travel to the realm of Therea and destroy Thog the Nether-Spawn. Howard then accidentally falls off the inter-dimensional stepping stones that the group were traveling on and materializes in Cleveland, Ohio, where he battles Garko the Man-Frog. Howard is arrested at this time for disturbing the peace and is mistaken for a mutant during a strip search, but is released because the police fear he has mutant abilities. Howard also briefly encounters and kills a vampiric cow named Bessie the Hellcow.

Howard makes friends with an artists&#x27; model named Beverly Switzler and a bizarre series of encounters follow. He battles Pro-Rata, the cosmic accountant, then meets Spider-Man at the end of the battle. He battles Turnip-Man and the Kidney Lady, who would become a semi-recurring character over the years, then learns the fictional martial art of &quot;Quack-Fu&quot;. Howard then encounters the Winky Man, who is actually the sleepwalking alter-ego of Beverly&#x27;s artist friend, Paul Same, who would become a series regular and later become the pair&#x27;s roommate. Howard also briefly becomes a wrestler.

Howard and Beverly hit the road, seeking shelter in a gothic mansion where they battle a girl named Patsy and her giant, animated-to-life gingerbread man. They eventually end up in New York City, where Howard is nominated for President of the United States by the All-Night Party and he later battles the Band of the Bland, alongside the Defenders. A doctored-photo scandal leads him to Canada where he defeats a supervillain, the Beaver, who caused the scandal. The Beaver falls to his death in a battle with Howard. Howard then suffers a nervous breakdown and flees Bev and their situation on a bus. Unfortunately, the bus&#x27; passengers are all believers in various weird cults, and try to interest Howard in them. His seatmates are Winda Wester and the Kidney Lady, a woman who believes that the soul of a person lives in their kidneys and attempts to stop anything she sees as &quot;anti-kidney health&quot;. After the bus crashes, Howard and Winda are sent to a mental institution. There he meets Daimon Hellstrom, and is briefly possessed by Hellstrom&#x27;s demonic soul, becoming the new Son of Satan. Beverly and Paul manage to get them both back to Cleveland. Later, while on the &quot;S. S. Damned&quot;, a cruise ship returning from scenic Bagmom, Howard and Beverly are taken captive by Lester Verde. Verde had known Beverly in college and had a crush on her and had assumed the identity of the supervillain Doctor Bong, who illegally marries Beverly against her will and transforms Howard into a human.

After escaping back to New York and being restored to his natural form, Howard is hired as a dishwasher by Beverly&#x27;s uncle, Lee Switzler. Howard is later reunited with Dakihm the Enchanter, the Man-Thing, Korrek and Jennifer Kale, and they all battle the demon Bzzk&#x27;Joh. Korrek pilots the ship the &quot;Epoch Weasel&quot; and drops Howard back off at Cleveland before he and their allies fly away. Howard finally meets up with the cruise ship that rescued Paul and Winda from Doctor Bong, and finds that Paul and Winda have befriended socialite Iris Raritan.

Howard is later kidnapped by the Ringmaster and his Circus of Crime. Winda is abandoned by Paul and Iris and Paul is shot and left in a coma. After defeating the Circus of Crime, Howard is plagued by pessimistic dreams and goes his way alone, just as he had at the series&#x27; beginning.

Writer Bill Mantlo, beginning with issue #30, returned the series to its former status quo, bringing Beverly back into the picture and having her divorce Doctor Bong. Howard&#x27;s creator Steve Gerber, who left the series after issue #27, originally intended for Beverly and Bong&#x27;s marriage to be lasting and for Beverly to be written out of the series from that point on. Howard and Beverly&#x27;s friend Paul, who had ended up in a coma after he had previously been shot by the Ringmaster, awakens from his coma and is released from the hospital. Beverly&#x27;s uncle Lee brings everyone back to Cleveland and employs Howard as a cab driver, while Paul, back to being a somnambulist after his release from the hospital, becomes Winda&#x27;s boyfriend. Howard dons a suit of &quot;Iron Duck&quot; armor made by Claude Starkowitz, a man who has delusions of being related to Tony Stark and dreams of being the personal armorer to Iron Man, and battles Doctor Bong in the final issue of the original 70s &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; series (issue #31). Howard later encounters Dracula and even once returns to Duckworld. At the end of the nine-issue magazine series, Howard leaves Beverly (at her request) and is later offered a genetically-constructed female duck mate, whom he does not take to.

On a later occasion, She-Hulk accidentally pulls Howard though a cosmic wormhole along with theoretical physicist Brent Wilcox and they are able to prevent other universes from crowding out Earth-616. During this time, Howard meets a character called the Critic, travels to a dimension known as the Baloneyverse and again battles a group called the Band of the Bland, whom he had previously battled with the Defenders.

In an encounter with Peter Parker and Ben Reilly (the then-current Spider-Man), Howard gets a rematch with the Circus of Crime and the Circus is defeated. During the fight, Howard and Beverly get stuck in a warehouse full of anthropomorphic ducks, briefly meeting the Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck. Parker and Reilly leave the warehouse believing that they have the correct versions of Howard and Beverly with them. However, in the Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck companion story that takes place simultaneously and that was written by Gerber, it is explained that the version of Howard and Beverly that left the warehouse with Parker and Reilly are simply clones taken by mistake and that the real Howard and Beverly actually left the scene with Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck.

The sorceress Jennifer Kale, in a weekly attempt to return Howard to his home world, inadvertently teleports Devil Dinosaur and Moon-Boy into her New York apartment. The disoriented dinosaur attempts to eat Howard, but spits him out when shot with Johnny Blaze&#x27;s hellfire gun. Devil Dinosaur and Moon-Boy then rampage through the city before being subdued by Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch). Howard says that he relates to the pair being trapped in a world they never made before wandering off.

===&quot;Heroes Reborn&quot;===
After a brief series of adventures with Generation X, Howard gets a job as a department store Santa Claus, which gets him dragged to the North Pole where the real Santa Claus has sold out to HYDRA. Howard goes through several dimensions, apparently through the power of Man-Thing, who can now talk but does not understand this new, unknown ability, and lands on a version of Duckworld where his parents are essentially Ward and June Cleaver, he has a sister named Princess, and he is regarded as a hero because his activities on Earth-616 were recognized by Duckworld&#x27;s version of Reed Richards. This origin traces the source of these dimensions to be projections from Franklin&#x27;s mind. Throughout the course of the adventure, Howard has a romance with Tana Nile, culminating in a kiss, after which he apologizes and tells her of his attachment to Beverly. When Franklin understands that he has shaped all of these worlds, the group finds themselves back in the Man-Thing&#x27;s swamp. While Man-Thing becomes a self-appointed guardian to Franklin Richards, Howard goes off on his own and is captured by the Cult of Entropy, who wrap him in swaddling clothes. Although last seen in the swamp, Howard states that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane. The cult wants Howard because he has part of the Nexus of All Realities, which shattered during &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot;, inside of him. Man-Thing then enters Howard&#x27;s mouth, and Howard vomits him back out with the fragment, but Man-Thing is left desiccated and practically dead. Howard then encounters Namor, who thought he had slain Man-Thing, but Howard explains that he would not be lugging his friend&#x27;s body around if that were the case. Howard sets the Man-Thing down in the water, and he revives during Howard&#x27;s conversation with Namor. Once he sees that the Man-Thing is alive and well, he bids Namor farewell and says that he is returning to Cleveland.

Years later, back with Beverly, he undergoes further shapeshifting experiences after an accident at a chemical facility of Doctor Bong&#x27;s. Beverly is hired by Bong&#x27;s Globally Branded Content Corporation, which manufactures boy bands from protein vats based on the sexual arousal of a focus group of gay men. Attempting to destroy an escapee whom Beverly has taken in, Bong inadvertently knocks Howard into a vat, which changes him, unstably, into a rat. When Howard later showers, he changes his form multiple times before again permanently returning to the form of the giant rat. Verde then goes to the press and claims that his building was attacked by Osama el-Barka (&quot;Osama the Duck&quot; in Arabic). Howard and Beverly are sent back on the road after the junkyard office where they are living is destroyed by a S.W.A.T. team. Denied admittance to every possible shelter due to lack of funds, the pair and their dog find a sign for the Boarding House of Mystery, but are taken to the police station for questioning and strip searches by Suzy Pazuzu, with whom Beverly had attended high school. One of the officers on the case is the same beat cop who mistook Howard for a mutant many years before. Suzy is the inheritor of the doucheblade, which starts to take her over when she wears an enchanted bracelet. In a skirmish, the bracelet is caught by Howard causing him to be the wielder of the doucheblade. The doucheblade causes its holder to grow enormous bare breasts and armor in a parody of Witchblade, and, possessed by this, Howard kills the male lover of a businessman who works with Verde as he and Verde break into Suzy&#x27;s house.

Arriving at the Boarding House of Mystery, Howard and Beverly encounter Cain and Abel, the latter with a rock stuck in his head that allows him only moments of lucidity. There, they are granted their every wish, including Howard&#x27;s return to his true form, and Beverly never being poor again, and meet parodies of John Constantine, Wesley Dodds, the Endless, Spider Jerusalem, and Gerber&#x27;s own Nevada (called Utah), all characters from DC Comics&#x27; Vertigo imprint. The downside to the House is that everyone staying there gets their every wish; so Che Guevara can have his revolution, but someone else can easily slaughter him. One tenant, a writer named Mr. Gommorah (a parody of Spider Jerusalem), later takes Beverly and Howard to be on the &quot;Iprah&quot; show with the topic &quot;Why Women Give It to Men Who Don&#x27;t Get It&quot;, guest starring Dr. Phlip.

Upon leaving the House of Mystery, Howard is once again transformed into an anthropomorphic mouse. It is revealed that Iprah has been merged with an experiment by the Angel Gabriel called Deuteronomy, intended to replace God, because God has been spending all his time in a bar in Hell since 1938. Deuteronomy is a creature half-id and half-superego, while Iprah is an all-ego promoter of self-indulgent pop psychology. Considering her dangerous, Gabriel sends the cherub Thrasher to resurrect Sigmund Freud, whose cigar blasts out half of Thrasher&#x27;s brains (being immortal, this just makes him act drunk). Iprah destroys Freud, but Howard blasts her with the cigar, separating her from Deuteronomy. Puffing on the cigar, Howard disintegrates and arrives in Hell. He is eventually freed by Yah, a being who claims to be &quot;God&quot;.

===&quot;Civil War&quot;===
Sometime later, Howard attempts to register under the Superhero Registration Act during the superhero Civil War, but learns his socially disrupted life has created so many bureaucratic headaches that the government&#x27;s official policy is that Howard does not exist. This lack of government oversight delights him: &quot;For the rest of my life, no more parking tickets, or taxes, or jury duty. Heck, I couldn&#x27;t even vote if I wanted to!&quot; In this story, Howard says he was pressured to give up his cigars.

After he defeats the supervillain M.O.D.O.T.&#x27;s (Mobile Organism Designed Only for Talking) scheme to control the public through mass media, his attorney, Jennifer Walters, successfully restores his citizenship, including all relevant responsibilities.

===&quot;Secret Invasion&quot;===
Howard the Duck is briefly seen as part of the superpowered army gathered to battle invading Skrull forces. He is seen armed with a pistol and wearing a Skrull&#x27;s hand around his neck. He is later seen kicking a Skrull during interrogation after the invasion. Brian Michael Bendis has commented when asked of Howard: &quot;That character has shown up in six issues I&#x27;ve done, and I&#x27;ve never typed the words Howard the Duck.&quot;

===&quot;Marvel Zombies 5&quot;===

In &quot;Marvel Zombies 5&quot;, Howard the Duck of Earth-616 teams up with Machine Man to travel across the multiverse fighting zombies.

===&quot;Fear Itself&quot;===
During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Howard forms a team called the Fearsome Four with She-Hulk, Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster and Nighthawk to stop the Man-Thing when he goes on a rampage in Manhattan, due to the fear and chaos he senses on the citizens. They later discover a plot by Psycho-Man to use the Man-Thing&#x27;s volatile empathy to create a weapon.

===&quot;Spider-Man: Back in Quack&quot;===
Howard and Beverly are brainwashed and forced to work for Save Our Offspring From Indecency (S.O.O.F.I.) as Cynical Duck and Swizzle. They promote S.O.O.F.I. at a public speech held for them by J. Jonah Jameson. Spider-Man later interrupts a S.O.O.F.I. indoctrination at the New York Public Library, and Beverly and the other S.O.O.F.I.s see Spidey as a semi-demonic figure and attack him. Spidey escapes with Howard and breaks his brainwashing when Beverly is threatened. Howard quickly explains S.O.O.F.I.&#x27;s goals to Spider-Man. As Spider-Man publicly announces his long-standing support for S.O.O.F.I., Howard confronts Bev as she stands beside the Supreme S.O.O.F.I. Howard is able to break through to Beverly, reminding her of their past together. The Supreme S.O.O.F.I. orders the S.O.O.F.I.s to throw the pair into the special Blanditron at Guantanamo Bay, but Beverly keeps them at bay with a whip. Spidey attacks the S.O.O.F.I.s and unmasks the Supreme S.O.O.F.I., while the others escape through their teleporter. Howard states that he believes S.O.O.F.I. will lay low for a while after such a defeat and he also hopes that the group&#x27;s Florida Everglades base might lead them to meet up with the Man-Thing.

===The Ducky Dozen===
Because of his experience with zombie-infested worlds and his leadership of Machine Man, Howard is chosen as the leader of, as he dubs them, the Ducky Dozen. The team is composed of him, several Golden Age heroes, Dum-Dum Dugan, and Battlestar, who is also a veteran of a zombie incident. Upon entering Earth-12591, the Ducky Dozen fight hordes of zombie Nazis and Asgardians, but suffer grave losses as the team&#x27;s members are either killed or zombified during the battle. After successfully accomplishing their mission, Howard, Dugan, Taxi Taylor and Battlestar are the only members to survive and return to Earth-616 along with the Riveter, the only survivor of Earth-12591&#x27;s resistance team, the Suffragists.

===&quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot;===
Howard later teams up with his friend Doop to battle the Robo-Barbarians in Dimension ZZZ. They beat the horde back with nothing but a broken sword, a rubber chicken with nails in it and a gun that shoots bees.

===&quot;Original Sin&quot;===
After the death of Uatu the Watcher and the activation of the secrets buried in his eye, Howard discovers that he has the potential to be the most intelligent being in Duckworld. After evading a squirrel while driving, he is thrown flying from his vehicle but uses his intellect to calculate a way to land safely in a nearby dumpster.

===Back to New York===
Howard returns to his business as a private eye, working in the same building as She-Hulk, in Brooklyn. One of his first new clients is Jonathan Richards, who hires Howard to retrieve a necklace stolen by the Black Cat. With the help of Tara Tam, his new friend and assistant, Howard manages to recover the necklace. However, on his way to give it back to Richards, he finds himself kidnapped by the Collector and allied with the Guardians of the Galaxy to escape the villain, who was attempting to add Howard to his collection of rare space objects and entities. Upon returning to Earth, Howard is robbed by May Parker, Spider-Man&#x27;s aunt, and later re-encounters the Ringmaster, who is revealed to have brainwashed the elderly into committing robberies. After recovering the necklace for a third time, Howard is approached by Richards in the middle of his fight against the Ringmaster and Richards reveals himself to be Talos the Untamed, who reveals that the necklace was part of a marginally powerful item known as the Abundant Glove. With help from Doctor Strange, Howard and Tara locate the final piece of the Abundant Glove, but are unable to put it back together when Talos grabs it and proceeds to use it to wreak havoc on the city. Talos is confronted by numerous heroes while Howard and Tara take cover. Howard is able to point out that Tara, who is revealed to possess shapeshifting powers similar to that of a Skrull, could help him defeat Talos. Tara used her powers to impersonate Skrull Emperor Kl&#x27;rt (the Super-Skrull), distracting Talos long enough for Howard to snatch the Abundant Glove from his hand. Talos is later apprehended by the Fantastic Four and everything returns to normal.

Afterwards, with the help of new arrival Gwenpool, Howard prevented HYDRA from infecting the world with a deadly virus. Actress Lea Thompson hires Howard to discover why she has been having memory lapses and dreams about a &quot;duck man&quot; similar to him, and the investigation discovered Mojo had been broadcasting Howard&#x27;s adventures as a reality show, and to fill in the gaps on his life, Mojo filmed footage of a small alien in a duck costume interacting with Thompson performing as Switzler (referencing the 1986 film adaptation of Howard). He also has a crossover event with &quot;The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl&quot;. Howard the Duck is shown to be living in the She-Hulk&#x27;s apartment building when Patsy Walker moved out.

===&quot;Civil War II&quot;===
During the &quot;Civil War II&quot; storyline, Howard the Duck is among the building tenants that learn from Patsy Walker what happened to She-Hulk following the fight against Thanos.

===&quot;War of the Realms&quot;===
Howard&#x27;s last name of Duckson is revealed in &quot;War of the Realms&quot;: &quot;War Scrolls&quot; #1.

Howard the Duck later attempted to pose as a spider variant of himself called the Spectacular Spider-Duck in the building where the Great Web of Life of Destiny is only for Spider-Boy to ask if that is an actual variant or the real Howard the Duck posing as a variant in order to mooch off their food. Lady Araña throws Howard the Duck out of the building. After tossing his Spider-Man outfit into the garbage can, Howard the Duck leaves stating that it was worth the shot.

==Powers and abilities==
Howard has no superhuman powers, but is skilled in the martial art known as Quak-Fu, enough to defeat, or at least to hold his own against, far larger opponents. He has shown some degree of mystic talent in the past, to the point that Stephen Strange taught some spells to Howard and even offered to train him, but Howard declined.

On one occasion, Howard used a suit of powered armor known as the &quot;Iron Duck&quot;, designed by Claude Starkowitz. Besides its property as body armor, the suit was equipped with foot-mounted leaping coils, a chest-mounted searchlight, and arm-mounted flamethrowers.

==Characteristics and associations==

Howard the Duck is a three-foot-tall anthropomorphic duck. He generally wears a tie and shirt and is almost always found smoking a cigar. Originally, like many cartoon ducks, he wore no pants; Disney threatened legal action due to Howard&#x27;s resemblance to Donald Duck, and Marvel redesigned that aspect of the character by writing into the script that Howard was the target of anti-nudity protests, and was forced to do business with &quot;Wally Sidney&quot;, a failed cartoonist who made his fortune through a chain of conservative clothing retailers known as &quot;Sidney World&quot;. Howard tries on various outfits, including ones akin to Donald Duck&#x27;s sailor uniform and Uncle Scrooge&#x27;s coat and top hat, before settling on his new attire of a business suit complete with trousers. Although Howard sulks that he has lost, Beverly reassures him that she does not want him to be a victim of a mob, and loves him no matter what he wears.

Howard has an irritable and cynical attitude towards the often bizarre events around him; he feels there is nothing special about him except that he is a duck, and though he has no goals other than seeking comfort and to be left alone, he is often dragged into dangerous adventures simply because he is visibly unusual. His series&#x27; tagline, &quot;Trapped in a world he never made&quot;, played off the genre trappings of 1950s science fiction.

His near-constant companion and occasional girlfriend is former art model and Cleveland native Beverly Switzler. Like Howard, Beverly wants an ordinary life but is frequently singled out for her appearance, though as a beautiful woman rather than a duck. His other friends include Paul Same (a painter who briefly became a sleepwalking crime-fighter named the Winky Man), Winda Wester (a lisping ingénue with psychic powers), and country music singer Dreyfus Gultch. Howard has worked with Spider-Man and the Man-Thing on various occasions.

Howard found himself on Earth due to a shift in the &quot;Cosmic Axis&quot; from a world similar to Earth, but where there are &quot;more ducks&quot; and &quot;apes don&#x27;t talk.&quot; In the black-and-white &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; magazine series, writer Bill Mantlo theorized that Howard came from an extra-dimensional planet called Duckworld, a planet similar to Earth where ducks, not apes, had evolved to become the dominant species. In 2001, Gerber dismissed this idea, calling it &quot;very pedestrian&quot; and &#x27;comic-booky&#x27; — in the worst sense of the term.&quot; Gerber stated that Howard came from an alternate Earth populated by a variety of anthropomorphic animals and not Duckworld. A panel in &quot;Fear&quot; #19, prior to Howard&#x27;s introduction, depicts Howard or someone like him near an anthropomorphic mouse and an anthropomorphic dog, in a panel about hypothetical other dimensions. Gerber later depicted his character Destroyer Duck as existing in such a world.

His antagonists (who usually appear in a single story each) are often parodies of science fiction, fantasy, or horror characters, as well as frequent parodies of political figures and organizations. The chief recurring villain, Lester Verde, better known as Doctor Bong – modeled on Doctor Doom and writers Bob Greene and Lester Bangs – is a former tabloid reporter who has the power to &quot;reorder reality&quot; by smashing himself on the bell-shaped helmet on his head and his main goal is to marry Beverly. Beverly eventually agreed to marry him to save Howard from Bong&#x27;s evil experimentation, but the two were divorced shortly thereafter. Doctor Bong would reappear in issues of &quot;She-Hulk&quot; and &quot;Deadpool&quot; in the mid-1990s. Other recurring villains include the Kidney Lady, an older woman who has been convinced by her former lover that the soul is in the kidneys and attacks anything she sees as a threat to them, and Reverend Jun Moon Yuc and his Yuccies, a parody of Reverend Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church (&quot;Moonies&quot;). Another important villain was the organization S.O.O.F.I. (Save Our Offspring From Indecency), whose leader was implied to be Anita Bryant, though she looked like an old, fat Elvis Presley with a smiley face/orange on her head.

Other Marvel Comics characters occasionally appeared with Howard, including Spider-Man, the Son of Satan and the Ringmaster. Omega the Unknown appeared to him in a dream, as did Spider-Man and the founding members of the rock group Kiss on other occasions.

Seemingly an autodidact, Howard at various times references Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Albert Camus (whose novel &quot;The Stranger&quot; Gerber considers the principal influence on the comic series), the Brontë sisters, and other figures of philosophical and political significance. In a parody of the Marvel comic character Shang-Chi, Howard was trained in the martial art of Quak-Fu. In the 2001 miniseries, as a mocking gesture toward Disney&#x27;s mascot Mickey Mouse and as a reference to a previous lawsuit with the company over Howard&#x27;s similarity to Donald Duck, Howard was turned into various other animals, but primarily appeared in the series as an anthropomorphic mouse.

==Other versions==

===Legion of Howards===
In a parody of the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; event, Howard and Leo Fitz team up with a group of Howards from across the Multiverse who collectively call themselves the Legion of Howards. Their ranks include:

In the miniseries &quot;Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars&quot;, a billboard advertising for &quot;HDTV&quot; is seen in the first panel, showing Howard.

===&quot;Universe X&quot;===
* While Howard does not appear, the Beast says &quot;I still feel badly about Howard,&quot; who had been &quot;hunted down and consumed.&quot;
* In the original draft for &quot;Earth X&quot;, Howard was supposedly served as a feast during the Skrull&#x27;s invasion of New York City. The scene was cut due to space constraints.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Howard the Duck makes a cameo appearance in the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; episode &quot;Awesome&quot;, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. This version is contained in a lab on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.
** Additionally, an alternate reality pirate version of Howard appears in the episode &quot;Return to the Spider-Verse&quot; Pt. 2, voiced by Seth Green. This version is a member of Captain Web Beard&#x27;s crew.
* Howard the Duck makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the &quot;Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.&quot; episode &quot;The Collector&quot; as one of the eponymous character&#x27;s prisoners.
* Howard the Duck appears in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; (2015), voiced again by Seth Green. This version is an old acquaintance of Rocket Raccoon.
* Hulu intended to air a &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; animated series, written and executive produced by Kevin Smith and Dave Willis, that would have led up to a crossover special involving MODOK, Hit-Monkey, Tigra, and Dazzler called &quot;The Offenders&quot;. However, in January 2020, it was announced that the &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; series was cancelled.

===Film===

Howard the Duck appears in a self-titled film, voiced by Chip Zien and portrayed by stunt actors Peter Baird, Ed Gale, Jordan Prentice, Tim Rose, Steve Sleap, Lisa Sturz, and Mary Wells. This version was transported to Earth following a laser spectroscope experiment gone awry.

===Marvel Cinematic Universe===

Howard the Duck makes cameo appearances in media set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, voiced by Seth Green.
* Howard first appears in the live-action film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, as a living exhibit in the Collector&#x27;s museum on Knowhere before the Collector&#x27;s slave Carina uses the Power Stone to cause an explosion that kills her and frees the Collector&#x27;s imprisoned creatures. In a post-credits scene, Howard has a drink with the Collector and Cosmo amidst the wreckage. In August 2014, &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; director James Gunn said, &quot;It&#x27;s possible Howard could reappear as more of a character in the Marvel [Cinematic] Universe. But if people think that&#x27;s going to lead to a &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; movie, that&#x27;s probably not going to happen in the next four years. Who knows after that?&quot; 
* Howard makes appearances in the live-action films &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot;. He was also meant to make a cameo appearance in the live-action film &quot;&quot;. While the scene was cut, Howard was confirmed to have survived the Blip.
* Alternate timeline variants of Howard appear in the Disney+ animated series &quot;What If...?&quot;, voiced again by Green.
* Plans have also occurred for Howard to star in his own film. In 2016, Rob Zombie claimed that he had pitched a &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; film to Marvel, but was turned down. After a rumor in June 2017 incorrectly stated that Marvel Studios was developing a film based Howard that would involve Gunn as a producer, Gunn himself confirmed later that September that a film for the character was not being made. In June 2018, Lea Thompson revealed that she was preparing to meet with Marvel Studios about her pitch for a new Howard the Duck film she wanted to direct after starring in the 1986 film as Beverly Switzler. Thompson had developed the pitch to be set in the MCU and worked on it &quot;for a really long time&quot; with modern Howard the Duck comic book writers Chip Zdarsky and Joe Quinones, who had included her as a character in one of their comic runs. That September, Thompson said Marvel Studios loved her pitch but told her they had no plans for a Howard the Duck film and that they would contact her again following the development of their MCU television series on Disney+. Thompson expressed further interest in directing an MCU reboot for the character following his appearances in &quot;What If...?&quot;.

===Other comics===
* In &quot;Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck&quot; #1 (Nov. 1996), Gerber claims that Howard and Beverly Switzler changed their names to Leonard the Duck and Rhonda Martini, remained in the Image Comics Universe, and &quot;were last sighted in Chicago boarding the Amtrak for Buffalo&quot; while the duck who returned to Marvel is &quot;only an empty trademark, a clone whose soul departed him at the corner of Floss and Regret.&quot; This was done because Tom Brevoort invited Gerber to write the comic, claiming he was the only one to write Howard, then Gerber noticed the Howard guest appearances in &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; and &quot;Generation X&quot; and felt as though he had been tricked.
* In the Don Simpson&#x27;s &quot;Megaton Man&quot; feature, a comedy relief character is Gower Goose, an intended parody of Howard.
* In the Claypool Comics series &quot;Elvira Mistress of the Dark&quot;, Gordon the Goose (clearly modelled on Howard) appears, together with Dorkheem the Sorcerer and the Heap-Thing, in issues #49, 58, and 59.
* In America&#x27;s Best Comics&#x27; &quot;Top 10&quot; #8, a duck appearing to be Howard (with his distinctive blue hat &amp; jacket) can be seen at the Transworld Transport Terminus.
* In several issues of &quot;The Maxx&quot;, Howard appears, along with many other characters, seemingly cut and pasted into the story.
* In Adam Beechen&#x27;s ending of &quot;Doctor Fate: More Pain Comics&quot;, which Gerber left unfinished when he died, Howard, who is heard but unseen (his speech balloon ends with &quot;waaugh&quot;), dispatched the Elf with a Gun to destroy Negal and Ymp, then invited for one last drink with Yah, Bev, Thunny, and Megs before Yah goes back &quot;upstairs&quot;.
* He is also seen being roasted in one of the &quot;Deadpool Kills The Marvel Universe&quot; issues, where the reporter states that Deadpool has gone into a killing spree, looking for heroes and villains alike, and also some characters that were never too special to begin with.

===Newspaper comic strip===
Between June 6, 1977 and October 29, 1978, Howard the Duck appeared in a syndicated daily comic strip that comic strip historian Allan Holtz has described as having low distribution and that was eventually replaced by the &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; comic strip. The strip was syndicated in almost 70 newspapers (by the Register and Tribune Syndicate), including the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and &quot;Spokane Daily Chronicle&quot;. When the strip was dropped by the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot;, a Cleveland TV station began televising the strip for two minutes each night.

A total of eleven story arcs, as well as a number of single-joke strips, constitute the 511 individual strips that were printed.

The strip started with original stories written by Steve Gerber and illustrated by Gene Colan: &quot;Pop Syke -- The Consciousness of Success&quot;, &quot;The Cult of Entropy&quot; and &quot;Fred Feenix the Self-Made Man&quot;. The latter was started by Colan and completed by Val Mayerik, who stayed on to do two additional Gerber-scripted stories: &quot;The Sleigh Jacking&quot; and &quot;In Search of the Good Life&quot;.

These were followed by an adaptation of the &quot;Sleep of the Just&quot; story from issue #4 of the Marvel comic, scripted by Gerber and illustrated by Alan Kupperberg. Gerber was fired from the strip in early 1978 over chronic problems with deadlines. He was replaced by Marv Wolfman as writer, while Alan Kupperberg continued as artist. The remaining stories were: &quot;Close Encounters of the Fowl Kind&quot;, &quot;The Tuesday Ruby&quot;, &quot;The Clone Ranger&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye, Beverly&quot; and &quot;The Mystery of the Maltese Human&quot;. As the series drew to an end, its already meager list of client papers shrank, making copies of these last post-Gerber stories particularly hard to find.

In November 1978, the first of a projected eight-issue series reprinting the entire strip was published by John Zawadzki. Titled &quot;It&#x27;s Adventure Time With...Howard the Duck&quot;, only the initial issue was published.

==Reception==
Michael Burkett of the Orange County Register described Howard the Duck as a &quot;cantankerous, stogie-chomping, nattily dressed&quot; antihero with an &quot;acerbic wit, irascible personality and down-and-dirty street smarts&quot; that distinguished him from other cartoon animal characters. Burkett likened Howard to &quot;Donald Duck cross-bred with Groucho Marx and Jean-Paul Sartre.&quot; He wrote that Howard&#x27;s &quot;cult-worshipped&quot; 1970s comic book series brought the &quot;surrealism, social commentary, political satire and what-the-hell-am-I-doing-here philosophy&quot; of 1960s &quot;underground comics&quot; into the mainstream. The New Yorker said Howard believed in &quot;mainstream social Darwinism&quot; and was &quot;a web-footed Eric Hoffer&quot;. Kenneth Turan of The Washington Post called Howard &quot;an Everyman with feathers, forever shooting his mouth off, battling a gloomy reality.&quot;

Marvel editor-in-chief Roy Thomas thought that Howard, as a &quot;funny animal&quot; character, was inappropriate for the horror comic book in which he was introduced. He told Gerber to dispose of the character &quot;as fast as you can.&quot; After Gerber showed Howard seemingly dying by falling into a void, Marvel&#x27;s &quot;office was flooded with letters&quot; of protest. One fan even sent in a duck carcass to make his point. At San Diego Comic-Con, the auditorium stood up and applauded when a fan asked Thomas if Howard would ever come back. Marvel responded by bringing Howard back for more appearances and soon launching his own self-titled comic book series.

&quot;Howard the Duck&quot; #1 &quot;was the best-selling book Marvel ever had (that wasn&#x27;t based on a movie)&quot; according to artist Frank Brunner. The debut issue of his series instantly became a target of speculators and &quot;occasionally sold for as much as $25.&quot; Comic-book dealer Jim Kovacs said he followed a delivery truck on the day of its release and &quot;bought 900 copies right off the newsstands.&quot; Marvel&#x27;s circulation director Ed Shukin said he &quot;underestimated&quot; demand, only printing 275,000 copies, the minimum amount allowed at the time. By December 1977, the issue was selling for an average price of $12.50, which comic book price guide publisher Robert Overstreet described as &quot;the most phenomenal growth of any comic book that has been published.&quot; Gerber was angry about the hoarding situation, &quot;I felt as if the book had been sabotaged by the very people who supposedly liked the character.&quot; He suspected that the lack of availability of issue #1 eventually led to lower sales on the entire series. Howard&#x27;s first issue has been cited as &quot;the first big speculative book in the collectors market&quot; for comic books.

The &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; comic book has been described as &quot;the first successful title aimed at an older audience.&quot; Former Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter said that Howard &quot;had developed some cult favorite status that extended as far as Hollywood.&quot; During post-production on &quot;Star Wars&quot;, George Lucas showed issue #1 to his friends and collaborators Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, telling them, &quot;this would make a great movie.&quot; Gerber was surprised at how quickly the character attracted mainstream media attention. He was contacted for interviews by &quot;New York&quot; magazine, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and others.

&quot;Precious&quot;, a song written by Chrissie Hynde for The Pretenders&#x27; first album, features the lyric &quot;Now Howard the Duck and Mr. Stress both stayed / Trapped in a world they never made&quot;. According to lead guitarist James Honeyman-Scott, quoted in &quot;Beat&quot; magazine, &quot;Chrissie used to read &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; comic books and then she introduced Howard to [bassist] Pete [Farndon] and Pete was well over the top on it. He&#x27;s got every &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; comic ever.&quot;

After Gerber parted ways with Marvel in 1978 amid numerous legal and creative disputes, and other writers took over for him, Howard the Duck&#x27;s popularity diminished rapidly. Stan Lee, Shooter and Gerber himself criticized the post-Gerber stories for their lack of substance and clever humor. Within three years of Gerber&#x27;s departure, Marvel had ceased publishing new Howard the Duck material. Lucasfilm&#x27;s big-budget 1986 &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; film disappointed critics, audiences and the character&#x27;s fans alike. Although Marvel has occasionally released new Howard comic books, some written by Gerber, and sometimes features the character in other media, Howard&#x27;s popularity has never again approached what it was in the 1970s.

In August 2009, &quot;Time&quot; listed Howard the Duck as one of the &quot;Top 10 Oddest Marvel Characters&quot;.

<doc id="462674" wikidata="Q3001117" url="?curid=462674" title="New Hampshire Supreme Court">
<text>The New Hampshire Supreme Court is the supreme court of the U.S. state of New Hampshire and sole appellate court of the state. The Supreme Court is seated in the state capital, Concord. The Court is composed of a Chief Justice and four Associate Justices appointed by the Governor and Executive Council to serve during &quot;good behavior&quot; until retirement or the age of seventy. The senior member of the Court is able to specially assign lower-court judges, as well as retired justices, to fill vacancies on the Court.

The Supreme Court is the administrative authority over the state&#x27;s judicial system. The Court has both mandatory and discretionary appellate jurisdiction. In 2000, the Court created a &quot;Three Judges Expedited&quot; or 3JX panel to issue decisions in cases of less precedential value, with its decision only binding on the present case. In 2004, the court began accepting all appeals from the trial courts for the first time in 25 years.

From 1776 to 1876, the then four-member court was known as the &quot;Superior Court of Judicature&quot;, until the name was changed by an act of the New Hampshire General Court. In 1901, the number of justices was increased from four to five. Two Supreme Court justices have been the only two state officials to be impeached in New Hampshire: Justice Woodbury Langdon resigned prior to his trial in 1790, and Chief Justice David Brock was acquitted by the New Hampshire Senate in 2000.

Retired Associate Justice David Souter of the Supreme Court of the United States served on the New Hampshire Supreme Court from 1983 to 1990.

==History==
The Colony of New Hampshire adopted the temporary . The newly formed legislature abolished the existing executive courts made up of the governor and council, and established the &quot;Superior Court of Judicature&quot; as the appellate court with four justices. The Court follows the common law and since &quot;Tomson v. Ward&quot; (1816) has published official law reports of its precedential opinions. In 1876, an act was passed creating the &quot;Supreme Court&quot; as New Hampshire&#x27;s highest court.

In 1901, the legislature established two courts to take the place of the existing Supreme Court. Jurisdiction over &quot;law terms&quot; during which court decisions were appealed, was given to the Supreme Court, which was made up of a chief justice and four associate justices. Matters formerly handled at &quot;trial terms&quot; were given to the Superior Court. The advantage was a separate appeals court, of which the trial judge was not a member.

In 1966, the state constitution was amended to establish the Supreme Court and Superior Court as constitutional courts, which means that they could only be changed or abolished by a constitutional amendment, not by the legislature.

In 1971, the General Court established by statute a &quot;Unified Court System,&quot; making the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court responsible for the efficient operation of all the courts in New Hampshire. The law stated the Supreme Court Chief Justice will have the advice and consent of the Chief Justice of the Superior Court. It also required both to seek cooperation from others interested in the administration of justice including other justices and judges, court clerks, the court accreditation committee, the state and local bar associations, and the judicial council. The 24-member Judicial Council is an ongoing, independent forum for consideration and discussion of issues involving the administration of justice.

In 1978, New Hampshire voters approved the addition of Part II, Article 73-a, a constitution amendment to the constitution making the Chief Justice the administrative head of the court and giving the Judicial Branch greater control over itself.

In 1983, the General Courts consolidated funding for all the state courts into the state&#x27;s biennial budget. This abolished the prior practice of the superior and probate courts funded by the counties and the district courts by the cities and towns in which they were located. The Office of Administrative Services, now known as the Administrative Office of the Courts, was established. The office consolidated functions such as personnel, accounting, technology and budgeting into one central office for the Judicial Branch.

In May 2000, the Supreme Court announced the creation of a new Judicial Conduct Commission (JCC) that would be totally independent of the court system and have its own staff, office space, and funding. The Judicial Conduct Commission took the place of the prior Judicial Conduct Committee, which the court had created in 1977. In 2004, RSA Chapter 494-A came into effect codified the JCC as being completely independent of the New Hampshire court system and other branches of government. The legislature effectively left the rules the JCC intact, except where they contradicted the RSA Chapter 494-A. The Supreme Court took an appeal, Petition of the Judicial Conduct Commission (2004), from the JCC that RSA chapter 494-A was unconstitutional because it purported to authorize the JCC to impose disciplinary action on judges. The court ruled that the legislature had violated the separation of powers doctrine (Part I, Article 37) by encroaching on the power of the Supreme Court to regulate the conduct of the judiciary, by giving such power to the commission.

==Jurisdiction==

The court hears a variety of cases, most of which are either mandatory or discretionary appeals from the lower courts. In January 2004, the court began accepting all appeals from the trial court for the first time in 25 years. Below, fiscal year caseload statistics are shown for the Family Divisions, District Courts, Probate Courts and the Superior Courts in the 2003 and 2004 fiscal years show this change.

===Mandatory appeals===
The Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review appeals from the State trial courts and from many State administrative agencies. For many years, the Court did not accept every appeal from the lower courts. In 2003, the court only accepted 40 percent of the appeals. In January 2004, the Supreme Court instituted mandatory appeals on the final decisions on the merits from the Family Division and the District, Probate and Superior Courts, under Supreme Court Rule 7. In mandatory appeals, the parties generally are given the opportunity to submit a transcript of the lower court proceedings and to file written briefs. After the briefs are filed, the Supreme Court decides if the case will be decided after oral argument or on the briefs alone. The court will then issue a final decision in the form of a brief order, an order with some explanation, or a full written opinion.

===Discretionary appeals and original jurisdiction===
Conditions which make the aforementioned appeals discretionary are: a post-conviction review proceeding; a proceeding involving the collateral challenge to a conviction or sentence; a sentence modification or suspension proceeding; an imposition of sentence proceeding; a parole revocation proceeding; or a probation revocation proceeding. On September 7, 2005, the Supreme Court adopted a temporary addition to the exceptions to mandatory appeals, adding appeals from a final decision on the merits issued in a landlord/tenant action or in a possessory action, both under RSA Chapter 540. Administrative appeals, interlocutory appeals and interlocutory transfers, and certain limited appeals from the decisions of the trial courts are also discretionary appeals. The court also has original jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari, prohibition, habeas corpus and other writs, which the court has discretion to decide which cases to hear. If a discretionary appeal is accepted, it typically follows the same process as a mandatory appeal.

===Three Judges Expedited (3JX)===
In December 2000, the Supreme Court instituted a Three Judges Expedited (3JX) summary procedure to reduce cases requiring oral argument. The 3JX panel consists of three justices who hear shortened arguments of cases containing less precedential value. A unanimous judgement of all three justices is necessary for the panel to issue an Order binding only the present case, it contains no precedential value. A split decision of the 3JX panel will cause a case to be rescheduled for oral argument in front of all five justices.

==Organization==
The court is made up of a chief justice and four associate justices. Currently the members of the court are Chief Justice Gordon J. MacDonald, Associate Justice James P. Bassett, Associate Justice Anna Hantz Marconi, Associate Justice Patrick E. Donovan, and Associate Justice Melissa Beth Countway.

===Appointment===
Part II, Article 46 of the state constitution, states all judicial officers (among the other constitutional officers) shall be nominated and appointed by the Governor and Executive Council. It also states that such nominations shall be made at least three days prior to such appointment and no such appointment shall take place unless a majority of the council agrees.

===Length of tenure===
Part II, Article 73 of the state constitution states all judicial officers shall hold their offices during good behavior, unless the constitution states otherwise. Part II, Article 78 limits judges of any court from holding court once that judge has reached the age of seventy years.

===Assigning replacement justices===
According to RSA 490:3, when a justice of the Supreme Court has retired, is disqualified, or is unable to sit on a case, the chief justice or senior associate justice of the supreme court may assign a justice of the supreme court who has retired from regular active service. If a retired supreme court justice is unavailable, a justice of the superior court who has retired from regular active service shall be continuously assigned to fill a vacancy. The selection of a retired supreme or superior court justice shall be on a random basis. However, if neither a retired supreme or superior court justice is available, then the selection of a replacement justice shall be made on a random basis from a pool of full-time justices of the superior court, then from a pool of full-time justices of the district and probate courts.

Justices assigned to sit temporarily on the Supreme Court have all the authority of a Supreme Court justice to hear arguments, render decisions and file opinions. However, no justice shall be assigned to sit on the Supreme Court in the determination of any cause or matter upon which the justice has previously sat or for which such justice is not otherwise disqualified nor without the justice&#x27;s own consent.

==Current justices==


==Impeachment of justices==

The state constitution provides two methods for removing judicial officers, based on who is bringing such action:
*Part II, Article 73 also states that the Governor with consent of the Executive Council may remove any commissioned officer for reasonable cause upon the address of both houses of the legislature; that the cause for removal shall be stated fully and substantially in the address and shall not be a cause which is a sufficient ground for impeachment; and provided further that no officer shall be so removed unless he shall have had an opportunity to be heard in his defense by a joint committee of both houses of the legislature.
*Part II, Article 17 states, &quot;The house of representatives shall be the grand inquest of the state; and all impeachments made by them, shall be heard and tried by the senate.&quot; Part II, Article 38 provides the grounds for impeachment as bribery, corruption, malpractice or maladministration. The article also provides the framework and requirements for how the Senate will conduct such an impeachment trial.

===Justice Woodbury Langdon in 1790===
In 1790, the first impeachment trial of a Supreme Court justice was commenced against Judge Woodbury Langdon from Portsmouth, a brother of Governor John Langdon. The House of Representatives voted 35–29 to impeach him for neglecting his duties; finding that he had failed to attend sessions of the Supreme Court in outlying counties and that charging the legislature had failed to provide an honorable salaries for judges and interfered in court decisions. The removal trial in the Senate was postponed, but never took place as Woodbury resigned from the court.

===Chief Justice David A. Brock in 2000===
On March 31, 2000, State Attorney General Philip T. McLaughlin issued a report entitled &quot;In re: W. Stephen Thayer, III and Related Matters,&quot; which brought to light information raising concerns about the conduct of justices of the Supreme Court. The key to the investigation was an unsigned memo, attributed to Supreme Court Clerk Howard Zibel, which was delivered to the Attorney General by Brock&#x27;s personal lawyer. The Zibel memo detailed ethical violations by members of the Supreme Court witnessed by the author; which surrounded the conduct of Justice W. Steven T. Thayer III in the Feld&#x27;s Case and the appeal of Thayer v. Thayer (his own divorce) and resulted in the criminal investigation of Thayer, which resulted in Thayer resigning to avoid prosecution.

On April 9, 2000, the House voted 343 to 7 to approve HR 50 authorizing and directing the House Judiciary Committee &quot;to investigate whether cause exists for the impeachment of David A. Brock, chief justice, and/or any other justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court&quot; and to report to the House &quot;such resolutions, articles of impeachment, or other recommendations that it deems proper.&quot;

The committee conducted its investigation and it proposed the House adopt HR 51, &quot;A RESOLUTION recommending impeachment of supreme court chief justice David A. Brock,&quot; which is authored. The committee found by clear and convincing evidence that there were constitutional grounds for impeachment and subsequent removal if Brock was found to have committed all or any of the four articles of impeachment. The four articles charged Brock with:

# Maladministration or malpractice in connection with the case of &quot;Home Gas Corp. v. Strafford Fuels, Inc. and Edward C. Dupont&quot;;
# Maladministration or malpractice in connection with the case of &quot;Thayer v. Thayer&quot; by engaging in ex-parte communications;
# Knowingly testifying falsely under oath to the house judiciary committee with the intention of hindering the HR 50 investigation;
# Maladministration by permitting and overseeing a practice whereby recused and disqualified justices were enabled to comment on and influence opinions in the cases from which they were recused and disqualified.

The committee sent two resolutions to the House, HR 52 and HR 53 respectively, recommending that no article of impeachment be brought against Supreme Court justice Sherman D. Horton, Jr. or justice John T. Broderick, Jr. On July 12, 2000, the House debated the articles of impeachment against Brock. Representatives voted by simple majority, 253 to 95, to impeach Brock on all four charges and sent the case to the Senate for trial. The House voted to accept the committee&#x27;s recommendation that Horton (187 to 134) and Broderick (176 to 144) not face impeachment.

The state constitution does not provide for the level of evidence required to determine whether such conduct is impeachable, or the number of votes required to convict, unlike the U.S. Constitution. The Senate conducted a three-week trial and ultimately acquitted Brock of all charges, finding the charges were not serious enough to warrant impeachment or that the evidence presented at trial was not persuasive. The Senate chose to require a two-thirds vote to convict, but let each senator to decide for themselves if the evidence rose to the level of finding Brock was &quot;guilty&quot; of the articles of impeachment. Fifteen senators were needed for a conviction, only seven voted to convict and fifteen voted to acquit.

==Committees of the court==
The court has four committees that advise it on the administration of the judicial branch: The Advisory Committee on Rules, the Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics, the Judicial Conduct Committee and Attorney Discipline System. 
*The Advisory Committee on Rules, made up of 14 members from the court system and public, receives and considers suggestions for changes to the rules governing the court&#x27;s system.
*The Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics provides advisory opinions on appropriate rules of court and statutes relating to the ethical and professional conduct of judges, and such advice would be evidence of good faith if they were to be disciplined.
*The Committee on Judicial Conduct was created by the court to inquire into and investigate alleged misconduct on the part of any judge, master, referee, court stenographer or reporter, or court clerk or deputy clerk, including registers of probate and any persons performing the duties of a clerk or register. The committee consists of three judges, a clerk of court, two lawyers, and five lay persons. The committee may issue a warning, dispose of a grievance against a judge by informal agreement or adjustment, or recommend that the court impose formal discipline.
*A new Attorney Discipline System went into effect on January 1, 2004, and was designed to improve the effort to protect client rights and guarantee lawyers a full and fair evaluation of complaints against them. The system is composed of the Attorney Discipline Office, a Complaint Screening Committee, Hearings Committee and Professional Conduct Committee.

<text>An imprint of a publisher is a trade name under which it publishes a work. A single publishing company may have multiple imprints, often using the different names as brands to market works to various demographic consumer segments.

== Description ==
An imprint of a publisher is a trade name—a name that a business uses for trading commercial products or services—under which a work is published. Imprints typically have a defining character or mission. In some cases, the diversity results from the takeover of smaller publishers (or parts of their business) by a larger company. In the case of Barnes &amp; Noble, imprints have been used to facilitate the venture of a bookseller into publishing.

In the video game industry, some game companies operate various publishing labels. Electronic Arts&#x27; (EA) 2008 CEO, John Riccitiello, stated that, with the establishing of Rockstar, Take-Two Interactive effectively invented the &quot;label&quot; corporate structure, which EA followed into in 2008. This model has influenced rivals including Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, Electronic Arts from 2008 to 2018, Warner Bros. Interactive, Embracer Group, and Koei Tecmo. Take-Two have had such models in place since 1997–1998, and is seen as &quot;a game holding company with autonomous game publishing and development subsidiaries&quot;. Independently-owned game publishers like Devolver Digital also use the word &quot;label&quot; to describe itself.

== Use ==
A single publishing company may have multiple imprints, with the different imprints often used by the publisher to market works to different demographic consumer segments. For example, the objective of Viking—an imprint of the Penguin Group—is &quot;[t]o publish a strictly limited list of good nonfiction, such as biography, history and works on contemporary affairs, and distinguished fiction with some claim to permanent importance rather than ephemeral popular interest&quot;.

<text>Alfred Abraham Knopf Sr. (September 12, 1892August 11, 1984) was an American publisher of the 20th century, and co-founder of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. His contemporaries included the likes of Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer, and (of the previous generation) Frank Nelson Doubleday, J. Henry Harper and Henry Holt. Knopf paid special attention to the quality of printing, binding, and design in his books, and earned a reputation as a purist in both content and presentation.

==Biography==
Knopf was born into a Jewish family in New York City. His father, Samuel Knopf, was an advertising executive and financial consultant, and his mother was Ida Japhe, a school teacher. Samuel Knopf was originally from Warsaw, Poland, but came to New York with his parents, where he worked his way up the directorship at a small mercantile bank. Alfred&#x27;s mother, Ida, was from a Latvian Jewish family who settled in New York. For a time Knopf&#x27;s parents lived in the Midwest and in Virginia. Ida committed suicide when Alfred was five years old and his sister Sophia was almost two. That same day, Alfred&#x27;s father had filed for divorce in which he named Ida as an adulteress. His father later married Lillian Harris, who had a daughter, Bertha, from a previous marriage. With Lillian, Samuel had another son, Edwin H. Knopf, who worked for Alfred briefly, then became a film director and producer.

Alfred attended Columbia University, where he was a pre-law student and a member of the Peithologian Society (a debating and literary club) and the Boar&#x27;s Head Society. He began to show an interest in publishing during his senior year, becoming advertising manager of an undergraduate magazine. His interest in publishing was allegedly fostered by a correspondence with British author John Galsworthy. Galsworthy was the subject of Knopf&#x27;s senior thesis and after visiting Galsworthy in England, Knopf gave up his plans for a law career, and upon his return went into publishing.

Knopf was introduced to his future wife and business partner, Blanche Knopf, at a party at the Lawrence Athletic Club in 1911. Their relationship was built on their mutual interest in books. Blanche said of their relationship: &quot;Alfred had realized I read books constantly and he had never met a girl who did ... I saw him and [all we did was] talk books, and nobody liked him--my family least of all. But I did, because I had someone to talk books to and we talked of making books...We decided we would get married and make books and publish them.&quot; Alfred and Blanche were married on April 4, 1916.

Knopf worked as a clerk at Doubleday (1912–1913), then as an editorial assistant to Mitchell Kennerley (1914).

Knopf, along with Blanche Knopf, founded the publishing house Alfred A. Knopf in 1915. The company initially emphasized European, especially Russian, literature, hence the choice of the borzoi as a colophon. At that time European literature was largely neglected by American publishers; Knopf published authors such as Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus, Joseph Conrad, E. M. Forster, Sigmund Freud, André Gide, Franz Kafka, D. H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann, W. Somerset Maugham, T. F. Powys, Wyndham Lewis and Jean-Paul Sartre. While Blanche was known as a superb editor, Alfred was always interested in more of the sales side than in editing.

Knopf also published many American authors, including Conrad Aiken, James Baldwin, James M. Cain, Theodore Dreiser, Shirley Ann Grau, Dashiell Hammett, Langston Hughes, Vachel Lindsay, H.L. Mencken, George Jean Nathan, John Updike, and Knopf&#x27;s own favorite, Willa Cather. From 1924 to 1934, he published the famous literary magazine founded by Mencken and Nathan, &quot;The American Mercury&quot;. He often developed a personal friendship with his authors. Knopf&#x27;s personal interest in the fields of history, sociology, and science led to close friendships in the academic community with such noted historians as Richard Hofstadter, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and Samuel Eliot Morison. A prominent Republican until Watergate, Knopf often drew legislators into lengthy correspondence by mail. He was also a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1940 to 1946.

Knopf himself was also an author. His writings include &quot;Some Random Recollections&quot;, &quot;Publishing Then and Now&quot;, &quot;Portrait of a Publisher&quot;, &quot;Blanche W. Knopf: July 30, 1894–June 4, 1966&quot;, and &quot;Sixty Photographs&quot;.

When the Knopfs&#x27; son Alfred A. Knopf Jr. left the company in 1959 to found Atheneum Publishers, Alfred and Blanche became concerned about the eventual fate of their publishing house, which had always been a family business. The problem was solved in 1960, when Knopf merged with Random House, which was owned by the Knopfs&#x27; close friends Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. Knopf retained complete editorial control for five years, and then gave up only his right to veto other editors&#x27; manuscript selections. The editorial departments of the two companies remain separate, and Knopf, Inc., retains its distinctive character. Knopf called the merger &quot;a perfect marriage.&quot;

Random House itself eventually became a division of Bertelsmann AG, a large multinational media company. The Knopf imprint remains in existence.

Blanche Knopf died in June 1966. Alfred remarried in April of the following year, to Helen Norcross Hedrick. He died of congestive heart failure on August 11, 1984, at his estate in Purchase, New York.

==Personality==
Knopf had little enthusiasm for most of the changes that took place in the publishing industry during his lifetime. &quot;Too many books are published, and they are overpriced&quot;, he told &quot;The Saturday Review&quot;. These are things &quot;about which all publishers agree, and about which no publisher does anything.&quot; The most fundamental change he noted was the increased importance of the editor. &quot;In the early days, things were quite simple. The books came in; we published them as written... A publisher was regarded and so, in turn, was the writer as a pro. A writer&#x27;s job was to write a book and give it to you.&quot; And he remarked to Shenker: &quot;I guess business became more complicated and publishers less literate. It ceased to be the fact that publishers publish and authors write. Today authors submit manuscripts and editors write books.&quot; The editor is now hired largely to acquire books, &quot;and if he can&#x27;t get good books, he usually takes what he &quot;can&quot; get books that are not so good. And then he sometimes wrecks himself trying to make a silk purse out of what can never become anything but a sow&#x27;s ear.&quot;

Knopf was generally unimpressed with current literature, though he admired John Hersey, John Updike, Jorge Amado, and a few other contemporary authors. In &quot;Publishing Then and Now&quot; he wrote: &quot;Frequently... our American author, whatever his age, experience in life, and technical knowledge, simply can&#x27;t write. I don&#x27;t mean that he is not the master of a prose style of elegance and distinction; I mean that he can&#x27;t write simple straightforward and correct English. And here, only an exceptional editor will really help him.&quot; American authors are not very durable, he said in 1964, and &quot;there are no giants in Europe now.&quot; Though twelve Knopf authors had won Nobel Prizes, Knopf acknowledged that &quot;some Nobel Prize books aren&#x27;t very good,&quot; calling &quot;Doctor Zhivago,&quot; for example, &quot;incredibly tedious ... If Krushchev had banned it for dullness instead of its political implications, he might have been in the clear.&quot;

Among other authors he rejected were Sylvia Plath, Jack Kerouac, Anne Frank, George Orwell, Jorge Luis Borges, Vladimir Nabokov, Isaac Bashevis Singer and Anaïs Nin. He turned down an early novel by Ursula K. Le Guin but encouraged her to keep writing.

Knopf also lamented the &quot;shockingly bad taste&quot; that he felt characterizes much modern fiction, and warned of the danger of a &quot;legal backlash&quot; against pornography, and a possible revival of censorship.

This outspoken aspect of his character sometimes found voice in letters of complaint to hotels, restaurants, and stores that failed to meet his high standards. These letters grew increasingly frequent and more severe as he aged. One striking example is the six-year-long war of words he waged against the Eastman Kodak Company over a roll of lost film.

Knopf did not support the creation of a Jewish commonwealth in Palestine. In response to Senator Robert Wagner&#x27;s November 5, 1945 letter to Knopf&#x27;s employees in support of the Jewish colonization of Palestine, Knopf replied to the senator&#x27;s unexpected letter that he did not share his employees&#x27; views. Furthermore, he wrote that nothing was &quot;more likely to destroy the possibility of peace than resurgent nationalism.&quot; And as a Jew, he thought it was &quot;a great pity that Jews, above all people, should be advocates of still another national state.&quot;

<text>The Schuylkill River ( , ) is a river in eastern Pennsylvania. It flows for from Pottsville southeast to Philadelphia, the nation&#x27;s sixth-largest city, where it joins the Delaware River as one of its largest tributaries.

The river&#x27;s watershed of about lies entirely within the state of Pennsylvania, stretching from the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians through the Piedmont to the Atlantic Plain.

Historically the Schuylkill lay within the territory of the Susquehannock and Lenape peoples. In 1682, William Penn founded the city of Philadelphia between the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers on lands purchased from the Lenape Indian tribe. The Schuylkill River became key in the development of the city and the surrounding region.

While long used for transport, the river was made fully navigable via the Schuylkill Canal in 1825, followed by the construction of the Reading Railroad Main Line in 1838 and the Schuylkill Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1884. Through these corridors, millions of tons of anthracite coal flowed down the Schuylkill from the Coal Region to its north in Northeast Pennsylvania. The canal was abandoned in 1931, while the Schuylkill Expressway was completed in 1959.

Industrial pollution and mining silt plagued the river in the 19th and 20th centuries. Early concerns over water quality led to the creation of Fairmount Park in 1812. Protections came with the 1972 passing of the Clean Water Act, and the Schuylkill was designated as the first Pennsylvania Scenic River in 1978. Water quality has largely recovered in the years since.

The Schuylkill River above Fairmount Dam has been a major rowing venue since the founding of the Schuylkill Navy in 1858. In recent decades the Schuylkill River Trail cycle and foot path has been constructed along the river. The Schuylkill Heritage Corridor was designated a Pennsylvania Heritage Park in 1995 and a National Heritage Area in 2000 to promote the river&#x27;s historic, environmental, and recreational significance.

==Course==

The source of the Schuylkill&#x27;s eastern branch is in heavily mined land, one ridgeline south of Tuscarora Lake along a drainage divide with the Little Schuylkill River, about a mile east of the village of Tuscarora and about a mile west of Tamaqua, at Tuscarora Springs in Schuylkill County. Tuscarora Lake is one source of the Little Schuylkill.

The West Branch starts near Minersville and joins the eastern branch at the town of Schuylkill Haven. It then combines with the Little Schuylkill River downstream in the town of Port Clinton. The Tulpehocken Creek joins it at the western edge of Reading. Wissahickon Creek joins it in northwest Philadelphia. Other major tributaries include: Maiden Creek, Manatawny Creek, French Creek, and Perkiomen Creek.

The Schuylkill joins the Delaware River at the site of the former Philadelphia Navy Yard, now the Philadelphia Naval Business Center, just northeast of Philadelphia International Airport.

==Name==
The Schuylkill&#x27;s name derives from the Dutch words &quot;schuilen&quot;, meaning to hide, and &quot;kil&quot;, meaning stream, apparently because of the &quot;retired and hidden situation of its mouth&quot;. According to John Heckewelder, a missionary who worked among the local Lenape Indians, the native name for the river was &quot;Ganshowe-hánne&quot;, meaning &quot;roaring stream&quot;. The river was also sometimes called the &quot;Manaiunk&quot; in European sources, which derives from a Lenape place-name meaning &quot;place to drink&quot;. This name appears on a Swedish map of 1655 in the form &quot;Menejackse Kÿl&quot;.


==History==
===Pre-settlement===

The mighty Susquehannock confederation claimed the area along the Schuylkill as a hunting ground, as they did to the lands down along the Chesapeake Bay to the left bank Potomac River across from the Powhatan Confederacy when traders first stopped in the Delaware River and settlers arrived in the first decade of the 1600s. With ample tributary streams, the Schuylkill was ground zero during the early years of the Beaver Wars, during which the Lenape tribe became tributary to the victorious Susquehannocks. The Susquehannocks were an Iroquoian people also often in contention with their relatives: the Erie people west and northwest through the gaps of the Allegheny in eastern Ohio and northwestern Pennsylvania (between the upper Allegheny River and Lake Erie), as well as the Five Nations of the Iroquois, another Amerindian confederation eastwards from the right bank of the Genesee River through the Finger Lakes region of upper New York down the St. Lawrence.

The Lenape had settlements on the river, including Nittabakonck (&quot;place where heroes reside&quot;), a village on the east bank just south of the confluence of Wissahickon Creek, and the Passyunk site, on the west bank where the Schuylkill meets the Delaware River.&gt;

===18th century===
American patriot paper maker Frederick Bicking owned a fishery on the river prior to the American Revolution, and Thomas Paine tried in vain to interest the citizens in funding an iron bridge over this river, before abandoning &quot; works&quot; on account of the French Revolution.

===19th century===
Over the next few decades, industrialists Josiah White and protege and partner Erskine Hazard built iron industries at the Falls of the Schuylkill during the Jefferson&#x27;s administration, where White built a suspension bridge with cables made from their wire mill. During the War of 1812, the two took delivery of an ark of anthracite coal which was notoriously difficult to combust reliably and experimented with ways to use it industrially, providing the knowledge to successfully begin resolving the ongoing decades long energy crises around eastern cities. The two then heavily backed the flagging effort to improve navigation on the Schuylkill, which efforts date back to legislation measures as early as 1762.

By 1816, needing energy resources and disenchanted with the lack of urgency found in other investors to accelerate the anemic and underfunded construction rate of the Schuylkill Canal, the two jumped to option the mining rights of the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company, which disenchanted stockholders were giving up on. They then waited until a charter to improve the Lehigh went delinquent, resulting in two groups of investors forming two complementary companies in 1818 that jump-started the Industrial Revolution: the Lehigh Coal Company and the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company. Following White&#x27;s plan, the latter company improved down river navigation on the Lehigh River, using his Bear Trap Locks design to deliver over 365 tons of anthracite to Philadelphia docks by December 1820, four years ahead of promises to Stockholders. The success, along with the pending opening of the first operable sections of New York&#x27;s Erie Canal spurred stockholders of the Schuylkill Canal to finally fund the works. A project which had languished for over a decade got capitalized and began operations in 1822—the same year the Lehigh companies combined into the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company, having had to raise additional funds for repairs due to badly ice-damaged improvements, a common problem with northern canals.

The success of these projects and the rosy promise of anthracite (a new wonder fuel in the day) to alleviate energy problems spurred canal construction for the next decade in the east, and commercial opportunities funded three decades of investment from Illinois to the Atlantic Ocean, including the ambitious 1824 Main Line of Public Works bill to connect Philadelphia with the newly emerging states of the Northwest Territory via the Allegheny &amp; Ohio valleys at Pittsburgh and to Lake Erie— leveraging the wide-ranging branches of the Susquehanna River in the state&#x27;s center. In the 1830s railway technology and new railroads grew in leaps and bounds, and the Schuylkill Valley was at the heart of these developments, as well as the new Anthracite iron and mining industries. From 1820 to the 1860s Iron works, foundries, manufacturing mills, blast furnaces, rolling mills, rail yards, rail roads, warehouses and train stations sprang up throughout the valley. Tiny farm villages grew into vibrant company towns then transitioned into small cities as a major industry and supporting businesses transformed local economics and populations swelled.

Restoration of the river has been funded by money left for that purpose in Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s will.

The river is known to have been on fire more than once throughout history, for example in November 1892 when the surface film of oil that had leaked from nearby oil works at Point Breeze, Philadelphia, was ignited by a match tossed carelessly from a boat, with fatal results.

===20th century===
Silt and coal dust from upstream industries, particularly coal mining and washing operations in the headwaters, led to extensive silting of the river through the early 20th century. The river was shallow and filled with extensive black silt bars. By the early 20th century, upstream coal operations contributed over 3 million tons of silt annually to the river.
In 1948, led by then governor James H. Duff, a massive cleanup effort began. Twenty three impounding basins were excavated along the river, to receive dredged silt. The 1945 Desilting Act helped begin this cleanup task.

===21st century===
The quality of the river has improved much over the past decades. A fish ladder to support shad migration has been constructed at the Manayunk dam. Mayfly hatches (signifying good water quality) now occur yearly along the Montgomery sections of the river.

==Transportation==
The Schuylkill River valley was an important thoroughfare in the eras of canals and railroads. The river itself, the Schuylkill Canal, the Reading Railroad, and the Pennsylvania Railroad were vital shipping conduits from the second decade of the 19th century through the mid-20th century. The rise of trucking capabilities and state &amp; county development of road and highway networks progressively took increasing amounts of business away from both competing transport industries. By the mid-1930s the canals inflexibility and a geographically limited pool of customers steadily shifting energy usage away from anthracite doomed most eastern canals, so the Lehigh, Delaware and Schuylkill Canals all ceased operations during the Great Depression years. The zooming rise of automobile ownership post-World War II, the development of suburbs, and dispersal of industrial buildings into far flung parks serviced by the government supported highways and new Interstate Highways doomed intercity rail transport; even as Interstate Commerce Committee regulations required railway operating companies to maintain passenger rail services past its economic viability—which costs further imperiled the railroad&#x27;s profits leading to a widespread collapse of the industry in the 1960s and 1970s.

Rail freight still uses many of the same valley rights-of-way that the 19th-century railroads used. Passenger and commuter rail service is more limited. Today, the old rail bed rights-of-way along the river between Philadelphia and Norristown contain SEPTA&#x27;s Manayunk/Norristown Line, formerly Reading Railroad and the Schuylkill River Trail.

There are efforts to extend both rail and trail farther upriver than they currently reach. The Schuylkill River Trail continues upriver from Norristown to Mont Clare, and designers plan to connect it to sections above Pottstown. SEPTA Regional Rail service currently does not go farther upriver than Norristown. Visions of resuming commuter rail service farther up the Schuylkill valley (&quot;Schuylkill Valley Metro&quot;) have yet to become reality.

The Schuylkill Expressway (Interstate 76) and the U.S. Route 422 follow the course of the river from Philadelphia to Valley Forge to Reading. Above Reading, Pennsylvania Route 61 continues along the main river valley to Schuylkill Haven, then follows the east branch to Pottsville. U.S. Route 209 continues along the east branch of the river to its head in Tuscarora. In Philadelphia, Kelly Drive (formerly East River Drive), and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive (formerly West River Drive) flank the river.

==Recreation==
The Schuylkill River is popular with rowing, dragon boat, and outrigger paddling enthusiasts. The Schuylkill Navy was established on the riverside adjacent to the city of Philadelphia to promote amateur rowing in 1858. The Dad Vail Regatta, an annual rowing competition, is held on the river near Boathouse Row, as is the annual BAYADA Home Health Care Regatta, featuring disabled rowers from all over the continent, and in autumn the annual Head of the Schuylkill Regatta takes place in Philadelphia. Also, the Stotesbury Cup Regatta, the biggest high school regatta in the world, takes place there. The Chinese sport of dragon boat racing was introduced to the United States on the Schuylkill in 1983, and two major dragon boat regattas are held there in June and October of each year.

Water skiing, swimming and other aquatic sports are also common outside of Philadelphia city limits.

The Schuylkill River Trail, which generally follows the river bank, is a multi-use trail for walking, running, bicycling, rollerblading, and other outdoor activities. The trail presently runs from Philadelphia, through Manayunk to the village of Mont Clare, the latter of which are the locations of the last two remaining watered stretches of the Schuylkill Canal. There is also a section of trail starting at Pottstown and running upriver toward Reading. Plans are under way to complete the trail from the Delaware River to Reading.

==In popular culture==
===Literature===

The Schuylkill River is the setting of the fictional estate White Acre in Elizabeth Gilbert&#x27;s 2013 novel &quot;The Signature of All Things&quot;, based on The Woodlands.

<doc id="462688" wikidata="Q3476898" url="?curid=462688" title="Dexter, Maine">
<text>Dexter is a town in Penobscot County, Maine, United States. The population was 3,803 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bangor metropolitan statistical area. Dexter Regional High School, which serves Dexter as well as other nearby small towns, is located in the town.

==History==

Dexter was settled beginning in 1801 by Ebenezer Small, David Smith, and others from New Hampshire, and was originally called Elkinstown. When incorporated as a town in 1816, it named itself after Judge Samuel Dexter, who was then running for governor of Massachusetts (of which Maine was still a part). The town of Brooks in nearby Waldo County was incorporated the same year and named for the opposing candidate, John Brooks. Brooks won the election. The town of Dexter, however, achieved the greater prosperity.

The town grew because of its location on the East Branch of the Sebasticook River, which provided excellent water power for mills. In 1818, Jonathan Farrar constructed a grist mill at the falls. The Dexter Historical Society today uses the building which replaced it in 1854 as part of its museum complex. The stream would also power five woolen mills, the oldest and largest of which was established by Amos and Jeremiah Abbott in 1836. Amos Abbott &amp; Company, which closed in 1975, was the only textile mill in the United States owned by one family for such a long period. In the 1960s, the town&#x27;s name became familiar throughout New England because of the pervasive log cabin style factory outlets of the Dexter Shoe Company, founded in a vacant Dexter woolen mill in 1958 by Harold Alfond.

Dexter&#x27;s downtown is dominated by the Memorial Building, designed by John Morrison. At its top is the community&#x27;s largest clock, named Nancy after the architect&#x27;s wife. The tallest building in town is the Unitarian Universalist Church. It is also Dexter&#x27;s oldest house of worship, built in 1829, but given a new steeple and vestibule by Boston architect Thomas W. Silloway in 1869. Five buildings in Dexter are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Dexter Grist Mill; Universalist Church; Abbott Memorial Library by Boston architect J. Williams Beal; the Bank Block by Bangor architect George W. Orff; and &quot;Zion&#x27;s Hill&quot;, the Ralph Owen Brewster house by Portland architectural firm J. C. &amp; J. H. Stevens.

In 1848, the town was struck by a tornado which tore large trees out by their roots and destroyed even the strongest buildings.

In 1987, parts of Dexter&#x27;s downtown area were used as backdrops for the film Creepshow 2, a horror anthology film based on stories written by Maine native Stephen King.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Dexter is drained by the East Branch of the Sebasticook River, which flows from Lake Wassookeag and is part of the Kennebec River watershed.

Dexter is almost exactly half-way between Bangor and Waterville. It is also almost exactly half-way between the geographic North Pole and the Equator.

<doc id="462691" wikidata="Q1950206" url="?curid=462691" title="Moulage">
<text>is the art of applying mock injuries for the purpose of training emergency response teams and other medical and military personnel. Moulage may be as simple as applying pre-made rubber or latex &quot;wounds&quot; to a healthy &quot;patient&#x27;s&quot; limbs, chest, head, etc., or as complex as using makeup and theatre techniques to provide elements of realism (such as blood, vomitus, open fractures, etc.) to the training simulation. The practice dates to at least the Renaissance, when wax figures were used for this purpose.

In Germany some universities and hospitals use their historical moulage collections for the training of students. The often very lifelike models are especially useful to show the students today the characteristics of rare diseases, such as skin tuberculosis or leprosy.

==History==
Up until the 16th century, European scientists had little knowledge about human anatomy and anatomy of animals. Medical students of Bologna and Paris studied the books of Aristotle, Galen, and other Greek scholars. Four centuries after the invasion by the Arabs and the fall of Rome and Persia, many Greek books were translated into the Arabic language. European scientists then translated these Arabic books into the Latin and Greek languages. In the medical field, this led to a reliance on Galen as a medical authority in European countries. In European medical schools the professors of anatomy merely lectured from Galen, without any dissection of the human body, and Galen’s books were the only way to learn anatomy.

Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564), a Flemish anatomist, was at first a &quot;Galenist&quot; at the University of Paris. When he moved to Italy and entered the University of Padua, he began dissecting human bodies. He studied many details of human anatomy and found that Galen made some anatomical mistakes. For example, Galen wrote that the sternum has seven segments, but Vesalius found it has three segments. Galen wrote that the bone of the arm is the longest bone in the human body, but Vesalius found that the bone of the thigh is actually the longest bone in human body. At age 25 Vesalius realized that the anatomical knowledge of Galen was derived from animal anatomy and therefore Galen had never dissected a human body.

In 1543 Vesalius wrote an anatomical masterwork named in Latin &quot;De humani corporis fabrica libri septem&quot; (&quot;On the fabric of the human body in seven books&quot;), or in short &quot;De Fabrica&quot;. The book included drawings of human females and males with their skins dissected. These pictures greatly influenced the creation of future anatomical wax models. The anatomical pictures of Vesalius were followed by those of Johann Vesling (&quot;Veslingius&quot;) and Hieronymus Fabricius. By 1600 Fabricius had gathered 300 anatomical paintings and made an anatomical atlas named the &quot;Tabulae Pictae&quot;. Giulio Cesare Casseri (&quot;Casserius&quot;), Spighelius, and William Harvey are other followers of the pictures of Andreas Vesalius.

The &quot;Tabulae anatomicae&quot; of Bartolomeo Eustachi (&quot;Eustachius&quot;) (1552), printed in 1714, had a major effect on the history of anatomical wax models. This work so affected Pope Benedict XIV that he ordered construction of a museum of anatomy in Bologna In 1742, named Ercole Lelli and featuring anatomical wax models. Felice Fontana made cadaveric specimens into wax models by the casting method for anatomical teaching.

The history of wax models is ancient. Wax anatomical models were first made by Gaetano Giulio Zummo (1656–1701) who first worked in Naples, then Florence, and finally Paris, where he was granted monopoly right by Louis XIV. Later, Jules Baretta (1834–1923) made more than 2000 wax models in Hospital Saint-Louis, Paris, where more than 4000 wax models were collected. While wax models were being made, he made pleasant conversations with the patients, sang songs or at times played the piano. Moulages were made for the education of dermatologists around the world, but were eventually replaced by color slides.

===Wax sculpture, use in moulage===
The modeling of the soft parts of dissections, teaching illustrations of anatomy, was first practiced at Florence during the Renaissance. The practice of moulage, or the depiction of human anatomy and different diseases taken from directly casting from the body using (in the early period) gelatine moulds, later alginate or silicone moulds, used wax as its primary material (later to be replaced by latex and rubber). Some moulages were directly cast from the bodies of diseased subjects, others from healthy subjects to which disease features (blisters, sores, growths, rashes) were skilfully applied with wax and pigments. During the 19th century, moulage evolved into three-dimensional, realistic representations of diseased parts of the human body. These can be seen in many European medical museums, notably the Spitzner collection currently in Brussels, the Charite Hospital museum in Berlin and the Gordon Museum of Pathology at Guy&#x27;s Hospital in London UK.

A comprehensive book monograph on moulages is &quot;Diseases in Wax: the History of Medical Moulage&quot; by Thomas Schnalke (Author) the director of the Charite Museum and Kathy Spatschek (Translator). In the 19th century moulage was taken of medical patients for educational purposes. The prepared model was painted to mimic the original disease. Nowadays anatomicals model are an important instrument of education of human anatomy in department of anatomy and biological sciences in medical schools.

=== Modern moulage ===
Moulage has evolved dramatically since its original intent. In modern terms, the word moulage refers to the use of &quot;special effects makeup (SPFX) and casting or moulding techniques that replicate illnesses or wounds&quot; in simulation based techniques. Common examples include designing diabetic wounds, creating burns or other illness effects, like dermatological rashes and gunshot wounds.
These illness and injury effects are applied to training manikins or simulated or standardized patients for training or other purposes. Simulation staff attend training to learn these techniques. It is argued that the use of moulage in simulation improves realism or participant buy-in. Moulage is an emerging field of research for paramedicine, radiography and medical education, with researchers exploring how moulage contributes to learning in training. Military training utilises highly-authentic moulage techniques to desensitise to graphic wounds, prepare for battle, and treat injuries. New advancements in the field include using tattooed injuries and moulage through augmented reality. The level of authenticity required for moulage remains unclear.

<text>Lord Elphinstone is a title in the Peerage of Scotland created by King James IV in 1510.

==History==
The title of Lord Elphinstone was granted by King James IV in 1510 to Sir Alexander Elphinstone of Elphinstone, who was killed at the Battle of Flodden three years later. He was succeeded by his son, the second Lord, killed at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. His grandson, the fourth Lord, served as Lord High Treasurer of Scotland. His great-great-great-great-grandson, the eleventh Lord, sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1778 to 1794. He was succeeded by his son, the twelfth Lord, who was a Lieutenant-General in the Army, a Scottish Representative Peer from 1803 to 1807 and Lord Lieutenant of Dunbartonshire.

His son, the thirteenth Lord, served as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1833 to 1834 and from 1847 to 1849, and he was also Governor of Bombay and of Madras. In 1859, he was created Baron Elphinstone, of Elphinstone in the County of Stirling, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. However, this title became extinct on his death in 1860 while he was succeeded in the lordship by his first cousin, the fourteenth Lord. He was the son of Admiral the Hon. Charles Elphinstone Fleeming, second son of the eleventh Lord.

When he died the following year, this line of the family also failed and he was succeeded by his second cousin, the fifteenth Lord. He was the grandson of the Hon. William Elphinstone, third son of the tenth Lord. Lord Elphinstone sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1867 to 1885 and served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) in the Conservative administrations of Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Salisbury. In 1885, he was created Baron Elphinstone, of Elphinstone in the County of Haddington, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The Lords Elphinstone sat in the House of Lords in right of this title until the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the upper chamber of Parliament.

He was succeeded by his son, the sixteenth Lord, who in 1910 married Lady Mary Bowes-Lyon, second daughter of Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, and elder sister of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, wife of King George VI and mother of Queen Elizabeth II. He was succeeded by his son, the seventeenth Lord, who was taken Prisoner of War on 12 June 1940. Between 1944 and 1945, he was one of the &#x27;Prominente&#x27; prisoners at Colditz Castle (Oflag IV-C). On his death in 1975, the titles passed to his nephew, the eighteenth Lord.

, the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s son, the nineteenth Lord, who succeeded in 1994 at the age of fourteen. He is Chief of Clan Elphinstone. Lord Elphinstone is a third cousin of the Prince of Wales.

Other members of the Elphinstone family include James Elphinstone, 1st Lord Balmerino, younger son of the third Lord Elphinstone. Lord Balmerino&#x27;s younger son was James Elphinstone, 1st Lord Coupar. Another member was George Keith Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith, who was the fifth son of the tenth Lord Elphinstone. Lord Keith&#x27;s daughter Margaret Keith, 2nd Baroness Keith (who had succeeded to the two baronies of Keith held by her father according to special remainders in the letters patent), inherited the Lordship of Nairne in 1837, a title which is now held by the Viscount Mersey.

The family seat is Whitberry House near Tyninghame, East Lothian.

<text>Ballantine Books is a major American book publisher that is a subsidiary of German media conglomerate Bertelsmann. Ballantine was founded in 1952 by Ian Ballantine with his wife, Betty Ballantine. Ballantine was acquired by Random House in 1973, which in turn was acquired by Bertelsmann in 1998 and remains part of that company. 

Ballantine&#x27;s original logo was a pair of mirrored letter Bs back to back, later changing to two Bs stacked to form an elaborate gate. The firm&#x27;s early editors were Stanley Kauffmann and Bernard Shir-Cliff.

== History ==
Following Fawcett Publications&#x27; controversial 1950 introduction of Gold Medal paperback originals rather than reprints, Lion Books, Avon and Ace also decided to publish originals. In 1952, Ian Ballantine, a founder of Bantam Books, announced that he would &quot;offer trade publishers a plan for simultaneous publishing of original titles in two editions, a hardcover &#x27;regular&#x27; edition for bookstore sale, and a paper-cover, &#x27;newsstand&#x27; size, low-priced edition for mass market sale.&quot;

When the first Ballantine Book, Cameron Hawley&#x27;s &quot;Executive Suite&quot;, was published in 1952, the publishing industry saw that the simultaneous hardcover and paperback editions were obvious successes. Houghton Mifflin published the $3.00 hardcover at the same time Ballantine distributed its 35¢ paperback. By February 1953, Ballantine had sold 375,000 copies and was preparing to print 100,000 more. Houghton Mifflin sold 22,000 hardback copies in its first printing. Ballantine&#x27;s sales soon totaled 470,000 copies. Instead of hurting hardback sales as some predicted, the paperback edition instead gave the book more publicity. After the film rights were sold to MGM, Robert Wise directed the 1954 film, nominated for four Academy Awards.

On the heels of that kind of sales and publicity, other Ballantine titles were seen in spinner racks across the country. &quot;Executive Suite&quot; was followed by Hal Ellson&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Spike&quot; (#2), Stanley Baron&#x27;s &quot;All My Enemies&quot; (#3), Luke Short&#x27;s &quot;Saddle by Starlight&quot; (#4, also with Houghton Mifflin), Ruth Park&#x27;s &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Thorn&quot; (#5, also with Houghton Mifflin), Emile Danoen&#x27;s &quot;Tides of Tide&quot; (#6), Frank Bonham&#x27;s &quot;Blood on the Land&quot; (#7), Al Capp&#x27;s &quot;The World of Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (#8, with Farrar, Straus &amp; Young) and LaSelle Gilman&#x27;s &quot;The Red Gate&quot; (#9).

==Science fiction and fantasy books==
During the early 1950s, Ballantine attracted attention as one of the leading publishers of paperback science fiction and fantasy, beginning with &quot;The Space Merchants&quot; (#21). The Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth novel had first appeared in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; under the title &quot;Gravy Planet&quot;. Kauffman scored when he acquired and edited Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (originally in &quot;Galaxy&quot; as a shorter version, &quot;The Firemen&quot;).

Ballantine&#x27;s science fiction line also included the unusual &quot;Star Science Fiction Stories&quot;. With cover paintings by Richard Powers, this innovative anthology series offered new fiction rather than reprints. Edited by Frederik Pohl, it attracted readers by successfully combining the formats of both magazines and paperbacks.

In the early 1960s, the company engaged in a well-known rivalry with Ace Books for the rights to reprint the works of J. R. R. Tolkien and Edgar Rice Burroughs in paperback form. Ballantine prevailed in the struggle for the Tolkien work, with their editions of Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; including a message on the back cover from Tolkien himself urging consumers to buy Ballantine&#x27;s version and boycott &quot;unauthorized editions&quot; (i.e. the version from Ace Books). A separate Canadian edition of the books was published with different front cover art work. Tolkien asked for (and received) permission to add the back cover message. Betty Ballantine recalled: &quot;And we did put a little statement on the back covers saying that Ace was not paying royalties to Professor Tolkien, and everybody who admired &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; should only buy our paperback edition. Well, everybody got behind us. There was literally no publication that did not carry some kind of outraged article. And of course, the whole science fiction fraternity got behind the book; this was their meat and drink.&quot;

In 1969, Lin Carter edited the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, which brought a number of rare titles back into print, as well as launching Katherine Kurtz&#x27;s &quot;Deryni&quot; series. During the mid-1970s, Ballantine published the &quot;Star Trek Logs&quot;, a ten-volume series of Alan Dean Foster adaptations of the animated &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In 1968, Ballantine published a non-fiction book related to &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;The Making of Star Trek&quot; by Stephen E. Whitfield and Gene Roddenberry.

In 1976, Ballantine published the novelization of a forthcoming science fiction film, &quot;Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker&quot; by George Lucas (ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster). The book, like the film &quot;Star Wars&quot; released the following year, was an enormous success and sold out its initial print run. In the first three months, Ballantine sold 3.5 million copies.

==Cartoons, comics and humor books==
After publishing &quot;The World of Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, Ballantine introduced Shel Silverstein in 1956 with his &quot;Grab Your Socks!&quot; collection of cartoons from &quot;Pacific Stars and Stripes&quot;.

As an editor at Ballantine during the 1950s and 1960s, Bernard Shir-Cliff handled the Zacherley anthologies, the paperback of Hunter Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;, Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s &quot;The Mad Reader&quot; and other early &quot;Mad&quot; paperbacks. He made four contributions to &quot;Mad&quot; and other magazines edited by Kurtzman. In 1956, Shir-Cliff edited a humor anthology, &quot;The Wild Reader&quot;, for Ballantine, including essays, poems and satirical pieces by Robert Benchley, Art Buchwald, Tom Lehrer, John Lardner, Shepherd Mead, Ogden Nash, S. J. Perelman, Frank Sullivan, James Thurber and others. The 154-page paperback was illustrated with cartoons by Kelly Freas who also did the front cover.

Another contributor to both Ballantine and the Kurtzman magazines was the cartoonist-author Roger Price. He did two humor books for Ballantine. &quot;I&#x27;m for Me First&quot; (1954) details Herman Clabbercutt&#x27;s plan to launch a revolutionary political party known as the &quot;I&#x27;m for Me First&quot; Party. &quot;In One Head and Out the Other&quot; (1954) popularized the catchphrase &quot;I had one grunch, but the eggplant over there.&quot; The nonsense non sequitur was immediately adopted by science fiction fandom, appearing occasionally in fanzines, as noted in &quot;Fancyclopedia II&quot; (1959).

Ballantine has also been the publisher of books featuring Jim Davis&#x27; comic strip &quot;Garfield&quot; since 1980.

<doc id="462698" wikidata="Q60679" url="?curid=462698" title="Harmonic divisor number">
<text>In mathematics, a harmonic divisor number or Ore number is a positive integer whose divisors have a harmonic mean that is an integer. The first few harmonic divisor numbers are
:1, 6, 28, 140, 270, 496, 672, 1638, 2970, 6200, 8128, 8190 .
Harmonic divisor numbers were introduced by Øystein Ore, who showed that every perfect number is a harmonic divisor number and conjectured that there are no odd harmonic divisor numbers other than 1.

==Examples==
The number 6 has the four divisors 1, 2, 3, and 6. Their harmonic mean is an integer:
formula_1
Thus 6 is a harmonic divisor number. Similarly, the number 140 has divisors 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 28, 35, 70, and 140. Their harmonic mean is
formula_2
Since 5 is an integer, 140 is a harmonic divisor number.

==Factorization of the harmonic mean==
The harmonic mean of the divisors of any number can be expressed as the formula
formula_3
where is the sum of th powers of the divisors of : is the number of divisors, and is the sum of divisors .
All of the terms in this formula are multiplicative but not completely multiplicative.
Therefore, the harmonic mean is also multiplicative.
This means that, for any positive integer , the harmonic mean can be expressed as the product of the harmonic means of the prime powers in the factorization of .

For instance, we have
formula_4
formula_5
formula_6
and
formula_7

== Harmonic divisor numbers and perfect numbers ==
For any integer &quot;M&quot;, as Ore observed, the product of the harmonic mean and arithmetic mean of its divisors equals &quot;M&quot; itself, as can be seen from the definitions. Therefore, &quot;M&quot; is harmonic, with harmonic mean of divisors &quot;k&quot;, if and only if the average of its divisors is the product of &quot;M&quot; with a unit fraction 1/&quot;k&quot;.

Ore showed that every perfect number is harmonic. To see this, observe that the sum of the divisors of a perfect number &quot;M&quot; is exactly &quot;2M&quot;; therefore, the average of the divisors is &quot;M&quot;(2/τ(&quot;M&quot;)), where τ(&quot;M&quot;) denotes the number of divisors of &quot;M&quot;. For any &quot;M&quot;, τ(&quot;M&quot;) is odd if and only if &quot;M&quot; is a square number, for otherwise each divisor &quot;d&quot; of &quot;M&quot; can be paired with a different divisor &quot;M&quot;/&quot;d&quot;. But no perfect number can be a square: this follows from the known form of even perfect numbers and from the fact that odd perfect numbers (if they exist) must have a factor of the form &quot;q&quot;α where α ≡ 1 (mod 4). Therefore, for a perfect number &quot;M&quot;, τ(&quot;M&quot;) is even and the average of the divisors is the product of &quot;M&quot; with the unit fraction 2/τ(&quot;M&quot;); thus, &quot;M&quot; is a harmonic divisor number.

Ore conjectured that no odd harmonic divisor numbers exist other than 1. If the conjecture is true, this would imply the nonexistence of odd perfect numbers.

== Bounds and computer searches ==

W. H. Mills (unpublished; see Muskat) showed that any odd harmonic divisor number above 1 must have a prime power factor greater than 107, and Cohen showed that any such number must have at least three different prime factors. showed that there are no odd harmonic divisor numbers smaller than 1024.

Cohen, Goto, and others starting with Ore himself have performed computer searches listing all small harmonic divisor numbers. From these results, lists are known of all harmonic divisor numbers up to 2 × 109, and all harmonic divisor numbers for which the harmonic mean of the divisors is at most 300.

<text>The Yukon Liberal Party () is a political party in the territory of Yukon, Canada. The party is not organizationally linked to the federal Liberal Party of Canada in any official manner.

==History==
After twenty years as a minor party, the Yukon Liberal Party won the 2000 general election and formed a government under Premier Pat Duncan. The government, however, was reduced to minority government status. Duncan called a snap election for November 2002 in the hope of regaining her government&#x27;s majority. The party was almost completely wiped out, however, by the Yukon Party. Duncan won the Liberals&#x27; sole seat in the Yukon Party&#x27;s landslide.

The Liberal Party remained in opposition until the 2016 general election where the party went from third place in the legislature to majority government with its leader, Sandy Silver, becoming Premier.

<doc id="462705" wikidata="Q1094399" url="?curid=462705" title="Central angle">
<text>A central angle is an angle whose apex (vertex) is the center O of a circle and whose legs (sides) are radii intersecting the circle in two distinct points A and B. Central angles are subtended by an arc between those two points, and the arc length is the central angle of a circle of radius one (measured in radians). The central angle is also known as the arc&#x27;s angular distance. The arc length spanned by a central angle on a sphere is called &quot;spherical distance&quot;.

The size of a central angle is or (radians). When defining or drawing a central angle, in addition to specifying the points and , one must specify whether the angle being defined is the convex angle (&lt;180°) or the reflex angle (&gt;180°). Equivalently, one must specify whether the movement from point to point is clockwise or counterclockwise.

==Formulas==
If the intersection points and of the legs of the angle with the circle form a diameter, then is a straight angle. (In radians, .)

Let be the minor arc of the circle between points and , and let be the radius of the circle.

If the central angle is subtended by , then 
formula_1

 \cdot 2 \pi R \, \Rightarrow \, \Theta = \left( {\frac{180L}{\pi R}} \right) ^{\circ}.&lt;/math&gt;}}


If the central angle is not subtended by the minor arc , then is a reflex angle and
formula_2

If a tangent at and a tangent at intersect at the exterior point , then denoting the center as , the angles (convex) and are supplementary (sum to 180°).

==Central angle of a regular polygon==

A regular polygon with sides has a circumscribed circle upon which all its vertices lie, and the center of the circle is also the center of the polygon. The central angle of the regular polygon is formed at the center by the radii to two adjacent vertices. The measure of this angle is formula_3

<doc id="462707" wikidata="Q614467" url="?curid=462707" title="Brush">
<text>A brush is a common tool with bristles, wire or other filaments. It generally consists of a handle or block to which filaments are affixed in either a parallel or perpendicular orientation, depending on the way the brush is to be gripped during use. The material of both the block and bristles or filaments is chosen to withstand hazards of its intended use, such as corrosive chemicals, heat or abrasion. It is used for cleaning, grooming hair, make up, painting, surface finishing and for many other purposes. It is one of the most basic and versatile tools in use today, and the average household may contain several dozen varieties.

==History==
When houses were first inhabited, homeowners used branches taken from shrubs to sweep up dirt, hence using the first brushes. In 1859, the first brush factory in America was set up in New York.

==Manufacture==
A common way of setting the bristles, brush filaments, in the brush is the staple or anchor set brush in which the filament is forced with a staple by the middle into a hole with a special driver and held there by the pressure against all of the walls of the hole and the portions of the staple nailed to the bottom of the hole. The staple can be replaced with a kind of anchor, which is a piece of rectangular profile wire that is anchored to the wall of the hole, like in most toothbrushes. Another way to attach the bristles to the surface can be found in a fused brush, in which instead of being inserted into a hole, a plastic fibre is welded to another plastic surface, giving the option to use different diameters of bristles in the same brush.

Configurations include twisted-in wire (e.g. bottle brushes), cylinders and disks (with bristles spread in one face or radially).

==By function==

===Application of material===
The action of such brushes is mostly from the sides, not the tip, contact with which releases material held by capillary action.

*Finger-print forensic brush
*Gilding brush
*Ink brush
*Makeup brush
*Mascara brush
*Nail-polish brush
*Paintbrush (fine art or house decoration)
*Pastry brush
*Shaving brush
*Shoe-polish brush (polish applicator)
*Wall-paper brush

===Combing===
The action of these brushes is more akin to combing than brushing, that is they are used to straighten and untangle filaments. Certain varieties of hairbrush are however designed to brush the scalp itself free of material such as dead skin (dandruff) and to invigorate the skin of the scalp.

* Grooming brush
* Hairbrush

===Other===
* Brush (electric), used on electrical motors
* Acid brush, described as consisting of glass threads, in 1906
*Acid brush, described as consisting of horsehair held in a crimped copper tube, in 1922
*Clothes brush or lint brush
*Magnetic brush
* Medical sampling brush
* Brush percussion mallets
* Stippling brush (neither applies nor removes material, but merely adds pattern)

==Cleaning==
Brushes used for cleaning come in various sizes, ranging from even smaller than that of a toothbrush, to the standard household version accompanied by a dustpan, to 36″ deck brushes. There are brushes for cleaning tiny cracks and crevices and brushes for cleaning enormous warehouse floors. Brushes perform a multitude of cleaning tasks. For example, brushes lightly dust the tiniest figurine, they help scrub stains out of clothing and shoes, they remove grime from tires, and they remove the dirt and debris found on floors with the help of a dust pan. Specific brushes are used for diverse activities from cleaning vegetables, as a toilet brush, washing glass, cleaning tiles, and as a mild abrasive for sanding.

<doc id="462711" wikidata="Q1449586" url="?curid=462711" title="Oliver Wood (cinematographer)">
<text>Oliver Wood (21 February 1942 – 13 February 2023) was a British cinematographer, best known for his work on blockbuster action and comedy films such as &quot;Die Hard 2, Face/Off&quot;, &quot;Freaky Friday, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot;, and the &quot;Bourne&quot; franchise. He collaborated with directors like Paul Greengrass, John Woo, Renny Harlin, Ron Underwood, and Adam McKay, and was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography for &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum.&quot;

== Life and career ==
Wood was born in London on 21 February 1942. At the age of 19, he moved to New York City. His first break came for director Leonard Kastle on cult crime film &quot;The Honeymoon Killers&quot; (1969) where he used available light to give the dark comedy a newsreel look. He shot numerous B-movies and independent films throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, frequently collaborating with cinematographers Joseph Mangine and Fred Murphy. He also worked as a camera operator on higher-profile projects including &quot;Body Rock&quot; (1984) and &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot; (1985), both of which were shot by Robby Müller. He also became a music video and commercial cinematographer, working for directors like Bob Giraldi and Rupert Wainwright.

His big break came when he was director of photography for 53 episodes of stylish crime drama &quot;Miami Vice,&quot; serving as the series primary DP between 1987 and 1989. His work on the series caught the attention of producers, enabling him to work on big-budget Hollywood films including &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; (1990), &quot;Face/Off&quot; (1997), &quot;U-571&quot; (2000) &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (2005), and &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot; (2013). He was the original director of photography on the swashbuckling action film &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot;, but suffered an on-set injury and was replaced by Peter Levy. He also shot the Bourne Trilogy, where he worked with director Paul Greengrass to produce a spontaneous, naturalistic effect, often using multiple cameras, frequently handheld, citing films such as &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot; as an influence. He was nominated for a BAFTA for &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; (2007).

In 2016, Wood shot the remake of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, directed by Timur Bekmambetov, utilizing GoPro cameras to film the movie&#x27;s action sequences. His last credit was for &quot;Morbius&quot; (2022).

==Death==
Wood died from cancer at his home in Los Angeles, California on 13 February 2023 at the age of 80. He is survived by his wife, Sabina Groh; his daughters, Katharine Wood and Fiona Wood; and his son, Emerson Forth.

<doc id="462720" wikidata="Q2831153" url="?curid=462720" title="Albert Einstein Institution">
<text>The Albert Einstein Institution (AEI) is a non-profit organization specializing in the study of the methods of nonviolent resistance in conflict. It was founded by scholar Gene Sharp in 1983, and named after Albert Einstein.

Until 2000, the institute provided funding for Einstein Institution Fellowships for scholars, sometimes referred to as Einstein Fellows, and was also the funding body for the Program on Nonviolent Sanctions in Conflict and Defense at Harvard&#x27;s Center for International Affairs.

Jamila Raqib has been executive director since 2005.

==History==
The research institute is named after the physicist Albert Einstein, who was a committed pacifist, although not an &quot;absolute pacifist&quot;; he recognized that pacifism would not work against Hitler in 1933. It was founded by political scientist Gene Sharp, whose first book, about the methods of Indian pacifist Gandhi, included an article on nonviolence signed by Einstein as a preface.

The AEI was incorporated in July 1983, two months after the Program on Nonviolent Sanctions in Conflict and Defense was created at the Center for International Affairs (CFIA) (now the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, or WCFIA) at Harvard University. This program operated as a research division under the framework and policies of the center, with its focus the use of nonviolent sanctions as a substitute for violent interventions. The Program provided grants or fellowships for scholars in residence, as well as conducting seminars and conferences. For the first few years, the Program at the CFIA lobbied for funding itself, as well as obtaining some funding from the AEI; after 1987 policy changes were made to reduce confusion and the AEI became solely responsible for raising the funds to support the CFIA Program as well as its own activities.

Around 2004, one of its major donors, former student of Sharp and co-founder of International Center on Nonviolent Conflict in 2002, businessman Peter Ackerman, withdrew his funding, and Sharp started running the institute out of his home in Boston.

Jamila Raqib joined AEI in 2002, at first managing the promotion of its publications and translations. In 2005 she became its executive director, and in 2009 collaborated with Sharp to publish &quot;Self-Liberation: A Guide to Strategic Planning for Action to End a Dictatorship or Other Oppression&quot;, which has been translated into several languages.

Sharp remained as senior scholar at AEI until his death in 2018.

==Governance==
The articles of incorporation stated that institution is an independent non-profit organization, to be publicly funded and to act as &quot;a grant-making and grant seeking organization&quot;.

, Jamila Raqib is executive director, and Cornelia Sargent is chair.

==Aims and work==
The institution &quot;is committed to the defense of freedom, democracy, and the reduction of political violence through the use of nonviolent action&quot;, and looks at ways by which nonviolent means can be employed to deal with problems such as &quot;aggression, dictatorship, genocide and oppression.

In order to achieve its aims, it encourages research and policy studies on the methods of nonviolent action; shares the results of this research with the public; and engages with groups that are in conflict, about the possible use of nonviolent action as a strategy. It prepares, translates, presents and publishes educational resources, and publishes books, pamphlets, conference proceedings and other materials.

It has consulted with pro-democracy groups from countries such as the Baltic states, Burma, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Iraq Serbia, Thailand, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

==Fellowships==

The Albert Einstein Institution provided a number of Einstein Institution Fellowships to scholars working on various aspects of nonviolent struggle. This was an honorary position, and the Einstein Institution Fellows were either paid only a modest stipend, or not at all in the first few years. Between 1983 and 1988 Einstein Institution Fellows included Nathan Stoltzfus and Alex P. Schmid, who published the revised edition of &quot;Political Terrorism&quot; based on his work undertaken as a Fellow.

In late 1988, the Fellowship program was expanded into a continuing, international, competitive program, appointing fellows annually. This continued through until 2000, but owing to diminishing funding, the 1999–2000 Einstein Fellows appear to be the last.

==In film==
A feature documentary by Scottish director, Ruaridh Arrow, &quot;How to Start a Revolution&quot;, about the global influence of the Albert Einstein Institution and Sharp&#x27;s work was released in September 2011. The film won &quot;Best Documentary&quot; and &quot;The Mass Impact Award&quot; at the Boston Film Festival in September 2011. The European premiere was held at London&#x27;s Raindance Film Festival on October 2, 2011, where it also won Best Documentary. It went on to be screened at Occupy camps across the US and Europe, including at the Bank of Ideas in London. The film has been described as the unofficial film of the Occupy Wall St movement, being shown in Occupy camps in cities all over the world.

==Criticism==
In 2007 former Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez accused the Albert Einstein Institution of being behind a &quot;soft coup&quot; attempt in Venezuela. The Albert Einstein Institution have dismissed such accusations. In response to the accusations against the institution, professor Stephen Zunes initiated a petition titled &quot;Open Letter in Support of Gene Sharp and Strategic Nonviolent Action&quot; which expresses support for Dr Sharp and the Albert Einstein Institution. The petition was signed by many prominent left-wing scholars and activists, including Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky.

<doc id="462729" wikidata="Q7437611" url="?curid=462729" title="Scottish Agricultural Revolution">
<text>The Agricultural Revolution in Scotland was a series of changes in agricultural practice that began in the 17th century and continued in the 19th century. They began with the improvement of Scottish Lowlands farmland and the beginning of a transformation of Scottish agriculture from one of the least modernised systems to what was to become the most modern and productive system in Europe. The traditional system of agriculture in Scotland generally used the runrig system of management, which had possibly originated in the Late Middle Ages. The basic pre-improvement farming unit was the (in the Highlands) and the fermetoun (in the Lowlands). In each, a small number of families worked open-field arable and shared grazing. Whilst run rig varied in its detail from place to place, the common defining detail was the sharing out by lot on a regular (probably annual) basis of individual parts (&quot;rigs&quot;) of the arable land so that families had intermixed plots in different parts of the field.

==Use of the term==
The term Scottish Agricultural Revolution was used in the early 20th century primarily to refer to the period of most dramatic change in the second half of the 18th century and early 19th century. More recently historians have become aware of a longer processes, with change beginning in the late 17th century and continuing into the mid-19th century. The expansion of the period covered has led some to question the concept of a revolution.

==History==
===17th century===

Before the 17th century, with difficult terrain, poor roads and methods of transport there was little trade between different areas of the country and most settlements depended on what was produced locally, often with little in reserve in bad years. Most farming was based on the lowland fermtoun or highland baile, settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs, of &quot;runs&quot; (furrows) and &quot;rigs&quot; (ridges), to tenant farmers. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective in the heavy Scottish soil, and cheaper to feed than horses. Those with property rights included husbandmen, lesser landholders and free tenants. Below them were the cottars, who often shared rights to common pasture, occupied small portions of land and participated in joint farming as hired labour. Farms also might have grassmen, who had rights only to grazing. Three acts of parliament passed in 1695 allowed the consolidation of runrigs and the division of common land.

===18th century===

After the union with England in 1707, there was a conscious attempt among the gentry and nobility to improve agriculture in Scotland. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords. In the first half of the century these changes were limited to tenanted farms in East Lothian and the estates of a few enthusiasts, such as John Cockburn and Archibald Grant. Not all were successful, with Cockburn driving himself into bankruptcy, but the ethos of improvement spread among the landed classes.
The English plough was introduced along with foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture. There was increasing specialisation, with the Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breeding and The Borders of sheep.

Although some estate holders improved the quality of life of their displaced workers, the Agricultural Revolution led directly to what is increasingly becoming known as the Lowland Clearances, with hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland emigrating from the farms and small holdings their families had occupied for hundreds of years, or adapting them to the Scottish Agricultural Revolution.

===19th century===

Improvement continued in the 19th century. Innovations included the first working reaping machine, developed by Patrick Bell in 1828. His rival James Smith turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production and the result was the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.

While the Lowlands had seen widespread agricultural improvement, the financially broken Highland lairds took to replacing Highland agricultural practice with its own system of labour with Lowland agricultural practice plus labour in the Highland Clearances. A handful of powerful families, typified by the dukes of Argyll, Atholl, Buccleuch, and Sutherland, owned enormous sections of Scotland and had extensive influence on political affairs (certainly up to 1885). As late as 1878, 68 families owned nearly half the land in Scotland. Particularly after the end of the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society. They turned to money rents and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans.
One result of these changes were the Highland Clearances, in which many tenants in the Highlands were evicted as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the UK, though were notorious as a result of the introduction of Lowland farmhands or practice into Highland agricultural land or practice, plus the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, and the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system. The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, or further afield to England, Canada, America or Australia.

==Consequences==
The Lowland and Highland Clearances meant that many small settlements were dismantled, their occupants forced either to the new purpose-built villages built by the landowners such as John Cockburn&#x27;s Ormiston or Archibald Grant&#x27;s Monymusk on the outskirts of the new ranch-style farms, or to the new industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh, or northern England. Tens of thousands of others emigrated to Canada or the United States, finding opportunities to own and farm their own land. In the Highlands, many that remained were now crofters, living on very small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals. For these families kelping, fishing, spinning of linen and military service became important sources of additional revenue.

<text>In geometry, an inscribed angle is the angle formed in the interior of a circle when two chords intersect on the circle. It can also be defined as the angle subtended at a point on the circle by two given points on the circle.

Equivalently, an inscribed angle is defined by two chords of the circle sharing an endpoint.

The inscribed angle theorem relates the measure of an inscribed angle to that of the central angle intercepting the same arc.

The inscribed angle theorem appears as Proposition 20 in Book 3 of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;.

Note that this theorem is not to be confused with the Angle bisector theorem, which also involves angle bisection (but of an angle of a triangle not inscribed in a circle).

==Theorem==

===Statement===

The inscribed angle theorem states that an angle inscribed in a circle is half of the central angle that intercepts the same arc on the circle. Therefore, the angle does not change as its vertex is moved to different positions on the same arc of the circle.

===Proof===

====Inscribed angles where one chord is a diameter====

Let be the center of a circle, as in the diagram at right. Choose two points on the circle, and call them and . Designate point to be diametrically opposite point . Draw chord , a diameter containing point . Draw chord . Angle is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc ; denote it as . Draw line . Angle is a central angle that also intercepts arc ; denote it as .

Lines and are both radii of the circle, so they have equal lengths. Therefore, triangle is isosceles, so angle and angle are equal.

Angles and are supplementary, summing to a straight angle (180°), so angle measures .

The three angles of triangle must sum to:

formula_1

Adding formula_2 to both sides yields

formula_3

====Inscribed angles with the center of the circle in their interior====

Given a circle whose center is point , choose three points on the circle. Draw lines and : angle is an inscribed angle. Now draw line and extend it past point so that it intersects the circle at point . Angle intercepts arc on the circle.

Suppose this arc includes point within it. Point is diametrically opposite to point . Angles are also inscribed angles, but both of these angles have one side which passes through the center of the circle, therefore the theorem from the above Part 1 can be applied to them.

Therefore,

formula_4

then let

formula_5

so that

formula_6

Draw lines and . Angle is a central angle, but so are angles and , and
formula_7

Let

formula_8

so that

formula_9

From Part One we know that formula_10 and that formula_11. Combining these results with equation (2) yields

formula_12

therefore, by equation (1),

formula_13

====Inscribed angles with the center of the circle in their exterior====

The previous case can be extended to cover the case where the measure of the inscribed angle is the &quot;difference&quot; between two inscribed angles as discussed in the first part of this proof.

Given a circle whose center is point , choose three points on the circle. Draw lines and : angle is an inscribed angle. Now draw line and extend it past point so that it intersects the circle at point . Angle intercepts arc on the circle.

Suppose this arc does not include point within it. Point is diametrically opposite to point . Angles are also inscribed angles, but both of these angles have one side which passes through the center of the circle, therefore the theorem from the above Part 1 can be applied to them.

Therefore,

formula_14

then let

formula_15

so that

formula_16

Draw lines and . Angle is a central angle, but so are angles and , and

formula_17

Let

formula_18

so that

formula_19

From Part One we know that formula_10 and that formula_11. Combining these results with equation (4) yields
formula_22
therefore, by equation (3),
formula_13


===Corollary===
By a similar argument, the angle between a chord and the tangent line at one of its intersection points equals half of the central angle subtended by the chord. See also Tangent lines to circles.

==Applications==

The inscribed angle theorem is used in many proofs of elementary Euclidean geometry of the plane. A special case of the theorem is Thales&#x27;s theorem, which states that the angle subtended by a diameter is always 90°, i.e., a right angle. As a consequence of the theorem, opposite angles of cyclic quadrilaterals sum to 180°; conversely, any quadrilateral for which this is true can be inscribed in a circle. As another example, the inscribed angle theorem is the basis for several theorems related to the power of a point with respect to a circle. Further, it allows one to prove that when two chords intersect in a circle, the products of the lengths of their pieces are equal.

== Inscribed angle theorems for ellipses, hyperbolas and parabolas ==
Inscribed angle theorems exist for ellipses, hyperbolas and parabolas too. The essential differences are the measurements of an angle. (An angle is considered a pair of intersecting lines.)

<text>Tinariwen (Tamasheq: ; with vowels ; plural of ténéré meaning &quot;desert&quot;) is a collective of Tuareg musicians from the Sahara region of southern Algeria and of northern Mali, in the region of Azawad. Considered pioneers of desert blues, the group&#x27;s guitar-driven style combines traditional Tuareg and African music with Western rock music. The collective first convened in the late 1970s and released their first studio album in the early 1990s. They began touring internationally in the early 2000s.

The group was founded by Ibrahim Ag Alhabib; he and bandmates Alhassane Ag Touhami and Abdallah Ag Alhousseyni have all been present since 1979. Tinariwen first started to gain a following outside the Sahara region in 2001 with the release of the album &quot;The Radio Tisdas Sessions.&quot; Their most recent album &quot;Amatssou&quot; was released in 2023.

The group has been nominated for Grammy Awards three times, and their 2012 album &quot;Tassili&quot; won the award for Best World Music Album in 2012. NPR calls the group &quot;music&#x27;s true rebels&quot;, AllMusic deems the group&#x27;s music &quot;a grassroots voice of rebellion&quot;, and &quot;Slate&quot; calls the group &quot;rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll rebels whose rebellion, for once, wasn&#x27;t just metaphorical&quot;.

==Biography==

===Background===
At four years old, Ibrahim Ag Alhabib witnessed the execution of his father, a Tuareg rebel, during a 1963 uprising in Mali. After seeing a western film in which a cowboy played a guitar, Ag Alhabib built his own guitar out of a &quot;plastic water can, a stick and some fishing wire&quot;, according to future bandmate Abdallah Ag Alhousseyni. During his childhood, Ag Alhabib lived in Algeria in refugee camps near Bordj Badji Mokhtar and in the deserts around the southern city of Tamanrasset, where he was given a guitar by an Algerian man, who also taught him how to play the Algerian style of Tergui music.

Later, Ag Alhabib resided in Algeria and Libya with other Tuareg exiles. He acquired his first real acoustic guitar in 1979. During this period he formed a band with Alhassane Ag Touhami and brothers Inteyeden and Liya Ag Ablil to play at parties and weddings. While the group had no official name, people began to call them Kel Tinariwen, which in the Tamashek language translates as &quot;The People of the Deserts&quot; or &quot;The Desert Boys&quot;.

In 1980 Libyan ruler Muammar al-Gaddafi put out a decree inviting all young Tuareg men who were living illegally in Libya to receive full military training. Gaddafi dreamed of forming a Saharan regiment, made up of young Tuareg fighters, to further his territorial ambitions in Chad, Niger, and elsewhere in the region. Ag Alhabib and his bandmates answered the call and received nine months of training. During such exercises, the band met additional Tuareg musicians and formed a loosely-organized collective to create songs about the issues facing the Tuareg people. They built a makeshift studio and vowed to record music for free for anyone who supplied a blank cassette tape. The resulting homemade cassettes were traded widely throughout the Sahara region.

In 1989 the collective left Libya and moved to Ag Alhabib&#x27;s home country of Mali, where he returned to his home village of Tessalit for the first time in 26 years. In 1990 the Tuareg people of Mali revolted against the government, with some of the musicians of the collective participating as rebel fighters. After a peace agreement known as the Tamanrasset Accords was reached in January 1991, the musicians left the rebel movement and devoted themselves to music full-time. In 1991, some members of Tinariwen went to Abidjan, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, to record a cassette at JBZ Studios and the album &quot;Kel Tinariwen&quot; was released later that year. They played occasional gigs for far-flung Tuareg communities throughout the Sahara region, gaining word-of-mouth popularity among the Tuareg people.

===1998–2009: International recognition===
In 1993, the Tuareg humanitarian Manny Ansar became the group&#x27;s manager. Ansar initially organized concerts for the collective in Bamako, until realizing that there was international demand for Tuareg music. Tinariwen was then organized as an official band with about a dozen named members. In 1998, Tinariwen came to the attention of the French world music ensemble Lo&#x27;Jo and their manager Philippe Brix. That group traveled to a music festival in Bamako and met two members of the Tinariwen collective. In 1999, some members of Tinariwen traveled to France and performed with Lo&#x27;Jo under the name Azawad.

In 2001, Ansar organized the inaugural Festival au Désert in Tin Essako, Mali, in collaboration with Lo&#x27;Jo and the Belgian Sfinks Festival, with Tinariwen headlining. Their debut full-length album, &quot;The Radio Tisdas Sessions&quot;, was recorded by Justin Adams and Jean-Paul Romann at the radio station of the same name in Kidal, Mali (the only Tamashek-speaking station in the region) and released in 2001. It was Tinariwen&#x27;s first recording to be released outside of northern Africa.

Since 2001 Tinariwen have toured regularly in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia. Also since 2001 the collective has added several younger Tuareg musicians who did not live through the military conflicts experienced by the older members but have contributed to the collective&#x27;s multi-generational evolution. Newer members include bassist Eyadou Ag Leche, percussionist Said Ag Ayad, guitarist Elaga Ag Hamid, and guitarist Abdallah Ag Lamida.

Their 2004 album &quot;Amassakoul&quot; (&quot;The Traveller&quot; in Tamashek) and their 2007 album &quot;Aman Iman&quot; (&quot;Water Is Life&quot;) were released worldwide and gained the notice of celebrity fans including Carlos Santana, Robert Plant, Bono, the Edge, Thom Yorke, Chris Martin, Henry Rollins, Brian Eno, and members of TV on the Radio. In 2005, Tinariwen received a BBC Award for World Music, and in 2008 they received Germany&#x27;s prestigious Praetorius Music Prize. The band&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;&quot; was recorded in a mobile studio by Jean-Paul Romann in Tessalit. The band appeared at the Glastonbury Festival in 2009.

===2010–present===

In 2010, Tinariwen represented Algeria in the opening ceremony of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, and completed a lengthy American tour. The band released their fifth album &quot;Tassili&quot; in 2011, featuring guest appearances by Nels Cline, The Dirty Dozen Brass Band, and Tunde Adebimpe and Kyp Malone of TV on the Radio. Ian Brennan produced the album. The album won the Award for Best World Music Album at the 54th Grammy Awards. Their world tour in 2011 included performances at the End of the Road Festival and All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties. Tinariwen appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on 29 November 2011 with Adebimpe and Malone to play two songs from &quot;Tassili&quot;. Group members Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, Alhassane Ag Touhami, and Eyadou Ag Leche participated in a translated interview with Colbert. They appeared at the January 2012 Festival au Désert, where they were joined on stage by Bono and Bassekou Kouyate. 

In early 2012 there was another Tuareg rebellion in Tinariwen&#x27;s home region of northern Mali, with the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad declaring independence and forming the short-lived unrecognized state Azawad. Another party in the rebellion, the militant Islamist group Ansar Dine, denounced the presence of popular music in the territory, and Tinariwen was targeted specifically during this campaign. During this period, Tinariwen had scheduled a tour of Australia and New Zealand, but Ibrahim Ag Alhabib and Elaga Al Hamid were not able to get out of Mali due to the conflict. Members of Lo&#x27;Jo joined the rest of Tinariwen on stage at the WOMADelaide festival. 

In a January 2013 confrontation with Ansar Dine militants, who had denounced Tinariwen and their music, Abdallah Ag Lamida was abducted while trying to save his guitars. A few weeks later, Tinariwen reported that Ag Lamida had been released and was &quot;safe and free&quot;. During Ag Lamida&#x27;s captivity, several other members of Tinariwen fled from the conflict and resettled temporarily in the southwestern United States to record their sixth album, &quot;Emmaar,&quot; with guests including Josh Klinghoffer, Fats Kaplin, Matt Sweeney, and Saul Williams. Recording took place at Joshua Tree National Park in California, which features a desert environment similar to that of Tinariwen&#x27;s homeland. &quot;Emmaar&quot; was released worldwide in 2014. Tinariwen then embarked on a tour of Europe and North America, but without group leader Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, who decided to remain in Mali to attend to family issues caused by the latest political crisis. Bassist Eyadou Ag Leche assumed the role of musical director, and a new singer/guitarist named Iyad Abderrahmane was recruited to perform Ag Alhabib&#x27;s parts during the tour.

In 2016, the group returned to Joshua Tree National Park to record parts of their seventh album, &quot;Elwan&quot;, with additional recording in France and the remote settlement of M&#x27;Hamid El Ghizlane in southern Morocco (home of the Festival Taragalte). The album was released in 2017 and featured guest appearances by Matt Sweeney, Kurt Vile, Mark Lanegan, and Alain Johannes. Tinariwen then embarked on an American tour with Dengue Fever as support. The group toured Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand through 2018, with another appearance at WOMADelaide. After the international tour, Tinariwen were unable to return to their home area in northern Mali due to ongoing sectarian violence and threats from Islamist militants. The group instead decamped in Morocco and embarked on a multi-month journey through Western Sahara and Mauritania, collaborating with local musicians at several stops along the way and writing songs while camped out in the desert.

Their eighth album, &quot;Amadjar&quot;, was recorded outdoors with mobile equipment near Nouakchott, Mauritania and was released in 2019. &quot;Amadjar&quot; featured guest appearances by Noura Mint Seymali, Micah Nelson, Cass McCombs, Stephen O&#x27;Malley, and Warren Ellis. In 2022, Tinariwen began a project to reissue several of their earlier albums in new formats; the first such release was the album &quot;Kel Tinariwen&quot;, which collects several of the group&#x27;s early recordings from the 1990s. Their ninth album, &quot;Amatssou&quot;, was produced by Daniel Lanois and was released in May 2023. Another world tour included a performance at the Glastonbury Festival.

On 28 August 2024 the group performed at one of the Late Night Proms at the Royal Albert Hall in London. A compilation of early demos and rarities titled &quot;Idrache (Traces of the Past)&quot; was released in November 2024.

==Musical style and influence==
Tinariwen&#x27;s sound is primarily guitar-driven, in the style known as &quot;assouf&quot; among the Tuareg people. The group&#x27;s guitar style has its roots in West African music and other traditional styles practiced by the Tuareg and Berber peoples, and has often been characterized as &quot;desert blues&quot;. Tinariwen was also influenced by traditional Malian musicians, most notably Ali Farka Touré, and regional pop singers like Rabah Driassa. While the Tinariwen style is possibly a distant relative of blues music, via West African music, members of Tinariwen claim to have never heard actual American blues music until they began to travel internationally in the early 2000s. Tinariwen was also influenced by American and British rock acts whose bootlegged albums had made it to the Sahara region, such as Dire Straits, Santana, Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, and Jimi Hendrix.

Tinariwen has been named as a formative influence on a growing Tuareg rock scene, made up of younger musicians who were not rebels like the members of Tinariwen but have experienced their region&#x27;s recent struggles with poverty and terrorism. The band Imarhan is led by Sadam Iyad Moussa Ben Abderamane, who has collaborated with Tinariwen and is the nephew of bassist Eyadu ag Leche. Kel Assouf and Tamikrest have gained notice as younger Tuareg rock bands that cite Tinariwen as a fundamental influence. The band Terakaft also consists of several musicians who have played with Tinariwen.

==Band members==

Tinariwen is a collective of singers, songwriters, and musicians who come together in different combinations to play concerts and to record. This is because of the nomadic lifestyle of the Tuareg people and the difficulties of transportation and communication in the Sahara region. The group rarely brings a consistent line-up on its international tours, though several members tour regularly.

<text>Czarnków is a town in Poland in Czarnków-Trzcianka County in Greater Poland Voivodeship. As of December 2021, the town has 10,279 inhabitants.

The town lies on the Noteć river. Because there are many hills around the town, the area is called &quot;Szwajcaria Czarnkowska&quot; (&quot;Czarnków&#x27;s Switzerland&quot;).

==History==

The area was included within the emerging Polish state in the 10th century by its first historic ruler Mieszko I of Poland. 
An early Polish stronghold and settlement were founded in the 10th century. In the early 12th century, it was a stronghold of pagan Pomeranians, ruled by local Pomeranian ruler Gniewomir. It was reconquered by Polish Duke Bolesław III Wrymouth in 1108, and shortly after it was noted for the first time in the early 12th century &quot;Gesta principum Polonorum&quot; by Gallus Anonymus, the oldest Polish chronicle. Czarnków developed at the intersection of trade routes connecting Poznań with Pomerania and Wieleń with Nakło nad Notecią. During the fragmentation of Piast-ruled Poland it formed part of the Duchy of Greater Poland, and afterwards, it was made a private town, administratively located in the Poznań County in the Poznań Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland. From 1244 until 1407 Czarnków was the seat of a castellany.

In the late 13th century Polish monarch Władysław I Łokietek granted Czarnków to the Polish noble family of Nałęcz, which then changed its name to Czarnkowski after the town. The Czarnkowski family built a new castle (first time noted in 1331 and destroyed at the end of the 17th century) and established town privileges before 1369. Czarnków remained a private town of the Czarnkowski family until the mid-17th century, and the family&#x27;s Nałęcz coat of arms remains the town&#x27;s coat of arms to this day. In the 16th (or 15th) century the family erected the Gothic Saint Mary Magdalene church, which became its official burial site, and it is the most distinctive historic landmark of the town. Afterwards, the town was owned by the Polish families of Grzymułtowski, Gembicki, Naramowski, Poniatowski, Świniarski. In the 17th century Protestant refugees from Silesia settled in the town and helped develop its cloth industry.

The town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the First Partition of Poland in 1772. Following the successful Greater Poland uprising of 1806, it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, in 1815 it was re-annexed by Prussia, and was the centre of Kreis Czarnikau; from 1871 to 1919 it also formed part of the German Empire. Poland regained independence after World War I in 1918, and during the Greater Poland uprising (1918–19) the town was recaptured by Polish insurgents. 21 Polish insurgents died in battle in Czarnków. Afterwards it was divided by the new German-Polish border. The western part of the town remained within Weimar Germany and was renamed &quot;Deutsch Czarnikau&quot; in 1920 and &quot;Scharnikau&quot; in 1937, while Polish Czarnków became a county seat within the Poznań Voivodeship.

During the German occupation (World War II), in November 1939, the Germans murdered many inhabitants of Czarnków during large massacres of Poles carried out in Mędzisko as part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;. In August 1944, the Germans carried out mass arrests of local members of the Home Army, the leading Polish underground resistance organization. Czarnków was eventually liberated in January 1945, and then restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. Edmund Maron, commander of the local Home Army unit, who was not arrested by the Germans, was arrested by the communists in August 1945, and then imprisoned.

From 1975 to 1998, the town was administratively located in the Piła Voivodeship. In August 1980, employees of local factories joined the nationwide anti-communist strikes, which led to the foundation of the Solidarity organization, which played a central role at the end of communist rule in Poland.

<doc id="462749" wikidata="Q1424066" url="?curid=462749" title="Hilary and Jackie">
<text>Hilary and Jackie is a 1998 British biographical film directed by Anand Tucker, starring Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths as the British classical musician sisters Jacqueline du Pré (cello) and Hilary du Pré (flute). The film covers Jacqueline&#x27;s meteoric rise to fame, her alleged affair with Hilary&#x27;s husband Christopher Finzi, and her struggle with multiple sclerosis starting in her late 20s ultimately leading to her death at the age of 42.

Frank Cottrell-Boyce wrote the screenplay at the same time that siblings Hilary and Piers du Pré were working on their memoir, published in 1997 as &quot;A Genius in the Family&quot; (later republished under the title &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot;). As such, the film&#x27;s closing credits states that it is based on the memoir, though Cottrell-Boyce confirmed, in a programme distributed at early showings of the film, that: &quot;Hilary was working on the book at the same time as I was working on the film ... it was at a very early stage when we were doing the script&quot;. The film was not intended as a documentary and thus, unlike the book, does not claim to be the true story and includes some fictionalised incidents.

When it was released, the film attracted controversy when several personal friends of Jacqueline publicly condemned it for allegedly distorting details in her life, while Hilary publicly defended it as her and Piers&#x27;s version of the family&#x27;s story.

&quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot; generally received critical acclaim, and both Griffiths and Watson were nominated for an Academy Award, for Best Supporting Actress and Best Actress, respectively.

==Plot==
In 1960s London, Derek and Iris du Pré support their daughters, Hilary and Jackie, in pursuing music professionally after being instructed throughout their childhoods by their mother; the flute for Hilary, and the cello for Jackie. Though Jackie rebelled against practising as a child, she became a virtuoso in early adulthood, quickly rising to international prominence.

While Jackie tours throughout Europe, Hilary remains in London with her parents and brother, Piers, and struggles in her musical studies at the Royal Academy of Music. She becomes acquainted with a gregarious fellow student, Kiffer Finzi, son of composer Gerald Finzi, and the two begin a romantic relationship. Hilary begins playing in a community orchestra, where she garners local fame. Jackie returns home from touring in Moscow, and pleads with Hilary to share a flat with her. Instead, Hilary marries Kiffer, and the two relocate to a farmhouse in the country to start a family. Meanwhile, Jackie begins dating pianist and conductor Danny Barenboim, with whom she bonds over their mutual love of music. Her eventual conversion to Judaism and subsequent marriage to Danny, garners significant publicity.

Later, Jackie arrives unannounced at Hilary and Kiffer&#x27;s home, inexplicably forgoing scheduled engagements she has in Los Angeles. She confides to Hilary that she wants to have sex with Kiffer, and makes attempts to seduce him. The next day, Hilary finds Jackie stripped naked in the woods in the midst of an emotional breakdown. Danny arrives and attempts to console her, but she is indifferent to him. Jackie remains at Hilary&#x27;s home, and Hilary consents to Jackie having a sexual encounter with Kiffer, hoping it will help her work through her nervous breakdown. This, however, ultimately drives a rift between the sisters as the affair becomes emotionally suffused. Jackie leaves and resumes touring, but yearns for a different life.

From Jackie&#x27;s perspective, Hilary chose a life with Kiffer over their relationship. While Jackie finds solace in her marriage to Danny, she began to notice a subtle yet progressive deterioration of her motor skills and hand-eye coordination. It had in fact been unspoken anxieties over her health that led to her previous visit to Hilary&#x27;s.

During a live performance, Jackie finds herself unable to stand, and has to be carried offstage by Danny. She is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and Hilary goes to visit her in hospital. Jackie remains optimistic about her diagnosis, but the disease progresses rapidly, leaving her unable to position her fingers or use a bow. Danny continues to conduct around the world, and Jackie finds he is having an affair. As her disease progresses, she becomes paralysed before becoming deaf and mute. One autumn night, in 1987, Hilary and Piers go to visit Jackie. Holding Jackiewho is in the throes of tremorsHilary recounts a cherished childhood memory of the two playing on the beach. Shortly after, Hilary and Piers hear news of Jackie&#x27;s death on the radio. The film ends with Jackie&#x27;s spirit standing on the beach where she used to play as a child, watching herself and her sister frolicking on the sand as little girls.

==Cast==

==Production==
Scenes were filmed in the Blue Coat School, the County Sessions House, George&#x27;s Dock, St. George&#x27;s Hall, and the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. Additional scenes were filmed at the Royal Academy of Music and Wigmore Hall in London, and most interiors were shot at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. Brithdir Mawr, an ancient house in north Wales, was used for location shots of Hilary&#x27;s house.

Classical pieces performed in the film include compositions by Edward Elgar, Joseph Haydn, Johann Sebastian Bach, Johannes Brahms, César Franck, Matthias Georg Monn, Georg Friedrich Händel, Robert Schumann, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Antonín Dvořák. Jacqueline du Pré&#x27;s cello in the movie was played and synchronised to Emily Watson&#x27;s movements by Caroline Dale.

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot; was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on 22 January 1999 and grossed £1 million ($1.6 million). In the United States, it premiered on 30 December 1998 in a limited release. In the United States and Canada, the film grossed US$4,912,892 (£2.9 million) at the box office.

===Critical response===
In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden called the film &quot;one of the most insightful and wrenching portraits of the joys and tribulations of being a classical musician ever filmed&quot; and &quot;an astoundingly rich and subtle exploration of sibling rivalry and the volcanic collisions of love and resentment, competitiveness and mutual dependence that determine their lives.&quot; He went on to say &quot;&quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot; is as beautifully acted as it is directed, edited and written.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described it as &quot;an extraordinary film [that] makes no attempt to soften the material or make it comforting through the cliches of melodrama.&quot;

In the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Edward Guthmann stated, &quot;Watson is riveting and heartbreaking. Assisted by Tucker&#x27;s elegant direction and Boyce&#x27;s thoughtful, scrupulous writing, she gives a knockout performance.&quot;

Anthony Lane of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said, &quot;The sense of period, of ungainly English pride, is funny and acute, but the movie mislays its sense of wit as the girls grow up. The nub of the tale... feels both overblown and oddly beside the point; it certainly means that Tucker takes his eye, or his ear, off the music. The whole picture, indeed, is more likely to gratify the emotionally prurient than to appease lovers of Beethoven and Elgar.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated the film A− and added, &quot;This unusual, unabashedly voluptuous biographical drama, a bravura feature debut for British TV director Anand Tucker, soars on two virtuoso performances: by the rightfully celebrated Emily Watson . . . and by the under-celebrated Rachel Griffiths.&quot;

Rana Dasgupta wrote in an essay about biographical films that &quot;the film&#x27;s tagline – &#x27;The true story of two sisters who shared a passion, a madness and a man&#x27; – is a good indication of its prurient intent. The book&#x27;s moving account of love and solidarity, whose characters are incomplete and complex but not &quot;mad&quot;, is rejected in favour of a salacious account of social deviance.&quot;

===Controversy===
Although the film was a critical success, and received two Academy Award nominations, it ignited a furore, especially in London, centre of du Pre&#x27;s performing life. A group of her closest colleagues, including fellow cellists Mstislav Rostropovich and Julian Lloyd Webber, sent a &quot;bristling&quot; letter to &quot;The Times&quot; in February 1999. Webber noted in an article published in &quot;The Telegraph&quot;:
Clare Finzi, Hilary du Pré&#x27;s daughter, charged that the film was a &quot;gross misinterpretation, which I cannot let go unchallenged.&quot; Daniel Barenboim said, &quot;Couldn&#x27;t they have waited until I was dead?&quot; Additionally, a friend of Jacqueline du Pré&#x27;s, guitarist John Williams, in an interview for &quot;The Observer&quot;, called the film &quot;macabre&quot; and &quot;sick&quot;, adding: &quot;My friend Jackie has been betrayed&quot;.

Hilary du Pré wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;At first I could not understand why people didn&#x27;t believe my story because I had set out to tell the whole truth. When you tell someone the truth about your family, you don&#x27;t expect them to turn around and say that it&#x27;s bunkum. But I knew that Jackie would have respected what I had done. If I had gone for half-measures, she would have torn it up. She would have wanted the complete story to be told.&quot; Jay Fielden reported in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that she&#x27;d said, &quot;When you love someone, you love the whole of them. Those who are against the film want to look only at the pieces of Jackie&#x27;s life that they accept. I don’t think the film has taken any liberties at all. Jackie would have absolutely loved it.&quot;

<text>Earl of Egmont was a title in the Peerage of Ireland, created in 1733 for John Perceval, 1st Viscount Perceval. It became extinct with the death of the twelfth earl in 2011.

==History==

The Percevals claimed descent from an ancient Anglo-Norman family, a branch of the House of Yvery. This branch of the family traces its lineage to David Perceval, Lord of Tykenham, Rolleston, Sydenham, Moreland, Weley, and Wolmerton in Somerset, in the 16th century. His grandson, Sir Richard Percivale (1550–1620), agent of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, deciphered coded letters that gave Queen Elizabeth I the first intelligence of the Spanish Armada of 1588.
Richard Percivale served as Secretary of the Court of Wards and Registrar of the Court of Wards in Ireland, where he acquired large estates.

Sir Richard&#x27;s son, Sir Philip Perceval (1605–1647), obtained grants of forfeited lands in Ireland to the amount of 101,000 statute acres. On 9 September 1661 his eldest son, John Perceval, was created a Baronet, of Kanturk in the County of Cork, in the Baronetage of Ireland. The baronetcy was created by patent with a clause specifying that the eldest son, or grandson, would become a baronet after the age of 21, and during the lifetime of the father or grandfather, as the case would be.

Robert (1657–1677), second son of the first baronet, was assassinated in 1677 by an unknown hand, in the Strand, London. The first baronet was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baronet, who died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baronet. He also died at an early age and was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Baronet. He died at the age of nine and the titles were inherited by his younger brother, the fifth Baronet, John Perceval (1683-1748). He represented County Cork in the Irish House of Commons and Harwich in the British House of Commons; he also served as the first President of the trustees of the Georgia colony. Perceval was created Baron Perceval, of Burton in the County of Cork, in 1715, with remainder to the heirs male of his father, and Viscount Perceval, of Kanturk in the County of Cork, in 1722, and Earl of Egmont in 1733, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. All three titles were in the Peerage of Ireland. Perceval claimed descent from the Egmonts of Holland but the title of the earldom was taken from a place in County Cork
where the family owned an estate.

His son John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont (1711-1770), became a prominent politician and notably served as First Lord of the Admiralty from 1763 to 1766. In 1762 he was created Baron Lovel and Holland, of Enmore in the County of Somerset, in the Peerage of Great Britain, which gave him an automatic seat in the British House of Lords. (The second Earl&#x27;s seventh son (second son from his second marriage), Spencer Perceval, served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1809, but was assassinated by John Bellingham in the lobby of the House of Commons in 1812).

Lord Egmont was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Earl, who sat as a member of parliament for Bridgwater. His grandson, the fifth Earl, briefly represented East Looe in the House of Commons. He was succeeded by his cousin, the sixth Earl, who had already succeeded his father as third Baron Arden (see below). He was Member of Parliament for West Surrey. On his death, the titles passed to his nephew, the seventh Earl. He was the son of Charles George Perceval, fourth son of the second Baron Arden. He represented Midhurst in Parliament as a Conservative. He was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the eighth Earl. He was the grandson of Arthur Philip Perceval, sixth son of the second Baron Arden. On the death in 1929 of his younger brother, the ninth Earl, this line of the family also failed and the titles became dormant.

They were claimed by the late Earl&#x27;s third cousin Frederick Joseph Trevelyan Perceval, who lived in Canada. He was the grandson of Frederick James Perceval, second son of Prime Minister Spencer Perceval, seventh son of the second Earl. He died in 1932 before he had established his claim. However, in 1939 the House of Lords allowed the claim of his only son Frederick George Moore Perceval, who became the eleventh Earl (his father having posthumously been deemed the tenth Earl). The eleventh Earl moved back to Alberta, Canada, and became a farmer. At his death in 2001, the eleventh Earl was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest and sole surviving son Thomas Frederick Gerald Perceval.

The twelfth Earl never married, and upon his death on 6 November 2011 the earldom and all of its subsidiary titles became extinct.

The title of Baroness Arden, of Lohort Castle in the County of Cork, was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1770 for Catherine Perceval, Countess of Egmont, second wife of the second Earl of Egmont. She was the daughter of Charles Compton, younger son of George Compton, 4th Earl of Northampton. Lady Arden was succeeded by her eldest son, the second Baron. He represented Launceston, Warwick and Totnes in Parliament and served as Master of the Mint from 1801 to 1802. In the latter year he was created Baron Arden, of Arden in the County of Warwick, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Baron, who in 1841 succeeded his cousin as sixth Earl of Egmont.

Mount Taranaki/Egmont in New Zealand was named after the second Earl of Egmont by James Cook.

<text>Run Lola Run (, ) is a 1998 German experimental thriller film written and directed by Tom Tykwer. The story follows a woman named Lola (Franka Potente) who needs to obtain 100,000 Deutsche Mark in twenty minutes to save the life of her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu).

&quot;Run Lola Run&quot; screened at the Venice Film Festival, where it competed for the Golden Lion. Following its release, the film received critical acclaim and several accolades, including the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival, Best Film at the Seattle International Film Festival, and seven awards at the German Film Awards. It was also selected as the German entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 71st Academy Awards, though it was not ultimately nominated.

==Plot==

Manni, a bagman responsible for delivering 100,000 Deutsche Mark, frantically calls his girlfriend Lola. Manni says that he was riding the U-Bahn to drop off the money and fled upon seeing ticket inspectors, before realizing that he had left the money bag behind; he saw a homeless man examining it as the train pulled away. Manni&#x27;s boss Ronnie will kill him in 20 minutes unless he has the money, so he is preparing to rob a nearby supermarket to replace the funds. Lola implores Manni to wait for her and decides to ask her father, a bank manager, for help.

Lola hangs up and runs down the staircase of her apartment building past a man with a dog. At the bank, her father is conversing with his mistress, who discloses her pregnancy. When Lola arrives, her conversation with her father turns into an argument. He tells her that he is leaving her mother and that Lola is not his biological daughter. Lola runs to meet Manni but arrives too late and sees him entering the supermarket with a gun. She helps him rob 100,000 marks but on leaving, they find the place surrounded by police. Surrendering, Manni throws the money bag into the air, which startles a police officer who accidentally shoots Lola dead.

Events restart from the moment Lola leaves the house. This time, the man with the dog deliberately trips her, and she runs with a limp and arrives late to the bank, allowing her father&#x27;s mistress to add that he is not the father of her unborn child. A furious Lola overhears the conversation, grabs a security guard&#x27;s gun, holds her father hostage and robs the bank of 100,000 marks. When police mistake her for a bystander, she is able to leave and meet with Manni in time and stop him from robbing a supermarket, but a speeding ambulance that Lola had distracted moments earlier fatally runs him over.

Events begin again. Lola leaps over the man and his dog, arriving at the bank earlier but not triggering an auto accident as she did the first two times. Consequently, her father&#x27;s customer arrives before her and leaves with her father. Lola now wanders aimlessly before entering a casino, where she hands over all her cash and plays roulette with a 100-mark chip. She bets it on the number 20, which wins. Roulette pays 35 to 1, so she wins 3,500 more marks, which she immediately adds to her original chip on 20. She now shrilly screams, and 20 comes up again. She leaves with a bag containing 129,600 marks and runs to Manni&#x27;s rendezvous. Manni spots the homeless man from the subway passing by on a bicycle with the money bag. Manni steals back the bag at gunpoint, exchanging his gun. A dishevelled and perspiring Lola arrives to witness Manni handing off the money to Ronnie. As the pair walk along, Manni casually asks Lola about her bag.

==Cast==
==Themes==
The film touches on themes such as free will vs. determinism, the role of chance in people&#x27;s destiny, and obscure cause-effect relationships. Through brief flash-forward sequences of still images, Lola&#x27;s fleeting interactions with bystanders are revealed to have surprising and drastic effects on their future lives, serving as concise illustrations of chaos theory&#x27;s butterfly effect, in which minor, seemingly inconsequential variations in any interaction can blossom into much broader results than is often recognized. The film&#x27;s exploration of the relationship between chance and conscious intention comes to the foreground in the casino scene, where Lola appears to defy the laws of chance through sheer force of will, improbably making the roulette ball land on her winning number with the help of a glass-shattering scream.

The thematic exploration of free will vs. determinism is made clear from the start. In the film&#x27;s brief prologue, an unseen narrator asks a series of rhetorical questions that prime the audience to view the film through a metaphysical lens touching on traditional philosophical questions involving determinism vs. philosophic libertarianism as well as epistemology. The theme is reinforced through the repeated appearance of a blind woman who briefly interacts with Manni in each alternative reality, and seems to have supernatural understandings of both the present and potential futures in those realities. The film ultimately seems to favor a compatibilist philosophical view to the free will question as evidenced by the casino scene and by the final telephone booth scene in which the blind woman redirects Manni&#x27;s attention to a passerby, which enables him to make an important choice near the film&#x27;s climax.

Several moments in the film allude to a supernatural awareness of the characters. For example, in the first reality, Manni shows a nervous Lola how to use a gun by removing the safety, while in the second timeline she removes the safety as though she remembers what to do. This suggests that she might have the memory of the events depicted in the previous timeline. Also, the bank&#x27;s guard says to Lola &quot;you finally came&quot; in the third timeline, as if he remembered Lola&#x27;s appearances in the previous two.

The theme of desire is expressed through the film as a driving force for Lola&#x27;s actions. In Ingebord Majer O&#x27;Sickey&#x27;s essay &quot;Whatever Lola Wants, Lola Gets (Or Does She?): Time and Desire in Tom Tykwer&#x27;s Run Lola Run&quot; she argues that &quot;what Lola really wants is to get into time sync with Manni in sexual terms&quot;. The conflict in the plot is driven by the initial phone conversation following Lola being late, leading to their timing to be out of sync. After the end of the first &quot;episode&quot;, the bedside questioning by Lola reveals her dissatisfaction with the relationship, leading Manni to ask &quot;Do you want to leave me?&quot;. O&#x27;Sickey makes the argument that each repeated return to the day is driven by Lola&#x27;s continual attempt to adjust Manni&#x27;s timing. The entirety of the film portrays Lola as &quot;postmodern heroine who could leap over traditional time-constraints&quot; giving the expectation that she ultimately would get what she wants. By the third arrival in the film, O&#x27;Sickey argues that &quot;Lola not only loses her super heroine status, but her desire to desire&quot;. She claims the ending portrays &quot;the tradition of classical Hollywood cinema&#x27;s economy of desire&quot;. With Manni having reacquired the money, Lola&#x27;s desire to be &quot;in sync&quot; disappears as she watches Manni&#x27;s &quot;metamorphosis from a bungling and fairly ineffective lover to a man in control of the situation&quot;. O&#x27;Sickey makes the claim that this deflates Lola&#x27;s heroine status in the final act.

==Production==
===Soundtrack===
The soundtrack, by Tykwer, Johnny Klimek, and Reinhold Heil, includes numerous musical quotations of the sustained string chords of &quot;The Unanswered Question&quot;, an early 20th-century chamber ensemble work by American composer Charles Ives. In the original work, the chords are meant to represent &quot;the Silences of the Druids—who Know, See and Hear Nothing&quot;.

The techno soundtrack established &quot;dialectical relation&quot; between motifs of the movie: &quot;Rhythm&quot;, &quot;Repetition&quot;, and &quot;Interval&quot; among various spatio-temporal logics. This produces unification of contradictions like &quot;Time and Space&quot; or &quot;The cyclical and the linear&quot;.

===Filming locations===

&quot;Run Lola Run&quot; was filmed in and around Berlin, Germany.

==Reception==
=== Critical reception ===
In contrasting reviews at the time of the film&#x27;s release, &quot;Film Threat&quot;″s Chris Gore said of the film, &quot;[It] delivers everything great foreign films should—action, sex, compelling characters, clever filmmaking, it&#x27;s unpretentious (a requirement for me) and it has a story you can follow without having to read those annoying subtitles. I can&#x27;t rave about this film enough—this is passionate filmmaking at its best. One of the best foreign films, heck, one of the best films I have seen&quot;, while Jonathan Rosenbaum of &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; stated, &quot;About as entertaining as a no-brainer can be—a lot more fun, for my money, than a cornball theme-park ride like &quot;Speed&quot;, and every bit as fast moving. But don&#x27;t expect much of an aftertaste.&quot;

, the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 94% of critics gave the film positive reviews based on 93 reviews, with an average rating of 7.70/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;More fun than a barrel of Jean-Paul Sartre, pic&#x27;s energy riffs on an engaging love story and really human performances while offering a series of what-ifs and a blood-stirring soundtrack.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 77 out of 100, based on 29 reviews, stating the film as having &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;.

===Box office===
The film was the highest-grossing German film released in 1998 with a gross of $13.8 million. It grossed $8.1 million in the United States and Canada and $23.7 million worldwide.

=== Accolades ===
The film was nominated for dozens of awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. It won several, including the Audience Award at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival, Best Film at the Seattle International Film Festival, and seven separate awards at the German Film Awards. &quot;Lola Rennt&quot; was ranked number 86 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. It was also nominated for the Golden Lion at the 55th Venice International Film Festival, and a European Film Award in 1998.

&quot;Run Lola Run&quot; was selected as the German entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 71st Academy Awards, but not ultimately nominated.

==Home media==
The film was released on DVD on 21 December 1999 and on Blu-ray on 19 February 2008.

==Influence==

=== Allusions to earlier films ===
The film has drawn numerous comparisons to Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski&#x27;s &quot;Blind Chance&quot; (1982), which also features three scenarios, the outcome of which depends on split-second timing. After Kieślowski&#x27;s death, Tykwer went on to direct his planned next film, &quot;Heaven&quot;.

&quot;Run Lola Run&quot; features two allusions to Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Like that film, it features recurring images of spirals, such as the Spirale bar behind Manni&#x27;s phone box, the spiral staircase Lola runs down, and the spirals on the bedsheet. In addition, the painting on the back wall of the casino of a woman&#x27;s head seen from behind is based on a shot in &quot;Vertigo&quot;: Tykwer disliked the empty space on the wall behind the roulette table and commissioned production designer Alexander Manasse to paint a picture of Kim Novak as she appeared in &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Manasse could not remember what she looked like in the film; therefore, he decided to paint the famous shot of the back of her head. The painting took fifteen minutes to complete. The bed sheets in the red scenes also feature spiral designs which add to the allusion.

The Lola character is often compared to the Lara Croft character of the 1996 video game Tomb Raider.

Coincidentally, the film &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; (also released in 1998) follows two timelines which diverge based on a seemingly minor decision: one in which the protagonist hesitates for a fellow pedestrian, and the delay causes her to miss a subway train; and another where she sidesteps the pedestrian and catches the train.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Run Lola Run&quot; has had a significant influence either narratively or aesthetically on multiple films, television shows, and other mediums. 

Nintendo producer Eiji Aonuma cited the film as a major influence while working on the story for &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask,&quot; and was inspired by the time limit concept seen on the film. Majora&#x27;s Mask was released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64 to universal acclaim from critics, and is widely considered one of the best video games ever made.

=== Music Videos ===
The music video for &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; by Bon Jovi, released in 2000, was inspired by the film. The music video for &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; by Yellowcard is also seen by some to have been inspired by the film, as is the opening scene of &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&quot; episode &quot;Beneath You&quot;, where a pink-haired girl is seen running through a German street to techno music reminiscent of the movie.

The music video for &quot;Happy Homemaker&quot; by Canadian singer Melanie Doane is also an homage to the film.

The music video for &quot;Walk Me to the Bridge&quot; (2014) by Manic Street Preachers directly references the movie.

=== Television ===
Stan Rogow, the executive producer of the Disney Channel original teen comedy &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;, stated the visual design of the show was inspired by &quot;Run Lola Run&quot;, specifically mentioning Lizzie&#x27;s animated persona.

The movie has been referenced in various animated series, including the 2001 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Trilogy of Error&quot;, the 2011 &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; episode &quot;Run, Candace, Run&quot;, and a 2021 &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; segment of &quot;Animaniacs&quot; called &quot;Run Pinky Run&quot;.

The series &quot;SMILF&quot; includes a 2017 episode (&quot;Run, Bridgette, Run or Forty-Eight Burnt Cupcakes &amp; Graveyard Rum&quot;) which references the film. 

=== Films ===
Two Hindi language remakes of the film was release, &quot;Ek Din 24 Ghante&quot; in 2003, and &quot;Looop Lapeta&quot; in 2022.

For its 25th anniversary in 2024, the film was re-released in 4k in select United States theaters.

<doc id="462766" wikidata="Q322999" url="?curid=462766" title="Chris Roberts (video game developer)">
<text>Chris Roberts (born May 27, 1968) is a British-American video game designer, programmer, film producer and film director. He created the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; series while at Origin Systems and has been working on the crowdfunded space simulator &quot;Star Citizen&quot; since 2010.

== Early life ==
Roberts was born in Redwood City, California to a British father and an American mother, and grew up in Manchester, England. He attended Parrs Wood High School, the same school as computer music composer Martin Galway. As a teenager, he created several video games for the BBC Micro, including &quot;Stryker&#x27;s Run&quot;, &quot;Wizadore&quot;, and &quot;King Kong&quot;.

== Career ==

=== Origin ===
Roberts returned to the United States in 1986 to visit his parents, who had settled in Austin, Texas. He found a job at Origin Systems, where he created &quot;Times of Lore&quot;, published in 1988. The game&#x27;s interface had a strong influence on other Origin products such as the popular &quot;Ultima&quot; series. A similar game system was used in Roberts&#x27;s next release for Origin, &quot;Bad Blood&quot; (1990).

&quot;Wing Commander&quot; was published later in 1990 and was highly acclaimed. &quot;Wing Commander&quot; (and the franchise it spawned) soon became Origin&#x27;s most successful product. Roberts wasn&#x27;t as heavily involved in the sequel &quot;Wing Commander II&quot;, which he only produced. He instead concentrated on &quot;Strike Commander&quot;. First shown to the public at Summer CES 1991, the project suffered from numerous delays and was not released until 1993. He returned to &quot;Wing Commander&quot; soon after, devising the original concept for the spin-off &quot;Wing Commander: Privateer&quot; (which his brother, Erin Roberts, produced) and being more deeply involved in &quot;Wing Commander III&quot; and &quot;Wing Commander IV&quot;. For these sequels, Roberts directed the live-action cinematic scenes. Roberts&#x27;s major role in developing the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; games led &quot;Next Generation&quot; to name him one of their &quot;75 Most Important People in the Games Industry of 1995&quot;.

Following the traditions of Origin Systems, Chris Roberts&#x27;s residence at the outskirts of Austin, Texas was named &quot;Commander&#x27;s Ranch&quot;, a reference to the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; series.

=== Digital Anvil ===
Roberts left Origin in 1996 and founded Digital Anvil with Tony Zurovec and his brother Erin Roberts. He cited disillusionment with working with large development teams and Origin parent company Electronic Arts&#x27; unwillingness to give substantial funding to games that weren&#x27;t sequels. The fledgling studio set up shop in Austin and for several years worked quietly, inking a publishing deal with Microsoft in 1997.

Roberts had stated that he desired to produce films as well as games with Digital Anvil. The 1999 feature film release of &quot;Wing Commander&quot; directed by Roberts himself, starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and featuring visual effects from Digital Anvil, failed to attract either critical praise or financial success.

Digital Anvil&#x27;s first finished game was &quot;Starlancer&quot;, released to a generally favorable critical reception in 2000. Developed jointly between Warthog and Digital Anvil, the game was produced by the Roberts brothers, and Eric Peterson. The company was acquired by Microsoft soon after, who sold two of Digital Anvil&#x27;s projects, &quot;&quot; led by Eric Peterson, and &quot;Loose Cannon&quot; led by Tony Zurovec to Ubisoft. Roberts left the company after the acquisition, abandoning the director position of his ambitious project &quot;Freelancer&quot;, although he remained with the game in a consulting role for a while. The game was commonly regarded as vaporware due to its promised release date of 2001; however, it was eventually released in 2003 with a markedly different feature set than the initial plans.

=== Point of No Return Entertainment/Ascendant Pictures ===
After leaving Digital Anvil, Roberts founded Point of No Return Entertainment, planning to produce films, television and games. However, no projects materialized from Point of No Return. Roberts founded Ascendant Pictures in 2002 and served as a producer for a number of Hollywood productions including &quot;Edison&quot;, &quot;Timber Falls&quot;, &quot;Outlander&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Caddy?&quot;, &quot;The Big White&quot;, &quot;Ask the Dust&quot;, &quot;Lucky Number Slevin&quot; and &quot;Lord of War&quot;, which were almost entirely financed by a loophole in the German tax laws that was finally closed in 2006. Roberts&#x27; activities as a film producer ended with the depletion of the funds raised by this controversial financing scheme. In 2005, actor Kevin Costner sued Ascendant Pictures for breach of contract on an unreleased film. The company was acquired by Bigfoot Entertainment in 2010.

=== Cloud Imperium Games ===
In 2011, Chris Roberts founded Cloud Imperium Games with his wife Sandi Roberts, as well as business partner and long-time international media attorney Ortwin Freyermuth, to work on a new game. In October 2012, Cloud Imperium Games launched a crowdfunding campaign on their website to produce a space simulation game, &quot;Star Citizen&quot;, and later added a Kickstarter campaign in conjunction. By November 2012, they had earned US$6,238,563, surpassing all stretch goals set for the campaigns, and breaking video game industry crowdfunding records. Chris Roberts had stated that if at least $23 million could be raised over the course of the crowdfunding campaign, no outside investors&#x27; or developers&#x27; funding would be required. This goal was reached October 18, 2013.

As of June 11, 2024, Cloud Imperium Games has raised over US$700 million in crowdfunding and over $63.25 million in external investments. Cloud Imperium Games&#x27; other title in development, &quot;Squadron 42&quot;, a single-player campaign set in the &quot;Star Citizen&quot; universe, is still in development with an estimated release date of 2026, having been feature-complete and in the polish phase since 2024

<text>The Williams Tower (originally named the Transco Tower) is a 64-story, class A postmodern office tower located in the Uptown District of Houston, Texas. The building was designed by New York–based John Burgee Architects with Philip Johnson in association with Houston-based Morris-Aubry Architects (now known as Morris Architects). Construction began in August 1981, and the building was opened in 1983. The tower is among Houston&#x27;s most visible buildings as the 4th-tallest in Texas, and the 51st-tallest in the United States. The Williams Tower is the tallest building in Houston outside of Downtown Houston, and is the tallest skyscraper in the United States outside of a city&#x27;s central business district. It has been referred to as the &quot;Empire State Building of the south&quot;.

==History==
Real estate developer Gerald D. Hines hired New York–based John Burgee Architects with Philip Johnson to design the building, in association with Houston-based Morris-Aubry Architects (now known as Morris Architects).

Construction was completed in 1983, with an open house held in April.

The building was named the Transco Tower after its first major tenant, Transco Energy Co. Transco Energy Co. merged with the Williams Companies in 1995 and in 1999 the name of the building was changed to the Williams Tower.

In December 2002, Ryan John Hartley climbed the tower and jumped from about halfway up, resulting in his death, which was ruled a suicide.

In 2008, Hines REIT Properties LP, an affiliate of Hines Real Estate Investment Trust Inc., purchased the Williams Tower for $271.5 million from Transco Tower Ltd., a partnership consisting of Kuwaiti investors represented by Atlanta-based Fosterlane Management Corp. The building was offered along with a parking garage, a tract across the street from the Williams Tower, and a 48% stake in the Williams Waterwall (now named the Gerald D. Hines Waterwall Park) and the surrounding park; prior to this transaction Hines had already owned the other 52% of the waterwall.

On the morning of September 13, 2008, during Hurricane Ike, the top of the tower was damaged near the rotating beacon and many windows were blown out. The skyscraper suffered over $3.5 million in wind damages. Twelve of the 49 elevators were damaged, most by water damage due to roof failures and others due to extreme building sway.

Hines Real Estate Investment Trust Inc. put the Williams Tower up for sale in August 2012, selling it to Invesco Ltd. subsidiary Invesco Advisers Inc. for $412 million in March 2013.

==Major tenants==
The building was originally named for its major tenant, Transco Energy corporation, now part of the Williams Companies, the tower&#x27;s current namesake. Other major tenants include Quanta Services, and the Consulate General of Denmark. The tower also served as the headquarters for the Hines companies until mid-2022.
==Significance==

At 64 stories and above the ground level, the Williams Tower is the tallest building in Houston outside of Downtown Houston. When it was constructed in 1983, it was also the world&#x27;s tallest skyscraper outside of a city&#x27;s central business district.

The building was built to function as two separate towers stacked directly on top of one another, one comprising the first forty floors and the other the forty-first to sixty-fourth. The building has separate banks of elevators and lobbies for each of the two building sections. A majority of the bottom 40 floors are occupied by Williams. The remainder of the building is occupied by a variety of tenants.

Williams Tower was named &quot;Skyscraper of the Century&quot; in the December 1999 issue of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; magazine. Paul Gapp of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said that the building became an &quot;instant classic&quot; when it opened. Paul Goldberger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the tower gave Post Oak Boulevard &quot;a center, an anchor, which most out-towns lack&quot;.

==Features==
There are six elevators that take tenants to the 51st floor, where they can transfer to other elevators to get to the 49th through 64th floor of the building. There is no public observation deck.

During the nighttime hours, the building is defined by a 7,000 watt beacon that sweeps across the sky and can be seen up to 40 miles (65 km) away on a clear night. Topped by such a beacon, the tower hearkens back to the Palmolive Building in Chicago, Illinois. The building, along with its beacon, is a Houston landmark that identifies the Uptown Houston district.

The building is connected to a 10 level, 3,208 car parking garage by a sky bridge. The bridge also connects the building to retail outlets, like The Galleria, and two Federal Aviation Administration-licensed helipads.

In a grass field adjacent to the Williams Tower is the Gerald D. Hines Waterwall Park. Formerly privately owned in common with the tower, the waterwall and park has been owned by the Uptown Houston Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone, a non-profit local government corporation since 2008.

The &quot;Houston Business Journal&quot; said that the tower was &quot;designed to be energy efficient&quot;. The building received the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s Energy Star label for each year since 2000 in which the building was eligible to receive the award. As of 2009, the building managers are seeking to gain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification from the United States Green Building Council.

The top four angles of the building form cat-like shapes with tails that run down all the way to street level.

<doc id="462774" wikidata="Q5326272" url="?curid=462774" title="Earl of Enniskillen">
<text>Earl of Enniskillen is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1789 for William Cole, 1st Viscount Enniskillen. He had already been created Viscount Enniskillen in the Peerage of Ireland in 1776 and had inherited the title Baron Mountflorence, of Florence Court in the County of Fermanagh, which had been created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1760 for his father John Cole, who had earlier represented Enniskillen in the Irish House of Commons. The family are descended from the Ulster planter, Sir William Cole.

Lord Enniskillen was succeeded by his son, the second earl. He represented Fermanagh in the British House of Commons, served as Lord Lieutenant of County Fermanagh and sat as an Irish representative peer in the House of Lords at Westminster between 1804–40. In 1815 he was created Baron Grinstead, of Grinstead in the County of Wiltshire, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him and the later earls an automatic seat in the House of Lords.

His son, the third earl, was a palaeontologist and also sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Fermanagh. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth earl, who represented Enniskillen in Parliament as a Conservative. His son, the fifth earl, was Lord Lieutenant of Fermanagh.

==The title since 1963==

The 5th Earl was succeeded by his nephew, Captain David Lowry Cole, M.B.E., M.L.C., who became the 6th Earl. He was the son of The Hon. Galbraith Lowry Egerton Cole, third son of the 4th Earl. David was also a nephew of The Hon. Berkeley Cole and a nephew-in-law to The 3rd Baron Delamere, as well as being a first-cousin of The 4th Baron Delamere. The Cholmondeley family, Barons Delamere, owned (and, in 2012, still own) the vast Soysambu Ranch in Kenya. David Enniskillen (as he was usually known to his family and friends) had been born and raised in the Colony of Kenya.

He attended Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, and then served with the Irish Guards during the Second World War, rising to the British Army rank of Captain. Following the war, the young Capt. D.L. Cole returned to Kenya, serving as a Provisional Commandant in the Kenya Police Reserve (the K.P.R.), 1953–55. He was appointed a M.B.E. for his services to the British Crown during the Mau Mau Uprising.

Capt. D.L. Cole became very involved in colonial politics in Kenya in the late 1950s, serving as a Member of the Legislative Council (M.L.C.) in the final Legislative Council of Kenya, 1961–1963. He also took part in the conferences at Lancaster House leading up to Kenya&#x27;s independence, which was achieved within the Commonwealth in December 1963. On 19 February 1963, while still serving as an M.L.C., a few months before Kenyan independence, Capt. Cole succeeded as The 6th Earl of Enniskillen. Shortly after succeeding to the Peerage, the new Lord Enniskillen returned to Northern Ireland. He and his American second wife, Nancy, a former junior diplomat with the United States Foreign Service, lived at Florence Court (newly restored by the National Trust) in southwest County Fermanagh from 1963–72, when they relocated to Kinloch House, , Amulree, Perthshire, Scotland.

David Enniskillen served as a captain in the Ulster Defence Regiment (the U.D.R.), 1971–1973, during the very early years of The Troubles in Northern Ireland. He also served as Deputy Lieutenant of County Fermanagh, 1963–78. He lived at Kinloch House until his death in 1989, when he was buried in the grounds of Killesher Parish Church, the Church of Ireland neo-Gothic family church near the village of Florencecourt in south-west County Fermanagh. Nancy, Dowager Countess of Enniskillen (née Nancy MacLennan), formerly of Bridgeport, Connecticut, was also buried at Killesher Parish Church in 1998.

The 6th Lord Enniskillen had only two children, both by his first wife, Sonia Mary Syers, whom he married on 31 July 1940. They were divorced early in 1955. The two children were Andrew Cole (born 28 April 1942) and Linda Mar Cole (born 26 March 1944). From 1963-89, Andrew held the courtesy title Viscount Cole. Since the death of his father in 1989, Andrew has been The 7th Earl of Enniskillen (usually known to his family and friends as Andrew Enniskillen). Since February 1963, Linda has been known as Lady Linda Mar Cole. She married Richard Muir (possibly &#x27;Sir&#x27; Richard), the presumed 4th Bt., in August 1975. Thus she is also known as Lady Linda Muir. The 7th Lord Enniskillen lives on his 40,000 acre estate near Lake Naivasha in the former &#x27;White Highlands&#x27; in southern Kenya.

The ancestral seat, certainly from the late 1750s, of the Cole family was Florence Court in south-west County Fermanagh. The house has been in the care of the National Trust since 1953. The last Earl to live in the country house was David, 6th Earl of Enniskillen (1918–1989), who left in 1972. Michael Cole, ancestor of the Earls of Enniskillen, was the brother of Sir John Cole, 1st Baronet (see Baron Ranelagh).

<doc id="462777" wikidata="Q1242320" url="?curid=462777" title="Don't Mess with Texas">
<text>&quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with Texas&quot; is a slogan for a campaign aimed at reducing littering on Texas roadways by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with Texas&quot; is prominently shown on road signs on major highways, television, radio and in print advertisements. The campaign is credited with reducing litter on Texas highways roughly 72% between 1987 and 1990. The campaign&#x27;s target market was 18- to 35-year-old males, which was statistically shown to be the most likely to litter. While the slogan was not originally intended to become a statewide cultural phenomenon, it eventually did become one.

Beyond its immediate role in reducing litter, the slogan has been popularly appropriated by Texans. The phrase has become &quot;an identity statement, a declaration of Texas swagger&quot; and Texas pride. Though the origin of the slogan is not well known outside of Texas, it appears on countless items of tourist souvenirs. Since the phrase is a federally registered trademark, the department has tried at times to enforce its trademark rights with cease and desist letters, but has had very limited success. The slogan is the title of the book, &quot;Don’t Mess With Texas: The Story Behind the Legend&quot;.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with Texas&quot; has been awarded a plaque on the Madison Avenue Walk of Fame and a place in the Advertising Hall of Fame, a distinction given to only two slogans annually.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with Texas&quot; is also the official motto of the &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarine USS &quot;Texas&quot;.

In 2011 the result of a public vote for the best &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with Texas&quot; ad over the last 25 years was revealed, the winner was one created by the Commemorative Air Force (then called the Confederate Air Force). The ad involved the CAF&#x27;s Boeing B-17 &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; pursuing and retaliating against a truck from which trash was thrown.

== History ==

In 1985 the TxDOT asked Mike Blair and Tim McClure of GSD&amp;M to create a slogan for an anti-littering campaign. At the time the state of Texas spent about $20 million annually to clean litter from highways. McClure said that &quot;bubbas in pickup trucks&quot; who regularly littered beer cans and other items out of vehicle windows and ordinary Texans who believed that littering was a &quot;God-given right&quot; were targets of the advertising campaign. McClure said that he created the slogan when he saw garbage while walking near his house. Emanuella Grinberg of &quot;CNN&quot; said that McClure had &quot;an eleventh hour &#x27;aha&#x27; moment&quot; when, after looking at the trash, he recalled his mother telling him that his room was messy. &quot;McClure said &#x27;It occurred to me that the only time I&#x27;d heard the word litter was in reference to dogs. Mess seemed like it would resonate better.&#x27;&quot; McClure&#x27;s slogan is believed to be the first written use of &quot;Don&#x27;t mess with Texas&quot;, although there are earlier uses of &quot;Don&#x27;t mess with...&quot; such as the 1966 Marvelette&#x27;s song &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with Bill&quot;.

The creators initially had difficulty convincing TxDOT to adopt the slogan. The creators said that the administrators were &quot;buzz-cutted, conservative kind of characters.&quot; The creators joked that the board members&#x27; average age was 107. McClure recalled that &quot;The crowd was sprinkled with &#x27;Keep America Beautiful&#x27; and &#x27;Keep Texas Beautiful&#x27; folks, and our audience is 18-to-24 young males.&quot; McClure added that &quot;The &#x27;Keep Texas Beautiful&#x27; lady said, &#x27;Can we at least say please?&#x27; I said, &#x27;No ma&#x27;am, you cannot use the line if you put please in front of it.&#x27; If not for the vision of Don Clark, the then Director of Travel and Information Division of the Texas Highway Department, the slogan would have never been used. Clark went ahead with the slogan without the support of the TxDOT administrators. After the first televised ad with Stevie Ray Vaughan aired, Clark jokes that he went to work the next day and was unsure if he would be fired. TxDOT decided to ask the public for comment and there was a resounding positive result.&quot;

The campaign began in 1985 with a series of bumper stickers. In 1986 the slogan premiered its first television advertisement, featuring Stevie Ray Vaughan, at the 50th Annual Cotton Bowl Classic on January 1, 1986, singing the &quot;Eyes of Texas&quot; with the line &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with Texas&quot; added at the end of the song. Since then, numerous musicians, athletes, celebrities and other famous Texans have appeared in &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with Texas&quot; radio and television public service announcements, including:
* Lance Armstrong
*Asleep at the Wheel
* Erykah Badu
* Marcia Ball
*Joe &quot;King&quot; Carrasco
*Johnny Dee and the Rocket 88&#x27;s
*Joe Ely
*The Fabulous Thunderbirds
*George Foreman
*Tish Hinojosa
* Los Lonely Boys
* Jennifer Love Hewitt
*Lyle Lovett
*Billy Mays
*Matthew McConaughey
*Warren Moon
*Willie Nelson
* Slim Thug
*Andy Pettitte
*LeAnn Rimes
* Shamu &amp; the Texas Tuxedos
*Stevie Ray Vaughan
* Jerry Jeff Walker
*George Strait
* Owen Wilson
* Chuck Norris
* Papi Chulo
* Whitney K Lane
* Morgan Fairchild
* Chamillionaire
* Black Pumas
* Joe Jonas
* Ethan Hawke
In a 12-year period with the agency GSD&amp;M, over 26 television spots appeared.

Due to the budget cuts of the Great Recession, TxDOT has expanded the use of the licence to sell &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess With Texas&quot; related souvenirs in &quot;state run rest areas, and travel information centers&quot; in order to fill in its budget gaps. Until 2012, the organization was forbidden to do so due to federal regulations.

After learning that 96% of Texans had heard the phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t mess with Texas&quot; but only 61% of Texans knew the slogan meant don&#x27;t litter, TxDOT began brainstorming new campaign ideas to re-emphasize the original meaning of the campaign. In 2009, TxDOT launched a new campaign including new TV and radio featuring George Strait telling Texans that &quot;Don&#x27;t mess with Texas means don&#x27;t litter&quot;. This slogan is still used in all of the campaigns and radio ads.

As of 2023, the San Antonio, Texas-based advertising agency, GDC Marketing &amp; Ideation manages the &quot;Don&#x27;t mess with Texas&quot; brand.

==Unauthorized use of the trademark==
Since 2000, TxDOT has contacted over 100 companies and organizations with cease and desist letters regarding the unauthorized use of the trademark phrase. State officials claim that protecting the trademark helps the state preserve the slogan&#x27;s anti-littering message.
* A Texas-based company in Alabama used the slogan for a billboard campaign in February 2010.
* The University of Texas at Austin agreed to stop selling T-shirts with the slogan after being contacted by the Texas Department of Transportation.
* The department attempted to block the Texas Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League from the sale of &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess With Texas Women&quot; T-shirts.
*The author Christie Craig published a romance novel originally titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with Texas&quot;. After legal actions, the title was changed to &quot;Only in Texas&quot;.
* Malacca State Government in Malaysia used the slogan with the same design and same phrase but changed it to &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess With Melaka&quot; in 2014, but its Chief Minister claimed the copycat claim was baseless.

* On July 19, 1986, four members of the New York Mets baseball club, in Houston for a series versus the Astros, were arrested at a Houston nightclub. Homemade signs held up in the Astrodome by fans at the following night&#x27;s game read &quot;Don&#x27;t Mets With Texas.&quot;

Thomas was quoted as saying, &quot;You know there&#x27;s a saying that goes, &#x27;Don&#x27;t mess with Texas. Well DART, don&#x27;t mess with BART.&quot;
* In the Stephen King novel &quot;11/22/63&quot;, the time-travelling main character, Jake Epping, encounters a shop in a North Dallas neighborhood selling Texas state flags emblazoned with &quot;DON&#x27;T MESS WITH TEXAS&quot; in September 1960, twenty years before McClure created the slogan. McClure sent a copy of his book to King&#x27;s agent to educate him about the error, but he has said that he is happy to have people think the slogan is much older than it really is. McClure has no desire to see a correction made to the novel regarding this anachronism.

<text>The Lowland Clearances were one of the results of the Scottish Agricultural Revolution, which changed the traditional system of agriculture which had existed in Lowland Scotland in the seventeenth century. Thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from the southern counties (Lowlands) of Scotland migrated from farms and small holdings they had occupied to the new industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh and northern England or abroad, or remaining upon land though adapting to the Scottish Agricultural Revolution.

==History==

As farmland became more commercialised in Scotland during the 18th century, land was often rented through auctions. This led to an inflation of rents that priced many tenants out of the market. Furthermore, changes in agricultural practice meant the replacement of part-time labourer or subtenants (known as cottars, cottagers, or bondsmen) with full-time agricultural labourers who lived either on the main farm or in rented accommodation in growing or newly founded villages. This led many contemporary writers and modern historians to associate the Agricultural Revolution with the disappearance of cottars and their way of life from many parts of the southern Scotland.

Many small settlements were torn down, their occupants forced either to the new purpose-built villages built by the landowners such as John Cockburn of Ormiston to house the displaced cottars on the outskirts of the new ranch-style farms, or to the new industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh or northern England. In other areas, such as the southwest, landowners offered low rents and nearby employment to tenants they deemed to be respectable. Between 1760 and 1830, many tens of thousands of Lowland Scots emigrated mainly within Lowland Scotland, with some taking advantage of the many new opportunities offered in Canada to own and farm their own land. Most chose to remain, by choice, some out of an inability to secure transatlantic passage, or because of obligations in Scotland.

<doc id="462782" wikidata="Q233721" url="?curid=462782" title="Carla Bley">
<text>Carla Bley (born Lovella May Borg; May 11, 1936 – October 17, 2023) was an American jazz composer, pianist, organist, and bandleader. An important figure in the free jazz movement of the 1960s, she gained acclaim for her jazz opera &quot;Escalator over the Hill&quot; (released as a triple LP set), as well as a book of compositions that have been performed by many other artists, including Gary Burton, Jimmy Giuffre, George Russell, Art Farmer, Robert Wyatt, John Scofield, and her ex-husband Paul Bley. She was a pioneer in the development of independent artist-owned record labels, and recorded over two dozen albums between 1966 and 2019.

==Early life==
Bley was born in Oakland, California, in 1936, to Swedish parents. Her father, Emil Borg, a piano teacher and church choirmaster, encouraged her to sing and to learn to play the piano; her mother, Arline Anderson, died of a heart attack when Bley was eight years old. After giving up church to immerse herself in roller skating at the age of fourteen, she moved to New York City at seventeen and became a cigarette girl at Birdland, where she met jazz pianist Paul Bley, who encouraged her to start composing. She toured with him under the name Karen Borg before changing her name in 1957 to Carla Borg. She married Bley and took his name the same year, later divorcing. She kept the surname professionally thereafter.

==Career==
A number of musicians began to record Bley&#x27;s compositions: George Russell recorded &quot;Bent Eagle&quot; for his album &quot;Stratusphunk&quot; in 1960; Jimmy Giuffre recorded &quot;Ictus&quot; on his album &quot;Thesis&quot;; and Paul Bley&#x27;s &quot;Barrage&quot; consisted entirely of her compositions. Throughout her career, Bley thought of herself as a writer first, describing herself as 99 percent composer and one percent pianist.

In 1964, she was involved in organizing the Jazz Composers Guild, which brought together the most innovative musicians in New York at the time. She then had a personal and professional relationship with Michael Mantler, with whom she had a daughter, Karen Mantler, who also became a musician. Bley and Mantler were married from 1965 to 1991. With Mantler, she co-led the Jazz Composers&#x27; Orchestra and started the JCOA record label which issued a number of historic recordings by Clifford Thornton, Don Cherry, and Roswell Rudd, as well as her own magnum opus &quot;Escalator Over The Hill&quot; and Mantler&#x27;s &quot;The Jazz Composer&#x27;s Orchestra&quot; LPs. Bley and Mantler were pioneers in the development of independent artist-owned record labels, and also started WATT Records and the now defunct New Music Distribution Service, which specialized in small, independent labels that issued recordings of &quot;creative improvised music&quot;.

Bley arranged and composed music for bassist Charlie Haden&#x27;s Liberation Music Orchestra, and wrote &quot;A Genuine Tong Funeral&quot; for vibraphonist Gary Burton. Bley collaborated with a number of other artists, including Jack Bruce, Robert Wyatt, and Nick Mason, drummer for the rock group Pink Floyd. Mason&#x27;s solo debut album &quot;Nick Mason&#x27;s Fictitious Sports&quot; was written entirely by Bley, and features, alongside Mason on drums, many of her regular band musicians, leading Brian Olewnick of AllMusic to consider it a Carla Bley album in all but name.

Wolfgang Sandner summarized for Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that she was &quot;great as a stimulator, as a muse, catalyst, idea generator, as a sounding board and amplifier, also in refusing – virtuosity, fetishised technique, perfect craft, convention and false pathos&quot;.

==Later life and death==
Bley continued to record frequently with her own big band, which included Lew Soloff from Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, and with a number of smaller ensembles, notably the Lost Chords.
After Bley&#x27;s marriage to Mantler ended, she began a relationship with bassist Steve Swallow.

In 2005, she arranged the music for and performed on Charlie Haden&#x27;s latest Liberation Music Orchestra tour and recording, &quot;Not in Our Name&quot;.

Her final album, &quot;Life Goes On&quot;, was released in 2020.

In 2018, Bley was diagnosed with brain cancer, from which she died at home in Willow, New York, on October 17, 2023, at age 87.

== Awards ==
Bley was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1972 for music composition. In 2009, she received the German Jazz Trophy &quot;A Life for Jazz&quot;. Bley received the NEA Jazz Masters Award in 2015.

<text>The &quot;Maestrale&quot; class is a class of frigates of the Italian Navy. The class is composed of eight vessels, all of which were built by Fincantieri S.p.A., Riva Trigoso, except for &quot;Grecale&quot;, which was built by Fincantieri S.p.A. – Muggiano, La Spezia.

The &quot;Maestrale&quot;-class frigates were primarily designed for anti-submarine warfare (ASW), however the ships are highly flexible so they are also capable of anti-air and anti-surface operations. Ships of this class have been widely used in various international missions, either under NATO or UN flag, and during normal operations of the Italian Navy.

The first of these ships entered in service in early 1982. The rest of the fleet was launched over the next three years. The ships of the &quot;Maestrale&quot; class will be replaced by the &quot;Bergamini&quot; class.

==Design==
These ships were built with the experience and the technology already developed for the previous . The &quot;Maestrale&quot;s were quite bigger and heavier, so they were slower, but still capable of around . The ships have a large superstructure, with one large turret and only one funnel. There are two enclosed pyramid masts, one of which is quite low, the other much taller. The superstructure continues without interruption until the hangar, and is made, as usual, with light alloys.

The propulsion system is based on two gas-turbine GE-Avio LM-2500 and two diesel engines, in a combined diesel or gas configuration, that make use of diesel for cruising and turbines for high speed. The only problem with this configuration, which is highly economical, is to make the diesel engines powerful enough to achieve sufficient cruising speed without overloading them, or assist them with a continuous use (at low, uneconomical power) of the turbines. In this case, the solution, already developed for the &quot;Lupo&quot;-class ships, was successful. The ships have a maximum range of at .

===Armament===
The &quot;Maestrale&quot; class ships are armed with an array of systems. Mounted on the foredeck is an Oto Melara 127 mm/54 gun, capable of shooting 40 rounds per minute. Despite its large size, it was possible to fit it in the relatively small hull, since the &quot;Lupo&quot;-class ships were fitted with the same weapon. It has 66 shells on three ready-fire carousels. It also had low reaction times and high elevation, with a shells and range.

The ships also carry the Albatross missile system, with an octuple cell capable of firing Sea Sparrow or Aspide missiles. This modern weapon contains a monopulse guide and a powerful rocket-engine, and advanced flight controls. The ships carry a supply of 24 missiles, and the system is reloaded by a Riva-Calzoni Automatic Handling System, which is capable of loading up to four missiles at once, making virtually all the missiles in the magazine ready to be launched.

After the turret there are two CIWS DARDO, with two 40 mm/L70 Bofors guns. They have very rapid mechanical systems, and depots with over 700 shells, and can fire around 600 rounds per minute. The proximity fuses and the fire control systems help this unmanned turret to react quickly to incoming missiles.

Also on deck are four Otomat anti-ship missiles, capable of striking a target or more away, with a warhead. They are fitted over the hangar, where there are two AB-212 helicopters ASW multi-role machines.

Finally, there are four torpedo-launchers, two triple ILAS-3 (similar to Mk 32) tubes, with 12 torpedoes available (not known if they are shared also with helicopters), and the A.184, a wired torpedo with two launch tubes and six to eight torpedoes. This is the main weapon for ASW tasks, but it also be used as an anti-ship weapon, even though its propulsion system (electric) does not allow great speed and range. Compared to ASROC, this weapon has many advantages, and does not require a bulky launcher, but needs several minutes, even at , to reach , while ASROC can do this in much less time.

===Electronic warfare outfit===
These ships also have several electronic systems: one radar air and surface search RAN10S () is placed over the smaller tree, a radar of navigation and surface search SPN703 is fitted on the main tree, where a navigation radar is present as well, and finally, three radars: one RTN-10X for gun and Aspide control, and two smaller RTN-20X for the DARDO systems, all fitted in the forward superstructure, separated from the aft by the funnel and the heat dissipaters. As to submarine search, there is a VDS DE 1164 sonar, and DE1160B hull mounted. EW component is focused on Elettronica Spa MM/SLQ-746 () and two SCLAR rocket-launchers that are capable of launching chaff, flare, and HE rockets up to .

Several electronic and communication systems are fitted as well, and an Selex ES IPN20 command and control system is present to integrate all the tactical information and use the weapons on board.

==Comparison of &quot;Maestrale&quot; and &quot;Lupo&quot; classes==
The &quot;Lupo&quot; class entered in service in 1977. The &quot;Maestrale&quot; class is an upgraded version of its predecessor. &quot;Maestrale&quot; shares the same, extremely slim hull (with a length/width of 10:1) but this was enlarged to accommodate many more systems. The &quot;Lupo&quot;s are faster, and is equipped with eight OTOMAT. The &quot;Maestrale&quot;s have much of &quot;Lupo&quot;″s equipment, but arranged differently. Endurance was increased with the &quot;Maestrale&quot; class from .

The &quot;Maestrale&quot;s have half the OTOMATs of the &quot;Lupo&quot; class but twice as many torpedo launchers (with the introduction of the new heavy torpedoes), twice the helicopters, and twice the sonars, having also a VDS. This, coupled with heavy torpedoes and two helicopters, improved dramatically the ASW capabilities. The use of more modern equipment and an Albatross missile system improved in some aspects the air defense.

The &quot;Maestrale&quot; class has some shortcomings. The most prominent is the air-defense layout: while the &quot;Lupo&quot; class has the four weapons distributed across the entire hull length, &quot;Maestrale&quot;s, because of the double hangar, lacked this ability, resulting in all of the weapons systems being placed on the foredeck and midships. This arrangement leaves dangerous blind spots in the ships&#x27; defenses.

After their entry in service, &quot;Maestrale&quot;s were modernized with some minor programs. The equipment present on the &quot;Maestrale&quot;-class ships is almost equal to what it was in 1982, except for a pair of 20 mm guns installed as &#x27;anti-fast vessels close defense&#x27;, in 2005.

==Export==

===Philippines===

A delegation from the Philippines&#x27; Department of National Defense (DND) inspected ships of both the &quot;Maestrale&quot; and Soldati classes of frigates during their visit to Italy in February 2012 as possible candidates for the Deep Water Patrol Vessel project of the Philippine Navy. No indication of sales was made.

A press conference by the DND on 2 August 2012 included the announcement of ongoing negotiations with the Italian government to purchase two &quot;Maestrale&quot; frigates for PhP 11.7 (approx. $240 million) billion and are expected to be delivered within 2013 after refurbishing. On 22 September the Philippines&#x27; Congress approved a budget that includes funding for the two frigates. The negotiations for the &quot;Maestrale&quot;-class ships were concluded without agreement to sell and transfers the ships, with the Philippine government opting to buy new frigates instead.

On 4 July 2013, it was announced that the Philippines would acquire two new frigates. The cost of the acquisition would be $400 million for two new frigates, with the Philippines rejecting the Italian Navy&#x27;s offer of refurbished &quot;Maestrale&quot;-class frigates.

===Indonesia===

On 10 June 2021, Ministry of Defense of Indonesia signed a contract with Fincantieri for acquisition of six FREMM frigates, two &quot;Maestrale&quot;-class frigates and other related logistical support. The two &quot;Maestrale&quot; class will be acquired and modernized by Fincantieri after the ships were retired from the Italian Navy.

===Ecuador===

On 24 April 2024, Ecuador began negotiations with Italy to acquire two &quot;Maestrale&quot;-class frigates as replacement for their aging &quot;Condell&quot;-class frigates.

<doc id="462801" wikidata="Q934785" url="?curid=462801" title="Trzcianka">
<text>Trzcianka (; ) is a town in the Greater Poland region in northwestern Poland. Since 1999, it has been part of the Greater Poland Voivodeship and Czarnków-Trzcianka County. From 1975 to 1998, it was located in the Piła Voivodeship. In May 2007, Trzcianka had 17,131 inhabitants. Trzcianka is located on the , and three lakes, Sarcze, Okunie and Długie, are located within the town limits.

==History==

The settlement, initially named Rozdróżka, was probably founded in the 13th century. It was located on a trade route which connected Poznań and Kołobrzeg. Rozdróżka was mentioned in a document from 1245, when Duke Boleslaus V of Poland gave the land in the Noteć river valley, along with three villages (Biała, Gulcz, and Rozdróżka) to a Polish nobleman named Sędziwój of Czarnków. The new name of these three combined villages was Trzciana Łąka, as it appeared for the first time in 1565, and it was subsequently changed to Trzcianka in the 17th century.

Trzciana Łąka was a private village of Polish nobility, administratively located in the Poznań County in the Poznań Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown, and in the 17th century it became a settlement of weavers and clothiers. It was owned by the Gembicki family, thanks to whom it developed, and in 1679 Andrzej Gembicki referred to it as a town. In 1671 Polish King Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki issued a privilege which established new annual fairs in Trzcianka. It was granted town rights by King Augustus II the Strong in 1731. In the mid-18th century it was owned by the magnate Stanisław Poniatowski, father of the last Polish King Stanisław August Poniatowski, and the Poniatowskis&#x27; Ciołek coat of arms has been the town&#x27;s coat of arms since. In the 18th century, Trzcianka was one of the leading clothmaking centers in Greater Poland, however, after the late 18th century Partitions of Poland and the annexation of the town by Prussia in 1772, the local economy collapsed.

In 1807 the town was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815, it was re-annexed by Prussia, and from 1871 it was also part of Germany and was known as &quot;Schönlanke&quot;. The Prussian Eastern Railway, inaugurated in 1851 brought an economic boom to the town. Schönlanke had belonged to the Czarnikau district in the Province of Posen until 1920, after which it became the seat of the newly established Netzekreis district in the Province of Posen-West Prussia.

In the final months of World War II, Soviet troops marching towards Berlin from the east entered the town on 27 January 1945. Around this time, about 500 people committed suicide. Following the war, the abandoned town was eventually restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which remained in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. In August 1980, employees of local factories joined the nationwide anti-communist strikes, which led to the foundation of the &quot;Solidarity&quot; organization.

==Culture==
There is a local historic museum (&quot;Muzeum Ziemi Nadnoteckiej&quot;) in Trzcianka.

==Cuisine==
The officially protected traditional food originating from Trzcianka is &quot;kiełbasa swojska nadnotecka&quot;, a local type of kiełbasa (as designated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland).

==Notable people==
* Michael Solomon Alexander, first Protestant Bishop of Jerusalem was born here
* Andrzej Aumiller (born 1947), Polish politician, and Member of Parliament was born here

<text>Aaron Brown (November 10, 1948 – December 29, 2024) was an American broadcast journalist most recognized for his coverage of the September 11 attacks for CNN. He was a longtime reporter for ABC, the founding host of ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Now&quot;, weekend anchor of &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, and the host of CNN&#x27;s flagship evening program &quot;NewsNight with Aaron Brown.&quot; He was the anchor of the PBS documentary series &quot;Wide Angle&quot; from 2008 to 2009. He was a professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University from 2007 to 2014.

==Career==

===Early life and career===
Brown was born to a Jewish family in Minneapolis on November 10, 1948. He was the third of five children of Rose, a home-maker, and Morton, a scrap-metal dealer. In 1966, Brown dropped out of the University of Minnesota as a political science major and joined the U.S. Coast Guard reserves. He began his broadcasting career as a radio talk show host in Minneapolis and later in Los Angeles. Before his time at the national news networks, Brown was a Seattle broadcasting staple, spending more than 15 years at television stations there, first at KING-TV, the NBC affiliate, and then KIRO-TV the CBS affiliate. He was hired by Seattle&#x27;s KING TV in 1976, initially working as an assignment editor but soon becoming a reporter and eventually anchor. In 1986 he moved to KIRO, where he anchored the evening newscast, and remained with KIRO until December 1991.

===ABC===
Brown was brought to New York City to be the founding anchor of the late-night news program &quot;World News Now&quot;. He also worked as a reporter for ABC&#x27;s news operation. He left &quot;World News Now&quot; to work as a reporter for &quot;World News Tonight&quot; with Peter Jennings, as well as &quot;Nightline&quot; and various other ABC programming. He became the substitute anchor for Jennings and the permanent anchor of ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Tonight Saturday&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America Sunday&quot;.

===CNN===

====9/11====
Although Brown&#x27;s first day at CNN was July 1, 2001, his first on-air broadcast was September 11, 2001. He received international recognition as well as winning the Edward R. Murrow Award for his reporting of the attacks from CNN&#x27;s rooftop in Manhattan, as well as the World Trade Center site and the areas surrounding the remains of the Twin Towers in New York City.

When the South Tower collapsed, Brown was listening to a report from the site of The Pentagon, where there was another attack. The building started to fall while Brown was offcamera, and he had to interrupt the reporter so he could report on what he had seen. Brown remarked that there was another massive explosion and that he could not see the building anymore (he was not aware that the entire building had fallen yet). As the second tower fell on live television, Brown fell silent, until he quietly said, &quot;...good Lord...there are no words...&quot; and resumed reporting after several seconds. 
CNN saw Brown as a protégé of Peter Jennings and wanted to duplicate Jennings&#x27; success for their network. CNN branded their flagship evening program &quot;NewsNight with Aaron Brown&quot;. Brown also served as host of &quot;CNN Presents&quot; and was assigned the lead anchor during breaking news and special events.

====Post 9/11====
Brown covered numerous other news events for CNN, including the War on Terrorism, the 2002 House and Senate elections, the Beltway sniper attacks and the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brown anchored from the CNN Center in Atlanta, providing viewers with the latest information from frontline reports as well as from Washington, D.C., and United States Central Command in Doha, Qatar.

In 2003, he garnered negative press attention for continuing to play in the Bob Hope Classic golf tournament in Palm Desert, California, after the &quot;Columbia&quot; Space Shuttle disaster occurred. While other major news anchors such as Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings, and Dan Rather immediately left their vacations, Brown did not come into the studio and instead continued playing golf. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Brown had actually been trying to get back to the studios, but CNN didn&#x27;t go to special lengths to move Brown into position because Miles O&#x27;Brien, the channel&#x27;s space expert, was anchoring the unfolding events.

During the United States 2004 presidential election, CNN used the NASDAQ Market Site for its election coverage, which some point to as the birth of the idea for Wolf Blitzer&#x27;s &quot;The Situation Room&quot;. Brown was tasked to periodically make commentaries on the trends of the evening&#x27;s results, while Anderson Cooper was then tasked at monitoring key Senate and House races.

Brown won three Emmys, including one Emmy for his report &quot;Streets of Iraq&quot; during the Iraq War. In addition, Brown won a DuPont, two New York Film Society World medals and a George Foster Peabody Award.

On November 3, 2005, CNN announced that Brown would be leaving the network, with Anderson Cooper&#x27;s program &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot; replacing NewsNight as the flagship program in CNN&#x27;s evening lineup in an effort to shift toward a younger demographic. The two had shared anchoring duties in the 10:00 PM time slot through the early fall after Cooper&#x27;s breakout success covering Hurricane Katrina. Many said Brown&#x27;s cerebral &quot;news for grown-ups&quot; style would be missed.

===Public broadcasting===
Brown was under contract with CNN until June 2007, which prevented him from doing interviews or returning to television. In 2008, he returned to television as the host of PBS&#x27;s &quot;Wide Angle&quot;. Brown was anchor of the series, and did reports from the field through the end of the series on September 2, 2009.

==In academia==
In 2006, Brown assumed the John J. Rhodes Chair in Public Policy and American Institutions at Barrett, the Honors College at Arizona State University. He taught a course called &quot;Turning Points in Television News History&quot; at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism at ASU from 2007 to 2014.

==Personal life and death==
While working in Seattle in 1980, Brown met fellow newscaster Charlotte Raynor. They wed in 1982. They had one daughter, Gabby (b. 1988). Brown died of pneumonia in Washington, D.C. on December 29, 2024, at the age of 76.

<doc id="462812" wikidata="Q518086" url="?curid=462812" title="Stephen Tomašević of Bosnia">
<text>Stephen Tomašević or Stephen II (; – 25 May 1463) was the last sovereign from the Bosnian Kotromanić dynasty, reigning as Despot of Serbia briefly in 1459 and as King of Bosnia from 1461 until 1463.

Stephen&#x27;s father, King Thomas, had great ambitions for him. An attempt to expand into Croatia by marrying Stephen to a wealthy noblewoman failed, and negotiations for a marital alliance with the Sforzas of Milan were abandoned when a more prestigious opportunity presented itself: marriage to the heiress Maria of Serbia. Celebrated in April 1459, it made Stephen the ruler of the remnants of the neighbouring country. The intent was to unite the Kingdom of Bosnia and the Serbian Despotate under Stephen to combat the expanding Ottoman Empire. However, Stephen&#x27;s Catholicism made him unpopular in Orthodox Serbia. After ruling it for merely two months, he surrendered it to the encroaching Ottoman forces and fled back to his father&#x27;s court, which earned him the contempt of the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus and other Christian rulers in Europe.

Stephen succeeded his father on the throne following the latter&#x27;s death in July 1461 and became the first Bosnian king to receive a crown from the Holy See. The kingdom&#x27;s existence, however, was increasingly threatened by the Ottomans. King Stephen had the unanimous support of his noblemen in resistance to the Ottomans, but not of the common people. He maintained an active correspondence with Pope Pius II, who forgave him for the loss of Serbia and worked with him to preserve Bosnia for Christendom. The Hungarian king was placated, but all Western monarchs contacted by Stephen refused to assist him. Confident that at least Matthias would come to his aid, Stephen refused to deliver the customary tribute to the Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, which provoked an invasion. In May 1463, Mehmed marched into Bosnia, meeting little effective resistance, and captured Stephen, who was then beheaded. The execution marks the fall of the Kingdom of Bosnia to the Ottoman Empire.

==Family==
Born in 1438, Stephen hailed from the House of Kotromanić as one of the two known sons of the Bosnian prince Thomas by a commoner named Vojača. The other son died as an adolescent. Stephen&#x27;s father was an adulterine son of King Ostoja and a younger brother of Radivoj, who contested the rule of their cousin King Tvrtko II. Thomas was politically inactive and did not take part in the struggle between his brother and cousin, enabling his family to lead a quiet life in a period when the Ottomans tried to weaken the Kingdom of Bosnia by encouraging internal divisions. This all changed when the ailing and childless King Tvrtko II decreed that Thomas should succeed him. The King died shortly after, in November 1443, and Stephen&#x27;s father ascended the throne. 

King Thomas, raised as a member of the Bosnian Church, converted to Roman Catholicism in c. 1445; Stephen Tomašević later stated that he had been baptized into the Roman Catholic Church as a child, and that he had been taught Latin letters. At about that time, likely in order to allow for a peaceful solution to his protracted war with the magnate Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, King Thomas requested from Pope Eugene IV an annulment of his union with Stephen&#x27;s mother. Open warfare ended in 1446 with the marriage of Stephen&#x27;s father to Kosača&#x27;s daughter Catherine, by whom Stephen had a half-brother named Sigismund and a half-sister named Catherine.

== Marriage ==

In the 1450s, King Thomas vigorously searched for suitable spouses for the children from his first union. Stephen&#x27;s two sisters were married off in 1451, and in 1453 Stephen too entered his father&#x27;s considerations. Wishing to gain control over the allodial land of Petar Talovac, who had governed Croatia proper as ban on behalf of the Hungarian king, Thomas attempted to have Stephen marry Talovac&#x27;s widow, Hedwig Garai. Kosača too hastened to marry the wealthy widow, leading to an armed conflict, but neither prevailed due to an intervention by the Republic of Venice on behalf of Talovac&#x27;s heirs.

The earliest source mentioning Stephen by name dates from 30 April 1455, when Pope Callixtus III put the King of Bosnia and his son under his protection. King Thomas&#x27;s ambitions for Stephen grew as he strived to establish closer relations with the Western world. In 1456, he asked the Pope to procure a bride for his son, specifying that she should be a princess from a royal house. Negotiations soon commenced about Stephen&#x27;s marriage to an illegitimate daughter of Francesco I Sforza, Duke of Milan, but Stephen&#x27;s father had greater expectations.

When Lazar Branković, Despot of Serbia, died in 1458, an interregnum ensued. Having left three daughters and no sons, he had no clear heir, so the power was shared between his blinded brother Stephen and widow Helen Palaiologina. King Thomas took advantage of their weakness to recapture Eastern Bosnian towns he had lost to Serbia in 1445. Shortly afterwards, he entered peace negotiations with Lazar&#x27;s widow, Helen Palaiologina. Abandoning the prospect of his son&#x27;s marriage to a daughter of the Duke of Milan, Thomas came to an agreement with Helen: Stephen was to marry the eldest of her three daughters by Lazar, the 11-year-old Helen. The match was prestigious for Stephen not only because of the bride&#x27;s descent from the Byzantine imperial family, but also because it brought the government of Serbia to the groom.

The Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus agreed to Stephen&#x27;s engagement with Helen – it was in his interest to create a strong buffer zone between his realm and the Ottoman Empire by uniting the Kingdom of Bosnia and the Despotate of Serbia, which he considered Hungary&#x27;s vassal states, under Stephen Tomašević. The Diet of Hungary confirmed Stephen Tomašević&#x27;s right to Serbia in January 1459.

== Despotism ==

Stephen, accompanied by his uncle Radivoj, duly set out for Serbia but narrowly escaped imprisonment during an Ottoman raid on the Bosnian royal residence of Bobovac. He arrived to Smederevo, capital of the Eastern Orthodox despotate, during the Holy Week of 1459, and ascended the Serbian throne on 21 March. Michael Szilágyi, regent for the underage King Matthias, arrived at the head of an army to ensure that command over the town&#x27;s fortress would be assumed by Stephen without any difficulties.

Stephen&#x27;s marriage to Helen took place on 1 April, the first Sunday following Easter. Following the presumably Catholic ceremony, the bride was known as Maria. He assumed the title of despot, despite the fact that the title was neither hereditary nor tied to a specific territory, but a grant from the Byzantine emperor. It is possible that his mother-in-law, a member of Byzantium&#x27;s last imperial family, believed that she had the right to grant the title in the absence of an emperor. Within a week of the wedding, Stephen exiled his wife&#x27;s uncle from Serbia. King Thomas boasted to the Duke of Milan that his son had been made despot &quot;with the agreement and will of all the Rascians&quot;, but Stephen&#x27;s regime was not particularly popular; chroniclers writing about his treatment of his wife&#x27;s uncle cursed him as a schismatic. 

It was clear from the onset that Stephen&#x27;s reign in Serbia would be short-lived. The Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror considered Stephen&#x27;s enthronement an unwarranted violation of his own rights, for the Ottomans too considered Serbia their vassal state. Mehmed promptly launched an attack on Smederevo in June, and there was no serious consideration of trying to defend it. King Thomas rushed to his son&#x27;s aid, trying to divert the Turks by laying siege to their fortress of Hodidjed, in the middle of Bosnia. Aware that Smederevo could not withstand Mehmed&#x27;s attack, Stephen surrendered the fortress on 20 June. The Ottoman proceeded to annex the rest of the Serbian state to their empire within a year.

Following the fall of the town which Pope Pius II lamentably termed &quot;the gateway to Rascia&quot;, Stephen fled to Bosnia with his family and in-laws, seeking refuge at the court of his father. The King of Hungary accused Stephen and his family of selling Smederevo Fortress to the Ottomans &quot;for a great weight of gold&quot;, and the Pope at first believed him. Pius&#x27;s own investigation appears to have come to the conclusion that Stephen did not sell the fortress, as the Pope did not repeat the claim. Ottoman, Bosnian and Serbian sources say nothing about the supposed betrayal, so the allegation is unlikely to be based on fact. The Serbian-born janissary Konstantin Mihailović and the Byzantine Greek scholar Laonikos Chalkokondyles maintained Stephen&#x27;s innocence and pointed out to the strength of the Ottoman army. Both state that the Serbs within Smederevo were so unhappy with Bosnian rule and convinced that the Ottomans would prevail (and grant them more religious tolerance than the Hungarians) that they went out to meet Mehmed and presented him with keys to the city.

==Kingship==
=== Accession and coronation ===

King Thomas died in July 1461. According to later accounts, Thomas&#x27;s death was plotted by Stephen and Radivoj, and even Matthias and Mehmed were implicated. Historians dismiss these allegations, however, pointing out that the King had been ill since June. Stephen ascended the throne without difficulty. He ensured that his uncle would not contest the succession by generously endowing him with land. The new monarch assumed the pompous title inherited from Tvrtko I, the first Bosnian king, styling himself as, &quot;by the Grace of God, King of Serbia, Bosnia, the Maritime Lands, Zachlumia, Dalmatia, Croatia, and the Western lands&quot; – regardless of the fact that Serbia had by then become an Ottoman pashaluk, that Croatia had been lost to Hungary in the 1390s, and that he had to beg the government of the Republic of Venice to allow him to take refuge in Dalmatia in case of an Ottoman attack.

Immediately upon his accession, Stephen set out to resolve all disagreements within the royal family in order to strengthen his own position. His relations with his stepmother, the 37-year-old Queen Catherine, had been strained during his father&#x27;s lifetime, but he now guaranteed that she would retain her title and privileges. Her father, Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, wrote to Venetian officials that the King had &quot;taken her as his mother&quot;, Vojača having already died by the time he ascended the throne. Kosača was the kingdom&#x27;s most powerful nobleman, and had been engaged in a never-ending conflict with Stephen&#x27;s father. Stephen Tomašević took the Venetians&#x27; advice to make peace with his stepgrandfather, thus finally ensuring the nobility&#x27;s absolute support of their king. He then focused on improving Bosnia&#x27;s economy, which became stronger than ever during his reign, and ensuring that the state would collect more profit from the flourishing metalworking trade.

Problems rose soon already in the summer of 1461, when Pavao Špirančić, who governed Croatia as ban on behalf of the Hungarian king and frequently clashed with King Thomas, seized a border town. By late summer, Stephen and Kosača were preparing to strike him jointly and divide his territory between themselves. Venice objected, fearing that the fortresses Klis and Ostrovica, paramount to the defense of Dalmatia, might fall to the Ottomans if first taken over by the Bosnians.

King Stephen wasted no time to solidify his relations with the Holy See. He sent a desperate plea to Pope Pius, asking him to send bishops, crusading weapons, and a coronation crown, as well as to be recommended to Matthias Corvinus. Stephen hoped that, with the Pope&#x27;s urging, the Hungarian king would agree to provide him with military aid. On 17 November, the feast of Saint Gregory Thaumaturgus, who had been proclaimed &quot;Defender of Bosnia&quot; at royal request, the papal legate and newly appointed bishop Nicholas of Modruš crowned Stephen in the Church of Saint Mary in Jajce. It was the last coronation performed in Bosnia, as well as the only one performed with a crown sent from Rome. It exemplified how, with the religious persecution established by Thomas and with Stephen&#x27;s active correspondence with the papacy, the Kingdom of Bosnia acquired the character of a true Catholic state only at its very end.

The belated attempt at sanctification of the Bosnian monarchy gravely offended the Hungarian king Matthias, who saw the Pope&#x27;s involvement in the coronation as an infringement of the rights of Hungarian kings. Matthias went so far as to request that the Pope withdraw his support of Stephen. Pope Pius and Bishop John Vitéz mediated in the dispute between the kings of Bosnia and Hungary, but the negotiations did not proceed easily. The relations were finally repaired in the spring of 1462. Matthias was driven by the need to ransom the Crown of St Stephen from Emperor Frederick III, and Stephen was obliged to contribute. In return for the Hungarian king&#x27;s good graces, Stephen was also required to cede certain towns, swear fealty and to refuse to pay tribute to the Ottomans.

=== Ottoman invasion ===

By the spring of 1462, it was known that Mehmed had decided to conquer Bosnia. Stephen and Kosača desperately sought help from Christian rulers. The King maintained contact with the Pope, who had his legates stay permanently at the Bosnian royal court and who strived to concentrate as many soldiers and as much weapons as possible in the threatened kingdom. The authorities of the neighbouring Republic of Ragusa were enlisted to secure the support of the Albanian ruler Skanderbeg, who was subsequently allowed by the Venetians to pass with his army through Venetian Albania on their way to Bosnia. Venice itself promised no assistance, suggesting instead that Stephen and Kosača should trust in their own forces. Others, such as King Ferdinand I of Naples, cited domestic issues and offered nothing more than moral support. 

While doing everything possible to secure foreign aid, King Stephen found that there was little will to resist within the country. He complained to Pope Pius that the local population leaned towards the Ottomans, which may have been due to increased exploitation and incessant warfare (as opposed to a stable Ottoman regime). The previously tacit discontent of forcefully converted elders of the Bosnian Church became prominent. According to a contemporary, Stephen generously bestowed gifts and honors in order to inspire loyalty, and awarded fortified towns to untrustworthy people, even including former &quot;heretics&quot;. The greatest blow to the defense efforts, however, was the old conflict between Kosača and his son Vladislav Hercegović, which was resumed in the spring of 1462. Vladislav personally sought help from Mehmed later that year, and the Ottoman ruler eagerly accepted. 

Encouraged by Matthias&#x27;s commitment to help and possibly by the Bishop of Modruš, Stephen Tomašević made an imprudent and fatal decision in June 1462. Pope Pius wrote in his diary that, &quot;relying on one knows what hope&quot;, the King &quot;refused the tributes which his ancestors had long been used to pay the Ottomans and had stormed the town which the enemy had built at the confluence of Sava and Bosna to put fear into the Hungarians and Slavs.&quot; According to Chalkokondyles, Stephen invited the Ottoman ambassador to his treasure house and showed him the money set aside as tribute, but informed him that he would rather use it to fight off an Ottoman attack or to live off it in exile. Mehmed the Conqueror was enraged by Stephen&#x27;s insubordinance and audacity. The Pope recounts how, hearing of the Sultan&#x27;s vow to conquer his kingdom and destroy him, Stephen summoned the Bishop of Modruš and blamed him for infuriating the Sultan. He commanded Nicholas to go to Hungary and seek immediate action against the Ottomans, but no help ever arrived to Bosnia from Christendom. Matthias, Skenderbeg and the Ragusans all failed to carry out their promises.

In the spring of 1463, Mehmed gathered an army of 150,000 men in Adrianople and prepared to march towards Bosnia. In his despair, Stephen Tomašević turned to the Sultan himself and tried at the last moment to procure a 15-year-long truce with him. Konstantinović claimed that he was present when the Ottomans duped the Bosnian envoys into thinking that the King&#x27;s request for truce was granted, and that he tried to warn them about the deceit. Mehmed&#x27;s army set out right after the envoys. Fortresses fell rapidly, and King Stephen fled with his family and possessions from Bobovac to Jajce. The Ottoman army under the leadership of Mahmud Pasha Angelović laid siege to Bobovac on 19 May, with the Sultan joining them the following day. Angelović was tasked with capturing the King. Believing that Bobovac could withstand the siege for two years, Stephen planned to assemble an army in Jajce, still counting on foreign aid. He sent his wife with their possessions to Dalmatia, while his stepmother took the rest to Ragusa.

=== Capture and death ===

Contrary to Stephen Tomašević&#x27;s expectations, Bobovac fell within days. The King had already realized that he had no choice but to take refuge in the neighbouring Croatia or Dalmatia. Angelović tirelessly pursued him, and caught up with him in Ključ. The Ottoman army was reportedly about to pass the city&#x27;s fortress, not suspecting that the King was hiding within its walls, when a local man revealed his whereabouts in return for money. A four-day-long siege of the fortress ensued. Eager to capture him, Angelović had his messengers solemnly promise the King that he would be done no harm if he surrendered, and sent him a document guaranteeing him freedom. With food supplies and ammunition running short, Stephen decided to surrender himself and his garrison to Angelović. Angelović, in turn, brought him, his uncle Radivoj and 13-year-old cousin Tvrtko before Mehmed in Jajce.

Stephen sought to ingratiate himself with Mehmed by sending out orders to commanders and castellans to surrender, enabling his captor to take command of more than 70 towns in one week. Mehmed, however, had no intention of sparing Stephen&#x27;s life and summoned him on 25 May. Stephen fearfully brought Angelović&#x27;s document, but Mehmed&#x27;s Persian-born mullah, Ali al-Bistami, issued a &quot;fatwah&quot; declaring that the Sultan was not bound to keep the promise made by his servant without his knowledge. As if to demonstrate the validity of his &quot;fatwah&quot;, the elderly mullah took out his sword and beheaded Stephen in front of Mehmed. The chronicler Benedetto Dei, who claimed to have been part of the Sultan&#x27;s retinue, recorded that Mehmed himself decapitated Stephen. According to later accounts, Mehmed had Stephen flayed or used as a shooting target. The execution of the King, his uncle, cousin and two noblemen took place in a field next to Jajce, which has since been known as Carevo Polje (&quot;the Emperor&#x27;s Field&quot;).

== Assessment and legacy ==
Stephen Tomašević was buried on a hill near Jajce. Europe was stunned to see the Bosnian state fall almost completely within weeks of his death. The country&#x27;s quick submission is said to be the consequence of a poor cooperation between Stephen and his noblemen, but it is perhaps most accurate to attribute it to the people&#x27;s low morale and general belief that the conquest was inevitable. Additionally, the religiously diverse Bosnians were aware, much like the neighbouring Serbians, that the country would be overrun by Hungary if not by the Ottomans, and that they would enjoy far less freedom of religion and far higher taxes in that case. Therefore, resistance was not as strong as it could have been. Pope Pius&#x27;s claim that adherents of the Bosnian Church betrayed the kingdom is groundless.
Stephen Tomašević&#x27;s half-siblings were taken to Constantinople and converted to Islam. Queen Catherine, his stepmother, left for the Papal States and unsuccessfully campaigned for the restoration of the kingdom; Bosnia only ceased to be part of the Ottoman Empire in 1908, 445 years after Stephen&#x27;s death. His widow, Queen Maria, spent the rest of her life in the Empire.

In 1888, the Croatian archeologist Ćiro Truhelka excavated bones in a settlement close to Jajce known as Kraljev Grob (meaning King&#x27;s Tomb) and found the skeleton of a decapitated adult male. The head was placed on the chest, with two coins in the mouth. Though by no means certain, it was assumed that the skeleton belonged to Stephen Tomašević. Despite objection from the friar Antun Knežević, who argued for leaving the bones where they had laid for centuries and constructing a small church at the site, the skeleton was placed in a glass coffin in the right aisle of the Franciscan monastery in Jajce.

<text>The Senate () is the upper house of the Polish parliament, the lower house being the Sejm. The history of the Polish Senate stretches back over 500 years; it was one of the first constituent bodies of a bicameral parliament in Europe and existed without hiatus until the final partition of the Polish state in 1795. The contemporary Senate is composed of 100 senators elected by a universal ballot and is headed by the Marshal of the Senate (&quot;Marszałek Senatu&quot;). The incumbent Marshal of the Senate is Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.

Following a brief period of existence under the Second Polish Republic, the Senate was again abolished by the authorities of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic. It was not re-established until the collapse of the communist government and reinstatement of democracy in Poland in 1989. The Senate is based in Warsaw and is located in a building which forms part of the Sejm Complex on Wiejska Street, in close proximity to the Three Crosses Square and Ujazdów Castle.

Like most parliaments in the European Union, Poland&#x27;s parliament is asymmetric, where the lower chamber is dominant over the upper chamber. Unlike the Sejm, the Senate cannot unilaterally veto legislation nor can it bring down the government in a vote of no confidence, and the chamber and its members generally receive far less attention compared to the Sejm.

==Role==
In line with Article 10, Paragraph 2, and Article 95 of the Polish Constitution of 2 April 1997, the Senate and the Sejm exercise legislative power. The Senate is composed of 100 senators who are elected for a term of four years in general election in a direct vote by secret ballot. Alongside the Sejm, the President of the Polish Republic, the Council of Ministers and all citizens of Poland, the Senate has the right to take legislative initiatives.

If it is necessary for the Sejm and Senate to convene jointly as a general session of the National Assembly, this joint session will be chaired by the Marshal of the Sejm or by the Marshal of the Senate. The Senate is allowed 30 days to examine any piece of draft legislation passed by the Sejm, 14 days if a bill is considered to be urgent. Any bill submitted by the Sejm to the Senate may be adopted by the latter without any amendments or amended or rejected (but any rejection or amendment may still be overruled by an absolute majority vote in the Sejm). Any resolution of the Senate, as a result of which a bill is repealed or amended, is considered to be passed provided it has not been rejected by the Sejm.

However, for the state budget, the Senate has 20 days to examine it. For amending the constitution, the Senate has 60 days for analysis. If the constitution is amended, identical wording of the amendment must be approved by both the Sejm and the Senate.

The president cannot decide to stage a nationwide referendum on matters of national importance unless he or she has been given explicit permission to do so by the Senate. The Senate is also empowered to examine any reports submitted by the Commissioner for the Protection of Citizens&#x27; Rights and the National Broadcasting Council. Other than its significant involvement in the legislative process, the Senate is required to grant its consent in the case of appointment or removal of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control, the President of the Institute of National Remembrance – Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation, the Commissioner for Protection of Citizens&#x27; Rights and the Ombudsman for Children and the General Inspector for Personal Data Protection.

However, unlike the Sejm, the Senate has no role in providing for oversight of the executive. The Senate currently appoints one member of the National Broadcasting Council, two members of the Council of the Institute of National Remembrance, two of its own senators to sit on the National Judiciary Board and three members of the Monetary Policy Council of the National Bank. The Marshal of the Senate and any 30 senators may also request the Constitutional Tribunal to examine any act of domestic legislation or international agreement to check that it complies with the constitution, ratified international agreements, and other legislation.

Since the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Senate also has the right to report issues about option and implementation of European legislation in Poland to the central authorities of the European Union.

==History==
===Kingdom and Commonwealth===
The Senate can be traced back approximately five hundred years to a council of royal advisors. In the Nobles&#x27; Democracy, the Senate was a privy council rather than an upper chamber of the Sejm, and consisted of members of the royal cabinet and the royal court, together with burgraves, voivodes, prefects and castellans (all appointed by the king), and Catholic bishops (see Senatorial offices for details). It was not until 1453 that the first mention was made of a two chamber legislative body in which the &#x27;lords&#x27; of the kingdom were represented in a &#x27;council of lords&#x27;, however, by 1493 the Sejm, made up of the king, Senate and Chamber of Deputies was finally established as a permanent legislative body for the Polish kingdom.

In 1501 at Mielnik, senators attempted to force the soon to be crowned king Alexander I Jagiellon to devolve all royal powers relating to the governing of the state to them. However, whilst Alexander first agreed, after his coronation he refused to affirm this privilege. Later the Nihil Novi act of 1505 affirmed the right of both the Chamber of Deputies and Senate to propagate common law for the kingdom. In 1529 the Senate finally reached a decision on its own composition; after the accession of Mazovia to the Kingdom of Poland, the Senate became composed of Roman Catholic diocesan bishops, voivodes, lesser and greater castellans, ministers (grand chamberlain, chancellor, deputy chancellors, grand treasurer and court Marshal), all of whom were appointed for life by the king. At this time the competences of the Senate were also laid down as pertaining to participation in legislation, foreign policy and the Sejm Court.
In 1537 the Senate followed a course of action which would have seen it become the most important institution in protecting landowners’ rights and freedoms. However, this view was at odds with those of Sigismund I the Old who believed that the Senate was becoming far too powerful. Resultantly, over the period of 1562–69, the Senate lost many of its powers and influence, eventually becoming subordinate to its formerly-equal companion body, the Chamber of Deputies. In 1569 a very important milestone was achieved when the Union of Lublin was signed and senators of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were incorporated into the Royal Senate of Poland in order to form the Senate of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In addition to this, senators from the autonomous Duchy of Prussia, a fiefdom of the Polish king, were incorporated after having been absent since gaining autonomy in 1466. After these developments the Senate was composed of 142 senators: 15 bishops, 35 provincial governors, 31 greater castellans, 47 lesser castellans and 14 ministers.


This old senate did not include the separate post of the Senate Marshal. The Senate&#x27;s sessions were presided over by the king, who was represented in person by the &#x27;grand royal marshal&#x27;, a figure who could ultimately be described as prime minister of the kingdom. It was this marshal who, on behalf of the king, presided over joint sessions (in which both the Senate and Chamber of Deputies took part) of the Sejm. Should the grand royal marshal by absent, sessions were presided over by the court&#x27;s crown marshal. Both of these two marshals sat in the Senate and, like other senators, enjoyed a lifelong appointment by the king.

The most important senator or &#x27;president of the senate&#x27; was, at the time, the archbishop of Gniezno who, as Primate of Poland and &#x27;first Duke of the Kingdom&#x27;, was considered to hold the most senior state position below that of the monarch. The archbishop presided over sessions of the Senate during periods of the king&#x27;s absence. The primate even had the right to convene &#x27;secret&#x27; councils with the Senate without the king&#x27;s permission and, should the need arise, even against his will. During periods of interregnum the primate immediately became, by default, the interrex (acting monarch), and thus could convene the Sejm at will.

In 1573 the Senate received new rights under the Henrician Articles; these allowed the Senate to reprimand the king and instructed that the monarch must always be accompanied by an advisory body of at least four senators. The Senate also ruled that the king must not arbitrarily propagate new laws and that he must first consult with the Senate before entering into marriage or agreeing to inter-state alliances. Under King Sigismund III of Poland and later his son, King Władysław IV, the Senate grew in importance and kings began to rule with the help of an advisory body in which they placed most of their trust. This body was colloquially known as the &#x27;Little Senate&#x27; and was made up of a number of highly trusted senators loyal to the king.

In 1631 and 1632 the Senate first used its right to veto constitutional acts adopted by the Chamber of Deputies. This marks the first phase of the Senate&#x27;s demise as powerful nobles (known as the magnates) begin to exercise their power in the legislature. By 1669 the situation had become so bad that landowners took to the streets and, angered by the magnates machinations during the earlier royal election of Michael I, shot at passing senators. By 1717 the king was obliged to implement recommendations given by the senators-resident and by 1773 the cardinal laws pertaining to the &#x27;power of legislating for the Republic in three estates&#x27; had been passed and the Senate had begun to hold joint debates with the Chamber of Deputies as a single &#x27;united&#x27; Sejm. As a result, in 1775, the senators-resident or &#x27;Little Senate&#x27; were abolished and were replaced with a &#x27;Permanent Council&#x27; of senators and deputies headed by the king.

In 1791 a particularly important development took place when the May 3rd Constitution removed the king from the three estate Sejm and transformed the previously equal Chamber of Deputies and Senate into a modern parliament comprising a lower house (Chamber of Deputies) and upper house (Senate). The Senate, however, lost much of its right to legislate and, whilst still appointed by the king, senators were now to be chosen and put forward by provincial legislative bodies known as Sejmiks.

The Senate continued to exist until 1794, right up until the Kościuszko Uprising. In 1795 the third partition of Poland took place, thus ending the first chapter of the Senate&#x27;s history.

===Partitions===
During the existence of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw and the Congress Kingdom of Poland the president of the Senate presided over the Senate; this officer of state was appointed for life by the king, and was chosen from among the ordinary, secular senators. Additionally, in the Congress Kingdom the Senate was on an equal footing with the Chamber of Deputies, it was then composed of bishops, provincial governors, castellans and princes of the imperial blood. Despite this, the Senate of the Congress Kingdom had very little power and was largely a powerless, representative institution.

===Second, People&#x27;s and Third republics===
In the newly re-established Poland after the First World War, the March Constitution of 1921 set out a system whereby the Senate would be led by its Marshal and Deputy Marshals who were elected via a simple majority system by senators from among their ranks, they were then expected to serve for the Senate&#x27;s term of office; the same rules were followed under the April Constitution of 1935. In the Second Polish Republic, senators were elected by universal ballot.

In the 1921 constitution the Senate was established as the upper house of the Polish parliament, which from then on was to be known as the &#x27;National Assembly&#x27;, with the previously overarching term &#x27;Sejm&#x27; being used to refer only to the lower house of parliament. The senate, whilst not having the right to introduce legislation, was entrusted with the right of veto over the Sejm, the right to demand written explanations of policy decisions from government ministers and a part to play in electing, along with the Sejm, the president of the Republic in a unified secret ballot. At the time the Senate was composed of 111 senators, each of whom was elected to represent, along with a number of others, one of Poland&#x27;s sub-national provinces. The term of office for senators amounted to five years. During the inter-war period the senate met in five convocations.

After a failure in 1926 to consolidate its powers and receive the right to introduce legislation, the Senate continued to function in its original 1921 role, until the May Coup of 1926, after which the Senate became the supreme legislative body of the republic and increased its power at the expense of that of the Sejm. However, it was still largely subordinate to the president and, until the death of coup-instigator Józef Piłsudski, Chief of State. After the invasion of Poland by German forces, on 2 November 1939, the president of Poland Ignacy Mościcki ordered that the Senate and Sejm cease to operate and remain in recess until the end of the war, after which elections were ordered to take place within 60 days after the cessation of hostilities; this however, was never to take place.

After a referendum organised in 1946 by the Communist regime, the Senate was abolished in the post-Second World War People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. It is estimated, based on actual results obtained after the fall of Communism in 1989, that should the referendum have been fairly organised, the real outcome would have shown that 73% of respondents were in favour of retaining the Senate in the legislative system and the institution would not have been abolished. Indeed, in Kraków, where the opposition managed to ensure a fair vote, the &#x27;no&#x27; result relating to the question as to whether people favoured the abolition of the Senate was recorded as being 84%.

The Senate was only reestablished after the agreement struck between the Communists and Solidarity in 1989. During the first election to the newly reestablished senate in 1989 the future-president Lech Wałęsa&#x27;s Solidarity Movement won 99 of the 100 seats being contested, with the final seat being taken by an independent. This enormous size of this defeat greatly embarrassed the ruling Polish United Workers&#x27; Party and hastened their exit from power, thus paving the way for the establishment of a democratic Poland and the foundation of the third republic, in which the Senate was to become a permanent upper house of the new bicameral legislature.

==Nowadays==
The term of office of a senator is four years. The Senate may reject or amend the bills passed by the Sejm but any rejection or amendment may still be overruled by an absolute majority vote in the Sejm. A joint session of the Senate and the Sejm is known as a National Assembly. Traditionally, the Senate takes particular care of &quot;Polonia&quot;, Polish communities outside Poland.

Until 2010, senators were elected by a plurality bloc voting method, where two or more candidates with the highest support are elected from each electoral district, and each voter selects as many candidates as there are seats (i.e., there is no proportional representation). The exact number of senators from each electorate was dependent on its population and varied from two to four. Initially, this system was employed in a two-round variant, but it was switched to a one-round version as early as the 1991 Polish parliamentary election.

Since 2011, senators are elected by the single member, one-round first-past-the-post voting method.

==Building==

The Senate building was originally an administrative building of the Polish Sejm that was built in the early 1950s and eventually became the Sejm library. However, in 1989, with the re-establishment of the Senate, the need for a permanent workplace for the new institution became obvious. At the time only the Sejm&#x27;s chamber was big enough to hold Senate debates, so, as a compromise the Senate made temporary use of the Sejm chamber whilst plans for a new Senate building were drawn up. In the meantime the senate&#x27;s administrative offices and facilities for senators were moved into Bohdan Pniewski&#x27;s 1950s east wing of the Sejm complex.

It eventually became clear that the system of alternating with the Sejm in using the latter&#x27;s debating chamber was becoming more and more problematic, and so, after another 18 months, during which the Senate made use of the Hall of Columns in the Sejm, work on the new Senate chamber finally began. The project revolved around a plan designed by architects Andrzej and Barbara Kaliszewski and Bohdan Napieralski, which would see three conference rooms on the first floor of what is now the Senate building combined to make one usable space, whilst not changing the external elevations of the building or significantly changing its interior style or character. Decorated in a scheme close to that of Pniewski&#x27;s, which utilises a great number of soft shades of white and grey, the Senate chamber blends well with the rest of its architectural surroundings. The furniture for the chamber, much of which is upholstered in blueish-grey material was specially designed for the Senate&#x27;s use and incorporates many design features characteristic of 1950s Polish modernism.
Whilst the Senate chamber does have one elevation incorporating large windows, which look out into the Sejm gardens, the specially-designed curtain, which was designed to cover them must always be drawn during debates and it is, in fact, rare to ever see it open. The necessity to close the curtains during debates exists to stop the sun&#x27;s glare from distracting or disturbing senators during plenary sessions. Behind the presidium, the back of which faces the glazed elevation, hangs a large copy of the coat of arms of Poland. On either side of the presidium there are places available for government advisors and independent experts who may be required to take part in debates, whilst at the back, around the edge of the chamber there are a small number of places reserved for the public. There is also a special space reserved for the president of Poland, over which hangs an embroidered copy of the presidential jack.

The hall, which provides entrance to the Senate chamber retains, despite renovation in the early 1990s, its original Pniewski architectural features and now serves as a meetings place for senators and their staff before and between debates. In the centre of this same hall stands an iconic spiral staircase, which has become a symbol of the modern Polish Senate; indeed the central pylon of this staircase is decorated with a marble plaque depicting the Senate&#x27;s traditional emblem, the stylised white eagle intertwined with an &#x27;S&#x27;. To the right of the hall the Senate Marshal&#x27;s office is to be found, along with those of his secretariat and chief of staff. A large reception room also adjoins the hall, and it is in this room that the large oil painting “the Polish Legation and Walezjusz” by Teodor Axentowicz hangs. To the left of the hall is a small foyer for the use of senators and in which hang portraits of all the past marshals of the senate.

The lower floors of the Senate house the administrative offices of the &#x27;Senate Chancellery&#x27; whilst others are used by various legislative experts.

<text>Thirsk is a market town and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England; it is known for its racecourse and depiction as local author James Herriot&#x27;s fictional Darrowby.

==History==

Archeological finds indicate there was a settlement in Thirsk around 500–600 BC. The town&#x27;s name is derived from the Old Norse word &quot;þresk&quot; meaning fen or lake.

Thirsk is mentioned twice in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Tresche&quot;, in the &quot;Yarlestre&quot; wapentake, a village with ten households. At the time of the Norman invasion the manor was split between &quot;Orm&quot; and &quot;Thor&quot;, local Anglo-Saxon landowners. Afterwards, it was split between &quot;Hugh, son of Baldric&quot; and the Crown.

===House of Mowbray===
Most of Thirsk was granted to a Robert from Montbray for whose descendant House of Mowbray and the vale of Mowbray is named.

By 1145, what is now Old Thirsk, gained a Market charter giving it town and borough status. The remaining land in the parish was still under manorial rights.

The Mowbray family built a castle on the north side of Castlegate. It is not mentioned in the Domesday Book and an exact date is not recorded for construction, but it was known to be completely destroyed by 1176 following an uprising against Henry II.

William de Mowbray, 6th Baron of Thirsk, 4th Baron Mowbray, was one of the 25 executors of the Magna Carta in 1215. The Mowbrays built a manor house on the old castle site, which was destroyed by the Scots in 1322. The manor itself continued to be in the Mowbray&#x27;s possession, despite several claims, until the death of the 16th Lord Mowbray in 1476.

===Berkeley and Derby===
After the War of the Roses, Henry VII raised taxes, and that caused uprisings in the north. This led to the murder of Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, either on The Little Green, where he was sent to collect taxes, or in nearby South Kilvington.

With no direct succession, the daughter of Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, who had married into the Berkeley family, inherited the manor. Her son, William de Berkeley, 1st Marquess of Berkeley, inherited it on her death. For some years, the manor was held by Thomas Stanley Earl of Derby, whose successors held it after William&#x27;s death, until 1723.

===Bell, Industrial Revolution and modern===
In that year, it was sold by James, Earl of Derby to Ralph Bell of Sowerby, &quot;whose descendants thereafter held the manor&quot;. It remained in the Bell family into the 20th century.

Thirsk Hall in Kirkgate is a grade II* listed three-storey town house built in 1720 and extended in 1770 by York architect John Carr.

A 1767 Act of Parliament provided for building a navigable waterway to the town from the River Swale along Cod Beck. The project ran out of funds and was never completed, although remains can be seen of the wharf and a lock near Lock Bridge.

A &#x27;squalid&#x27; but &#x27;humane&#x27; poorhouse, for up to 40 paupers of the parish, was established in 1737 between Long Street and St James Green. 100 years later in 1837, the Thirsk Poor Law Union was formed to serve the wider district. Despite mob protests and the &#x27;burning of effigies&#x27;, it erected a workhouse on Sutton Road in 1838, initially with a capacity of 120 beds. At the time of the 1881 census, there were 81 residents, including staff and inmates. The building was used for military and first-aid purposes during World War II. Before conversion to housing, it was used to rear chickens and as a factory.

A rail crash occurred at Manor House signal box on 2 November 1892, on the North Eastern Railway about north of Thirsk railway station, when an express train collided with the back of a goods train, both heading south in fog. There were 10 people killed and 43 injured. Another took place on 31 July 1967 on the East Coast Main Line. On that occasion an express train travelling north collided with a derailed freight train. Seven people were killed and 45 injured.

==Governance==

Thirsk has been in the Thirsk and Malton Parliamentary constituency since its creation for the 2010 general election. Kevin Hollinrake was elected MP at the 2015 UK general election.

The town was a parliamentary borough that had representation in 1295, and then from 1547 to 1885. For the majority of the latter period, it was represented by two members until 1882, when it was reduced to one member.

The constituency of Thirsk and Malton was originally created for the 1885 General Elections by the Redistribution of Seats Act of 1885, and existed until 1983. During that period it returned six Conservative party members to parliament, which included one by-election in 1915.

The Civil Parish of Thirsk was created by the Local Government Act 1894. The Local Government Act 1972 afforded Parish Councils the opportunity to change titles. Thirsk renamed itself a &quot;Town Council&quot;. In so doing, the Chairman was also renamed as &quot;Mayor&quot;. The council is represented by eleven Councillors. The town council meets at Thirsk and Sowerby Town Hall.

==Geography==
Thirsk is in the Vale of Mowbray and situated around the Cod Beck. Within Thirsk, Norby lies to the north-west, and Old Thirsk to the north-east. The separate parish of Sowerby abuts to the south.

Nearby villages with names of Danish origin, identified by the suffix &quot;by&quot; meaning village, include Thirlby, Boltby and Borrowby.

==Demography==

The 1881 UK Census recorded the population of the parish as 3,337.

The parish had a population of 4,703 according to the 2001 Census.

The 2011 UK Census recorded the population as 4,998, an increase of 33% over the past 120 years, with a density of 3.9 people per hectare. Of the total population, 48.9% were male and 51.1% were female. The ethnic make up of the town was 94.3% White British, 3.0% Other White, 0.9% Asian British and 0.2% Black/Mixed and other Ethnic Groups. The religious composition of the town was 71.7% Christian, 27.4% None or no religion stated, 0.3% Muslim, 0.2% Buddhist, 0.1% Hindu, 0.1% Jewish and 0.0% Sikh.

==Economy==
Thirsk&#x27;s medieval market place in the town centre hosts an open-air market each Monday and Saturday. The market was established in 1145 and remains a focal point for traders and visitors. Tourism and hospitality are major parts of the town&#x27;s economy.

Severfield plc based on nearby former RAF Dalton, and VetUK are significant employers in the area.
There is a livestock auction market to the south-east of the town.

The town had a reputation for its leather tanning and saddlery trade, but by the 19th century was better known for the production of agricultural implements.

==Culture==

Thirsk Museum is operated by a team of volunteers in the house where Thomas Lord was born and is now home to Busby&#x27;s stoop chair.

The town&#x27;s former courthouse, in adjoining Sowerby, has been an arts space since 1992.

The World of James Herriot is a visitor attraction in the former home and veterinary surgery of author James Herriot. Scenes from the Channel 5 adaptation of his books were filmed in the town.

Controversially, parts of 2011 splatter film, &quot;Inbred&quot; portrayed Thirsk as Mortlake.

Photography for Pulp&#x27;s &quot;Different Class&quot; album art was taken around Thirsk and includes shots of Thirsk Market Place, Hambleton Estate, Tesco&#x27;s supermarket on Station Road, Sowerby and Ripon Way in nearby Carlton Miniott. Local children feature in pictures accompanying the work known for its track, Common People.

In 2018, the first series of The Heist was filmed in and around Thirsk. The on-screen thieves were all residents of the town or surrounding area, and the crime&#x27;s location was Marage Road. The same year, filming also took place in Thirsk for &quot;The Runaways&quot;.

A character in Downton Abbey refers to an undertaker from Thirsk who can collect bodies on a Sunday. The historical drama also mentions nearby Easingwold and Ripon.

The Thirsk Hall Sculpture Park opened in 2021 in the grounds of Thirsk Hall. Artists that have been featured in the park include Michael Lyons, Zak Ové, and Emily Young.

<text>Fasciculus Chemicus or Chymical Collections. Expressing the Ingress, Progress, and Egress, of the Secret Hermetick Science out of the choicest and most famous authors is an anthology of alchemical writings compiled by Arthur Dee (1579–1651) in 1629 while resident in Moscow as chief physician to Czar Michael I of Russia.

&quot;Fasciculus Chemicus&quot; was revised by Dee sometime between 1631 and 1633 and translated from Latin into English by Elias Ashmole in 1650 under the anagrammatic pseudonym of &quot;James Hasolle&quot; (by substitution of the letter J for I). Arthur Dee however, was displeased with Ashmole&#x27;s translation, and wrote to him:

:&quot;I am sorry you or any man should take pains to translate any book of that art into English, for the art is vilified so much already by scholars that do daily deride it, in regard they are ignorant of the principles. How then can it any way be advanced by the vulgar? But to satisfy your question, you may be resolved that he who wrote Euclid&#x27;s Preface was my father. The &#x27;Fasciculus&#x27;, I confess, was my labour and work.&quot;

Arthur Dee&#x27;s principal sources in his alchemical anthology include Petrus Bonus, John Dastin, Gerhard Dorn, Raymund Lull and Michael Maier. Arthur Dee lists the stages of the alchemical opus in &quot;Fasciculus&quot; as ten in number:

:1. Natural Matter 2. Preparation 3. Weight in preparation 4. The philosopher&#x27;s Fire 5. The Rise or birth of the Stone 6. The Weights of 2nd Work 7. Imbibition 8. Fermentation 9. Projection 10. Multiplication

During the 1650s an easing of regulations on the licensing of printing-presses and the subject-matter of leaflets, pamphlets and books occurred in England. This allowed the newly liberalised printing presses of the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell to cater to the reading public&#x27;s fears and speculations on England&#x27;s future. The social uncertainties engendered by the social trauma of the Civil War, the execution of King Charles I and the establishment of the Commonwealth and Protectorate, resulted in a vigorous interest in esoteric topics during the 1650s decade in England.

Dee&#x27;s anthology was in the vanguard of a revived interest in alchemy in Britain throughout the 1650s, the foremost publication being Ashmole&#x27;s major edition of British alchemical literature, &quot;Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum&quot; (1652). A manuscript copy of &quot;Fasciculus Chemicus&quot; is listed as once in the Library of Sir Thomas Browne.

<text>The solidus (Latin &#x27;solid&#x27;;  solidi) or nomisma () was a highly pure gold coin issued in the Later Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire. It was introduced in the early 4th century, replacing the aureus, and its weight of about 4.5 grams remained relatively constant for seven centuries.

In the Byzantine Empire, the solidus or nomisma remained a highly pure gold coin until the 11th century, when several Byzantine emperors began to strike the coin with less and less gold. The nomisma was finally abolished by Alexios I Komnenos in 1092, who replaced it with the hyperpyron, which also came to be known as a &quot;bezant&quot;. The Byzantine solidus also inspired the zolotnik in the Kievan Rus&#x27; and the originally slightly less pure gold dinar first issued by the Umayyad Caliphate beginning in 697.

In Western Europe, the solidus was the main gold coin of commerce from late Roman times to the Early Middle Ages.

In Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, the solidus also functioned as a unit of weight equal to Roman pound (approximately 4.5 grams).

== Solidus as a Roman coin ==

The solidus was initially introduced by Diocletian in small issues and later reintroduced for mass circulation by Constantine the Great in and was composed of relatively solid gold. Constantine&#x27;s solidus was struck at a rate of 72 to a Roman pound (of about 326.6 g) of gold; each coin weighed 24 Greco-Roman carats 
(189 mg each), or about 4.5 grams of gold per coin. By this time, the solidus was worth 275,000 increasingly debased denarii, each denarius containing just 5% (or one twentieth) of the amount of silver it had three and a half centuries beforehand. With the exception of the early issues of Constantine the Great and the odd usurpers, the solidus today is a much more affordable gold Roman coin to collect, compared to the older aureus, especially those of Heraclius, Honorius and later Byzantine issues.

== In the Byzantine period ==
The solidus was maintained essentially unaltered in weight, dimensions and purity, until the 10th century. During the 6th and 7th centuries &quot;lightweight&quot; solidi of 20, 22 or 23 &quot;siliquae&quot; (one &quot;siliqua&quot; was 1/24 of a solidus) were struck along with the standard weight issues, presumably for trade purposes or to pay tribute. The lightweight solidi were especially popular in the West, and many of these lightweight coins have been found in Europe, Russia and Georgia. The lightweight solidi were distinguished by different markings on the coin, usually in the for the 20 and 22 &quot;siliquae&quot; coins, and by stars in the field for the 23 &quot;siliquae&quot; coins. 

Despite the Eastern half of the Roman Empire being predominantly Greek speaking, its coins were still inscribed in Latin well into the eighth century. The letters in the inscriptions began to lose their Classical Latin look under the emperor Heraclius, and the Latin text was replaced with Greek script in the early years of the ninth century, during the reign of Constantine VI.

In theory, the solidus was struck from pure gold, but because of the limits of refining techniques, in practice – the coins were often about 23k fine (95.8% gold). In the Greek-speaking world during the Roman period, and then in the Byzantine economy, the solidus was known as the νόμισμα (&quot;nomisma&quot;, plural &quot;nomismata&quot;). In the 10th century Emperor Nicephorus II Phocas (963–969) introduced a new lightweight gold coin called the &quot;tetarteron nomisma&quot; that circulated alongside the solidus, and from that time the solidus (&quot;nomisma&quot;) became known as the ἱστάμενον νόμισμα (&quot;histamenon nomisma&quot;), in the Greek speaking world. Initially it was difficult to distinguish the two coins, as they had the same design, dimensions and purity, and there were no marks of value to distinguish the denominations. The only difference was the weight. The &quot;tetarteron nomisma&quot; was a lighter coin, about 4.05 grams, reminiscent of the lightweight solidi of the 6th and 7th centuries, but the &quot;histamenon nomisma&quot; maintained the traditional weight of 4.5 grams. To eliminate confusion between the two, from the reign of Basil II (975–1025) the solidus (&quot;histamenon nomisma&quot;) was struck as a thinner coin with a larger diameter but with the same weight and purity as before. From the middle of the 11th century, the larger diameter &quot;histamenon nomisma&quot; was struck on a concave (cup-shaped) flan, while the smaller &quot;tetarteron nomisma&quot; continued to be struck on a smaller flat flan.

== Debasement, decline, and elimination of the solidus ==

When the former money changer Michael IV the Paphlagonian (1034–41) assumed the imperial throne in 1034, he began the slow process of debasing both the &quot;tetarteron nomisma&quot; and the &quot;histamenon nomisma&quot;. The debasement was gradual at first, but then accelerated rapidly: about 21 carats (87.5% pure) during the reign of Constantine IX Monomachos (1042–1055), 18 carats (75%) under Constantine X Doukas (1059–1067), and 16 carats (66.7%) under Romanos IV Diogenes (1068–1071). After Romanos lost the disastrous Battle of Manzikert to the Turks, the empire&#x27;s ability to generate revenue deteriorated further and the solidus continued to be debased. The coin&#x27;s purity reached 14 carats (58%) under Michael VII Doukas (1071–1078), 8 carats (33%) under Nikephoros III Botaneiates (1078–1081) and 0 to 8 carats during the first eleven years of the reign of Alexios I Komnenos (1081–1118). Alexios reformed the coinage in 1092 and eliminated the solidus (&quot;histamenon nomisma&quot;) altogether. In its place he introduced a new gold coin called the &quot;hyperpyron nomisma&quot; at about 20.5k fine (85%). The weight, dimensions and purity of the &quot;hyperpyron nomisma&quot; remained stable until the Sack of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204. After that time the exiled Empire of Nicea continued to strike a debased &quot;hyperpyron nomisma&quot;. Michael VIII Palaiologos recaptured Constantinople in 1261, and under him the restored Byzantine Empire continued to strike the debased &quot;hyperpyron nomisma&quot; until the joint reign of John V Palaiologos and John VI (1347–1354), who struck the final Byzantine gold coins. After that time the &quot;hyperpyron nomisma&quot; continued as a unit of account, but it was no longer struck in gold.

== Mints across the empire ==
From the 4th to the 11th centuries, &quot;solidi&quot; were minted mostly at the Constantinople mint. However, certain branch mints were active producers of solidi. In the Roman Empire during the 4th century, Trier, Rome, Milan, and Ravenna were the main producers of gold coins in the West, while Constantinople, Antioch, Thessalonica, and Nicomedia struck gold coins in the East. The Germanic invasions of the early fifth century led to the closure of many provincial mints, and by 410 the only mints that struck gold solidi were Rome, Ravenna, Constantinople, and Thessalonica. The Fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 saw the end of official Roman coinage in the West, though Germanic successor kingdoms such as the Ostrogothic Kingdom and the Franks continued to strike imitative solidi, with the portrait and title of the emperor in Constantinople.

Justinian I&#x27;s reconquests in the Western Empire reopened several mints, which began to strike gold solidi. His reconquest of the Vandal Kingdom reopened the mint at Carthage, where a great number of solidi were struck. In the early seventh century, the mint at Carthage began to strike small &quot;globular&quot; solidi, about half the size of a normal solidus but much thicker. These &quot;globular&quot; solidi were only struck in Carthage, and the mint continued to produce great quantities of solidi until its conquest by the Arabs in 698. Justinian&#x27;s conquests also allowed for imperial mints to begin coining solidi in Italy, with the mints at Ravenna and Rome once again striking official Roman coins. Under Justinian, Antioch in Syria started to mint solidi again after a 150-year hiatus, and a few solidi were struck at Alexandria in Egypt, though these are very rare today.

The mint at Syracuse grew beginning in the mid-seventh century during the reign of Constans II, who briefly moved the empire&#x27;s capital to the city. During the 8th and 9th centuries, the Syracuse mint produced a large number of &quot;solidi&quot; that failed to meet the specifications of the coins produced by the imperial mint in Constantinople. The Syracuse &quot;solidi&quot; were generally lighter (about 3.8g) and only 19k fine (79% pure). 

Although imperial law forbade merchants from exporting solidi outside imperial territory, this was very loosely enforced, and many solidi have been found in Russia, Central Europe, Georgia, and Syria. In particular, it seems as if the light-weight solidi were meant for foreign trade. In the 7th century they became a desirable circulating currency in Arabian countries. Since the solidi circulating outside the empire were not used to pay taxes to the emperor, they did not get reminted, and the soft pure-gold coins quickly became worn.

Through the end of the 7th century, Arabian copies of solidi – dinars minted by the caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, who had access to supplies of gold from the upper Nile – began to circulate in areas outside the Byzantine Empire. These corresponded in weight to only , but matched the weight of the lightweight (20 &quot;siliquae&quot;) solidi that were circulating in those areas. The two coins circulated together in these areas for a time.The solidus was not marked with any face value throughout its seven-century manufacture and circulation. Fractions of the solidus known as &quot;semissis&quot; (half-solidi) and &quot;tremissis&quot; (one-third solidi) were also produced. The fractional gold coins were especially popular in the West where the economy had been significantly simplified and few purchases required a denomination so large as the solidus.

The word &quot;soldier&quot; is ultimately derived from &quot;solidus&quot;, referring to the solidi with which soldiers were paid.

== Impact on world currencies ==
In medieval Europe, where the only coin in circulation was the silver penny (&quot;denier&quot;), the solidus was used as a unit of account equal to 12 &quot;deniers&quot;. Variations on the word &quot;solidus&quot; in the local language gave rise to a number of currency units:

=== France ===

In the French language, which evolved directly from common or vulgar Latin over the centuries, &quot;solidus&quot; changed to &quot;soldus&quot;, then &quot;solt&quot;, then &quot;sol&quot; and finally &quot;sou&quot;. No gold &quot;solidi&quot; were minted after the Carolingians adopted the silver standard. Thenceforward, the &quot;solidus&quot; or &quot;sol&quot; was a paper accounting unit equivalent to one-twentieth of a pound (&quot;librum&quot; or &quot;livre&quot;) of silver and divided into 12 &quot;denarii&quot; or &quot;deniers&quot;. The monetary unit disappeared with decimalisation and introduction of the franc by the French First Republic during the French Revolution in 1795, but the coin of 5 centimes, a twentieth part of the franc, inherited the name &quot;sou&quot; as a nickname: in the first half of the 20th century, a coin or an amount of 5 francs was still often referred to as &quot;cent sous&quot;.

To this day, in French around the world, &quot;solde&quot; means the balance of an account or invoice, or sales (&quot;seasonal rebate&quot;), and is the specific name of a soldier&#x27;s salary. Although the &quot;sou&quot; as a coin disappeared more than two centuries ago, the word is still used as a synonym of money in many French phrases: &quot;avoir des sous&quot; is being rich, &quot;être sans un sou&quot; is being poor (same construction as &quot;penniless&quot;).

=== Quebec ===

In Canadian French, and are commonly employed terms for the Canadian cent. and are also regularly used. The European French is not used in Quebec. In Canada one hundredth of a dollar is officially known as a cent (pronounced /sɛnt/) in both English and French. However, in practice, a feminine form of , (pronounced /sɛn/) has mostly replaced the official &quot;&quot; outside bilingual areas. Spoken use of the official masculine form of cent is uncommon in francophone-only areas of Canada. Quarter dollar coins in colloquial Quebec French are sometimes called (thirty cents), because of a series of changes in terminology, currencies, and exchange rates. After the British conquest of Canada in 1759, French coins gradually fell out of use, and became a nickname for the halfpenny, which was similar in value to the French . Spanish pesos and U.S. dollars were also in use, and from 1841 to 1858 the exchange rate was fixed at $4 = £1 (or 400¢ = 240d). This made 25¢ equal to 15d, or 30 halfpence i.e. . In 1858, pounds, shillings, and pence were abolished in favour of dollars and cents, and the nickname began to be used for the 1¢ coin, but the term for a 25¢ coin has endured.
In the vernacular Quebec French and are also frequently used to refer to money in general, especially small amounts.

=== Italy ===
The name of the medieval Italian silver (plural ), coined since the 11th century, was derived from .

This word is still in common use today in Italy in its plural with the same meaning as the English equivalent &quot;money&quot;. The word , like the French mentioned above, means the balance of an account or invoice; the German is a loan word with the same meaning. It also means &quot;seasonal rebate&quot;.

=== Switzerland ===

In the Italian speaking regions, the word &quot;soldo&quot;, on top of its modern uses in Italian, is still currently used in its archaic meaning: the pay soldiers receive, this is also true in French speaking Switzerland, where Swiss soldiers will receive &quot;il soldo&quot; – &quot;la solde&quot;; and German speaking Switzerland, where it is &quot;der Sold&quot;.

In Italian the verb Soldare (Assoldare) means hiring, more often soldiers (Soldati) or mercenaries, deriving exactly from the use of the word as described above.

=== Spain and Peru, Portugal and Brazil ===

As with &quot;soldier&quot; in English, the Spanish and Portuguese equivalent is &quot;soldado&quot; (almost the same pronunciation). The name of the medieval Spanish &quot;sueldo&quot; and Portuguese &quot;soldo&quot; (which also means salary) were derived from &quot;solidus&quot;; the term &quot;sweldo&quot; in most Philippine languages (Tagalog, Cebuano, etc.) is derived from the Spanish.

The Spanish and Portuguese word &quot;saldo&quot;, like the French &quot;solde&quot;, means the balance of an account or invoice. It is also used in some other languages, such as German and Afrikaans.

Some have suggested that the Peruvian unit of currency, the &quot;sol&quot;, is derived from &quot;solidus&quot;, but the standard unit of Peruvian currency was the &quot;real&quot; until 1863. Throughout the Spanish world the dollar equivalent was 8 reales (&quot;pieces of eight&quot;), which circulated legally in the United States until 1857. In the US, the colloquial expression &quot;two bits&quot; for a quarter dollar, and the stock market currency &quot;real&quot; last used for accounting, traded in of a U.S. dollar until 2001, still echoes the legal usage in the US in the 19th century.

The Peruvian &quot;sol&quot; was introduced at a rate of 5.25 per British Pound, or just under four shillings (the legacy &quot;soldus&quot;). The term &quot;soles de oro&quot; was introduced in 1933, three years after Peru had actually abandoned the gold standard. In 1985 the Peruvian sol was replaced at one thousand to one by the &quot;inti&quot;, representing the sun god of the Incas. By 1991 it had to be replaced with a new &quot;sol&quot; at a million to one, after which it remained reasonably stable.

=== United Kingdom ===

King Offa of Mercia began minting silver pennies on the Carolingian system . As on the continent, English coinage was restricted for centuries to the penny, while the &quot;scilling&quot;, understood to be the value of a cow in Kent or a sheep elsewhere, was merely a unit of account equivalent to 12 pence. The Tudors minted the first shilling coins. Prior to decimalisation in the United Kingdom in 1971, the abbreviation &quot;s.&quot; (from &quot;solidus&quot;) was used to represent shillings, just as &quot;d.&quot; (&quot;denarius&quot;) and £ (&quot;libra&quot;) were used to represent pence and pounds respectively.

Under the influence of the old long S , the abbreviations &quot;£sd&quot; eventually developed into the use of a slash , which gave rise to that symbol&#x27;s ISO and Unicode name &quot;solidus&quot;.

=== Vietnam === 

The French term &quot;sou&quot; was borrowed into Vietnamese as the word &quot;xu&quot; (). The term is usually used to simply mean the word &quot;coin&quot; often in compound in the forms of &quot;đồng xu&quot; () or &quot;tiền xu&quot; (). The modern Vietnamese đồng is nominally divided into 100 &quot;xu&quot;.

<doc id="462823" wikidata="Q433148" url="?curid=462823" title="Christian Laettner">
<text>Christian Donald Laettner (, ; born August 17, 1969) is an American former professional basketball player. His college career for the Duke Blue Devils is widely regarded as one of the best in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) history. He was the star player on the back-to-back Duke National Championship teams of 1991 and 1992, and the NCAA player of the year in his senior year. He is particularly famous for his game-winning shot against Kentucky in the 1992 tournament and for the hatred he received from opposing fans.
Laettner was the only collegian selected for the 1992 United States men&#x27;s Olympic basketball team, dubbed the &quot;Dream Team&quot;, that won the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics. As a member of the &quot;Dream Team&quot;, Laettner is enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame, and FIBA Hall of Fame, while he is enshrined for his individual career in the College Basketball Hall of Fame. He was drafted third overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves, then played 13 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for six teams, being named as an All-Star in 1997.

==Early life==
Christian Laettner was born and raised in Angola, New York, near Buffalo and Niagara Falls, to a blue-collar Roman Catholic family. His father George, a newspaper press plant printer, was of Polish descent and his grandparents spoke Polish as their first language while his mother Bonnie was a teacher. Christian&#x27;s older brother Christopher was a strong influence, often bullying young Christian, which helped instill a stern competitive drive. Both boys also frequently worked as farm laborers to supplement their allowance.

Laettner attended the private Nichols School. Although he received a financial aid package that paid a substantial part of his tuition, his family had to sacrifice to send him there and he also did janitorial work at the school to defray some of the cost. During his career he scored over 2,000 points, breaking the school record set by teammate Ron Torgalski, and the team won two state titles and reached another semifinal. He was the second player from Western New York to reach 2,000 points, falling short of Curtis Aiken&#x27;s total of 2,162 set five years earlier. He was a much sought-after college recruit.

In 2009 as &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; celebrated 50 years of All-Western New York (WNY) basketball selections, Laettner, who was twice an All-WNY first team selection was named to the 1980s All-WNY first team along with Aiken, Gary Bossert, Keith Robinson and Ritchie Campbell He was a first team selection for the All-time All-WNY team along with Aiken, Paul Harris, Bob Lanier and Mel Montgomery.

==College career==

Laettner attended Duke University and played for the basketball team from 1988 to 1992 under coach Mike Krzyzewski. As the team&#x27;s star player his final two seasons, he led the Blue Devils to the first two national titles in school history. A four-year starter, he also contributed to their runner-up finish his sophomore year and Final Four appearance in his freshman year. Thus, in total, he played 23 out of a maximum possible 24 NCAA tournament games, winning 21; both are records.

For his career, Laettner averaged 16.6 points and 7.8 rebounds per game while making almost half of his three-pointers. He scored 21.5 points per game his senior season, garnering every major national player of the year award; Duke retired his No. 32 jersey later that year. His career is widely regarded as among the best in college history, and he is enshrined in the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame.

===NCAA tournament records===
*Most points scored: 407
*Most free throws made: 142
*Most free throw attempts: 167
*Most games won: 21
*Most games played: 23

===Clutch performances===
Laettner had several clutch performances in the NCAA tournament. His most famous was the 1992 regional final against Kentucky, which was foreshadowed by the 1990 regional final against UConn; in both games Duke trailed by one point with two seconds remaining in overtime before Laettner made a jumper as time expired. He also swished the game-winning free throws against undefeated and heavily favored UNLV in the 1991 semifinal, which avenged UNLV&#x27;s 30-point victory in the 1990 final. He then led Duke to its first championship, defeating Kansas in the final, and was selected as the tournament&#x27;s most outstanding player.

In the 1992 East Regional Final, a game many critics rate among the greatest in college basketball history, Laettner hit a game-winning, buzzer-beating turn-around jumper that has since become known as simply The Shot. Over the course of the game, he shot a perfect ten of ten field goals and ten of ten free throws for 31 points. He then finished his college career by leading Duke to its second consecutive national title. The following year ESPN awarded him both &quot;Outstanding Performance Under Pressure&quot; and &quot;College Basketball Play of the Year&quot; for the Kentucky game, also awarding him &quot;Outstanding College Basketball Performer of the Year&quot;.

The game-winning shot against Kentucky became a cultural icon, having been frequently televised in college basketball montages. Several companies have also featured it in their commercials. In 2006 &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot; ranked it the fifth most memorable moment in sports history.

===Widely reviled===
Laettner was widely reviled by opposing fans throughout his career, to the extent that more than 20 years after graduating from Duke, he was voted the most hated college basketball player in history in an ESPN online poll. This led to ESPN&#x27;s creation of the 30 for 30 documentary &quot;I Hate Christian Laettner&quot; that explored five factors that the filmmakers believe explain this widespread and persistent hatred: race, privilege, bullying, greatness, and physical appearance. He was particularly resented for stepping on the chest of Kentucky player Aminu Timberlake during the 1992 regional final, which the referees deemed a technical foul; Laettner expressed regret for his misconduct but believed that ejection would have been too harsh a consequence.

==Professional career==

Selected third overall in 1992 NBA draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves, Laettner played 13 years in the NBA, from 1992 to 2005, scoring 11,121 points and grabbing 5,806 rebounds. His first six seasons were his best, averaging 16.6 points and 7.9 rebounds per game while starting almost all of them. He also was selected to the All-Rookie First Team in 1993 and the All-Star Game in 1997 while with the Atlanta Hawks, having been traded to Atlanta in 1996 alongside Sean Rooks in exchange for Spud Webb and Andrew Lang. His time on the Hawks was his most successful NBA team experience, twice reaching the second round of the playoffs.

Despite his achievements, Laettner&#x27;s NBA career was characterized by relative transience. He played for six different teams, was traded six times, and never spent more than four full seasons anywhere. In 2004, he was suspended for several games for using marijuana.

==National team career==
As the national player of the year, Laettner was the only collegian selected for the prestigious &quot;Dream Team&quot; that won the 1992 Olympic gold medal in a dominant fashion. He averaged 4.8 points per game. The team is considered one of the greatest in sports history and was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame, FIBA Hall of Fame, and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

==Post-NBA basketball==
Laettner maintains a close friendship with Duke teammate Brian Davis. They have pursued several business ventures together, including real-estate development in Durham, a Major League Soccer team, and an unsuccessful attempt to purchase the Memphis Grizzlies. Some legal problems, primarily regarding unpaid debts, have also occurred. In 2010, Laettner was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a member of the 1992 Dream Team. Laettner is the only player of the team who hasn&#x27;t been inducted into the Hall of Fame individually.

Since 2011 he has operated numerous youth basketball training camps. He also played one season in a semi-pro league and briefly served as an assistant coach in the NBA Development League. For &quot;The Z Team&quot;, an Olympic Channel reality show that has former Olympic athletes help struggling sports teams, he worked with the Garinger High School boys basketball team for a week.

==Personal life==
Laettner lives in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, and is an avid muskellunge fisherman.

He is divorced with three children.

He has donated large sums to his alma maters.

<doc id="462826" wikidata="Q55021352" url="?curid=462826" title="Christian Leopold von Buch">
<text>Christian Leopold von Buch (26 April 1774 – 4 March 1853), usually cited as Leopold von Buch, was a German geologist and paleontologist born in Stolpe an der Oder (now a part of Angermünde, Brandenburg) and is remembered as one of the most important contributors to geology in the first half of the nineteenth century. His scientific interest was devoted to a broad spectrum of geological topics: volcanism, petrology, fossils, stratigraphy and mountain formation. His most remembered accomplishment is the scientific definition of the Jurassic system.

==Biography==

Buch studied with Alexander von Humboldt under Abraham Gottlob Werner at the mining school in Freiberg, Saxony. He afterwards completed his education at the universities of Halle and Göttingen.

===German and Italian explorations===
He began writing on geological topics early in life. His &quot;Versuch einer mineralogischen Beschreibung von Landeck&quot; (Breslau, 1797) was translated into French (Paris, 1805), and into English as &quot;Attempt at a Mineralogical Description of Landeck&quot; (Edinburgh, 1810). In 1802 he published &quot;Entwurf einer geognostischen Beschreibung von Schlesien&quot; (&quot;The Geognosy of Silesia&quot;), which became the first volume of his &quot;Geognostische Beobachtungen auf Reisen durch Deutschland und Italien&quot; (&quot;Geognistic Observations while Travelling through Germany and Italy&quot;, see below). He was at this time a zealous upholder of the Neptunian theory of Werner, with some modifications. In 1797, he met Humboldt at Salzburg, and with him explored the geological formations of Styria, and the adjoining Alps. In the spring of 1798, Buch extended his excursions into Italy, where his faith in the Neptunian theory was shaken. In his early works, he had advocated the aqueous origin of basaltic and other formations, but now he saw cause to abandon Werner&#x27;s theory, and to recognize the volcanic origin of the basalts.

He saw Vesuvius for the first time in 1799. Later, in 1805, he had the opportunity, along with Humboldt and Gay Lussac, of witnessing its actual eruption. It was a remarkable eruption, and supplied Buch with data for refuting many erroneous ideas then entertained regarding volcanoes. In 1802 he examined the extinct volcanoes of Auvergne in the south of France. The aspect of the Puy de Dôme, with its cone of trachyte and its strata of basaltic lava, induced him to abandon as untenable the doctrines of Werner on the formation of these rocks. The results of all these geological travels were given to the world in the two volumes of his &quot;Geognostische Beobachtungen&quot; (Berlin, 1802 and 1809).

===Scandinavian explorations===
In 1806, Buch proceeded to Scandinavia and spent two years in examining its physical constitution. This furnished the materials for his work entitled &quot;Reise durch Norwegen und Lappland&quot; (&quot;Travels in Norway and Lapland&quot;, Berlin, 1810). He made many important observations on the geography of plants, on climatology and on geology. He showed that many of the erratic blocks on the North German plains must have come from Scandinavia. He also established the fact that the whole of Sweden is slowly but continuously rising above the level of the sea from Frederikshald to Åbo.

===Canary Islands and the Atlantic===
In 1815 Buch visited the Canary Islands in company with Christen Smith, a Norwegian botanist. These volcanic isles furnished the starting point from which Buch commenced a regular course of study on the production and activity of volcanoes. This is attested by his standard work on the subject entitled &quot;Physical Description of the Canary Isles&quot; (1825). His observations convinced him that these and other islands of the Atlantic owed their existence to volcanic action of the most intense kind, whereas the groups of islands in the South Sea were the remains of a pre-existing continent. During his time in the Canary Islands, he visited the Las Cañadas Caldera on Tenerife and the Caldera de Taburiente on La Palma. When he published his memoirs and observations about his excursion, he introduced the Spanish word &quot;Caldera&quot; (meaning &quot;Bowl&quot;) into the geological and scientific vocabulary. After his return from the Canaries he visited the basaltic group of the Hebrides and the coasts of Scotland and Ireland.

Buch&#x27;s geological excursions, even in countries which he had repeatedly visited before, continued without interruption until a very advanced age: eight months before his death he visited the mountains of Auvergne, and on returning home he read a paper on the Jurassic formation before the Academy of Berlin. Humboldt, who had known him intimately for a period of more than sixty years, called him the greatest geologist of that period. Buch was unmarried and lived aloof from the world, entirely devoted to scientific pursuits. His excursions were always taken on foot, with a staff in his hand, and the large pockets of his overcoat filled with papers and geological instruments.

===Evolution===

In the third edition of his &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; published in 1861, Charles Darwin added a &quot;Historical Sketch&quot; giving due credit to naturalists who had preceded him in publishing the opinion that species undergo modification, and that the existing forms of life have descended by true generation from pre-existing forms. According to Darwin:

:The celebrated geologist and naturalist, Von Buch, in his excellent &#x27;Description physique des Isles Canaries&#x27; (1836, p. 147), clearly expresses his belief that varieties slowly become changed into permanent species, which are no longer capable of intercrossing.

Evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr has written that Buch was the first naturalist to suggest geographic speciation, in 1825.

== Memberships and honors ==
In 1825, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Buch was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849.

Recipient of the Pour le Mérite for Sciences and Arts.

Elected as the first foreign member of the Geological Society of London.

The German Geological Society (DGG) named its Leopold-von-Buch-Plakette after him.

== Works ==
Besides the works already mentioned, paleontology works by von Buch include:

*&quot;On the Ammonites&quot; (1832)
*&quot;On the Terebratulae&quot; (1834)
*&quot;On the Ceratites&quot; (1841)
*&quot;On the Cystidae&quot; (1845)

Other books include:

*&quot;Geological Map of Germany&quot; (42 sheets; 1832)
*&quot;Über den Jur in Deutschland&quot; (1839)

<text>Earl Erne, of Crom Castle in the County of Fermanagh, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1789 for John Creighton, 2nd Baron Erne, who had earlier represented Lifford (Parliament of Ireland constituency) in the Irish House of Commons. He had already been made Viscount Erne, of Crom Castle in the County of Fermanagh, in 1781, also in the Peerage of Ireland, and sat from 1800 to 1828 as an Irish representative peer in the British House of Lords. The title of Baron Erne, of Crom Castle in the County of Fermanagh, was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1768 for his father Abraham Creighton. The Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. On his death the titles passed to his nephew, the third Earl. He was an Irish Representative Peer from 1845 to 1885 and also served as Lord Lieutenant of County Fermanagh during the same period. In 1876 he was created Baron Fermanagh, of Lisnaskea in the County of Fermanagh, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This was to allow the Earls to sit in the House of Lords by right, rather than having to stand for election as Representative Peers. An earlier title of Baroness Fermanagh in the Peerage of Ireland was created for Mary Verney on 13 June 1792, but became extinct on her death on 15 November 1810.

Lord Erne also changed the spelling of the family surname from Creighton to Crichton. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl. He was a Conservative politician and served as a Lord of the Treasury in the second Conservative administration of Benjamin Disraeli. Like his father he was also Lord Lieutenant of County Fermanagh. His grandson, the fifth Earl, held minor office from 1936 to 1939 in the National Government led by Stanley Baldwin and later Neville Chamberlain. Lord Erne was killed in the Second World War. The 6th Earl (often known as Harry Erne), who succeeded in 1940, was the Lord Lieutenant of County Fermanagh from 1986 until 2012. On his death in 2015, he was succeeded by his only son, the 7th Earl. 

The 3rd Earl is also remembered as the employer of Captain Charles Boycott, whose mishandling of relations with agricultural workers on Lord Erne&#x27;s estate in County Mayo caused a political and public order crisis and provoked the strategy that gave the English language the term &quot;to boycott&quot;. 

The invented title of &quot;Viscount Crichton&quot; is used as a courtesy title for the Earl&#x27;s heir apparent.

The family seat is Crom Castle, near Newtownbutler, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland.

Styled formally as Viscount Crichton from birth, he was educated at Sunningdale School, Shiplake College, Henley-on-Thames, and at L&#x27;Institut de Touraine, in Tours, France.

On 23 December 2015, he succeeded his father as Earl Erne of Crom Castle (I., 1789), Viscount Erne of Crom Castle (I., 1781), Baron Erne of Crom Castle (I., 1768), and as the Baron Fermanagh of Lisnaskea (U.K., 1876).

On 4 May 2019, at Holy Trinity Church, Crom, County Fermanagh, near Crom Castle, the family seat which he still owns, Erne was married to Harriet Elizabeth Patterson, daughter of Alan James Patterson, by Ferran Glenfield, Church of Ireland Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh.

The heir presumptive is the present holder&#x27;s second cousin once removed, Charles David Blayney Crichton (born 1953), who has a son, Oliver Charles Martin Crichton (born 1995).

<text>Juanita Craft (born Juanita Jewel Shanks; February 9, 1902 – August 6, 1985) was an American activist and politician. Craft was an activist in the civil rights movement and also served as a member of the Dallas City Council in Texas.

==Biography==
Born in Round Rock, Texas, Craft was the only child of schoolteachers David Sylvestus (d. 1947) and Eliza Balfour Shanks (d. 1918). Craft was raised by her mother until she died in 1918. After her mother&#x27;s death, Craft moved to Columbus, Texas to be with her father. After graduating high school in 1919, Craft attended Prairie View A&amp;M University where she studied sewing and millinery. After two years at Prairie View, Craft moved back to Austin, Texas and received her teaching certificate from Samuel Huston College. By 1925, Craft was working as a maid at the Adolphus Hotel and later as a seamstress.

Craft joined the NAACP in 1935, eventually becoming the Dallas NAACP membership chairman in 1942 and the Texas NAACP field organizer in 1946. 
She helped to organize 182 branches of the NAACP over eleven years. In 1944, Craft became the first black woman in Dallas County to vote in a public election. In 1955, she organized a protest of the State Fair of Texas against its policy of admitting blacks only on &quot;Negro Achievement Day.&quot; Craft also assisted in the organization of protests and pickets in segregated lunch counters, restaurants, theaters and public transportation.

Following the 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, Craft worked to integrate the University of Texas Law School and the Dallas Independent School District. She attempted to help enroll the first black student at North Texas State College (Now the University of North Texas), a battle eventually won through litigation 
She later served two terms on the Dallas City Council from 1975 and 1979. Craft became a towering historic figure in the Civil Rights Movement in Texas, and was given many awards for her efforts, including the NAACP Golden Heritage Life Membership Award in 1978, the Eleanor Roosevelt Humanitarian Award in 1984, and she was recognized by the NAACP for her fifty years of service shortly before her death at the age of 83 on August 6, 1985.

==Legacy==
The Juanita Jewel Craft Recreation Center and a Dallas city park were named in her honor as was a U.S. Post Office in southeast Dallas. Craft home on Warren Avenue in South Dallas is now the Juanita J. Craft Civil Rights House and is part of Dallas&#x27;s Wheatley Place Historic District. 
Climbing the wooden steps of its front porch were many historic figures seeking audience with Juanita Craft, including Martin Luther King, Jr., and President Lyndon B. Johnson.

==Personal and awards==
Craft was married twice, first to a childhood friend Charles Floyd Langham from 1921 to 1925. Craft&#x27;s second marriage was to salesman and gambler Johnnie Edward Craft from 1937 until his death in 1950.

<doc id="462836" wikidata="Q5060415" url="?curid=462836" title="Colombo Central Bank bombing">
<text>The Central Bank bombing was one of the deadliest attacks carried out by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) during the separatist civil war in Sri Lanka between the government and the Tamil Tigers.

==Incident==
The attack took place on 31 January 1996, in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo. A lorry containing about 440 pounds of high explosives crashed through the main gate of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, a seaside high-rise which managed most of the financial business of the country. As gunmen traded fire with security guards, a suicide bomber in the lorry detonated the massive bomb, which tore through the bank and damaged eight other buildings nearby. The lorry was followed by a three-wheeler, carrying two LTTE cadres armed with automatic rifles and an RPG launcher.

The blast killed at least 91 people and injured 1,400 others. 
At least 100 people lost their eyesight. Among the wounded were two US citizens, six Japanese, and one Dutch national. Most of these were bystanders or civilians manning small shops set up near the bank. While the bomber Raju died immediately, the backup team Subramanium Vigneswaram alias Kittu, and Sivasamy Dharmendra alias Raju, were apprehended by law enforcement with information provided by the public. Police and the security forces launched a massive manhunt for others who were involved in this terrorist incident. It was eventually determined the bombers had come from Jaffna, in the north of the country and were LTTE members.

This bombing, and one in July on a train that killed more than 70, caused tourism to plummet 40% in Sri Lanka. Until 2006, the Central Bank bombing was the deadliest LTTE bombing of the civil war.

The BBC reported that the Tigers denied responsibility for the attack. But the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ravinatha Aryasinha, blamed the Tigers, saying the attack proved they &quot;do not care for international opinion or the safety of civilians, including foreigners who have nothing to do with the present conflict&quot;.

== Suicide bombers ==
The attack was mainly carried out by three LTTE cadres. While one of them died immediately, the other two were taken into custody by the police. The suicide bombers were:
*Raju (main bomber)
*Subramanium Vigneswaram alias Kittu
*Sivasamy Dharmendra alias Raju

Immediately after the bombing, several tourists and local and foreign travel agencies received calls from Ellalan Force, a front organisation of LTTE, to boycott Sri Lanka.

== Criminal indictment ==
Eleven LTTE members were charged with the bombing of the Central Bank, ten of them were indicted on a total of 712 counts, including intention to cause death and committing murder, destruction of state property by attacking the central bank, and provoking violence.

In 2002, Judge Sarath Ambepitiya issued an open warrant to arrest LTTE&#x27;s exclusive leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran in connection with the 1996 Central Bank Bombing. The judge found him guilty, in absentia, on 51 counts and sentenced him to 200 years in prison.

<doc id="462839" wikidata="Q817862" url="?curid=462839" title="Conditional (computer programming)">
<text>In computer science, conditionals (that is, conditional statements, conditional expressions and conditional constructs) are programming language constructs that perform different computations or actions or return different values depending on the value of a Boolean expression, called a &quot;condition&quot;.

Conditionals are typically implemented by selectively executing instructions. Although dynamic dispatch is not usually classified as a conditional construct, it is another way to select between alternatives at runtime.

== Terminology ==
Conditional statements are imperative constructs executed for side-effect, while conditional expressions return values. Many programming languages (such as C) have distinct conditional statements and conditional expressions. Although in pure functional programming, conditional expressions do not have side-effects, many languages with conditional expressions (such as Lisp) support conditional side-effects.

== If–then(–else) ==

The codice_1 or codice_2 construction is used in many programming languages. Although the syntax varies from language to language, the basic structure (in pseudocode form) looks like this:

 If (Boolean condition) Then
 (consequent)
 Else
 (alternative)
 End If

For example:

 If stock=0 Then
 message= order new stock
 Else
 message= there is stock
 End If

In the example code above, the part represented by &quot;(Boolean condition)&quot; constitutes a conditional &quot;expression&quot;, having intrinsic value (e.g., it may be substituted by either of the values codice_3 or codice_4) but having no intrinsic meaning. In contrast, the combination of this expression, the codice_5 and codice_6 surrounding it, and the consequent that follows afterward constitute a conditional &quot;statement&quot;, having intrinsic meaning (e.g., expressing a coherent logical rule) but no intrinsic value.

When an interpreter finds an codice_5, it expects a Boolean condition – for example, codice_8, which means &quot;the variable x contains a number that is greater than zero&quot; – and evaluates that condition. If the condition is codice_9, the statements following the codice_10 are executed. Otherwise, the execution continues in the following branch – either in the codice_11 block (which is usually optional), or if there is no codice_11 branch, then after the codice_13.

After either branch has been executed, control returns to the point after the codice_13.

=== History and development ===
In early programming languages, especially some dialects of BASIC in the 1980s home computers, an codice_1 statement could only contain codice_16 statements (equivalent to a branch instruction). This led to a hard-to-read style of programming known as spaghetti programming, with programs in this style called &quot;spaghetti code&quot;. As a result, structured programming, which allows (virtually) arbitrary statements to be put in statement blocks inside an codice_17 statement, gained in popularity, until it became the norm even in most BASIC programming circles. Such mechanisms and principles were based on the older but more advanced ALGOL family of languages, and ALGOL-like languages such as Pascal and Modula-2 influenced modern BASIC variants for many years. While it is possible while using only codice_18 statements in codice_1 statements to write programs that are not spaghetti code and are just as well structured and readable as programs written in a structured programming language, structured programming makes this easier and enforces it. Structured codice_2 statements like the example above are one of the key elements of structured programming, and they are present in most popular high-level programming languages such as C, Java, JavaScript and Visual Basic .

==== The &quot;dangling else&quot; problem ====

The codice_11 keyword is made to target a specific codice_1 statement preceding it, but for nested codice_1 statements, classic programming languages such as ALGOL 60 struggled to define which specific statement to target. Without clear boundaries for which statement is which, an codice_11 keyword could target any preceding codice_1 statement in the nest, as parsed.
 if a then if b then s else s2
can be parsed as
 if a then (if b then s) else s2
or
 if a then (if b then s else s2)
depending on whether the codice_11 is associated with the first codice_17 or second codice_17. This is known as the dangling else problem, and is resolved in various ways, depending on the language (commonly via the codice_29 statement or codice_30 brackets).

=== Else if===

By using codice_31, it is possible to combine several conditions. Only the statements following the first condition that is found to be true will be executed. All other statements will be skipped.

 if condition then
 &quot;-- statements&quot;
 elseif condition then
 &quot;-- more statements&quot;
 elseif condition then
 &quot;-- more statements;&quot;
 else
 &quot;-- other statements;&quot;
 end if;

For example, for a shop offering as much as a 30% discount for an item:

 if discount &lt; 11% then
 print (you have to pay $30)
 elseif discount&lt;21% then
 print (you have to pay $20)
 elseif discount&lt;31% then
 print (you have to pay $10)
 end if;

In the example above, if the discount is 10%, then the first if statement will be evaluated as true and &quot;you have to pay $30&quot; will be printed out. All other statements below that first if statement will be skipped.

The codice_32 statement, in the Ada language for example, is simply syntactic sugar for codice_11 followed by codice_17. In Ada, the difference is that only one codice_29 is needed, if one uses codice_32 instead of codice_11 followed by codice_17. PHP uses the codice_32 keyword both for its curly brackets or colon syntaxes. Perl provides the keyword codice_40 to avoid the large number of braces that would be required by multiple codice_17 and codice_11 statements. Python uses the special keyword codice_43 because structure is denoted by indentation rather than braces, so a repeated use of codice_11 and codice_17 would require increased indentation after every condition. Some implementations of BASIC, such as Visual Basic, use codice_46 too. Similarly, the earlier UNIX shells (later gathered up to the POSIX shell syntax) use elif too, but giving the choice of delimiting with spaces, line breaks, or both.

However, in many languages more directly descended from Algol, such as Simula, Pascal, BCPL and C, this special syntax for the codice_31 construct is not present, nor is it present in the many syntactical derivatives of C, such as Java, ECMAScript, and so on. This works because in these languages, any &quot;single&quot; statement (in this case codice_48...) can follow a conditional without being enclosed in a block.

This design choice has a slight &quot;cost&quot;. Each codice_31 branch effectively adds an extra nesting level. This complicates the job for the compiler (or the people who write the compiler), because the compiler must analyse and implement arbitrarily long codice_31 chains recursively.

If all terms in the sequence of conditionals are testing the value of a single expression (e.g., codice_51 ... codice_52 ... codice_53...), an alternative is the switch statement, also called case-statement or select-statement. Conversely, in languages that do not have a switch statement, these can be produced by a sequence of codice_31 statements.

===If–then–else expressions===

Many languages support &quot;conditional expressions&quot;, which are similar to if statements, but return a value as a result. Thus, they are true expressions (which evaluate to a value), not statements (which may not be permitted in the context of a value). The concept of conditional expressions was first developed by John McCarthy during his research into symbolic processing and LISP in the late 1950s.

====Algol family====
ALGOL 60 and some other members of the ALGOL family allow codice_2 as an expression. The idea of including conditional expressions was suggested by John McCarthy, though the ALGOL committee decided to use English words rather than McCarthy&#x27;s mathematical syntax:

====Lisp dialects====
Conditional expressions have always been a fundamental part of Lisp. In pure LISP, the codice_56 function is used. In dialects such as Scheme, Racket and Common Lisp:

;; Scheme
(define (myvariable x) (if (&gt; x 12) 1 2)) ; Assigns &#x27;myvariable&#x27; to 1 or 2, depending on the value of &#x27;x&#x27;

;; Common Lisp
(let ((x 10))
 (setq myvariable (if (&gt; x 12) 2 4))) ; Assigns &#x27;myvariable&#x27; to 2


====Haskell====
In Haskell 98, there is only an &quot;if expression&quot;, no &quot;if statement&quot;, and the codice_11 part is compulsory, as every expression must have some value. Logic that would be expressed with conditionals in other languages is usually expressed with pattern matching in recursive functions.

Because Haskell is lazy, it is possible to write control structures, such as &quot;if&quot;, as ordinary expressions; the lazy evaluation means that an &quot;if function&quot; can evaluate only the condition and proper branch (where a strict language would evaluate all three). It can be written like this:

if&#x27; :: Bool -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
if&#x27; True x _ = x
if&#x27; False _ y = y
====C-like languages====
C and C-like languages have a special ternary operator (?:) for conditional expressions with a function that may be described by a template like this:
 codice_58
This means that it can be inlined into expressions, unlike if-statements, in C-like languages:

my_variable = x &gt; 10 ? &quot;foo&quot; : &quot;bar&quot;; // In C-like languages

which can be compared to the Algol-family if–then–else &quot;expressions&quot; (in contrast to a &quot;statement&quot;) (and similar in Ruby and Scala, among others).

To accomplish the same using an if-statement, this would take more than one line of code (under typical layout conventions), and require mentioning &quot;my_variable&quot; twice:

if (x &gt; 10)
 my_variable = &quot;foo&quot;;
else
 my_variable = &quot;bar&quot;;
Some argue that the explicit if/then statement is easier to read and that it may compile to more efficient code than the ternary operator, while others argue that concise expressions are easier to read than statements spread over several lines containing repetition.

====Small Basic====

x = TextWindow.ReadNumber()
If (x &gt; 10) Then
 TextWindow.WriteLine(&quot;My variable is named &#x27;foo&#x27;.&quot;)
Else
 TextWindow.WriteLine(&quot;My variable is named &#x27;bar&#x27;.&quot;)
EndIf
First, when the user runs the program, a cursor appears waiting for the reader to type a number. If that number is greater than 10, the text &quot;My variable is named &#x27;foo&#x27;.&quot; is displayed on the screen. If the number is smaller than 10, then the message &quot;My variable is named &#x27;bar&#x27;.&quot; is printed on the screen.

====Visual Basic====

In Visual Basic and some other languages, a function called codice_59 is provided, which can be used as a conditional expression. However, it does not behave like a true conditional expression, because both the true and false branches are always evaluated; it is just that the result of one of them is thrown away, while the result of the other is returned by the IIf function.

====Tcl====

In Tcl codice_17 is not a keyword but a function (in Tcl known as command or codice_61). For example

if {$x &gt; 10} {
 puts &quot;Foo!&quot;

invokes a function named codice_17 passing 2 arguments: The first one being the condition and the second one being the true branch. Both arguments are passed as strings (in Tcl everything within curly brackets is a string).

In the above example the condition is not evaluated before calling the function. Instead, the implementation of the codice_17 function receives the condition as a string value and is responsible to evaluate this string as an expression in the callers scope.

Such a behavior is possible by using codice_64 and codice_65 commands:
:Uplevel makes it possible to implement new control constructs as Tcl procedures (for example, uplevel could be used to implement the while construct as a Tcl procedure).

Because codice_17 is actually a function it also returns a value:
:The return value from the command is the result of the body script that was executed, or an empty string if none of the expressions was non-zero and there was no bodyN.

====Rust====
In Rust, codice_17 is always an expression. It evaluates to the value of whichever branch is executed, or to the unit type codice_68 if no branch is executed. If a branch does not provide a return value, it evaluates to codice_68 by default. To ensure the codice_17 expression&#x27;s type is known at compile time, each branch must evaluate to a value of the same type. For this reason, an codice_11 branch is effectively compulsory unless the other branches evaluate to codice_68, because an codice_17 without an codice_11 can always evaluate to codice_68 by default.
// Assign my_variable some value, depending on the value of x
let my_variable = if x &gt; 20 {
 1
} else {
 2

// This variant will not compile because 1 and () have different types
let my_variable = if x &gt; 20 {
 1

// Values can be omitted when not needed
if x &gt; 20 {
 println!(&quot;x is greater than 20&quot;);


===Guarded conditionals===

The Guarded Command Language (GCL) of Edsger Dijkstra supports conditional execution as a list of commands consisting of a Boolean-valued guard (corresponding to a &quot;condition&quot;) and its corresponding statement. In GCL, exactly one of the statements whose guards is true is evaluated, but which one is arbitrary. In this code
 if G0 → S0
 □ G1 → S1
 □ Gn → Sn
 fi
the G&quot;i&quot;&#x27;s are the guards and the S&quot;i&quot;&#x27;s are the statements. If none of the guards is true, the program&#x27;s behavior is undefined.

GCL is intended primarily for reasoning about programs, but similar notations have been implemented in Concurrent Pascal and occam.

=== Arithmetic if ===
Up to Fortran 77, the language Fortran has had an arithmetic &quot;if&quot; statement which jumps to one of three labels depending on whether its argument &quot;e&quot; is This was the earliest conditional statement in Fortran.

==== Syntax ====

IF (e) label1, label2, label3
Where e is any numeric expression (not necessarily an integer).

==== Semantics ====
This is equivalent to this sequence, where &quot;e&quot; is evaluated only once.

IF (e .LT. 0) GOTO label1
IF (e .EQ. 0) GOTO label2
IF (e .GT. 0) GOTO label3
==== Stylistics ====
Arithmetic &quot;if&quot; is an unstructured control statement, and is not used in structured programming.

In practice it has been observed that most arithmetic codice_76 statements reference the following statement with one or two of the labels.

This was the only conditional control statement in the original implementation of Fortran on the IBM 704 computer. On that computer the test-and-branch op-code had three addresses for those three states. Other computers would have &quot;flag&quot; registers such as positive, zero, negative, even, overflow, carry, associated with the last arithmetic operations and would use instructions such as &#x27;Branch if accumulator negative&#x27; then &#x27;Branch if accumulator zero&#x27; or similar. Note that the expression is evaluated &quot;once only&quot;, and in cases such as integer arithmetic where overflow may occur, the overflow or carry flags would be considered also.

=== Object-oriented implementation in Smalltalk ===

In contrast to other languages, in Smalltalk the conditional statement is not a language construct but defined in the class codice_77 as an abstract method that takes two parameters, both closures. codice_77 has two subclasses, codice_3 and codice_4, which both define the method, codice_3 executing the first closure only, codice_4 executing the second closure only.
var = condition 
 ifTrue: [ &#x27;foo&#x27; ]
 ifFalse: [ &#x27;bar&#x27; ]
=== JavaScript ===
JavaScript uses if-else statements similar to those in C languages. A Boolean value is accepted within parentheses between the reserved &quot;if&quot; keyword and a left curly bracket.

if (Math.random() &lt; 0.5) {
 console.log(&quot;You got Heads!&quot;);
} else {
 console.log(&quot;You got Tails!&quot;);

The above example takes the conditional of codice_83 which outputs codice_9 if a random float value between 0 and 1 is greater than 0.5. The statement uses it to randomly choose between outputting codice_85 or codice_86 to the console. Else and else-if statements can also be chained after the curly bracket of the statement preceding it as many times as necessary, as shown below:

var x = Math.random();
if (x &lt; 1/3) {
 console.log(&quot;One person won!&quot;);
} else if (x &lt; 2/3) {
 console.log(&quot;Two people won!&quot;);
} else {
 console.log(&quot;It&#x27;s a three-way tie!&quot;);


=== Lambda calculus ===
In Lambda calculus, the concept of an if-then-else conditional can be expressed using the following expressions:
 true = λx. λy. x
 false = λx. λy. y
 ifThenElse = (λc. λx. λy. (c x y))
# true takes up to two arguments and once both are provided (see currying), it returns the first argument given. 
# false takes up to two arguments and once both are provided(see currying), it returns the second argument given.
# ifThenElse takes up to three arguments and once all are provided, it passes both second and third argument to the first argument(which is a function that given two arguments, and produces a result). We expect ifThenElse to only take true or false as an argument, both of which project the given two arguments to their preferred single argument, which is then returned. 
note: if ifThenElse is passed two functions as the left and right conditionals; it is necessary to also pass an empty tuple () to the result of ifThenElse in order to actually call the chosen function, otherwise ifThenElse will just return the function object without getting called.

In a system where numbers can be used without definition (like Lisp, Traditional paper math, so on), the above can be expressed as a single closure below:

 ((λtrue. λfalse. λifThenElse.
 (ifThenElse true 2 3)
 )(λx. λy. x)(λx. λy. y)(λc. λl. λr. c l r))

Here, true, false, and ifThenElse are bound to their respective definitions which are passed to their scope at the end of their block.

A working JavaScript analogy(using only functions of single variable for rigor) to this is as follows:

 var computationResult = ((_true =&gt; _false =&gt; _ifThenElse =&gt; 
 _ifThenElse(_true)(2)(3) 
 )(x =&gt; y =&gt; x)(x =&gt; y =&gt; y)(c =&gt; x =&gt; y =&gt; c(x)(y)));

The code above with multivariable functions looks like this:

 var computationResult = ((_true, _false, _ifThenElse) =&gt;
 _ifThenElse(_true, 2, 3)
 )((x, y) =&gt; x, (x, y) =&gt; y, (c, x, y) =&gt; c(x, y));

Another version of the earlier example without a system where numbers are assumed is below.

The first example shows the first branch being taken, while second example shows the second branch being taken.

 ((λtrue. λfalse. λifThenElse.
 (ifThenElse true (λFirstBranch. FirstBranch) (λSecondBranch. SecondBranch))
 )(λx. λy. x)(λx. λy. y)(λc. λl. λr. c l r))

 ((λtrue. λfalse. λifThenElse.
 (ifThenElse false (λFirstBranch. FirstBranch) (λSecondBranch. SecondBranch))
 )(λx. λy. x)(λx. λy. y)(λc. λl. λr. c l r))

Smalltalk uses a similar idea for its true and false representations, with True and False being singleton objects that respond to messages ifTrue/ifFalse differently.

Haskell used to use this exact model for its Boolean type, but at the time of writing, most Haskell programs use syntactic sugar &quot;if a then b else c&quot; construct which unlike ifThenElse does not compose unless
either wrapped in another function or re-implemented as shown in The Haskell section of this page.

== Case and switch statements ==

Switch statements (in some languages, &quot;case statements&quot; or multiway branches) compare a given value with specified constants and take action according to the first constant to match. There is usually a provision for a default action (&#x27;else&#x27;,&#x27;otherwise&#x27;) to be taken if no match succeeds. Switch statements can allow compiler optimizations, such as lookup tables. In dynamic languages, the cases may not be limited to constant expressions, and might extend to pattern matching, as in the shell script example on the right, where the &#x27;*)&#x27; implements the default case as a regular expression matching any string.

== Pattern matching ==

Pattern matching may be seen as an alternative to both &quot;if–then–else&quot;, and &quot;case&quot; statements. It is available in many programming languages with functional programming features, such as Wolfram Language, ML and many others. Here is a simple example written in the OCaml language:

match fruit with
| &quot;apple&quot; -&gt; cook pie
| &quot;coconut&quot; -&gt; cook dango_mochi
| &quot;banana&quot; -&gt; mix;;

The power of pattern matching is the ability to &quot;concisely&quot; match not only actions but also &quot;values&quot; to patterns of data. Here is an example written in Haskell which illustrates both of these features:

map _ [] = []
map f (h : t) = f h : map f t

This code defines a function &quot;map&quot;, which applies the first argument (a function) to each of the elements of the second argument (a list), and returns the resulting list. The two lines are the two definitions of the function for the two kinds of arguments possible in this case – one where the list is empty (just return an empty list) and the other case where the list is not empty.

Pattern matching is not strictly speaking &quot;always&quot; a choice construct, because it is possible in Haskell to write only one alternative, which is guaranteed to always be matched – in this situation, it is not being used as a choice construct, but simply as a way to bind names to values. However, it is frequently used as a choice construct in the languages in which it is available.

== Hash-based conditionals ==
In programming languages that have associative arrays or comparable data structures, such as Python, Perl, PHP or Objective-C, it is idiomatic to use them to implement conditional assignment.
pet = input(&quot;Enter the type of pet you want to name: &quot;)
known_pets = {
 &quot;Dog&quot;: &quot;Fido&quot;,
 &quot;Cat&quot;: &quot;Meowsles&quot;,
 &quot;Bird&quot;: &quot;Tweety&quot;,
my_name = known_pets[pet]
In languages that have anonymous functions or that allow a programmer to assign a named function to a variable reference, conditional flow can be implemented by using a hash as a dispatch table.

==Predication==

An alternative to conditional branch instructions is predication. Predication is an architectural feature that enables instructions to be conditionally executed instead of modifying the control flow.

== Choice system cross reference ==

This table refers to the most recent language specification of each language. For languages that do not have a specification, the latest officially released implementation is referred to.

<text>A Chinese wall or ethical wall is an information barrier protocol within an organization designed to prevent exchange of information or communication that could lead to conflicts of interest. For example, a Chinese wall may be established to separate people who make investments from those who are privy to confidential information that could improperly influence the investment decisions. Firms are generally required by law to safeguard insider information and ensure that improper trading does not occur.

== Etymology ==

Bryan Garner&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage&quot; states that the metaphor title &quot;derives &quot;of course&quot; from the Great Wall of China&quot;, although an alternative explanation links the idea to the screen walls of Chinese internal architecture.

The term was popularized in the United States following the stock market crash of 1929, when the U.S. government legislated information separation between investment bankers and brokerage firms, in order to limit the conflict of interest between objective company analysis and the desire for successful initial public offerings. Rather than prohibiting one company from engaging in both businesses, the government permitted the implementation of Chinese-wall procedures.

A leading note on the subject published in 1980 in the &quot;University of Pennsylvania Law Review&quot; titled &quot;The Chinese Wall Defense to Law-Firm Disqualification&quot; perpetuated the use of the term.

===Objections to the term &quot;Chinese wall&quot;===
There have been disputes about the use of the term for some decades, particularly in the legal and banking sectors. The term can be seen both as culturally insensitive and an inappropriate reflection on Chinese culture and trade, which are now extensively integrated into the global market.

In &quot;Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. v. Superior Court&quot; (1988), Presiding Justice Harry W. Low, a Chinese American, wrote a concurring opinion specifically in order &quot;to express my profound objection to the use of this phrase in this context&quot;. He called the term a &quot;piece of legal flotsam which should be emphatically abandoned&quot;, and suggested &quot;ethics wall&quot; as a more suitable alternative. He maintained that the &quot;continued use of the term would be insensitive to the ethnic identity of the many persons of Chinese descent&quot;.

===Alternative terms===
Alternative phrases include &quot;screen&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;cone of silence&quot;, and &quot;ethical wall&quot;.

&quot;Screen&quot;, or the verb &quot;to screen&quot;, is the preferred term of the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct. The ABA Model Rules define &quot;screening&quot; as &quot;the isolation of a lawyer from any participation in a matter through the timely imposition of procedures within a firm that are reasonably adequate under the circumstances to protect information that the isolated lawyer is obligated to protect under these Rules or other law&quot;, and suitable &quot;screening procedures&quot; have been approved where paralegals have moved from one law firm to another and have worked on cases for their former employer which may conflict with the interests of their current employer and the clients they represent.

==Usage in specific industries==

===Finance===
A Chinese wall is commonly employed in investment banks, between the corporate-advisory area and the brokering department. This separates those giving corporate advice on takeovers from those advising clients about buying shares and researching the equities themselves.

The &quot;wall&quot; is thrown up to prevent leaks of corporate inside information, which could influence the advice given to clients making investments, and allow staff to take advantage of facts that are not yet known to the general public.

The phrase &quot;over the wall&quot; is used by equity research personnel to refer to rank-and-file personnel who operate without an ethics wall at all times. Examples include members of the Chinese wall department, most compliance personnel, attorneys and certain NYSE-licensed analysts. The term &quot;already over the wall&quot; is used when an employee who is not normally privy to wall-guarded information somehow obtains sensitive information. Breaches considered semi-accidental were typically not met with punitive action during the heyday of the &quot;dot-com&quot; era. These and other instances involving conflicts of interest were rampant during this era. A major scandal was exposed when it was discovered that research analysts were encouraged to blatantly publish dishonest positive analyses on companies in which they, or related parties, owned shares, or on companies that depended on the investment banking departments of the same research firms. The U.S. government has since passed laws strengthening the use ethics walls such as Title V of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act in order to prevent such conflicts of interest.

Ethics walls are also used in the corporate finance departments of the &quot;Big Four&quot; and other large accountancy and financial services firms. They are designed to insulate sensitive documentation from the wider firm in order to prevent conflicts.

===Journalism===
The term is used in journalism to describe the separation between the editorial and advertising arms. The Chinese wall is regarded as breached for &quot;advertorial&quot; projects. In student journalism, maintaining a publication&#x27;s independence from its associated educational institution can be a challenge.

Separately, the term can refer to a separation between a publication&#x27;s news and opinions arms.

===Insurance===
The term is used in property and casualty insurance to describe the separation of claim handling where both parties to a claim (e.g. an airport and an airline) have insurance policies with the same insurer. The claim handling process needs to be segregated within the organisation to avoid a conflict of interest.

This also occurs when there is an unidentified or uninsured motorist involved in an auto collision. In this case, two loss adjusters will take on the claim - one representing the insured party and another representing the uninsured or unidentified motorist. While they both represent the same policy, they both must investigate and negotiate to determine fault and what if anything is covered under the policy. In this case, a Chinese wall is erected between the two adjusters.

===Law===
Chinese walls may be used in law firms to address a conflict of interest, for example to separate one part of the firm representing a party on a deal or litigation from another part of the firm with contrary interests or with confidential information from an adverse party. Under UK law, a firm may represent competing parties in a suit, but only in strictly defined situations and when individual fee earners do not act for both sides. In United States law firms, the use of Chinese walls is no longer sufficient on its own to eliminate or &quot;cure&quot; a potential conflict of interest except within very narrow exceptions. They are, however, still used in conjunction with requests from clients as a condition of waivers, or as a prudential measure within the firm to prevent or address potential business issues. The American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct (2004) state: &quot;While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7 or 1.9, unless the prohibition is based on a personal interest of the prohibited lawyer and does not present a significant risk of materially limiting the representation of the client by the remaining lawyers in the firm.&quot; Although ABA rules are only advisory, most U.S. states have adopted them or have even stricter regulations in place.

===Government procurement===
Chinese or ethical walls may be required where a company which already has a contract with a public body intends to bid for a new contract, in circumstances where the public body concerned wishes to maintain a fair competitive procedure and avoid or minimise the advantage which the existing contractor may have over other potential bidders. In some cases UK public sector terms of contract require the establishment of &quot;ethical wall arrangements&quot; approved by the customer as a pre-condition for involvement in the procurement process for additional goods and services or for a successor contract.

===Computer science===

In computer science, the concept of a Chinese wall is used by both the operating system for computer security and the US judicial system for protection against copyright infringement. In computer security it concerns the software stability of the operating system. The same concept is involved in an important business matter concerning the &quot;licensing&quot; of each of a computer&#x27;s many software and hardware components.

Any hardware component that requires direct software interaction will have a license for itself and a license for its software &quot;driver&quot; running in the operating system. Reverse engineering software is a part of computer science that can involve writing a driver for a piece of hardware in order to enable it to work in an operating system unsupported by the manufacturer of the hardware, or to add functionality or increase the performance of its operations (not provided by the manufacturer) in the supported operating system, or to restore the usage of a piece of computer hardware for which the driver has disappeared altogether. A reverse engineered driver offers access to development, by persons outside the company that manufactured it, of the general hardware usage.

====Reverse engineering====
There is a case-law mechanism called &quot;clean room design&quot; that is employed to avoid copyright infringement when reverse engineering a proprietary driver.

It involves two separate engineering groups separated by a Chinese wall. One group works with the hardware to reverse engineer what must be the original algorithms and only documents their findings. The other group writes the code, based only on that documentation. Once the new code begins to function with tests on the hardware, it is able to be refined and developed over time.

This method insulates the new code from the old code, so that the reverse engineering is less likely to be considered by a jury as a derived work.

====Computer security====
The basic model used to provide both privacy and integrity for data is the &quot;Chinese wall model&quot; or the &quot;Brewer and Nash model&quot;. It is a security model where read/write access to files is governed by membership of data in conflict-of-interest classes and datasets.

<doc id="462853" wikidata="Q2383321" url="?curid=462853" title="Yield (finance)">
<text>In finance, the yield on a security is a measure of the ex-ante return to a holder of the security. It is one component of return on an investment, the other component being the change in the market price of the security. It is a measure applied to fixed income securities, common stocks, preferred stocks, convertible stocks and bonds, annuities and real estate investments.

There are various types of yield, and the method of calculation depends on the particular type of yield and the type of security.

== Fixed income securities ==

The coupon rate (or nominal rate) on a fixed income security is the interest that the issuer agrees to pay to the security holder each year, expressed as a percentage of the security&#x27;s principal amount (par value).

The current yield is the ratio of the annual interest (coupon) payment and the bond&#x27;s market price.

The yield to maturity is an estimate of the total rate of return anticipated to be earned by an investor who buys a bond at a given market price, holds it to maturity, and receives all interest payments and the payment of par value on schedule. Unlike current yield, it takes into account the payment of principal to the bondholder when the bond matures.

For bonds with embedded call or put options:
* yield to call uses the same methodology as the yield to maturity, but assumes that the issuer calls the bond at the first opportunity instead of allowing it to be held until maturity; 
* yield to put assumes that the bondholder sells the bond back to the issuer at the first opportunity; and 
* yield to worst is the lowest of the yield to all possible call dates, yield to all possible put dates and yield to maturity.

Par yield assumes that the security&#x27;s market price is equal to par value (also known as face value or nominal value). It is the metric used in the U.S. Treasury&#x27;s daily official &quot;Treasury Par Yield Curve Rates&quot;.

== Preferred shares ==
The dividend rate is the total amount of dividends paid in a year, divided by the principal value of the preferred share. The current yield is those same payments divided by the preferred share&#x27;s market price. If the preferred share has a maturity or call provision (which is not always the case), yield to maturity and yield to call can be calculated.

== Common shares ==
The current dividend yield is the annualized cash dividend (in dollars, RMB, Yen, etc.) divided by the current market price of one share. Most web sites and reports are updated with the expected future year&#x27;s payments, not the past year&#x27;s.

== REITs, royalty trusts, income trusts, annuities ==
Distribution yields from REITs, royalty trusts, income trusts and annuities often include return of capital, cash that exceeds the income earned.

== Real estate and property ==
Several different yields are used as measures of a real estate investment, including initial, equivalent and reversionary yields.

Initial yield is the annualised rents of a property expressed as a percentage of the property value.
E.g.
£100,000 passing rent per annum
£1,850,000 valuation
100000/1850000 = 0.054 or 5.4%

Reversionary yield is the anticipated yield to which the initial yield will rise (or fall) once the rent reaches the ERV.
E.g.
£150,000 ERV per annum
£1,850,000 valuation
150000/1850000 = 0.081 or 8.1%

Equivalent yield lies somewhere in between the initial yield and reversionary yield, it encapsulates the DCF of the property with rents rising (or falling) from the current annualised rent to the underlying estimated rental value (ERV) less costs that are incurred along the way. The discount rate used to calculate the net present value (NPV) of the DCF to equal zero is the equivalent yield, or the IRR.

The calculation not only takes into account all costs, but other assumptions including rent reviews and void periods. A trial and error method can be used to identify the equivalent yield of a DCF, or if using Excel, the goal seek function can be used.

==Factors affecting the yield==
All financial instruments compete with each other in the financial markets. Investor perceptions of risk influence the yield they require to justify investment in a particular security. Higher yields allow owners to recoup their investments sooner, and so lessen risk. All other things being equal, the weaker the credit rating of the issuer, the higher the yield must be. This reflects the tendency for investors to require compensation for the additional risk that the issuer may default on its obligations to pay interest and repay the principal at par value.

Yield levels vary with expectations of inflation and the general outlook for the economy (the business cycle). Fears of high inflation in the future mean that investors ask for a higher yield today to protect their purchasing power.

The yield on a fixed income security is inversely related to financial market interest rates. If market rates rise, for example due to inflation or a change in the economy, the price of a bond or note falls, driving its yield higher to maintain parity with market rates. Conversely, if market rates decline, then the price of the bond should increase, driving its yield lower, all else being equal.

Under normal market conditions, long-term fixed income securities (for example, a 10-year bond) have higher yields than short-term securities (e.g., a 2-year bond). This reflects the fact that long-term securities are more exposed to the uncertainties of what could happen in the future—especially changes in market rates of interest. Therefore, longer maturity securities have more potential price volatility. The relationship between yield and maturity is described by the yield curve.

== Special cases ==
Coupon payments from floating rate bonds and notes and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities are reset periodically based on a specified benchmark. It is not possible to accurately calculate the future stream of coupon payments from these securities, so yield to maturity and internal rates of return cannot be calculated. Other metrics must be used.

<doc id="462858" wikidata="Q164674" url="?curid=462858" title="Stephen Poliakoff">
<text>Stephen Poliakoff (born 1 December 1952) is a British playwright, director and screenwriter. In 2006 Gerard Gilbert of &quot;The Independent&quot; described him as the UK&#x27;s &quot;pre-eminent TV dramatist&quot; who had &quot;inherited Dennis Potter&#x27;s crown&quot;.

==Early life==
Poliakoff was born in Holland Park, West London, to Ina (née Montagu) and Alexander Poliakoff. His father was a Russian-Jewish immigrant and his mother was a British Jew. His maternal grandfather had bought 16th-century mansion Great Fosters, and his maternal great-grandfather was Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling.

The second of four children, he was sent at a young age to Marlborough House School, which he hated. He then attended Westminster School, where he attracted sufficient attention for &quot;Granny&quot;, a play he wrote and directed, to be reviewed in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper. He was still at Westminister when Michael Rudman commissioned Poliakoff&#x27;s first professionally produced play, &quot;A Day With my Sister,&quot; which premiered at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh directed by David Halliwell in 1971. 
After Westminster, he went to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge to read history but left after two years, later recalling Cambridge as &quot;a stuffy place&quot; and the history course as &quot;shockingly bad&quot;.

== Professional life ==

=== Theatre ===
Poliakoff continued to write stage plays, becoming writer-in-residence for the National Theatre at the age of 24, but he became increasingly interested in the medium of television, with &quot;Stronger Than the Sun&quot; (1977 – BBC1 &quot;Play for Today&quot;), &quot;Bloody Kids&quot; (1980 – ATV) directed by Stephen Frears, &quot;Caught on a Train&quot; (1980 – BBC2 &quot;Playhouse&quot;) starring Peggy Ashcroft, and &quot; Soft Targets&quot; (1982 – &quot;Play for Today&quot;). There were also TV adaptations of his stage plays &quot;Hitting Town&quot; (1976 – Thames Television/ITV &quot;Plays for Britain&quot;) and &quot; City Sugar&quot; (1978 – Scottish Television / ITV &quot;The Sunday Drama&quot;). These two plays were among his earliest big successes.

Poliakoff&#x27;s theatre, although well received critically, has never achieved a great level of attention from the critics, apart from their reviews. This has been attributed to the ambiguity of his politics. His approach towards political issues has been described as individual in nature rather than generalising. Some of the recurring themes in his works have been recognised as environmental pollution, due to human intervention, both rural and urban. Most of his plays portray contemporary Britain. He is scared of and fascinated by fascism. He said: &quot;I&#x27;m writing about what&#x27;s happening now, about people searching for beliefs in what is no longer a religious country, and about how individuals of charisma and power can polarise things.&quot;

A full length study of his work, &quot;Stephen Poliakoff: On Stage and Screen&quot;, was published in 2011 by Robin Nelson.

Nearly all of Poliakoff&#x27;s plays premiered in London, four at the National Theatre, four at the Royal Shakespeare Company and at the Almeida, Hampstead, Bush and Royal Court. Three of his plays have transferred to the West End. Many of the plays have been performed across Europe and also in the US, Australia and Japan.

In 1976, Poliakoff won the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Most Promising Playwright Award for &quot;Hitting Town&quot; and &quot;City Sugar&quot; and in 1997 he won the Critic&#x27;s Circle Best Play Award for the National Theatre production of &quot;Blinded By The Sun&quot;.

=== Television and cinema ===
Poliakoff&#x27;s first feature film was &quot;Runners&quot;, directed by Charles Sturridge, starring James Fox, Jane Asher and Kate Hardie. It received a limited theatrical release in 1983 before being shown in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Film on Four&quot; slot. His directorial debut was the much-lauded and now rare &quot;Hidden City&quot; (1988), premiered at the Venice Film Festival and starring Charles Dance, Richard E. Grant and Cassie Stuart. His television career continued with &quot;She&#x27;s Been Away&quot; (1989) starring Peggy Ashcroft and also winning awards at Venice, before a return to film with &quot;Close My Eyes&quot; (1991), starring Clive Owen, Saskia Reeves and Alan Rickman in an elaborate reworking of the incest theme that had been central to &quot;Hitting Town&quot; (1976), followed by &quot;Century&quot; (1994), with Owen, Dance and Miranda Richardson. Less successful were &quot;Food of Love&quot; (1997) with Grant, Nathalie Baye and Joe McGann and &quot;The Tribe&quot; (1998) starring Joely Richardson and Jeremy Northam, the latter eventually screened on BBC Two in the absence of a cinema distribution deal where it achieved extremely high viewing figures and was immediately repeated.

He subsequently returned to his favoured form, television, this time choosing a flexible serial format resulting in the acclaimed and Prix Italia-winning &quot;Shooting the Past&quot; (1999), the fresh critical and audience success of &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; (2001), a family drama starring Matthew Macfadyen, Michael Gambon and Lindsay Duncan and &quot;The Lost Prince&quot; (2003), a single drama recognised with an Emmy award rare for a non-American production. The film also featured Miranda Richardson in a Golden Globe-nominated performance as Queen Mary of Teck. Michael Gambon, Gina McKee, Tom Hollander and Bill Nighy appeared in major roles. Late 2005 saw the one-off drama &quot;Friends and Crocodiles&quot; (2006) starring Damian Lewis and Jodhi May, with its overlapping companion piece, &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2006), starring Bill Nighy, Miranda Richardson and Emily Blunt, appearing early the following year. The latter won a Peabody Award in April 2007, with Golden Globes for Nighy and Blunt.

In 2005, he renewed recent criticisms of BBC scheduling and commissioning policy, arguing that the reintroduction of a regular evening slot for one-off plays on BBC1 would provide the re-invigoration of drama output that has become a priority for the corporation.

&quot;Joe&#x27;s Palace&quot; was screened on 4 November 2007 on BBC One and &quot;Capturing Mary&quot; was screened on BBC Two on 12 November 2007. &quot;The Culture Show&quot; also screened a Poliakoff special, including an interview between Poliakoff and Mark Kermode and a new TV play, &quot;A Real Summer&quot;, on 10 November.

&quot;Glorious 39&quot;, starring Romola Garai, Bill Nighy and Julie Christie, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2009 and was released in the UK that November.

In 2011, Poliakoff wrote a seven-minute short film, &quot;Astonish Me&quot;, to celebrate WWF&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Starring Bill Nighy and Gemma Arterton, the film was shown in Odeon Cinemas in August 2011 and made available on the WWF website and YouTube.

In February and March 2013, &quot;Dancing on the Edge&quot;, a five-part series which followed the fortunes of a black jazz band in 1930s London, was broadcast by the BBC, and also later won a Golden Globe.

In November/December 2016, his seven-part series &quot;Close to the Enemy&quot; was transmitted on BBC Two. &quot;Close to the Enemy&quot; is set in a bombed-out London in the aftermath of the Second World War.

Poliakoff wrote and directed &quot;Summer of Rockets&quot;, a semi-autobiographical six-part series broadcast by the BBC in June 2019. It is set in 1958, just as the UK is testing its first hydrogen bomb, and focuses on a Russian Jewish hearing aid inventor (Toby Stephens) who goes to work for MI5. It also stars Keeley Hawes, Linus Roache, and Timothy Spall.

==Personal life==
Stephen Poliakoff lives in London and is married to fellow scriptwriter Sandy Welch, with whom he has two children. He was awarded a CBE in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours list 2007.

His brother, Sir Martyn Poliakoff, a research chemist and lecturer, is a Fellow of the Royal Society, being, until November 2016, its Foreign Secretary and vice-president. He is also the presenter of a YouTube educational series on chemistry, &quot;The Periodic Table of Videos&quot;.

Poliakoff&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Joseph, was a Russian Jew who experienced first-hand the effects of the communist revolution in Russia from the family&#x27;s Moscow flat across from the Kremlin. Near starvation after the revolution, he was given a government job as a district telephone inspector from an admiring commissar and he helped build Moscow&#x27;s first automatic telephone exchange. He then fled with his family from the Soviet Union to the UK in 1924.

Joseph Poliakoff was an inventor of electrical devices whose many inventions included a selenium photograph telephony shutter in 1899 (US patent 700,100, 26 August 1901), which, along with electrical sound amplification, allowed for synchronised audio on film, the radio volume control, a magnetic induction loop that allowed hearing-impaired people to hear in auditoriums or theatres, and the paging beeper. He also founded the Multitone Electric Company of London in 1931 that produced hearing aid devices with their most prestigious customer being Winston Churchill. Joseph&#x27;s experiences under the Bolsheviks inspired Poliakoff&#x27;s 1984 play &quot;Breaking the Silence&quot;. Several of these attributes (such as the pager, and hearing aids, including Churchill&#x27;s) were ascribed to the lead character in &quot;Summer of Rockets&quot;.

<doc id="462862" wikidata="Q17149347" url="?curid=462862" title="Minicomic">
<text>A minicomic is a creator-published comic book, often photocopied and stapled or with a handmade binding. In the United Kingdom and Europe the term [[British small press comics|small press comic]] is equivalent with minicomic, reserved for those publications measuring A6 (105 mm × 148 mm) or less.

Minicomics, sometimes called ashcan copies, and sometimes zine comics, are a common inexpensive way for those who want to make their own comics on a very small budget, with mostly informal means of distribution. A number of cartoonists — such as Jessica Abel, Julie Doucet, and Adrian Tomine — have started their careers this way and later gone on to more traditional types of publishing, while other established artists — such as Matt Feazell and John Porcellino — continue to publish minicomics as their main means of production. 

==Overview==
The term &quot;minicomic&quot; was originally used in the United States and has a somewhat confusing history. Originally, it referred only to size: a &quot;digest comic&quot; measured 5.5 inches wide by 8.5 inches tall, while a &quot;minicomic&quot; was 5.5 inches by 4.25 inches. 

Currently, there is no standard format for a minicomic. Anything between something the size of a postage stamp to regular comic book size can be considered a minicomic. The term &quot;minicomic&quot; is used in a more general sense, emphasizing the publication&#x27;s handmade, informal aspect rather than the format. By this loose definition, a single photocopied page folded in quarters would still be a minicomic, but so would a thicker digest-sized comic, or even a large, elaborate, and relatively expensive photocopied booklet with a silkscreened cover. Even some professionally printed and bound booklets are referred to as minicomics, as long as they are published by the artist and marketed in minicomic venues, but this usage is controversial. 

Many minicomics are non-standard comic book sizes for aesthetic reasons, or are often connected to graphic design and book print &quot;tricks&quot; to look good. Many of these typical sizes are convenient for artists using standard office supplies: a US letter page can be folded in half to make a digest, or in quarters for a minicomic. These comics are generally photocopied, although some are produced in larger quantities using offset printing. 

In North America, the United Kingdom, and Malaysia, minicomics are rarely found in traditional &quot;direct market&quot; comic-book stores; they are often sold directly by the artist at book fairs or through the mail, ordered from websites, or handled by small bookstores and distributors that carry zines. In terms of production and distribution issues and their audience, minicomics—of all of the sizes and types mentioned above—have much more in common with each other, and with zines, than with any traditionally published comics. In Europe many specialized comic books stores have a special little corner dedicated to the odd off-size little self-printed books. At comic book conventions, such as the one in Angoulême, there are large markets where the little books are available. Because most of the books are rather cheap and were printed in limited quantities, they have become a target of collecters.

Minicomics typically have no editorial oversight, and both their content and quality vary widely. Many of the creators of minicomics do not expect to make a significant amount of money, or even cover their costs, with the price they charge for their comics.

==History==
=== 1920s–1950s ===
The earliest and most popular comics in mini- and digest sizes—predating not only the term &quot;minicomic&quot;, but even the standard comic-book format—were the anonymous and pornographic Tijuana bibles of the 1920s.

=== 1960s ===
The underground publisher San Francisco Comic Book Company, run by Gary Arlington, published a number of minicomics in the period 1968–1976, including minicomics by Art Spiegelman, Bill Griffith, and Leonard Rifas.

In , Carl Gafford created Blue Plaque Publications, the first minicomic co-op, a cooperative of minicomic creators that traded and promoted small press comics and fanzines.

=== 1970s ===
Jack T. Chick&#x27;s &quot;Chick tracts&quot;, which began appearing widely in the early 1970s, use a mini-size, although their content and purpose are atypical of most mincomics.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, Clay Geerdes&#x27;s &quot;Comix World&quot; published numerous popular minicomics, and Artie Romero&#x27;s Everyman Studios created dozens of titles with full color covers. The Everyman Comics mini-series included solo books by Romero, Hunt Emerson, Larry Rippee, Jim Siergey, Bob Conway, Gary Whitney, Bob Vojtko, J. Michael Leonard, and John Adams, plus a number of themed anthology minicomics. Several minicomics each of these publishers were reprinted in their entirety in Fantagraphics&#x27; &quot;The Underground Mini Comix of the 1980s.&quot;

=== 1980s ===
Matt Feazell&#x27;s popular &quot;Cynicalman&quot; mincomics, which began in 1980, utilize the US letter page folded in quarters; the same format used by Alfred Huete&#x27;s award-winning &quot;DADA&quot; mini.

Many minicomics in the 1980s were produced by artists influenced by the underground comix scene who were unable to get work published in underground and alternative publications. Michael Dowers&#x27; Starhead Comix published many minicomics throughout the latter half of the 1980s, before the company moved to traditional comic book printing and distribution.

John Porcellino&#x27;s &quot;King-Cat Comics&quot;, first published in May 1989 and still being published, is among the best-known and longest-running minicomics titles.

In 1989 and 1990, Roger May published minicomics made of work done at those years&#x27; respective San Diego Comic-Cons. The first one, titled &quot;Open Season: the Mini Comic&quot;, included work from Jaime Hernandez, Sergio Aragonés, Guy Colwell, Eddie Campbell, Bryan Talbot, Val Mayerik, Scott Shaw, Howard Cruse, Angela Bocage, Stephen Bissette, Mario Hernandez, Larry Marder, Mary Fleener, David A. Cherry, Joshua Quagmire, Clayton Moore, Phoebe Gloeckner, Steve Lafler, Terry Beatty, William Stout, J. R. Williams, Rick Geary, and Paul Mavrides. The second issue, created at the 1990 convention, was titled &quot;Graphic Babylon: San Diego Comic Con Minicomix 1990.&quot; The all-star roster of contributors included Robert Williams, Orz, Mary Fleener, Mercy Van Vlack, Bob Burden, L. Lois Buhalis, Guy Colwell, Sergio Aragonés, Angela Bocage, Larry Marder, Chuck Austen, Terry Laban, Larry Todd, Mark Bodé, Ray Zone, Larry Welz, Scott Shaw, Michael T. Gilbert, Rick Geary, Phil Foglio, Wayno, J. R. Williams, and Dan O&#x27;Neill.

=== 1990s ===
In the 1990s, before the widespread adoption of the World Wide Web, minicomics became a popular form of self-distribution for alternative cartoonists, aided by such publications as &quot;Factsheet Five&quot;. Comic book series like Jessica Abel&#x27;s &quot;Artbabe&quot;, Julie Doucet&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Plotte&quot;, and Adrian Tomine&#x27;s &quot;Optic Nerve&quot; all started out as self-published minicomics before being picked up by legitimate publishers.

In 1993, Rick Bradford (who had been involved in the minicomics scene since 1985) began publishing &quot;Poopsheet&quot;, a zine that reviewed other small publications, including minicomics. &quot;Poopsheet&quot; eventually became a website and is now known as The Poopsheet Foundation, which is dedicated to archiving the history of minicomics.

The Ignatz Award for Best Minicomic has been awarded at the Small Press Expo every year since 1997.

=== 2000s–present ===
In 2003, cartoonists Andy Hartzell and Jesse Reklaw co-founded Global Hobo Distro, a distributor dedicated to hand-made and hard-to-find comics that was partnered with Last Gasp. Global Hobo operated until 2013.

== Minicomics collections ==
* 

==Alternate meaning==
The term minicomic also refers to the small comics booklets that come in the packages of some toys:

* Masters of the Universe (1981–2014) — The first Masters of the Universe toys did not have a TV series, and thus came with little story booklets (and later, comics) that showed the original background of the series (He-Man as a barbarian, Skeletor from another dimension, etc.). However, after the later sources (DC Comics and the TV series) started to change that background (He-Man as Prince Adam, for example) the comics began to reflect those changes. See List of He-Man Minicomics.
* Atari Force (1982) — a five-issue series included with certain Atari 2600 game cartridges.
* Swordquest (1982–1983) — three comics included with the Atari 2600 cartridges for the Swordquest series.
* Super Powers (1984–1985) — Kenner Products created a collection of action figures based on the DC Comics super-heroes and super-villains called &quot;Super Powers&quot;. The first two waves of the collection came with minicomics which featured the character with which it came, one of the villains from the collection (who, obviously, was the antagonist of the story inside the comic) and other heroes featured in the collection. See List of Super Powers Minicomics.
* Transformers (2002–2005) — the toys of and came with minicomics that featured the characters of the toy lines.
* Marvel Mega Morphs (2005) — this was a toy line created by Toy Biz in order to compete with Hasbro&#x27;s Transformers. The Mega Morphs were transforming robots patterned on Marvel Comics superheroes. Each figure came with a minicomic featuring the Megamorph with which it came. All six minicomics formed a complete storyline.

<text>The Adolphus Hotel is a historic upscale hotel established in 1912 in the Main Street District of Downtown Dallas, Texas. A Dallas Landmark, it was for several years the tallest building in the state. Today, the hotel is part of Marriott&#x27;s Autograph Collection brand.

==History==
The hotel was developed by Adolphus Busch, founder of the Anheuser-Busch company. He already owned the Oriental Hotel, across the street from the present hotel, when he was approached by a group of prominent Dallas businessmen in 1910 with the idea of constructing the first European-style luxury hotel in the city. Busch purchased Dallas&#x27;s old City Hall on June 22, 1910, demolished it, and constructed the new hotel at a cost of $1.8 million. The name was announced as the New Oriental Hotel. It was designed by Thomas P. Barnett of Barnett, Haynes &amp; Barnett of St. Louis in the Beaux Arts style. The 22-story, 312-foot (95 m) building would be the tallest in Texas until it was surpassed by the Magnolia Petroleum Building, ten years later.

By the time the hotel opened, on October 5, 1912, its name had been changed to match its builder, the Adolphus Hotel. The hotel was expanded multiple times, in 1916, 1926, and 1950, eventually filling much of a city block, and giving the hotel a total of 1,200 rooms. Under the management of Otto Schubert from 1922 to 1946, the hotel grew to national prominence. In the 1930s it was run by hotel industry pioneer Ralph Hitz&#x27;s National Hotel Management Company and played host to many big band musicians of the era, including Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller.

The Adolphus has been the host of many respected leaders of business, government and entertainment, including presidents, from Warren G. Harding to George H. W. Bush. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip stayed at the hotel in 1991. The hotel was a Dallas hub for entertainment and provided a platform that helped developing careers, such as Bob Hope, Jack Benny and others. North American Aviation (P-51 Mustangs, World War II) and others benefited from its position as a Texas business hub.

In 1980, the Adolphus underwent an $80 million renovation, which decreased the total number of rooms to 428 by combining multiple outdated guest rooms into larger ones. The Adolphus was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The hotel was extensively renovated again in 2017.

The Hotel has been named one of the top ten in the United States by Condé Nast Traveler and also receives high ratings from Zagat, Fodor&#x27;s and Frommer&#x27;s.

The structure is a Dallas Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="462871" wikidata="Q2120109" url="?curid=462871" title="Steward Observatory">
<text>Steward Observatory is the research arm of the Department of Astronomy at the University of Arizona (UArizona). Its offices are located on the UArizona campus in Tucson, Arizona (US). Established in 1916, the first telescope and building were formally dedicated on April 23, 1923. It operates, or is a partner in telescopes at five mountain-top locations in Arizona, one in New Mexico, one in Hawaii, and one in Chile. It has provided instruments for three different space telescopes and numerous terrestrial ones. Steward has one of the few facilities in the world that can cast and figure the very large primary mirrors used in telescopes built in the early 21st century.

==History==

Steward Observatory owes its existence to the efforts of American astronomer and dendrochronologist Andrew Ellicott Douglass. In 1906, Douglass accepted a position as Assistant Professor of Physics and Geography at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. Almost immediately upon his arrival in Tucson, Douglass established astronomical research programs using an 8-inch refracting telescope on loan from the Harvard College Observatory and actively began to pursue funding to construct a large research-class telescope in Tucson. Over the next 10 years, all of Douglass’ efforts to secure funding from the University and the Arizona Territorial (and later State) Legislatures ended in failure. During this time period, Douglass served UArizona as Head of the Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Interim President, and finally Dean of the College of Letters, Arts, &amp; Sciences.

Then on October 18, 1916, University President Rufus B. von KleinSmid announced that an anonymous donor had given the University $60,000 “…to be used to buy a telescope of huge size.” That donor was later revealed to be Mrs. Lavinia Steward of Oracle, Arizona. Mrs. Steward was a wealthy widow who had an interest in astronomy and a desire to memorialize her late husband, Mr. Henry Steward. Douglass made plans to use the Steward gift to construct a 36-inch diameter Newtonian reflecting telescope. The Warner &amp; Swasey Company of Cleveland, Ohio was contracted to build the telescope, but the United States entry into World War I delayed the contract since Warner &amp; Swasey had war contracts that took priority. The situation was further delayed by the fact that up until this time, the expertise in large telescope mirror making was in Europe. The war made it impossible to contract with a European company. So Douglass had to find an American glass company that was willing to develop this expertise. After a couple of failed castings, the Spencer Lens Co. of Buffalo, New York ultimately produced a 36-inch mirror for the Steward Telescope.

The telescope was finally installed in the observatory building in July 1922, and the Steward Observatory was officially dedicated on April 23, 1923. In his dedication address, Douglass recounted the trials and tribulations of establishing the observatory, then gave the following eloquent justification for the scientific endeavor:

In concluding I wish to leave with you a more general view. This installation is to be devoted to scientific research. Scientific research is business foresight on a large scale. It is knowledge obtained before it is needed. Knowledge is power, but we cannot tell which fact in the domain of knowledge is the one which is going to give the power, and we therefore develop the idea of knowledge for its own sake, confident that some one fact or training will pay for all the effort. This I believe is the essence of education wherever such education is not strictly vocational. The student learns many facts and has much training. He can only dimly see which fact and which training will be of eminent use to him, but some special part of his education will take root in him and grow and pay for all of the effort which he and his friends have put into it. So it is with the research institutions. In this Observatory I sincerely hope and expect that the boundaries of human knowledge will be advanced along astronomical lines. Astronomy was the first science developed by our primitive ancestors thousands of years ago because it measured time. Performing that same function, it has played a vast part in human history, and today it is telling us facts, forever wonderful, about the size of our universe; perhaps tomorrow it will give us practical help in showing us how to predict climatic conditions in the future.
==Observatories==

Steward Observatory manages three different observing locations in southern Arizona: Mount Graham International Observatory (MGIO), Mount Lemmon Station, and Catalina Station on Mount Bigelow. It also operates telescopes at two additional important observatories: Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) and Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopkins. Steward is a partner in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III, which is located in New Mexico at Apache Point Observatory. Steward used to maintain a student observatory on Tumamoc Hill approximately west of the campus, but that is no longer in operation. The original observatory dome in Tucson now houses the Ray White Jr. 21-inch telescope and is used for public outreach and undergraduate education.

The Arizona Radio Observatory, a part (sub-unit) of Steward Observatory, operates the SMT 10m diameter millimeter-wavelength radio telescope on Mount Graham and UArizona 12m diameter millimeter-wavelength radio telescope on Kitt Peak.

Steward Observatory participates in many partnered projects. It is a full member in the twin Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory in northern Chile. It is also a member in organizations that originated two projects planned for same region: the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, now the Vera Rubin Observatory, and the Giant Magellan Telescope, a next generation extremely large telescope. The Richard F. Caris Mirror Laboratory completed the primary and tertiary mirrors for LSST and is fabricating the primary mirror segments, each 8.4m in diameter, for the GMT.

==Research groups==

The Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab, located under the east side of Arizona Stadium, has pioneered new techniques of large mirror production, including spin-casting lightweight honeycomb mirrors in a rotating furnace, and stressed-lap polishing. The Mirror Laboratory completed the second mirror for the Large Binocular Telescope in September, 2005. The Mirror Lab also cast the 8.4 meter diameter primary/tertiary mirror for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and has cast the central mirror and five of the seven off-axis primary mirrors for the Giant Magellan Telescope.

The Infrared Detector Laboratory built the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) instrument for the Hubble Space Telescope and the Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS) instrument for the Spitzer Space Telescope. For the James Webb Space Telescope, Steward built the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and helped build the Mid-IR Instrument (MIRI).

Other groups include the Center for Astronomical Adaptive Optics (CAAO), the Imaging Technology Laboratory (ITL), the Steward Observatory Radio Astronomy Laboratory (SORAL), the Earths in Other Solar Systems (EOS) group, and the Astrochemistry/Spectroscopy Laboratory.

<doc id="462887" wikidata="Q127515" url="?curid=462887" title="Chipewyan">
<text>The Chipewyan ( , also called Denésoliné or Dënesųłı̨né or Dënë Sųłınë́, meaning &quot;the original/real people&quot;) are a Dene Indigenous Canadian people of the Athabaskan language family, whose ancestors are identified with the Taltheilei Shale archaeological tradition. They are part of the Northern Athabascan group of peoples, and hail from what is now Western Canada.

== Terminology ==

The term &quot;Chipewyan&quot; () is a Cree exonym meaning &#x27;pointed hides&#x27;, referring to the design of their parkas.

The French-speaking missionaries to the northwest of the Red River Colony referred to the Chipewyan people as Montagnais in their documents written in French. Montagnais simply means &#x27;mountain people&#x27; or &#x27;highlanders&#x27; in French and has been applied to many unrelated nations across North America over time. For example, the Neenolino Innu of northern Quebec are also called .
==Demographics==
Chipewyan peoples live in the region spanning the western Canadian Shield to the Northwest Territories, including northern parts of the provinces of Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan. There are also many burial and archaeological sites in Nunavut which are part of the Dënesųłı̨ne group.

The following list of First Nations band governments had in August 2016 a total registered membership of 25,519, with 11,315 in Saskatchewan, 6,952 in Alberta, 3,038 in Manitoba and 4,214 in the Northwest Territories. All had Denesuline populations; however, several had a combination of Cree and Denesuline members (see the Barren Lands First Nation in Manitoba and the Fort McMurray First Nation in Alberta).

There are also many Dene (Dënesųlı̨ne)-speaking Métis communities located throughout the region. The Saskatchewan village of La Loche, for example, had 2,300 residents who in the 2011 census identified as speaking Dene (Denesuline) as their native language. About 1,800 of the residents were Métis and about 600 were members of the Clearwater River Dene Nation.

== Commemorations ==
The relocation of the Sayisi Dene is commemorated by the Dene Memorial in Churchill Manitoba.

==Governance==
The Dënesųłı̨ne people are part of many band governments spanning Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and the Northwest Territories.

== Historical Chipewyan regional groups ==


The Chipewyan moved in small groups or bands, consisting of several extended families, alternating between winter and summer camps. The groups participated in hunting, trapping, fishing and gathering in Canada&#x27;s boreal forest and around the many lakes of their territory. Later, with the emerging North American fur trade, they organized into several major regional groups in the vicinity of the European trading posts to control, as middleman, the carrying trade in furs and the hunting of fur-bearing animals. The new social groupings also enabled the Chipewyan to dominate their Dene neighbours and to better defend themselves against their rifle-armed Cree enemies, who were advancing to the Peace River and Lake Athabasca.

They were often regarded as a Chipewyan group, but form as &quot;Yellowknives&quot; historically an independent First Nation and called themselves &quot;T&#x27;atsaot&#x27;ine (T&#x27;átsąnót&#x27;ı̨ne&quot;).

==Ethnography==

Historically, the Denesuline were allied to some degree with the southerly Cree, and warred against Inuit and other Dene peoples to the north of Chipewyan lands.

An important historic Denesuline is Thanadelthur (&quot;Marten Jumping&quot;), a young woman who early in the 18th century helped her people to establish peace with the Cree, and to get involved with the fur trade (Steckley 1999).

The Sayisi Dene of northern Manitoba are a Chipewyan band notable for hunting migratory caribou. They were historically located at Little Duck Lake and known as the &quot;Duck Lake Dene&quot;. In 1956, the government forcibly relocated them to the port of Churchill on the shore of Hudson Bay and a small village north of Churchill called North Knife River, joining other Dene and becoming members of &quot;Fort Churchill Chipewyan Band&quot;. In the 1970s, the &quot;Duck Lake Dene&quot; opted for self-reliance, a return to caribou hunting, and relocated to Tadoule Lake, Manitoba, legally becoming &quot;Sayisi Dene First Nation (Tadoule Lake, Manitoba)&quot; in the 1990s. https://uofmpress.ca/books/detail/night-spirits

== Culture ==
The Chipewyan used to be largely nomadic, organized into small bands and temporarily lived in tepees. They wore one-piece pants and moccasin outfits. However, their nomadic lifestyle began to erode since 1717 when they encountered English entrepreneurs. The Chipewyan subsequently became important in the subarctic trade by exchanging furs and hides for metal tools, guns and cloth.

Modern Chipewyan are either fluidly sedentary or semi-nomadic in lifestyle. Many still practice their traditional lifestyle for subsistence like fishing or hunting caribou although this process is modernized with the use of modern nets, tools, transportation and more.

== Language ==
Denesuline (Chipewyan) speak the Denesuline language, of the Athabaskan linguistic group. Denesuline is spoken by Aboriginal people in Canada whose name for themselves is a cognate of the word (&quot;people&quot;): (or ). Speakers of the language speak different dialects but understand each other. There is a &#x27;k&#x27;, t dialect that most people speak. For example, people in Fond du lac, speak the &#x27;k&#x27; and say while others who use the &#x27;t&#x27; say .

The name &quot;Chipewyan&quot; is, like many people of the Canadian prairies, of Algonquian origin. It is derived from the Plains Cree name for them, (), &quot;pointed skin&quot;, from (), &quot;to be pointed&quot;; and (), &quot;skin&quot; or &quot;hide&quot; - a reference to the cut and style of Chipewyan parkas.

Most Chipewyan people now use &quot;Dene&quot; and &quot;Denesuline&quot; to describe themselves and their language. The Saskatchewan communities of Fond-du-Lac, Black Lake and Wollaston Lake are a few.

Despite the superficial similarity of the names, the Chipewyan are not related to the &quot;Chippewa&quot; (Ojibwa) people.

In 2015, Shene Catholique-Valpy, a Chipewyan woman in the Northwest Territories, challenged the territorial government over its refusal to permit her to use the letter in her daughter&#x27;s name, Sahaiʔa. The territory argued that territorial and federal identity documents were unable to accommodate the letter. Sahaiʔa&#x27;s mother finally registered her name with a hyphen in place of the , while continuing to challenge the policy. Shortly afterward, another woman named Andrea Heron also challenged the territory on the same grounds, for refusing to accept the letter in her daughter&#x27;s Slavey name, Sakaeʔah (actually a cognate of Sahaiʔa).

<text>IBM UltraPort was a nonstandard USB 1.1 port used by IBM on its range of ThinkPad laptop computers.

==Description==

Electronically the UltraPort connector is identical to the standard USB port. UltraPort uses a proprietary mechanical connection, so UltraPort devices cannot be plugged into a normal USB interface. However, the UltraPort devices shipped with an adapter which allowed them to be attached to a regular USB port.

Select ThinkPad models from 2000 to 2002 came with an UltraPort connector on the top edge of the laptop&#x27;s screen, and IBM sold a variety of laptop-relevant UltraPort devices, including webcams, speakers, and microphone arrays.

UltraPort was designed in 1999 in response to the proliferation of many laptop computers from Sony, Fujitsu, and others that had built-in cameras, but proprietary predecessor can be found on a released in 1996 ThinkPad 850 laptop.

<text>Wheatley Place is a neighborhood in South Dallas, Texas, that is designated as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and as a somewhat smaller Dallas Landmark District by the city. Included among the buildings that compose the historic district is the Juanita J. Craft Civil Rights House, a museum that was the former home of Dallas civil rights pioneer, Juanita Craft. The house is a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark and is included within the NRHP district but not the municipal landmark district.

Predominantly constructed as a neighborhood for African-Americans, the area was named for Phillis Wheatley, an African-American poet from the 18th century, who was the first African-American author of a published book of poetry.

The district was listed on the National Register on March 23, 1995, and the Dallas City Council designated Wheatley Place as a historic landmark district on October 25, 2000.

<doc id="462905" wikidata="Q7883437" url="?curid=462905" title="Underarm bowling">
<text>Underarm bowling is a style of bowling in cricket. The style is as old as the sport itself. Until the introduction of the roundarm style in the first half of the 19th century, bowling was performed in the same way as in the sport of bowls, with the ball being delivered with the hand below the waist. Bowls may well be an older game than cricket and it is possible that it provided a template for delivering a ball with a degree of accuracy.

==History==
For centuries, bowling in cricket was performed exactly as in the sport of bowls because the ball was rolled or skimmed along the ground. The bowlers may have used variations in pace but the basic action was essentially the same. There are surviving illustrations from the first half of the eighteenth century which depict the bowler with one knee bent forward and his bowling hand close to the ground, while the ball trundles (if slow) or skims (if quick) towards a batsman armed with a bat shaped something like a large hockey stick and guarding a two-stump wicket.

Cricket&#x27;s first great bowling revolution occurred probably in the 1760s when bowlers started to pitch the ball instead of rolling it along the ground. The change was evolutionary and has been described as the event that took cricket out of its &quot;pioneering phase&quot; into what may be termed its &quot;pre-modern phase&quot; (i.e., which ended when overarm bowling ushered in the modern game in 1864) and effectively created a different code of cricket, just as there are now two different codes of rugby football.

The pitched delivery was well established by 1772 when detailed scorecards became commonplace and the straight bat had already replaced the curved one by that time. There is no doubt that the straight bat was invented to contest the pitched delivery. It has been said that the inventor was John Small of Hambledon but it is unlikely that he actually invented it; rather, he was the first great batsman to master its use.

The 1760s are one of cricket&#x27;s &quot;Dark Ages&quot;; a good deal more is known about the decades 1731–1750 than of 1751–1770. This has largely to do with the impact of the Seven Years&#x27; War of 1756–1763 which not only claimed the sport&#x27;s manpower but also its patronage. Pitching may have begun during that period, but little is known about it for it seems to have been introduced and widely accepted without the huge controversies that surrounded the later implementations of roundarm and overarm.

The first known codification of the Laws of Cricket, created by the London Cricket Club in 1744, makes no mention of prescribed bowling action and does not say the ball must be delivered at ground level, which suggests a pitched delivery would not be illegal. The rules for bowlers in the 1744 Laws focus on the position of the hind foot during delivery (i.e., it had to be behind the bowling crease) and overstepping is the only specified cause for calling a no-ball. The umpires were granted &quot;discretion&quot; and so presumably would call no-ball if, say, a ball was thrown by the bowler.

One of the first great bowlers to employ the pitched delivery to good effect was Edward &quot;Lumpy&quot; Stevens of Chertsey and Surrey. There is a surviving rhyme about him to the effect that &quot;honest Lumpy did allow he ne&#x27;er would pitch but o&#x27;er a brow&quot;. In those days, the leading bowler on each side had choice of precisely where the wickets would be placed and Lumpy was adept at finding a spot where the turf was uneven on a good length so that he could use his repertoire of shooters, twisters and risers. Lumpy was a true professional who studied the arts and crafts of the game to seek continuous improvement as a bowler. He is known to have observed the flight of the ball and experimented for long hours with variations of line, length and speed of delivery until he had mastered the art of pitching.

Other great bowlers of the late 18th century were Thomas Brett and David Harris, both of the Hambledon club. They were fast bowlers whereas Lumpy relied on variety of pace. A notable bowler of the time was Lamborn who spun the ball in an unorthodox fashion and may have been the first unorthodox spinner.

Underarm bowling was effective while pitch conditions were difficult for batsmen due to being uneven and uncovered. In time, especially after the opening of Lord&#x27;s and the development of groundsmanship, pitches began to improve and batsmen were able to play longer innings than previously. In the 1780s and 1790s, one of the best batsmen around was Tom Walker, who was also a very useful slow bowler. Walker was another improviser like Lumpy and he began to experiment by bowling with his hand away from his body. It is not clear how high he raised his hand but it could have been waist height. He was accused of &quot;jerking&quot; the ball and so delivering it in an unfair and improper manner. He was censured for his trouble and was forced to return to his normal underarm lobs, but he had sown the seeds of bowling&#x27;s next revolution.

This was roundarm, so called because the hand is held out from the body (i.e., between waist and shoulder height) at the point of delivery. The roundarm style was promoted successively by John Willes, William Lillywhite and Jem Broadbridge until it was finally legalised, amid furious controversy, in 1835 with an amendment to the rule in 1845.

Roundarm did not mean the end of underarm, which continued well into the overarm era that began in 1864. William Clarke, founder of the All England Eleven in 1845, remained a highly effective underarm bowler long after roundarm began. Others who sometimes bowled underarm into the overarm era were James Grundy and James Southerton.

By the beginning of the twentieth century, underarm had more or less disappeared and was rarely seen thereafter, although exceptions did occur. There were cases where a bowler had been injured and so completed his over with underarms. In more controversial circumstances, there were instances of bowlers who had been no-balled for throwing who decided to bowl underarm to get through the over.

George Simpson-Hayward was an England hero of the 1909–10 series in South Africa with his underarm bowling. Reference books often refer to him as the &quot;last great lob bowler&quot;, but other descriptions suggest he was a ferocious under-arm spinner of the ball, getting immense turn off the pitch through a fairly low trajectory, rather than being a true &quot;lobster&quot;.

== Lob bowling ==

In cricket, lob bowling is a largely disused style of bowling. It has become illegal under Law 21.1 to use underarm bowling without prior agreement before the match, an amendment to the laws of cricket that was made following the notorious incident in the 1980–81 World Series match.

It was used in the game in the 19th century, where trajectory was the most important consideration. Lob bowlers, both right and left-handed, sometimes attempted &#x27;donkey drops&#x27;, attempting to pitch the ball on the stumps from as great a height as possible, preferably with the ball descending behind the batsman standing at the crease.

The last regular bowler of lobs in international cricket was George Simpson-Hayward, in the period before the First World War. He bowled with a much lower trajectory than most earlier lob bowlers, imparting great spin to the ball with constant variation of pace as well.

Others famous &quot;lobsters&quot; include Digby Jephson. As an underarm bowler he had an action a little like setting a wood in crown green bowling.

The last specialist lob bowler to play first-class cricket in England was Trevor Molony who made three appearances in the County Championship for Surrey in 1921, by which time the style was already essentially defunct.

Charles Palmer (1919–2005), who played for Worcestershire and Leicestershire, sometimes used donkey-drops to good effect.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a story about a similar style of bowling called &quot;The Story of Spedegue&#x27;s Dropper&quot;.

Today the laws pertaining to the bowling of &quot;beamers&quot; would be likely to render that kind of bowling illegal, and it would probably be deemed a no-ball. In accordance with Law 41.7.1, a ball that passes the batsman&#x27;s waist height on the full is a no-ball.

Lob bowling is still sometimes found in low-level village cricket; these deliveries are known as donkey-drops. More usually these are over-arm deliveries; but round-arm is also possible and would more closely approximate a traditional lob.

== In modern cricket ==

Underarm bowling became virtually extinct after the First World War. Trevor Molony, who represented Surrey in three matches in 1921, is considered as the last specialist lob-bowler to play first-class cricket. However, Gerald Brodribb in his book on this subject lists about twenty-five instances since that time when underarm lob bowling was employed as an occasional tactic in first-class matches. The list of bowlers who have tried this includes Hedley Verity, Jack Iverson, Mike Brearley, George Brown, Wilf Wooller, Maharaja of Patiala and Fred Root.

Bowlers have employed underarm bowling for a variety of reasons. When the Trinidadian cricketer Syed Mubarak Ali was no-balled 30 times for throwing in a match against Barbados in 1942, he resorted to simply rolling the ball along the ground to avoid more no-balls. In similar circumstances, South African bowler Geoff Griffin did the same in an exhibition match that followed the Test against England at Lord&#x27;s in 1960, where he had already been no-balled. As rain threatened to end the match between Victoria and MCC in 1928–29, the MCC bowler Fred Barratt rolled the ball along the ground to allow Bill Woodfull to score a four to complete his hundred and Victoria to win.

But some of the modern instances of underarm deliveries occurred when bowlers did it in frustration to register some form of protest; when Lancashire batted on for too long against Oxford University at Oxford in 1990, Phil Gerrans, an Australian playing for Oxford, bowled a ball underarm. Since he had not informed the umpire of the change of action, he was no-balled. This appears to be the most recent recorded instance of underarm bowling in first-class cricket.

===Definition===
Technically speaking, an underarm delivery is one in which the bowler&#x27;s hand does not rise above the level of the &quot;waist&quot;. The &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot; now (2000 Code) declare that an underarm delivery is illegal &quot;unless otherwise agreed before the match&quot;.

A delivery is a no-ball if it bounces more than twice before passing the popping crease: an underarm delivery cannot be performed rolling along the ground. A pitched underarm delivery is a good ball, providing it only pitches once, and providing the opposing captain has agreed beforehand that the style may be used. It is unlikely that any bowler would reintroduce the style, given modern pitch conditions.

===1981 incident===

A highly controversial incident occurred in the final of the Benson &amp; Hedges World Series Cup at the MCG in 1981 when Australian bowler Trevor Chappell, under orders from his captain and brother Greg Chappell, rolled the final ball along the ground to batsman Brian McKechnie to avoid the possibility of it being hit for the six runs that New Zealand needed to tie the match.

==In informal cricket==
Underarm bowling still plays a role in informal garden cricket games, which are often played by less athletic people or young children. Novices at playing the game often find it awkward or difficult to bowl overarm or roundarm either effectively or accurately, so can be allowed to bowl underarm by general consensus. Since underarm bowling is also slower than overarm or roundarm, it is easier for novice batsmen to hit the ball, making it ideal for informal and children&#x27;s cricket.

<text>Phycobilins (from Greek: &quot; (phykos)&quot; meaning &quot;alga&quot;, and from Latin: &quot;bilis&quot; meaning &quot;bile&quot;) are light-capturing bilins found in cyanobacteria and in the chloroplasts of red algae, glaucophytes and some cryptomonads (though not in green algae and plants). Most of their molecules consist of a chromophore which makes them coloured. They are unique among the photosynthetic pigments in that they are bonded to certain water-soluble proteins, known as phycobiliproteins. Phycobiliproteins then pass the light energy to chlorophylls for photosynthesis.

The phycobilins are especially efficient at absorbing red, orange, yellow, and green light, wavelengths that are not well absorbed by chlorophyll &quot;a&quot;. Organisms growing in shallow waters tend to contain phycobilins that can capture yellow/red light, while those at greater depth often contain more of the phycobilins that can capture green light, which is relatively more abundant there.

The phycobilins fluoresce at a particular wavelength, and are, therefore, often used in research as chemical tags, e.g., by binding phycobiliproteins to antibodies in a technique known as immunofluorescence.

== Types ==
There are four types of phycobilins:
# Phycoerythrobilin, which is red
# Phycourobilin, which is orange
# Phycoviolobilin (also known as phycobiliviolin) found in phycoerythrocyanin
# Phycocyanobilin (also known as phycobiliverdin), which is blue.

They can be found in different combinations attached to phycobiliproteins to confer specific spectroscopic properties.

== Structural relation to other molecules ==
In chemical terms, phycobilins consist of an open chain of four pyrrole rings (&quot;tetrapyrrole&quot;) and are structurally similar to the bile pigment bilirubin, which explains the name. (Bilirubin&#x27;s conformation is also affected by light, a fact used for the phototherapy of jaundiced newborns.)
Phycobilins are also closely related to the chromophores of the light-detecting plant pigment phytochrome, which also consist of an open chain of four pyrroles.
Chlorophylls are composed of four pyrroles as well, but there the pyrroles are arranged in a ring and contain a metal atom in the center of it.
